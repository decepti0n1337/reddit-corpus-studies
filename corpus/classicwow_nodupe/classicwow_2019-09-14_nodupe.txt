My experience in that cave was a full 10v10 brawl go players coming and going and each faction gaining and losing control of the lower caves. It was epic as fuck.

I temember Druids doing that, and spamming the insta-cast spell Moonfire.
---
This seems like a great time! What are your tricks ?
---
Why do some mobs break out of polymorph after just a second or two when nothing hits them and they don't have any allies that could remove the debuff?

Every druid laughing right now
---
I mean its why I play
---
Yeah, who the f are they to tell other people how to play, people that race to 60 doing dungeons aren't telling people to stop questing and do what they do.
---
I guess the reasoning was to find a balance race choices, and avoid having a world full of humans. Humans have access to 6 out of 8 playable classes, and all of them make sense. They had to cut something.
---
[removed]
---
I agree. People are still only looking out for themselves. The only reason groups are forming is because there are too many people in an area killing the mobs for a quest. Had a couple times where I ask for an invite from another group and they just ignored me, then tried their hardest to tag everything in the area so I can't get a kill.
---
There was never another login noted after logging into battle.net. I changed my password just to be safe.
---
People like you are the problem with wow.
---
You don't know shit, yet you try so hard to be seen as some hard core "played since vanilla" douchebag, so much so that you'll try to min-max a game that's actually piss easy. And all to the detriment of anyone who doesn't feel exactly like you.
---
I dig it
---
Holy cow, thats so dumb.
---
Looks like a 1980s He-man action figure
---
I'd take you up on your offer but I'm horde on stalagg. Too bad too cause you are in my level range. My impression of you has successfully been adjusted. Two mages have a lot of cc so with good play that's gonna mitigate lots of the melee damage. Don't think you'd have the same success with two rogues and a paladin or whatever other healer.

No he is not. You would set up a guild/group that simply guys and sells gold for markup. You wouldn't facilitate transfers.
---
If someone says friendo I’d leave em too
---
that’s good. my character is a pacifist and incapable of killing other players. my only option when getting attacked is to sheep them and run away. that was ruined a bit back when blizzard nerfed it.
---
Don't see why not
---
2 is probably closer to thralls color.
---
I agree with those things, but those aren't min-maxing at the expense of someone else. The people who tell ret pally dps or druid tanks that they'll never find a guild to raid with and they should reroll are the problem. Let people play what they want, especially when a group cleared MC in under a week without even having full 60s, you can find a place in raids as almost any spec.

So I just installed it on the external drive and then attempted to boot WoW from my main PC (again I just copied the entire World of Warcraft folder, I did nothing else) and now it's saying I need to repair world of warcraft (on the main pc)?

Good for you, Chad. Meanwhile I have actual friends who I play with, so I don't really gotta worry about being chosen. But you do you, princess.

Have fun and fight with honor friend! For the horde!!

Just 1g
---
You know there are PvE servers right?
---
Oh my sweet baby Jesus do you need to be * technically* correct that badly?
---
I meant the local time *designated* for the *virtual game servers*, not the local time of the *physical servers.*
---
I thought that was obvious from context and didn't need to be explained, because there are no servers designated for central timezones. Apparently not, though.
---
Absolutely. Load times may slow down but WoW doesn’t install to other directories so it’s fine otherwise.
---
Define account.

A battle.net account yes if you have multiple subscriptions.

A wow account under your battle.net account no.

---
The funny thing is those people you are talking about are more than likely retail players here because of hype. They are acting that way because they are so accustomed to not having to interact with other players or the fact that they will continue seeing the same people for the ENTIRETY of the game. I'm sorry you are having a bad time :(
---
Feline swiftness is still useful even after you get TF. It increases your stealth speed outdoors, and helps you chase down runners outdoors.
---
I roll an owl with screech. My pet is basically the trash tank a lot of times. Tank holds the boss or focus target, and my pets got some threat on whatever the tank can't hold with tab sunders or shouts/tc. 
---
Honestly good hunters should be working with the tank to manage the run and make it smooth. Between trapping, pulling, fd, kiting, pet stun, pet taunt, the hunter should be doing a lot of the work in the dungeon to make things smooth.
---
Sure, you can do what you want in a MMORPG really. If your guy is someone who does that, and the game allows it, I don't see it being a no-no.
---
If this is legit im going to consider quitting. Locks being unable to release infernals on lowbies and doomguards not aggroing onto guards was just a bug i thought, but if they are purposefully removing the griefing that was in vanilla i have 0 deaire to continue playing.
---
Wot
---
He has 6 great reasons , but a list of 6 is arbitrary? Alch urself
---
You can get the same ability with the goggles helm that drops from King Mechagon. I use them on my priest to zoom in constantly and check for rares so I don't have to mount up or go in caves to check myself.
---
No
---
Have you tried a rogue? It’s the only other melee option if that’s your thing.
---
Gonna be honest, the comic isn’t great but the way the last frame is drawn is making me laugh
---
Same thing happened with me I randomly ran into an old GM that I played with during TBC. After all the different servers and layers and I happen to run into him after like 12 years in duskwood, crazy
---
Literally no one has ever said classic was hard or hardcore rofl
---
It’s not quicker than a proper solo run, due to bugged increased xp for dungeon groups though it levels you quicker than it normally would.
---
The most unrealistic part of this is the fact that you spent 40 minutes. Shit woulda taken at least 2 hours.
---
Everyday!  This is posted every day!
---
Same way warriors were dealing with aoe threat generation before. DPS discipline focusing one target, taunts to save DPS when they can't defend themselves/do something stupid.
---
Tanking isn't easy because the DPS are supposed to be doing their job of threat mitigation. It's not entirely brainless to be a DPS if you want your tank to have sanity left.
---
But nothing can really hold aggro off mage aoe. They just have to use their cold CC to deal with that.
---
If ya can't cuddle with your bro who can you cuddle with ya know?

Dude please explain lol

Guild name checks out surprise
---
Farming dungeon loot for leveling is the weirdest meta I've heard of. Anything lower than ST is not worth farming.
---
I just hit 60 last night and the only dungeon I farmed was BRD and that was only because it has end game gear for raiding.
---
Its a laid back point and click browser game, raids are too much of a co-op multihour investment that is known for WoW and such, I would never feel like investing that much effort to Runescape. It alwayswas to me such an lighthearted game, but not with tryhard raids.
---
*berserker stance
---
Questie hands down the most useful for me so far..
---
Yeah, they are..
---
I think Tauren can do 50 mins
---
What do you mean, that's a winning combination lmao /s
---
I disagree:
---
&gt; Most healers don't even heal during dungeons. You just plow through them anyways.
---
 
---
is not the same as:
---
&gt; Healers don't even heal dungeons.
---
If you're going to quote, quote. There's subtle differences that context brings out. However, I was incorrect in which quote I was referencing from his original spat at me today - I thought he was referencing several posts later because he brought up the stockades and incorrectly assumed it was my sole evidence to my developed thought. So good on you for pointing me to where he was pulling from the original quote.
---
&gt; Print screened that comment as well, will upload if you decide to edit/remove that comment.
---
Lol, I have integrity. You need not worry. Glad you have the proof to back me up if reddit servers blow up.
---
&gt; And you don't seem to be a nice party member. "No way I'm going oom several times just to give the healer some water". What kind of bullshit attitude is that?
---
Just cherry picking my comments to develop a fantasy that is untrue about me isn't a fair representation. I also said:
---
&gt; For the record, I gave each of those healers whatever was left of my stack of water and made myself some more.
---
and 
---
&gt;  I gave the healer (a druid) 80 water.
---
So to attribute me to being the "not nice" party member because of a comment made thinking about *group efficiency* is farfetched at best. I stand by my comment:
---
&gt; No way I'm going OOM several times just to give my healer some water they don't even need.
---
FYI, I respect your memory in attempting to quote me. You almost got it correct, at least the intent was fully correct. Full points.
---
Maybe, just MAYBE, you're perception of me is wrong. Wanna chat to find out more? Are you done attacking my integrity - can we talk about the actual content of the discussion now?
---
&gt; You claimed rogue and warrior dps would be lower in classic because private servers had the wrong values.
---
And what exactly is wrong about this? Boss parry was lower on private servers than it is classic. Therefore, warrior and rogue damage will be lower on classic than it was on private servers. One plus one equals two. I shouldn't have to explain this.
---
&gt; If the tanks can somehow manage to generate enough threat to let fury go full bore then fury beats out fire. Otherwise fire wins that battle and the warrior gets to do the good ole fury feign (or warrior vanish if you prefer.)
---
Threat management is literally a core part of the dps equation. Warlocks would be the top DPS if searing pain + conflag build didn't generate obscene amounts of aggro.
---
&gt; Steam has gone from about 15 million accounts to 65 million in that time period.
---
And WoW has gone from over 10m to just 1m?  It's pretty clear market saturation wasn't the reason wow started declining.
---
LoLs peak concurrent daily players was a good indication at just how many people will no life an engaging game.  The average revenue per player excluding whales was also enough that subscription isn't a big differentiator either.
---
WoW BGs are where a lot of people first got a taste for objective maps with fantasy rpg elements.

I had a friend who went by "Dragul" on Lightninghoof in Vanilla. Undead Rogue. I was a lowly troll Rogue... god I forget his first name. Talonblade I think. But he helped me level and even gave me money for my first mount at level 40. It was truly awesome. I forget what happened but sometime around BC he stopped playing and I did not see him on after that. Miss that dude, he was pretty cool. I was very young and he showed me the ropes.
---
I think a lot of the mentality from retail is still present even amongst a large portion of classic players. A lot of people probably see classic as a side gig or extra content since retail is in a lul or maybe they’re getting a bit burnt out ( I don’t know what’s going on in retail this is just speculation) or maybe they just want to see what this classic thing is all about. A lot of people are in the mind set that endgame is 99% of the game and leveling is just a means to an end because that’s what we’ve been trained to do going back as far as Cata ( maybe even wrath or BC). 
---
But for a lot of us that don’t play retail or remember what Vanilla was, or maybe even remember hearing about Vanilla things from friends either irl or in game want to enjoy a game again. 
---
Retail ( mind you I haven’t played since Legion) is designed around max level because it’s never going to take a person 1 month to get to max level, and what you do between level (100 whatever) and (100 whatever + 10) is basically irrelevant to what you actually do in that xpac. 
---
Classic is much more about the journey, and I just don’t think the general masses are in tune with that kind of game anymore...

Is it sad that I know exactly where this dwarf is in the world (of Warcraft)?
---
Yeah that NEVER happened in 2006 right?
---
This is somewhat close to reality, as ancient maps IRL weren't often concerned with accurate scale (unless they were navigation charts)
---
Not at my computer so cant recall what its called...  weak auras maybe? Might have to do some legwork and find one
---
That leaves what ? rogue , priest and hunters?
---
out of the 3 the easiest to farm with would be hunter and the play style is completely the opposite of warrior
---
elaborate?
---
I a warlock lifetaps to below 20% life and pulls aggro on purpose... or even worse, pulls packs instead of letting the tank do his designated job, you should let him die. 
---
If a warlock lifetaps to below 20%, but plays carefully and effectively regarding dps and you see him use bandages and/or cannibalism on cooldown, please heal and shield him. He needs to deserve it, but then I would heal the fuck out of him.
---
These have always been issues in classic. That’s the contract you signed when you started again - that they’re part of the game.
---
They need a third player in the middle named Su
---
If you come from a culture that reads top to bottom, sure. But those are no more inherently logical than bottom to top.
---
Yes it will work.

---
No.
---

---
Another good thing to note, this will also work on unit frames so you don't need to waste time clicking a party members frame to cast something on them
---
Wafflesncoke ftw
---
Rogue is probably better for what you want unless you have some friends to play with regularly
---
Warrior roaming with a crew is devastation
---
Rogue is devastation all by itself
---
Elemental absolutely melts. You just need a ton of potions. This is classic, everyone isn’t equal. Raids aren’t the end all be all. Play what you  enjoy. You don’t need to min max to clear 15 year old content. Ps I’ve totally been a healing Druid and swapped mid fight to tank something and saved a raid before. I’ve always been a dps shaman and saved a group by offhealing. No bad specs just bad players. Are all specs top tier dps, no that’s why you learn to maximize your utility
---
Dog whistle sucks anyway.
---
They were balanced around devs being bad (this went both ways [pre-nerf cthun was never killed, and to my knowledge pre-nerf Rag too due to devs hypeinflating the damage]). Nowadays the encounters are balanced around the assumption that raiders have boss mods. 
---
I completely agree people are over sweating class viability, but that's a byproduct of being trained for the last decade about parses, meters, class design of builder/spender, and minimal raid utility with classes.
---
Just like rolling horde, bud.
---
Hunter does it, it’s expected. When someone else does it, they’re a dick.
---
I never used the AH to make money, I had mining/skinning, I saved all the mining mats for a future profession, and sold everything I skinned to the vendor, I did a mix of dungeons/questing, most of the time grouped. but the most important part was choosing what spells to buy, I skipped and left anything that I wasn't using continually, for example my rogue friend only bought upgrades for Sinister strike and Eviscerate, and at 40 he lent me the last 8 gold I needed so we could both have our mounts straight away.
---
What spec/rotation
---
Is this really so bad? The guy didn’t ask for anything, he just accepted what was given. A bit anti social, but not everyone is super talkative.
---
Username checks out.
---
Yes that's the same thing and it affects your 3 spell types.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for scaling, there are coefficients based on things like cast time, affect, aoe or not, dot or not, slow or not etc. so +8 sp is not the same thing as every frostbolt doing 8 more damage. 
---
Here's the list  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)

When really, the story completely undermines Christianity all together, as the parable demonstrates that you don't need a moral system divined from a deity in order for you to act in an ethical way. As a Samaritan, someone who would never have even heard of Christianity, has the capacity to act with compassion for his fellow man.
---
So when you wanna train daggers you'll go find a hobbit?

We were partied in southern Barrens getting the skills for lok, noz. And whatever else. Well this mage comes by and goes " oh is this where X spawns?" we say yes and invite him. From the time we arrived and to kill was probsbly 5~ minutes but it felt like FOREVER. so this dipshit mage has either macrod /tar into his fireblast or is tab spamming fireblast, gets the aggro and immediately drops group.
---
He only claims the kill and goes " thanks. You're lucky I'm nice" and leaves. Leaving us to wait for the spawn again.
---
Fuck you mage
---
Hey I can at least respect that
---
Blood and thunder!
---
I can say with absolute certainty, this was not how groups treated that issue in classic. I've played a warrior since 2004, rolling need on a BOE you couldn't use was ninja looting.
---
It's a Motospeed GK82. I wasn't necessarily looking for it specifically but it caught my eye since it was pink. I think since then I've found a ducky brand board that's pink too, so I may have gone for that instead. This board is also 2.4ghz wireless (no bluetooth) which is pretty neat. Here's a link to the board on amazon:

The keycaps are just a custom (non) print from WASD Keyboards. The spacebar and my escape key are both custom keycaps. I believe I bought them from Etsy and Banggood. :)
---
these are the the micro-frustrations of classic that players complained about and were addressed with expansions along with class spec reworking and rebalancing. 
---
unironic "you think that you do, but you don't".
---
At this point, i just found professions which i find fun to grind and level.
---
You might even have fun leveling tailoring just for bags and to occasionally make cloth pieces.
---
Because this is a discussion about classic + or burning crusade  expansions. Discussions include people having different opinions. And I like my drakes. Never did I once state  I liked flying.  But I like the mounts
---
I lived in dungeons and it dropped a lot of cloth and greens that sold for 50s - 1g+ in SM RFK
---
Run it again!
---
You shouldn't be tapping midcombat. I tap between pulls
---
I really hope they didn’t change throwing people into the lava near MC
---
No shh
---
My favorite part of the game is 5 and 10 man content, wish they had developed more endgame progression for that. WotLK was alright, but having two versions of the same raid just different sizes felt a little lame.
---
True
---
What others have said. It will be more common with mobs significantly higher level than you.

Any tips on how to control the camera better? Whenever I try to tap the screen to adjust camera it spazzes out.

As an alliance, which is the closes flight path to scarlet monastery?
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Being a prick would actually be Need rolling it. You seem a little hurt by this. Are you a hunter too?
---
The grind is not the problem in BFA. Every single expansion including Classic has some sort of grind. 
---
The problems with BFA are how it’s implemented. By gating off the War Campaign and saying “you must finish this boring content before proceeding” is condensing and makes the grind feel more pointless. 
---
I personally don’t think the WC suits WoW as it just doesn’t gel well, they need better ways to implement the story then just a 2-3 hour single player experience that actually ties back to what you’re doing day in and day out in the open world.
---
In terms of class popularity yea
---
You're not obligated to, and warlocks that think/say as much are wrong. If a warlock starts tapping below 90% I stop healing them during combat because I have no idea if they're taking mob damage or life tapping and I can't risk spending my mana on them when someone who might really need saving could pop up.
---
Too many times I've been bitched at for letting a warlock that regularly taps to 10% during combat die to care. Too many times have I been in a group I rightfully didn't trust to not screw up, keeping my mana high for the inevitable fuckup and then a warlock starts complaining that I'm running high mana.
---
I would rather a warlock have normal damage (their wand+curse damage is plenty fine) and me have a mana safety buffer than me needing to pop very much not free potions (or an ankh) each time the group gets in trouble.
---
That design feels *wrong*.
---
Does that mace ever get replaced by anything else?
---
I’d prefer to only get heals when I get agro which is rarely. I utilize my health regen along with siphonlife plus I can always first aid and use healthstone
---
So... you single now?
---
It's kinda hard to say it depends heavily on how your quest situation is and what place you are farming. Grinding is not made equally, some mobs are amazing to grind on some are terrible. I would recommend just following a quest guide all the way to 55+(and then do dungeons for the rest).
---
While not WoW, it still relates to the discussion - it's the same exact phenomenon we are seeing with Fortnite. Catering to the ultra casual or low-skill community made the game complete dog shit. Any time a Dev has done that, the people who actually care about the game at all get shafted.

---
There will be a price plateau eventually as the bulk moves past the need for it. Just hope it wont be to high.
---
The hunter now thinks you are either a complete retard or a dick. But because you went into the nonsense about "druid bow", my bet is on retard.
---
What I'm trying to say, OP, is that you're a fucking moron.
---
Show me on the character tab where they hurt you. Was it the chest piece?
---
No I'm not a hunter you are just a prick that's it.
---
Rolling need would make you a ninja prick, not just a regular prick.
---
For sure but it’s because the tasks are always so boring. 4 islands always feel like a job because the content sucks.
---
I have no idea, but I can say approximately 3 full levels worth from about 34 til 37ish on 3 or 4 different characters between all the times I've played vanilla WoW.
---
Southshore, hillsbrad. I know it sucks
---
And I wonder how tired your friends are of carrying your fat, useless, ass.
---
almost a month ... lets relax a little bit , its been 2 weeks and 3 days so its normal that the economy isnt stable yet ... it will take a few months before it does
---
Two and a half weeks, most people are broke and still 40ish at best and not spending gold as they want their mount.  Go farm to make money.  Just grind mobs that drop decent grey items.  The AH isn't going to see the numbers you want for awhile on gathering mats as everyone is leveling those professions and selling mats often just undercutting prices so their stuff sells keeping the price low.  Sell every boe green on there usually get about double the vendor price at least.  Otherwise just grind.
---
No. I mained lock in vanilla. If you life tap so deep that you’re at risk of dying you either are crap or have no respect for the healer. Using a bandage isn’t slow or hard.
---
Are you kidding me? How many fucking low effort posts like:
---
'Look at cat on my desk
---

---
Fake wholesome interaction story
---

---
Where’s the fun of hellfiring if you *don’t* kill yourself.
---
TBC is the first expansion.
---
Today I went to SM on my warrior. Me still not having a mount, means I still charge all creatures to have some sense of ‘fast travel’. Well as I pass hillsbrad foot hills I see a low lvl horde player and I do exactly that. Just charge and keep on moving. But the guy spasmd on his movements as if he just had pee’d his pants hahah
---
So what that's just how it is, play hunter and enjoy your 30% less damage or don't.
---
Technically Chillwind Point in WPL, but you have to run through high level mobs to get to SM. The next closest is Southshore and a long run.
---
He sees you wearing that dress under your plate armor.
---
Chillwind Point, if you're ballsy enough.
---
what the shit
---
Not sure what your point is if you think gaming companies are supposed to have the same infrastructure as web service companies that act as the backbone of the internet
---
There's your problem - you went to STVietnam. I decided to go there today at 43 and said fuck it. Between the over farmed quest spots and constant ganking it's completely pointless to level there.
---
As you said though that’s not everyone.  Not by any stretch. I’m willing to bet the percentage of people playing wow who hit 60 (let alone clear raids) in the first week is way, way lower then people hitting cap on diablo 3.
---
Obviously I can’t produce any kind of stats to prove that though so it’s not definitive by any means.
---
as a former warlock, yes
---
as a former/current healer, yes
---
as a healer who watches an idiot warlock pull aggro.. no but only if he has 100% aggro
---
To me it comes down to what Blizzard and the community decide Classic is going to be. 
---
Is it a museum piece? A monument to where the game started to never be trifled with for those that want to live in this Azeroth forever? 
---
Or is it the basis of a divergent game experience that offers a more old school feel to contrast to the hyper modern feel of retail?
---
I have to keep explaining to my friend group that you don't have to spec heals or tank from 1-60. Just grab the gear for it and you're fine.

For more context, "Samaritans" are a people who are members of what might be described either as a sister faith or  rival faith to Judaism (or more accurately, both). Their scripture is extremely similar to the Torah, with some differences in theology, such as their holy site being Mt. Hebron, instead of Jerusalem. They continue to exist to the modern day and live on in several minor communities in Israel and the surrounding areas.

That's the one. It's been a while lol, haven't had the chance to play and sadly real life is getting in the way of playing Classic, although I do love to hear about it.

4 and 9 are the best price colors.

4 is pale yellow in game and very unique for an Orc. I rarely see other orcs my color.

I've actually only seen one other person put that I  the looking for group channel. Seems like most people in the area are higher levels. But I've posted it then been invited to a group usually they kick me after they ask if I'm a healer/tank/Dps etc and usually I just say healer

There are quests which you need to do to get tribal specialisation. All are detailed in the wowhead guide on leatherwroking.

Yea instead of charging a tip those people are taking your food and water and killing mobs faster inflating the economy and buying shit you probably want.

They're literally just white night elves and they even do the bounce. No thanks. Give us naga

Nice! I forgot all about mouse over macros. Thanks!

Yeah this guy druid heals.  Keep healing touch rank 4 on your bar, and max rank for emergencies.   Wait til tank is at like 60%, rank 4 healing touch +rejuv.  It's EZ.  Reapply rank 4 healing touch as needed.  Max rank for emergencies.  Just pay attention and be proactive since HT is a long cast.

Not entirely true. You can still get to many of these hidden locations such as Hyjal.

From all of us, thank you for not making this 13 different Reddit submissions.

Horde or alliance or both

Rouges always have advantage on preist. When you fight a rouge it is more about surviving and slowly picking away at their health, whilst trying to create openings in which you can heal.
---
Mage is the same but ranged. They will probably melt you but if you are able to live, it is then about depleting their mana as I believe ice block and invocation are their only regens.
---
Being shadow I believe helps against mages as you have a few options to also restore mana and being discipline helps against rouges as it makes shielding stronger.
---
Holy is good against both as it usually comes with a warrior.

&gt; These guys are so passionate they knew exactly what gear they needed what spec to choose and exact heroe composition without having to look at anything 
---
This is completely false man, honestly none really knew what they were doing when going into classic. None knew the idea way to dungeon grind, none knew how difficult MC would be etc.
---
There's 4 (caster, cat, bear, moonkin) but moonkin is t5 in the balance tree. Cheetah and seal are just travel forms. Caster is for heals, cat is for ouchies, bear is for protecc (and if you pulled too many mobs as cat). It's fun to be able to switch around between forms and abilities so easily. 
---
I wouldn't say it's hard, but it requires minmaxing and some studying so you don't end up with weird specs and rotations.

Something I find curious about it is the ruins around it. A lot of the architecture is much closer to traditional human, Stormwind style architecture. Yet the city itself (even in WC3 I think?) Differs far from that.

That would be the case if Christianity’s purpose was for people to be considered moral by their own standards.
---
Christian doctrine asserts that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and if man is judged on his own merits he deserves eternal damnation. 
---
Friend, what do you do with your guilt and knowledge that you are not perfect, and have committed immoral acts towards your fellow man and creator? If everyone doing right in their own eyes is moral, then why are we able to deem things objectively immoral like murder?

I personally liked filling sockets in later expansions. It's funny playing both tbc and wotlk and seeing how much they overdid it with sockets when they first introduced them.

Let's be honest, the de facto metric of success in society is money. You want to call me unsuccessful because of how I choose to game, well, let's see who really is "successful" by the gold standard. 
---
Your obvious dodge of my challenge leads me to believe my suspicions of you are correct. You lead a shitty, unfulfilled life of excess gaming and unrequited dreams, so you take your self loathing at what a fuck up you are out on people who disagree with you on forums such as this. 
---
Either way, it doesn't really matter to me. You're nothing more than a sad, strange little man, as inconsequential as you are insufferable. Good luck with your dumpster fire of a personality, my dude. I'm truly rooting for you to be a less shitty human being.
---
That's incorrect.
---
Yes, the people of Israel were incredibly bigoted towards Samaritans; but the origin of the phrase is a parable by Jesus where part of the point was exactly that the origin of a person doesn't matter; what matters is what they do. Good people help others in times of need, despite ethnic or religious differences.
---
(Also Samaritans were and are a religious minority in Israel, while they were regionally concentrated they did not have their own country and still don't. While there's not a lot of them left, the ones who remain are still subject to bigotry. They were considered backwards and immoral for the same reason bigots today consider people who do not follow the faith of the bigot backwards and immoral.)
---
In other words, a good Samaritan in the modern USA would be a Muslim coming to the aid of a white American.
---
Mods please. Low effort low effort low effort low effort

Hey if there is downtime for you to deal damage then I think it should be expected of you.

Especially while leveling - you really arent that active so you have plenty of time to safely dps.

Razer Nagas + Razer Synapse = 100% Worth the money for all games.

---
Woah I just got a nerd boner
---
Yes, it absolutely has been the common mindset for 15 years. High value BoEs were always rolled on by everyone a vast majority of the time.
---
Higher tier mat drops, wee bit of xp, likely closer to where you actually want to be, etc... (exceptions always exist)
---
Python and Java are probably what most schools will be teaching fundamentals in.
---
Game development is mostly going to be in C++. As for learning a language to get into gaming... honestly start wherever is comfortable and easiest for you to learn fundamentals. There's python, swift (on apple devices), java, C# (its like microsoft's java), and C/C++. IMO if you don't want to start off with easier syntax languages like python or swift then I'd rather C# or C++ than Java, but maybe theirs some bias there....
---
Also, I think one of the hardest parts of learning programming for beginners is keeping interest. It takes a bit of learning before you can actually do anything that looks cool. I was one of like 15 kids at my school that graduated recently with a BS in CS geared towards game programming (MUCH more were regular CS). Everyone else either dropped out early or switched over to something less programming intensive because art and design were more interesting.
---
I think that's why a lot of programming lessons for younger kids try to make programming more interactive so they can see something is happening when the code. Example: It's so much cooler to wire up an array of LEDs to an Arduino and have them all blink than to parse a 2d matrix with text output to a console window.

Hey, us priests are exemplary followers of the light... although some of us are into tentacles...

Where do you learn/buy the blue azure gear?
---
My tip is look for vendor shuffles. With markets being as saturated as they are, there are some items which you can buy, use to craft, then sell the crafted item to a vendor for a profit.
---
I'm not even sure what that is I've never changed my camera style and I have never had an issue I do know that some people get the mod that allows them to get a huge orbital View which has its usefulness

I got a barb second run. And there wasn't another melee dude so I got it by default. Was so happy.

You're a saint. Love seeing shamans getting after it!

This is a travesty and I will not stand for it. PUT IT BACK BLIZZARD

A year is a bit of a stretch, that's like next level casual. But yeah it took a few months
---
Bahaha no judgment, just stay away from them chidrens!
---
As long as they put Renew on you before you enter combat, it should be fine. Threat shouldn't aggro to the healer until they enter combat as well. So they can renew, then you start combat, then they give it 5-10 seconds before doing anything else and they wont be gaining threat until they join the fight.

We all spend hours upon hours playing video games, which is pointless in advancing our lives. People all want different levels of realism in rpgs.
---
&gt; Meanwhile, on retail M+ you have to use a lot of CC and coordination
---
what level M+ requires lots of CC?   I've only really pushed up to +13 but it was mostly coordination and AoE tanking.  Interrupts were important but too much CC slows it down and you wont make time.

Came here to post this.

lol they hotfix nameplates, remove MC on boats, and remove aggro on infernals/doomguards that warlocks summon yet wont do the simple things like this

The meme is they went in as 58's. I feel like that's talked about because it would be much more difficult that way. Which then means they had to know what they were doing. I'm a first time wow player, what your saying is a team of 40 mes could take down MC.  I can't even understand half the talk in trade or looking for group becuase it's in wow talk lol

It's not just that.
---
The trick for druid resto is to use downranke spells.
---
At 60 I was chain casting HT rank 4, had enough spirit + the passive talent to regen more than I was spending.
---
Before that, just use a rank that is the half of your max rank as you main healing.
---
Regrowth+Rejuv only if there is a bad situation and only on the tank.
---
If you are tauren, use that Stomp to get some breathing room.
---
If you know how to, setup a weak aura that shows you the mp5/regent tick. Learn to cast spell clustered together so to have time to let that regen mana to get something back to you.
---
I built this one for myself, feel free to use it as starting point for yourself: https://wago.io/xXs4HxvZf
---
It will need some adjustment if you are not druid.
---
Biggest change I noticed is the auction houses. There wasn’t an auction house in every major city on release. Ironforge and I think Orgrimmar were the only cities with auction houses.
---
Did you have to fight a war against a group from the opposite faction while farming those? Because I did.
---
Hahaha yeah, its from r/comedyheaven which is a bunch of memes/comics that are so bad and not funny that they somehow are funny
---
Lol whatever lets you sleep at night in your parents basement 😂
---
Eh, there are only a few mobs to avoid, which is doable and you only get killed at the bulwark, but the gy is close
---
I got to run around ironforge about an hour after launch. Was neat to see it empty.
---
Different than running around ironforge on retail and seeing it empty.
---
Been using rank 2, but it appears to be a bug or something because I can get people going from Ratchet to Booty Bay, but not the other way around.

---
It's completely normal to just invite instead of asking yes.
---
It's not rude of you to decline.
---
It is a bit off for them to be upset about your not joining, but you must understand you are taking up mob spawns that they want to kill for a quest. Normal people will understand that you are there to just grind though when you tell them.
---
Reminds me of the interview of one of the Duke Nukem devs, listing wow as one of their reasons the game was late.
---
Why the fuck are they even in the game? These were definitely added before 2.0.1, their entire purpose was to summon. They weren;'t in vanilla.
---
I want to start playing but worried my latency will be just too slow to play. Would I be able to play around 400-500? I’m working with satellite internet and that’s the best I can get in my area.
---
I can sell grey shoulders for like 400% over vendor price on the AH.  thank you.
---
I don’t know what that is. I sold my account before TBC launched for big bucks. Retail?
---
ok, noted
---
I mean if they're literally killing the mob you need it makes sense to just throw an invite. If they're in the area you can ask- like "Doing trolls?" - that's enough really.  
---
It does come off as kinda rude to decline but just say a quick excuse and it's no harm done "just grinding" and they won't take it personally unless they're an idiot.
---
To do the Axe quest lvl 30 for warrior should i do the previw lvl 20 warrior quest? Because i skiped this one
---
Damn. Yeah id say the trolls in north stv are good for grinding since they drop a lot including the pages which sell pretty nicely on the AH. Otherwise maybe find a group to grind SM with.
---
I'm not a huge fan of defending a form of blatant griefing in the name of nostalgia.
---
It's not really that fun. But elemental shaman though, oh boy oh boy. Did you know that elemental mastery guarentees not one, but two crits if you cast at the same time? Chainlightning into a frostshock and bodies be dropping.

"Hey, friend I'll help yo- nvm elevator is here."
---
This was not in vanilla though.
---
Last two times I was in the barrens the word socialism was mentioned and praise of FDR was rampant. Alt-right must be a tauren thing.
---
People also keep saying that once you get BC gear you'll be able to solo dungeons and shit.
---
From a guy who was around back then, nah. As a 70 you could maybe solo some of the lower level stuff, as a stacked 70 you could solo the mid-levels. But you're not going to be a level 70 soloing Onyxia or fucking AQ. Hell, back when I was a serious raid boy in LK, we took a 20 man to AQ and still had a decent challenge.
---
It's one expansion removed, you know? In Draenor you could go mollywop Onyxia for 4,000,000 damage a hit and shred her, sure. Couldn't do that in BC.
---
I admire swedes for their nonchalant character names, it's the same story in all games. Same story with finns.
---
I thought it was a zeppelin?
---
The world isn’t that black and white, bud
---
I swore atlas loot used to have a map of the dungeons. It didn't show where you were but showed where the bosses were and the potential rares.
---
Those details matter, spread the word to the newb-locks.
---
In addition: Low on mana/hp? Polymorph and bandage or innervate, or both(though throw a second poly after the first thing to keep it up).
---
Right, yeah, you said that already.  Point isn't that one's right the other's wrong, just that obviously we had different experiences.
---
What economy?  The game is a month old.  The economy is nowhere near where it will be when most are level 60
---
They have classic+ already, it's called Battle for Azeroth.
---
What they need to do is tell blizzard loud and clear that they want the next expansion to be more like Classic.
---
Ok, Every instance*
---
Supply and demand
---
Generally on difficult pulls, the leader will mark enemies as well. Skull means primary focus, x is next target, and moon is cc. Polymorph will help your tank and healer manage the pull better
---
Thank you sir
---
Man, this one is funny, i hope people start using this one everywhere
---
so that would be a spell cleave, not a melee cleave
---
It seems the AH is gonna be fucked for most of phase 1.  You can make a goos profit buying items and vendoring them at this point...
---
Is there any benefit to doing that for them?  It seems like people that just don’t know the price because why wouldn’t they just vendor it?  Maybe just an inexperienced player. 
---
Unless somehow this benefits the person doing it.. I’m kinda new so won’t pretend to know about the economy but why would anyone do that?
---
Yeah now I have to stack on Arcanite and sell it in a month or two.
---
All these people who say that world pvp was dead must only have experience on private servers or something. It took me so long to get my flying mount in BC, otherwise I was just riding around like any other chump. There was plenty of world pvp in every zone, actual objectives for it too. The town in Nagrand, the spires in Zangarmarsh, the little fighting pits in HFP.
---
Ulduar was the peak imo, not only because the raid itself (which to this day still is the best designed one) but the conceptual changes that came with it.
---
Trial of the Crusader was the raid that started the difficulties bloat and the "everything before the current raid is irrelevant" philosophy, then with ICC came the LFG... and the rest is history.
---
2 boe blues by level 27, one was the night watch shortsword, the other was black velvet robes. Sold the sword for about 3.5g, still have black velvet robes.
---
Dude stfu Other Mages don't know how much that shit is and I mean sure I tip but it's like 10s for 40 Mineral and 40 Pumpnickel, not the fucking Voss water the general stores sell. Fuckin Nestle tapped Azeroth is the only way to explain those prices.
---
Gnomeregan and later Lower Blackrock Spire. I just love those long and twisty delves through enemy territory.
---
Just like they already nerfed demo roar/shout saying it was bugged... It wasn't it was like that for years.
---
Undercutting by a hefty sum is not crashing an economy. That's an economy stabilizing. If those arcanite bars put up for 25g isn't instantly bought and replaced for 64.99g to undercut you, then clearly you were selling them at a way too high price.
---
Save your bars for when we get closer to MC farm status and tanks want to start getting mats Rey for Thunderfury. The game is 2.5 weeks old and you expect to be making hundreds of gold a day from arcanite? Cmon
---
Supply and demand.
---
No it's not true. What op fails to realize is the barrens is not a contested zone therefore those players aren't flagged for pvp even in pvp servers.  Exactly like classic.
---
Luna Unit Frames
---
"He's being a prick" Yea, I'm being the toxic one. I'm returning the favor.
---
When I was leveling my mage back in 2007 I had a friend on Azuremyst server that was an alliance rogue named Vapid. She helped me quest any time I needed help, and was a true friend. We never exchanged information, and  I still wonder what happened to her.
---
Bittersweet stories hit hard :( I’m glad you still play together here on classic with the friends you made back then.
---
As an aside... ZOMBGIEF! I know him/her through his/her awesome funny art posts on the LoL sub.
---
/spit
---
Why would a healer want agi, a stat he'll only get the most out of if tanking. Str gives better throughput on damage, and even though you'll be sacrificing crit Sharpened Claws more than make up for it. The scaling of cat form with +agi is pretty bad until a much later patch that fixes it.
---
r/choosingbeggers
---
That’s a solid plan.  I had a guildie who got a very good tanking epic and was trying to sell it now but I gave him the same advice.. it’s worth more than the current population has to spend so just wait.   Time is on your side with quality merchandise
---
In vanilla a shaman could use sentry totem to pause their falling and avoid falling damage by reseting their fall height position every time they swap vision between totem and character.

The embodiment of "Hordes are everywhere, it's impossible to catch one solo", but in an awesome way.
---
I rarely ever ask, if I see someone farming the same mobs I'm killing for a quest. I'll usually follow it up with *quest name*? Or something but when you just get declined and the "don't wanna share xp" it is a little annoying, especially when it's a mage killing half the zone at once and leaving nothing for me to tag 😅 It can get frustrating but I get their reasoning and I've def never bitched about it like what you're describing. 
---
Tldr; not weird to get spontaneous invites but the people complaining are babies
---
was thinking to myself that it sucks that there's more 'toxic' type players on classic than i've generally seen on pservers or actual vanilla... but tbh it's actually incredible how generally 'good' the community is.  it's unheard of in modern online gaming
---
sure they can, Starfire, wrath, moonfire, insect swarm + roots
---
we're talking about leveling right? not being competitive on DPS meters in a raid enviroment
---
Cant be unhappy with the state of the game or you're BANNED
---
Exactly!  We're just looking out for the overall health of the server and ensuring more people get an opportunity to run dungeons is all.
---
Class Halls were in Legion, they were cross-faction areas specific to each class.
---
I definitely want tmog in classic.  Screw your curmudgeonly nostalgia i want to be pretty
---
As a hunter in BC, who was rolled after launch, I finished the expansion with about 25k honorable kills. Lots came from BGs, but I'd say 7-10k were from open world pvp. Nagrand was always a huge, hotly contested area on my realm. You could always find pvp outside of Shatt. Outside of raid zones, too, there was almost always something kicking off.
---
Im currently leveling a Mage 28lvl with a friend every day for about 5-6h and a Druid 29lvl during the time I’m alone.  
---
Best thing I like about this is that I have LW + skinning on the druid and Tailoring + skinning on the mage, so the leather from both goes to the LW and all the cloths go to the mage for tailoring.
---
I got a blue 6 bag drop in Northshire....  Felt like an epic when I got it.

Unfortunately my server is a bit behind the others. Less that 100 60s alliance side. Devilsaur is pretty expensive still.
---
You must be talking about Whitemane.
---
Listen pal, theres a way for you to keep your classic and us to get TBC. Don't ask the community to stop wishing just because you don't want it. If the guys with good ideas were gone, you wouldn't have the opportunity to relive your childhood in Classic now would you, wise guy?
---
For levelling spirit is equal to agi for hunter, and hunters would love the int for mana
---
Buy all the low priced ones and repost at actual value.
---
I just did one successfully from Booty Bay to Ratchet a minute ago. Seems to still work
---
On the other hand, quit wasting time for no reason when the rest of the group is on full mana and hp. So many times the tank just stands there for 30 seconds like fucking pull already
---
That mage was terrible. &lt;.&lt;
---
Honestly I looked at that set and instantly thought "druid tank". It'd be a sweet set for a levelling druid, no?
---
I finished the quest Pariahs Instructions in Mara and dont know how to make the  amulet. How do I do it?
---
Amazing video but that hunter wasn't good.
---
I completely agree with you
---
Haven’t said much? They’ve been reducing the layers and putting cooldowns on layer hopping. If you layer hop too much you’ll be stuck in your layer for an hour.
---

---
Two words: Zone chat.
---
This thread is cancer.
---
Welp thats how i bought mine in 2011. Someone lost theirs and i got a turnkey $800k home for $459k
---
So you were just questing normally and tried to get in group and they spit on you? Doubt.
---
You sure that wasn’t after some trash talking or tag stealing? You’re living in the bubble, bud.
---
Aside from the few negative encounters, I’ve been blown away at the level of cooperation and teamwork in Classic compared to other games.
---
Sounds like Classic just isn’t for you and judging your personality from this one-sided delusional diatribe, I say riddance.
---
We all did in vanilla. It's one of those things that someone won't know about until another druid tells them. Just spam rank4 all day. Never ran OOM or even close. Highest rank was reserved for nature's swiftness oh shit moments.
---
I know lol. PvP servers are fun.
---
Shoot twice ask questions later
---
I think it would be 2 mage, warlock,warrior &amp; a priest.
---
Frost mage for slow, arcane mage and lock for burst, priest for bubbles, warrior to help juggle mobs.
---
Requires coordination though as the group has to huddle pull and mages are squishy.
---
You can do it with double arcane or frost but locks can soul stone the priest just in case.
---
The issue with dual wielding is that gear while leveling does not provide the hit needed to do damage.  Rogues get hit from talents, and warriors get it from gear at 60.
---
You can be the rebel if you want, but dual wielding just isn’t a good idea while leveling.
---
Normally what my days have been looking like: Come home, get in queue, take a shower, throw away any trash i left out the night before (bottles/cans), go grab dinner, eat dinner, turn on Hulu.
---
Normally Whitemane is a 2 hour queue, finish this list with about 30 minutes left to watch TV before the grind begins. Watching Atlanta right now while waiting/browsing reddit.
---
"I like my women dumpy and droopy wit halitosis"
---
What's a queue? Roll alliance on kurinaxx
---
Dont worry, I'll take a Polaroid of my cellphone taking a picture of my monitor showing my screencap of the cellphone picture of the printscrn key meme, just for you!
---
I’m speaking for rogues alone
---
I have a 34 rogue and a 29 warrior. Im worried about grouping at 60, wpvp viability, and gear competition.
---
As a warrior, i enjoy tanking, so finding groups isnt hard.  Gear competition wont be too big (horde, so no paladins).  Im not sure what warriors are like pvp wise at 60.
---
As a rogue, ive never leveled one to cap and i can blow shit up fast. Being sneaky is always fun, and pickpocket is a great money maker. World pvp is easier approached (stealth, stuns) but.im not sure about finding dungeon spots at 60/getting geared up.
---
Which do i cap out first and why? Are there any points im missing in regards to the pros and cons of each class?
---
Thabk you!
---
Herod is super populated and I've heard that Ally/horde is 40/60%.
---
"..my first epic drop.." as if you're guaranteed to see another boe epic.
---
Oh the rarest form of pvp, 1v1.
---
Quest NPCs taste the best though!
---
Sounds rare as fuck.
---
The idea of there being a single explanatory feature is really magnetic. People want there to be an explanation for things and not being able to point to one makes them feel really uncomfortable. The decline of wow being based on a number of factors denies the existence of the single answer that doomed retail and thus it makes people uncomfortable.
---
Reminds me of one of those private servers except there it was AoE xp groups out in the world because of the ridiculous dynamic respawn rate across the server plus the bonus xp for grouping that was added as a feature.
---
Good news is, if this plays out the same way there will be a lot of Mages re-rolling once the server starts running raids.
---
By the time we were doing AQ40 we were recruiting mages because so many had retired their AoE grinding mage and didn't have the gear to raid at that level or were invested in whatever class they re-rolled to.
---

And yet, all the Whitemane cosplay, art and ~~porn~~ only took off some time after Cataclysm.
---
Hey guys I don’t intend to hijack this threat but I just ordered a laptop without knowing anything about computer specs. I seen “gaming” in the name for a reasonable price and ordered it. 
---

---
Is this laptop going to preform okay for classic wow?
---
You're overcharging like crazy. 
---
At this point 30g is a fair price, 20 is great and anything over 35 is totally unacceptable.
---
Pathetic, took you long enough what a dead server.
---
No. All the new blood elf units were alliance in wc3ft
---
problem is all this "everything has been mathed out" has been mathed out on private servers that had things wrong
---
and much of the druids bad mentality from the early days is from before the 1.2 patch that buffed dire bear form from 125% extra armour to 360% extra the stigma of a spec underperforming lasts a very long time go ask fire mages in BFA
---
i feel fucking called out
---
So i'm going to run the numbers at what my current classic warrior is at(i also played one during vanilla, but this is what I can use real numbers with) My current shield has a 6 block rating, 378 armor and I have right about 70 strength at level 20.  The damage reduction from a black is calculated at shield block value + 1/2 your strength, which would make the damage reduction every time I block 41.  The shield block skill usable by warriors increases the block value by 75%, so rounded down we are at 45 damage per black while that is up(not a huge difference at this level but a difference).  My warrior has 729 health at this level, so I'm mitigating about 6.1% of my total health per block, which can add up quickly when being attacked by multiple mobs considering this reduction happens after the armor calculation.  Add to this fact that if you block an attack, it cannot crit you.  A shield is quite useful, despite your feelings about them.  Add in the fact that the warrior in beserker stance is taking 20% more damage than you would in defensive stance(10% more for beserker+ 10% less for defensive)  Over the period of a fight this mechanic can make you take significantly less damage the the 2h warrior in beserker stance(the original point of this thread).
---
May the Eternal Sun shine upon you
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll go 2H.
---
Do you post shit like this a lot? Because I fucking love etymology, especially when it comes to euphemisms.  If you do I will follow and even buy those stupid Reddit coins.
---
I would hate to see his cousin then
---
Okay, I don’t read whole threads and just respond to what people are saying. That’s why I said it more than once. And people are literally telling me I’m wrong when I’m not, so don’t say “it’s not about being right or wrong”. Because I am right, that’s how I approached that situation when I first played the game.
---
bruh xD
---
Keep your retail put of my classic!!! Reroll or live with it, you knew what your class would be like this is a decade old game.
---
All I am picturing is a giant baby screaming at his mom because someone is making more money than him.
---
Had a human warrior camping that castle in Durotar. Level 8 twink. The next day he was still there and my buddy had reached 14 so we met up and killed him twice. Did a little well earned corpse dance. So he logged into his high elvel night elf and obliterated us a couple times.  
---
Just like back in the day.
---
Spotted the Ninja.
---
Ahhh, brings back memories!
---
If you haven’t seen The Boys you need to.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
I do enjoy it when the community takes things like this into their own hands though. I’m a troll hunter that went on a date with a gnome mage two nights ago. It was weird and hilarious. Left many a warrior alone while I was grinding my WW axe and they returned the favour. Some even /nodded. I don’t need Blizzard carrot-sticking me to these kind of interactions.
---
Doing well from our perspective doesn't necessarily mean more subscriptions, I'd argue the inverse is true and is what caused the downfall of Wow in the first place.   It's nice to know we weren't alone in our desire to play an older version of the game, but it doesn't need millions of players to be great.
---
Oh boo-hoo.  Guess now you'll just have to kill the opposing faction.
---
But what if he has a message for me UwU
---
Same thing happen to me end of wod( end of 2016) , i ignored almost all random guild invites, however there was an invite that i accepted for some reason, a few days later i saw a familiar name gotten accepted, i whispered and it was an old friend i did not talk to irl from 2009 ! And not to mentioned he quit since cata and came back just before legion and that he chose the server i am in randomly!
---
They're wrong, even with mana pots and demonic runes Ele Shamans will go OOM 3-4 mins into a boss fight.
---
I’m not waiting for you to get Afro when your not gonna keep it and I can dumpster these mobs anyways
---
Signed, 
---
A mage.
---
Fuck yes found my brethren
---
Sniff sniff. I can smell.  Hmm yes it’s a piece of shit. Probably a mage too.
---
As a mage, how can I effectively select my targets? When there are many enemies at once in dungeons especially, the camera and name badges cause me to click on the wrong enemies when they are running around and a lot of the time I select my own teammates, causing an invalid target error.
---
I hate temporary events in MMOs, my FOMO kicks in and I just get discouraged from playing when I permanently miss things.
---
I'm still waiting on your source buddy...until then your claims are a fart in the wind.
---
Layers will vary in population in blizzards effort to get a server on a single layer by phase 2.
---
+1 here, the mods absolutely suck on this sub and need to get off their power trip. My singular post got removed as it apparently belonged in a weekly thread, despite being much more lengthy than your average post, with a lot of actual thought behind it; within a few hours I saw multiple other posts asking the same question I did, a sentence or two in length, that had a bunch of comments and were allowed to stay. 
---
Mods - have a day off, you clearly need it.
---
Reminds me of Verycoolguy
---
Craft with tailoring or buy on AH
---
Skarmbrena? No fucking way rofl
---
Played on Boulderfist back in the day. Fun fact, there was a guild on that server called Druid Raid Officers which was an all druid guild.
---
Another fun fact, a mutual friend told me Skarm went to jail for statutory rape. I guess the first fun fact is more fun.
---
Nerfed ragnaros as well, isn it? I recall MC having been developed in 1 week and as such had a lot of shit that was simply too strong, though it being made in 1 week also shows that it was a very, very basic raid.
---
Tbh my ideal comp includes a Warlock and does not always include a mage
---
There is NO such thing as crashing an AH economy. The prices are determined by the servers community and willingness to buy/sell at certain prices. The sellers decide what cut is worth it, the buyers decide what they are willing to pay. Over time it will change, but that's just how a free market economy works. 
---
There are no minimums or maximums for what an item can be listed as. That's the whole point.
---
“They haven’t said AS much”
---
Specifically in reference to active reduction of layers. They have only said that there aren’t as many layers as people think, and that exploitation isn’t as rampant as people think.
---
Not all of us are retards 😭 ive never played wow so nelf hunter looked fun didn't know if be as loved as a pedo on jail yard
---
This is at the top of the known bugs list
---
Trying to make life worse for someone else to make yourself feel better or more entertained falls into the 100% black category.  You feel ok about it because of the anonymity of the internet.  It's not called trolling because sometimes nice people do it.
---
Were you just having a bad day?  Could be.  Does that make it any less black?  No.  Does it make you a bad person?  Maybe it wouldn't have if you hadn't have felt the need to brag about it.  Which means you think its an ok thing to do which either means you're an ass all the time, you crave attention constantly, or you just don't understand social interactions.  Maybe all of the above.
---
I adventure into molten core and somehow got into the spirit realm
---
M'man tried to use a lightning shield charge on fall damage, you gotta appreciate the optimism.
---
Were people actually buying arcanite bars for 65g or were they just sitting?
---
There's some stupid prices on arcanite in my server, but I've been watching and none of them are actually selling.
---
Rewatched these the other day. Miss those guys!!!
---
If you struggle with the english language I can understand this statement. If english is your first language... NEED IS NEED and GREED IS GREED. Learn the difference and click accordingly. You don't NEED gold. You want it. If your toon can use the item and it is an upgrade that is NEED. 
---
Ninjas always trying to justify their ninja.

Ugh.. *cringe*

Pro tip: Don't spec into restorative totems.
---
That is an amazing screenshot! Thanks
---
I have some interesting gadgets to show you. Back at my place....
---
The economy is in shambles because of layering.
---
What guild are you in?
---
&gt;You have to go dungeon grinding to level fast enough.... but fast enough for what?
---
So I can level alts
---
&gt;Sure you can try to be part of the Ragnaros first kill on the server .. but does it really matter? It was done 15 years ago..
---
So I can be geared come phase 2
---
Someone sounds salty
---
If you are trying to do this to horde who aren't flagged you can't do anything to them until they enter a contested area.
---
That's why ally can't do anything to us at SM
---
That’s so sad and disappointing
---
Perfect technique on the rogue's part
---
crushing blows can not crit ever
---
Didn’t ask
---
Thank you, this is exactly what was happening..
---
I'm in an Illegal Danish. What server are you on?
---
If you want to target the tank's target just click the tank and hit F. If you're searching for something else just use the tab button to cycle through enemies. Also look into nameplate addons. Find one that you like and clicking the intended target will likely get much easier.
---
Oh definitely, Vanilla gear can be a bit silly, but the colors and general designs are fairly controlled and dilute, TBC was a lot more outlandish (pun intended) which made the clownsuits so much worse.
---
Man I’ve been rocking up to SM and trying to sell summons for silver
---
No one’s biting :/ maybe because SM is too close to UC.
---
-a pally
---
....and he touched my ass.
---
hahahahahahajajahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahhahahahahahahaahhaahahahhahaahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahah
---
Doesn't matter. Can do WW quest regardless.
---
Idk where you are but Horde Grobb has this constantly too...
---
I got to stop grinding, use a full mana bar to make only a couple waters at a time, drink up an you’re going to complain?? Nahhh. That’s why I just charge people for water now.
---
This is LITERALLY how a free market works
---
Was in one of those back in vanilla. Shoutout to Druids of the Thorn in Perenolde
---
Cool story. Here’s a 🎖
---
I sell the set for 275g on my server right now and it sells instantly.
---
Also, people are underestimate the demand for these items. Its bis for many classes for a long while especially if you arent priority for loot in your raid.
---
Since my server found out i can craft the set, i get 7+ whispers each night from people asking me to craft it for them with their mats. Id estimate 1/3 of the devilsaur sets worn on my server right now have my name on them. Feels good :)
---
Lmao how clueless are you, retail Mythic raids don't get cleared on 1 day 
---
I guarantee you though that your shitty Naxx 40 is gonna get cleared within a few hours by hundred of guilds when it releases
---
Why use a macro? You can bind target markers in your keybind settings.
---
&gt; people totally do realize that, the only people who look at cat druid and rogue side by side and actually pick cat as their main
---
Or they could just want a more varied playstyle really. Rogues are a one-task efficiency class but generally boring as hell to play. Druids are flexible and really fun to play, but as a result can't realistically perform as well as a rogue does in that one task.
---
I chose to level a rogue this time around myself instead of a druid but I'm already regretting it a little bit, because it isn't a terribly exciting adventure to say the 'least. While I'm sticking through with my choice I don't see the attention seeking in willingly gimping yourself a bit if it means you get to have more fun.
---
This guy is the opposite of the good shamaritan that saved the rogue from the dwarf hunter in shimmering flats that was posted yesterday
---
One dropped the other day in my group. The pally rolled need and beat the rogue for it.
---
good
---
I get really excited when a mob dodges.  That means I get to press a button.
---
I have no idea what’s happening
---
MCP?
---
I rolled PVE for exactly this reason, even though i'd rather be on a PVP server. Playing Ally on one of the big PVP's just seems to be asking to get locked into a shit experience because of the imbalance
---
Get out, please.
---
Do you think tanking with a two-handed weapon is something a noob or moron does?
---
It's absolutely optimal in a lot of situations, if the tank isn't an idiot and the healer and party can handle it. Essentially you eat a little more gaming but you do double or triple the dps and hold aggro like a champ. Since you don't get a bonus for having the healer spend less Mana healing it's usually the best way to tank a dungeon unless the healer or you are so undergeared that it risks deaths.
---
Health of mobs and other players was not information that was exposed to you in vanilla. The mods that showed health of a target had to guess by amount of damage done to a target from the combat log and % of health lost from the UI.
---
Are the nights darker? I'm at 10 graphics settings and it's barely darker than day time, theres just no sun.
---
Except in your example, they initiated combat.  Please learn to read.  You don't get any tough guy points here.
---
&gt;Haven't seen yours either. All the ones you linked were vague and have no precise information.
---
&gt;
---
Then not only are you dumb, but also ignorant. Again, your claims are a teardrop in the rain; a fart in the wind.
---
&gt;A layer is supposed to be a pseudo server, hence the term layer, they're layering additional servers on top of each other. There is no reason that a layer would change total population. As it's limited by their technology or their ideology. A server, aka Arugal, would have varying numbers of layers determined by total players trying to play on the server.
---
&gt;&gt;There is no reason that a layer would change total population. 
---
Now you're switching what you initially said and that statement agrees with me. 
---
&gt;Again, have a set number of layers would be stupid, and is counter to what layers were originally designed to do.
---
I've already said that layers change depending on the current population of the server, more layers are added as the population increases until the server hits maximum capacity.
---
So as a Sham can I go ele dps when I hit 60? Or is there basically no mail gear that has int on it?

We had a couple of close 1v1s, but he'd always gank me after I start attacking a mob OR wait for an ally, classic rogue!
---
I've tried that. /leave and /join but nothing shows up in the chat box.
---
Just like your subjective reasons, then.
---
"No no no, MY subjective reasons are the correct subjective reasons!".
---
Good lord.

it doesn't work as it used to be back then, they did something can't even avoid the gangs now lol

It only negates the point if you don't consider the difference between BoE and BoP, which is an extremely important point to neglect.  Pretty much everyone agrees that needing on BoP that isn't an upgrade is bad manners.
---
I like to sheep, /train emote, and run away as a gnome. It’s hilarious.
---
He's the only pet in the game with 1.0 attack speed. Spell push back in vanilla and classic has no diminishing returns, so the 1.0 attack speed makes hard casting spells very difficult when broken tooth is attacking a caster
---
I tried to have my whole LBRS group do the mother’s milk quest last night but 5 people randomly netting the entire team made the run impossible
---
Get rekt scum
---
Perfect
---
2 gigs?  Closer to 4.5 for me.
---
I had boomer and zoomer but we ended up changing servers
---
Cats killed the game. I liked WoTLK.
---
Simple, but good list, have my upvote.
---
The games been out a few weeks dude, calm down. It'll sort itself over time.
---
What was good in a resto/balance build? You have a build in mind?  Sorry for asking,I started a druid in classic and I have no idea where I'm going
---
I use it every fight first thing, even when soloing. The damage reduction is legit.
---
You're right... He struggled to keep up post res, but no joke he followed me around for 30 minutes, then sat on my body (when the screenshot was taken) for another 15-20!
---
If I remember correctly it's not all that great. You see these WF proc videos and get excited but without good gear (and even with good gear) decent players will kite you all day in PVP or melt your face. PVE you pretty much heal or gtfo.
---
Wait so why is it less entitled or greedy to want a free upgrade to your kit?
---
Well, that's the point of the discussion.  BoE tend to be significantly worth more monetarily than BoP.
---
Nobody does that.
---
if anyone has learned anything from APES, its drop all this min/maxing shit. YOU DONT NEED IT TO BEAT END GAME CONTENT. let the ret pallies ret, let the prot pallies tank. Sure its not optimal but its still duable. Play how you want with the people you want and youll have fun. Fuck how everyone else wants to play or how they should tell you to play. Live your own life, do your own shit, if people dont like it move on, or they can. its simple.
---
That's a terrible analogy but ok
---
Nice
---
Had to build up IRL rage first!
---
Dire Maul was never VC...

Imo griefing is part of wow; adds to the class fantasy

That can easy get you killed once mark is off ^^
---
I think everyone can agree a 2g blue is vastly different than a 50g twink bis
---
Well you guys are playing down there talents lol not me
---
yeh I just gave up and went back to questing
---
Coz NW got bought out by Delta, silly! ;)
---
Nope, Whitemane
---
As a rogue with no improved sap, yes the tank can pull.  If I **must**, I will pop sprint, sap, run the fuck back to the tank and vanish.
---
Really? It's incredibly useful if you're fighting multiple enemies.
---
Hasn’t happened yet ;) haha

&lt;$15 for a month is worth the risk that you won’t like it: You will like it though!
---
What are people's opinions on going elemental leatherworking as rogue. Apparently there's already someone on my server who's found the devilsaur patterns, so they should be selling the devilsaur items for profit.
---
As far as I can see, going elemental for molten core seems valid, from there on out picking up best in slot.
---
And afterwards I'll probably re-learn herbalism and Alchemy, unless someone can tell me LW is worth it comes the next phases.
---
its nice to just get the ability
---
This is a great time to start.  $15/month or cheaper if you buy long subscriptions.  Classic is worth every penny.
---
Man if ppl are gonna shit on ferals screw them :-) They can be so useful for raid
---
Its so much fun man a true mmo. 18$ a month Canadian
---
Elvui by Tukui! Great UI addon that lets you customize a ton of things! Also a ton of other Addons that are QOL Addons, stuff like questie, sexymap, and I also like a junk/gray selling addon!
---
That was me. Thanks for the water and rezzes chump, I'm gonna fuck your girl friend while you're making me some more water LMAO.
---
Sub cost about 12$ a month. 
---
I would say one thing. The game is very time consuming. If you have alot of time to play go for it 100%.
---
This is the best game I have ever played. The best community to support new players
---
No, sentry totem is a later patch where that has been fixed
---
On use weapons such as the pummeler can be used in forms. Other than that they are just stat sticks.
---
Nah, I only help if they're being ganked. If they were clearly the attacker, they can go fuck themselves. Just in case, I usually send a whisper to ask if they are getting revenge or not.
---
Well, I would if I had some context.
---
I still don't get the leap they made from actual Draenei to the Dranae we get in game. Don't come at me with some shit about the broken, either, those things are also clearly unrelated to the broken Draenei in expansions.
---
Warrior PvPers will usually have a pocket healer.
---
the use of their limited polygon budget was perfect

Not saying this OP runs the website linked, but whoever does just took the images from there and posted it to their site, which is full of garbage ads. Yeah, no thanks.
---
&gt;Friend, what do you do with your guilt and knowledge that you are not perfect, and have committed immoral acts towards your fellow man and creator?
---
What do I do? Well I try and do the best I can and live to have a positive impact on the world like any healthy and reasonable person does. You know, like all those BILLIONs of souls that Christianity has damned to hell because they had no chance of hearing the 'saving' power of Jesus's message.  
---
  
---
What's that, you're a liberal Christian that believes there are many paths to Salvation and Jesus's message was just for the people and context of his time? Great we agree then, I'm hindu as well so we can be friends.
---
It wasn't very popular to WPvP back then, but these days a lot of people are losing hard IRL and want to take it out in a place where they aren't powerless I guess.
---
Efficient in terms of mana maybe I honestly don’t know. But on Alliance side Paladins quickly have near infinite Mana or an incredibly large Mana pool anyway.
---
The thing with Mana efficiency is that it really doesn’t matter. You need to have enough Mana to last the fight without going OOM.
---
Also many classes, Paladins and Shamans specifically, have very strong party buffs. So you kind of want many of them to buff the groups their in.
---
I honestly don’t know for sure though. I love Druids.
---
You should be able to remove the nostance modifier from this and have it work the same.
---
That's what my mom said when I told her I was Playing WoW, so...
---
Exaclty. Max rank HT is just for Out of Combat heal or "Oh shit" with Nature's Swiftness otherwise it's just too slow/expensive :)
---
Yeah back in vanilla/BC days my brother mained a rogue and I would jump on it on occasion when he wasn't playing.  It was pretty fun playing on what essentially a cat on steroids but (granted I never went on raids with it) the extra utility it brought over my druid in cat form never made up for the ability to switch to tanking/healing at a moments notice.
---
Also I never really appreciated how smooth and mobile playing a druid is until I pvped with his rogue.  Every single time I actually got rooted I wanted to ragequit.
---
So what I just watched was a difficult move or what? Very confused.
---
I think that it might be because, we are taking our time. Going at a steady pace trying to experience the old world again and all it has to offer. Making sure we experience as much as we can like we did back then at a somewhat similar pace as we did back then, for nostalgia. 
---
I do know that this pace isn't for everyone as some do find going fast more enjoyable. 
---
I was just expressing my fear that it's going to cause Blizzard to go at the pace of those who are going 100 miles a minute. 
---
I know they can't make everyone happy. I'm hoping that maybe a middle ground can be reached.
---
Soon you should get an ability called Fade, which wipes a ton of threat. So if you pull aggro, you cast fade (it’s instant) and they’ll usually switch back to the tank.
---
Holy shit
---
So satisfying.

Take your own advice stop being a damn snowflake

Who can i talk to about getting a more user-friendly way to look at quests? I mean for like quest chains, its impossible to find the next quest in the chain without manually searching for it. I actually really like how wowdb's quest interface is for quest chains

They're susceptible to crushing blows (can't push them off the hit table).  Their armor can make up for this somewhat, but a bad streak can kill a druid tank in situations where a warrior would have survived.
---
Yeah that's why only 1% of the vanilla population ever saw raids... Because it was targeted at casuals....

Hey I have a couple of more questions if you don't mind?

Every day I get a whisper saying they'll tip and even come to my location for water.

I remember in Wotlk I took part in an all druid Naxx run.
---
Multiboxing ay ?
---
modern gold farming bots , nice
---
I see, thank you. I just put in all 3 of these macros, thanks for posting about them. I think I used  to use stopcasting back in Vanilla but forgot about it, but I didn't know about the conditional ranks thing.
---
[This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUAI6ABS3-U) (he is very cool) plays an entirely different game as well
---
Grobbulus (RPPvP) is actually slightly Alliance favored!
---
I would love to have this feature as well, as a healer it sucks not to see the pets and I totally hate the raid frame style.
---
Purge ice barrier, earth shock the non rank 1 frost bolts and ground when on cd. They're not hard to beat. Since they have a tiny hp pool and parely any armour, one wf crit or an Ele Shaman can drop a mage at the push of a button
---
I was questing in stv, and grinding next to me was a druid named Lucilius. He was a huge rival of mine on his dwarf hunter in vanilla and still remembered me. BSed a bit. Then added each other as friends.

As an Mage on Alliance I always sheep Horde Warriors that are low on health after fights to heal them up.

Their friends still kill me, but I try.

All I use is hunters mark and serpent sting.  I’ll throw in arcane shots if I need to burn something down fast or if I’m sitting at full mana.

Friend, let me teach you the secrets of eternal happiness and power over all these pitiful others.
---
Step 1:you are a bear.
---
Step 2: /join world.
---
Step 3: /4 (or /5 in your case) "LF4M for \[insert dungeon name here\], need healer and 3 dps".
---
Step 4: bathe in the whispers of the pitiful as they grovel at your feet begging for an invite.
---
Step 5: kick anyone who is rude or acts like an idiot.
---
Step 6: Congratulations, you're now the king of all dungeons, master of your own group and god of choice. 
---
Step 7: Profit.
---

---
Isnt flametongue weapon with a fast 1h and a shield the best way to level enhancement?
---
Equipping an item is a higher priority of usage than selling it so you can buy some other item.
---
That blue staff you want to buy didn't drop.
---
That doesn't mean you get to need roll a blue dagger so you can sell it and buy your staff.
---
If someone in the run can equip it and use it as an upgrade, that's the highest priority. Period.
---
If the group agrees to need roll on any valuable drops, that's totally fine. I'm not saying it's not okay to set that up if that's what the group agrees to.
---
If you want that to be the loot rule for the run, then you need to set up the run and explain that thoroughly to everyone.
---
Otherwise, the default rules are need over greed, period. No amount of twisted logic will change that, and needing a valuable item to sell it when others are needing to equip, is ninjaing.
---
If the group can't all agree on needing valuable boes, then don't run with that group, or default to the way things are understood and supposed to be done by all the other players that aren't ninjas.

You should definitely consider putting a point into Holy Nova. Its a really nice ability to have when a melee is on you and you're trying to run away. Can be used on the move, can't be interrupted, heals yourself and damages them. Of course its a big mana sink, but that doesn't matter if you were going to die anyway. Also nice if you're ever doing any kind of big wpvp trying to wipe a raid - pop your sapper charge and spam nova. Definitely worth the 1 talent point imo.
---
The coding is very clunky still. Def still in alpha
---
Booo! Make wow great again!
---
Another good tip in addition to the one above:
---
If you’re in a dungeon, all the mobs will usually be targeting the tank. So just target anybody and hit F F. That’ll target your target’s target, which is often the one that everyone is focusing. 
---
Also, in a best case scenario, your tank / party leader would put a moon on the CC, skull on the first mob to kill, and an X on the second one, with the last one blank. 
---
That makes it SUPER easy for everyone to target correctly.
---
Oh, no worries man! I took a screen shot, you evolved the meme and did it with your phone! I wasn’t being sarcastic, I actually thought it was genuinely funny =)

put a show on my second monitor and stare right through it at the wall imagining myself frolicking through azeroth without a care in the world.

That's a lie. Horde have no honor in Classic. Thrall came back, but the honor did not. Saying this as a 12+ year Horde player.

I didn't realized only lowbies rode boats.

Trying to level a warrior on a PvP server. I'm using 2her.... Should I go Arms or Fury to level?
---
Not getting this, but I'm in Ironforge and I cannot see any player or NPC so something must be going on....
---
* Take advantage of the Harvest Festival going on right now. It's outside Org/IF, a huge table surrounded by ghosts. You can get 20 stacks of fruit, drink, meat, and fish. Free pet food!
---
* Go Beast Master for lvling, your pet will be a tanky fucker regardless of what pet you get. I've got Humar and he can tank 2+ mobs a few levels above him solo as BM.
---
* Unlock your second stable slot asap so you can store your main pet when out taming other pets for skills. That third slot can wait for lvl 60 as it's easier to keep one pet within level of you.
---
* Check the Classic Petopia site and keep your pet skills up to date! Far easier and more beneficial to learn new abilities to teach your main pet.
---
* Use that leather working to your advantage and make yourself a new ammo pouch/quiver as soon as you're in level range for them.
---
* Always stack extra ammo. **Always**. You can free up bag space by putting the yet-to-be-used ammo in the ammo pouch while doing instances or lvling.
---
* lvling fishing is your friend if you pick a pet that eats fish, it's free food!
---
Wow never knew
---
oh sorry not up to date on my airline lore lol
---
It’s fun, but it’s not the instant murder you’re seeing in most videos. Nobody shows the clips where you have one more hit to kill a mob and you get a regular (no crit) windfury that is all overkill. 
---
I like burstiness, so it’s still fun for me, but it’s not the god spell people make it out to be.
---
Rolled hunter for first time hoping to get a taste of the class in vanilla form and everything that makes the class what it is in pvp is broke hahaha fuck me.

wait till you see the dog shit shaman healer running with rockbiter and using earthshock on pull.

Shaman tier past t1 is great

I don't have one, but the one that I'm using is the one from twitch client

Mages have some very easy farms for instance on private servers after it was nerfed to make it so you made less money then following retail I was averaging 65 gold an hour. I have a friend doing the exact farm right now. Back on an EU server and they're making 75 plus

LOL? I constructively pointed out flaws in your argument and provided counter examples multiple times. And the best you can do is personally insult me.
---
\^This, this right here should be top comment. Probably looking at closer to 6 months for it to stabilize completely. Right now is when you farm gold right out of the game system to make money. Research what will be worth a ton later, buy it for cheap and horde it. Honestly at this point, if you can get more than vendor price for your item(s) your winning.
---
adds to the whole faction vs faction world they set up. Like for fucks sake why make WoW the way it is and dumb down every little grief
---
I feel like a priest and 4 mages or 3 mages/1 warlock would be way better. No need for hunter snares when you have mage CC and block pulls or eye of kilrog

On horde you can get away without the 1 point in nature's grasp, mainly because warstomp-&gt; entangling is a very viable way of dealing with something, also 35% base chance on nature's grasp is pretty rng.

its always dwarf hunters i s2g
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, but that's in Naxx yes. The guy above spoke about feral being better or on par with for example rogues up to T3(which is the naxx patch) and you're bringing up naxx logs, in which he seems to agree that the other classes pulls way ahead. 
---
Also Naxx will be out for 1/6 of Classic's planned lifetime.
---
Trinkets
---
"TEEN" rating yes.  Teens aren't supposed to be using foul language.  You must be a teen and don't like what I had to say.
---
"Is it ok to grief" kind of gives away your hand already doesn't it?
---
Sockets were fun, sure.  Not RNG prismatic-only sockets though, like in retail, IMO.
---
I second this! Its been great watching this server grow and feel populated everywhere.
---
Hey guys, this is the first of many weapons I have been testing for proc rates and other fun stuff. With only a 1ppm (3.7-4.3% chance-on-hit), the Skeletal Club's unique proc is sadly almost negligible. However, it does have potential what with spell batching tricks in the level 19 twink bracket.
---
If anyone comes up with proc data on the various unique weapons and armor throughout WoW Classic, feel free to pitch in a screenshot or two so we can finally get some answers on these weapons!
---
Lmao duo’d that quest with my buddy. No decurse... my god it was hell. Thank god he was a lock... I was warrior...
---
Furthermore, in dungeons, you can put a “moon” icon over the mob you want to polymorph, as a signal to the dps not to attack it.
---
Hard disagree. I understand killing someone who fights you or contests something with a 60 or a gang, but camping someone endlessly to ruin their day is just retarded.
---
Do I need engineering?

Thank you for saying that alot better than I

You have said so many wrong things in this thread and keep back peddling and stoop to huurrr wow.  The original post was about a DPS WARRIOR, who is pulling in a dungeon(so not the tank in defensive stance) would drain the healers mana.  You argued, didn't realize about beserker stance(20% more damage taken, not 10%, once again), then say shields are irreverent, which I broke down for you exactly how you were wrong using real numbers, and yet you still argue.  No one, at any point in this thread, said not using a shield would make a healer drain their whole mana pool every fight.   I pointed out the different layers, which aggrigated together, would make the tanking warrior take at least 30% less damage than the dps warrior. The argument is that a DPS warrior(in the dps stance, this part should be obvious) would take far more damage hence mana, to keep alive than the warrior that should be tanking in defensive stance, preferably with a shield to make the healers life that much easier.  You doing something(not even the thing originally being argued about) doesn't make you right.
---
This... im speccing feral cat, i regularly will heal/tank to help the group not wipe. If anyone bitches then ok, i wont heal or help tank anymore.
---
I was asked for 200 level 40 water today, I was 41.

I have a wolf, but I have been been feeding him this free meat all week.  Saves me so much money and I can vendor off the meat drops from mobs.  I’m going to miss this event when it’s over.
---
You're an idiot
---
I laughed hard at this
---
&gt; Haha, yea it's bearable if your attacking one mob. Try doing a dungeon and being at 20+ yards and switching targets while mobs are stacked on top of each other.
---

Protip: if you have the twitch app, download Aux addon for classic. It gives you a slick new AH UI that allows you to sort by buyout price/stack or price/item even.
---
That's just sad.
---
And the lifts. Always a surprise when one gets to the top.
---
It's been a month. This post is so irony Popeye is trying to eat it.
---
There are several aspect of tanking and you basically would have 3 classes meant to be tank (warr, druid, paladin): Just make everyone of them the "best" in a specific area of it. As far as I remember it was already that way:
---
- Warr: Best all round tank
---
- Druid: Best soaking/threat tank (weaker aoe tank)
---
- Paladin: Best aoe tank / not that good single target
---
Now do it again but all by level 19
---
Unfortunately you get meta slave bads who see that the AOE meta is the thing happening and demand that in your group even though they're completely incapable of putting out the damage needed to actually complete the dungeon in that manner.  I've run into that a lot. Lots of dps pulling extra mobs and shit on purpose to try to be like the big boys and just causing clusterfucks and slowing down dungeons like mad.
---
The spirits told him to not waste his time on you.
---
I would hardly say the reason you see a scarcity in tanks is because tanking is difficult - wouldn't you rather think it's because solo-levelling a warrior is difficult?
---
No, you summon them from your bag. It is a physical item that you have to carry around with you.
---
Alliance here and how in the absolute heck do I get to Ashenvale from Dun Morough? Apparently there’s a secret mountain pass to Darkshore? I was following someone around who swore to god they knew where it was but we just got lost and gave up
---
Is there a subreddit dedicated to classicwow but in more of a knowledgeable sense? Wowhead and Classicdb are missing a lot of information and this place seems like 100% memes and not much else.
---
if you don't give MT thunderfury....i don't know what your guild is doing
---
Trust me its not.
---
Dumb question: Why does it matter which side it's skewed towards on pve?
---
Battlegrounds will be shared, and I wasn't under the impression flagging pvp was very common on PvE servers in vanilla.
---
Supposedly a quote from Socrates.
---
I stopped listening to that guy after he said Bubsy 3D sucked.
---
Had one of these today in stocks. I asked 4 different times to let me go in for 5 seconds before they open up on dps as a warrior. No one listened and the heal got sick of trying to keep everyone alive and left. Group fell apart after that
---
dude, human males crafting/opening animation is soooooooo shifty
---
So basically he’s already mastered how to play hunter.
---
We just pretending they weren't all full for the first week now?

I am also a danish on whitemane...

You realize that there is no ninja when everyone rolls need? Which is the default.

Sure that's what I am, not someone that knows they'll use it regardless. Like that's the whole point of the argument anyways, anyone that disagrees with your views must be a child. 
---
Don't let your kid on a game if you don't want the kid seeing things you know happen in the games chat.
---
You're not wrong, they definitely got some *much* needed improvements in TBC that made them decidedly more viable for raiding. One thing that TBC did very right was give major PvE improvements to certain class specs that sorely needed it.
---
Looks great and works well on FF mobile. It's very fast. Most sites are slow and works like shit nowadays. Well done.
---
You can pretty much go shadow to level and still heal dungeons up to 50 and maybe past it
---
Ah yes, it's *my* fault for taking your insult as an insult. The nerve of me! And yes, I downvote douchey people. It's a habit, what can I say. I'm sorry the fake internet points mean so much. I imagine when your greatest accomplishments in life revolve around how you spec your character in a game, fake internet points become a lot more meaningful. 😂 Take it sleazy, Chad. I'm out.
---
Hell yea brother!
---
I love all these posts because the people doing these things aren't likely to be reading the subreddit. 
---
Tell your group what they need to do, if they're dickheads about it leave and get a new group, you're playing tank mate you will have a new group in an instant. 
---
It's honestly wasted breath here we all know it.

Man do I hope you never have an epic drop or a 50g+ twink item drop where you hit greed and everyone else with a brain needs.

I wasn't discussing other kids.  I was indeed referring to American kids.  Am I not allowed to do so without including the rest of the world.  
---
Not sure what Twitch has to do with anything, but it does let me in on your age.  You are young.  No troll here.  Don't assume that I was singling out American kids ( they are a mess ) because I didn't discuss kids of other origins.
---
When I see 1 or more folks killing the same mobs I am, I whisper and/or invite them and ask if they want to group up. 
---
Once you get to doing dungeons just look for folks wanting a low level healer or DPS, depending on what you are going for. Most priests are healers but not all, and until you get to higher levels you can probably do a little of both.

I honestly don't understand.

Eh?

Red is dead. Simple as.

Because every single time an Alliance player ganks me, and loses, the calls 14 of his lvl 60 friends to come AVENGE him

Yeah, I do too and WoW's new questing hurts my head, too much meaningless stimulation.

Hey. If I can't kill you with a single Ambush, what are we even here for?

Things were actually different.  The "cringe" and "edgy" stuff wasn't a fad.  Social culture didn't revolve around the newest meme.

And yes kids were more respectful.  I can only assume you are a kid because why else would my comment have triggered you.

It is the average. If you can beat it, you're the exception to the average. 
---
Good players will ding 60 in 200-240 hours.
---
Exceptional Players who dedicate obsessively are 140-200 hours

Normal players will probably be 24-30 days played since they're often dicking around and having fun.

Not sure what your point is.

---
If you aren’t leveling at a speed leveling pace, I would strongly encourage just doing the professions as you level. Making the gear and enchanting it will go a lot further in your enjoyment of the game than playing for 60. If you were trying to optimize time over enjoyment you wouldnt touch a profession till 60 because of how much easier it is to do at max level. 
---
I hit 60 in the first 10 days with 300/300 herb/alch, it’s just more fun that way imo.
---
This isn't my talent setup, just the generally accepted 30/21 - but you need every point and cant afford to put any outside of feral/resto
---
Ya but what’s with the 45 degree thresher tho
---
Occasionally your heals will pull aggro which is when you fade. If you give the tank a couple of seconds to get threat and you are still always pulling aggro, then that's probably the tank's fault.
---
The increased kills/hr is very significant, most people with scythe money have the money to swing it. The time saved killing everything faster means you get to do more tob runs.
---
Got it. Ninja
---
This is very helpful. Thanks for the advice :)
---
Your level will represent your ability to stealth near mobs around your level. If you are too low compared to the mobs, they will see you when you get close. Also remember sap has a max range, so staying at max range while sapping will help. Be aware that as far as I know, beasts cans detect stealth better than others.
---
I don't know about you but one of my best wpvp memories are from SF where we battled over rare q drops for like 4 hours straight
---
I’m 19
---
I didn’t know my Succubus was a healer. Damn she’s good.
---
How do you know ratio ?
---
Yeah that's it alright, because not sure if you've noticed but Warlocks appear as purple in the UI.
---
Eh there’s a very in-depth video on leveling as a shaman in each tree with either wep combo. I leveled enhance with 2h Rockbiter/ WF until 40, then went ele as it’s much much better according to a shit load of sham players and myself. Flametounge does more damage the slower the weapon, but there’s a math to it. I dig the knowledge these guys have on the class.
---
Here’s the link:
---
https://youtu.be/wp-1np_ZDwQ
---
Tailoring is also good for making bags while leveling. Or you could go herb and alchemy, that can come in handy with some potions in tight situations
---
Later, through talents, you can reduce the chance that sap puts you in combat by 90% (I think).
---
I mean people sweat about viability because it's not viability that matters, it's efficiency.
---
A raid full of meme specs will take significantly longer to do a raid than a raid full of real specs. So it's not about "Can I do this content?" It's about "How much do I need other people to carry my dead weight?"
---
Not sure if Horde's fault or Alliance's for being such wimps.
---
You literally don't understand do you? "Sticking it out" means that half of the guild didn't even get to play for the first 2 weeks due to queue times. We would have been starting about a week ago. 
---
So yes we could have literally not played the game for 2 weeks while the others did. Totally nobody's fault but our own.
---
Now fuck off. It is past your bedtime.
---
Anything that makes you gear at level is fun. Getting the mats for something you will wear for 10 levels is a great feeling. Money is nice if you have plans at 60, but it isn’t the Vanilla experience if I don’t keep my professions at the level I am.
---
Most classes have classic discords. I would suggest checking those out for more in depth discussion about your class.
---
It wasn't that mate. It was more of a hub just like IF or Org where you could spot notable NPCs in the lore and brought back a lot of that class idetinity that the game had lost since classic. I think it was widely received quite well, And one of the better things of the expansion. No point throwing shade at something if you never experienced it yourself directly.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Well, based on the sheer amount of threats i've gotten over this single post blame you.
---
I'm sure some fine people play on PVP servers, but the overwhelming majority are toxic people who will attack you and stalk you online for being 'a pussy who cant take it'
---
I got lucky and it dropped on my first run.  Helped a guildie get it and we got it on the third or fourth try.  OP just had some seriously bad RNG luck.
---
They're still *viable*. They're the only tanks that AREN'T warriors that are. They work well as side tanks, and emergency tanks, they have their place, which is the most important thing, unlike Balance Druids or Survival Hunters
---
Exact reason why I went pve. I'm fine waiting until p3 to pvp
---
This is brilliant.
---
You don't need an expensive upgrade either. You want it.
---
To be fair if you are in a group of a few people and using spirit tap and you don't get the killing blow you don't get the mana regen, I've tired to explain this to groups and they just don't see to know how to give up a killing blow when theres like 2+ other targets they could move to. It even helps for me right now as healer/shadow hybrid spec, in 5 mans I can get it to proc if the group knows what to do can keep downtime low. 
---
But tbh spirit tap in groups can be tough sometimes.
---
Sure, once in a blue moon, this is the standard on PVP servers. 
---
the one in a blue moon is finding someone who isn't a prick
---
Pvp trinket, once honor rewards come out.
---
You need to go to menethil harbor in the wetlands. Start in ironforge. Head out and east through the NE corner tunnels. SW doesn’t have a boat to Kalimdor in classic.

So is loot trading not in the game? I remember seeing a video of a conference with a blizz guy saying that loot trading would be one of the few things they would add, citing the reason that if people accidentally roll need then they could trade the item (within 2 hours). The other day a druid in my group rolled need on a staff which wasn't good for him (not a matter of opinion/saltiness, it was basically useless for him and I didn't need it) and he won it. Turns out he couldn't trade it. So is loot trading not in the game at all? Did Blizz do a U-turn on that?
---
The potential is there. They could literally create the "next" big mmo by creating a new classic timeline. It's a no brainer imo, they have all the assets and infrastructure laid out in terms of core development since the game is already finished. All they need to do is add to it. No way they aren't raising eyebrows at the amount of subscriptions that have been made in the past 2 weeks, both returning players and completely new players.
---
That's just a bot at that point. Nice way 2 get banned
---
Chill dude. I think people just want to know if they are going to cycle expacs or add on like a Classic+ server. People aren't frustrated at a content drought or something.
---
How do I stop monkey quest from loading all the quests randomly?  
---
How do I leave a group when my own frame fades out when not in combat?  
---
How do you personally check out your character info? I don't see that micro menu for you
---
Weak auras
---
It's all good, you're a Hunter.  Eventually, you can solo Princess runs.
---
Iirc, fade drops aggro temporarily and gives a window for your tank to reestablish aggro. You can and will likely still have threat coming out of fade, but generally not enough to pull aggro again.
---
You can call me whatever name you want to call me, my opinion is the opinion of the majority of players and we will happily only roll against 3 other players for the expensive BoE instead of 4. So go ahead and roll greed.
---
for classic?
---
What next they going to patch Distraction from rogues so they cant misdirect people off ledges?
---
The only abilities you should have to see are ones you want to see cooldowns for. If it's keybound, it's memorized.
---
Because all i want is a fair roll, not given the item for free and demanding it because my class is the "correct" one
---
Just play me, I suck at PvP
---
Yeah same thing
---
Paladins in TBC could reliably hit the 102.4% with Holy Shield up, which was fairly constant (100% uptime if you didn't block so many times you ran out of charges)
---
But yeah, in Vanilla Paladin tanks are pretty screwed. Fine in dungeons if they're good, the group knows how to work with them, and they've got enough water + mana pots to keep going... but that's about it.
---
Lol for a second there I thought that was a reference to the infamous multiboxer Sam Deathwalker.
---
Is that an addon? Some addons are buggy
---
It gives 100% exp
---
If it works for you and you've got a guild that supports it, far be it from anyone else to stop you, really.
---
After I thought about it, I can see where, especially after the talent revamp patch, it'd be more feasible, at least (as non-restos don't lose the utility of innervate). The ability to take a crushing and the lack of overall tools concerns me, but if you can run with it? 🤷‍♀️
---
Also after thinking about it, I think I'm a bit salty at the fact that it wasn't even an option pretty much at all on my server in Vanilla. A druid that wanted to tank would have been laughed out of every guild. If you had a heal button, you healed. Period. The end. As was mentioned, though, a lot of info has been gained since then that we didn't really have at the time, which changes things, too.
---
I also have a Surface Book and when I play on it the fan goes absolutely nuts! How loud was it? Now that I type this out maybe I need to switch to the integrated graphics instead of dedicated card when I’m flying. Maybe it would be quieter?
---
It is. OP is an idiot. There isn't a patch. 
---
Barrens isn't contested which is why the guy can't MC people from Ratchet to Booty Bay, but the other way does work. 
---
Just like in vanilla, many people playing classic are clueless.
---
You could pre-apply some lube
---
PSA: If you're a low level warrior, threat is irrelevant unless the mob is hitting the healer. You can do dungeons with basically any random 4 dps and a healer until 40+.
---
The point is still the exact same. They run off of ads.
---
Lupos, no. Rake, yes.
---
Playing Warrior Ruins the Classic Leveling Experience TBH
---
Especially since we cant Hamstring Kite or Strafe Kite anymore thanks to Leeway, and the higher level you get the less XP you're getting per kill. Combine this with the complete lack of self healing, Mobility, or escape, and you've got a recipe for hating your fucking life for 59 Levels.
---
It's really not similar at all to lfg
---
Arms.
---
Probably dont need to minmax much seeing its an alt, id say the utility of having an alchemist to support your main would probably outway any extra dps from the tailoring bonus on an alt.
---
Give your tank plenty of time to gain aggro then use your biggest heal. Don’t shield him unless in emergency and don’t use renew on your tank either ( but can use on everyone else). Use fade if you run into any problems.
---
I find Classicdb.ch is much better than .com
---
Dude why does it feel like every alliance guild I see like 80% gnomes lol
---
Horde all the way up until WoW Classic name day.
---
He compares druid tank to fury prot. Fury prot won't wear a shield a lot of the time and he even says how much armor he has with a shield. Whenever people on here discuss druid tanks they always compare prot warrior to feral druid and point out that druids take more damage and therefore must need more healing. In reality druids also produce a lot more thread than prot warriors and therefore the fights tend to be over quicker. If you compare druid to fury prot they produce about the same amount of threat but warri takes more damage while having more cool downs and fear immunity.
---
I guess my problem with these threads is that people seemed to think that a tanks only responsibility is taking as little damage as possible, when in reality threat generation is just as important. Warriors are better at mitigation, druids are better in threat generation. If you have some good fury dps, a druid tank can be the better choice for a lot of encounters. A prot warri will just limit their damage.
---
I'm more worried about raiding.
---
Not unless Sam Jackson pronounced it Bratt, because there is definitely the short A sound when he says his name.
---
If you were interested in min maxing you would only have one character. It’s an alt, do what is fun.
---
Needed 2 more items for gnomer quest, LFG? Nope. Covert ops mission? Hell yea!
---
You can email feedback@wowhead.com with an example. wowdb.com does not have a classic site so not sure what setup you are after, but if you share a screenshot we can look into it.
---
Looking quickly at a mid-level chain, I see that [Power in Uldaman](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1956/power-in-uldaman) has a "series" listing 5 quests in the right-hand side of quick facts, underneath the difficulty. That equivalent quest isn't on wowdb, but using a live example [Return to Karazhan: Clearing Out the Cobwebs](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/45295-return-to-karazhan-clearing-out-the-cobwebs) I also see it on the right-hand side, under quick facts.
---
I think an issue you might be facing is that as higher-level content wasn't tested on the Classic beta (it ended at level 45) and quest chains on Wowhead rely on user data uploads, some chains might be missing but we are doing daily data pushes to add them as people level up and share data. For example, we just got the [Ras Frostwhisper](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5462/the-dying-ras-frostwhisper) series added yesterday.
---
Nope that would get you banned
---
Naw I Soulstone the tank.
---
Is there a class that has a lot of escapability in pvp? Like easy to get away from fights
---
&gt; Yeah, they blink in close to a hunter because they dont wanna get shot. they frost nova and realize "hey this guy isn't swinging his sword at me? Wtf" they ask one person wtf happened in general chat and they learn. 
---
Or they blink away because they don't want to fight the hunter.
---
Or they don't move because they're range classes (this is, funny enough, what you're so excited for).
---
Or they blink into melee range and stay there because they think it's good enough.
---
Or they walk in and out of the deadzone during the fight and don't notice it.
---
The funniest part is, even if we go with your perfect example where everything goes right and the new player notices it, you haven't proven at all that simply looking this up before going out to pvp wouldn't be the better option.  When did I ever claim that **only** reading up on deadzone would automatically make them masters at exploiting it?  I didn't.  You brought this up.  In fact, your example only gets them to the point of *discovering what a deadzone is*.  They are nowhere near mastering how to exploit it, just as if they read a guide and never put it into practice.
---
If you are new to a game you want to play competitively, there's really no reason to not simply research  the game and meta beforehand so you have an idea of what you're getting into, the game mechanics, and what you should practice to improve (again, I literally never said that practice wasn't important).  Telling noobs to go out completely blind into pvp only helps you because you get to kill them more times until they eventually figure out game mechanics, instead of having an idea from the beginning.  In classic wow this kind of thinking only makes sense in the context of "well when I was figuring out the game I was too stupid to do my homework so now everyone should suffer like I did."
---
&gt; What your saying is like telling an art student what "wet blending" is and handing him paint. 
---
No, what I'm saying is to tell that art student what wet blending is, what a good starter technique is, common mistakes and markers that beginners should look out for and think about, and then letting them practice.  What you're saying is to tell them what wet blending is, hand him/her paint, then laugh at them.
---
&gt; Anyway, I could go on about your misguided ideas on how you think gamers should just cookie cut their way through games, doing what all the streamers and guides tell them to do, not discovering things on their own. I would rather sleep. 
---
Please go ahead with the full night's rest before you begin your rant.  I can tell that lack of sleep is really hurting your cognitive and comprehension abilities.
---
And you should probably read about the thing called "aggro affinity" (e.g. here - https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bif380/a_warriors_guide_to_threat_aggro_and_tanking/)
---
It adds some points to the "tank pulls things" rule.
---
Spoiler alert groups don’t ever want to bring rogues so get used to it.
---
It looks like Waldo found jesus
---
Just had to point out before I read the rest of your post, that cats is in no way catering to people with add. I have add. I hate cata+.
---
Leave us ADD people out of this conversation.
---
I hate Cata+.
---
I love Classic/Vanilla 
---
It's extremely rare I actually get triggered by a comment, but damn if this didn't do the trick.
---
Zul‘Gurub and AQ got tokens as well for their sets.
---
Elvui, will let you do just about anything.
---
Not if u load 5 points into Master of Deception they don't.
---
No I’m far from liberal and I don’t believe there is more than one way to get to heaven. Jesus said that no one comes to the father except through him and you’re not a Christian if you reject Jesus’ teaching. We don’t agree but we can still be friends.
---
Lol Hunters have been doing that since Vanilla.
---
Yeah mistakes that inevitably ruined the game. Great. Sign me up
---
Same and I honestly dont even mind it.
---
yeah just be a horde player and then just get ur zerg goin
---
Sigh OP is wrong. Barrens isn't contested so Ratchet to Booty has most horde non-flagged for PVP. 
---
Booty to Ratchet of course does have people flagged because SV is contested. 
---
This explains everything the OP is generating random hysteria about.
---
Grobbulus
---
Probably druid for instant travel form, entangling roots
---
So if you're already inside in a major city, there's no need to go inside an inn? I can just log off in the armor shop, bank, whatever?
---
Is there any love for balance Druids? I played one till like level 60 over a decade ago when I didnt really understand MMO's and everyone was always confused when I told them I specced the balance tree.
---
Thank you, you're not the only one.
---
Wait, so Orcs and humans can replace them? Are they good at all for orcs and humans?
---
I was nervous about picking warrior since I’ve only occasionally played some retail and never anything pre cata. This is largely because I was worried I wouldn’t have the skill to tank effectively. Now I’ve learned tanking isn’t really *that* hard. The real difficulty comes from keeping AWOL pulls from wiping the group, and it better at that than I expected to be. Tank life is good life. But not always ez life.
---
Wait until you get to stv, then you'll have lots of time to soak it in.
---
thats pretty much the lfg tool that TBC had
---
Isn't some of this a little incorrect? At the very least there wouldn't have been a Northrend while there was also a well of eternity? So at the time of Yogg'Saron's imprisonment wouldn't there still have been a single continent on Azeroth?
---
I was warned in a similar fashion by the guys at Gamestop when I bought my key and discs. That $20 dollars went a long way...
---
Stop.
---
The ultimate battle for loot.
---
Truly an high level end game move there.
---
Blood for the blood god
---
Subtle "catch up mechanics" being installed into WoW so that everyone dings 60 at the same time...
---
People who make names like that are so cringey and weird

So what you're saying is your soon planning on being single
---
negative
---
Hahaha yeah sorry she let u die... over... and over...
---
How does rolling need on a BoE over a BoP negate the need for someone who intends to equip it? The only thing I see it coming down to is trusting that someone is actually going to equip it.  Essentially the attitude is not trusting anyone. That's why we roll need because we don't trust anyone else right? 
---
BoP makes it easier because we can't auction it. It's nothing but an acceptance of greed. So we're only saying why bother because people suck?
---
Did you even read my comment? It’s only used in ToB because everywhere else it demolishes your Gp/hr. I have a scythe on my ironman, I know that game well enough mate.
---
Look at this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d269ai/psa_how_to_switch_from_gnomish_to_goblin_vice/
---
I had like 6 at 30 and easily had 100 by 40 and at 45 I am sitting on another 140 at this point, on top of training skills and buying the mount.  Don't stress too much.
---
Ahhhhhh so a classic, WOW VS Runeacape response. Fuck you kid. Come back withh an actual substantial response.
---
This is how I remember it. Mailbox north, FP opposite.
---
Lf for a like minded warrior
---
That’s a p-server channel. /lfg has been used in retail for as long as I remember.
---
I carry a bit of low level drinks and when they see that they offer water because they dont want to wait too long between pulls.
---
How  do I get it to look like yours? I guess all of mine are hidden now plus it has a background, and shows the zones names and hitting reset doesnt do anything LOL
---
Tell them you are a Purple Mage, works every time.
---
As soon as you get Distraction it becomes a lot more viable to sneak while grinding.
---
Had a druid heal my feral druid kitty speced just fine in stocks. We were pulling 4 mobs at a time and completed it with 0 deaths. 
---
I was actually really surprised how well druids healed cuz I was worried I was gonna be too squishy for them to keep me up. Never really played vanilla so I would gladly have another druid healer that knows what they are doing.
---
you can raid as a restoration druid
---
Its a trap!
---
and add on a  'welcome to classic' imo
---
My buddy and I back in vanilla rolled a warrior and shaman combo named Roach and Clip, went around roasting people with 2h windfury crits. Best times! I think the name game is a fun one.
---
Really holy shit. Horde must be on other places then.
---
*cries in dodge...parry...miss*
---
And uphill both way with no shoes.
---
It only sucks if your speedleveling. Try having fun with stealth. See it as a challenge to get behind mobs before they see you. Watch your Ambush crit for shitloads of damage. Out points into crit talents and camouflage to move faster in stealth. Stack CP talents and pull off massive eviscerates after just a few CP attacks (or just one Ambush with Premed). Have fun jumping out of the shadows. That's the fun of the rogue
---
my non viable spec of warlock
---
Warlocks are the new huntards in my experience. I'm nearing the point that if I were given the option I'd refuse to group in a pug with them.
---
90% the lifetapping bickering they have with me, 10% "Fearing in a dungeon is a good idea"

Big brain right here.
---
Everyone likes ElvUI but I think it ruins the look of classic. I like bartender for moving stuff around, informant to see vendor prices, bagnon because of course, and questie because otherwise I'd be lost all the time.
---
Absolutely stellar. We have huge rp-pvp events like this all the time. It's so fun.
---
But once you do catch them... RIP mage. So yeah...
---
Ists not a bug you were correct in guessing it was layering. Just went to same location you were in for their layer.
---
Ew, flying mounts. No way.
---
Blessing of Freedom is such a beautiful thing.
---
I mean... I'm taking my sweet time as well and I'd love for there to be Classic expansions like BC and Wrath, as well as a RuneScape-type deal where new content is added over time while preserving the level cap, current zones, etc.
---
With no tank and a facepulling rogue? Sure you did, champ. Sure you did
---
Warriors are probably the one class who doesn't really care about the blacksmith trinket due to berserkers rage. I think BiS is PvP trinket + reflectors
---
I’d have done the same thing but damn, I can’t help but feel for the poor soul on the other end of that transaction.
---
Agreed, as a priest I encourage the locks to do this so they're not burning through resources. I just pop a single renew and top them up with another unless the get aggro in the next pull in which case I give them the appropriate attention.
---
I get you , but did you have to compare us to huntards..
---
If it were kingsbloom then you could’ve been poking fun at Asmongold for his stream today.
---
BEAUTIFUL!!
---
Lol, do you think the millions of people that play just have no real responsibilities at all?
---
Congratulations, by suggesting suicide you made this about yourself.
---
The reason is you definitely signed up for this job! And it means you're responsible for the safety of the entire team (not healer! you!). It means you keep the safe pace, you track the healer's mana, you track you rage, you track patrols and dangerously close packs, you learn enemies and mark skulls/CCs, you choose where to take fight. Most of the time damage dealers don't see the situation from this perspective.
---
I understand that often people're just trying to help by pulling additional packs to speed up or starting to deal the damage early on and so on. But most of the time for me it feels like someone is trying to help you with walking by pulling your legs - it doesn't help and just adds chaos (eventually it just slows the whole party). And it annoys when people continue to do it even after you politely asked them to stop it.
---
Why don't you think you could raid as a druid?
---
No of course not. That’s trademark.
---
And then the class order halls got abandoned :(
---
So Sam Jackson made a mistake and nobody caught it I guess. The Character’s name is Brett, but he definitely calls him Brad. *shugs*
---
For mc and ony atm you really dont need to respec from a ns/heart hybrid.
---
Ravager or whirlwind axe?
---
I started the game in Cata. So many quest chains and zones are completely new for me in classic, I love it.
---
Despite there being more xp and gold to be made elsewhere, especially later in the game, i feel like *this* is one of Classics purest forms. 
---
Exploring a concept and playing it out and having fun on the way. Im glad you had a good time, this sounds awesome!
---
They should let you take your pick of tranfering your character over to servers up to whatever xpac you like.
---
I'm new to classic wow but I thought its just common courtesy, the few dungeons I've done everyone basically slams greed unless they actually need the item.
---
Grob has almost a 50/50 perfect split. This battle in particular started with the horde pushing ally out of Xroads, then to Astrannarr, and then back again. It was epic.
---
Right? This will be my rogues name.
---
I just want more memes
---
you can raid as anything. Don't listen to reddit and play how you want. there will always be people to play and do content with.
---
yeah this is what happens when classes aren't homogenized.  try getting anyone to dispel spam you and see what happens to the mage
---
As a gnome rogue...excellent.
---
LOL at the comment. Remember people, 3 gryphons length between you and the next flyer, safety first.
---
No, if he was interested in min maxing he would have atleast 2 lvl 60s right now both with different maxed proffesions
---
Oh no
---
My server had its first MC attempt last night... they couldn't get past the 2nd trash pull lol. Granted there were only like 10-15 60s.
---
So I just got this [Staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7710/lokseys-training-stick) from SM Library. I'm level 31 and I'm thinking of skipping the whirlwind axe because it's tedious.
---
So this staff gives +60 atk power when fighting beasts. Where is an optimal location where I can use this staff to it's best potential?
---
I mostly see warlocks run imps in dungeons, presumably for the health buff. Do you normally use succubus?
---
Trusting image titles on the internet is a dangerous game.
---
I'm struggling to understand.. What part of this is nice? Also, if someone tags while in your group then leaves, you don't get credit? That blows
---
Not to mention those poor night elves in darkshore. They were lying on the beach unconscious for a decade before I showed up at level 10!
---
Mind is blown!
---
It's quite astounding how misinformed this entire message chain is.
---
Whether a boss can deal a crushing blow to you has literally nothing to do with your armor and is only tangentially related to your defense skill. What matters is the amount of mitigation ability you have to push crushing blows off the hit table.
---
The formula for it did not change for TBC where paladins had theorycrafted numbers through which you could become uncrushable by using holy shield - however, during vanilla there isn't a way for a tank to be uncrushable : with the sole exception being warriors. You see, a crushing blow is only possible if the attack is not dodged, parried or BLOCKED - and warriors with the improved shield block can become uncrushable through on cooldown usage of the shield block ability.
---
I won't go into the theorycrafting numbers here because I don't remember them, off the top of my head, but what your need to be looking into is hit tables and how each attack type (normal, crushing, crit or miss) interacts with it.
---
If you aren’t saccing every pull and using shadowburn on cd you aren’t trying hard enough
---
Just rolled Alliance on Kirtonos, how does the population feel so far, do you find you see alot of people?
---
Also apparently fun fact http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Kirtonos theres double the horde on our server lol which hopefully doesnt cause population issues later on
---
Actually there’s a very good point to be made; some mistakes are incorrectible to some people. WoW lost me with Horde paladins. Cross faction class halls is exactly that on steroids.
---
I don't need to say please and thank you or hold open the door for someone. I do it because it's polite.
---
Get help for your autism.

We met entering the cave and, although there was a language barrier, some gestures and pointing made us agree that we both were cool and that we could help each other out. I once froze his pet wolf by accident but a pat and kiss made it all better. I may be a traitor to the alliance but i had a blast. Hope ill meet him again some day!
---
Hmm I have it set to numeric value but the enemy bar shows health as a percentage
---
The ogres in Alterac were also pretty good. I did a whole level and a half off them. Hardly anyone bothered me.
---
How about this?
---
I don't really care at all about being authentically classic. I just want a good game.

I'd venture to say the majority would agree with me if you boil it down.

Download lightshot, it's a really great and simple app for screenshot screen

weird because wouldnt alt right be humans?

I mean ffs the alt right could make a comparison to immigrants and the orcs
---
How exactly do people go about finding these awesome guilds?
---
I just don't buy that the vast majority of people who've come to WoW Classic with zero private server experience are going to be serious, long term players. 
---
I'm not saying this to sound 'elitist' or that this is everyone, just the majority. The reason being if you were actually serious about Classic and have really wanted to play it why would you not have played it on Nostalrius, Elysium or Kronos etc.? These servers came at a time when Blizzard Classic looked like it was zero chance of happening so people can't really say "oh I was just waiting for this".  
---
I truly think the non private server crowd will mostly disappear over the next 6 months or so, either going back to retail or just dropping off all together. How many posts did we see in lead up about people who hadn't played in a decade and were excited to come home. Do you really think those same people are going to play for years and years? They dropped off last time for a reason.  
---
The people talking about Classic + (new content) are not trying to ruin anyones game now. They are people who don't have the rose tinted goggles on and know what's going to come when Naxx comes out. When that happens, the vast majority of people in this thread arguing against Classic + won't be playing and there does need to be a plan. I personally don't think Burning Crusade should be that plan, Classic isn't about just revisiting some old content like a museum, it's about the fact that it's a competent MMO with social, old school features that are missing completely in today's landscape. 
---
Blizzard have a golden opportunity on their hands to grow the MMO genre instead of reaping the rewards of whales like they do in retail.
---
Because nobody plays it anymore.
---
Yeah I totally get that. I just wonder what his version of the non-nice alternative would have been.
---
I saw a warlock killing a fellow 
---
alliance yesterday. I was about 10 levels above him and got smashed. Probably got 2 hits off.

Was this on Kel'Thuzad? Both names sound really really familiar

There you go chief, not sure how reliable these stats are though
---
They bathe only in free water.
---
No it was a “kill this one mob that’s higher level than you” quest. So you are wrong. Suck it.
---
Lol ok the one just talking about fair ways to talk about loot sharing taking time to make sure everything is clear and outlined?
---
True. Put them on like mythic Kil’jaeden in TOS and maybe they get it After 1500 tries.
---
Avoided it
---
We're simple folk here.  We see a phone pic of someone's screen, we downvote it.
---
The work around was putting the number in a different format.
---
Maybe if humans didn't keep orcs in concentration camps looooong after they knew they weren't under demonic control (and enslaving them obviously means you know they aren't possessed anymore, pick a fucking stance and stick with it)
---
Maybe if humans didn't try to kill their Forsaken family members, who only wanted to love and protect them
---
Maybe if kaldorei didn't kill every troll on sight
---
Maybe if kaldorei didn't ignore their tauren companions in druidism when the centaur came to butcher them
---
Then maybe the Alliance wouldn't deserve it
---
Any solution to this? was it because account had prepaid time bought instead of a sub?
---

If you’re rolling Alliance, Kirtonos is always in need of more alliance since apparently the server is heavly horde http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/Kirtonos

Narga actually makes all of her costumes by hand. She has a store and a paetron and I'm pretty sure she offers the patterns for experienced seamstresses to purchase and make their own costumes from.

Not trying to be that guy, but this is at least the 3rd time I've seen this repost :p
---
Arms axe spec with some after 40 points in fury crit chance?
---
Some of it is. Some of it doesn't know what the fuck it's doing, looking at you thorns, but I think the AQ set is real good, and reduces stuff like Regrowth cast time.
---
Honestly windfury isnt very cool. Bc windfury is cool because of the visual. But vanilla winfury looks just like a normal hit with 3 damage values.
---
The stone buff gives me a lot higher damage values with each hit killing mobs much faster.
---
You joke about that, but I've had a mage fireball an elite twice before I even saw him, ran away from me while I tried to regain aggro, then someone tried complaining that I sucked at tanking.
---

I followed the steps for lutris but when I run sudo gamemoded -s I get the following:

    Furthermore the command systemctl --user status gamemoded returns: 
---
I'm running Arch. Can anyone help? The game runs but performance sucks. My frames drop from 450 on Windows to just over a hundred but even at 100 the game is stuttering and not smooth at all.
---
You should roll a mage, yea you have to drink.. but mobs just die.
---
One problem is also that they have season-ifyed WoW heaps since classic. In retail, one patch comes out and you've basically been hard reset. Your gear is simply not good anymore. It's the same experience you had going from vanilla to TBC except for every patch, you find a world quest item and it's likely better than something in your gear.
---
For an expansion this is fine but I think current retail is a bit too much of a world of chorecraft for your investments 1 patch ago to count for nothing. And you have to keep the grind up constantly or else you fall behind or miss out(weekly rewards, artifact power). In Classic you can take a break from shit for a month and if your char is in top condition it'll still be pretty great unless a new expansion is out. I think the modern model suits the top players much more since they're the only one able to keep up patch after patch. So the argument that they've only catered to the bottom 40% is not always true I think. Just because a casual guy can get lucky on the loot casino in LFR doesn't mean the game is fully catering to them. They will never see Mythic raiding anyway. 
---
Notice here that I agree with you that skipping tiers is a problem, but I kinda think this caters to top players more in some aspects.
---
Just because you don't need to grind consumables doesn't mean you don't need to be super active. The top players in retail do other things that are about as time consuming as farming mats, if not more time consuming. Spamming m+, hc runs with alts in case their main gets nerfed and shit. Sometimes even pvp because they need a bis trinket, or possibly the other way around if they're top pvp players, that they force themselves to raid cause some broken fucking trinket for tanks drops there that makes them unkillable in pvp.
---
There’s a spell called drain soul. Its icon is blue. When fighting an enemy of similar level, cast drain soul when enemy is down to 5-15% health. When the enemy dies while draining, you receive one soul shard. 
---
I love to use voidwalker to tank during questing. 
---
I like using imp in dungeon for the health buff. 
---
I like using felhunter in pvp (level 30)
---
Hey man, I eat alliance for breakfast with my beautiful mortal strikes
---
Swiftmend is fine for Dungeon healing, but yeah, for raids you're gonna wanna do the Regrowth build with the Balance proc.
---
U legit fucking got me. It took me too long to put that all together.
---
Release TBC like classic was released (separate client), but allow players to migrate their main characters from classic or stay in classic.
---
**SAMITARIAN**
---
**LEAVE ME BE**
---
- jews probably
---
So people aren't allowed to discuss things now? Okay let's remove this post guys and shut down the reedit.
---
So let me put something in perspective, if you don't have any discussion on wither you want classic+ or next expansions, and classic continues to be popular.
---
THEY WILL make BC/Wotlk servers, if they decide to not make classic+. 
---
(assuming classic continues to be popular)
---
Why? They said so themselves most of the leg work is done, it would be a lot easier for them to make BC/Wotlk servers than classic+. As a business entity, if you can make decent money/reengage a section of your massive player base through minimal effort, they will do it.
---
&gt;and efficiency is essentially what chasing parses is about.
---
Well no.
---
Efficiency means I can run MC and BWL in one night instead of spending 4 hours in mc because we have 5 shadow priests, 4 ret pallies, 2 boomkins, and 6 enhance shamans.
---
I just got an Illusionary Rod from SM Lib. It was the groups second run, and everyone greeted the first one. I asked before I needed.
---
?
---
Mt is Mt
---
You’re rolling Priest and wanting to heal? You’re going to make friends super easy
---
Hell yea, brother. So many Ally I meet are cool as shit, and they ever manage to gank me it would only make me respect them more. Strength and honor!
---
So, I can solo SM gy at 36?
---
Or in my case just someone who spends every free waking hour on my computer.
---
Man I should have picked another class.
---
Cries in getting ganked by people few levels lower than me.
---
Rogue leveling is one of the easiest in the game
---
So you are the person who took my name Jo
---
I haven't seen anyone point this out yet, one of your friends has a character named "Knotmedaddy" That's a quality friend right there!
---
Dude who the flying fuck cares. It's a shitty staff that's not even good for twinks on horde.
---
Ravager for spellcleave dps tank warri in dungeons.
---
Whirlwind for leveling. The proc is often wasted and not reliable here. Also no dodge no parry while in proc. So more dmg without a healer.
---
You're a prick?
---
Undead can be priests but not paladins. *laughs*
---
I tell people who run away from me my job is to keep the healer alive. Also, taunt is melee range.
---
he means december
---
for single target damage wouldn't the strength on ww be better?
---
I know spin2win is fun but not exactly reliable.
---
Just got my second Cruel Barb, feels so good.
---
You can disable it in options so people can not invite you to channels.
---
I did just do arm with a lock who used VW like this, I'd mark skull and x and then vw would take the unmarked mob. Was chill
---
Good, be gone ninja
---
Sweet, thanks for all your input! So far I am running it well 30-40 I think is great IMO and thats with High textures, 16x filter, Lighting good, low shadows, low water, high particle and 10 in both terrain detail and foliage (Foliage is my favorite detail for some reason, makes it more immersive) I am sure for raids I will need to turn my settings down but thats fine.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php
---
Attack speeds vary. Other than that, no difference between pets of the same type.
---
The problem isn't entirely the mana efficiency. It has a lot to do with mana cap in dungeons. Fights don't go long enough to rely on regen. Any points of mana I pump into the WL is now not available to heal if the pull goes bad. This increases the chance I need to spend money on pots, or in a wipe case people will ask me to pop an ankh.
---
I'm not really cool with that, especially when LT+shadowbolt's dps is so trash due to the wasted globals compared to just wanding.
---
you can auto decline in social settings, but the info still pops up in chat, but you don't get a pop up like this.
---
it fucking sucks

a lot of diseases are massively oppressive. which can be a good thing for the RPG element... but theres no easily accessible way to cleanse diseases on demand like how there is through first aid with poisons. there are jungle remedys but again, not easily accessible.

This is it^ OR he thought if he accepted rez it would rez him at top of lift when its already heading down and he would die again anyway.

"No player named fuck exists."

I aim to entertain haha. Nah, but for real, it's just reddit. I'm sure if it were in person I'd call him a dick and then buy him a beer or something. He's probably not half as douchey as his comments make me believe. I know I'm not! Lol
---
that would explain it, i dont have drain soul just yet

...nobody mentioned ilvl
---
There's a massive world of difference between "oh muh god minmax" and completely useless/garbage set bonuses.
---
Your first dungeon run is usually what takes it to the next level. So many activities!!! Glad you’re on board!
---
A BoE item is not an item, a BoE represent the gold that can acquired from selling the item, if you truly need the item. Then you'd be perfectly willing to pay the price for it, right?
---
So split the gold with the group.
---
You *wouldn't* spend the gold to get the item you say? Then how can you justify needing it?
---
Paladin, not warrior. I could have used Blessing of Protection to get threat back on me, but it'd be a better lesson for the mage to watch him die.
---
Wow that's pretty beast xo an  hour
---
Got it the 12th time bro good luck
---
Yup
---
5 points into MoD or 5 points into damage, what do you think is more efficient? Not saying it’s wrong at all, but the discussion was about how an efficient leveling rogue is played.
---
It’s polite to spend all of my time giving all my stuff to others? Is it kind? Sure. Is it required? Not in the slightest. I play for my enjoyment. 
---
Your etiquette is not the same as others etiquette, and everyone has different standards. I like to keep things the most fair for all involved where it seems you prefer to reward people for existing. 
---
Thanks for assuming I have autism though. It’s very possible but in no way affects this conversation. Good job with making yourself seem like a judge mental prick.
---
That's the benefit of taking on the responsibility of forming the group.
---
My lazy rogue ass isn't doing that so I guess I just gotta wait for a group that wants a rogue.
---
maybbe ur just noob
---
Here I am dying to basilisks in STV.
---
The worst part is when you find a mine on the side of a cliff you can’t manage to get to.
---
Because you’re in Horde territory.
---
&gt; The only thing I see it coming down to is trusting that someone is actually going to equip it. Essentially the attitude is not trusting anyone. That's why we roll need because we don't trust anyone else right? 
---
Okay, I see where the misunderstanding is now.  I am *not saying roll need on BoE because people suck*.  I am (and some other commentators on this thread) are saying that the worth gained by the massive amount of gold the BoE item can sell for outweighs the item worth of equipping it on a character that will eventually replace it as leveling continues. 
---
I'll quote myself regarding this.
---
&gt; Tbh, even if the BoE it is a technical upgrade, you should sell it unless you're gearing a twink.
---
Maybe they do it on purpose so that they aren't on the same quests as you and therefore have less competition
---
I loved the founding of Durotar mini campaign!
---
The thing you're asking for has a name, and it's called The Burning Crusade.
---
It's fine. I'm sure the priest cast half a shadow blast and pulled it off of him for all eternity.
---
Ravager for group content, WW axe for solo questing.
---
Agreed. 
---
I’ve had one bad experience so far, and it happened last night. Joined a group for SM cathedral to just get the main quest done. I’m a warrior and they needed DPS so I just joined as that (I usually tank). The actual tank is also a warrior while the party leader is a priest ( our healer). First thing he says is to the tank and says he has him covered on loot (no doubt since I joined he wanted to guarantee the tank any drops). I saw this as a red flag but told him I wasn’t concerned on loot all that much. I should have clarified as this ended up being my mistake. 
---
Anyway, we finish the dungeon and Mograine drops his shield. I noticed our tank already has it so I asked the tank if he minded if I rolled on it. Perhaps I should have asked the whole group, but the other 3 members were cloth users. He says he doesn’t mind, so i selected need while everyone except the priest passed. As soon as I selected need the priest freaked out and said I was using a 2her and wasn’t tanking. I said that’s correct and that I do tank when I am needed to tank. 
---
At this point he asked me to tank more runs as our original tank had to leave. I wasn’t up for that, definitely not with this guy, so I said I couldn’t. Once I said that he rolled need on the shield, luckily I still won it. 
---
Wanted to call him out on it but just left and put him on ignore. Ultimately I could have clarified at the beginning I would defer to the tank on drops and would roll anything he didn’t want or need, but I feel like that should be common sense especially with the makeup of the group.
---
One of my favorite things about Classic/Vanilla I'm going to remember your name and be extremely spiteful/petty.  So glad asshole moves have repercussions again.
---
Bag was already open. And clearly she didn't understand what the pop up meant. I'm not here to impress anybody and text posts don't count towards account karma so I'm not sure why you think I'd lie. Not worried about it though. Happy grinding my man.
---
Turning his back on Judaism, smh
---
But ignoring someone takes no time at all.
---
I've got 15+ as an enh sham
---
Fuck, you got me. Further research proves you right.
---
Agree with everything except your rogue assessment - I was under the impression that rogue dps was second only to fury warriors, with mage trailing closely behind. Is that not the case?
---
If youll never pay for water stop asking for it, players aren't your personal vending machine
---
Has this increased
---
I always dream of this happening with my old Wrath Raid Friends
---
2.75 for all of those? Damn that a good deal
---
woo!
---
What’s layering?
---
Mages are in groups to deal damage, healers are in groups to heal.
---
Mages are not in groups for the purpose of vending water
---
I would gold you if I could
---
Loot trading is only available in instances that have a raid lockout.
---
My brother didn't save the link and said he would look for it tomorrow. :/ If he gets it to me ill message it here and in a pm. Sorry.
---
yes it does. Look at what I replied to, you goon.
---
He said: Dps warrior tanking 4 mobs = healer is at 0 Mana by the end of the pull.
---
I said: This has not even been remotely close to my experience with the game, but ok
---
He said: Well go pull troggs in ulda in zerker stance with a 2 hander and see.
---
I overlooked the berserker stance because I didn't personally use berserker stance to tank troggs, but I acknowledge his guy must have. 
---
SO WHEN I SAID 10% dmg, I meant TEN PERCENT MORE DAMAGE THAN I TOOK WHEN I TANKED THOSE TROGGS IN BATTLE STACE.  You still with me?
---
So yeah, at this point, shields haven't entered the conversation because they are irrelevant to the discussion. 
---
I didnt drain my healer's whole mana bar and i still wouldn't have if I'd been in zerker. IDK what this guy is talking about because its just not that hard, and not that much of a difference
---
Still doesn't explain how she knew which item it was in your bag and how to equip it. It just sounds fishy. You clearly are worried about it enough to reply to me.
---
No u
---
Don't have a link on me but the 50 quests aren't in right now and won't be until later.  I felt just as disappointed when I hit 50 on my rogue and heard the news.
---
I actually had to go back and check, Spriests weren't even that good for raid utility in Classic. The only thing they brought to the table was a debuff that increased Shadow damage taken by 15%.
---
It wasn't until TBC that they became the mana batteries that they were known for.
---
This is why I'm combat daggers. I'm 2% DPS under a combat swords rogue with more DPS than me, but i can utterly trash on anyone in a duel. Can't say the same for combat swords.
---
\#nochanges
---
I see you chose the games spot from the opening cinematic. That spot is like home.
---
Here's me, telling myself I'm gonna farm the charms up as early as possible.
---
Here's me also, neglecting to do so until it was far easier to just get the SM quest and the superior 2h axe it rewards
---
👌🏻
---
Far better community aspect than retail
---
Honestly I just found my own groups as a warlock. I advertise in looking for group but then I just /mage 33-38 and whisper a "Hey want to aoe dps some SM runs?". Takes me about 3 minutes to get DPS, and then 4 minutes to get a tank and a healer. A lot of people aren't in looking for group but they're more than willing to do dungeons if directly asked. 
---
This beats having to ask to get in other groups for me
---
DRUIDS.
---
I’ll downvote myself for not thinking of you simple folk.
---
Spell knockback is something that happens for all casting classes. This is why mages are so powerful because they can root all of their targets in place and AOE them down from a safe distance.
---
If you want to fight groups of mobs then maybe doing it in bear form is the optimal move, but I haven't played much druid myself in classic wow.
---
Absolutely. If a recipe that auctions for 200G drops then everyone gets equal value from it. Alchemists save 200G from not having to buy it and everyone else makes 200G from selling it. Everyone can use it as well as anyone else.
---
Holy crap according to this data my server is 2:1 (60k Horde to 30k Alliance). Anywhere you go, you are (factually) outnumbered 2:1. Makes me just want to join to club and roll Horde like the rest of you guys :)
---
The felsteed doesn't do this either and the kodos are completely silent, not even a fall from height sound.
---
&gt;yea but I dont want my character deleted?
---
Well it didn't exist on the new server - so that's what we're talkin about.
---
If it doesn't exist you can think of it as being deleted.
---
And that's what we're talking about.
---
Joking aside, I have been surprised to find how meditative the pace of the game can be.  Slowing down the dopamine hits for minutes at a time while you run between locations.  Having to stop and plan how I'm going to attack a group of mobs.  
---
I never really appreciated it back in the day but now I find it very relaxing.
---
Are you really surprised people who don't tank have no idea how tanking works?  Glad I have a guild that specifically wanted me to play a bear for tanking.
---
You are a literal retard
---
Tauren male animation is the best.
---
“Lol, one second while I stir this ore into bars.”
---
This guy Classics.
---
found what ill be saying:  You (Horde) say ð f € ƒ ð j a ‚ c f I I € c ™ ‚ f I ◃ ð f € ð € € c ™ ‚ f I j c € c ™ ‚ f I Ÿ f ™ € € ð and Alliance will read i a m k i n g t o a l l m o r t a l z i a m i m m o r t a l n o m o r t a l h a r m m i
---
150-300g seems to fit that bill but okay
---
Laughs in level 40+ mount
---
There’s a few good combinations for warlocks, it’s all about how much money you’re willing to sink:
---
Alchemy + herbalism (can sell herbs for money, make potions for questing and dungeons) 
---
Enchanting + tailoring (tailoring offers so awesome gear at 60 before you start raiding; enchanting is expensive but not as many enchanters out there) 
---
Mining + engineering (engineers can make some neat gadgets for pvp, make money off of mining) 
---
Skinning + herbalism (pure profit)
---
/r/all here
---
What is happening
---
Played horde for 15 years.  I know the schtick.  Playing Ally because my friends are.  Pretty sure none of them camping an instance care about the lore enough for that to be their reason.
---
For sure, I just finished a run and they were advertising.
---
But did you go looking for her on your own or did you sully the experience of ''/1 where's Mankrik's wife?'' by using some quest helper?
---
Thank you. That's what it was. Maybe I was remembering it differently from my experience on private serves.
---
Clearly I cared. Not sure why you'd come here and shit on that. I'm sure you're a pleasure to be around.
---
Yeah like why are you here...? lol
---
Yeah those dudes on the Pally discord have been going nuts, turns out the datamine was right and the reflective damage buff scales 100% with +spelldam but only a few guys have it so we still don't know the proc rate. Thankfully Reckoning is completely busted too with all the new spellbatching tricks giving Paladins a million free attacks, so it should revolutionize Paladin tanking as we know it. I'll put out a video when we get hard data on it (especially the proc rate).
---
If I were you, I would recommend tailoring until you make your 60 gear. Then switch to engineering once you have a good amount of money saved up, because it’ll be expensive
---
That's a strange kind of gate-keeping. "People who really wanted it would seek out potentially scuffed/"illegal"/unstable private servers to get the experience sooner"
---
Like yeah I know the Nostalrius team did a great job and that server wasn't scuffed, that's beside my point. A lot of people only trust official things to be long-lasting. A lot of people that now want it didn't think about it much before, but have since the announcement been discovering that they're really into it.
---
I was about to say the same.
---
Northrend could be used to describe the northern region of old Kalimdor. Maybe it actually had a different name at the time, but who cares, practically? Same landmass, in the end.
---
Why not click a guard? They give directions to everything :d
---
Considering how many people seem to hate their last world rework, do you think there’s any appetite at Blizzard to do it again?
---
BoEs are always roll need for everyone
---
No if, ands or butts
---
The Emerald Dream after Classic would be sweet.
---
Shit I hope I don't make things confusing by accident. Named my Orc Hunter Bork and my pet boar Boark.
---
You misspelled paladin.
---
I mean all dungeons except magisters terrace perhaps? Needed you to get rep and keys with Some dungeons like hellfire citadel hade completely new loot tables. 
---
Either you have normal only which you farm to be raid ready. Or normal and heroic Which drops different things, allow easier transition into raids. In the end We all grind the dungeons till raid ready, isn’t HC just making it more refreshing?
---
Lol! In more ways than 1 :)
---
The class halls were actually really cool. I understand not wanting to work together with the enemy faction, but uhh, at least the "halls" themselves had (mostly) cool designs, and some good questlines.
---
TBC, Wrath, Cata... earlier expansions.
---
My understanding is that +Weapon Skill is actually pretty valuable, just not at this level and +1 isn’t really here nor there. But Edgemasters Gauntlets (someone correct me on name p sure it’s wrong) is considered BiS for quite a few classes, namely warriors, and it’s just +7 Weapon Skill to bladed weapons.
---
How do I survive PvP encounters/ganks as a priest? I'm a new player and have no idea what most of the other class skills do to me. I feel like die instantly.
---
Edgemasters without question...
---
I'm not talking about dps here. I also don't know, it probably varies from phase to phase. I'm talking about "best classes in vanilla" tier lists that every youtuber/influencer/streamer/guide-writer makes these days about literally anything new or old or whatever. A lot of people follow those like religion and don't think for themselves. But these lists don't just talk about dps output.
---
I won't discredit the knowledge of those players, but it's kinda dumbing down the choice process a bit imo.
---
People see the argument these tierlist makers make about mages - Best in pvp overall(according to claims), best aoe, great in dungeons, teleports and free food/water. Easy and efficient aoe leveling. Great single target damage. 
---
People see arguments for warriors - Best scaling dps, best tanks, best group pvp dps, unstoppable juggernauts that literally body people with just little support. Hardest/slowest/tedious leveling(which means skill check to many).
---
Priest - Best healer, everyone wants one, awesome 1v1 as shadow, good levelers, will always find groups, etc etc. 
---
Hunter - best low-effort solo leveler. Decent in 1v1 and group pvp. Passable dps. Lone wolf playstyle very possible. It's the "casual class" for people that just want a good time, which is why it tops many lists.
---
Rogues are also popular of course and they do great single taget dps. Their 1v1 pvp value is awesome. But they're more gear dependent than mages and don't offer much utility in groups, they share gear with heaps of others too. I'm not discrediting rogues but they don't get as much attention as power houses as mages do in these lists and are often described as requiring a hardcore player to pilot.
---
I LOVED weekend wow back then playing drunk was a highlight, it's kinda like playing pool drunk you really do become a PvP god, at least that's what it looked like on my screen
---
30/0/21 Ele/Resto shaman is pvp viable and enough resto to be taken into raids without respec.
---
All my friends say that ele shaman is the best controlled burst in the game. Boomkin are effectively just a weaker ele shaman.
---
Switching to a melee cleave group. 
---
3 ravager warrs, 1 shaman, 1 priest. 
---
Very similar clear time but generally requires higher levels than spell cleave
---
Theres 1 set of edgemasters on my server and they are on the AH for 2k.
---
Honestly, at 48 hours played you should be closer to level 35.
---
Maybe review your route and questing zones?
---
Love it. Jay/Draethorn, you out there bro? It's Accidentt!
---
Oh man anyone else a class racist? I am level 32 and have never let a hunter in my group for a dungeon yet. I have turned away so many and I always tell them its because they are a hunter.
---
Aye, it's sweet when people play well haha. Healer's got aggro? Concussive shot, manual pet taunt, send my pet back to the other mobs with that mob chasing behind, throw out a fat multishot. Feels good man. I've healed, tanked, dpsed, so it doesn't matter what class I play, I have my eye on the overall situation and do whatever needs to be done. Imo, this is what distinguishes people worth playing with
---
Well excuuuuuuuuse me princess for wanting to get cheap bags and wands to the low level players that need them
---
Azshara is a level ~50 zone.
---
retail shills everywhere.
---
there is a reason we don't play that game and it's because it sucks.
---
No loot!? Devastating!!
---
Kurinaxx?
---
Not great, but that's playable. I played on US realms from Iraq on satellite a decade ago and got 1200ms which was bearable if you didn't PvP and just spammed your rota and hoped for the best.
---
Did someone say, Thunderfury, Blessed Baked of the Windseeker?
---
any luck?
---
Have you tried Ashenvale?
---
Forehead, meet brick wall
---
I was hoping for one of these moments.
---
Shit post
---
Was questing in Desolace one time, Druid came by and removed a poison that had 30 sec left on it...but didn’t buff me... I’m a warrior btw. I literally facepalmed
---
I wish this was true! I was farming the thundering charms (hardest elemental btw) this morning,  saw 2 Orc warriors doing the same and we left each other alone. They finished, then a Tauren came along to do it (even though he was level 41 already, 4 levels higher than me) and kept attacking me on sight. So we just kept killing each other when the other was low from fighting elementals and the graveyard was right next to it, it was annoyingly pointless.
---
We were this close to greatness
---
So basicaly you just met some retards and think whole class is being played by retards. Makes sense
---
Ah yea I’m 5/5 in tactical mastery so I just make sure I’m 30 rage or less before I dance
---
Haha thanks! It's the thought that counts 😉
---
If your hinge does 180° you can stand it up to eyelevel and hover your hand over the sideways keyboard. I did this on a flight and my seatmate looked at me crazy, but it worked.
---
So strong /flex
---
Honestly, you’re right. It’s not hard. But it is hard to level a warrior and it is high stress to tank a dungeon. People are demanding and rude. They expect a lot out of you and it’s harder to hide your mistakes. For instance, a DPS can be complete garbage that does less damage than the healer wanding - but no one will day anything. People don’t like tanking pick up groups beaches players are mean and rude and demanding.
---
HELL YEAH BROTHER. FOR THE HORDE!
---
Adorable
---
No read it wrong. Sorry.
---
This is what peak performance looks like.
---
You just have drain soul if you have healthstones as they're both learned at level 10.
---
Not at the level it was being done at now. I never saw people doing this on private servers. I just feel something is a little off with all that. Blizzard already confirmed demo shout was bugged im  sure there are other things that need tuning still.
---
That’s a poop knife.
---
&gt; I was able to MC people going from **Ratchet to Booty Bay**, but not Booty Bay to Ratchet.
---
As a healer, I’ll choose a mage over a lock to fill a dps spot any day. 
---
Not only do they give you free water, which saves you a lot of money, but they also have cc that can’t accidentally pull a huge pack to wipe the group, their aoe slows mobs and doesn’t hurt the person casting it to further drain your mana, they don’t have a pet to accidentally leave on aggressive to pull entire dungeons, and they can make you a portal after the dungeon is over so you can save your hearthstone cd. 
---
The only thing locks do is give soulstones.
---
Polymorph is essential in dungeons! 
---
Also a way to be a bro to opposing factions as it heals them.
---
Nat is living every alcoholics dream, go back 15 years and do all that drinking again
---
OP, you're a sweetheart and you both deserve each other. 
---
I feel your pain about the BoE firsthand (my wife is wonderful but clueless about video games, and was kind enough to try wow with me years ago.)
---
Here's to many more years of not telling her that she ruined your fantasy economy!
---
Guys hear me out. I was at a dm run where every single piece of defias piece dropped. No one could believe it. We told that rogue not to leave his house because he used up all his luck in life.
---
and there are plenty of explanations for Night Elf mages. You heard of Dire Maul?
---
Exactly
---
Just invite people working on the same quest as you. There are plenty of times where you will both be waiting to kill a named mob anyway.
---
As a priest, you have an easy time getting instance groups. Start by finding a tank and then fill in the dps. Tanks make great questing friends too. Warriors can kill non stop with a pocket healer.
---
Your go to leveling spec is shadow and that keeps you self sufficient
---
It's because people have fuzzy memories and think this game is hard. 
---
It's not
---
Are you sure you don’t have that backwards? Barrens is a horde zone and if they aren’t flagged for pvp you can’t do it there. Booty bay is fair game.
---
Likewise.
---
Read it again, but slower this time.
---
Boomkin do more dmg in pve as starfire is superior to lightning bolt. Balance in pvp usually never stays in boomyform but rather bear / humanoid form.  Balance have some talents good for resto so you can heal everything perfectly fine.
---
Elem is really mean in pvp, with some crazy burst potential. but for dps in raids they duck quite hard. As bad as enhancement and paladins. In instances anything works. As elemental specced you can heal fine and get your pvp gear through healing.
---
Yeah man, I totally get that these stupid comment fights devolve into petty need to clearly provide your point, but at least now we don't view each other as negatively, so i can explain what I meant with a less emotionally charged lens. 
---
Define:
---
A statement of the exact meaning of a word, especially in a dictionary.
---
1. an exact statement or description of the nature, scope, or meaning of something. (i was intentionally getting you to "define" an already established system, so I could more accurately understand your viewpoint. This is the meaning I was referencing)
---
2. the action or process of defining something. (This was the definition you surmised without realizing this was not what I was intending to convey). 
---
Define possesses 2 abstract meanings of one definition. I didn't misunderstand what you meant, which was why I was simply trying to explain that I didn't say anything incorrect about you, you just assumed 1 of 2 available abstract subsections of the same definition. Ridiculously nuanced argument and i probably shouldn't even attempt to make it on reddit.
---
&gt;I still remember this one guy who claimed he had a bunch of alts, so he pleaded with the party to keep a bunch of the BoE items because he wanted to mail them to his alts. The party didn't want to argue with him, so they passed him a bunch of greens/blues. After the run was over, we all portaled back to town, and the first thing we saw was this guy disenchanting everything in front of the AH, and then posting the enchanting materials.
---
Literally none of the conclusions you draw from any of this are things that I disagree with. I just feel that trying to circumvent the natural progression of how the response to this behavior was established in vanilla is inherently not adhering to vanilla philosophy. I disagree with your contention that you think that because a certain conclusion was drawn from a social issue in vanilla in the past, that gives you the authority to unfairly intervene with that process of social hierarchy in Classic. What makes classic classic was the availability of systems that allowed players to police themselves, and by champion need only, you are taking away that vanilla concept. not that need only didn't happen, that you're ignoring a natural progression of social distinction is what made it happen in the best. THAT is why I think my contention is more "vanilla" than what you are saying.
---
Battle groups were in vanilla prior to the patch classic is in, I cant remember which patch. So it is reasonable to think they would be in classic when bgs are release, but idk if it has been explicitly stated.
---
People are so rude and usually the ones who act like this are the same ones causing the problems
---
🤔 realized he would miss his exit if continued casting. I approve.
---
Big tity goth
---
It really fucking needs to be 40yds, which is the max cast distance for casters.
---
Good meme.
---
When people ask me what faction I play, I usually respond with:
---
''Horde, duh'' or ''Horde ofc''
---
I've never been one to change teams; only to make the absolute very best of the team I support.
---
Over the years, I've developed many stigmas and stereotypes of the alliance that I could never come to terms with, playing myself.
---
Alliance, in my opinion, has always been trimmed and neat while horde has been brutish and raw.
---
Kinda like how outside of WoW, when I take my little one trick or treating in the fancy middle-upper class neighborhoods and everyone is out and about gossiping about their neighbor's fundraiser or so and so's participation in the PTA meetings and event planning organization of Stacy's wedding reception while her husband runs for office...
---
Yet when we get back home... we smell the ganja the whole walk up the stairs and hear music blasting throughout the neighborhood rattling the walls of the entire complex with people screaming at each other from one building to another, soliciting drugs or asking for money till 3am with heavy police presence roaming nearby.
---
Horde had always felt real in the sense that no one really gives a shit and those that do are trying too hard.
---
Try not to feel fear of missing out. Most of us feel it.
---
I play on stalagg, which is #3 pop wise. There are about 1000 lv60s between both factions.
---
Put that into perspective. Maybe 2-3% of the active pop is of 60. It seems there are more because those 1000 people are online 12 hours a day or more. They are an overepresented part of the pop.
---
Just gonna pop in to say that druids can very easily tank all of MC. You wont "basically be healing". If you're feral, you get a tank spot
---
Lol just fade out or psychic scream them.
---
Didn't see my first bag drop until level 9...
---
Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
Yeah man seriously, the whole "end game in a week" thing is not something vanilla ever had. Most people spent 3-4 months or more getting to 60 and then another couple months or more gearing up for raids and such. This is not a fast game, even if you're seeing streamers and power levellers charge through the content as fast as humanly possible. 
---
And honestly this whole "OK NOW WHAT" attitude that's risen up in games the last decade or so is infuriating to me. People scream for more content then race to the end of it (rarely fully exploring it) then clamour for me. Slow down, *play the game*, have some fun. Or if you're one of those people who only enjoys speed levelling then accept that you're but a tiny percentage of the player base.
---
Dude if it was anything like castlevania I would be so happy
---
Oh, so you have no idea what you're talking about. Cool.
---
100%! A lot of people dont understand that so much of the rage generation comes from being hit, so when your dps are pulling threat you are just shit out of luck hoping that you’ll have the rage to do something in 2-3 hits, assuming you don’t miss, or the mobs get split 3 ways because of healer threat and no focus targeting...
---
It's like the indian guys in the mall that aggressively try to give you a free sample of lotion
---
Good for you mate. 
---
Tho ive had a few "huntards" (sorrynotsorry) in my grp that dont take growl off.
---
even if we tell them(no threat trouble), and ran out of arrows "12min" in a instance.
---
 Stay strong be the exception for calling hunters huntards, please i beg you :)
---
Glad to hear it
---
Excluding the outside world, I achieve a lot in my underpants at home.
---
Nvidia, maybe others too, has a software that keeps a 10m(adjustable) buffer of video you can save when you’d like
---
smolderweb!
---
The WC set has +2 staves which goes great with the rare staff from a WC quest with good dps on it
---
I have a 2014 Macbook Pro; was $400 off eBay. By itself, it only has Intel integrated graphics, but that's surprisingly great at handling WoW at 50% rendering (1280x800).
---
I have an eGPU for it though and have a RX 580; that has no issue with WoW.
---
They're saying this change happened today. Since you don't know any specifics, how about you wait and see what's going on before basically calling everyone talking about this a moron.
---
Its on smolderweb
---
Paladins are better healers than Priests according some though... 
---
What is it you truly want?
---
How about I just tell you your girlfriend's name: Rebecca. She was an easy one.
---
I was calling the mods jokes not the places that they mod. You absolutely need some moderation in most internet forums but the key is finding a proper balance. Unfortunately the kind of people the position of internet moderator attracts are... less than desirable.
---
I mean, Vanilla WoW was released in China back in like 2005 or 2006.
---
The hero we need! Thx!
---
Too bad about SM, unless your a mage, priest, druid or warrior no one wants you.
---
Just let them die. Fuck it. They'll get the message
---
You don't even need battle.net to run wow...
---
Oh fuck off, this is and was part of the experience. You get ganked, and you gank. You MC and you get MC'd. Circle of grief.
---
Hell yes
---
How? Priests are one of the most mana efficient classes while leveling. He's clearly doing it wrong.
---
Is Grid only for once you hit raids? I'll give shadowed and Prat a try!
---
Super useful thanks!
---
i keep seeing this hit cap but where can i see that stat?
---
Pretty sure I saw the same guild name alliance side on westfall.
---
Anime gunna anime I guess.
---
Questie I'm torn on since it takes a way a bit of the vanilla feel. I just want something that lets me track more than 5 :)
---
starfire can do good damage but youre only really going to get them off on people free casting in AV or maybe rooting a warrior. 3 second cast time, you're not going to have the opportunity to get a starfire off very often without getting interrupted.
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks!
---
My brother and I just started mages together and were mind blow today about this:
---
Were level 19 (and just hit max stack rank so I know I get a new spell rank next level) but the waters I can conjure give me 151 mana over 18 sec and I have 900 mana. It’s actually a joke.
---
Dude, 44 is the mathematical halfway point for total exp needed 1-60. Thats why 1-44 “takes” as long as 44-60 if your efficiency stays the same lol. You do get that right?
---
Any tank can ranged pull.
---
You look like you would be into BDSM
---
Earth Mother guide you.
---
they could have sent a pm stating next time it'll result in a suspension then removed the comment.
---
but really they should just remove all mention of classic and treat it like it's RMT, private server, exploit, etc.
---
Not impressed by a healer vs non healer 1v1
---
Vuhdo looks interesting for the buff tracking alone!
---
Dw, I know what griefing is.
---
This is my view. I think that Retail in the Star that it is/was is what allowed for Classic. I think that Blizzard started to lose money so they did what they thought would make them more money...release Classic WoW, and put it behind a subscription wall.
---
So an instant cast ability wouldn’t get any bonus? Thanks for the info!
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
Especially as orc mirahs song is not that good for an orc compared to other weapons. There are a lot of other weapons fitting better. Also Ironfoe is like getting a binding in mc. ) I would go with flurry :
---
Thats advertising...
---
so for the raffle we did a 40 man raid group.  The item holder then rolled 1-40 with everyone being assigned a number.  For the lotto, we did a 50/50 lows and highs.  people who bet lows go to one staircase, highs to the other.  The GM then rolls and if its over 50 highs win, under 50 lows win.  So and and so forth until theres only 2 left and you roll 1-2!
---
Wish people understood this, I find it hard to get into groups as a Hunter while leveling, and when I do I usually top DPS..
---
you wouldn't be able to cast it all to see the error message if they weren't flagged, it happens at the end of the cast, just doesn't go off and gives the error message
---
What I'm gathering from all the comments in this post is that it really depends on the community within a server how these things go.
---
Back when I used to play Vanilla, our server had its own website that was extremely busy and everyone knew everyone else; in this situation we would all gladly roll Greed when a BoE would drop because of the community factor and not running to run the risk of being labelled a pariah by the rest of the community (Granted not every server community in Vanilla was like this but mine was).
---
As the game progressed with tools like sharding, server groups etc.  Where a ninja from a run would disappear into the ether of one of 6 other servers, the community aspect mattered less and less and as a result players became less connected and more selfish.
---
Nowadays with Classic, which has only been out for the better part of 2-3 weeks, communities are still being built up; anyone who is lvl 45+ where rare blues are dropping are rushing and are either powerlevelers from private servers or have (or have adopted) the retail mindset of getting what's yours in spite of your neighbour.
---
My hope is that as Classic matures, the essence of community will return in some form but 15 years down the line it would be foolish of me to expect things to return to the way that things were.
---
Can confirm. Is poop knife.
---
stop
---
Unsubscribe
---
Pretty sure people didn't like losing their progress when servers were shutdown. The thing that made Classic desirable is not worrying about losing your character.
---
&gt; You are a literal retard
---
Care to actually bring up a point instead of making a fool out of yourself?
---
When I first got this game I played for 40+ hours, dont think because I level slow I'm "unskilled". What do you think will happen when he rushes? He will get overwhelmed, kinda bugger out, and then he MIGHT get to 60, know that one for a fact as well! He should get comfortable because he sounds like a new player.
---
I actually did WC with 2 hunters using pets to tank, one was a little overleveled though. Went fine, no wipes.

---
This was me. 23 mage going to hillsbrad and all the 30+ alliances ganking everyone. I thought i'd be cool with world pvp on a pvp realm but there's so much of it, I'm unable to actually level. And the fact there's no ranking system means its completely pointless too. Made me switch to a normal realm and I haven't looked back since.
---
My experience has been the opposite.
---
Enjoy it, I've been taking it slow and at /played 4 days, I'm not that worried that I'll miss something out.
---
Common strategy is get to 26-27 and spam Stockades, after that SM and after that ZF.
---
Cheers.
---
Just as God intended
---
Time is money, friend
---
That's because they do on most servers, and by a good amount
---
Noob who just transferred to Earthfury, what's the context?
---
but think of the children!
---
I’ve played priest on various occasions through out retail and here’s a few tips:
---
1. Inner Fire is a must, it mitigates a lot of dmg if you face any physical damage class.
---
2. Power Word: Shield, get it up before casting.
---
3. Use fear when it’s off cool down.
---
4. Don’t be afraid to run around a lot, using damage over times and instants to kite when your fear is on cooldown. A melee class in classic hates this as closing a cap is quite hard and they don’t have a lot of self heals for the dots.
---
Maybe reroll on pve server if PvP server is too hard for you :) also ur in horde territory
---
I did it today and it worked fine
---
Elemental shaman.  PvP is about utility and burst damage.  Ele Sham is tier 1 in both.  Grounding Totem, Earthbound Totem, really all the totems, Purge, Earth Shock, Frost Shock, Ghost Wolf, heals, the list goes on.
---
Also, Lightning Bolt + Chain Lightning + Earth Shock is one of the most reliable ways to global someone in the game.  I mean it.  100-0 in one global cool down.
---
And then when you swing you miss and wait another 3 seconds only for the mob to parry.
---
Pally before getting Holy shock that doesn't do engineering and is out of candles.
---
Hit him with the Blok.
---
Not really about being a healer, they easily killable as a mage, he just fucked up. All he had to do was sheep the pally reset the fight and wait out BoF. Pally bubbles you kite until it's off and sheep again and go for gold, CS the heal and it's over.
---
Orgrimmar* and that is because orcs and trolls share the same leveling zone.
---
You need the add-on realmobhealth
---
Noggenfogga*
---
"I can't out heal stupidity"
---
Lmao yoy asked a question and he gave his opinion that you didnt like so he's some tough guy? Retard
---
Imho that little bit of speed up rarely pays off. Like 9/10 of these grps in my expirience make at least 1 wipe and 1 corpse walk making this timesaving complete waste. Risk vs reward doesnt work often that way.
---
But i play a lot with randoms. If you play with guildies all the time i can see how this can be good.
---
Happens to the best of us
---
Apparently all you need is a handful of retards in questing greens.
---
Is this because you set up a list of specific items that you wanted to monitor similar to TSM “Groups”?? I just got auctioneer today and haven’t looked into it much, but if what you were talking about is just something I could look at after a basic scan I’m going to be really happy.
---
Honestly I don't bother with pvp talents when leveling anyway because of I get attacked it's either by someone 5+ levels above me, or a group of 3+ if they're the sameish level. Not often you encounter a fair fight.
---
Damn I should play a Mage
---
I don’t understand the hate for phone screens. It’s so much easier while playing. Take a picture from phone and directly upload it..no tabbing into browser, searching picture on ur pc, uploading it etc. you can stay ingame and as long as you can see what’s on the pic it’s fine. The future is now old man
---
Also an appropriate response. Basically anything but spitting on the kindly mage.
---
That'd be cool. I don't really care what route Blizzard takes with Classic, but I think exploring other races options is interesting!
---
Don’t cast wrath if you get to much knockbacks, moon fire the targets, HoT yourself and go bear form instead.
---
You get swipe and cat form soon, it changes the whole experience. Druid sucks before lvl 20.
---
In levling dungeons it is not much diffrence between a war tank or a war dps. We usally just assing the highest level war as tank. I run all my runs just fine in berseker stance whirlwind/ravanger and stance dancing for  taunt or sweeping strikes.
---
Actually that happens so often to locks that all the frustration was just too much for him i guess.
---
Most of the hybrid classes are faster like druids, shamans etc.
---
But rogue smooth sailing if you know what to prioritize, a lot of new players are misinformed and think that rogues are supposed to be some dagger wielding assassins while levelling.
---
Munchies, crunchies, Lucky dos and loot!
---
Dont believe this fake news, I litterally just tested this and it still works, I am horde btw. So if anything it is just a bug.
---
I use Grid in parties and even solo. Grid just presents the unit frames in a simple manner specific to your needs. For example as a druid I have each HOT presented as a count down timer in each corner of the frame, poison / curse come up as a large icon in the middle. Healbot is a much more popular add on but I never cared to change, grid + clique never failed me.
---
Then again how many times do you shield your warrior/druid tank?  2-3 times in a 6 pull?
---
Before I get angry comments is that then the tanks don't generate enough rage do build up threat.
---
[Now whatcha got big shot?](https://classic.wowhead.com/leveling-guides)
---
Cos with a macro you can set to a mouseover and do it kid fight without losing your current target.
---
You're not making it easy for him by putting it at the bottom of the thread. He will not get a DM for your message to me. If you weren't replying to me he would get a notification.
---
I thought these were two different pictures stacked vertically and was so confused
---
no u
---
Damn lol
---
And the healer likes having mana
---
Of course you could analyze it like that the same way I would have just Hoj him when he tries to poly me. Follow my a bubble out of the next poly. It's always easy to analyze things after a fight.
---
Warlocks also tend to have a "You're not cool and evil enough for us loser".
---
I also love that other NPC's resent you for anything Warlock related. Like if you ask a guard where the local Warlock class trainer is they basically say "Fuck you, also I heard they hang out in the back that weird bar".
---
I'd like to see that happen in MoP/WoD, when they could talent into a really strong fan of knives
---
Ever thought of making a quick tanking rules macro?
---
Dude is just being stubborn, and doesn’t want to submit to an obviously correct hypothetical.

---
Yeah but wanding blows after 45 when Umbral Wand falls off and pretty much nothing replaces it unless you do Maraudon or get the AV wand(later phases) at 51. You can either balance downtime with kill speed or shut your kill speed down to nothing if you don't want to drink at all. Warlocks are zero downtime, especially with first aid.
---
I'd buy the equipment, sit on it r or months and sell for profit
---
i don't use addons. how do i see my spell crit without addons.
---
"classic and nothing more"
---
This is where you are wrong. Sure you want to enjoy classic that's fine take your time leveling. But don't say that we can't have new content or move onto tbc just because you want to focus on the journey. And also this tbc/classic+ thing won't be relevant for a year? Maybe more. Plenty of time to hit Max and for you to gear
---
So you missed all the census info people have been putting out the last week?
---
Rogues are literally the worst solo levelers in the game for horde and only slightly better than pallys on alliance. You couldn’t be more wrong comparing them to hunters and warlocks LOL!
---
Leatrix Plus can give you the dragon border + alot more

You're bragging but you got lucky and that player was just awful. The only way a mage would lose to a pally is cause they wanted to

Never renew/HoT pre-pull, the threat it causes can amount to some fuckery. Also the power word shield thing, but that's been covered well by other comments.

Space goats? Lmao what's next pokemon battles?

The issue is you have to spend 8 days looking for a healer because they're all answering the AOE spam that is drowning out your LFM.

Its hard to comprehend, hence why the position attracts the worst of the internet.

Way too little for what you have to do. If you still want it to be a joke thingy what about 4200 it's 420 with an extra 0 :o
---
I'm not bragging. I'm having fun
---
I get your point, but I don’t think it makes it refreshing. ESPECIALLY in Wrath when you HAD to do one each day lol
---
As a warrior, its frustating to fight something with more movement speed than you (someone with slows or with extra ms). 
---
The only thing you can do is wait until the other player makes a mistake, so you can use intercept and hope that they don't find a way to create space.
---
When I kill somebody in PvP it feels like the other player made a mistake. If I kill somebody using my hunter it feels like I played my class well
---
Questie is the one add-on I feel bad about using.  I totally get that.
---
The ol' number 1
---
You're forgetting the existence of private, it's not mostly a CRT screen issue.
---
Do... do people actually still forget that Google is a thing?
---
I remember when there were rumors about the Dreaenei being a playable class, every kid complained on the forums about not wanting to play as an ugly race. The forums where full of posts about it. I guess blizzard gave their playres what they wanted. 
---
It would have been so cool to play as a real Dreanei. After all this years I'm still salty about those stupid goats, I wanted to play as Gondar so bad.
---
If you know what you're doing, mage. They can kill groups at a time (nova into improved blizzard) and are the quickest to speedrun to 60
---
i liked the lore of it.  i can't say of any games that used a boss to completely change the landmass in a game.
---
Questie exists. Nice drawing though I guess
---
it's just a picture of a cat. go to facebook.
---
This has happened before, I mistakenly pressed release spirit...
---
This is epic. WoW #photography! 😎

Ahh ok. Thanks for the answer.

I got to 40 in those 48 constant hours, I’m level 15 TODAY. You know, when I have a job and family. I also have
---
I wanted to roll druid cat just like I did in Classic, but the stigma and pain I'd face trying to do so just isn't worth it for me this round.
---
"Hi. I'm a priest. Can I join your group?"
---
Ought to work 10/10.
---
Hehe I just saw this. Spent all day in the Hinterlands doing those miserable elite troll quests. :( But at least I have my +attack +hit trinket.
---
The real Draenei, not those stupid blue goats they created for wow.
---
hey thanks! will try it out. 
---
Not sure if you're aware but for currently released version the UI opens automatically when you group with someone. Don't know if this is intended or changed in this new test version. and big GZ, you're on pcgamer: https://www.pcgamer.com/this-cool-wow-classic-addon-lets-you-open-your-own-shop/

I'm not commenting on what I think your leveling speed is, i'm commenting on your OWN OPINION of your leveling speed.
---
&gt;because I level slow

---
BoEs should be need. Everyone NEEDS gold, and equipping a lvl 40 epic instead of selling it is stupid.
---
Yeah my bad. I forgot about the zep in Durotar
---
He said tank
---
Download the addon: CharacterStatsClassic it'll give you the extended character stats such as hit, crit, attack speed, spell power, etc.
---
There is none at this time.
---
He has 50 black lotus' now, how do you feel about the situation?
---
Healing over Time (life dots are damage over time). Regrowth and rejuvenation are HoTs
---
That was Cataclysm.
---
I journey into retail and end up surrounded by idiots.
---
What server you on? Cause in mine they have a lot online the AH like always
---
Generally it depends on the value of the BOE. 
---
For an RFK blue, needing for an upgrade is fair. No one should complain about something worth only a few gold if a party member can use it. If it was an epic for example (purple), I don’t care if you could use it as an upgrade - it’s fair game for everyone.
---
Blizzard is making record money off of retail. Believe me classic was not launched as a cash cow. It truly is a response to the massive outcry from the fans.
---
Who is Stan?
---
Pretty sure the drop rate is 30% IIRC but yeah the farm isn't too bad.
---
Ah well. Brother from another server.
---
You would have to be such a fucking square to take issue with this. I really need to know what happened in the nsfw part.
---
It's named "custom texts".
---
All my this
---
...I'm not a artard... :c
---
Hahaha imagine gatekeepers pixels
---
on Kurinnaxx?? i am Peanutbutter, I complimented Natsu the other day!
---
There's room for both cats and bears in raids. Not trying to take away from your meme, I liked it. I'm just saying.
---
Why because he enjoys fucking with the enemy players? Its world of WARcraft, not SafePlacecraft. I like the constant sense of danger, I chose a pvp world on purpose. If you think mc'ing off the boat is bad, I camped a warlock who killed me while leveling for like 3 hours yesterday, I'm sure he had the 10 minute respawning and eventually just logged off. You're the type that's funnest to camp lol
---
YES
---
why you jelly of your friends name?
---
did you want peanutbutter?
---
Stopping by to say that your argument is absolutely correct.
---
Everyone *needs* money, which is what a BoE is. A boe is of the same value to everyone, and if you want to equip that boe, you should buy it off the auction house. If you wouldn’t buy it already, then you should *sell* it if you got one.
---
I'm 24, and think streamer culture is cancer. Sorry to burst your worldview, old man.
---
I did not expect this pic to blow up like it did. Thank you guys for posting all of your stories. I sent this reddit post to coachbob and wafflesncoke. They are loving your stories as well. Thanks for sharing everyone. Hope to see you all in game. #Incendius
---
Hello, ladies.
---
So, my Orc and Tauren have different default heights for their casting bar...which seems odd. I have the same Bartender profile setup as well so the Tauren's is lower and overlaps my bars. [Here's the comparison.](https://imgur.com/a/w75Vg5A)
---
Anyone know what's up with that? Or a simple addon to move the bar?
---
&gt;If this is legit im going to consider quitting. Locks being unable to release infernals on lowbies and doomguards not aggroing onto guards was just a bug i thought, but if they are purposefully removing the griefing that was in vanilla i have 0 deaire to continue playing.
---
What? What did they do?
---
If he was tab spamming fireblast, and had the ability to leave your party you would have kill credit too. Kill credit is given at the start of the fight. You can't just boot someone and not get loot for it or pugs would do it CONSTANTLY.
---
It does. I'm not by my computer but go to Unit Frames, click on Player (or Target), and along the top, the very last category is custom text.
---
When it comes to a blue BOE it’s fishy and the proper way is if it has not been defined before hand anyone who wants to need, asks if they can and says why so the group can discuss. While it’s an upgrade, are you actually going to equip it? Even if you were, are the other members of the group ok with that? 2 either were not or they wanted to ninja for money. 
---
The TLDR is no one should need a BOE before asking especially one of value. Most don’t care about greens but some do.
---
This sub reddit finds it funnest to play the game using only 1 single brain cell

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d40kbu/shower_thought_nowadays_a_sex_robot_would/). 
---
I think this is a retail thing.  I don't remember this argument ever popping up this much until after threat was reworked and a tank could use 2 abilities and have agro on the whole pack over AOE dps.  During Vanilla, BC and even wrath I don't think I ever saw many DPS trying to argue this.
---
DESTROY THEM!!!!
---
He's not on my server, and I'm not even past level 30. End game min maxing has never appealed to me. It's the reason I don't care for retail. Endgame is boring. Sure some alchemy level ups need lotus, but I'd rather adventure the world and gather them, then just cheap out and buy them.
---
I don't think you need people from Vanilla as a reference. I did play back then in any case but the rules never change, if it's an upgrade, you need. BoE or otherwise. If you need on something that isn't an upgrade to the character you are playing, you are a dick. Unfortunately lots of dicks play this game, don't let their poor behaviour  compromise your integrity.
---
it's like the definition of WAR is lost..
---
There was a crap ton of wpvp on the Tol Barad island with dailies.  No flying there, iirc.
---
I had a 38 troll mage try to kill me at half health yesterday as a 37 warlock in STV. He did not walk away. 
---
If you roll a warlock on a pvp server I highly recommend going 10/10/0 before 30. It gives in an insane amount of survivability in world pvp and you can pretty much 1v1 anyone (except rogues that know what they are doing).
---
Just be aware, that while you can go that route, as you level, the cloth drops will change. So tailoring from the start will be linen, which is what will drop. Leveling it as you go makes more sense, because the drops will change as you progress.
---
Yes needing for upgrades should take priority. Some people will think just cause it’s a rare BoE, that everyone should need. The only situation i can see that being fair is if the item isn’t an upgrade for anyone. Then i think it’s okay for everyone to need. But i saw a picture the other day of someone that needed on a BoE for a good upgrade only to lose to someone that needed on it because “they could sell it, bro.” that shit makes me angry
---
I would roll need if an upgrade for me. I would have no objection to anyone in my party doing the same. I’ve seen a lot of people ask before they roll need—“hey this is an upgrade for me, cool if I roll need?—and everyone has always said “of course, go ahead.”
---
Maybe I’ve been lucky, but it just seems tacky to be opposed to someone in your group getting an upgrade. The “boe bro” twats in your group probably blow harder in real life.
---
Why is that?    
---
Did you not see the blue post?
---
This is my dream scenario. I still remember the people I played with while we were leveling our characters in early tbc, met a dude randomly around lvl 20 outside Stormwind and we played together for a long time.
---
If any of those guys came back they're probably alliance and I only remember one name.
---
You're a piece of work lmfao. Have a good one dude.
---
please stop telling others what to do just because you're lvl 20
---
Ele shamans have mana issues in raids. It doesn't matter how good you are or what gear you have, it's going to be a problem.
---
My phone does that exactly with Haha
---
They only rolled need because you did and didn’t want to lose out on an item, thinking you were trying to ninja. If you truly wanted it as an upgrade and would equip it on the spot to prove you are not needing it to sell, you need to announce that first before you roll.
---
Bis if you are serious about raiding. Mount if not.
---
Yeah its a pretty cool idea in concept, but for a persistent game world I didn't like removing *so much* content.
---
Are you still assuming that's what I was questioning?
---
Whoa easy man! Don’t shoot the messenger
---
Month? HA, more like 3-5. I have a bunch of my old wow friends who came back to classic, and are finally reaching level 20. They love the game, but don't commit hours to it daily like they did 15 years ago.
---
Despite being Ally, I really liked questing in the Flats for the like 90 minutes lt lasted. No running back and forth constantly, just making giant laps around the circle looking for buzzards and racecar parts between slaughtering every scorpion, basilisk, and turtle
---
If agreed on before yes. As I said best rule of thumb is ask before needing on a BOE ever.
---
i remember that BC (didn't dungeon much in vanilla).
---
Balance is basically a lock with less dots and more mobility.
---
I love TBC, but that expansion ruins WoW. Everything wrong with WoW started in TBC. I know it's been said ad nauseum, but it's true.
---
It will kill the classic momentum to just do a re-release of the expansions. People are playing classic because they want to enjoy playing WoW. Because they believe this game still has something good in it. Most want some version of classic in a continuous format. Either with retail's next expansion incorporating what worked in classic or a classic+ possibly. 
---
People aren't going to want a rehash experience of everything that ruined WoW and got us here. That will be fun for about 5 minutes and then the playerbase will plummet hard.
---
Exactly this. It's small, but god dammit, I don't want a Hunter rolling need on a green shield I could actually *use* as a Warrior when all I've had so far are greys... fuck you. His excuse - everyone stacked need on the last cloak... well yeah literally everyone needed that new cloak.
---
Sounds like we did this the same
---
  Back in vanilla I was all about AP - PoM - Pyroblast insta-gibbing allys in gadgetzan.
---
I'm more chill now, and rolling dot lock planning on draintank with SL
---
And now you have no guild at all for the rest of classic cause you *didn't stick it out for the first 2 weeks". But I'm starting to see why your froends would rather play on a different server.
---
I have no issues with the people having fun leveling through dungeon cleave. However, if you spent the last 15 years complaining that retail is too spammy and the world is dead, choosing to level like that kind of ruins your credibility in my opinion.
---
This is why there's PvE servers for carebears.
---
imo if the BoE is an upgrade and you’re going to equip it, that need should take priority regardless of how rare it is.
---
Friends and I had literally nothing but pleasant experiences with the community personally. 
---
But we are also on a RP and very non-pvp server. (Bloodsail Buccaneers)
---
I’ve noticed that the further away from the competitive/pvp stuff you get, the nicer people seem to be in general. 
---
(This is true in retail too. WRA and Earthen Ring are great, usually the toxic stuff is from Cross Realm stuff)
---
What were the dev's thinking? I mean, it's pretty much the first dungeon in the entire game, alongside ragefire chasm I believe. Its not bad for a first set.
---
Riight riightt...
---
Everything about your post is perfect except that you chose dwarf instead of gnome, the master race.
---
You don’t know Stan? 
---
Damn you autocorrect...
---
That's gonna be a yikes from me dawg. Something similar happened with my old guild leader and my ex girlfriend. At first we were all just friends, then he started getting really weird and she actually ended up moving servers.
---
What did they do?
---
I wish I could be in that scenario!
---
I use it to launch and I was getting this error. This is meant for people who use it.
---
i've seen it mention in other threads that the current patch had changes that made all but 2 raids pretty easy. i'm not sure which dungeons will be 'normal' if there are any.
---
This is really nice advice - particularly rage maintaining is really important to keep up a nice pace when levelling AND when tanking for dungeons (you pay with rage and you receive aggro).   
---
Another big takeaway from this post: First Aid can be used in combat. Which means you will one day get intimidating shout, which fears enemies away from you. If you overpull but still think you have a fighting chance, you can use intimidating shout and then bandage yourself, often getting you back to full HP by the time the mobs return.
---
The “need on boe” camp is right purely on economic principal. If a valuable blue boe drops, that’s a lot of gold for the potential winner. If you want to put that boe on, that means you value the upgrade more than you value the money you’d get from selling it, which means that you should probably **just go buy one.**
---
If you cant, because you don’t have enough money, then yeah - we all need money, which is why we all need this boe. You can sell boe items and buy yourself upgrades.
---
why would i wanna post here if it just gets instantly deleted?
---
I don't know about this addon but if you rightclick on a name from your friend list you can add a note.
---
Why else would I have a reason to call you stupid? 
---
OP literally typed the name asmongold 5 times.
---
That is why I questioned it.
---
Character notes
---
I love farming and questing in out of the way areas, and as such I am usually the farthest from the dungeon. Yet I always arrive first because I try.
---
The hell would a floppy headed, beady eyed gnome like yourself know of the glorious horde, friendo?
---
It's literally a key press, Ctrl-V into imgur, post to reddit.  Flawless image with none of this off-brand looking bullshit.
---
&gt;In other words, I'm calling the OP out on 50/50 having been "the standard" in vanilla. It wasn't.
---
I didn't say its the standard of vanilla, I said its the only version of WoW that actually works with that ratio on PvP servers.
---
In TBC its absolutely hopeless to balance it on PvP servers for some of the reasons I mentioned, while vanilla is very playable with that ratio.
---
And my point is that Blizzard should try to balance out the PvP server especally,  and another tool to do that could maybe have been to enforce server-wide battlegrounds instead of global so people had another incentive to play alliance.
---
I laughed too loud at this for some odd addiction reasons.
---
Well while I'm leveling my main and my first alt or two I was going to try and save all my boe stuff I get for my other alts. I want to eventually get a toon of each class ;D
---
Nah.  Flying ruined wpvp in Outland.  People were immune to danger by flying, so players just stayed on their flying mounts at all times until they saw someone below to gank.
---
Don’t say that, your dumps smell lovely.
---
Marking targets is always going to be required. You’ve stumbled upon the solution!
---
I randomly joined a pug raid on retail and it was my old raiding guild from back in MoP on a different server lol
---
Small interactions like that is what makes Classic so special. I've sat in Orgrimmar fishing, just talking to this random stranger for half an hour. I've already met so many people it's crazy how positive most people are here.
---
really no need to go outside. everything of importance can be delivered.
---
I wan daily words.
---
In what world (of Warcraft) are +10 armor and +5 arcane resist "not bad" ?
---
Judgement is ranged
---
Just tested it, 2 minutes ago and it works fine to and from booty bay, IDK what you are on about OP
---
On my paladin I got 3 bags off of the kobolds in the starting zone before I even dinged level 4.
---
and 95% don’t gank you, except the undead rogue named Thailadyboys
---
Do you play kromcrush? If so it was the other guy :p
---
Por que no los dos?
---
You don't need to respect, when raid leader can take another druid to raid.
---
It's not. Once you level it up again from scratch, you'll find a book randomly on a table in Steamwheedle Port that will let you pick a new specialisation. I just found it with the help of the other commenters
---
it is da law of this land
---
Could always give combat and dual swords a try if you just want to level till you get more of an easy toolkit
---
Can confirm.  Grouped with a rogue that went around killing other players for the first time yesterday. I was ok with it at first cause the other faction was doing the same thing. Then he opened on someone that was fishing and killed them while giving zero fucks. The person fishing didn’t even fight back. They just /cried.  I felt bad.
---
I leveled 2 shamans to 60 in vanilla, I immediately shut that shit down when I see it. 
---
Rank 1 earthshock only to interrupt/silence, rockbiter fucking never in an instance. If they MUST dps, flameshock when it's not on cooldown.
---
Show proof?
---
Well, for one, you can't post URLs.
---
On a table in Steamwheedle Port
---
Yes, exactly. That was their logic. But they also stated that they didn't want it in regular dungeons, and the distinction they decided on was raid lockouts.
---
Hmm another story of how good OP is disguised by complaining about other people. If you were really so good you wouldn’t need to rely on group play. Play your own game. If the group is bad leave and try again or just level up solo which must be faster based on how pissed you must be to post about your frustration.
---
It's not the healers job to save you money on water. Stop being stingy and expecting the healer to save you money when they are spending on their own water.
---
til
---
Lol.
---
But I feel kinda meh about this. Chances are the Rogue started the fight and the Hunter was finishing it. So it was a fair battle only for you to come in and demolish him.
---
Was inspired by the Priest racial specific abilities to flesh out a simple idea of advanced race-inspired classes that explore the more unique aspects of each race’s culture and canon powers. Was thinking something like certain race/class combinations can choose at a certain level to “prestige” into an advanced class that is perhaps more specialized than the standard classes. For example, orc warriors could become Blademasters while human warriors could become Knights. 
---
I really enjoyed the flavor and uniqueness of classes in Warhammer Online and wondered what it would look like if WoW did something similar from a Classic+ perspective. 
---
Pardon my awful shop skills, a graphic designer I am not.
---
You have a wand for a reason lol
---
&gt;bs the tank hasn’t generated threat on, and maybe you’ll have enough life left to life tap without qq’ing for heals.
---
Or just have a good tank that can hold agro. Theres tanks that hold agro like bosses and theres other tanks that just cant hold even boss threat this is the same issue as the healer just get good learn to hold agro simple
---
I love your names. Good job finding Waldo!
---
Herod is actually heavier on the horde side, hillsbrad is just a really popular spot for ally to gank and camp, and for wpvp in general.
---
/roll 100
---
How?
---
Son... a paladin? Where did we go wrong...
---
I think you missed the part where he called the gift 'trash food' and then spit on the OP...
---
The guy is definitely an asshole.
---
I’d try Zoram strand in AV, stonetalon will seem low to start off but has quests until lvl 30.  Can also run SFK until 30ish and shift to 1k needles.
---
If you wanna just grind mobs with it probably Arathi highlands raptors or gorillas in stv
---
Ok got it thank you
---
It's not griefing it's a creative use of class abilities.
---
Huh? I'm fine i just seen a thread with "healers" crying about life tap. Again 90% of my runs are perfect.

https://youtu.be/gWnsNlvd3Mw
---
I honestly don't know the technical part of it. All I can say is what happened when it did. Maybe we misread the entire situation and deemed his the bad guy. Maybe, it doesn't work the way you mentioned in the very early stages of vanilla. Hell, I forgot focus didn't exist in vanilla.
---
From what happened when it did, it definitely appeared what he did was a dick move. I could absolutely be wrong and have no problem being wrong.
---
poor lock, but i honestly thought locks did good.
---
because of the spellcleave comps. the sm ones are LOCK, mage, mage, mage and priest. im not at the LBRS level yet, but i honestly just kind assumed people would use locks the same way they did in the other cleaves (to pull mobs, tank bosses if needed and add in aoe dmg).
---
...tho thinking about it, it could be because locks aoe is fire dmg and LBRS is a 'fire' dungeon' (in that its in a volcano) so i guess its possible the mobs are immune to fire
---
&gt; When did he say he had no tank and a face pulling rogue lol
---
When he said he had no tank and a face pulling rogue lol
---
Classic+ is the ideal result imo, but it'll never happen because it'll bring what little people that already play retail but have interest in classic to actually play classic and not touch retail since new content will drop.  Classic probably won't bring in new players at the same rate retail does and in that sense retail will most likely continue to be Blizzard's main priority.
---
That being said I'd love to see classic+.  I've played Old School Runescape since it launched, I'm a fan of old versions of games going in a different direction for a different audience.
---
A million priests cried out for Innervate, and were suddenly silenced.
---
This is more about during combat if you read the post i said i drink and eat between pulls.
---
I do 1 full quest run for each dungeon, and quest otherwise. Grind mobs while you travel as well, try to never be at full resources running past mobs that give XP.
---
I would say just jump in, this is the game that years against everyone had no idea what was going on. Plus people are more then willing to help if you ask.
---
Dive in and experience blind is so much better then knowing what is going to happen.
---
QQ
---
Frost mage is pretty good at escaping. Lots of CC and slow effects plus blink gets you out of most.
---
Part of the skill in writing good questing routes is accounting for this limit. Ask yourself if and when you’ll be back to an area before you run the dungeon, and delay what you can!
---
I still havent decided if im going hard cat spec or if im going bear/cat with the resto talents. But im only level 30 i have a little time to think it over still.
---
yup this was my secret too. you should also consider making an alt if you feel yourself getting burnt out
---
Classic is an easier pace and much chiller community. Most people here will probably tell you to play it plain without any insight so you can enjoy it like they did 15 years ago.

The healer's job is to keep the tank alive.
---
The tank is there to keep the healer alive.
---
The DPS need to keep themselves alive.
---
on unimportant content that is incredibly easy too lol
---
Then my dad said "birth".
---
It's gatekeeping because while not keeping people out, you're saying that they're basically not true fans of classic unless they sought out private vanilla servers before, because that's what a true and passionate vanilla wow fan would do.
---
But you're correct I'm not saying you're keeping people from playing it.
---
Try the free demo, seriously, you may enjoy it.
---
I play horde on Kurinnaxx and I see plenty of Alliance
---
Personally I’d recommend taking the bear talents your cat dps will rely much more on buffs pots and manual crowd pummelers than a few talents
---
This is pretty dope.
---
My friend and I are currently rocking s warrior priest duo named Righty and Tighty. Sadly Lefty and Loosy were taken. :(
---
Easy? Sure. Fast? nope.
---
Only Warrior and Paladin are slower than rogue at questing. However as rogue is the least wanted class for dungeon groups during leveling it doesn't really help to be able to quest slightly faster than warrior and paladin. With the aoe grind meta groups being so common, you can grind several levels out of single dungeon with many classes, which wont be an option for rogues outside of premade groups.
---
I do agree that there is bit too much whining about how difficult the leveling is by some rogues. You can easily solo various elite quests many classes can't even dream of doing. Stealth, sap, vanish, blind etc. make bunch of quests pretty much free XP. "One of the easiest" is bit of an overstatement though if you compare rogue to hunter, wlock, mage, druid and priest. Being bottom 4 with 3 other classes that can all either tank or heal (or both) dungeons. One of those 3 even gets a massive mobility boost before rogue can even buy a mount and pallys get a free mount at 40 too.
---
I've done the exact same thing. Feels good.
---
I like to work with my mages so they poly right after the pull so I get initial agro.
---
yes  like i said, very little real life responsibilities. There's nothing wrong with it I'm just jealous.
---
This is an official released version of Vanilla WoW, not a private server.  Take all the time you want to enjoy the game... but don't be telling people not to be curious about the games future.  Classic has to evolve or it will lose players over time.  The vast majority of people playing are not the hardcore vanilla players that can play the same content for years without getting bored.
---
Blizzard either needs to alter existing retail content to be friendly towards Classic mechanics and expectations or create all new content to keep people engaged.  It really is that simple... and I don't blame people for wanting an answer from Blizzard in regards to their direction.  If they come out stating the game will not go anywhere after currently planned phases I can imagine a lot of people losing interest.
---
Dont buy items off ah unless your guild funds you to as a tank or main healer. If you are serious about raiding that is how things will work. You all should be boosting eachother up gear wise through dungeons and professions, even world drops depending on the circumstances.
---
Now for the mount. Epic mount is broken early if professions, which means more money, which means more consumes, which means better raids. Also if you are pvping its a must.
---
Lets not forget how much of a badass epic mounts are when people are still lvl 30, its time to flex.
---
Dungeon spam or server transfer. Imagine what it's gonna be like when it's all one layer... Jesus.
---
I forgot, do they still have the Buckaroo Bonzai homage?
---
I always thought Shadow Hunters were linked with Priests? But I could be wrong on that
---
As long as you have spirit tap, you can pick whatever you want for leveling. I’m spread across all three trees and just going to respec at 60
---
&gt;I'm going to [...] be extremely spiteful/petty.
---
Sounds like you're a great person :)
---
BFA boyz
---
Priests are generally considered the slowest class to level.
---
Vendor them
---
I remember at the time loving Chen and Rexxar since i was playing W3 to learn the lore. 
---
Looking at it now, if they would have managed to keep a mature enough narrative for the game they could have built on them a lot better in WoW
---
I do exactly the same, my general rule of thumb, is, when in a pug, ill always roll last, if everyone greeds, ill greed, if someone needs that doesnt need it (like if its obvious he wants to sell it) then ill also need on it and then reroll with the others that rolled greed if i win the item.
---
Is this a troll post?
---
my first ever character in vanilla was a rogue named Thillas so that’s my main now
---
Is mara farming still a thing?
---
spellcleave doesnt count :(
---
But there's also judgements, and uh... consecrate! Oh and buffs!
---
full t1 is bis for shaman until t2.5 for certain fights.
---
That's the saddest thing I've read today, did you try getting any help?
---
I am only 39 with a little over 4 days played. I intentionally have not installed any quest helping addons because I want to enjoy all of the content not just the end game. I found a great amount of satisfaction in figuring out the quests and and exploring zones I have either never been too or haven’t experienced in over a decade. The end game content will be there when I hit 60 so I’m not very concerned with how long it will take me. I went into this with the mentality that it may take me a couple months to hit level cap and it’s made the game so much more enjoyable.
---
Or, dont join SM if you're in bumfuck nowhere, get to SM, then find a group
---
I think 1 positive change would be having separate queue times based on factions would promote faction balance
---
The guild name fits
---
There are a bunch of different specs for lock, but generally speaking the "drain tank" aspect is the most effective way to level really. That being said, effective is relative to how well you can do on your lonesome usually, or just to cover that base at the least. 
---
Warlock spells are budgeted with bias towards your DoTs in terms of mana efficiency, but if you have your wife to pocket heal you constantly then you can just talent into Destruction immediately. That being said I would recommend at least getting your starting talents into improved corruption early on. Changing corruption into an instant cast is huge for warlock, and though you're trying to push destro with lifetap spam it will significantly improve your mana efficiency considering how much damage corruption does. 
---
Heres what I put for your core build:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/05--5050005122005141
---
First off you just want to dump the 5 into Improved Shadowbolt and then Bane because immolate + shadowbolt are the bread and butter of this build (mostly shadowbolt but more on that later). Because you have a pocket healer the daze / mana efficiency talents arent all that useful, and even then these are optional talents, and later on Bane reduces Soulfires casting time by 2 seconds which is HUGE considering its 6 second cast time and boatload of damage. 
---
From Bane we want to move onto Shadowburn for the additional instant cast burst and then into improved critical strike for 4 points into Ruin and back into the last point of crit. Ruin substantially increases your damage output on crits so once you have this everything becomes a lot more fluid. My personal recommendation is to move into Reach then into spell pushback resist, and maybe straight into the pushback resist if you want to get really wild with AoE farming mobs with rain of fire / hellfire, especially hellfire with a pocket healer. From there go 5 into improved immolate and 4 into improved fire damage and finally snag conflagrate for your final core ability. 
---
At this point your opener will become:
---
Soul fire ---&gt; immolate ----&gt; conflagrate-----&gt; shadowburn and this should kill almost all non elite 0 fire resist mobs AND players. Obviously players wont be amused with your antics so you should roll with your succubus with a macro for her seduction spell into your main combo. If they survive this combo for whatever reason make sure to try and use your instant cast dots if you cant control them long enough for seduction to come off CD and move into spam casting shadowbolt if they're far enough or searing pain if they're melee in your face.  
---
Against elites / bosses open with the initial SF into immolate combo but dont use conflagrate until right about when immolate is about to wear off for maximum efficiency. While this is happening spam either shadowbolt or searing pain based on which was the most recently ranked up / based on targets resistances or immunities (like fire elementals are immune to fire so use your curse of agony and corruption and spam shadowbolts). For the most part though if you're in a dungeon the healer cannot afford to solo focus you with heals so you'll want to use your soulfire once you have it into your DoTs and then start spamming your destruction spells. Before you get SF use your dots against elite / cc immune targets in the order of instant cast highest rank / dps to immolate always being last. You could also just open with immolate, the dos difference is inconsequential almost all of the time, but instant casts allow you to easily reposition so you generally want to use immolate last because most of your movement with a pull is at the beginning. 
---
As for the rest of your talents it's really up to you. Once you get to the point where you and your wife are raiding you will need to respec but with this build you cant really go wrong in pvp or pve until max level content. I would recommend just descending down into the affliction tree for the % affliction resist, empowered curse, felt concentration, but most importantly Nightfall which gives instant cast shadowbolt procs. 
---
Let me know if I can help out more in the future :)

Icecrown Citadel during wrath was the most fun I've had in my personal history of gaming
---
Just do a character transfer or refill onto a normal or RP server if you don’t enjoy the pvp. 
---
PvP isn’t the end all be all of vanilla and we’re getting battlegrounds anyways soon so you can still pvp there without having to worry about getting ganked while leveling
---
How many points are needed in suppression while levelling? 2? 3?
---
I think making every quest incredibly impactful trivialized retail wow and ultimates ruined it. There are tons of quests, having ones that don’t give you exactly what you want is fine. I love how dynamic vanilla quests were in that regard. Really makes getting things like your mount feel extra good.
---
Ok just pass along the bracers that are only selling for 3g though,  it feels nice to get them and your not losing much.
---
Just get this tailoring recipe on your main, or have a tailor make this BOE chest:
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18436/robe-of-winter-night](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18436/robe-of-winter-night)
---
it's pretty much as good as Robe of the Void. Don't waste your time leveling tailoring again.
---
Congratulations! This is the dumbest take I've read this month.
---
I want the third one
---
Heals are global aggro, so if there are multiple mobs, your tank should be doing what he can to keep all of them, this is harder at lower levels though. When a mob doesnt have some threat action against it, any healing will be the top threat instantly, so they will come straight for you

ClassicPlus would be the dream. I'm pretty sure they will eventually release some new stuff, maybe not in the format of an expansion, but a new dungeon here, a new zone there, a new world boss, some gear to make meme specs viable etc..
---
I agree with you, after last phase the servers would lose population pretty fast if there is nothing to look forward to
---
Group loot is on by default. So without knowing it, that's what you've been using in parties
---
Just curious how did you get the Gold?
---
Thanks very much :)
---
This isn't available for Classic as far as I can tell at the moment.  I'm not sure if it will be in the future.
---
I like it when the tank panics gets because of extra adds and runs away from the healer. 
---
That was a fun dungeon.
---
Honestly I maxed it out due to always out leveling zones and facing really strong mobs higher level then me
---
Spirit tap only procs if you last hit. It's great at solo questing but when you've got even 4 other people in a dungeon it's unlikely you'll grab last hit often. Then you get raids
---
r/classicwowplus
---
I'm on one of the generally FULL servers and the que tonight was reported as being roughly 800 people long... on a Firday.  Ques really are not a problem anymore.
---
I mean, it's a boe blue in a video game, I'm sorry it ruined your day. You'll get over it.
---
As some people already stated.. Healers priority is keep tank alive, and themselves. Then the rest.
---
If all goes well and he has time/mana to spare he can/may toss you a heal. If this is not the case, just use a bandage.
---
Credit to Youtube user Daniel L who made this and other WoW zones in unreal 4.
---
The quickest and easiest solution is to not waste your time with people that do not listen. If they do not get the message with chat and then you letting them die then you are better off kicking or finding another group.
---
&gt;To me, the mage doing the big dick aoe dps for the damage meter and the tank refusing to tank because their rules were broken the same in that they're both putting their ego ahead of the group.
---
This doesn't really work when the mage doing big dick AOE for the meters disables the tank from doing his job.
---
True, you are likely not to have perfect luck every time, but unless there is bad luck protection involved with the drop rate for items, it is not difficult to have bad luck. On the journey to 60, you will complete a significant amount of quests for both exp, gear, and other niche rewards. A large portion of these quests are drop quests, and if a person was unlucky enough to have even 1/10th of these quests take 40 minutes each, I don’t think it would make for an experience that many people would not enjoy. Sure, you can grind monsters and skip quests, and technically you could do it all the way to 60, but if I wanted to pay 15$ to only play a portion of the game, why bother? People that clamored for classic before it released often said that the quest text was very well written and it was something to be enjoyed too.
---
Firstly you should know that there's no tutorial. Second, expect to die quite a bit in the beginning. I'd recommend a pet class (hunter or warlock) as your first, as they tend to have the most leniency post-10.
---
It's in Luke Chapter 10.  
---
^25 Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”  
---
^26 He said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?”  
---
^27 He answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.”  
---
^28 He said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”  
---
^29 But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”  
---
^30 Jesus answered, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. ^31 By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. ^32 In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. ^33 But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, ^34 came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. ^35 On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’  ^36 Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”  
---
^37 He said, “He who showed mercy on him.”  
---
Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”
---
No we cannot agree.
---
ive had rogues tank entire dungeons idk what level this was for
---
but if it was 1-39\~ id say the rogue had done this many times before and when he didnt get healed the way he had expected...he ofc got a lil mad.
---
so it hard for me to simply call him bad or dumb. (hell a rogue friend was solo'ing SM bosses for loot at 36 lul)
---
If you played before you can contact customer support, some players got trial this way (kind of as a returning player special)
---
What skills to prioritize skilling if I want to save for mount as a rogue? I know im gonna skip my 36 skills forsure but not sure if I want to upgrade garrote to lvl 3 or the other skills
---
But Mind Control *does* initiate combat. And there's lots of ways to prevent getting MC'd. If you fail to do so and let them throw you off the boat, you deserve being thrown off the boat. It's as simple as that.
---
Look into downloading addons. You have to download the twitch app and you'll be able to install addons like questie to help you do your quests. Because no addons, going in blind, it can be a real time consuming challenge to find everything yourself
---
Whoever could use it as an upgrade.
---
Evanescence, Linkin Park, Breaking Benjamin, Green Day.

Nuff said

Someone linked this here recently
---
Just go bear form??? Looks to me like you a noob.
---
Ok, thats not what im even talking about.
---
Thanks weside, very cool.
---
Or go engineer and surprise them with some rocket boost + hamstring :)
---
You’ve made the correct choice. My advice is be friendly and let people in game know you’re new and many will be happy to help you. It’s a game where you’re going to learn more through immersion and vets helping than from watching YouTube. Enjoy (:
---
It makes sense, the only thing i get that really helps cat a lot is Omen, and thats literally the last thing i get.
---
Bgs will be coming out as cross server bgs.  I'm not sure you know what your talking about.
---
Works better for Alliance, those gnome locks make bank.
---
Exactly, don’t polish shit blizzard, focus your devs energy one classic wow, not retail.
---
&gt; i would say we are top 3 dps
---
In a group with a tank and a healer, yeah. Guarantee you won't be sniffing 3rd anytime in a raid with your attitude.
---
If 90% of your healers can heal you then why are you even complaining on reddit?
---
Yea omen can be nice for dps. Can’t argue that
---
It will get stale after a large chunk of the player base is rocking full T3. I think adding up to Lich would be great. Just dont move Naxx. Adding Mythic versions of all encounters would keep things fresh and challenging for years to come.
---
I mean.. You're not proving him wrong, I'm not sure the point you're trying to make, he's still right. Your logic is just inferior logic..
---
&gt;Blizzard really needs to reconsider cross-server battlegrounds
---
Sinister strike, evis... uhhh... stealth?  If you're combat you can get by with sinister strike spam into eviscerate, don't really need much else.
---
Do you know if Blizzard has access to chat logs? The guy was gloating about it in my case.
---
That seems odd that they would kick you. Maybe you have just been very unlucky.
---
But No the case, I would continue looking for groups to RFC in both general channel while in Orgrimmar and in LookingForGroup. 
---
Playing as either healer or dps should be fine. 
---
One thing to be mindful of: male sure you're not joining groups for RFK or RFD. These dungeons are lvl 30+ and 37+
---
Icy veins is a absolutely fantastic website and so is wowhead. If you need to learn to play a class use icy veins. Use wowhead for just about anything else.
---
Add-ons will make your life easier, id recommend getting questie as it makes life much easier.
---
Would you like to donate some gold ?
---
Your post lol
---
&gt; Hunters and rogues for example are terrible for the dungeon farms. 
---
Nah, hunters can pull like warlocks.
---
I made an alt, he's 21 now and barrens is more reasonable, I was able to do any quest I wanted and get help, if I had to wait for a quest spawn it was one respawn max.  My main's getting rest xp, it's nice.
---
Omg I love it
---
Yep this, the people who need all this water are just spamming mind flay, getting interrupted left and right instead of peppering the wand in
---
Yeah, I guess anytime I have a strong feeling about another fucking race that's just another color and size of human, I have to remember even most Horde players -- mind you, choosing between iconic alien invaders/refugees, the true OG inhabitants of Azeroth and one of the only undeformed races period, technically advanced goblins, mighty minotaurs, a tragic race of endangered people bound through the bonds of being mutually hated by everyone including their own faction and even some of their own members -- and with all of these choices most people still just chose to be skinny white people.
---
yeah i never said that
---
 Leave the game as it is.  I'm still not sure what your point is.  Your saying some wild shit with not even glimmer of a solution. 
---
Go play retail bro
---
Speaking out of my ass here but I think it's a talent
---
Healer keeps the tank alive, tank keeps the healer alive, dps keeps themselves alive.
---
Didnt realize how late this patch was until I read your comment. I remember those ZF changes and how easier the instance got afterwards.
---
I'll never forget getting that node for the first time then running back to the AH thinking I was going to be rich...
---
Absolutely, people still don't realize that this game has been theorycrafted for 15 years, and people know everything about it, and has a plan from launch to finish. Which is why for instance you see so many mages because people know they will be good for the entire expansion.
---
The same will be true for TBC, it will be true for wrath. Therefore I think adding new unexplored content and changes (if Blizzard can do it like OSRS) would definitely be a more interesting option than just doing \#nochanges.
---
no ones complaining i saw a thread of some healers crying about life tap in the comments so i made a post.
---
Hey! I just started a WoW subscription to play Classic, I don't own WoW. In game, I'm restricted from certain things for having a "starter edition." I thought a monthly membership would give you full access to Classic? Or do I need to buy WoW Retail?
---
Arms until atleast lvl 48ish when +hit gear starts becoming available. Or level as fury anyway, whatever you think is more fun.
---
I dont recommend lvling as prot, even for dungeon spamming. Its complete overkill.
---
The transfers are, afaik, only for full or high pop servers. You could try desolace, though being in kalimdor you may still run into a lot of horde, though being horde myself, I may not be too familiar with the alliance progression as far as leveling zones go. 
---
Maybe try Arathi highlands or alterac mountains? You might have to bounce around a little bit. Hope this helps and good luck!
---
Good question. Hope this helps to scratch the surface a bit. Apologies for the generality and fairly basic approach to the response but got the feeling that casting a larger net here couldn’t hurt.
---
In general...
---
Learn your toolkit but spend some time playing with or playing other classes. You can always find a duel outside Orgrimmar. Fight those folks. Get rekt. Review the logs and ask them wtf just happened. 
---
Don’t be a slacker. Full castable buffs when possible even if you are just running from the bank to the auction house. Keep fort, inner, bubble up as you run around. And use common sense in the more populated spots where ganking is routine. Pull a mob behind a tree instead of into the middle of the road in stv, jump up on rocks and other environmental details to make it awkward for someone to be in constant melee range. 
---
Know when to stand and fight and when to gtfo. You see people all day long running with their backs to their assailant who is happily chipping away at their life total. In my opinion if people stood their ground more often, they’d stand a better chance in pvp. Priests don’t really have many mobility enhancing talents so even if you try to fear/run you’ll get nailed with a gap closer or two. Use your movement to step thru casts
---
Invest in adding survivability to your class thru proper itemization and support tools. 
---
Engineering and alchemy can be your two best friends. Having speed pots, free action/limited invulnerability on hand can win you the distance you need to dot/kite/flee an encounter.  Keep tabs on fellow faction players in the area and bring the fight toward them if you need an assist. 
---
If you can outlast a lot of the initial burst and put your opponent in a spot where they’ve blown their bigger cool downs you have the tools to stabilize and start to edge them out.
---
Become a dispel magic monster. Can’t stress this bit enough. Offensive and defensive applications make this a premium keybind. Deny their buffs and debuffs. 
---
There are plenty more, glad to talk in game if you happen to be on Herod. DM me here anyone if you’d like more specifics as well.
---
It's cosplay man relax.
---
Also I forgot to mention that until you get Soul Fire you're going to want to play similar to affliction regardless, especially before going into Shadowburn and Ruin. You will need your voidwalker / wife to tank hits long enough for you to get your round of DoTs into shadowbolts or you're just going to sit there in spell pushback anyways. Especially before you get searing pain you are really vulnerable to spell pushback, but only somewhat so as early ranks of shadowbolt cast faster. Either way normal leveling combo is instant cast DoTs of highest dps into immolate into shadowbolt / searing pain spam. Be sure to reapply dots if necessary and use your more conditional abilities such as life drain or fear when necessary.
---
Sure, if the item is worth that much we can discuss things. If the item is worth 1g or less in this instance I'd think people wouldn't mind giving it up to someone who can use it
---
I don't know if it's bugged or not, but a disease you get from the wolves in Duskwood was horrible. 50% reduction in health regen for ten minutes. Somehow I get two stacks of that.
---
And apparently eating is considered health regen? So while the two debuffs are active I can't heal passively or by eating. Bandages only.
---
Isn’t all of the dev work for classic finished? What do they need to work on with classic wow? And I hope they don’t change anything about it anyway
---
Only items with higher armor budget are worth keeping for bear tanking. Sunken temple shoulders and brd slaghide gloves come to mind. As for quests the Ubrs quest that gives mark of tyranny is hard to pass up unless you never plan on tanking.
---
feel u
---
Yeah you're right. I'm sure the guy who got a bis boe epic he thought was trash knows enough about the games economy to make over 500g on the AH in a months time. 
---
That definitely doesn't sound like "inferior logic".
---
Desolace is appropriately named and also a 30-40 zone. It is a bit far, but If you want to do the Scarlet Monastery questline you'll have to visit Desolace anyway. Be sure to grab the questline starting quest from Sw cathedral only go there when it tells you to! 
---
After Desolace you'll outlevel most of the hordies questing in northern stv, so questing there will be easier.
---
Late in Legion I was doing world quests and saw someone out in the world who was in my vanilla raid guild, same name/class/race as I remembered.  I was blown away.  I think he had some kind if issue with me back then, mostly just said ‘oh hah hi’ so that was a bit feelsbadman.
---
I used to love mount collecting on my Human but when I decided to reroll tauren it immediately stopped being fun in the same way, as I knew that no matter what I would still ride the chopper and turbo-charged flying machine, as they are the only ones that allow me to fit through doors.
---
3rd class wise. My attitude ? I'm literally fine I think all the bad healers came here which I expected?
---
Can we trade this for the skeletons?
---
I did exactly this in 2008. Also as level 12
---
Thanks, I already have the Twitch app. Any other addons you'd recommend? Another person on the post was saying "wowhead" and "icy veins"?
---
its an excuse to ninja IMO
---
Funny story about Invincible 
---
I needed help to finish the Shadowmourne quests, so I offered my guildee everything that drops in the raid. 
---
And Invincible dropped.
---
Ya rag.. Is a bit of a flag to me, same thing on the private servers. I always remember fire resistance was extremely important, not just for tanks. It just seems to tickle people. My guild was not world first material but we struggled at a numerical value / gear level for a month on rag, with the Mind control fire buff and pots. Something has just felt off about rag on classic and the private servers. I vividly remember tanks aspiring for dark iron sets.
---
&gt; Dungeon farming before xp and demo-shout were fixed created an unhealthy meta.
---
&gt; 
---
Yep, it encouraged people to bring a tank instead of a fourth AoE.
---
It is truly incredible how a 15 year old game is still ahead of its time.
---
and at those levels it should have been.  it should be an intro to tanking.
---
Who the fuck down-voted this work of art?
---
Sure it can. Trade me vendor price and I pass.
---
Coulda fooled me. All the PvP I've been in except one encounter was groups of 5+ 5 levels over the zone, or level 40+ people on mounts taking the time to kill my pet before killing me specifically to cost me food.
---
Swords/maces anything but daggers really.
---
I think (if i remember correctly) that you can use old and new rank of spell while old is less mana consuming and you don’t need big dmg
---
And those people are going to run out of groups when they develop a rep.
---
Pretty sure all of them do polearms.
---
Best believe ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Bruh, I can't tell if you're trolling, but if not you really need to relax lol. What you didn't see was the other 99 times that guy did that and then didn't roll a 100.
---
It's almost as if rolling a 100 isn't that rare, and calling a 100 roll isn't the most unthinkable thing to try.
---
Mages will start calling themselves blue locks once warlock gear scaling takes off
---
It's those sad DPS warriors, shakily hoping *someone* will deign to take them.
---
Makes me wonder if ppl will continue to ask me to sap mobs in dungeon pulls....
---
ive caught a few in the ocean near Ratchet
---
It sounds like you installed WoW retail. Classic does not have a trial version. All you need is a monthly sub. Make sure in the Blizzard client you select Classic.
---
I am so confused by what you mean here. Pls explain
---
Making you miss your boat or running you off a cliff isnt griefing.  It would be if he followed a guy around and never let him ride a boat ever. Anyway, the people complaining about this are on a pve server anyway.  So they have nothing to worry about.
---
You forgot to show us year gear and talents.
---
Time value of money is critical in an emerging economy. It's how you become rich versus "able to afford your consumables for a few phases". Again I don't know the point you're trying to dispute.
---
I can confirm that this exists and has to be a bug. And no, it has **nothing** to do with PvP flags.
---
I was able to cast the 3 second mind control on them, but it just had no effect. It didn't resist, it wasn't immuned. It just had no effect. Cast ended, nothing happend.
---
In one case, I even tried it multiple times on the same target that was a few levels below me (I believe I was like 37 and he 33 something) and it didn't apply.
---
At first, I thought it was because of the loading screen. That you can't mind control people who are still in a loading screen. But as I said, I tried it multiple times on someone, and he even turned around and laughed at me :(
---
And yes, I was able to do this just fine in Classic. I haven't tried recently, but I don't think they patched it. To me, it seems to be a bug. And I hope that it gets fixed, because that is surely not true to Classic.
---
The only time you're getting healed from tapping in a raid is when priests aoe, which won't be often. You WILL have to manage it there, this is coming from a vanilla WoW lock.
---
Counterpoint- do not start with any addons. 
---
There is beautiful immersion in the struggle of reading quest text to try to decipher where to go. If you find it too tedious, you can always download a quest helper then. But once you go down the road of addons it is hard to go back to immersion the way the developers intended and I think it’s worth starting out a little lost in the grandeur of it all.
---
You mean shamaritan
---
Off the dock in menethil harbor and the dock at hillsbrad have kept me stocked on oily blackmouths
---
&gt; Again I don't know the point you're trying to dispute
---
I can tell.
---
I tend to agree with you here. However, I was under the impression that scrapped content from prior to BC would be (at least the initial) Classic+ content. That means, at least conceptually if not in actual assets, that the work wouldn’t exactly be SO massive.
---
There IS also precedent with the much-pointed-our Old School Runescape. However, I’m of the mindset that Blizz will probably start looking at player numbers in Classic as compared to Retail around Xmas. If Classic is consistently pulling more attention, I don’t think it’s beyond the pale for resources to be devoted towards development.
---
However, I certainly think the path of least resistance is BC.
---
I was 48 and was told a level 34 was unable to be charmed. Just after leaving booty bay. Definitely agree with you that it's bugged.
---
lol
---
Bruh, I'm being serious here. Afterwards he just kept rolling 100 after 100 just to show off about it. The group didn't last long after that.
---
Cath is very easy honestly. Me as a pally healer and my rogue friend 2-manned it all the way to Mograine.
---
It’s a dead server full of social guilds if I had to guess.
---
they seem to be salt water then, which is weird but I guess the private server got it wrong
---
Nobody gives a fuck that you have a MAC, it’s nothing to show off
---
So you're converting your HP into Mana, then I'm converting my Mana into your HP. So I'm converting my Mana to your Mana? No thx.
---
I’m level 41, lots of people are way higher, we did it and didn’t focus on our bad luck. I never got to raid the t6 dungeons in TBC but I always had it to look forward to. I love how those raids were locked behind a skill wall. I absolutely hated the raids in MOP because they were so easy and I was given so much gear it took all the challenge out of it. I would rather have stuff in the game I never get to see because I’m not good enough than to be given everything without any effort on my part. Design philosophies like that killed retail. 
---
It sounds like this isn’t the game for you. If you’re not enjoying it now it’s not going to get any better.
---
Just go bear until you have pre-bis gear my friend
---
That is one of the most brilliantly simple ideas I've heard in a long time. If there's a faction imbalance of logged in players, give priority to those who want to log in from the under-represented faction.
---
And that's how you know it's a good game, it never leaves you.
---
It IS true. I have attempted to do this after leaving BB being 14 levels higher than the target. game said "target is unable to be charmed"
---
RNG is RNG man. Some ppl win the lotto and others don’t. I would never be upset that someone else finished a quest in 5 mins that took me 45 mins. That’s just how shit goes. I don’t understand the sense of injustice over it? I guess I just never expected RNG to be fair. It’s just random, what do you expect? Would you rather every quest just be a flat kill quest? Cause that sounds boring as shit to me. I like the highs and lows of the low drop rate quests. Sometimes they suck ass but sometimes it’s glorious when your items drop quickly. Gotta take the good with the bad sometimes. Classic is great cause it gives us those highs and the lows. Not everyone is gonna get lucky and that’s ok. Don’t get salty over RNG. Life just isn’t fair sometimes. Doesn’t mean anything other than you were just unlucky today. Try again tomorrow not a big deal.
---
Vendorprices attaches items with prices you'll get selling them to vendors. It will help you tremendously.
---
u look sad
---
&gt;Umm what. It IS a mental illness... Theres no other senses of the word.
---
There's the sense in which he used it, which evidently lots of other people understood
---
I used to work at AT&amp;T and a customer called asking for me. My co worker took the members number down incorrectly by mistake and I called the number he took down. 
---
I ended up calling my main tank from my WoW guild from 2005-2010. We talked on the phone for like 20 minutes because he obviously lived near me with the same area code and I never knew. 
---
Weirdest shit ever.
---
Well it's there so idk who wrote your post
---
One of my favourite things about the Warlock class fantasy is everyone hating you. Like all the Warlocks just huddle together in the shadows circle-jerking about being MaSTerS oF tHe DaRKeR aRtS. 
---
It's great.
---
Deviate Delight crew unite! I might have stockpiled wayy too many deviate fish while everyone was selling them for low.. and you know I had that recipe day three ;D
---
Imagine if they'd make you immune to sap when you're near a boat so the rogue can't make you miss your ride.
---
Imagine they'd clear your dots when you enter an instance so you don't die shortly after you made you run though a camped instance portal. 
---
Imagine you couldn't attack players that are grey to you, essentially removing ganking, which is nothing but griefing.
---
If you don't want that, don't roll pvp. This was the answer in 2005, this is the answer today.
---
In the chance that you’re willing to have a discussion about this:
---
Imagine a simpler, more extreme scenario: the game is just warriors and priests, and the items are just swords and staffs. All items have a low vendor price.
---
If a BoP sword drops, everyone can vendor it for low money, say 40 silver. There’s a similar sword on the auction house that’s BoE worth 50g. A poor warrior wouldn’t buy that BoE for 50g, but would buy it if the price dipped down to 10g.
---
In this case, on a personal level, that sword is worth 10g to the warrior, and 40s to a priest. They both “need” money, so what are they to do?
---
It makes sense for warriors and priests to form a social contract - warriors won’t try to take staffs away from priests, and priests won’t try to take swords away from warriors, and everyone **selfishly** benefits from the contract.
---
It’s in your best interest to be known as someone who upholds the contract, and you also want to enforce the contract so that it doesn’t fall apart, since you don’t want priests taking your swords.
---
This is the social contract at the core of need before greed - different players extract different value from the same items to the extent that we pass up vendoring an item in the hopes that other people follow suit in a large-scale contract.
---
How does this work with BoE items? All players extract the same value from a BoE - the amount of money it sells for on the AH. If an item is worth more money to you than the cost of item on the AH, then **you should go buy one.** If you are unwilling to buy the item you’re about to equip, then you should sell it.
---
BoEs are money in item form, and should be treated as such.
---
If all of that checks out, then the question is “how do we distribute a chunk of money fairly?”
---
Options)
---
1) split the value. Someone could take the item, sell it, and split the profit among the group members
---
2) start a lottery. Pick a winner by chance (rolling), and give that person the whole prize
---
#2 is definitely the least work, and is probably what should happen in most circumstances. In the case where we decide to roll on the item, we either all roll greed, or all roll need. If we all decide to roll need, then *nothing bad can happen*. If we all roll greed, then the last person can roll need and then leave. In this sense, rolling need is strictly *less risk* than rolling greed.
---
Thus, the sensible plan to always roll need on valuable BoEs
---
Why're you holy and not disc? wtf you're not min-maxing and you're complaining about something not being efficient looool
---
Same thing happens all over RFK.
---
I think ill just go bear/cat and when i hit 60 if i really dont like it ill swap
---
The guy was probably just happy /cocky that luck smiled upon him. Gloating about your luck is not an offense.
---
While i agree with you, i think you sound like a major douche and is whats wrong with community atm.
---
Hmm...I don't see one with that exact name. Is it just "Vendor Price"?
---
Yep
---
Uhh classic doesn't have linked realms. Everyone you see is on your realm.
---
Weird boy
---
Same for arms warrior.
---
wasnt me
---
So I notice that Arcane wands do the highest DPS, and other types are typically less. Is there a reason for this?
---
Ah yes, because a man can roll 100, 100% of the time at will, 100 times in a row. Truly the most lucky of people.
---
No I convert my hp to mana? how would u life tap for me?
---
The starter restriction should go away within a day or two. My friend started last night and it was gone by today, but it can take up to 72 hours.
---
Spacebeard is definitely the person to get drugs from
---
Buy low, sell high!
---
It can take a while for all the starter account restrictions to be lifted.
---
Good thing you cast that lightening shield. Haha
---
Weird who is on your reddit account posting?
---
I still see 2 empty slots
---
Funny I've been watching the people raid on stream and guess what they are healing warlocks just fine while killing the boss with no problems?
---
The truth is, most people aren't 60 yet and we haven't seen how to Classic meta will develop. Sure, it's the same as it's always been now, but soon, I think we might see some interesting things come out of the woodwork. Definitely stick to your Druid, you can def raid as Feral. It might take a ton of work, but totally doable. Just need specific gear and to be set up a certain way.
---
Don't sell at vendor value!
---
Do you have pictures/video of him constantly rolling 100s? If not then it’s kinda hard to believe. Saying “100” in chat and getting a lucky 100 till isn’t unheard of.
---
The best advice about making gold is to not give advice to others about the subject.
---
Beautiful.
---
Sorry I hit send before finishing -- weird that yours doesn't default the same as mine, I'll try and check my settings when I get a chance but in the meantime, try right clicking the header for MonkeyQuest to get the settings menu - it has all the settings for things like zone headers, transparency, etc.
---
As for leaving groups, what I do is use F1 or whatever your self-target hotkey is, which will bring up your unit frames and let you right click to leave group.
---
For character info the default keybind is C - that'll bring up your gear and stats and stuff.
---
But thats what the entire fucking point of need vs greed rolling is. if you need it because its a genuine upgrade then need it. if you want it for the money then press the goddamn money button. Your entire argument is just that you don't like other people getting things you can't use.
---
Really it would solve problems for all players involved. Dominant faction faces less competition (in some areas) questing, while the less dominant faction faces less competition in the form of ganks. I just love competing and I feel like the competition is cheapened by large imbalances
---
Any thoughts on Rogues and Mages for trolls?
---
TLDR: OP thought he wanted it but he really didn't
---
God damn RIP my gf and I on Fairbanks alliance. Almost a 75/25 split favoring horde.
---
Please provide evidence or move on.
---
There's a priority though.
---
Tank &gt; Me &gt; Everyone else.
---
I know when is that shit gonna stop? Private server gods already beat the game at this point and people still telling me OH ITS GONNA BE SOOO DIFFERENT UR TIME WAS WASTED. Game feels the same to me, just much less bugs.
---
Automatically assort bags.
---
It's great but wait a bit till the beta/alpha is over and it's actually playable.
---
Lol actually you’re right. I wouldn’t want retail devs touching classic wow with a 10 foot pole. 
---
Eventually we’re going to need someone to port tbc over though, so somethings going to have to happen eventually.
---
I feel like I'm missing something here, played Vanilla through to WOTLK and now Classic always as a ranged DPS and enemy nameplates is the first thing I turn off.
---
Why would you want ugly bars clogging up the UI when you can see all the information for your target on the screen?
---
When did having name plates on become popular? Is it a retail thing?
---
I'm regenerating your HP with my Mana, then you are using that HP that I gave you to get more Mana. So you are taking my Mana to convert to your own. Again, I'm good. I'll heal the tank instead.
---
Everyone isn’t at end game, majority of people are in the 40s.
---
2 days played just isn’t very much, i and people I play with are in the 8-10 days /played area
---
It’s natural people will always join the bigger group or tend to do so
---
It’s been like that since ever
---
I am sad
---
Nah, we'd just kick you haha.
---
are you for real? keeping proper distance to your targets is a core game mechanic
---
Maybe the post is not the most PC but I've had probably 1 bad run since the game came out no problems with anyone so far beside that?  Wrong with the community tell people how to use their class i agree but if you want to get stuff done u cant just sit and be quiet. A change should happen a while its only a small portion of the game that cant heal right I believe that they can get good.
---
Can a rogue battle res? Innervate? OT if needed?
---
you?
---
You can set the upper and lower limits of rolls but it shows in chat, /roll 100-100 would only roll 100, but /roll 1-100 would have the same effect as a regular /roll.
---
This is an incredible writeup. I'm excited to try it because it seems very powerful with a pocket healer.
---
O man it's my pleasure. I came across it somewhere else on Reddit and it struck a chord with me. 
---
I always compare my life to a few years ago and get sad or worry about buying a house (or my mount haha). We forget to enjoy what and where we currently are. 
---
Sorry to hear you're not playing wow but it takes a bloody long time to play!
---
me and my buddy are both hunters. im an orc and hes a troll. his name is schut and mine is bahng. wanted bhang but it was taken.
---
You are part of the problem again healers can't life tap for me so that doesn't make sense
---
What are the ingredients for that?
---
This dude lost gear to a Ret and is still salty about it lol
---
Every meme spec deserves a chance, except ret paladin. If you find that fun, you are of low IQ and would be entertained by rocks.
---
Obviously but if you are a healer that is only capable of keeping the tank up, you got bigger issues than a warlock tapping too much.
---
I definitely remember that quest. But it’s not any more unfun than any other low drop rate quest. I’ve spent literal hours searching for low drops in classic. Yeah we complain about it but it’s not what I would call unfun. If that’s unfun then the whole game is unfun cause that’s literally what the whole game is like. Grinding instance after instance and raid after raid searching for that BiS item. The fun is in the journey not the destination. Sometimes it’s just shitty RNG. Not that big a deal.
---
Well 1 bad run is hardly worth all this fuss dont think you think? Just chill and enjoy the game, we are barely in week 3 remember that
---
It got my wife and I earlier..we resubbed and are both lvl 6 undead
---
YOU LIKE BAILEYS?
---
No way this website is accurate.
---
Says there's more alliance on Kromcrush than horde but if you asked anyone there they'd report seeing wayyyy more horde than alliance.
---
Retail. 
---
Vanilla lore wouldn't have 90% of the stuff included in this. Nonetheless it is pretty neat, even if I'm not a fan of it, and I have to say I've got a good deal of respect for the person that put all of this together.
---
God I would love to be able to see that full facebook thread.
---
Find you a melee group with a shaman. Windfury your way to top dps.
---
I was so tired I forget to take a shadowplay recording. I did get a recording of him rolling 100 against someone else who got a 100, and then got a 69 on the reroll. I thought that was funny at the time and recorded that, but didn't on the gloating afterwards.
---
I don't think you'd be satisfied by that anyways.
---
Faerlina average queue time around 5pm is 2-3 hours.
---
Yes, and Blizzard should start trying to deal with it before its too late.  Otherwise we will end up with faction servers, due to people not wanting to be heavily outnumbered. 
---
Blizzard should at minimum at least try to promote some form of faction balance, but right now they are doing nothing, not even a recommended faction tag when you are creating your character.
---
People want world pvp in vanilla? Well you are simply not going to have it if the ratio gets out of hand.
---
Isn't it a bannable offence to help the other faction?
---
Once you hit 40 on a warrior pvp actually starts
---
Again, cross-realms were not a thing for the vast majority of vanilla.
---
We are also getting the TBC version of AV which nobody wanted.
---
If you really want to speed level I reccomend following a guide. You could realistically reach around 30-35 in 2 days played.
---
The problem with Dungeon Finder was never that it made it a solo player game or anything nonsense like that.  The problem with Dungeon Finder is that it was cross realm and thus, server community was fucking obliterated.  It didn't matter what kind of person or player you were because unless you were in the same guild, you likely mostly played with people you never saw again after that one dungeon.  
---
Anonymity provided by this lack of server community meant that you could ninja all you want and no one would be able to say anything or you could become the most toxic player and no one would know.  These behaviors meant you would still get into potentially good guilds and progress far, thus potentially making it worse for your interactions.  
---
This means that, in the end, it destroyed the social aspect of a game built on a created community and a social framework.  What difference does having the game being massively multiplayer matter if you become more and more insular within your little group and no one knows you out of it and you don't interact with anyone.  All those other people may as well be NPCs for all it matters.
---
Thus, it destroyed the main aspect of what set WoW apart early on: the truly massively multiplayer experience that really made you depend on others.  
---
Couple all this with it porting you to the dungeon and you lose even more of the world.  As WoD showed us, eventually that kind of thing leads to WoW feeling like nothing more than a mostly quiet lobby waiting for a game to start, as you might see in gamea like CoD or whatever.  That all started with Dungeon Finder.
---
&gt; ~~battle pass~~ ***season ticket***
---
FTFY zoomer-whose-oldest-memory-is-from-2018
---
You sure he wasnt doing /roll100-100?  It makes it roll 100 every time and says (100-100) which throws some people off. 
---
Theres no roll hacks that anyone regularly uses and yes of course blizzard has complete access to that persons chat and rolls and they have years of experience spotting bots or hacks and banning them
---
Fuck transmogrification.
---
You could raid as Feral. You just need to find a guild that will allow it, which will be more difficult than finding one as Resto - but certainly not impossible. If Druid is the class you like to play, then stick to it. I wouldn't recommend rerolling just to be a part of the meta.
---
Agility gives you crit with all weapons. I know my priest appreciate agility on leveling gear.
---
Stuck at 45 almost giving up, the grinding's insane and no guildies to help... Any advice?
---
It’s much better when you get all your skills at 40
---
imagine not being heart of the wild/natures swiftness spec
---
I straight up tell dps that I won't help them if they don't help themselves. That includes ignoring kill orders and pulling aggro, using high threat generating abilities and pulling aggro, or not giving a couple steamboats for the tank to work.
---
If locks want to lifetap that is generally not an issue for me, but if the lock is lifetapping while a mage is tanking one mob a shaman another and the tank the third then they can fuck off.
---
That's not from lack of capability on my part but a desire for people to learn  through dirt naps that they need to calm down a bit. I have no problem ending a fight with just me and the tank alive if I think it's doable.
---
I mean... yeah, it's a season ticket *now*, but the broad term is battle pass and it originated from Dota.
---
Christ.
---
Tbh it looks like all the fuss is from people that are having problems. Again, I made this post as regards to comments in another thread talking about how they hate healing warlocks. So I made something official
---
L50+ in greens right? 
---
Wands scale badly without some serious good finds. Your rank 10 shadowbolt dps hits around 250dps (the GCD of lifetap drops that to 62.5% of the dps, or 150) in close to pre-raid bis gear vs a 50dps wand assuming you're just using a 50+ quest wand. At level 30, shadowbolt dps is 60 (37.5 after tap) vs wand dps of 30. This ignores your dots entirely, which is a very large portion of your damage in a dungeon.
---
Your numbers feel good, but the net effect isn't huge when you look at the probabilities for the big hits (15-20% chance to crit, whopping 4% chance for nightfall that doesn't reduce mana cost). Losing 100dps at the cost of weakening the healer's mana pool in pug parties isn't a good trade. You're also causing the healer to have a less firm grasp on your current healing need due to your health being less stable And of course the healer has cooldowns/casting times to manage as well.
---
Entirely different story if the healer/warlock play together regularly.
---
But it is often said when one wants to hear it again (for fight picking reasons or otherwise), and that has next to no effect in recorded text conversations.
---
The answer is to roll Alliance on Benediction.  Its about 55/45 or 60/40 alliance dominated.  We'll be able to actually do stuff in the world and have near instant BG ques when they come out.
---
You'll sometimes hit quest droughts. Find an obscure location/mob and just grind out a full level. Ideally the mob goes down easy, and drops good vendor items. It's not as engaging as questing, yes. But it becomes meditative. Try not to look at your xp bar.
---
Once you've gotten that next level, reevaluate your quest log. Chances are something may be more achievable. If not, keep grinding.
---
Can't believe I'm upvoting a filthy horde.
---
I’ve been recommending aptechka as a party /raid frame
---
Sorry, friend. We won't group up anytime soon.
---
&gt; Funny I've been watching the people raid on stream and guess what they are healing warlocks just fine
---
And those locks aren't tapping like you, 100% guaranteed. They know their place.
---
Club her on the head and take her hat!
---
Ypu don't see any information for your other enemies which is important for dungeons and raids.
---
Who even gives a fuck?
---
&gt; Everyone found it hilarious.
---
Oh yes, so hillarious \*still swimming to the docks\*
---
I'm not the Samaritan. That I'm not the priest, or the Levite. That I am the ill intent... who set upon the traveler on a road that he should not have been on.
---
I dunno. Azeroth is a big place, and each faction has multiple options for leveling paths. I'm fairly certain you can do six characters with minimal repetition of content.
---
While you're down there...
---
I could use some food.
---
i would honest stay clear of any advice saying take herb/skin or Mine/Skin
---
everyone and their mother does gathering and even on my server skinning leather at 225 lvl still makes me mostly vendor coins only hides are proffitable and their fairly uncommon. just my 2 cents. as for what proffesson be what you like from auggestions i personally would take skin/lw as you can craft your own gear.
---
Actually they are I can litterally see the hp to mana conversion on stream followed by a rejuv by the streamer etc
---
Ok?
---
As a member of the Horde, killing humans, kaldorei, and dwarves is my duty
---
Killing gnomes is my joy
---
Arugal representing
---
Come to Benediction realm, Alliance population is larger than Horder here and we enjoy controlling questing areas.
---
I think it would be neat if Blizzard gave a quantitative and qualitative analysis on the "state of the meta" and weigh in on 1.12 and itemization and how its affecting said meta. I just think we've been frontloaded a lot of power that we literally never had before.
---
3 if you only plan to fight yellow level mobs.
---
Literally met someone last night in a dungeon group that lives about a 10 minute drive from me and basically works next door to my house. Crazy how this stuff happens!
---
Aka you're full of shit or it was like a level &lt;10 alt you made once then forgot about lol
---
Hmm...okay, I'll try it.
---
What's the shamanic song name during the fight scene?
---
Just don't heal them. They have to manage their HP themselves most of the time. When I life tap to like 40%, I prepare to use something to heal up (GS, Pot, Bandage), but healers often panic and overheal me, while they forget about the others.
---
I had to grind SM peppered in with quests from hillsbrad, arathi, alterac mountains, and desolace. 
---
Don't even waste your time with areas overrun with horde. If it looks bad change areas and move on. 
---
I also grouped up with anyone around me, sometimes blind inviting, especially on elite or kill quests.
---
My wife's name is Ottovon and I'm Bismarck
---
Yeah we both know that situation is never going to happen
---
Watch out for da voo doo mon
---
Your goal is level 40?
---
(I kid)
---
or you can just stfu and let the dude play the game. they posting some world pvp they did. not bragging or dunking on the other dude, just honest fun. why be an ass?
---
No, a hunter kited it to the city
---
I second this.
---
I think they did
---
Woah. Welcome to Azeroth:)
---
There are addons but other than that idk. Personally I’d add this guy to my friends list so I don’t forget his name in case I ever group with him again and maybe whisper him to try to understand what he’s doing and judge for myself if he’s bullshitting or not. Maybe try to convince him to show or something.
---
Can an enhancement shaman heal dungeons while leveling with enhancement gear? Or do they need to be ele/resto with proper stats?
---
Kinda sad to see people try to skew the servers to be 1 faction servers.
---
I ask people not to do that as it will destroy the server long term.
---
I play on BB and I haven’t had any bad experiences so far. It’s been pretty peaceful and relaxing. (Alliance btw)
---
I guess his guild is all about surprises
---
This was funny 20 posts ago.
---
Sounds like you're just on a shitty server
---
You didn’t do it
---
Yep, and sometimes they have near unique text for different trainers.  For example, the Troll trainer in Org doesn't think highly of the Orc one.
---
Yeah and the content they add is nothing compared to nowadays patches. Itll be interesting if that keeps most people playing, exspecially the ones that raided before but cant commit the time now. Imagine you had t2 and now forever in blue gear.
---
I would not call census websites exact stats.. they are not anywhere near exact. At best they are ballparks..
---
But regardless blizzard isn't going to do anything else, cross realm is their solution and there's the whole nochanges thing.
---
Discussions in multiple forums suggest it's not a world drop.
---
Is that a steak knife within arms reach of the baby? :(
---
But.... that’s not what I asked
---
This is genius.
---
That’s not a bug, that’s a feature
---
that's a CPU not a GPU
---
Beat me to it
---
You've obviously never done quality fishscale blow and started craving a bowl of pho...
---
Really? I thought this place had become severely under moderated. Its become full of low effort crap.
---
its just a time sink
---
&gt;Going to look a lot like retail with 90/10 ratios all over the place by the time Phase 2 is done.
---
That would be the worst case scenario, I hope blizzard gets their shit together and never lets it go that bad.
---
My pet is a cat and I feed it like 7 stacks of meat a day, because I farmed mass quantities of shit their meat off low mobs. If you feed them better food it gives more happiness, but 4 stacks in 2 days is not that bad
---
Thanks for the chuckle!

Its a stated fact, that's how need / greed is intended to work. Your opinion is a popular but it doesn't change the fact that people are using the function wrong.

Druid healers are pointless in WoW classic raiding. Only priest and paladin matters

Daredevil, Season 1 Episode 13, _Daredevil_.
---
&gt; I was thinking about a story from the Bible.  
---
&gt;&gt;Did I tell you to open your mouth?
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Let him talk; Don't mean nothin'.
---
&gt;I'm not a religious man but I've read bits and pieces over the years. Curiosity more than faith. But this one story:  
---
There was a man. He was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was set upon by men of ill intent.  
---
They stripped the traveler of his clothes, they beat him, and they left him bleeding in the dirt.  
---
And a priest happened by saw the traveler.  But he moved to the other side of the road and continued on.  
---
And then a Levite, a religious functionary, he came to the place, saw the dying traveler. But he too moved to the other side of the road, passed him by.  
---
But then came a man from Samaria, a Samaritan, a good man. He saw the traveler bleeding in the road and he stopped to aid him without thinking of the circumstance or the difficulty it might bring him.  
---
The Samaritan tended to the traveler's wounds, applying oil and wine. And he carried him to an inn, gave him all the money he had for the owner to take care of the traveler, as the Samaritan, he continued on his journey.  
---
He did this simply because the traveler was his neighbor. He loved his city and all the people in it.  
---
I always thought that I was the Samaritan in that story.  
---
It's funny, isn't it? How even the best of men can be deceived by their true nature.  
---
&gt;&gt;What the hell does that mean?  
---
&gt;It means that I'm not the Samaritan.  
---
That I'm not the priest, or the Levite.  
---
That I am the ill intent who set upon the traveler on a road that he should not have been on.

pvp in vanilla has gotten to the point where it's completely min maxed to the teeth. 
---
If you dont use skull of impending doom, shadow protection potion, free action potion, iron grenades, charging helmet, bandages, or trinkets, then you are a bad player and you'll get clapped by anyone who does. 
---
You think this is a joke, but it's not. People are about to wake up to a rude awakening when private server players start dunking on them
---
I have an iPad. I tried WoW on it once. My husband got me an HP Omen gaming laptop and I got a lap desk so I sit in my recliner and Play WoW.
---
This. Unless you find someone who's new enough to not understand what makes a good weapon. You might get someone to buy it for like 10-15g if you are lucky.
---
Atta boy
---
The guy was having a pretty rough day from what it seemed. Was trying to spread some positivity, but it could be interpreted differently like you said.
---
Nothing comes to mind immediately based on warcraft 3 or any other lore I'm aware of, but I'm sure there's something. 
---
Could call it something like Hex Stalker for rogue? Be a debuff focused class maybe?
---
In warcraft mages were primarily an alliance thing. I picture those types of trolls being more "voodoo" focused. I wonder what a voodoo focused caster would be like?
---
But today it’s leg day in PT
---
Yes, but chain lightning can delete multiple people :P
---
How about you answer my question in the op? If this happened to you  what would you do in future dungeon rolls?
---
Not true. Druid is jack of all trades master of none yes.
---
But a bear is better than Paladin.
---
Feral better than Ret, enhance, arms etc
---
Balance scales great with gear and can surpass the hunter
---
No, mate. You came in assuming what I was talking about was the same thing you were thinking of, and gave me a lecture for something I try everything I can to avoid doing.
---
What patch?
---
This is a real thing, but it might be related to low rank MC. Happened to me while dueling someone. After cast bar finished the game just said "target can't be charmed".
---
Just the way it is, I played alliance on heavy alliance server in 2005, ques were long and we pretty much lost every bg except AV, horde had insta ques
---
The fucking MVP right here
---
Isn't everyone rolling need the most fair way to roll
---
You can target the players just fine, the cast just fails to finish. This can also happen in duels.
---
would you rather spend 20 minutes running through westfall to find him, or 5 min at the spawn point?
---
Thats cool. Even a warrior will be easy to level that way. With access to frequent gear upgrades. Casters will benefit the least I guess, though spell damage items will boost them nicely aswell.
---
Only if it's a high demand rare yes
---
Buy high, sell low!
---
Ok I'm glad I'm seeing posts on this. I knew FD felt completely fucked. Hoping for a quick fix for this as well as the erratic pet movement when fighting moving mobs that is just annoying looking.
---
git gud?
---
A good one I’ve found for rogues is to dismount and go into sinister strike or stealth
---
This bug has happened to me too as a horde priest. Might be related to some lower rank of MC.
---
Blizzard get a 2nd chance to try not mess up the game, sounds good. Keep flying and LFG out of the game and we eliminate two of the biggest reasons this game went to shit.
---
Why do you think there's a 'need' and 'greed' button? Ideally you only roll need if it's something that's an immediate upgrade, otherwise you roll greed.
---
Thats the big question in general, how should gear progression look like in classic+? The gear cant be more perfect than naxx gear.
---
Bad talent choices don't do it regardless of weapons. However 2 hand fury for leveling is the best option.
---
I have definitely also encountered people who want to learn and do better, and I'd be remiss not to say so.
---
Can we talk about when world pvp will be released?
---
When doing BRD our priest friend likes to say "I'm taunting" when he mindblasts, love it.
---
Taking photos of your PC with your phone in 2019 LOL
---
Did you have CC?
---
Ahhh the old strawman shows his face again
---
These are made by tailors.
---
You talk about Blizzard giving an incentive to play Alliance, but what kind of? You can't give them an advantage simply by picking a faction other than the given faction differences. I'm interested in what you might suggest.
---
Concerning your link, is it about one server, a region or total? Maybe i missed the information but i didn't find anything about the survey group. It looks like a lot of people simply enjoy playing a shaman over a paladin, or at least playing with one in their group. I know thats a small part of the inbalance, but it's one that can never be changed on a classic server.
---
Thats why i use the LFG addon everyone was outraged about a few weeks ago. 
---
It checks all the related channels and i have a listing of all grps that are currently looking for players.
---
The Island Of Misfit Specs.
---
Another low effort cat post. Downvote and move on
---
"Lots"
---
Its not that much if you dont raid or pvp.
---
You are the clueless one here. This bug is a very real thing and it has nothing to do with pvp flags. You can target the players and cast the spell but it just fails at the end. I have also had it happen in duels.
---
Are you using benthic gear and she isn’t? Because if so this is pretty disingenuous.
---
I would raid het, grind her, farm her
---
Elvui only supports truncated health. A slight way around it is to use the [curhp] tag in custom texts but its not perfect. 
---
KlixUI has a Elvui interface that allows for truncated health and mana to 2 numbers such as 2.22 instead of 2.2.
---
It may help if you state talent trees for what classes :) lol.
---
I swear you guys always find a way to make it into retail vs. classic.
---
Also in general, read your skills, because some specifically create high threat and call that out in the tool tips. Lot of people be mind blastin all #yolo like lol.
---
desolace has a repeatable quest at the horde flightpath that pays 55 silver per turn in.  i say this because you are level thirty and this will level you as well.  you get the odd iron fishing pole as well that appear to be listed for 1.5 gold on the ah.  dont know if they are selling though.
---
Delete the interface folder you made, load the game up, enter the world, then exit. The game should make the appropriate folders for you.
---
I was a paladin and happened to pug with an ok enough group to get my relic wep upgraded pretty early.  People would throw money at me to even tank Titan Hard attempts whenever I had the relic equipped lol
---
Not if there is only 1 IT guy at your work..  and your the IT guy :(
---
Why are you playing on a pvp server if you don't want to pvp?
---
I agree with everything you wrote. That being said fuck each and every person that tries to use layering as a shortcut. Every "invite for layer" should automatically mute your dumb asd for 12 hours.
---
Icey-veins website has pretty much all of the cookie cutters specs, guides, and whatnot.
---
true, but you can't do it as a fresh 60, you need at least some gear first. So I figured I'd grab the two mara pieces real fast while I was in the low 50's and could get xp from there still. Big mistake
---
Back in Cata i server transferred to play on a server with a buddy I grew up with.  Joined his guild and everything and it seemed like he was fairly new to that group as well. Got in ventrilo and was playing with another from the guild that neither of us really knew. After some talking we found out we werent only from the same state, but that the gal we were playing with was also from our same small town and that her mother was my buddy's babysitter growing up and a bartender I had gotten to know quite well.
---
Report the player in game. Blizzard will ban him if he somehow hacks or tell you to stop seeing ghosts if it's all in your mind.
---
Fortnite isn’t a game. It’s a disease.
---
Seems kinda scripted, the way he waits until he goes into ghost wolf to backspace and the "...", eh, i mean it's a good skit but trying to pass this as something that really happened? Come on now
---
rip, well I'm not surprised but thats a bit disappointing.
---
Custom texts are in each of the individual unit frame categories. Access them by going to ElvUI &gt; Unit Frames &gt; Player/TArget/whatever and its the last tab in that menu.
---
*attacks you*
---
Rogue sneaks up and takes the ore.
---
*quits game*
---

---
Servers still perpetually full? Thought of playing but the memes make out like I'll have to wait forever and I don't fancy that.
---
Unfortunately, in my experience, the morons doing this pulling are the ones who aren't decent enough at their class to get in the AOE groups, so they pull shit like they want to AOE it down, then can't kill it because they're terrible, then complain.
---
Noice.
---
Check the other auctions, 20-25g right now if youre lucky.
---
Yea, something something phone auto correct. Nice catch though, glad to see you have exemplary reading comprehension and caught the point instead of nitpicking.
---
Challenge mode rewards were asthetic and you only had to hit the gold timer once.  45-minute Baron runs got easier as you geared.  Mythic+ keeps pressuring you with increased difficulty and encourages running them over and over for RNG gear rewards.
---
I hate M+ because of its moving goalposts.
---
The op didnt mention them being about to run a dungeon, furthermore he definitely did talk about images should just hand out water for the good of the faction as a whole.
---
So maybe you should be the one paying attention
---
Youtube too.
---
Damnit. Beat me to it.
---
Thank God. I honestly haven't grouped with a shaman yet who didn't pull aggro.
---
Nono i use pawn only if i level someone on retail its faster
---
Which would be ninjaing.
---
This right here is what playing horde feels like to me, as opposed to the atmosphere of alliance. We're blood brothers at war and we jump in the fray without hesitation and only a battle cry: "For the Horde!"
---
The thing is, just Tried using Custom Text as the previous Comments suggested, Curhp tag still shows it as the 2.2k instead of modifiying it, so what command exactly should I type
---
Yes. An enhance. Healed up to sm lib so far.
---
Every white item you loot has AH value, get a bank alt and sell all of them. Lvl 50 right now with 300g doing this.
---
Later on a Warrior can one shot a mage with one attack. But you need to get there
---
They can die
---
?? He is completely right, Either the market value is WORTH 65g and it makes no sense not to buy and re-list them, Or it ISN'T and OP is complaining about nothing.
---
Is lvl 29 warrior tank good for BFD?
---
Also should I finish fire hardened mail elite quest for lvl 27 mail chest piece?
---
Also on Myzrael, having a good time
---
Real talk, it's not the accidental pulling that is the problem. People fuck up, and no one really cares about that. It's the people who are trying to set the pace of a dungeon purposefully pulling extra packs that are the problem.
---
I know that feel. I have 2 groups of IRL friends. 1 from private server and 1 from retail. I managed it so that everyone was playing with me on the same server. My friends from Pserver joined it with our whole guild. And so did the retail squad. The rest of my IRL friends grouped up togheter on another. Because they didn't want 8 hours queue. I chose to stick with the original plan since I know my buddies will quit the game within a few weeks. But it's a shame they went to other servers. Especially since the queue is 1h max during peakhours at this point.
---
It can drop in Darkshore or Duskwood.  I just farmed to today.  From the warlocks in Darkshore in the Tower of (something that starts with A) in the top West corner, or the Defias Casters in the little farm at the bottom left of Duskwood.
---
That's why you block pull. The whole point is that the mage ice blocks after pulling and nobody else casts so the mobs all have time to stack on the mage, then you blizzard on top of him and literally every single mob gets the slow. No group with a hunter can compete with that.
---
Wind be at your back
---
no
---
To be honest, quests are quite scarce once you get to this level. Blizz loaded up STV but even ignoring PVP the sheer amount of people there make tagging mobs a pain. I'd recommend either trying to chain dungeons or find a nice quiet place to grind around your level, ideally with valuable drops.
---
Which adds another layer to the issue, which circles back to it being easier to just need all BoE blues/ epics, and that line where ever it may be for you, especially in regards to the person that wants the item is, you go from there.
---
Using bad hardware for that extra Classic feel, I get it
---
&gt;my free time is valuable
---
Quit pvp server while is it still early. It is not gonna get better and with this mindset, you will just make yourself hate the game in a month tops.
---
That's awesome. The winterspring frostsaber is my favourite mount of all time! Looks amazing, almost like a wood carving! Grats on becoming licensed.
---
it still is ninja looting tho
---
Why are edgemasters good?
---
Nope all gone and the one friend I had thru retail seems to have quit.
---
Mmmmm vendor price
---
I feel like the whole point of having a warrior is to pull and tank the mobs. If the eyes are pulling, mage CC shouldn't let anyone get hit.
---
those are actually pretty cool concepts, go take them over to r/classicwowplus
---
I(lock) met a warrior here and we duoed these dragons 1 by 1. There’s a hill near the entrance where you can kite them forever if you have a slow on them. So the warrior kept hamstring up and I dotted what I could whilst running. At level 41 it took us probably 2 hours in total, but it was the most fun I’ve had in the game for years.
---
Druid don't have any good roll. Bear form = the warrior tank , druid healer = priest or paladin, cat form = Rogue/ mage/warrior.
---
They don't excell
---
But where's the magic in that? :O
---
I can't stop finding them its annoying.
---
Other continent.
---
You WOULD have the hunter flair
---
Thanks
---
I’m enh but have 5 points in Resto for reduced mana cost on healing spells, also have a set for healing. Healed everything fine so far, at ZF now. Only issue is grouping with multiple warlocks
---
Just to clarify, I would reroll to pvp as arms warrior in either case. 
---
I just want to know what spec would help me get best gear for that.
---
Last Maraudon run, me feral tank, rogue and hunter in group. Total of three leather agi items dropped, hunter won all 3. I know it doesn't matter it is not mail but man, fuck hunters am I right.
---
sudo gamemoded -s
---
Any help? I'm using Arch with a GeForce card and propriety drivers. Game runs ok if I cap my frames to 61 fps in wow System &gt; Advanced &gt; Max Foreground FPS (for some reason I can't select 60 with the slider) otherwise the frame rate is unstable and not fluid, rapidly cycling between 100 and 150 fps. On Windows I get 450+ fps.
---
Dude same thing happened to my buddy. He happened to glance down at barrens general chat and saw this guy trolling around. Turns out it was his friend waaaaay back from tbc who just so happened to be on the same server. Through him we found a bunch of old friends and are playing in our own guild with about 20 others.
---
yeahhh no that's not what powershifting means
---
&gt;You talk about Blizzard giving an incentive to play Alliance, but what kind of? You can't give them an advantage simply by picking a faction other than the given faction differences. I'm interested in what you might suggest.
---
For instance their shorter battleground queue (which they will have anyways) but on a server-wide basis instead of global. And if Blizzaard always has the tools available for people out the servers themselves (Free server transfer and faction transfer) people will be given at least some incentive to balance the servers out.
---
Blizzard could also do things like "recommended faction tags" on servers that people can actually see X server needs more alliance players etc. So some people can take that into account when creating a new character or transferring to another server.
---
&gt;Concerning your link, is it about one server, a region or total? Maybe i missed the information but i didn't find anything about the survey group.
---
Its the data people using the census data or something, and its just an example of how bad faction ratio can get if blizzard doesn't intervene. 60/40 H/A is playable, but worse than that and it gets dirty.
---
Best thing is that you usually save mana by healing warlock so he can tap. Him doing damage means mobs die quickly thus tank taking less dmg
---
Waited to long for a comment regarding this
---
I agro mobs and pull them near him and he would just target and shoot them too.  Didnt matter if I tagged first or not.  Possibly bots targeting anything.
---
This method!
---
&gt; You have to download the twitch app 
---
You absolutely don't need to download the twitch app
---
it's because OP doesn't understand that some of these zones aren't contested so many people aren't flagged and therefore can't be MCed
---
Environment artists are not "programmers"...
---
legs
---
That's how I feel with library and the staff
---
You get the deposit back if someone snaps up your auction
---
Only some servers are full and a lot of the time it’s just during peak hours. They have plenty of low to medium population servers where you won’t have a queue.
---
He coulda stayed and tagged the next one too, I guess.
---
Not necessarily. Remember that in WC3, it was Arthas, a human who became the big bad, while Thrall the orc chieftain was essentially a good dude throughout. Although maybe WC3 is a bit old and unknown to most players by now.
---
Lok’tar!
---
Or like other healers you can just do your job and heal like i said theres a minority of you.
---
Fearing in a dungeon is a good option to have, and if you get a bad roll you just cor it off.
---
Can't trust Human players. Either they picked Humans for creepy racial traits or they are people who are presented with 7 interesting races and still chose to be a really dumb looking human.
---
/p Marking %t with a {rt8}SKULL{rt8}, kill it first!
---
/run SetRaidTarget("focus",8)
---
The people using CC definitely aren't the people OP is talking about lol
---
Nah, Mediocre. Kinda like the difference between wanding and warlock spells.
---
big true
---
so do you roll need on every item in every dungeon or group you have ever been in? because you can vendor everything...
---
Alliance ITT: *[nostalgia intensifies]*
---
Horde ITT: *[murder fantasy intensifies]*
---
Much over thinking. No one benefits from having an undergeared warlock in the raid. They will dispribute the way that will most benefit the raid group.
---
Personally I like dkp or shit I can't remember. It's a list of everyone is in a list, if you're higher then someone you get first priority but every item you take you go back to the bottom of the list.
---
I love open world PvP and don't really care when I get ganked by multiple people, but there is just something pathetic about corpse ganking low lvls or griefing people in other ways, without a reason.
---
MCing people off the boat takes no skill, isn't really worth it except if you are a giggly teenager "hehe now he has to waste time for no reason and I gained NOTHING"
---
I honestly don't get why you do this. It's such a no-balls move, I couldn't bring myself to do it. I'd just kill them on the boat if I don't like their face. But if I just kick them off the boat with MC, they can't come back for revenge, which is the best part in PvP. When they revive and you let them reg and prepare. Then you both /nod and give it your all.
---
Ok thanks for the input, Jodac. I'm trying to go around using /who to check starting zones and stormwind and org and it seems like 1:3 imbalanced horde heavy on every server.
---
Hi, /u/Devildog0491

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d41ikd/lets_talk_about_this_hotfix/). 
---
&gt; Yes I drink and eat between pulls to help yea I don’t life tap when your manas low. 
---
Cool, you're probably not one of the people that healers complain about. It's people that just life tap to regen mana after a pull so that I have to heal -&gt; drink -&gt; heal their lifetap -&gt; drink to get full. If you're not buying my water, I'm not healing up your lazy lifetap after a pull.
---
If you're going to nuke your HP down to 10% while everyone is sitting down to drink/eat, or you think that a tank accidentally overpulling and getting trucked with damage is an appropriate time to Hellfire, I'm not going shed a single tear when you die.

Ty Ill try it in the morning

Wouldn’t the warrior just be able to hamstring you?

I don't have a druid in Classic to test, but that should do the following:

1. Change out of Bear

2. When outside water, change into Cat
---
3. While in water, 
---
 - Not holding shift: change into Cat still

 - Holding shift: change into Aquatic
---
Why do people think the tauren cat for is ugly? A lion with horns is pretty awesome. And their bear form is definitely the best
---
I may be wrong, but when i was questing in silverpine this time around, I discovered that if I stunned them somewhere below 30% health and brought them sub 10% before the stun wore off they wouldn't cast this debuff on me.
---
Either they cast this at low health, or I got SUPER lucky every time afterwards.
---
Berserker is just a fury with more abilities and priest becomes a shadow shaman
---
The other 2 things are kinda cool

But that’s just bc I main hunter

I'm plenty thick skinned. But I dislikee the comment. And if I dislike something, I'll say so. That is not being thin skinned. It's called choosing your battles. I chose this one.

Tauren are a naturally peaceful race, evident here!

Darkshore' Tower of Althalaxx is exactly where I'm continuing to farm.

---
Cheers, lad. Appreciate it.
---
I'd agree with you if the dps weren't also pulling extra packs.   I'd say I have yet to see a pack that if you pulled it alone is too much to tank and heal through normally, but when mages are pulling an extra pack or two worth of trash because they want to AOE and run oom with everything still having half health, then it's a problem.
---
I remember soloing these in Vanilla as a hunter for that quest. Omg it took forever... figuring out the exact path to kite one without aggroing the others. So rewarding!
---
So it sits?
---
A good loot council decides how to distribute loot in order to benefit the guild as a whole.
---
In practice, very often this leads to jealousy, rivalry and officers (seemingly) giving preferential treatment to friends or veterans.
---
To be honest, Loot Council is only suited for a select few, especially hardcore teams that have been together for a long time.
---
If you are already worried about loot, even if your guild will not give anyone preferential treatment, there will be tough times where you will feel like you’re getting shafted.
---
Loot Council seems to be becoming the norm rather than the exception, for whatever reason, but as much trouble as any loot system will bring, I recommend a simple DKP bidding system, or even a loot list.
---
Loot Council does not mean person Y gets the item because it’s the biggest upgrade or BiS: it means that fury warrior that’s always topping the meters and is there for every raid and dungeon farm is going to get every single weapon upgrade, small as it may seem.
---
Thank you kindly, mate.
---
It pretty much is 'omg, these healer are bad cuz they dont heal me killing myself for 5 more dps waaaaaaah'. This is you.
---
They dont like you. You waste their mana. Waste their water. Waste their time. Nuff said
---
MonkeyQuest gives you a big tracker.
---
i think u mean suicide kings
---
Technically useful, but why did you post that here?
---
I got into a pubg game with someone I hadn't spoken to in 10 years or so. But my story is a lot more grim as he told me about the 3 or 4 folks that took their own lives.
---
Glad your story was positive and upbeat. Thanks for sharing.
---
How did I get the recipe
---
Thanks. Glad to see free guides!
---
how are you not following here, jesus
---
Life tapping fool = more mana used = more downtime = slower runs. Learn to wand. I'll stick to laughing at the warlock begging for heals.
---
Yes!
---
Sikh
---
So it took like 1 week after launch before we became a carbon copy of r/wow cool cool
---
I actually find it a lot harder to speak to somebody online than somebody I'd meet in person.
---
Cute cat :3
---
I think this is a glimpse of reality I needed.
---
Let me explain the 'all need expensive items' school of thought.
---
BoE's  are different than BoP's  You can sell them. For some items, they are so desirable for somebody in some situation, that they are worth a LOT of gold, much more than the intrinsic utitlity value.  A certain  lvl 19 boe sword is worth 100g, while the exact same sword  at lvl 20 would only be worth 3g. 
---
So let's say a group of lvl 22's  are doing Shadow Fang Keep . This sword drops.  It's an upgrade for the rogue and the warrior.  But both would be STUPID if they would equip it at lvl 20+  Because they can buy an equally good or better lvl 22 weapon for 5g and keep 95g.  
---
That's why all 5 Need.  Each can win the same 100g  (or 95g + some AH buy)
---
This is an extreme example, because lvl 19 twink gear is special.  But the same applies for money epics.  You are a mage and staff of jordan drops?   What do you prefer?  150g  and a slightly worse weapon or 0g and  the best weapon?   since you will replace the staff anyway, almost everybody will chose the gold, and have a free mount + money for professions to spare... 
---
So the staff is not for the party, but for the rich lvl 60 who buys it for his pimped alt.   That is why all 5 NEED on the staff.
---
Stop seeing these items as gear upgrades, start seeing them as jackpot tickets , with a 20% win rate.
---
and remind yourself, sure, the mage rolls on your rogue weapon, but you can also roll on their mage stuff, so it's the same for all.
---
WHEN TO USE THIS SYSTEM?
---
 IMHO only for big money items.  for low value stuff, just use greed and need when it's an upgrade you will use.
---
What mechanics are you referring to? Life tap is the only one that comes to mind, and if tank does their job it doesn’t matter. 
---
Locks are heavy utility picks for dungeons, in transportation, banishing key mobs, free potions and FREE REZ FROM THE GRAVE for the whole team when they put soul stone on you, the healer. 
---
You should take another look at the class.
---
lol there is no trick to rng
---
I'd even call it "pathetic"
---
Its only like that on the big servers. There are plenty without queues.
---
 Give it horns!
---
How is this related to classic?
---
Healing tank is my job. Healing area damage is my job. Healing idiots is not. Kthx
---
This. I'm fairly sure it's a zeppelin. If you look at the bottom of the coin theres even a tiny square, where I imagine the little basket thing would be.
---
There's plenty of quests all the way through as long as you actually travel
---
I'll ask the question after the final phase.
---
Feral dps is only good in mc
---
Just because there's a few bad ones doesn't mean you should be throwing them all under a bus, that's a horrible way to think.
---
Feral is the best off tank in the game for raids...
---
Had someone join an SM group and then said they were going to get coffee, leaving his character camped in SW. At least start the flightpath!
---
It is. Still always gonna have people who cant begin to do teamwork. Such is life.
---
Yup, so you're trying to pass your entirely subjective opinion as an objective truth.
---
BoE's are different than BoP's You can sell them. For some items, they are so desirable for somebody in some situation, that they are worth a LOT of gold, much more than the intrinsic utitlity value. A certain lvl 19 boe sword is worth 100g, while the exact same sword at lvl 20 would only be worth 3g.
---
So let's say a group of lvl 22's are doing Shadow Fang Keep . This sword drops. It's an upgrade for the rogue and the warrior. But both would be STUPID if they would equip it at lvl 20+ Because they can buy an equally good or better lvl 22 weapon for 5g and keep 95g.
---
That's why all 5 Need. Each can win the same 100g (or 95g + some AH buy)
---
This is an extreme example, because lvl 19 twink gear is special. But the same applies for money epics. You are a mage and staff of jordan drops? What do you prefer? 150g and a slightly worse weapon or 0g and the best weapon? since you will replace the staff anyway, almost everybody will chose the gold, and have a free mount + money for professions to spare...
---
So the staff is not for the party, but for the rich lvl 60 who buys it for his pimped alt. That is why all 5 NEED on the staff.
---
IMHO only for big money items. for low value stuff, just use greed and need when it's an upgrade you will use.
---
Then why does any sub have moderators?
---
She's very pretty
---
This hunter didn't hide a trap in his jump, jump shot conc, or otherwise display any hint of PvP awareness. There is no way you come out looking that clean versus a brained hunter. Before you're disappointed ofc :)
---
Reminded me of this top sketch
---
https://youtu.be/rywVlfTtlMY
---
My /played time is 3 full days, yet I'm only level 33. (Human warrior.) I'm running dungeons wherever possible, and my gear is mostly blues. Is this "slow", and if so, what can I do to level up faster?
---
The OP is specifically about initial pulling of the mobs, not just taking threat after the fact, but in general, you need to give it a few seconds for the tank to get initial threat before starting to dps. If you're having trouble pulling threat, ask the tank to start marking the thing he's trying to keep main threat on with skull. Sometimes simply attacking what the tank is attacking won't work because he just tabbed over to a secondary mob to throw a sunder on it and will then go back to the main mob etc.
---
You can also use a threat meter https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicthreatmeter which may or may not help since in classic it's a little hit or miss. In general though it should help you visualize how much threat you're doing vs the tank and get an idea of the pace you can start dpsing on with each tank.
---
That's because it's natural to jump to conclusions based on your own bias towards people who are easily triggered. Is my guess.
---
But i say friendo...
---
Alt-right people love to feel victimi
---
i caught a bunch of blackmouth and firefin in desolace today
---
What new devilry is this ?
---
Damn, your character looks the exact same mine did 10 levels ago! Same hair and all. :D
---
It's not torture, it's just a bit harsher interrogation.
---
First I totally understand why it was hotfixed people shouldnt be able to show nameplates from 200 yards out. Its clearly an exploit. 
---
On the flipside why cant I see something within my range? Tracking multiple targets especially in pvp scenarios becomes near impossible now. Good luck tracking DR on 2+ targets over 20 yards away...
---
And you are?
---
There was no way because the hunter did absolutely nothing at max range. You can't catch a hunter from max range who knows what he's doing (if any class can, it's a mage or druid.)
---
I'm wondering this wouldn't be the Mankrik server by chance was it. . . I know of a Tiny but on Kael'thas on the Retail side of things.
---
"training his Aoe" aww he had to lie to you
---
I'm playing a druid and would like to spend most of my time at 60 playing feral, probably as a tank. Question is - should I pick tribal or elemental LW? Which one will suit this role more? Thanks
---
If you cant level in the world you do dungeon runs.
---
But he *should* in some way acknowledge it, especially after the 2nd time. A /thanks is enough for most people to be happy. It's just a social norm, and when norms aren't followed, people view that in a negative way.  We're not entitled to a thanks, but it's good to get 1 second of effort back when you save a guy 5 minutes :D 
---
I do understand your view though. When it's late at night or I'm watching a movie while playing, I prefer being asocial and not have any chats longer than Hi/Thanks/Bye. I stick to emotes, a "Thanks &lt;target name&gt; macro, and continue with my stuff to avoid creating room for a conversation. 
---
Macro for those interested in being polite with minimal effort: 
---
    /s Thanks %t :)
---
Where %t will write your targets name. Also useful for asking for buffs quick :)
---
Sulfaras, good population. Nice preview of future PvP and little to no queue during peak.
---
If he tags while in a group. The group gets it. Wow has always worked like that.
---
Find a niche you can control. There are many profession items that may have rare recipes or recipes/mats that are difficult or a pain to get. If you dedicate yourself to farming and making these things and putting them on the auction house you can do well.
---
Lmfao
---
I really with there was a common language that both of the factions used.
---
I’m not sure what’s wrong with people but I’m noticing a lot of inefficiency (lvl 26 STILL running deadmines, what the fuck?).
---
&gt; BGs are already confirmed to be cross realm
---
Got a source on this? I haven’t heard them confirm or deny anything about PvP yet.
---
download a threat meter and stay behind the tank on it.
---
Census data is out. Literally the only server that favours alliance is Pagel for some reason. It’s very in favour of Horde across the board.
---
I too am on Bloodsail
---
960 Mana if the lock specced improved life tap.
---
Level 29 is just fine for BFD!
---
Keep in mind most of the mobs will run at low health, so if you don't focus them down quickly, you can end up swarmed. LOS (line-of-sight) as much as possible, and pull groups farther back than you're used to, especially when you start fighting the Twilight Hammer cultists. Those guys are relentless.
---
Also: the non-magic satyrs will disarm you for up to ten seconds, so get lots of threat as early as possible, then spam demoralizing shout to keep aggro on everyone.
---
\---
---
Regarding the quest chain, I think it depends on if you're on a PVP realm. Stonetalon Mountains is filled with Horde players at (seemingly) all hours of the day. It might not be worth the endless corpse runs, unless you're really good at warrior pvp (which I am not).
---
Ok well I did it earlier and experienced the same issue he's describing. Just because it works for you doesn't mean he's lying.
---
Shouldve needed
---
Tongue in cheek. It's because the contextual clues scream that this is, in fact, not a rare occurrence for you. 
---
A. You displayed the lack of control to actually read his entire post, thus getting his entire take on the subject matter before starting your reply, as you admitted in your first line. Common trait in people who overreact. 
---
B. Your outward defensiveness of "us ADD people" and willingness/audacity to speak for an entire group of people, insinuating some kind of authoritarian take on all things ADD. 
---
C. Issuing commands such as "Leave us out of this conversation.". Again, feeling the need to champion for an entire group of people. Obviously not good conversational practice and definitely not something that is going to come across as someone trying not to escalate a situation in a friendly manner.

Pretty sure they are an ocean spawn, so they will always be on the issue.

Remember they are schools but you can also fish them up randomly.

Druids use 2 weapons for 90%+ of classic tanking. Warden Staff (or similar) for mitigation and Manual Crowd Pummeler for it's 50% increased attack speed from it's use affect. If you want to fight a druid tank for aggro when they are going off with MCP go ahead and try. 
---
If you're talking about dps then you have no idea what you are talking about as many weapons in later phases give AP in forms for this reason. 
---
Druid damage not being tied to their weapon DPS is great for them, especially while leveling and allows them to make use of weapons like MCP that another class would never even touch because it's from a lvl 30 dungeon.
---
I'm approaching level 56, and it doesn't feel like "halfway" imo.
---
Sure, the raw amount of exp needed from 45-60 is the same as 1-45, but keep in mind we're also gaining significantly more exp than we were at those earlier levels.
---
Horde only all the way
---
My issue with the sources is that they might be keeping track of level 1's, of which I'm sure people have many created, logged in and collecting rested. But I haven't checked them myself so I don't claim to have any counter statistics. Anecdotally I see too many 60's to think they're one in one thousand.
---
I don't think the "most people" argument is helpful when we're trying to split a hair between 1% and .1%. Either way we're talking about a fringe, so I don't think there's a dispute as to who most people are in this case, that's common ground.
---
Either way I obviously don't have any skin in this, just that my perceptions have been very far off from these statistics. But again, anecdote.
---
Random drop chance from pretty much any mob in the barrens. Or, Auction House. It’s usually between 1-3g depending on your server.
---
Depends on the server and time. Even on the most full ones, you'll have to wait an hour at most. If you head to a newer server, your queue time should be nothing at all!
---
It looks really nice but it does not look like wow at all. I actually prefer the cartoon graphics in wow. It’s much more magical:)
---
While also skipping STV? Not really. I've almost completely run out of yellow or lower quests at 45 other than the ones I abandoned in STV and a couple other areas that are so horde controlled it'd be just as bad. I have questie installed so its not for lack of searching. I've been to every zone my level or lower and quests are just pretty scarce in general
---
You can do it, you just need a macro :) Scouted all of Eastern Kingdoms yesterday :D
---
..or zone into anything
---
At least you aren’t a gnome!
---
31/5/15. Hands down the most useful warrior spec
---
The original servers are still ungodly long queue times because people are too scared to transfer into low pop servers.
---
I'm very glad I convinced my guild to bail on day 2 and reroll into a server that has a nicely balanced population like the one you're describing.
---
There is a difference between several players farming a spot and contesting it. As each of them is usually one not a crew. Then all the loot aquire will be subject to price competition in the AH since every farmer will try to seel their stuff. Now imagine only one players using several accounts contests the entire spot by himself. Not only he never "plays alone" and will most likely destroy any individual coming solo farming. But then he will get a monopoly of what drop in the farm spot. Since he has the vast majority of these items he can set up any price he likes and people wont have a choice but to buy it from him. Again when more than one person farm item they have to compete with eachother (pvp) but also at the AH with competitive prices.
---
wat. druids' survivability, mobility and utility make them one of the best wpvp classes. they should essentially only be beaten by locks, spriests and good hunters. and no, it's not burst that does it, it's the long game most of the time. then again, during leveling this could be different, but I've had no probs 1v1ing rogues as cat unless they catch me with a mob, and warrs as cat + kiting
---
I definitely felt like I earned my Plagued Proto Drake, but that was Wrath and the last expansion I played. It sounds like things really went to shit after that.
---
Run BFD and get [outlaw sabre](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16886/outlaw-sabre)  
---
Or go to AH and purchase [the butcher](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8226/the-butcher) or [sword of decay](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1727/sword-of-decay)  
---
If you're combat just get the highest top end dmg weapon you can find at your level and spam sinister strike for ez strong dps.  Don't get carried into gnomer to get some lower top end dmg sword, other dude has no idea what he's on about.
---
I wouldn’t worry. Once you hit 60 in 7 days play time you’ll have plenty of endgame content and you’ll miss the leveling. Enjoy it (I’m at 3 days play time and only
---
24)
---
Dungeon xp on pservers sucked, what are you even on about, why comment if you’re clueless?
---
Lol the winner posted the same screenshot on Reddit a few minutes ago 😊
---
You think people are asking for a BC upgrade to current servers? What's wrong with you? Obviously the idea is to have separate BC / WotLK servers as well as keep Vanilla. 
---
I'm super glad you're enjoying Classic, but how about we don't revolve the entire development cycle of Classic around someone who can only play 1 hour a week. It's not about you or your friends. As if Blizzard opening up TBC servers is going to prevent you from questing with friends on the Vanilla servers that will undoubtedly be left up. 
---
This getting so many upvotes just proves how circle jerky this subreddit has become. In what universe do you live in, where you actually believe there's even the slightest chance that when / if Blizzard releases TBC, they are going to overwrite the Vanilla servers they just spent 3 years developing, and being harassed by the community for the past 15+ years to recreate?
---
Depends on the spec and gear
---
Pretty much this, healed mara princess runs with my lvl 45 spriest.
---
wat
---
its actually a litte worse than that. I had around 900ping and you can tell op is also in the red 600+. But it is still playable when you are doing quests
---
Phase 2 introduces honor system.  Phase 3 introduces BGs.  If you're trying to rank in phase 2 without BGs, and you're playing as horde on a 70/30 horde dominate server.  How do you think thats go the only honor you can get is out in wpvp.  Good luck finding anyone to kill.  You're going to spend most of your time camping routes to instance or instance entrances.  And that will continue in your hour long ques phase 3+.  Why?  Because the guys that actually do it will rank and you won't.
---
Did a dungeon and a mage gave me 12 bottles, as a healer it was very anoying to keep trading him since we did the dungeon over and over a few times. Yet he kept giving me small stacks.
---
If they do move forward with classic, they’re going to make other servers and allow you to clone your character onto the TBC servers. Vanilla servers won’t go anywhere. Blizzard knows this; they know people would be pissed if they progressed current servers in 2 years with no choice from us in the matter. I’m fairly certain tbc servers will drop, and when they do, you won’t have to worry about losing your progress on the vanilla servers.
---
Professions, alts, farming gold, getting all the niche pvp items, etc...
---
You can't heal stupid.
---
deffinetly in the classic plus camp. I  would enjoy BC and WOtKl but im sure im not the only one who came back because classic wasnt retail and I'd hate to see it just follow the same flawed path
---
My condolences. The other day a group asked me to help them spam Armory to get Ravager. After 6 runs and no drops we disbanded. On our final run a second group whispered me asking if I could help them spam Cath, which I told them sure but probably only for two or three. So once we were finished I switched parties. I waited for 30 minutes for these guys to rock up. Made everyone food and water. A warrior and four clothies. I stay for three runs, and after they loot I said I was done for the night, and thanks for the runs.
---
Keep in mind I've rolled need on no gear in any of these runs. There is nothing in SM I want.
---
The 37 mage who had been getting partially carried was unlucky enough to lose out to the other clothies on the three runs. He /spits on me, says "fucking of course, every fucking time", and rage quits the group too. As if I ninja rolled and quit when I got everything I needed?
---
Is it an issue because of being on an RP server? Those servers are supposed to have stricter rules in regards to names
---
Lol nice
---
Sure, but if your entire server community is at level 60, then there is no server community for levelers anymore.
---
Unfortunate reality is that WoW wasn't designed to keep the 1-59 experience evergreen. It was designed to be a one-and-done deal and that's a huge problem because the five years of development that went into Vanilla were focused on that content.
---
Those five years become irrelevant three months into a server launch. 
---
Without Dungeon Finder you might as well remove leveling dungeons from the game because they're simply not PuGable by levelers within a similar leveling range with any amount of consistency. Waiting for a full group to run Gnomeregan on a server a year after launch takes so long, you end up getting better items and XP from questing solo out in the world.
---
What I'm saying is Dungeon Finder is a band-aid for a deeper design problem in WoW: Leveling was not made to be evergreen. *How do you fix that?*
---
I never go oom, dno wtf that guy is doing then. I cast 4 spells and wand, then spirit tap puts me back at full mana.
---
Research what items will explode in value at with each phase release and stockpile early.
---
Currently in the thousands with some items, looking to profit 10k at least right now. 
---
Obviously if values are close to what I'm used to.
---
Thank u
---
Hey I didn't see the setting so couldn't figure it out :(
---
90% sure he wrote sos
---
If it was that is fine but I want them to tell us that.
---
Yeah, not my finest work.
---
After spending the majority of my Friday night being ganked by groups of Horde in every 30-45 leveling area, I hope that hunter got ton of revenge.
---
I made the fatal error of "One more quest before I sleep",  grouping with 2 others for a quest in arathi. 2/3 of us were done in about 30 minutes but spent another 30 getting the last guys drops....
---
The acronym is MAGA. "I'M not getting political here"
---
Try getting orginal instead.
---
If people need roll on BoE I kindly ask them to equip it.  Let's see that loot in action!
---
&gt; And I'll take offense within reason when I see fit.
---
Within reason are the key words here.
---
Lol no
---
If you've been getting mass reported numerous times they probably think it's better to just make you change the name instead of dealing with claims and appeals over and over again
---
Ohh there are some in Thousand Needles, too, that have rhe same debuff but at 25%.  Took me a few to realize why I was getting rekt so hard
---
amazing
---
As long as they don’t take a picture with their phone
---
It was funny try getting a sense of humor.
---
Yeah were buddies. We work and game together. I was a little salty like at least let me have the karma if you got the blade lol
---
The good news is feral isn't good at pvp either except flag carrying
---
That's a capital F
---
Sure. With tons of mcps. I agree.
---
I've ran lots of m+ and never used any cc ever, not even in 15s.
---
Hunters are useless in PvP right now with blizzard not fixing and refusing to comment on feign death/trap not working. Go with Druid/priest/shaman/pally.
---
I've chatted with a few dudes who say they just straight up ignore anyone who says anything un-"LFG" related in LFG chat. Like if you respond to "DM&gt;VC" or commenting on someone else's conversation for example. There are weird dudes in the world. If they put you on ignore for any dumb reason when you've never spoken with them before, it is their loss and they're just crippling themselves as that shaman clearly did.
---
i will never not upvote distract videos on this subreddit
---
Do like other warriors I guess and focus on green quests as they still give the same XP reward. I have a 24 warrior alt and I rarely sit down to eat / bandage within 8-10 kills.
---
stvietnam
---
erm... you mean demo shout or did i miss something?
---
No, I don’t favor any of the two over the other.. I couldn’t care less about the classic vs retail debacle.
---
But I still think it’s pathetic of a mod to ban someone for stating his opinion..
---
My brother being an absolute menace to the alliance
---
Jesus thank you!
---
Draintanking becomes super strong when you can get dark pact talent. You get 0 downtime while maintaining full HP and mana and doing good dps. Best pet for draintanking is succubus. Disable all her abilities and let her just autoattack so you can drain her mana whenever you need. After level 40 I recommend to start gearing with shadoweave set + get orb from warlock class quest + hypnotic blade from SM. Full gear with spell power makes a lot of difference, you'll going to kill mobs faster and drain more HP from them. For example my warlock is level 41 with 3/6 shadoweave set and instead of draining 49 HP every tick my drainlife tick for 58 already.
---
It’s what I have always said. Wow classic and vanilla was the first (and still only) alternative life thing one can do. As a game in itself it’s too time consuming, but that’s not important if one look for an alternative universe:)
---
The mods I've encountered here are pretty pretensions crusaders on a mission of social justice and proving themselves as elite moderation staff. It's dad really.
---
Just let us have fun and be goofy stupid nerds who like classic.
---
It’s dangerous because when the initial hype dies down a little bit we are left with an overmoderated sub that doesn’t have the same amount of content coming in, what a boring place that’s gonna be
---
"I will hug him, and squeeze him, and call him George."
---
How could your rage possibly be full if you just spent a thunderclap, two shouts, and multiple sunders? Does rage build quicker at higher levels or something?
---
I don't understand this meme. You are drafting the things you thought you'd do this weekend? But you drove into the grass  and got confused by killing boars? WTF does that mean? WTF does this meme mean? Do memes just mean nothing now? Are we post-meme-meaning? Just picutres get upvotes? What is happening?
---
In the north where the lake is that bumps up to UC there are a ton of turtles and no others really go there
---
Good point
---
Mounts is the most important thing imo.
---
I use it to fear off a healer when a second pack has already been pulled or if the environment is totally clear of additional pulls.
---
Mobs run the opposite way they are facing. Run through them turn around then fear, they will run towards the direction you came from. So as long as you are clearing your way they won't aggro anything
---
&gt;So if anything it is just a bug.
---
If you’re pulling your weight, not fucking up, showing up on time with consumes and making a the raids you will get gear fast. If other players are showing the same commitment it often comes down to rolls and +1. At the end of the day it’s just “gear” though and imo you need to relax on the entitlement around it. Put in the work and you get rewarded.
---
Classic hunter... hah, classic.
---
I just got my Mage to level 20. I took Skinning and Herbalism with the intention of selling all skins and herbs to try and make us much gold as possible. However, I’m noticing herbs don’t sell all that well on my server. 
---
Have I picked the two best gold making professions or would someone else recommend a change?
---
So you don't think people need money in a game then go ahead to give two examples of classes needing money.
---
The last boss of Gnomeregan is level 34.
---
That said, I think the dungeon kinda sucks. It's worth doing for the quests and a few lucky drops, but I would never grind it.
---
Yeah no problem. Healers are highly sought after so you should find groups easily.
---
This quote popped into my head randomly while I was at a party tonight. You should know, I was fun at the party.
---
You realize that your initial comment gave no advice. Whereas mine gave the two best suggestions on the second line, right?
---
&gt;Questie and dungeon aoe groups make it significantly faster.
---
But by all means. Tell me more about how I didn't read
---
I'm a lvl39 warrior I was at Arathi Highlands earlier. I camped a warlock, shaman, and warrior until they went to another layer to get away from me. They were around level 32 or so. I only died twice to random npcs after killing them.
---
I kind of agree, I think a lot of people want would want to play TBC. As well as WoTLK. But what then? Blizzard is aware that everybody really hates cataclysm. So do they just stop there? They would run in to a roadblock in only 4 years, therefore I hope that they are future minded enough to realize that classic+ is the only way to sustain a revenue stream in the years to come.
---
Snowflake alarm!!!
---
part of the game is the suspense of wondering if some jackass is lurking just around the corner. i’d never summon an infernal to goldshire. but it’s exciting yo worry if some other jackass will. banning griefing removes this excitement.
---
lol if youre trying to say this mage had any semblence of a clue of what he was doing youre wrong. he tried to fucking nova when u had BoF. the horde disowns this piece of trash. btw nothing gives me more pleasure than killing the most boring class in the game.
---
Sounds like they don't read their spells. Usually I have to notify my shaman DPS that rockbiter weapon is bad and to not spam Earth Shock. Only use rank 1 for an interupt, please. Both generate high threat that let them tank early dungeons, but just cause problems as DPS.
---
I don't understand why you would do that.
---
Bought around 20+ recipes for 80s on the horde side and sold them for between 3-6g on booty bay AH. Nice and easy money ^^
---
I want improved graphics.
---
Or get guidelime and import a guide, preferably one for your specific class.
---
MUCH better than AAP imo, especially because you can see previous / upcoming steps etc.
---
AAP is OK but it suffers greatly from leaving you in the dark about everything.
---
I have to say, written / online guides are imo vastly worse than using an ingame addon based one like guidelime if you're really relying on the guide.
---
Try "Make Acronyms Great Again"
---
I don't quite understand what you mean. Do you mean they have to put more work in? Because that's been the Feral Druid norm for over a decade.
---
I don't think so. The Ravager from SM armory is better and it's useable from 37. So that's a maximum of 7 levels you'll get out of the WW. Less if you have to farm the mats yourself.
---
Nobody who rushed to 60 in 4 days is bored right now.
---
that was fucking EPIC!!!! Those are the moments!
---
i liked all the sound effects they added a lot to the vid imo lol
---
its ok man.  i feel what you are saying.  i have alot of time atm but that will change soon.
---
the grind is real
---
why are you being downvoted. anyone who disavows griefing is a pussy. it’s ridiculous that pussies even get votes. i support you. my one upvote doesn’t give you a positive score. but it’s all i can do. i salute you, anti-pussy.
---
I charge and hamstring immediately in pvp and come out on top 60% of the time.  Unless its against mage.
---
As a rogue you can tell your starting to get fleshed out when nobody else is having fun
---
20 your abilities start to be fleshed out, you'll gain a basic understanding of your rotations on most classes. By 40 you'll have 31 points invested into a talent tree and can begin to fine tune/refine your rotations for late game, and start investing in supplementary talents to compliment your build.
---
This is how things turned out once I made a FB post. Unlike, the thousand times I've tried before to organize my friends to play a game, this time they resub.
---
40 is the big one for most classes. The final talent in a tree is often pretty gameplay changing. It depends on the class though. Mage feels pretty good at 30, spriest and warrior come alive at 40. Rogue doesn't really feel good till 50, and doesn't really complete a talent build until 60.
---
Went adventuring in this post and somehow got into this comment.
---
By that point you should just have bought all weapon skills for the sake of having them tho, since you are 100% likely to have been to all capitals and it costs like 1g 50s total.
---
You’re looking at a few anecdotal mishaps and writing off the utility of an entire class. 
---
Locks are a solid dps slot with a ton of unique benefits, and if they know how to play their class then you’ll be thankful they’re there. A fear should never pull an add, unless the lock makes a mistake. It’s entirely avoidable.  Get past Deadmines and you’ll see a lot more clutch use of lock utility.
---
The grammar nazi’s what?
---
You'll end up doing both unless you live in Scarlet Monastery.
---
The gaming Gods forbid non-prot warriors from tanking. They have to get The Big Crits with their 2hs or they'll die. 
---
Jokes aside, yup. No need for a tank when you have 2 tanks.
---
Not sure anymore, didn't end up using it to level. I tried vanillaquesting but ended up ditching it for Guidelime and Ahmp's route. Worked way better than a browser app. I'd recommend it.

No int buff for you, friend. Be happy he was paying enough attention to give you anything for *free*.
---
Keep in mind that the less time a fight takes the less mana you spend, even with life tapping. Mana efficiency is important for healers and locks, and if both play conservatively, the benefit gained through the combo is much greater than the added focus necessary.
---
People who think MC is hard have a 110% chance of never having raided MC.
---
Data like that should be taken with a grain of salt. For all we know this data could also show that horde players are more likely to install an add-on like that.

Best for my class

Set for life... Or atleast 3 levels

You realize you posted on my comment right? You assume all this stuff about me, I wanna gank lowbies, I'm a salty player, I'm mad all these people are lvling up in a sort of exploitative way. NONE OF THIS I said. You projected this persona onto me. I just said with this large amount of mages, there will be lots of noobs. A sentiment, I might add, that seems to be quite popular. And some how I'm not chill? You could have said nothing and not interacted with me, or the poster on this comment either. You are such a hypocrite it's not even funny. And at the end of the day you basically agreed with me anyway, which I'm sure you will deny. It's all in writing. 
---
Look I'm sorry you chose mage. I'm sorry lots of scrubs chose mage. It's just part of your classic experience. The good thing is you are learning a lot about jumping around and arcane exploding. Keep up the good work!
---
How
---
Stack ur herbs!  Bank em.
---
I plan to be an Alchemist.  I would have done so from the start if it was more profitable.  Instead, I am also herbalism/skinning until I hit level 45.
---
I think a lot of is future Alchemists are going this route.
---
Once we swap over and empty our own bank stashes and more people get to a level where they can afford potions for dungeons, the herb prices will go up.
---
You have, but if you're trying to level as well you're probably better off to vendor most items rather than taking the time and bag space to save and post them. You still get a fair bit of coin until you start farming higher level herbs and skins, at which point you can start making a tidy profit on the AH.
---
Seems to be the case. I went to Longshore and started seeing some schools, the private server I was on didn't have schools so my method didn't translate well to Classic lol.
---
I leave it on &amp; report them as spam
---
How much is 1000 gold these days?
---
Ah ok ya that is kind of weird.  I would hope that bots are smart enough to tell if a mob has been tagged but who knows!
---
Yeah they're definitely fake, there's no way someone making self pitying posts on Reddit for attention could have no friends.
---
I MC'd somebody off the boat from ratchet to booty like 3 days ago, but when I tried to do the same thing again yesterday it gave me the "target cannot be charmed" message. I tried it on like 4 diff alliance of various lvls/classes and kept getting the same message
---
I’m still struggling to decide which to dedicate more time too, just recently started an Ironman and have been having a blast with it. Then classic came out and it’s also a ton of fun but something about Ironman osrs is just incredible
---
I just started to kick these people.
---
Thats about it
---
as a rogue...i care about my dps!
---
Fair.
---
Thanks for the support fellow sane wow player! Happy hunting!
---
This
---
Agreed. I also remember people leaving from the battleground as soon as they saw one of our good warriors or enhancement shamans. It was funny being grouped up with them. 
---
/spit a few times and then leave from the bg haha :D good times
---
In 'normal' setups I get to slowly single target dps the mob the tank has agro on, in AOE groups I actually get to use my full kit and requires good communication and and coordination. So playing with a tank is easily a lot more boring for me.
---
Shaman healers especially scare me if under leveled. Maybe it's just so many leveling enhac without a decent healing/int gear. I love their utility, but they burn through their Mana so fast.
---
If you didn't stop to do lightning shield then you would've saved him even more easily. Bad content.
---
You just answered your own question.
---
SO SICK OF ALLIANCE HUGBOXES SPREADING PROPAGANDA.
---
SHOW REAL STRENGTH. HONOR.

I WANT TO SEE CLUTCH QUEST ITEM STEALS. NINJA TAG COMPILATIONS.

You actually get to drink 2 waters at the same time
---
34 here at 3 days and 14 hours or something.
---
It seems fast to me.. especially as a warrior.
---
Thats insane
---
Yeah I guess proving dumb people wrong is the whole point of reddit right? Why am I surprised this guy is so excited about it lol.....
---
This thought has never crossed my mind. Most of the time when I don’t want to group it’s because I don’t feel like being social
---
Not in PvE (unless you shave 10% off every warlock and add it to the priest’s). Their PvP is ridiculous though.
---
Hedwig
---
Because they aren’t close to 60 in 2 weeks then they’ll never hit 60 is what you think?
---
I’m 28 atm. I play when I can for a few hours at a time. Not all time is leveling, just like everyone else. PvP, travel, professions, helping people, etc. 
---
But I played starting halfway through vanilla. I know that there will be plenty of people in 6 months who aren’t 60 and I know that they’ll hit 60, just like me. Because the game isn’t going anywhere. There’s no “ I’m going to miss out or get behind if I don’t complete all the content before the next content update”. 
---
Just because others get there first doesn’t mean the game changes or stops existing for others who progress more slowly. Whether I clear Ony on week 2 or week 52, she’s still dropping the same loot. 2 years from now there will still be people doing content for the first time.
---
How do I know this? Because 15 years later and people are still doing content for the first time.
---
Hey you got the joke
---
Shes pretty
---
Yeah quest drop in group = bad time 
---
If a quest wants a single item from a mob drop, then I'm solo questing. It asks for me to kill X number of mobs. Open to the public for grouping
---
You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
---

---
He thought he was going to win bevause he rolled a high number
---
because for the last few weeks he's outlined that to his group. i don't like the guy but sometimes watch the streams as background noise.  he's outlined the strategy for bindings a dozen times. tank, tank, tank, tank tank.
---
What else would you be doing months from now?   DM comes out, so thats a thing.  0.5 sets come out eventually, so thats a thing.   Not much reason NOT to try to raid, its not that hard, people will carry you eventually.
---

All Druids get it at 40. It used to be the resto capstone, but now it's for all the Druids to abuse.
---
I tried to MC alliance players in badlands and got the error message. I tried to used rank one (44) on 38-42 players and ask failed.
---
Oh believe me I remember, well I specifically just remember there not being much to do there but fish. But it's prettty oh so pretty and the loneliness of the zone is also kind of appealing somehow.
---
Its adibags :)

Whoa!

Every time I see someone post these, I just want to go farm random mobs and pray they drop. Excellent name for your gnome, Tweaks!

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d41z6d/whirlwind_axe_at_32/).

Cool, I appreciate the info.
---
Yes they can heal, but the lack of regular ress is bad when the stypid go splat
---
What is this quest and is it worth it to do?
---
Im a warlock. First ones free :D
---
The recruit a friend works for classic wow?
---
I would be surprised if they changed anything like this without a patch note. This smells like a whole lot of bs.
---
Couldnt remember. Just know I hadn't received it on mine yet and am bot quite 30. Thanks!
---
We weren’t talking about skill based, I was just responding that it was frustrating dealing with poor rng. I don’t care about the raids, I was referring to the lore that is in the quest text; if it was skill based in a way where I could target specific body parts to avoiding destroying the part that I wanted, all the blame would be on me, but it’s not unfortunately. So, if you ignore the argument about skill based issues, and focus on the idea that some people want to play it like a story book, sitting for 40 min so I can read the next quest is pretty unfortunate, no?
---
He called you a kid, meaning the dude is 12 years old.

If Brad is wrong I don’t wanna be right. Lol I’ve heard it as Brad my whole life. Even watching that scene again I still hear Brad knowing his name is Brett. Im not worried about it either way. Next time I watch the movie im still going to hear Brad and I’m okay with that. Not losing any sleep over it haha
---
Yea I loved playing my Prot Pally on BC servers. Twas fun. I kind of want to see what a BC server is like when everybody starts at 1. I think it would be awesome.
---
Good for you, most people don't.
---
Not just Warlock. For all classes Stamina is underrated in PvP. Probably one of the reasons I've been so successful in fending of ganks so far.
---
Shamaritan*
---
I see your point(s). I'm not a big fan of gatekeeping. If anything it was meant humorously, but I see it didn't translate.
---
I got the error in badlands on a PvP server. I am lvl 45 using rank 1 (upto 44) and trying on alliance lvl 38-42
---
edgemaster easily
---
Yeah that was what i was thinking about
---
Nobody else seems to have experienced this problem, so it's hard to work out what's going on without video evidence. The most obvious way to achieve what you are saying is to do /roll 100-100. but if you pay attention to the chat log, that should be visible, as it says: xxxx rolls 100 (100-100).
---
If somebody has access to some kind of hack that does something different, you need to report it - Blizz can then investigate.
---
You noobs get the winterspring frostsaber. What more can you ask for?!
---
Warrior is for sure a slug unthil you get mortal strike (at 40?). But hunter feels perfectly fine even from level 1.
---
[To put it into perspective](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Tough_Scorpid_Leggings) these are crafted with leatherworking and will take you to Maraudon+ since there are so few mail upgrades with agility on them. The BRD set is the only thing I can remember off of the top of my head.
---
Because you would be a max level tailorer, not a max level swordsman or whatever. You would not necessarily have the same benefits and abilities.
---
I actually think I messaged the wrong person and it wasn't intended for you.

The name of the Alliance Hunter guy is "Dwarf bullocks" in Swedish. He got them smashed!

great paladin, terrible mage

---
Stamina is the #1 stat to look for i thought? Its basically our mana
---
i need to drink occasionally and only have time to drink half as it is because the tank is already losing health on the next pack of mobs.  so fuck whatever shit is in that body
---
It's somewhat broken at the moment, I have a few quests that I've completed/am in the process of completing showing up again. Not sure what happened.
---
Stop the vanilla+ talk
---
They really made perfect the lighting in classic. I remember vanilla.....it was horrible.
---
The progression from hunted to hunter as you overlevel a zone is truly something magnificent.
---
That's fair. In all honesty my initial response was just meant to poke light fun at your statement given the context surrounding it, but after the whole bias accusation I figured I'd share how it came across. I can honestly say this has been one of the more pleasant misunderstandings I've had on this site. Have a pleasant day/evening and good luck in Classic!
---
How so?
---
He looks so happy! And cuddly! Not really two things I'd have associated with Illidan, but it works. He looks adorable!
---
I mean, you could always just quest. 
---
Hunters have the best solo leveling in the game.
---
(Besides AoE mages that are so far ahead of the pack that they have infinite packs to clear)
---
I'm asking what you meant by "1 streamer".
---
I've just started levelling my Gnome rogue "Munchkin". Very happy with the name.

It's funny to watch you cry about your guild getting their name changed, get a sense of humor. Also fuck your downvote.
---
who said anything about leveling professions? you cab just buy max skill for sub 100g... farming mats for robe of the void takes as long as it takes to level from 50-60, for example. lol.
---
His name is Wally you heathen!

Exactly what I thought when I saw this shit.

I'm just going to not reply to this one. You sir are an idiot.

Defias messenger ain't horde. :3

Same with me, but I'm starting to think I've used up my luck. My loot and chest rolls in dungeons have been awful since lvl 5..
---
That's gonna be me soon with Darkshore! Excited to be moving on the hopefully brighter pastures soon!
---
No Sunken Temple class-restricted quests are in at this phase.

Nothing. You just move on.

I'm leveling a warlock for the first time and the only guide i can find on drain tank leveling is a clickbaity youtube video. Can anyone either give me a rundown/spec or link me a proper guide? (pref non video)

Every class gets 2 points of armor per point of AGI
---
Okay nazi
---
Same gender affection was a thing in vanilla too;)

you said it yourself..."working on the rest of the game"

He definitely can’t reach that. He can only reach about 1/2” off the edge of his tray.

You’ve just been unlucky. The pattern does drop. 
---
I got it on my tailor after 30 or so kills on the warlocks in Darkshore.
---
Hunter level 9 is the only difficult level
---
The people who are not sincere about joining the other faction would abuse this. Better to let the Horde or Alliance decide on who joins from the other side or not.  
---
For Lordaeron!
---
Classic codex is doing the same thing. It'll show quests as available when it isn't yet (haven't met the requirements) or it'll show a quest I already did as available. Not always. I like having a quest helper so I'll take it's few bugs
---
I havnt downvoted anything and I am not crying about it. I just want to know why one person says it's okay the other says it isnt.
---
We pvp IRL
---
There's a big difference between PvP and being camped for hours on end by an enemy a dozen levels higher than you are.

here to second this. look up dive's drain tanking guide its great for leveling

What an idiot.

Bet these people are as entitled and and dumb in real life as they are in wow.

If its really that bad people will just quit lol
---
Reminder for me to find this again later :)
---
I am embarrassed for you.
---
When I was new to the game I thought the "10 minutes remaining"  on the tetanus debuff I got in Westfall meant I would die in 10 minutes.
---
This is how most streamers make it from 50-60. Streamer can be switched with random.
---
Boy how about you don't speak for people of color because there are plenty of people of color wearing Maga hats
---
Sounds like a plan to me! I'm personally excited to get the Divine spirit buff in disc first (purely because I like buffing people haha). But the reduced casting time is obviously important in any heal build so I'll get it eventually.
---
No, the active effect is superior to every other weapon in vanilla, up to and including Atiesh.
---
If nobody needs the BOE except for the gold from AH - who is buying the item from AH? Possibly a class that actually needs it, like the one that might be rolling against you?
---
It's a weird argument that seems to be common on this sub and that's fine, and I'll see what everyone else rolls first - but it's just something to think about. I'd sure as heck equip Staff of Jordan if I got it in a drop.
---
I sympathize if you or someone you know suffers from a mental affliction. That doesn't change the fact that schizophrenia is a word that is from Greek roots, and therefore cannot exclusively refer to the mental illness, as the word existed before our psychology was advanced enough to give it a name. It is a combination of the Greek skhizein ("to split") and phren ("mind"), and was used to describe everything from thought, art, writing, behavior, events, and more before psychiatrist Kurt Schneider started defining the term for the illness in the early 20th century.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong. The word schizophrenia can indeed refer to a certain mental illness. I am saying there are other uses for the word that you were not aware of.
---
I’ve always been partial to Raptors. They have good dps/tank stats and can learn Bite and Claw. Plus who doesn’t want a fucking raptor as a pet?? (Looks especially cool with BW)
---
"dead server" aka more populated than any vanilla server
---
Nice story. But why do you have to pay Mage to help you? Normally it's not like that, but ok.
---
As you get the pet from level 10....I see
---
Why resto shaman over disc priest? I’ve never played melee cleave, but more important I’ve never played Horde.
---
Shadow Labyrinth

That could also be it
---
I actually think Classic caters far, far more to the lower end of players.
---
How? By not coddling them.
---
Retail WoW can be hard. It absolutely can be, running high level M+, running Mythic and, to some extent, heroic raids. But the game does not care to challenge the player outside of that. If you do not opt into that content, you will very likely never feel particularly challenged in modern WoW.
---
Conversely, if played more or less as intended anyway, classic WoW has a much higher baseline difficulty. A lot of classes struggle to fight multiple mobs in the overworld by themselves. Even low level dungeons can be challenging, simply due to the way aggro and mana mechanics work and the fact dungeon mobs are quite dangerous to non-tanky classes.
---
They aren't terribly difficult to learn, not in the way the complicated dances and routines required for top-end retail raiding can be, but they put a requirement on the player to apply themself, and even from an early level seperate the skilled from the unskilled. While bad DPS in retail tend to do very little damage and get themselves killed in retail, and simply won't be invited to even heroic raiding, in Classic they can outright cause a wipe by causing the tank to lose control of the pack.
---
Someone questing who knows how to manage positioning and kill/kite effectively is going to have markably more success than the player who keeps dying because he can't watch his back for roving mobs or gankers. Retail questing is an actual joke.
---
The game, from the start, expects just a *little* more out of you. Not much, but enough to be engaging.
---
Your thoughts are appreciated, and a wonderful evening and good luck to you as well!
---
Would you mind telling me what site I go to for addons like questie
---
Well tbf, Isreael was utterly destroyed by the Assyrians, and although Judea was roflstomped by Babylon, Cyrus eventually let them go back home and rebuild the temple. 
---
Which is why we still have "Jews"* and we don't have Israelites. David's grandkids had a fight about succession, and the kingdom split in two. 
---
*We really don't have any Jews today, because Judea was utterly destroyed by Rome in 70AD.  What we have today is a group of people that adopted Jewish pharisaism.
---
These ones are incomplete though
---
Please read up on what ascii actually is. The regular english alphabet is part of the ascii encoding. I'm well aware that you mean special characters such as letters with accents but that's not ascii. Have a good day :)
---
Play Classic and start from the beginning.
---
Take time to explore the menus, abilities, combat, loot system, explore the map, soak in the visuals and audio.
---
Take your time, don't rush.
---
You will die alot, that's OK. 
---
One thing I would recommend is to actually read the game original instruction manual that was included in the box way back when, I'm sure it's on the blizzard website. 
---
I wish I could forget all the years of wow and play fresh again.
---
Good luck my friend, and have fun.
---
Less competition for me then lol

Yep that one’s a bitch. Oh well guess I’ll do absolutely nothing for 10 minutes. Thanks

Jeez that first close-up blow wrecked him. What happened?

At 31 you could solo parts of gnomes? Awesome.

Ah, the ez life. Normal servers.
---
Oh man you'd love to see the GW2 community's takes on vanilla WoW
---
That whole fuckin place is filled with morons who're convinced that Vanilla WoW required you to memorize and use 80 keybinds for every encounter and that it was 100% impossible to even do 5 man dungeons unless you were playing a hundred hours a week just grinding bank tabs full of consumables.
---
And man, the number of people who were willfully ignorant about why such a small portion of the playerbase completed it.
---
It totally wasn't at all that Blizzard had announced an expansion with a raised level cap before they released Naxx resulting in the vast majority of the playerbase saying "fuck it, not worth it if my gear is just gonna be irrelevant in 2 months"
---
It totally wasn't at all that the Four Horsemen fight was a gear chokepoint that, in combination with the short time until the expansion meaning that no guild would have enough warriors with the requisite set bonuses before the expac dropped unless they poached tanks from other guilds---Leading to many guilds falling apart after their first tank picked up the set bonus and was snatched up by a better guild.
---
And the attunement itself totally wasn't something that you could farm out by yourself in a few hours /played killing shit in the plaguelands (if you weren't one of the many, many people who'd already done that while leveling to 60)
---
No no no no, the GW2 community is absolutely *totally* correct that vanilla WoW was only for the most super-extremely hardcore elitist players who could manage enough hotkeys to play beethoven's ninth and hadn't left their toilet+minifridge basement for the last 6 years, and it was totally so completely exclusively hardcore that attunement required thousands of hours and thousands of for a single person, it was totally that you needed to spend 100 hours a week farming consumables and then another 50  (across 3 days) just to finish the raid itself.

America casts Boston tea party

I saw the same guy on the boat back and decided to give him a break. Then a bunch of skull alliance came and started murdering all the horde on the boat.
---
No I do not, to be honest even if he can tank it with those talents, i can put these talents yet on my level to something that benefits me more. Hunters pet was able to hold aggro on the damage of the hunter and mine.
---
/r/BoneAppleTea
---
That’s kinda what I mean though. Clearing stuff weekly isn’t easy in the sense of time, I see plenty of people falling off when progress has been made and it’s just farm and farm and farm.
---
Everyone rolling need is not the default. Rolling need on gear you intend to equip is the default.
---
Weapon skill gives an absurd dps increase against L63 mobs due to the way it affects hit chance and glancing blow damage.
---
Don't go prot to level, for any reason. Go arms and just use a sword and board if you need it. Prot is awful to level with
---
post your nickname so we can blacklist you
---
This has to be the most “retail bad” post I’ve ever seen, good God.
---
Don't even need a different expansion, just add Presence of Mind to a warlock. Dots *and* instant Soul Fire? Because fuck you.
---
and also dont really want to affli, since with destro´s crits i can get down mobs matter of seconds, even if not very mana efficient.
---
I'm not really into RP at all, but I do like to play dress up sometimes and Archeus fits nicely into that.
---
If you're gonna make a post like this at least block out the link. You're just giving them more free advertisement.
---
Identity issues are real.
---
I only remember a couple of people from my days playing WoW : WotL. I've looked their characters up but don't think it's them, they're at least not on the same server. Would've been cool to know how those guys are doing these days.
---
:O
---
Haha yep! If you die be prepared to run long time

Yes ofc he knows, but everybody else doesn't. They may not even know that they are buddies.

He's very protective over that Grave Moss.
---
28 is still very low for Arathi.
---
Check out Stonetalon Mountains or Southern Barrens and get 30/31.
---
if you're playing on a 70/30 realm.  let me know what you think in 3 months when they release the honor system and horde are camping outside every alliance hub and instance entrance.
---
If you think that's bad, imagine if they killed off Cairne Bloodhoof and replaced him with his son who nobody has ever heard of.
---
A lot of people speculated that they would be banned in China because of the panda conservation laws but afaik the only issue that they had with the race is the fact they were depicted in samurai armour in much of the promotional material and they didn't like that.

Chop off parts of the enemies lower body until they are the same height as you then stab them in the face!

Thanks. No where I searched has info like this. It’s always the same “tab sunder” stuff. And I don’t want to be the tank that cries because dps pull threat and refuse to tank. I want to keep up with the pace and this seems like a good option. I will try it when I get home.
---
Theirs a kid I used to quest with back in the day that I really wish I’d kept up with. Hydraxas server. His name was Kamikaze. Coolest little dude ever. I really want to start classic and see if he shows up somewhere.
---
The droprate for the meat is awful, did it while duo leveling and taking even longer. And ofc just when you need 1 more out of the 16 needed, the last turtle drops 2(!) just to rub it in...
---
I was gonna say, the moment you come across the opposing faction waiting for a mob on a PvP server, there’s gonna be a brawl
---
I would always buy BIS items over epic mount (Specially Edge which last so long). Why?
---
Mount cost is static. 
---
Edge is not. 
---
In a few months, Edge can either go down or go up, most likely up due to less people getting the drops. Mount wont change. 
---
While mount COULD help you increase your gold gain (If you got gathering), you spend most of your time in instances. 
---
I got my Archmage robe asap due to that reason.
---
from my point of view the shield is the only useful thing he does. i want mobs down ASAP and not wait 15-20 seconds while void decides to build agro that can hold my basic damage
---
if he is on alliance, he can do it easily.
---
Cast time would be Wirkungsdauer. Wirken in 1s is simply cast takes 1s. Don't try to mock something you don't fully understand.
---
Why not let people discuss the future? Stop gatekeeping cause you want to be special
---
Some of the enemies in Mechagon fit this description.
---
they will always be taken in raid because their blessing are just that good.
---
They are not very good in tanking, mediocre in dps (until they have good gear) and fantastic as healers
---
Funny how blizzard already confirmed they are looking at their options already. So something might very well happen.
---
True, but
---
A. That's so fucking rare
---
B. While you might dodge this incredibly rare occurance, you're also dodging a lot of your ability to actually pvp.
---
You strike me as the kind of person that probably doesn't know the difference between criticising something and shitting on it
---
Now repeat that process for not only your opinion but others aswell and just like that, we have BFA V2.
---
Why you need Spirit Tap if you already have Meditaion?  
---
Spirit Tap is a trap for priests, because it doesn't lead anywhere.  
---
You need to aim for something like this - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5052301310001-035050031300055
---
Same thing happend to me just when I hit ten after grinding and want my damn void walker
---
&gt; How am I just noticing for the first time 
---
because it's tiny and you can't see it
---
Yes, of course. Check the oldest comment.
---
Ashbringer represent!
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, I don't think people will stick around and endure that for very long.
---
You can't 'hold' aggro if you never had it in the first place. That's why you let the tanks generate some threat
---
For myself, my problem is that only demoralising shout hits more than 4 targets. Why do you need macros to do that? Does having it in a macro circumvent the global cool down?
---
Now you're making me think of rerolling from BS...  Engineering is the shit in pvp!
---
You sir haven't seen barrens chat
---
Don't. The thing is, we are on 1.2, not 1.0. Druids are MUCH MORE resilient that back then when MC and Onyxia were released. Also, players are much better than before. You could take a raid with the less optimized composition ever and still roll over the raid as long as everyone know what he has to do.
---
I honestly couldnt care less.
---
Druid could be any of 4 different "classes". What exactly do you want?
---
Would like all 3..
---
It depends on server size and faction balance. I believe those high/full population servers won't have any issues in the beginning.
---
I'd prefer the cross realm BGs as a last resort and only on those servers which it needs. It really breaks the immersion and kinda ruins the serverside pvp communities.
---
Typical horde player
---
Beg for your life. Maybe you’ll get off with just a polymorph.
---
what about the curse from the son of arugal which is about to kill you once a minute of five minutes?
---
Do you go around stating your intentions to need every item when you join a pug group? Or do you just do it and if someone in your group is playing the need/greed system straight, well fuck them.
---
Underrated? The pvp set basically gives you 7k hp.
---
What addon shows the energy regeneration bar like that?
---
feels like this for me as a hunter
---
I did some testing, and it seems to be Rank 1 of the spell that is the problem, if i use Rank 2 it works fine both on the boat and in contested zones.
---
Maybe I was unclear, the mage offered to pay me, but I refused it.
---
Just like the workplace, home, school.  :D
---
For instances? I understand if planning on doing stuff solo prot is terrible. Not suggesting they switch specs left and right but they said their stuck. Easy way out is to tank and have everyone do the damage for you.

---
Internet and forums are the echo chamber of hardcore (sometime hardcore wannabe) people. The reality is, pugs groups with green stuff roll over raids and don't give a shit about composition as long as it make sense.
---
Sounds like your pacing is off you can send him to the next mob while your still finishing one then he already has time to attack some. If that still doesn't work pull out the succubus to down the mobs faster so you take less hits.
---
I think most people don't understand how mage water and food works. By the time you learn a new rank of food/water you are 5+ levels higher than its minimum level. Meaning at level 30 you are still making min level 15 food when level 25 food is available at the vendor. This causes dumb people to think you're lazy and didn't train it.
---
If you attempt to loot the mob when you have full bags the loot is able to be picked up by your party member. By just running past the mob you're letting loot go to waste.
---
It is called Luftwaffe.
---
It simply means Air Force, or literally translated  "Air Weapon".
---
Oh, nice..I thought it would affect hit chance but wasnt for sure so those gloves are actually really nice, a noon would probably pawn it off for cheap
---
Tukui
---
As far as I know this is not possible to manipulate. I think you just got noggenfogged my man.
---
Just don't come complaining about the next phase can't come fast enough.
---
He's horde.
---
Totally worth. I got tired and bought mine for around 20s.
---
Had a lvl ?? Warrior dismount and charge our group yday, we were 3 ppl lvl 42-45. He didnt kill anyone before he died himself. Was a wierd experience lol
---
&gt;Min-maxing is fun though! Cooking food and crafting potions for small short buffs, getting gear with 3 higher stat from å chest. Running the perfect angle so the gankers chasing you pull aggro from a mob you safely pass.
---
This is fun min maxing. Saying to every player not being warriors/mage/priest to fuck off because they are useless isn't fun min maxing
---
See, this is why your being scummy. If someone actually plays it straight and greeds things they don't need, you don't mention it and actually try to make the system fair, you see it as an advantage. So don't go around saying that you're needing everything because it's "more fair" if you're willing to exploit people who are playing it straight.
---
Point out where I said anything about a bug or a change---Oh wait, that's impossible because my comment was entirely about someone acting smug and holier-than-thou despite being open about their apathy toward classic.
---
Take your strawman to a love hotel if you're so dependent on sucking it off to feel good about yourself.

---
It is for alliance, which horde can initiate PvP on. Like the op who is horde
---
Blizzard started enforcing the naming guidelines for RP servers. Your guild didn't just started to be reported. You've probably been reported since you made it.
---
I'd argue that pvping against people significantly lower level than you is far more pussy.
---
Never-ever fight with more than 2 mobs at same time.  
---
Actually it's never worth fighting even 2 mobs at the same time at all.  
---
P.S. For feral druid 16-20 is the hardest part. Go into starting location for dwarfs\humans and do green quests there. Your goal is to reach level 20 and get catform, that will speed-up your leveling a lot.
---
Are you sure you can read and find out he's horde based on context
---
I was all, "I'm gonna make some MONAAAY!" Then I realized that that was NOT the case, so now I drunk farm and have fun.
---
lmao that elevator death happened to me too xD

That ui though

---
WoW classic developer confirming BGs will use battlegroups. About the 12:20 mark.
---
The absolute best Blizzard could ever get is 60/40 populations with their battlegroups.  And thats including the Alliance heavy PvE servers into those groups.  How many of those guys do you think will be queing for BGs?  Hah
---
I'm still getting a couple of the "Can't find" errors.  
---
Such as [Auctioneer Wabang](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=auctioneer+wabang) and Unknown.
---
it probably translates to not enough time to design unique models for a trash city
---
Ashbringer server came up aday after initial launch, so i recon alot of casual people went there due to server ques maybe thats the answer why it took abit longer time on that server
---
Not true, a girl I know playing resto druid wants conjured water all the time too.
---
Remember to apply Might. Would’ve demolished him faster. Good job though.
---
Confirmed that they are thinking about it. Not that it will happen. We'll see.
---
Oh make sure you start with a 2H** for those big SS'd WW crits! Using this method will make you love your warrior again.
---
It's also nice to have engi leveled as you can then throw nades willy-nilly into every pack after the initial combo
---
I don't know about you, but I have wpvp'd my skeletal ass off.
---
What font is that?
---
Hell yes. Kinda quest I'm down for.
---
Did you know horde players can't start PvP against alliance in horde controlled zones? Because a lot of people are telling me that here
---
That's literally the one I just finished up after Redridge today. I even picked up cooking and leveled it to 50 because I could see the Chefs quest but couldn't initially figure out why I couldn't pick it up haha.
---
You can tank as Arms. You get Anger Management which is a huge boon for you, you do more damage so it's easier to hold threat, and you don't hit like a limp noodle. Revenge stun/last stand don't outweigh the benefits of the Arms tree early on
---
Came across a fellow rogue who was fighting low on health, jumped in and he immediately traded me these shoulders after because mine were crap. Feels good to be back after 13 years.

---
As a warrior Tank I like having my Druid mate heal me. The priests keep buffing shields on pull so I can go and run after and collect all the mobs that start attacking random party members. 
---
Taunt has like an arm length of range...Its hella frustrating to go for a pull only for someone to start damaging early and having a decent pull turn into a clusterfuck.
---
The whole thing is very obviously irony
---
Imagine thinking that Alliance players have any sense of what's going on

---
I'm curious what server you're playing on?
---
Southern barrens&gt;1k needles
---
Still works for me. Maybe you forgot to put a higher rank of the spell into your action bar to account for the target levels?
---
My best guess is that since you have such a large number of people that are familiar with each others classes that team work and communication becomes easier.
---
Go north from Loch Modan, follow road to Menethil Harbor, take north boat to Auberdin and run south. Follow road to Astranaar to open fly master.
---
Nope
---
Yes and no, there's such a thing as too much hit, however I don't believe that point is reachable.
---
There's basically 3 amounts of hit where hit loses value.
---
* Yellow Cap: This is when your yellow attacks will never miss
---
* Crit Cap: If you're no longer crit capped you don't gain as much value from hit (it's still a good stat though)
---
* Cap: Whenever you never miss on your white swings, after this there's no value of getting more hit.
---
Saved!
---
lmao you got owned
---
Yikes.
---
My wife and i are Brownchicken, Browncow, like a bass line from a 70s porn flick
---
yeah? that one snippy comment and now you're a psychic that can read my mind over the internet? nice man
---
I mean you can play anything even a ret paladin, if you find a guild that let's you do that, but Warrior tank is just much better.
---
Oh no, not the meanie word!
---
&gt; A. That's so fucking rare
---
Have you had any experience? Because in my experience there's nightmare fuel waiting for you inside Burning Steppes/Searing Gorge/Ungoro Crater and Tanaris.
---
It only takes you getting camped for an hour that you change stances
---
Uh oh
---
And you can go to Wowhead to ask where the guards are.
---
Thats a lie. All the rogues in every dungeon group ive been in so far chose one mob in the pull (preferably not the one the tank is attacking) and face tank 1v1 that mob until it is low enough to flee ans pull another pack of mobs....
---
&gt; How do I heal without drawing aggro?
---
You can't. Any heal will generate aggro equal to 50% of healed amount. That's tank job to generate more aggro than you.
---
i farmed in the dustbowl in the badlands for 4 levels on my hunter, im a skinner as well so as soon as i ran out of inventory i hearthed to IF emptied bags, filled arrows and then straight back to it, i started with 20g and by mid 40 i had enough, now i have to do the same for my skills :P
---
MoP was a bad expansion but not because of the setting. Those who claim Blizzard were copying Kung Fu Panda are morons. Pandaren had been a long requested playable race from fans ever since the WC3 days.
---
Nah, what made MoP awful was Ghostcrawler dumbing down talents and homogenising classes even further. It was also the era when the groundwork for the current awful raid system was introduced. LFR  (4.3, so technically end of Cataclysm) and Flex (5.4) led to the current overbearing split of difficulties. MoP also gave welfare gear generously in both Thunder Isle and the Timeless Isle, had insultingly easy heroics even by WotLK standards, abandoned Caraclysm's existing Justice and Valor Points system by the end of the first patch, had Hit and Expertise removed because they "weren't interesting stats" and had some of the worst writing out of any expansion. Garrosh Hellscream's character arc alone is a fucking mess.
---
Charge gets disabled once you enter combat.
---
Seems like you are too much used to classic and should stay there. Just level any class to level 60 that fits you.
---
So I took lvl 6 on my NE druid and immideatly departed via Death Road to Eastern Kingdoms. There I leveled in Elvyn forest and Westfall when a buddy of mine started fresh NE hunter. We met at Dolonaar and he complained that bag space is so scarce. I mentioned that in starter zones 1 6 slot bag droppers almost for everyone. And then 2 6 slot bags dropped in a row... for me xD
---
The voidwalker wasnt working for me due to above complaints, i do too much damage and thats how i enjoy playing.
---
I switched to succubus at lv23 and I am having a better time
---
CARE BEAR STARE
---
I'm an old player, I don't play for performance anymore, I just want to have fun with my toon :)
---
Thanks for the answers everyone!
---
I'm playing alliance on EU Golemagg, a server currently rocking a 2:1 horde:alliance ratio.
---
Arcane for...burst? What talent set up do you mean? Just that Arcane doesn't seem all that good in terms of damage output. What about arcane makes it worth bringing over frost or fire?
---
I love the challenge. It makes it more engaging. The rotations are simple but there is more you can do to maximize efficiency.
---
Wait people play on pve servers ?
---
Isn't it whoever clicks greed/need first gets priority or am I just making that up?
---
Had any experience? You mean playing vanilla 15 years ago and for the past 4 years on pservers?
---
so true. Im not sure if people just dont have "target of target" activated but its amazing how they all pick a different mob each time
---
Where in the rulebook is that rule?
---
Your target audience is not on reddit

Check chat setting. System must be enabled on the chat window you are right now.

command shift 4. If you press spacebar you can select the frame to print if you want to do a full print screen
---
Idea is that if Renew would heal the same second as first mob strike tank - healer will get aggo from all mobs in pack.  
---
It's good in the fight, but in first few seconds it may create issues.
---
Ohh boy, in 3-4 month you are going to be in troubleeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
I got the meat in 10 mins idk if i was luckY
---
I guess it makes more sense if it gets cut off. As you havnt reached competency yet.
---
It def should, maybe look up a tutorial too se if you're doing something wrong?
---
Time for a break I think. Come back with fresh energy.
---
That's probably more to do with the rise in popularity of cosplay at that time.
---
What zone should I be in after hitting level 20 as a horde rogue? Been in the barrens since 10- but the long walks are getting old!
---
Why are you respeccing your warlock?
---
Just go aff woth a few points in demo and maybe5 or 10 in destro
---
There's no reason to respec your lock. I am using the questing spec and I am absolutely wrecking in pvp situations.
---
I mean yeah you sheeped him giving him full hp he probably assumed you were a noob and wanted to test the theory...
---
Only complete if u call it by the correct vanilla name
---
His name offends me
---
Druid feels nice from 10 with bear form, but gets a lot better at lvl 20 when getting the cat form. The real gamechanger is lvl 30 and the talent fairy fire (feral).
---
For balance, i'd say moonkin form which is lvl 40.
---
Resto I'd say lvl 40 when you get the last talent, swiftmend.
---
&gt;  skinning/herbalism
---
Drop it. You won't earn any money from selling herbs\skins because players don't have money to spend on them.  
---
Pickup either Tailoring/Enchanting or Herbalist/Alchemy. Skills that would help you to play.
---
I would never accept a resto without improved windfury.
---
You kinda want SL for pvp, but ruin/sac for pve at 60
---
I'm lvl 48 so who knows what he was.. should know a sheep courtesy when u see it
---
Yeah that's what confused me. What's the point of priests if paladins can heal?
---
Sad
---
just start playing, ask players ingame if you have questions, or use wowhead
---
Ask me again around Thanksgiving.
---
I'm at about 280 too :(
---
The best place to farm turtle meat is actually thousand needles. There is a quest out there to collect a bunch of turtle shells, and you can get those and collect turtle meat at the same time. There are way more turtles there than hillsbrad.
---
Leave the guild. DKP and Loot Councils are simply retarded.
---
Wow the Ashenvale music is very different than I remember
---
Then you know it's a 30min corpse run to the entrance of any DM wing right? It's impossible to quest in Feralas. You cannot go Silithus near the mining deposits.
---
There is no reason to be in Burning Steppes or Searing Gorge as there will be horde all over the place.
---
I think it's easier for a NE hunter to hide than for a Human war, that also further establishes your opinion.
---
So do you want just a 5 man spec? How good are you at maximizing time out of the 5 second rule to regen mana? Spirit tap only gives you the buff if you get the killing blow so it's only really good if you are soloing or have a friend who will let you finish mobs off with wanding when leveling.
---
You can either go 14 in disc then full holy, or 30 in holy then disc. 14 in disc is easier on regen first especially if you don't find you aren't getting enough regen windows. Going the other route will give you more healing and you'll see worth in downranking quicker.
---
Never tempt RNGesus.
---
this is why i tank, its my group, its my way and if that rogue or mage or hunter doesnt listen then he's kicked and replaced in 5 mins.
---
im not healing until raids, im tanking for my healing pre bis.
---
....
---
That would be a great idea to stop ninjas imo
---
it reduces hit required from 9 to 8 for non orcs/humans for example. Also less dodges and parries which is huge
---
Literally 60% of the entire server LUL
---
i tell people im quitting the group if they dont hit the skull.  They listen pretty quick that way because nobody likes waiting 30mins to find a new tank

Fake casting a spell then stop real quick if you are playing against an interrupt class. Against classes who can't heal just play safe and kill them over time.

You did?

Either you don't understand, or me.  
---
What class? Do you want to play heal, tank, melee-dps and caster dps as a druid?  
---
Did you reached level 60? Or at least 40+?

You could always get good items from drops, so you should never worry about "missing" something.

10g max on a good day

Basically drain tanking is throwing on your dots and using drain life to out heal the damage you're taking for long enough to kill the mob.
---
A week ago I read that, according to lore, the mage food tastes like shit, which is why people eat regular food instead. So maybe he was RPing.... 🤔
---
More Stam = more HP = more lifetap = more Mana = Less downtime
---
Well I'm just speaking from my experience thus far, I see a lot of people mainly focusing on agil/str/int etc. My 40 rog had almost the same amount of hp as my 49 rog friend.

10s on the AH is not easily accessible?

---
Every single PvP realm is like 70% Horde
---
Does seem like a good system, the only way to get a boe to sell would be to greed if no one wanted to actually use it
---
Arms 2H tanking is great while leveling. The damage is a big part of your aggro. Also you just kill stuff faster this way. When you are prot while leveling you're SOL while you're in the world. Paladins are OP.
---
Yep.
---
something that came with ElvUI, not on right now so i cant look.
---
Yes that's what I thought at first. Wouldn't make sense
---
Paladin is amazing in pvp lol what are you talking about
---
Engineering.
---
Running sucks, but it's a really nice feeling to gather a bunch of quests, head out on adventure, do everything and then head back to town. Every two levels I hearth back to SW to train and then I plan my next adventure. Each one is like it's own chapter in my journey.
---
Another thing I used to hate was long quest chains. I wouldn't even read them, I just wanted to get them out of my log. But now I actually pay attention and think it's so cool to start a chain and travel all over the world putting the pieces together.
---
True to form, Balance druid not even mentioned at all.
---
Do it. you wont regret it. Community is way better.
---
A warrior does not need to spec into prot to tank dungeons. They also don't need a shield and can 2h if the rest of the group is good and if the healer has enough mana. It's generally better to use a shield imo, the huge armor gain plus the ability to block, and also shield bash for interrupt, makes the overall group much better.
---
Cost as much as training and mount included lol! It’s a long goal
---
At first I had no idea if I'd enjoy classic or not, its the only WoW "expansion" I've never played as I started playing mid BC, I thought people were being nostalgic and most of the player base would stop playing within a week or two, not only was I wrong, but but I'm actually enjoying classic myself a lot, it feels like a real RPG, the leveling feels like the end game.
---
Professions, gear, items feel like they matter, the game is actually hard, you fear enemies, you plan your attacks and watch where you're going so you don't die, you use potions, you use the auction house, you use your professions, everything feel like it matters. Remind me of D&amp;D and TES: Morrowind a lot.
---
I played Eve and WoW at about the same time in 2004-now.  I don't play much of either anymore due to real life, but I TOTALLY feel this.

(Yes, I still have active subs to both.  Skill training online, and signing in to level a character for the most recent expansion, or to say hi to the guild I have been in since BC are about all do these days, but I kinda like it that way.
---
paladins suck at tanking and are mediocre at most as DDs but they're almost as good as priests for healing
---
No, it's not. They aren't accurate for a number of reasons. The way the addons work makes them inaccurate. You get a rough reading based on when you're playing. It doesn't take into account alts, offline people, people playing multiple characters, ect. It's nowhere NEAR accurate in terms of actual population numbers and individual unique players. Blizzard is the only one with those numebrs. Census addons have NEVER been accurate in any version of the game, they're a rough estimate at best.

(/emote) taps his foot while rolling his eyes up... (/s) "Ret paladins are going to suddenly become insanely power. It has to do with /stopattack macros and blessing of sacrifice. Imagine a double reck bomb in less than 1 global... It's coming.

For now... I will let the chad warriors flex."
---
Holy shit, it's like you're me and I'm you! Even with a freaking skull up they just avoid it.
---
Sadly this is often the case when you think you can squeeze in an hour or two in the evening
---
LOL
---
Jormungandr.... You lost bro.? Hiding from Lawbringer?
---
Yeah, I tend to turn pet taunt on whenever things look dicey. And honestly I don't expect the tank or healer to keep it alive. Let it soak up some damage/pick up a rogue mob, and let me worry about it.
---
U want turtle meat go in shimering flats
---
I will fix those today, and then I can finally release a non test version :)
---
Silly Jaina, mages can't use axes of any sort. Better just get comfortable with that magic stick of yours.
---
Why didnt either of you need it?
---
No u just charge- auto-hamstring and repeat this until he used up all his mana on healing your autos. Then when oom you can go in and start kicking ass
---
As for warrior, yes it is true, at least for early levels tanking by dealing damage is more effective.
---
I've did most of my dungeons this way.
---
Have your upvote and get out
---
niceeee
---
Probably that if you’re running into these types of groups they’re likely a premade so their communication is already better than that of a normal pvp team.
---
Whole group decided to greed it.
---
Can you do this in Barrens? It feels like there are ALWAYS some quests there. You never leave that place...
---
it is done mate !!!!
---
He ignored me after the last message.   
---
I live for this shit!
---
the naga mages at the northern end of darkshore but your other places are as valid, it's 1% drop chance for all locations
---
It's on the slow side of normal but that's ok. You're probably on track to hit 60 at 8 or 9 days /played which is fine. Once you're at 60 you can quickly get up to 30 days /played and whatever it took to get to 60 become irrelevant.

Were you expecting to have your very own prot warrior pet?  He does really well for no investment at all.

You just can't shoot without ammo in the ammo slot, even if you have some in your bags.

Rolls a shaman
---
Statement about watriors is true, in early lvls its not necessary to be prot to tank, you can use a 2h weapon and such. But not the one abouy paladins lol wtf. Even if its only gor the buffs, they are worth bringing to a raid, and they are awesome in 1 target healing. Its true that from what I've heard everywhere (haven't seen it yet for myself as I'm not 60 yet), the consensus is thay they make poor dps  overall and basically are not a viable tank option in raids cause they have no taunt ability.
---
this is so accurate. I vividly remember, listening to Linkin Park - In pieces while questing in desolace. Ever since I hear the tune, I get vanilla vibes.
---
Classic+
---
Classic is great; it was when it was released. But there’s things I miss about retail, examples being a better map, the upgraded character info in the Character pane, all the guild stuff, etc. 
---
The biggest thing I’d like to see is something along the AQ Gate event, but for other upgrades we consider QoL changes to the game. Take the guild improvements: it could be added into the story *how* it came to be that the guild system got revamped; maybe some politics in there, and the population of every server has to come together to chip in towards helping the “Azerothian Guildmaster’s Association” orchestrate the logistics of bringing all those guild features online. 
---
I honestly want Retail WoW to get Classic-fied, and that’s the biggest thing missing in Retail; that feeling of being in an actual world where most of it is empty nothingness with barely anything to do, but with pockets of people here and there with all the bickering and pettiness that those different groups bring. 
---
With all the other content already done, they could add “world-sprucing” things in to the patches that were previously released and keep it fresh **&amp;** old.
---
It's funny because in TBC (I think, maybe it was WOTLK instead) they gave enhancement shaman that one skill that basically built up nature's swiftness points (like 20, 40, 60, 80, then 100% reduction cast time on your next nature spell) with each crit which added either a great bit of extra dps or let you pop off a quick heal and made pvp shaman that much better.

But it slowly increases to 50g pr respec. So if you raid once a week you have to spend 100g pr week in respecs
---
Is it the default font in ElvUI?
---
I mean it is a big part of the game tbh. Griefing like this normally leads to world pvp. Some pissed off opposing faction will rally some people - kill the MC'ing priest etc.
---
This isn't retail where players avoid conflict.
---
Have you tried reading the conversation? Or did you just rush to comment on the lack of context when context is not needed?
---
Nah, we're on Mograine
---
Played around 80hrs/week.
---
I know those are still rookie numbers to some of you, but I got high on warcrack. 😉
---
It is though, but nice try.
---
I suspect this is meant as "training AoE farming". Not training the ingame skills, but ones ability to use them properly.
---
45 is when you get the crit chance from fury.
---
well yes :D... no.. i was expecting that if its designed to tank it can hold aggro at least at the same level as hunters pet, while hunter tanked elite without any issue, my void lost aggro after few seconds.
---
Do any of the PvE servers have a good Horde community? I know people say Alliance tends to dominate PvE servers, and while I don't mind rolling Alliance I do have a fondness for the Horde.
---
Next they allow humans to be shamans. But only the fat ones.
---
lol my vw has no problems holding aggro, I think you're using him wrong
---
if you insta nuke the mob he won't hold, just like a normal tank but if you wait til the second taunt he's fine
---
Wow, never noticed that. Will check when I get the possibility!
---
I'll admit I haven't ru in a the numbers myself so you probably know more. Good to know!
---
I LOVED the singing hahaha
---
Spot on xD
---
I just did this for my friend I play with. I ended up getting it from the enchanters in duskwood on the second day when I was solo farming it during off hours. 
---
For horde, it can be rough. Friends help a lot. First night we farmed the tower and another warlock was there on the alliance and we just stole all his kills since there were 3 of us and 1 of him. 
---
Duskwood area sucks for respawns but seems nice and out of the way for most people.
---
Grouped with a warlock?
---
Pretty much expect that the warlock will 
---
1) take the most dmg in the group
---
2) deal the most dmg in the group
---
For the tank that means:
---
Yes, I will pull aggro.
---
For the healer that means:
---
Yes, I will take a lot of dmg.
---
For everyone, that means:
---
Faster, better dungeon runs.
---
Can't handle it?
---
Feel free to admit to me that you can't handle my awesome damage, and Ill just soulstone myself since you cant be bothered to heal me. Ill probably save my hearthstones for myself too.
---
Oh, if that still isnt enough I can just dot and wand the rest of the dungeon and we can just take longer to finish.
---
Yeah, that definitely makes for a smoother run.
---
Do you ever finish a quest but still have the quest item in your inventory?
---
Also why the greed has a gold coin is the symbol for it.
---
Funnily enough, when I first started playing wow I thought that greeding something would put up some of your gold because of that symbol.
---
We pretty much just do quest so no dungeons that's why I got spirit tap and wand as start to help until I could pick them up. Was it a bad idea and should I respec? I am level 30 now. Great then I will aim for that!
---
Hunter question regarding disengage + trap:
---
So I hit 20 yesterday on my hunter. I was looking forward to use disengage + trap or shadowmeld. However, disengage does not put me out of combat. I tried this with and without pet. Wit high and low aggro. Never worked. All macros I found aren’t working either. Do I have to wait till feign death for this trick? Is this a know bug?
---
that´s my point exactly, is basically useless for destro lock which has burst damage.
---
If i should always wait til he gets aggro (in that time i can take down 50-70% of the health of the mob) then if i sum it up while leveling it´s bunch of lost time and XP, especially when as i gain levels i do more and more criticals with immolate, shadowbolt, and other abilities.
---
I'm gonna get hate for saying this, but BFA feels like Runescape 3. Just terrible all around, and classic being Osrs, the much older but much more popular version of the game.
---
..................
---
Do you NEED this item? Then press NEED.
---
Do you want this item only out of GREED? Then press GREED.
---
How can this be confusing 🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂
---
You know you stop regenning spirit mana regen for 5 weconds after castkng a spell that costs mana? Meditation makes it so you always have 15% of it going. Inner focus makes your next spell cost 0 mana so it won't interrupt your spirit regen. That's why I usually go 14 disc first instead of 13. You can wait til your friend gets lower hp, then use a max rank heal with a renew right after, thrn stop casting. You want to wait as long as you can before you cast a spell that costs mana now, so ride out that renew and use inner focus to get a free max rank heal and keep on regenning.
---
Sometimes, but not since I started having this issue.
---
OSRS has polls where the majority of the community decide on changes
---
That’s not how he said it, but again, I didn’t downvote him
---
Yeah I agree. I mean I think BFA is even worse then rs3 they’re both really bad though lmao.
---
I've got a lvl 24 priest (leveling as holy because I'm a sadist) and a level 13 warrior (for the same reason).  Take your time, have fun.  This will never happen again, so enjoy it.
---
Could be. Could not be.
---
Let him go. He just wanted to trade some gear and get some food and drinks for the next adventure
---
Legit just did this quest a few hours ago and something similar happened. Waited 15m for our paladin to get there, horde arrived at the same time they rush in and die but kill 1 we got the other and then communicated in emotes to let them know we'd kill the one they killed and they would get the other lol. Was a pretty fun time. Could have killed them, could have helped them and they would have lived and left, but in the end it ended up how it did and it was pretty cool
---
Why all greed - just allows some one to ninja. Just all need, saves drama.
---
HELP:
---
Pick mining to go with engi and level to iron nades asap, total life changer. Herbing by itself doesn't make much at the start, gets way better at the 40+ level regions.
---
If you stick with tailoring, why not stay a tailor, you're making those epics and then profit from it later instead of dropping it? That seems like a massive waste.
---
Also, gnomish first and make all the BoPs, then drop it and relevel to goblin engi for the renewable rocket boots and sapper charges :)
---
I'd argue layers do far more damage than shit like this.
---
I'll be doing skinning and mining until I get close to 60. The whole time I will be saving cloths and random greens. When I switch to tailoring and enchanting it will be slightly easier and require less farming. 
---
Only thing that will suck is bag space... especially when soul shards come into play
---
Agree, this is his only usefulness
---
Gathering professions will be good for money selling the mats, but you won't get any benefits yourself. If you get a crafting one to go with you can get extra perks from them. It depends what your plan is later on?
---
Damn that music took me back.
---
How are druid heals in dungeons?
---
&gt;NEED or GREED?
---
&gt;So I chose the greed on all the items that I **needed**.
---
Punkrat has some nice class guides for classic and depending on how you want to play if your more lore and story inclined if not I’d get a quest addon like questie
---
Opener number  two should be faster. I don’t use rip that often really. Tigers fury is completely useless and a waste of energy. Don’t bother using that. 
---
I went to with feral aggression for the bite damage bonus, but improved stealth is also nice. Up to you really. The threat bonus helps if you wanna tank dungeons also. I kind of regret feral aggression, the bite damage bonus isn’t that big and I always end up tanking in every dungeon I do. I think feral druids are very underrated tanks. They feel great in 5 man content.
---
Tailoring/enchanting is always great for clothies. You could go all gathering, but since everyone told everyone to do that, leather is worth less than vendor price on my server. Everyone will tell you enchanting is a gold sink, and maybe it is, but its worth leveling.
---
Level 26 - what dungeon should I do?
---
what a dick xD
---
It depends what you want to get out of it, long term pairing a profession set eg. Tailor/ enchanting can give you an extra boost for equipped items and bags. If you want to make gold long term go with two gathering professions. Until the market settles  and becomes less saturated with materials I dont think you will make much money.
---
If yiu want to make easy money, it's probably true that you should go with two gathering proffesions, and you can forget skinning later and go alchemist. That sounds fine.
---
I myself usually just go with the ones I will be using in endgame, in the warlock case, it'd enchanting and tailoring or herbalism and alchemy.
---
Ffs op...
---
Not sure. Haven’t tried.
---
Wow, so angry.
---
If you can't find a guild to go along with how you want to play the game, maybe the problem is you and what you want to do. It is simply not fair to let druids take 3x the loot for their 3 sets of gear versus each class just looking for one set. It is also not okay to make a raid revolve around you.
---
Sniped Gut Ripper on a [100 roll](https://i.imgur.com/JydGAyd.jpg)
---
Needing on twink BoE's or any dungeon BoE to sell on the AH isn't how you make your pot of gold and it's a great way to earn yourself a shitty repuation on the server. We have a difference of opinion, IMO there is NEVER a good reason to ninja a drop no matter how much it sells for. You can tell yourself whatever you need to tell yourself to make you feel warm and fuzzy but in my book it's wrong and that will never change for me. I've twinked a lot, I had a shit load of gold on my retail account when that actually was an achievement and I never needed to ninja a BoE.
---
This isnt a hate on streamers thread. Nor is this relevant to the post.
---
I dont get, why is your beer not opened? 
---
You know you have to buff yourself IRL too right?
---
For single target yes. For dungeon trash clearing no.
---
Thanks, can't wait to try this out
---
i dont know dude
---
i play a warrior
---
You've convinced me. I deleted it. (No joke)
---
Hehe. Here's me as a warrior that got to pick it up on the first run. Will last me a few more levels before I get my WW axe.
---
good job
---
Dude in the middle just couldn't wait to start vaping until after the picture
---
You should be able to dot all the mobs but the one/two that are sheeped/sleeped.  Drain/nule the one that is the main dps target (marked with skull, or that the other dps are hitting...should be clear by the time you have the rest dotted).
---
If the tank is los(line of sight) pulling, wait until he hits the first target to start doting, and dot the one he hit first as a starting point.
---
If you notice the tank having trouble controlling the mobs (can be because he is fighting with another dps not attacking the right target, mobs that keep parrying him, all kinds of stuff) dot one less target early or nuke less etc.  Ease off the dps a bit and let him get control, then open up.  It might cost you some dps, but will smooth out the run and often make it faster in the long run.
---
Often on the loc I'll mention early in the run or before hand that I tend to life tap a lot and not to freak if I'm low hps.  Inbetween pulls if you are low burn a bandage/food to help the healer along as well.
---
How do I turn in the wailing caverns quests? I walk in and I don’t see anyone to turn it in to
---
We have abilities that drain our health for a reason too.....
---
Doesn't work though.  Only the person that opens the chest is eligible for the item and they can't masterloot it to anyone else.
---
So maybe not rose colored glasses?
---
What's the most effective way to train up new weapon skills? Can you grind it up on low level mobs or should you just deal with it not being as good for a while and continue questing as normal?
---
It was a bit to early for me, had to wait so it did not expire before the raid!
---
But I can assure you it’s empty now :)
---
I found out by accident yesterday you still do weapon damage while you’re in ghost wolf, too. Makes it that much more menacing
---
does reckoning do anything useful for tanks? i hardly ever see it proccing and when it does, it feels so underwhelming. i tried tanking for the first time, in uldaman and at the last boss we kept wiping because i couldn't get aggro on the adds fast enough.
---
is it worth respeccing out of reckoning so i can get consecration a bit faster?
---
I'm doing tailoring / skinning. Skinning for extra money while I level. Probably drop it for enchanting at 60.
---
You can make more money with those, yes. Don't know how much money warlock needs with their free mounts though. I used to have tailor/ench on my main lock back when I grinded the game, and I was very happy with the combo. Much more handy to be the one who produces your own 16 slot bags and enchants instead of asking them around.
---
For most other classes I'd def recommend skinning though, that just seems to be the best route in getting mount and later epic mount. But that's all it'll ever be, money.
---
Probably Blackfathom Deeps, Wailing Caverns, or Shadowfang Keep. Whichever you can get some level appropriate quests for.
---
Liberal or conservative I hate all western peoples
---
Just above the entrance to the caverns is a small cave with all the quest givers in it.
---
Yeah this, sell your Mac buy 2 pc with better spec
---
Damn I'd be salty after rolling a 99 first
---
People die slow enough that they have time to stand around wanding.
---
yeah, those guild names are also too good for this pic
---
You should AoE grind in HotW spec, though
---
Makes me want to sub my second wow account to make a horse on my server to just move them to alliance AH
---
Yeah! But when its not just you and you say at Lumbermill healing through the Fears its very useful.
---
The Warlock will most likely waste 2-3 casts trting to fear the healer.
---
how can you tell his ping from the picture? enlighten me please
---
If you use the 5 second rule. Only the tank remains at an acceptable health. The others will be ignored until necessary.
---
Early alliance zones are much more atmospheric and have overarching stories across multiple zones.  Like Westfall and Darkshore for example.  
---
Horde zones don't have that kind of worldbuilding in their questing.  By comparison, The Barrens just feels like a big area you do a bunch of shit in.  There is no overarching thing like the defias brotherhood.  
---
However, I think Horde has an easier time questing.  More of their hubs are straightforward and they don't have as many chains so not as much traveling back and forth.  Plus they have (imo) better quest hub locations in the center of most zones.  Things like Grom'Gol, Stonrad, and Mojache.  Plus Revantusk Village which is something alliance have no comparison to I don't think (a super high density quest hub in a 45+ zone, let alone anything comparable to the fishing pole or the rune of the guard captain).

10/10 engineering is the best profession for warriors, especially if you tank.

Arms 4 life
---
You need remorseless and imp gouge. I wouldn’t take sword spec as you’re not always gonna use swords, just the biggest/slowest right hand you can find and the fastest off hand. 
---
Also, imp SnD is pretty much just good for dungeons (situational while grinding). So I’d only take it if you plan on doing a lot of that.
---
It's a nice set but honestly I'm liking the SFK set more for the intellect and spirit stats.
---
Yeah haha. Always made me chuckle :p
---
- If you abuse life tap I will let you die

Booty Bay has the best collection of eccentric NPCs. First this guy that wants you to supply him drugs. The gnome that sends you all the way to Hinterlands to get his booze. Fucking "Sea Wolf" McKinley gets you to chase gambling addicts ask over the map to collect their debts.

At least you're not one of those who thinks Need is of if you "Need" the gold

Im a fan of animations and jokes of over aggressive tanks, but I dont like drawing lines between "old players" and "retail players". Its that kind of behaviour the drives away new players.

The text is a bit misleading. All it does it turn off your auto attack and lowers your threat.

It is, there is a reason you are locked to one faction on a PvP server.

Sorry I should have been more specific about my macros. It’s mainly for using an ability into a weapon swap so I don’t have as many buttons to push. It still has a global cooldown. Demo shout will be by itself I didn’t mean for it to sound like I wanted it in a macro.

I was just saying priests can survive a lot more. Not that this guy's scenario was survivable.
---
Try a shadow priest. I swear the Mind Blast is an undocumented Taunt button.
---
Tanking via big dick DPS is a very valid strat.
---
Just remember that as the tank you don't "Keep up". You're the Big Daddy, and you're the one who dictates the pace 
---
If being a little more careful is what you need to do, do it. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. You'll have better clear times on average if you aren't having to wait got rezes or healer mana after losing control of a pull you couldn't handle.
---
Warrior goes 2H tanking and can switch to shield if needed to, but usually doesn't have to.
---
They stay arms until like 58, around 52 you can start gathering prot gear.
---
Paladins depends on what you do, if you level through dungeons go prot (and a mage for water ;D). For questing retribution is solid. Haven't seen a retri tank actually as there is always an arms war or feral druid around.
---
Keen eye you have there, friend. I took this picture with my phone to make the meme to send to my homies, and then decided it might be relatable enough for the whole community. You are indeed looking directly at ya boi's monitor lol.

In the beginning of WoW that rolling system wasn’t even there :) You could either Roll or Pass, so people took to typing ”N” or ”G” in chat and if everyone was ”G”, everyone rolled, otherwise only the people who said ”N” would roll and the rest would pass :)
---
I'm 26 on my resto druid, I don't know about higher levels but right now I can easily heal. If your tank/group is good it's almost to easy. Drop a heal over time or two on the tank and anybody that has been accidentally pulling aggro, and then sit back and let your spirit recharge your mana.
---
I ran SFK 4 or 5 times yesterday, and on the last run I was so fully in auto pilot mode I mindlessly wandered into a room we hand't cleared and pulled everything. Didn't even realize I tapping the walk keys randomly as my attention was split between health bars (30%) and the tv (70%). It was the closest we came to wiping only because I didn't realize I was being attacked until I was &lt;50%, but tank got his aggro back and we were rolling afterwards.
---
But this guy speaks for all older folks didn't ya get the memo

Eh, for me, as I said, I like to figure things out mostly on my own. Ingame addons do too much hand holding in my opinion. This guide I can use as a referrence and then immerse myself in the game. I give it a glance and it tells me to go to X zone and do quests till X level. Like I said, thats just for me personally. Everyone is different.
---
As a Hunter..... oof :p

Yup along with the anxiety I get when I go to delete a quest item from a quest I did 20 levels ago smdh

It's a terrible screen shot for one of the worst BOE epics in the game. Could be the worst but I'd have to check a few others.

No, it doesn't. Probably an attempt to avoid the piano-playing one needs to do some of the more chad warrior stance-dancing moves.

Hey guys,

i wanna grind out my Enchanting to 300 the next days and im kinda struggling to find the right greens to disenchant for the right dust/essence.

Do you know any Addons that provide the possibilites of dust/essence from the targeted item?  
---
Or any site for that?
---
Dark Mode ftw :p

Because for leveling you dont need to be tanky. I rather have spirit and int to keep me grinding forever, than having more stamina for some low level PvP.
---
They're a druid. So they can shift out of it and continue to run circles around the warrior.

You can't expect to be stronger than a hunter and have a pet that also competes with theirs.

 The time has Come to settle alliance VS horde feud
---
Meet us in Hillsbrad tomorrow evening
---
I play alliance. Keep an eye out in trade

You really don't need to rush to hit 60 before P2. It shouldn't be too difficult even for casual players. For hardcore players on a good lvling class (ex. hunter, mage, druid, lock) you can hit 60 in a couple weeks of active game play and in under a week /played slower classes can do it in under 2 weeks /played. We're still months out from P2 by the time it drops the curve will be very nearly 60 and most casuals will be 40+
---
Well yes, but actually no

*The Barrens is the bane of my existence*
---
Its ok, you have ice block, ice barrier, slows, roots, blink.
---
No worries!
---
I'm old fashioned. If the tank dies, it's the healers fault. The healer dies, its the tanks fault. If the dps dies? It's their own damn fault. 
---
If I have some leftover mana they might get a rez. Or not.
---
“HUUHHH”
---
Damage is a better stat than stamina before rank 4 drain life, and it’s better after rank 4 drain life too.
---
Legit. I agree
---
I got banned there. 🤦🏼‍♂️
---
Play as 0/30/21 and never respecc
---
Hah maybe I should mate!
---
I made an Orc rogue. Leveled to 41 and ended up changing over to Alliance lol. Couldn't pass up a Dearf Rogue and I'm used to playing Alliance. I didnt regret Orc over Undead though. Orc looked cool and stun resist is amazing.
---
good screenshot
---
&gt; However, I think Horde has an easier time questing.
---
I agree with your assessment of things that make this easy, but disagree with it being easier, at least in regards to pvp servers.
---
Their 20ish zones are Hillsbrad (which is a 30 zone for alliance,) Ashenvale which is neutral grounds but a lot of quests alert the alliance as to where horde are, and Stonetalon which again, is an area alliance generally won't go to until they're higher level. Upper 20s/early 30s Dustwallow is a wash, 1k Needles will be harassed by alliance trying to get to Shimmering Flats. I'd rather have the flight path in Blasted Lands than Stonard for later, but that's a minor gripe. Alliance are positioned closer to everything end-game and access areas at a level typically higher than horde.
---
&gt; Plus Revantusk Village which is something alliance have no comparison to I don't think
---
Badlands is the equivalent for alliance, with the amount of Uldaman quests available I made it to 46 on my priest. Comes at an earlier phase but then you have all of Tanaris, what little there is to do in Hinterlands, right into Felwood/Ashara/Un'goro, then the PLs and Winterspring.
---
he admitted to having a bank full of devilsaur from exploiting layering on the count down to classic podcast. He should be banned imo
---
If you're leveling with a warrior friend, this is a great spec while leveling (the same one my priest friend is running now): [https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=priest&amp;t=vjvkvlvmvnwlwPwQwRwSvqvwvxvrvvvtvgvCvDvivfvEvFvGvHvuvUv9BfvQv0v1v2v3C8C9wgC\_C.C\~vRvXv5v6wXwYvTv\_v.v\~v-](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=priest&amp;t=vjvkvlvmvnwlwPwQwRwSvqvwvxvrvvvtvgvCvDvivfvEvFvGvHvuvUv9BfvQv0v1v2v3C8C9wgC_C.C~vRvXv5v6wXwYvTv_v.v~v-)
---
Wand spec and spirit tap are both great while leveling. You'll get 1000s of spirit tap procs and have something to entertain yourself (finishing off mobs) while questing. You'll save time not sitting. You'll save money on drinks. More than the 1g to respec.
---
You don't want an endgame PvE spec while leveling if it slows you own.
---
That goes for all until naxx. Even Naxxramas mechanics are quite easy in modern day because people were playing the original raids with 10 FPS. Something that probably won't fly in modern day mmo's (raiding at such low fps values).
---
Turns up DMX
---
In SM u at 34 you can solo the whole place, pickpocket mobs, take the chest and kill rare if it and that sums up some nice gold... As far as gnom goes, u can solo almost any mobs... Use sap if 2 are densed together, kite the other one back where you cleared, kill it and wait for the 2.nd one... Bosses are soloable with bandages and gauge, and pots (pots u pickpocket all the time)... There is a nice chest on the start quite easy to stealth there.. And the mobs are mostly gtren or barely yellow to me, so they miss and i parry a lot.. I get to use repost a lot... Im able to clear 3 4 mobs without eating to heal
---
He probably means a cleave setup. Stems from the warrior ability cleave. The idea is that you fill the group with classes that are good at cleaving, ie. hitting 2-3 targets at a time. You keep chain pulling 2-3 mobs at a time throughout the dungeon, only stopping long enough for the healer to drop combat so they can drink up while the group of warriors go to town on the next pair of mobs.
---
Spellcleave is the caster version. You stack the group with caster who have good aoe (ie. Mages) so you can do huuuuuge pulls. You will have downtime between every pull while the mages drink up, but the huge pulls more than make up for it.
---
The idea behind both of them is that you want to have good synergy in your group. 2 warriors, a rogue, a mage and a priest isn't really good synergy, as the warriors would like to chain pull instead of losing their rage, while the mage and priest have to take breaks all the time, so one part of the group is always waiting on the other. Results in a lot of downtime. In meleecleave, you completely get rid of downtime. The warriors can easily tank the mobs while the healer drinks. In spellcleave, you acknowledge the fact that you're gonna have downtime, so you compensate by killing 30 mobs at a time instead. And since you're kiting all the mobs with slow from blizzard and snares from nova, you don't need a traditional tank and can just grab an extra dps instead.
---
If they did the reset thing I wouldn't even play anymore. Horrible idea imo. It's better to let people reach max bis gear and all that and just let them decide if they want to make an alt. Everything I do for my character now would be meaningless if progress would reset.
---
That said, I think classic plus might be cool, however, I would want there to be pure servers where they leave it the way it is now. I would rather have no progression than my ability to play the real classic be taken away.
---
That's how I felt until i reached PvP areas.
---
It's great for when you pull aggro off your pet. But yeah, feign death is a better option for aggro resets.
---
Dodged a bullet, matrix style
---
The ‘everyone’s doing it so I may as well do it too’ argument about exploring layering is such trash. You are part of the problem
---
Typical alliance dogs.
---
U
---
You're the reason all priests I find are KOS.
---
I kill priests more often than I kill rogues.
---
I didn’t want to level as shadow, because I wasn’t going to play shadow, so farming SM was fun and fast. Forming groups didn’t take that long and the  runs were fast because I tried to do things in efficiency. At this level range, I’d probably just be camped in STV.
---
Yes, it is a retail thing that made it easier in dungeons and raids to see other mobs health.
---
Oh yeah, I don't personally mind it at all. BUT, I think it's the associations you get with the word (surely most people don't think, ah, just a countries air force) that could get you in trouble.
---
I'm not saying it's "fair" in any way, but I wouldn't be surprised the slightest if it was banned or flagged for a rename. Cus just with enough reports you get flagged.
---
Eh, by the end of Naxx pretty much everything was fleshed out.
---
The chosen one
---
Read the quest, go north to lake lordmere, fucking hundreds of snapjaws
---
Not for a priest =P
---
QQ moar emo man
---
Wow I'm sure you're fun to play with.  I assume you tax rogues, hunters, and dps warriors too.  Seems like something you would try to justify.
---
I love how you said it even after there was already a 99 roll.
---
I had a mage try to publicly shame me for not needing on the 11 int 5 spirit staff in BFD when I had the 7 int 7 stam 7 spirit staff while I was on my lock. I could have 'needed' on it and vendored it later but I was trying not to be a jerk. I am on a PvP server fwiw.
---
The potion is temporary, the playable Worgen later gain full control with the Scythe of Elune.
---
I'm down to record my clear paths, I'll upload them in a few days and post here if you want me to :).. In general you use distract and pickpocket a lot on the start.. U can solo the enterance mobs since they are far apart... There is a chest and a rare spawn aswell... Rare spawns are 50% and all drops are about 1g to vendor... Chest is always about a total of 75s-1g
---
Wait.. others are actually using Rip? The damage looks completely trash. 
---
I've just been using F-bite for my combo spender. I've used Tiger's Fury when I need to afk and auto attack something but I stopped ranking it and remove it from my bars a while ago. Ravage/FF/Rake/Shred/Claw/F-Bite here, with power shifting Furor/wolfshead helm.
---
Haha, awesome! Honestly I can see it in a good group where everyone knows what they're doing, I wouldn't mind giving it a go on my hunter, but in a PUG I would run a mile.
---
You chose to limit yourself.
---
i find stormwind to be harder to navigate than undercity personally
---
Yup on human female it made me drop my fine linen shirt.
---
SaTAN?
---
HotW druid represent!
---
&gt; I think it's easier for a NE hunter to hide than for a Human war, that also further establishes your opinion.
---
Yet it wasn't my experience when playing a paladin, priest or warlock either.
---
Fellow mages:
---
is it possible to make a macro which shows the tooltip of your next highest mana gem?
---
For example; if I have a mana jade and mana agate, my macro will show and use a mana jade. Once I use it, the macro shows the mana agate
---
I know I can do:
---
/use Mana Jade
---
/use Mana Agate
---
and it will use them if I have them, however the tooltip doesn't update and it only shows the Mana Jade (or whatever is on the top)
---
Help much appreciated
---
Back in the day there used to be a pop up about naming on RP servers but it stopped for some reason. The naming policy is definitely still in effect though and is listed in the ToS.
---
kurinnaxx!
---
yes and theoretically you also don't need a keyboard, that doesn't mean I'm gonna play WoW with just a mouse...
---
&gt; Your premade
---
That's assuming your not solo queuing or Wpvping then, relying on instants alone wont be enough to kill well-geared rogues/warrs, i'm not trying to sound nasty or anything just preparing you for the sheer agony of getting shutdown by said classes (did you ever see Swiftys first video? Watch his fight vs an ele shaman).
---
Thanks, I like getting a laugh out of the Horde every now and then
---
Seems pretty clear cut to me as it definitely references well known branding.
---
Had the exact same thought. Maybe a sort of drop down comment section thing so you only see it if you press it. That way it doesn't clutter the site
---
Looks like my hunter.
---
yeah that’s what happens
---
Real talk while were at it. Word to all warrior tanks. Please for the love of god use a ranged weapon. So many groups with a warrior facepulling or using thrown weapons. Please. Just use a gun/bow.
---
What addon do you use to show flight points on the world map?
---
Hahah
---
Honestly? Of course not...
---
Bloody dramatic dude. If it was seriously that bad, there are alternatives to declaring it unplayable =p like another questing hub or dungeon grouping. Geez
---
Bigs (Gnome Rogue) and Littles (Night Elf Warrior)
---
I was saying as a warrior tank I don't plan on running with shamans lol
---
I had someone the other night start like that then proceed to gradually overtake me. I assume it was something to do with our connections, she claimed its because I was wearing plate so was harder to carry.
---
gl clearing anything
---
I leave shit in the body if i notice an opposite faction skinning my kills but im also a peace of shit
---
Warlock at 42. 
---
That's when you get Death Coil and Howl of Terror
---
What if the tokens were a scam.
---
Anyone any tips for me leveling my 26 horde druid.... I feel like it's been a struggle so far
---
i have taken this into consideration, however i'm going to keep taking this at face value because i'm a brick wall.
---
Buyback tab at the vendor?
---
That's why DKP systems have attrition. People lose a percentage / half their hoard of DKP every week so it encourages them to spend it.
---
Yeah nothing ever actually happens. If it does it’s always a lame setup, lol - the mindset of uninteresting people.
---
Why would I? If they do their job I do my job. Your job is also creating water. So get over it.
---
As a GM of a semi-hardcore guild I can say proudly we will bring 1 tank druid as OT for our raids. DPS druid no, but beartank can work and is decent.
---
Respect my horde friend, if you can't beat them inflict as much damage at lest.
---
Abandon the quest and re do it
---
So you think the price of the Archmage robe will go up? I currently have the pattern and decided in an epic moint instead of the mats, and its about 300g on my server for the pattern and I intended to sell it and just get another serviceable robe as a mage.
---
If your attacking the correct target (all dps should be on 1 if it's a traditional tank and spank group) and your not pulling aggro in the first 10-15 seconds in the fight, it's probably that someone else is causing the problem...making the tank try and split his agro or pulling to early making the tank play catchup.  If it's later in the fight and it's constant (every pull) you might assume your tank is under geared/lvled etc and need to slow down a bit, but it isn't usually a big deal as long as it isn't you pulling the wrong mob off him or pulling early before he starts getting hit etc.
---
Had a tank today who would pull another pack when there was only one mlb left of the current pack.
---
"Omg I died, stop wanding and heal dude"
---
Or one shadobolt that crits.

Great story 😁.

Hi Leshraque

you cannot dispel magic effect. so gl ;)

Haha so true i can relate, only google it up when i m fed up after 30 minutes or so of running around
---
Ask a guard
---
Buyback tab has been refreshed (I assume from a logout), it's just empty now
---
You were complaining about an epic drop? Sounds like you didn’t deserve it.
---
Just corruption agony and 2 wand hits and they are on my ass...
---
Print screen is for big boys that want their questions answered
---
Got one of these while farming yetis in Feralas, was excited until I saw 3 up on the AH for 22g. Decided to just keep it for now and see if it goes up eventually, or just use it on an alt at some point. I guess it makes sense with all the aoe farming runs, high pop server (Herod), and low amounts of gold people have in general, plus no twinking yet.
---
Then sorry, abandon &amp; redo
---
Moisturize me!
---
Say. My. Name.
---
You're entirely correct, I apologize. Must've mixed some other posts into yours.
---
Let me guess,  you're a hunter?
---
So you wouldn’t accept the second best horde side healers over a talent that basically increases melee dps by 7 and yes that spread over 3 melee groups is a whopping 84 dps in total. Not to even mention most of the tier is caster dominant atm also so that’s even less. Hahaha
---
Yeah, try again OP.
---
Just drop it.
---
What addon is the one showing the group?
---
Still the person with the dead baby of course. The other guy is just heartless.
---
Druid Raid Officers Represent! I was an Officer in the guild back in vanilla.
---
Yup this whole thread is a fucking joke lol. OP is probably trash and the leader didn't want to tell him so he blamed the class to make him feel better. Imagine playing a druid and whining about how hard your life is lol. Just shows how noob he is.
---
Fair enough. I have no insight in programming at all. Any chance the default per page can be higher then? 5 seems fairly low imo.
---
No it's ok I like being outnumbered. More horde to gank.

Hehe not my video ;)

I was doing this same quest a couple of days ago. I was only lv42 at the time, and had to kill two lv50 dragons. I decided to grind the whelps nearby and look out for a party to do the quest together. It was quiet because it was still early in the morning. But suddenly I noticed a lv?? Tauren Hunter killing the two dragons. I decided to help him, hoping I would be able to communicate to him that I needed his help. In the end, he almost died, so without my help he couldn't have made it, which I believe probably made him more willing to help me out. With a ton of emotes /pointing /questioning (and /begging) he gestured to/wait. Together we braved the elite dragons and got our sweet rewards. Truly the best experience I've had so far.
---
It's hilarious to me that he was trying to discredit Jokerd's world first 60 by saying it wasn't really legit because of layer abuse, yet he has been doing the most shady shit with layers and collusion. What a grade A fucking scumbag.
---
How much farming does that mount take?
---
Sell it and buy Axe of the Deep Woods.
---
Hunter top dps, must be fake.
---
That's not a thing in classic. It was a bug in private servers but it didn't carry over to Blizz's version.
---
Lmao.  There was an elite in Wetlands about 2 weeks ago, and my party had 2 in it.  Theirs had 2 as well and they refused to group for the elite.  We cleared a mob in front of the elite, and they tried to side pull the elite to tag it but pulled more mobs instead.  While they were fighting, I grabbed the elite and killed it.  
---
One of the 2 from their party msgd me told me I had terrible etiquette and would be blacklisted on the server/server discord.  
---
People are ridiculous.  They could have just grouped #1 and #2 THEY tried to pull it from us first but aggrod mobs.
---
Jesus fucking christ
---
It was a good time
---
You gotta progress, can't be stuck doing the same shit for 10 years
---
Engi is huge dps boost for melee classes with them nades.
---
Tried to do a Stocks run the other day. We had a warrior tank, 3 melee dps and a Pally healer. Instantly the tank pulled the entire first hallway as we were buffing/prepping. We survived and asked him to wait a minute. 
---
He then did the same thing (healer was pretty much oom) and of course we wiped. He made some snarky comment about needing heals and the healer got pissed and left. I apologized to him later on and he was a good sport, just said he didn’t like the tank. 
---
As we were waiting for a replacement healer we told the tank to chill out a bit with the pulls and at the very least make sure everyone was ready. He responded “lol k”. 
---
After about 2 minutes he said something like, “ok I’m out. You guys clearly can’t handle this instance, I’ll find a new group” and then left. 
---
Some people are just stupid. Or they’ve been playing retail or other MMOs where you can beat dungeons in 5 minutes flat. This is the first time it’s happened to me in classic but I’m sure it won’t be the last. All you can do is start a blacklist. /shrug
---
I bet people take photos of their screens now using their phone on purpose rather than just being unaware of the Prt Scr key.
---
As a Warlock, I thank you..
---
So  far I have never had an issue with warrior while playing my rogue. They all were easy to deal with. Too easy
---
I concur it's going to change post 40 when they have plate (Im lvl 29)
---
You can't sell quest items lol
---
There was a free transfer?
---
I love when you get into a really intense battle with some luckier than usual self-healing mob.
---
I would say keep it until bgs start, but I don’t really think there’s much twinks that run around with shields, but I’m sure someone out there would want a tank twink so if I was you.. I would hold onto it..
---
This... This is almost not fake!
---
The problem with this is that it puts a stress on the start of the servers. Classic servers were meant as a time capsule and yet there is a period of a couple of months that are unique and will never return (unless reset, which won't happen - at least not for a looooooooooong time). I kinda forces people to play NOW to experience the whole packaga rather than joining whenever without missing unique phases that are - compared to the eternal time capsule - pretty short lived.
---
That said, I do believe it to be for the better.
---
&gt;Why are you using nameplates?  I never found a need for them in vanilla wow and certainly not in classic now.
---
It's more about what are you used to. I come from retail enviroment, nameplates are super importnant source of many informations for me. It also worked on Classic couple of weeks now I really got used to it and now its giga hard to get unused.
---
Nameplate indicates which mobs (names) are where, which are drop Q items/are Qslain, if i have DoT uptime on every target, which target DoTs are ticking out, when I generate too much threat on which target, cast bars of enemy targets and many, many more useful information is provided just by that piece of thick line.
---
Yes it is, unless he's got a weapon with higher damage in his MH (unlikely at 26, cruel barb is just THAT good) he's losing out on damage by having it equipped in the OH slot.
---
Balsy
---
Then people downvote me for being deceived? Fascinating logic.
---
Are you sure? That's not how master looting out of a chest normally works
---
I don't think that's how it works but ok man lol
---
Deposit your items in the bank. Abandon quest. Re-accept quest. Get items from bank.
---
I was a hunter in vanilla and used this macro or a very similar one. It worked maybe 80% of the time.
---
Depends only on class AFAIK
---
Dunno man,portals need reagents i get that but paying for free food seems off. i am glad you are getting tips though
---
Just flex outside IF AH!
---
No that wasnt my post I was just reading through and didnt get what was wrong :)
---
Bout tree fiddy
---
In dungeons, the tank's job will be to think about generating enough aggro against all the mobs (if not CC'd) to keep them off the healer. A warrior tank might use bloodrage, demo shout, battle shout, thunderclap, and single target sunder armor (for example) or taunt if needed in order to keep mobs off the healer.
---
Pick up groups when questing usually won't have a dedicated tank and will be a bit more of a mess, it's expected. You can try asking the highest dps to try to peel them off you. Also make use of range to give it time to walk to you without hurting you. Waiting a bit before healing anyone much can also help (let them build up threat). Fade and even a careful psychic scream can work (but shouldn't be needed on every pull).
---
You missed his point. Curse of Recklessness will remove the fear. It has everything to do with the player not the class. If you get a bad roll just use the curse and all of a sudden the mob comes back you can Curse of agony and refear. Its like saying all rogues are gonna ninja your gear. Its just a blanket statement you hide behind.
---
Same here my man, let's walk to DM together in P2! I'll bring my invis pots and FAPs :V
---
ahhh I got the pun, lol. 10/10
---
Golemagg-EU-PVP, having an absolute blast. People grouping for quest, even helping each other in quests they don't have themselves. If I meet toxic people, tell em off and leave them be. Not worth the effort and risk.
---
Just because you had a bad experience it doesn't mean all the other thousands of people represent a shit community.

You're still right tho

I like to whisper people way ahead of me and tell them to turn around.

Good luck and hopefully it works right for others as it sounds to not always be this way.

You can always just "/join world" and look for a guild.

Damned alliance! Always vandalizing tables everywhere they go!

Does anyone know if shamans’ weapon enchants stack with their enchant totems? For example, could you put Flametongue on your weapon, the put down a Windfury Totem and get the benefit of both? Or are they mutually exclusive?

---
Leveling quickly/efficiently is more than just dealing as much damage as possible. If things are hitting you because you're immediately pulling aggro off of your pet that means you have less life to Lifetap and regain mana with, meaning you're probably having to stop and eat/drink to recover more often. If you're eating more often then you're wasting more gold on food and wasting time not killing things.

The controls look so fluid and seamless.

For me it usually goes like this: as a warrior, i was fighting 1 mob and got to low health.

2 alliance players who knew i was in a group suddenly swooped in and finished me.

I gather the cavalry from the whole dammn zone.

Some innocent alliance playsrs might have died in the process of securing the questing zone:D

Women only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting.
---
they obviously have to know what they're doing but once they have Whirlwind Axe or Bonebiter they'll hit hard.
---
Wand/mind blast adds running away in fear is how I did it. Or just last hitting mobs with wand in general, it’s not that hard in low level ones if you’re consistently trying.
---
Can't wait for Molten Core!

This is why i don't grind like everyone else. They miss out on quests, reputations, flight points, professions, pvp, and most of all.. memories

The addon that contributes that is either SexyMap or Leatrix Maps. My buddy dumped a whole list of em on me.

Confirmed, the stats per level is independant of race, only the base stats are affected by race.

Class trainer won't teach me Holy Nova (rank 1) but he has rank 2. How do I learn rank 1?

10th PSA on healers bitching about warlocks lifetapping because they have no clue on how to heal
---
Not necessarily related to classic wow, but does anyone have any recommendations to YouTubers or streamers who are doing there first play through or a beginners guide kind of walkthrough? Feeling lost when playing and seeing all streamers level 60 doing endgame stuff.
---
You had to ruin a decent post by using "your" instead of "you're", you just had to.
---
honestly, it take a few minutes to grind weapon training. Just find a few mobs and hit them with the weapon and that's all
---
What a surprise
---
apparently so, the same 5 meme templates with herod helm slapped on it is acceptable though
---
Voidwalker only has one use.
---
And that's sacrifice
---
They do not.
---
Sharing Sagefish ponds?
---
Because they sort of are. If you get attacked first, you die to almost everything. Good mage, warlock or druid is, without engineering, almost guaranteed loss.
---
Bloody brilliant. No one wants us Shemmies to heal, but druids can do it all. My best wailing caverns run was next to a druid healer.
---
Any On-Use item that is equipped will have a 30 sec CD before you are able to use it. That's the short cooldown you are seeing.

Trying to sound smart on reddit, gotta be empty as hell, this is actually hilarious, and no, you have no actual knowledge of how layers work. go on photoshop, might hep you as an example.
---
So many people running away so I can't taunt.
---
Do DPS really not know that Taunt is melee range?
---
PSA:  Taunt is MELEE RANGE!  IF you run, your gonna DIE tired.
---
You had me in the first half. Then you mentioned balance like it exists
---
Go into dungeon groups with as near to empty bags as you can. Loot grey stuff, particularly weapons and plate pieces. Between vendoring trash and quest rewards I didn't need I was able to make 60 gold from 38 to 44.

It's a Holy talent.

In both videos you use hoj while you have bof on you. That's an instant poly to reset the fight/force your bubble. It's not rocket science.

Low effort content should be removed

I have an old one I use like a doorstop!
---
I have a chance to get invited to a raid while being a feral dps druid (Discount rogue) without having to beg my guild to do so? I seriously don't like being a healer, too much pressure
---
With regards to the price, you're going to have to try and find out by yourself. The economy is not yet mature enough for prices to stick
---
If you're willing to put in a lot of effort to farm bags of crowd pummeler then you should be fine
---
I understand that, is there diminishing returns past 305? Would a normal pair of plate gauntlets be superior over 312?

Cast bars have stopped working for me. Worked fine before the patch the other day.

You need to be level 7 or something don't you?
---
True, Westfall and redridge have to be the two worst zones.

I feel called out
---
Not sure if you are intentionally being ironic?
---
I'm not alone!
---
Its what I imagine PvP to be, and yet its mainly skulls ganking lower levels 😊
---
Especially when the tank is capable of pulling more. Had a run where the tank was food, but wanted to play safe. Healing done was so low that run. As a healer, I like being put on my toes.
---
Remind me of that level 20 combat rogue I was doing WC with. The guy had a crappy 9 dps main sword. Stinging Viper drops (15 dps, 2.80 speed mace) and nobody needs, including him. 
---

Why would you level as fire though :o

Oh that's awesome! I'll save this for future fury'ing thanks buddy
---
Plate is heavy, of course. What is this "connection" you speak of?
---
Well you’d be wrong
---
Is disc priest underrated?
---
I did this spec and tanked dungeons until completing my pre raid bis.  Now that I pretty much am done with dungeons, I went a bit deeper in resto for the bonus healing, rejuv bonus, etc.
---
Also 1/29/21 for the papers.  Natures Grasp is essential when dueling melee classes.
---
Years ago i played alliance. Last week I started playing classic again with a few friendy, who wanted to play Horde. Now I'm a Cow but I'm happy with it, it's nice to see All the places I've never seen, do quests I've never done! Have fun people
---
no problem. Healing changes a lot when you get plus healing gear and the 25% of spirit as healing talent, you can pm me if you want to talk about healing more.
---
A Doctor Who reference. Bravo.

Nice dude, I always thought about getting all my childhood games put on a sleeve of some type. Haters gonna hate. Only thing that matters is you're happy
---
“About 2 weeks ago”
---
You mean launch? Lol
---
I play on the US servers but a few add-ons that I use are Titan bar, it adds info about location gold, bag space and much more with additional plugs. Recount, it's a DPS meter very easy to use. Questie, it will add ! To your maps and help direct you. Bagnon, makes your bags more accessible and easier to adjust.  Deadly boss Mods (DBM) which informs you or bosses and their moves. Atlas loot, gives you maps and loot of all dungeons/raids/crafting and more in the game. Lastly is Auctioneer which allows you to post/scan and in general control the auction house in much more detail.
---
laughs in steel weapon chain
---
Yup, and I knew this would happen with the whole /#NoChanges movement that, imo, weakened the potential of classic
---
If there's no class balance changes, then you know that mages will be the best, so why bother inviting someone who's not a mage/why bother making a non-mage. =&gt; People realized that everyone only wants mages, so they reroll to mage.
---
um yeah but what about the MURLOC HEADS in Hillsbrad? Ridiculous.
---
What about 42069 :O
---
Well, hard to tell for sure, but I think it might be snuff.
---
I install manually, but I use the twitch app to keep things updated. Mostly because it seems unable to figure out what mods are for classic and what aren’t.
---
for leveling quests with friends
---
I still have my figure print of my vanilla nelf tank from when they first started selling them, she sits on my desk ready to spring in to action!
---
Snuff, snus, like under the lip tobacco. I guess.
---
Maybe a gold. There have been a ton of these things on my server and sometimes they sell for even under a gold at times.
---
Yeah, what’s up with that. I started out as Horde but rerolled Alliance after a while, lvl 40 now. My realm has a lot more horde players. I hate being the dominant faction. I always join the underdog team. I kill every Horde on sight, if it’s red it’s dead, and don’t feel bad about it, you deserve it when choosing to play on the overpopulated faction. I will corpse camp you until you log out and start crying. I will dedicate my gaming time    just to make your questing experience as horde as shitty as possible.
---
Nop
---
that's it buddy only way out is to delete this character
---
73 yetis later....
---
Im interested to see what the realm will look like when layers are gone. Org gonna be so crowded.
---
I love pally tanks, 3 mages and me.
---
I've seen a lot of this so far. Even when I'm just asking to join *their* group and I can tell there's only 2 or 3 of them. I'll buff them, help them kill a mob or 2 while asking if I can join their group but most people won't respond. It's frustrating af.
---
For regular questing and stuff i would go with dps tank and shadow priest.
---
Otherwise disciplin build in priest is pretty good. Remember to go for the increased wand dmg with first skills 🙂
---
Really? I got mine in about 5 kills but I always hear that other people had a hugely bad time with it. 
---
My worst was the peasant skulls. How in the fuck do they not have skulls.

I’m gonna instantly downvote any of this crap

---
Best way to level solo is combat swords.
---
Sure it's anecdotal but I've had a solid 2-3 pummelers per lockout-cap (5 runs). Not nearly as tedious as some make it out to be.
---
Lol u would not wanna be in kirtonos barrens/org  chat.. definitely alt right trump spam all day. As a mixed middle aged Male that leans right on immigration but left on abortion/lgbt, I can definitely say it's a lot to take in sometimes lmao. I dunno why people (even if I agree with them sometimes) have to spout off about politics in a mmorpg. I play to escape irl and have fun, but some of these mongrels just play to push their agenda. Oddly enough I never see any lefties/libs in chat. Only far far alt right.
---
The true reason why horde is superior to alliance: we don't have to deal with murlocs until lvl 30+.
---
I prefer it. Being in a group with mages is just demoralising. They're in every scenario and all they do is use either 1 spell (Frostbolt), or 2 spells (Cone of Cold / Blizzard)
---
I'm on Atiesh too, and I have had the best time. Everyone is super courteous buff trading, handing out free water unprovoked, even horde helping me kill mobs that I've already tagged in the zone we're both questing in. Just feels like everyone coming together to have a good time!
---
Before leveling a NE to overtake your human, if you're doing PvE, take a look at that +5 to swords/maces. It's +3% hit on bosses and also boosts white attack damage on glancing blows (which are 40% of all white hits) from being 60% to being 85%. Non-humans may be pigeonholed into lower priority on swords/maces in 40 mans, if that matters to you (while humans might not get the other weapons first). Mentioning this mostly because you've already leveled your human &amp; just cause it's good to know (I rolled dwarf warrior anyway).
---
Hunters are great farmers, night elves look nice with a bow (and get a little extra base agility), and most of the nice ranged weapons are bows anyway instead of guns. Maybe a night elf hunter. (If not a hunter, maybe a rogue.)
---
Don't forget the more intellect you have the faster you learn weapon skill so make sure to have whatever buffs you can get like AI from mages or GOTW from Druids.
---
I'm a bit tired but I tried some quick mafs:
---
Don't have concrete numbers but cat and bear form (as an example) costs 55% of base mana (I'll be using those, but travel form costs 20% of base mana for reference). A druid at 60 (if the numbers from wowwiki is correct, which I believe it is) have 1244 base mana.
---
This brings the mana cost to shapeshift into a cat to a rough ~ 684 mana. 30% off from that is ~ 205 mana. Making the new cost 479 mana.
---
Using my own [druid](https://i.imgur.com/UTAvZnH.png) in off-spec feral from actual classic (I believe I was running HotW at the time, though since I can't confirm the numbers are just speculatory, would need an actual 60 druid to confirm) I had about 3229 mana.
---
This means without natural shapeshifter at that point in time I could shapeshift a total of ~ 4 times (3229 / 684 = 4,7), assuming that is all I do and no other spells are involved. 
---
With NS and no HotW I'd have 2584 mana (3229 * 0,2 = 645,8 &amp; 3229 - 645 = 2584 -- Not sure if the game rounds up, so I rounded down in my calculations.) Which would allow me to shapeshift ~ 5 times (2584 / 479 = 5,3)
---
With natural shapeshifter and HotW (though at sacrifice of 8 talent points in resto talents) I could shapeshift a total of ~6 times ((684 - 205) / 3229 = 6,7), or 4 times and still have 820 mana (205 * 4 = 820) left over for whatever.
---
As said I'm a bit tired but I think my math is correct (in hindsight, somewhere went wrong as 820 mana left-over would only allow one shapeshift extra at 479 mana per cast.
---
Eitherway I wouldn't suggest natural shapeshifter for PvE purposes over HotW, and if you want to shapeshift often in PvP going for both HotW and NS and sacrifice some of the healing ability would probably be the best to get the full worth out of it.
---
Looks like xperl, but might not work for classic. Shadowed Unit Frames maybe?
---
I actually had to check what sub I was in
---
If you’re horde, these sell higher on the goblin AH than your own. Particularly once people get to 60 and have a bit of disposable income.
---
iirc 2 attack power = 1 strength.
---
Spend several minutes making water to save several seconds drinking. Makes sense.

You could say it's blizzard's fault that those players started playing WoW in the first place

Good thing u went at 20 and not like 17 18

You want to be closer to the last boss level
---
And keybind the raid marks to something like f1 for skull etc
---
What are you taking about youd wear triprunner from gnomer...
---
The thing is, there is no real point. these arent real upgrades, all they do is unlock the next raid and then what? You have the same item that gives a niche effect that is useless anywhere else.
---
tuned differently = wrong

molten core in private servers is harder than classic because its tuned to be harder this also means its wrong

If you type the right word, you'll join the official blizzard channel

oh shit I see it now. I never identified the flames as eyes. it always looked some woman chanting from a book lol
---
Class fantasy and optimal are not the same.
---
I could stand in fire and keep casting on a mage. I got the same right to heals as a lock spamming themselves dead?
---
Life tap isnt the issue. I guarantee this kid is whining because he hits it multiple times to go from no mana to full. Because really, if he is using it properly a healer is never really going to notice, much less do anymore than keep a hot up, to heal him.

How can I get the twitch desktop app to correctly sync my addons?  My laptop will not prompt me any way to "addon sync".  Thank you :o

Why didnt you want it? That's a lot of int. Unless you pvp more than you quest I can't see why. Ot upgrade?
---
It's an awful weapon.

Yeah we’ll see, if that’s the case then well played. Classic is a good distraction.

Bloodsail Buccaneers unite!

Not had anything happen like that on our server before, actually. Hell, back when I was levelling in Ashenvale there were dwarves and humans I tag team assisted with demon slaying.... we all just were friendly together, even had a picnic.

Hmm maybe I should snipe some purples and ride up that sweet inflation curve.

Warriors are easy to gear quickly into pre-raid BiS because you just tank and mention up front that you're main spec rolling for dps gear because that's what you need to raid. Rogues are a bit slower unless you've got friends that can heal and tank and feed you your share of gear. Raid gear is slow for everybody but tanks, as everybody's BiS is mostly the same cloth, leather, and weapons for a while. Warriors also can gear a bit faster than rogues because they can take a single 2 hander for 2H fury, to help speed up gearing the rogues and DW fury types, which want two 1h each, and because they can soak up good mail and plate drops too (assuming a mage-heavy raid composition, without many hunters).
---
Rogues are much more fun in world PvP. If that's your thing, be a rogue.
---
As a new player, I don’t get it

The legendary Über Stick! Will defend you, heal, attack with power of the poo-stick and also will make you a quite decent blowjob. I heard it drops from Thrall.

You know, those vibes

In order to get a certain enchant on the legs (I don't remember which one), you had to do the enchant on a higher level character. You couldn't do it through the trade window so you had to have a pair of BoE pants and not BoP.

Me and a friend are planning on making a few friends at 60 and running dungeons together regularly. The plan is to get a feral druid (possibly found one already) to tank. Shaman healer (For the Horde!) and another none optimal spec to join my BM Hunter and his Warlock. Reason: To allow people that want to try something different a place to do just that.

Tired of people begging for water and not giving me anything. I currently make 2 good water at a time and it's time consuming. So I give them my shittier water I can make 20x at a time of. Had a lock complain about not getting the good water lol. Like dude if you want my good water give me a healthstone or a buff or something.

Considering I am the guild leader and will be forming our raid team, I am going to stack the roster in the favor of me and my friends. Is that fucked up? Maybe.

I really hope that there will be twinks in wow classic as I'm am looking forward in making a 19 rogue, 29 rogue, 39 shaman and 39 warlock. And yes I am buying twink bis some to keep some to resell. But so far after asking around not many ppl know about twinks and I've seen some twink items for really low price in AH but cant buy them as I'm always buying something and am constantly skint :). Also I want a few hunters in different brackets but will have to quit my job, divorce and move somewhere in the mountains where no one will bother me :))

Is Druid healer good for PvP? I was planning to play a mage, but I heard there are tons of them, so I would like to roll a healer that also can PvP.
---
Yeah I saw 3 tauren druids wearing the exact same clothes, Thinguno, Thingdos, Thingtres. Dos and Tres were on auto follow on uno.
---
I did
---
haha took me a couple hours to find enough. Lots of people doing the quest, hordes ganking and low droprate!
---
As a caster, buy a wand. Most people (idiots like past-me from 10 years ago) playing for the first time ignore wands. They really up your dps and make leveling much more enjoyable.
---
Full of just enough laxative to get your bowels really flowing. Nothing like a deathly-urgent shit to get the party started.
---
I prioritize stam over anything as a warlock on a PvP realm. So far I have been never 1v1'd (also deep demo with VW). I have 1.5k hp as a lvl 32 warlock, and I can double sac voidwalkers for 2x1100 shields. Gl dealing 4k dmg through fear spam, before my dots rot you down.
---
Its not reliable enough to justify a hunter staying in melee to use it, think about it:
---
Either do what you do best and stay at range spamming Multishot for consistent dps, or melee at massively reduced dps like a pleb hoping for the tiny % chance to blade storm at the perfect time (if your group is efficient enough then mob packs will be dying quickly anyway which means by the time you get your proc your over-killing and thus its a waste)
---
Ok so it’s in there :) I only had a level 1 lock running to Org from the starting area
---
I think this is a per server thing. I see a lot of people saying World PvP rarely happens, but as an Alliance in EU-Shazzrah I can assure you that's not the case. We are massively out numbered by Horde and they love to fight. Luckily I love world PvP so I enjoy it, but I know a few in our guild have quit over it.
---
did you screenshot my warrior? lol
---
Don't let him ruin what you enjoy. He knows nothing about druid tanking in patch 1.12 and is just repeating old uninformed nonsense. Look for Skarm's videos. He played extensively both, druid &amp; war, and is explaining how both can tank and while some encounters are easier for war, it doesn't mean druid can't tank there... And there are encounters where druid is even better
---
I believe it's mainly because it reduces the amount of damage you lose when you strike a glancing blow, and that caps out at 310ish. In otherwords if you have 310 weapon skill you will lose the absolute minimum amount of damage every time your attack is a glancing blow, which certainly adds up over an encounter. (Plus the extra reduced miss / parry / dodge / block chance)
---
Wat.
---
There is no competing, no honor system yet, no battle grounds, no achievement. We are literally in a block of time set by blizzard for leveling and the first raid.

Yeah as a BM Hunter I have so much HP it's funny watching people get shredded by my pet trying to get through my hp if they catch me.
---
Dont knock it till you try it
---
This. Yelling "bubble me! Bubble me!" So i can safely hellfire then getting the bubble as the pack dies is the most frustrating thing ive experienced playing warlock. Close second is the fact that everyone thinks they can charge me extra for services like lockpicking etc because "I dont have to pay for a 40 mount"
---
I hate this kind of overused meme but fuck this made me laugh lol. prob because i love druids so much even tho never mained one
---
Make a youtube video

But somehow it was just really fun.

IDK my lvl 60 friend boosted me through SM earlier, got 75k/hour..
---
Dungeons are your best friend!!! Get a sword and board and get some exp that way until you can start a new zone !

If you're starting on a fresh character, going through zones in the end prob skinning. Herb later on.

1K is my favorite zone once again, and all I'm see is people complaining about it on my server?!
---
Welcome to 2 weeks ago.

More stamina = more life tap = more spells = more damage
---
It's effectively a sprint for classes without sprint and a second sprint for rogues. Allows flag runners a better opportunity at making it down tunnel or to prevent caps in AB.
---
It's a battleground toy and you'll see its importance when they release.
---
I did the same for the pristine tiger fang in stv!
---
Newbie here, con someone explain what they did and why it’s bad, i’m not sure I understand 
---
cheers
---
It really is becoming a “I just looted this drop brb posting to Reddit” k bye.
---
To add to the answer you already have, Warriors are the only class that can use every weapon type available.
---
&gt;Really? 
---
Really, I've been there for like a whole day, I don't mind grinding, I actually like it while I listen to music or else, but all the time the same freaking cave was exhausting
---
God damn it, take the updoot
---
Whats the point of pve at all? Beat the hardest boss. What's the point of all the leveling, grinding, and getting BiS before that? Getting yourself able to beat the hardest boss. You can call it trivial but that's the game man, at least from a raider perspective. 
---
 Those were just some quick ideas for adding a new and exciting final goal/boss without just raising stat numbers etc. too high. I love the idea of resistances to open new raid tiers, then who knows, maybe a big final T4 or even T5 raid that requires resist gear from all previous raids. After that who knows, but there's years of content right there without drastically upsetting things like xpacs do. I'm sure the actual idea will be better but that seems like a good possible route to me.
---
I got the srenght version of that , might be using it at 60 xD
---
I do that from time to time if it's a caster so I can keep it CCd (in otherwords prevent it from casting spells), but at least I use crippling poison in my off hand to help the issue of running enemies, so can I at least get a bonus point?
---
Where would be the best place for a 36 to farm silk and mageweave? I only have 46g and 4 levels to go for mount, so hoping to get my tailoring up to sell bags.

Gotta cuddle that gryphon or you get slow speed.
---
because 1.12 talents are vastly different than 1.4 (first MC clear)
---
It's a folder in your Pokedex
---
Can't be poly'd/ blind ! See a mage casting it on you hit that sucker off and you're golden
---
&gt;Or keep hitting something after pulling aggro.
---
I feel like this is a common misconception. If a dps pulls aggro on a single mob, I'd rather they stay on that mob. I can taunt/mocking blow/concuss the one you're on- or let you face tank it because most classes can probably handle a single mob while it gets nuked. 
---
I had a rogue in SM who was higher level and would open up the minute a pack got close to me. Then, after pulling threat on 1 mob, he'd jump to the next and pull that one, then the next. 
---
If I'm trying to AoE tank 3+ mobs and you just keep jumping around and not picking one to kill, we're just gonna end up in a situation where you're tanking everything and I have no rage. 
---
And yes, I did mark a skull target, but this guy was too busy doing leet deeps to worry about that.
---
5 damage doesn’t scale well at all at lower levels, the stamina boots may actually be more meta for warlocks
---
Dracarys also gives borders
---
You didn't play vanilla if you don't get it. It's just a part of the experience, every class has their way to fuck with others, it's just a part of the game. Would love to see you end up in one of the old xbox lobbies lmao. You kids these days would have an anxiety attack lmao.
---
I'm leveling one for the first time and everyone says it's a slow grind and hard to do but after 30 the pace picks up and it's worth it at 60. Hang in there
---
I’ve seen some warriors on twitch having a proc text appear like revenge or execute etc is this an addon or some in game settings?
---
You are so good please teach us
---
I’ve been thinking about rolling a druid to switch up with my main warlock. Tauren druid looks very nice to me but I have no experience with it. 
---
What roles do you mainly fill in early dungeons? I know raiding is mostly healing but I’ve heard getting accepted into dungeons can be hard because some only want mages and locks as dps and warriors as tanks.
---
How would you know what class halls were like? You said yourself you didn't even play legion. Imagine having a strong opinion on something you have 0 clue about.
---
man you really have no idea what you are talking about lol. go inform yourself more, looks like a 2005 post
---
At 50-60
---
Never missed leg day...
---
Go back to retail then
---
What am I supposed to see here?
---
It doesn't matter that much what race you take. You can do your job perfectly fine with any tank.
---
Prot isn't bad, it is just not needed while leveling. Especially at the beginning you should invest points into the weapon tree for rage generation purposes.
---
Alliance got better looking zones at least.
---
Hillsbrad?
---
Edgemaster's are BiS for non-humans/orcs throughout classic. They're BiS for human/orc until C'Thun's gloves unless you're not using swords/axes. Don't just equip them before you even start raiding - you might get a mace like Ironfoe, who knows? And that's a lot of gold. They're still good for humans, but significant diminishing returns on weapon skill (the effective hit rating and the glancing blow damage increase) kick in at 308 weapon skill and it puts you at 312, while you're naturally at 305, so they're more important for other races. Equip them if you want BiS at any cost, sell them if you want the gold and the freedom to put on any other gloves, such as the less expensive Devilsaur set and raid epics.
---
What is considered the best leveling spec for paladins post level 30? Is it to switch to tank and try to AoE grind from then on? Is that even a thing in vanilla?
---
#nochanges
---
By the time I finished securing the lines I was using a vendor bow with more than 50% higher damage (per second) than the hickory. 
---
By the time WC groups were starting to form I was spending my time in 1k needles and didn't feel like going back there.
---
Tauren for the hp. Orc for +hit but can be made up with gear. Either way it's negligible.
---
Not SexyMap. That's only for costumizing the minimap.
---
well if noone would care why do i get this question 5 times a day. Whining? what is whining about posting answer to a question that i get a lot ingame. I bet you concluded that from the title and from the answers.
---
I feel you, but those are the people that probably are not suited for this game. Don't let your spirit get dragged down mate
---
If you wanted a serious answer, the night elf exclusive weapons are bows and polearms.
---
private servers had it wrong yes, it was 100x harder lmao.
---
shield block is enough to never get crushed. defense is a terrible strat. any good healing group is able to heal this kind of damage easily
---
I think it should be the other way around
---
Why are you sitting in there by yourself?
---
Well, at last for me the voidwalker get the aggro, but is a little bit hard.
---
Basicly:
---
1- You can do one wand hit to pull the mob and lure him into a safe spot to the voidwalker tank, or if you feel confortable (and has no other mob close) you can send the voidwalker to tank.
---
2- is the dot time, use your dots but the ignite MUST BE the last one to cast because the intial burst damage of the spell.
---
3- attack the mob with your wand until he die.
---
At last this works very well to me.
---
free food / water, good single target, good CC, good AoE. They're all-rounders that can cover anything that comes out of left field or just speed up the run in general. But it's not exactly a necessity, just nice to have.
---
retail bad classic good
---
8/10 asdak eh ya3ny?
---
I think tauren,  because of the bonus HP.
---
Are there any minimal/sleek UIs that you know of that don't look "modern" like this?
---
Like I really like the health bars and stuff and clean action bars but like the fonts/colors/gradients are so non-WoW that it ruins my immersion.
---
Try having a conversation under water. Can’t hear *shit* then you drown.
---
&gt; I only played during TBC.
---
??? Doubt
---
The whole point of The Good Samaritan story is always so missed.  The term is used to incorrectly.  In the story a Jewish guy is dying on the side of the road, and a bunch of wealthy people/other Jews walk past and don’t help, then a Samaritan does stop and actually helps him a ton.  The key there is that it’s a person who is culturally your enemy helping you.   It would be like a maga hat wearing guy dying on the street and a Latino helps him out.   Just doing a random good deed doesn’t make you a Good Samaritan.  A Good Samaritan would be more of an Alliance member rushing in to save you from mobs or something. 
---
Also in this case it kinda works, because the healer more represents the rich people/Jews who just walked right past lol.
---
Because hurt feelings, mostly.
---
I had the same problems as a hunter leveling as marksmanship. Can't complain about his aggro if you're not specced for it.
---
No, a second, hidden roll occurs and the winner gets decided.
---
Neat, but nothing to do with Classic wow.
---
Alphabet decides the tie winner
---
Didn't need help obviously, he camped him for 3 hrs
---
2 alliance mages lvl 60 were camping hillsbrad on shazz eu. They were 2v1'd by a lvl 49 shaman. Multiple times. Camped even. 
---
I think it's just that mages are the new "noob class". Every idiot is playing one after seeing all the streams and videos of good players doing awesome things.
---
Thank god I am a warlock, and will counter any pleb mages in PvP.
---
They do get oom in long fights, just like basically any caster that doesn’t have life tap/evocation
---
You can still get ahead of the curve, stack up on consumables/items you know people will use for certain things in later phases, or even a month from now when the average player hits 60 - and you can make bank doing that
---
During raids, you have to balance your mana usage with buffs so that you're at 0 mana only after your evocation is back up. Basically, if you want to deal top damage you drink mana potions and use dark runes on cooldown (and when you've lost enough mana) and then hope to reach 0 mana by the time evocation is off cd again. If you cant do it by throwing max rank frost bolts, you need to downrank your frostbolt to a rank, where you're able to do the above mentioned. Then if you don't want to/cant chug down potions/runes, you have to start by downranking so that your rotation with evocation allows it. You can also use your wand at times, but its often not good damage at max levels for classes other than priests.
---
mounted combat looks pretty rad tbh
---
Remindme! 5 hours
---
r/unexpectedOujia
---
Someone led me there
---
Oh I see it, like the eyes are her arms?
---
Check neav UI on wow interface, in the comments for it someone has started updating it for classic (few posts down there's the GitHub link to DL it)
---
Afaik Troll for berserking to maximize threat per second.
---
That's correct. I prefer not to die though :)
---
True classic or classic expansions.
---
Ughed I got so discouraged leveling a shaman knowing the fact I'll just be a heal bot Instead of a white damage king
---
When is the good time to start going into dungeons and which ones? Level 16 mage currently.
---
I'm enjoying tanking in arms while leveling. The 5% parry is way better than anything at the top of the prot tree. Anger management is +1 rage every three seconds, and you can stance dance into defensive after charging. And of course you're going to get a 2h damage boost and mortal strike. Good all around. Just throw on a shield and defensive stance in instances.
---
If my dad would have kept playing. I would have been horde for 15 years. We started off as NElf druids. Then he quit when I left home to go to school in 2013. Roommate played WoW so we started new toons and I played a Human Pally. He died in a car accident, I got depressed and deleted my paladin. Stopped for a year, and picked it up when a new friend who wanted to play. I started a Blood elf paladin. Got tired of that, race changed my NElf to a troll. Got tired of that. Created an undead priest who has been my main ever since. Created an orc shaman just to play every healer except monks. Life got good again, met the love of my. I rolled a Human priest for Classic. Alliance were my happy years. Horde were my miserable years.
---
BuT tHeY dId ThE mAtH
---
That's the problem though - people are so hyper-focused on min/max and simcraft that anything that's not optimal is left by the wayside, even though sub-optimal is still viable.
---
Usually at level 20 I jump into Wailing Caverns to get the crescent staff. 20 DPS staff quest item.
---
 Yes it might seems weird for warrior to use a staff that has intellect on it but the DPS on the weapon is the most important stat.
---
Dungeons are also nice because you are the only mail user on horde so you have alot of gear for yourself. Dungeons are important to do as a warrior because warrior needs to stay up to date with gear.
---
If you want to help out the guild the most, a tank or healer is generally most useful. If you roll shammy you’ll likely heal in a raid. Enh can be quite fun in wpvp, windfury crits are great. I’d say ele is more consistent but hey whatever you enjoy is what you should go with. 
---
Warrior in solo wpvp is one of the weaker classes in my experience. Very easy to be kited to death.
---
Please stop assuming that every little change is an intentional decision by blizzard to ruin your life.
---
They've had to rebuild a 15 year old game. Bugs are bound to exist. Report them as such and save your nerdrage for when Blizzard comes out and confir,m that the changes are intentional.
---
It's used as a CC breaker too, don't forget. Very useful in WPvP/duels as well as BGs.
---
Yeah, vw is pretty useless for soloing/questing. The real shit is drain tanking with the succ out.
---
Alright boys. You know what to do. When he lands, we jump him. That'll teach him a lesson.
---
Note: Auto shot shoots in half a second, then has a (modified weapon time)-0.5 second cooldown.
---
Damn that's awesome
---
That's just your wand damage
---
If you ever see Mercuie on Fairbanks Alliance I'll always stop to make you food or water for free if you ask!
---
Pfft sounds like the words of some lesser gnome or elf, or perhaps you're just horde scum to be cleansed and your lands salted. If you can't be touched by holy light like we Paladins, then there can be no innocence, but only degrees of guilt.
---
Ok thanks again for the answer, I´m sorry for asking so many questions but I would really appreciate if you could you please help me choose which talent tree between those 3 to go:

It's not about nostalgia, it's about people needing downgrades that may be an upgrade to someone else simply because they want the appearance (that they'll likely never use).
---
Huh? They're an RFK drop.
---
I’m not even worried. Im
---
Gonna roll through all these people
---
Who think they are good because they leveled fast once the BGs drop.
---
Well, you keep it in offhand for duels and swap it out when it's on cooldown.
---
It breaks cc like sheep, sap, gouge, blind etc for the low low cost of mana and hp per second
---
Fucking nailed it. Especially about Blizzard fucking it up. Let's just leave it as is and enjoy it for years!
---
Here are some more macros. 
---
 [https://github.com/Meridaw/Classic-macros](https://github.com/Meridaw/Classic-macros)
---
I just held off two levels and did it while doing The Shimmering Flats quests, highly recommend.
---
That's the most contrived lore nonsense ever.
---
I only find this frustrating when I am drinking and the lock could be eating instead of waiting on the heal. 99% of the time I just trickle a renew on a warlock.
---
Just my thoughts but bad warlocks life tap when they actually run out of mana and not routinely as and when they can. It's then worse for both the healer and warlock.
---
Get the fuck back in here now.
---
Try spinning, thats a good trick
---
Rogues can lockpit right?
---
I must be doing this wrong. I give 50% of the price it’d be for me to buy that level water from the vendor myself. Which is 14s/5waters at Max...
---
So just use that stuff 4head
---
update: shit rules
---
&gt;i only put 3 or 4 on ignore so far. fuck off back to the pve containment servers.
---
Probably because everyone else has you on ignore already.
---
I'm doing half-half now. For the first 46 levels I did only the occasional dungeon, maybe a dozen instance runs in total. Then I discovered three-mage-ZF :)
---
But doing only that is terribly boring and you miss out on the epic questing in, say, Searing Gorge.
---
I don't use combination macros like what you're describing as I'd rather press a few extra buttons than give up control of my behaviour (often I'll want to hold off on the first autoshot until my pet has had some time to approach my target), but have you verified that your add-on is predicting your first auto-shot accurately? 
---
I find it often gets confused when I take multiple actions too quickly, but my autoshots fire regardless (as revealed by audio, combat log, floating combat text, and the arrow animation - the firing animation often does not display correctly).
---
Paladin at level 4, and you have both a seal and judgement. That's all you're gonna use for the next 56 levels.
---
I’ve bought out several reagents from the AH and some have already tripled in price over the last 10 days. I expect to be a rich man in 2 months.
---
Yeah exactly
---
Grab your tower and one monitor and move it out there!
---
Hidden reroll
---
Giving 0 shits?
---
I'm not leveling very fast for the amount of time played, but really enjoying exploring new areas
---
Fuck asmongold
---
James actually has a new leveling guide for classic used with the wo-pro add-on to give you an experience like questie. It starts at level thirty but the exp/hr is better than dungeon grinding if you're efficient.
---
Let people do what *they* want with *their* classic experience. No amount of wanting or wishing is ever going to make this actual 2004. The game is ancient now. So many people know it inside and out and have a different perspective on what they want to do with their time here. Why do you care how others play as long as they aren't being dicks or breaking rules?
---
Worth 15 g on our server. Whatever
---
Hey man. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything. It was very insightful and now i know where i need to improve on and what i need to do. 
---
One more question. If i want to do some farming post 60 and heal dungeons for bis, should i stay shadow spec or should i respec to full holy for healing dungeons.
---
Like if i stay shadow spec am i still able to heal post 60 content?
---
The flight master is south, it's down. Bats hang upside down. 
---
Ez
---
Yeah I was thinking of the whole "weight" issue, too, and of the implication for survivable fall distance :)
---
I think this is me - Yojamba? xD Literally said this to a dude not too long ago.
---
show don't tell.
---
Something modern entertainment has forgotten.
---
You're a warrior just grind every mob in your path
---
Imagine levelling fast because you are enjoying every moment playing.
---
Nah thats crazy
---
Wash people are playing the game they want to 8nstesd of the way I want.  They are stupid and dumb waah
---
This was an awesome read! Thanks
---
Haha i remember back in tbc.. me, a lvl 60 + something mage, made fun of a lvl 68 mage because my hp and mana was so much higher than his.
---
He then asked me *yeah but what about your spellpower*
---
Me, only wearing '...of the eagle' gear: *wait thats important?*
---
He ran off doing the /chuckle emote.
---
That's when i changed my gameplay...and attitude.
---
Quill18 has a let's play on leveling a druid.
---
Hello guys! First time wow player here and I am Lv27 combat swords rogue.
---
I was wondering if anyone could help me some insight with my weapon progression for my off-hand sword?
---
Think you're reflecting on your own personality there buddy.
---
&gt; I noticed an Alliance priest trying to do the same to Horde memebers on the same boat as me and he could not either.
---
What is "undead"?
---
Heirloom items were added later and universally disliked because they trivialize leveling and making finding loot in the world meaningless. He made his guild name Heirloom Vendor to mess with our fragile hearts because Blizzard adding this back in would be a huge blow to our trust in their ability to keep the classic experience pure.
---
Just save the quest until you go to dalaran. There are better turtles there aswell
---
Man the upgrade at level 38 is real! New ranks of Drain Life, CoA, and SL make drain tanking a breeze now
---
Wow 100 dollars. Well that ain’t gonna happen. Seems like gold farming could pay well yea hehe
---
Hidden rerolls until someone wins
---
&gt; Im Gonna roll through all these people Who think they are good because they leveled fast once the BGs drop.
---
Good luck with that
---
I can't look right now.. Just look up a guide for arms warrior specting follow it. There's about 15 years of theory crafting for every single class and you should have no issue finding a good spec to follow.
---
Have you considered playing some single player games? Sounds like the “MMO” part of “MMORPG” isn’t up your alley.
---
I love taking the FPs in shadow form and having the person behind me inhaling my shadow farts the whole way
---
I'm curious what score you would get if you took an iq test.
---
Not a chance!
---
i have never had a bad time with the helculars rod however aged gorilla sinew is a diffrent story
---
Well I guess it's a good thing I don't play on a popular server. People can't be picky.
---
Thanks.
---
I bring them to 1% hp when they're in a fight and then watch.
---
They blow all their cds for that one mob and on the next one I do the same thing and they die
---
Your highest threat ability is sunder armor. In addition you have a few tools for aoe threat: thunderclap, demo shout, battle shout, and bloodrage all do a little aoe threat and can help at the start of a pull. If you're trying to generate threat, sunder armor. If there's multiple targets, tab sunder. If you've got all the threat you need and extra rage, you can rend and heroic strike and cleave and add dps. HS and cleave make you skip a white attack and generate less rage, making them more of a rage dump, a way to add a little dps. Rend does no extra threat but adds a little dps. Sunder does a lot of extra threat and doesn't consume the white attack.
---
He would kill you in a heartbeat more than likely if he was your level or higher. Stinky horde. D:
---
Yes.
---
I have a lot of more good memories with situations like this rather than killing epic 40 man  bosses with guildies
---
Being stuck in the trenches of a timbermaw den or a felsworn cave with another dude, grinding it out - no homo, ccing, using shitty consumables, hands sweating and then looting the quest item
---
That is what it is all about, and why retail doesnt appeal to me
---
Blast wave is the coolest spell a mage had too imo. Once I'm geared I plan on going 24/27 fire/frost for some elemental action!
---
Warriors are the same way, luckily for me my main leveling partner is a priest so we are always in dungeons together. We tell people at the very beginning “if you pull by yourself or attack something besides the skull (I use a macro and always have the kill target marked) I won’t taunt off you and he won’t heal you”. It normally happens once per group then everyone learns and the dungeon flys by.
---
Some people still think you can pull half the dungeon and kill everything like some level 60 Wrath twiks can
---
There are three guilds on my server "Yojamba"
---
Blood and Thunder
---
Strength and Honor
---
Victory or Death
---
Reminds me of ICC when "bears = bad" was spread everywhere because of the dodge debuff, but while paladins and warriors were dropped to around 0 dodge and basically were eating or blocking everything, bears still had 20+ dodge and massive health pools.
---
I just feel like most people who have never played bear just don't understand the spec and parrot every bit of misinformation that they read from someone else who is also misinformed.
---
AND redpilled.
---
Hillsbrad deso dustwallow alterac arathi shimmering
---
And dungeons mainly sm gnomer uldaman
---
If there is one thing we know about this playerbase, it's that they will find a workaround to any obstacle put in front of them. For this one? Threads/groups asking people not on the server  to roll level 1's of the faction they don't want so they can unlock the faction they do want. Which leads to faction imbalance despite the "fix" as one faction will be taken up by unplayed and forgotten level 1 Alts.
---
no?
---
Not so sure I would say priest is "better". I love shammy, it was my 2nd ever character and my main for all of vanilla/tbc/lk period. They are incredibly versatile and just so much FUN to play. Yes strictly in raid environment priest is more efficient, but even so, every raid will need your totems at least, so you won't be left out. As for pvp, a SKILLED resto shammy can turn the tide in any encounter.
---
Damn you - now I want to play the shaman even more!!!
---
Patience.Discipline.
---
Yes. Problem is finding available spots for AoE grind.
---
Shield slam &gt; revenge &gt; then heroic strike spam.
---
Sometimes you just want to grind. Thanks for showing us the best places to “grind on” for max satisfaction!
---
Is this a quest or a bug lol
---
why are you telling me something i already know?
---
I say 15 months.
---
How much did you make?
---
Amen.
---
For the horde.
---
no the big one protec
---
Classic expansions, just till woltk, no more.
---
Just a bug my mate recorded from his perspective, on my side I was completely normal
---
Whos pissing and moaning besides you?
---
This is great, thanks!
---
You could mail conjured items? I don’t remember this but also never tried.
---
17-18 for Alliance. Deadmines in Westfall.
---
14 for Horde. Ragefire Chasm in Orgrimmar and then 19 for Wailing Caverns in the Barrens.
---
how the tables have turned
---
Mankrik, horde. Cheapest on the AH right now is 99s a few more a little over a gold. I've sometimes seen 10 up on the AH and then usually selling around 70s - 90s.
---
woah, not cool
---
When can you properly start drain tanking? Am lvl 18 now. For now it seems like it's the usual dot and Wand to get things done
---
I play tank. I'm always party leader. I've never booted a healer in my life. If you boot a healer you're just an idiot. You can easily run dungeons as 4dps+heals but 4dps+tank or 5dps good fuckint luck.
---
I tried but, at least initially, can’t find a way to make it work. I haven’t encounter ally enough yet to try it though (before I die to them lol.)   
---
The addon “spy” works wonder, though!
---
100$ for 20 hours is 5$ an hour.
---
In any case just stay strong and bring the shaman to 60, it will be that much quicker to bring another toon up once you have a max level earner.
---
Fair fights are rare but things like entangling roots help you get out of a sticky situation alive if not victorious. 
---
Hell, I know polymorph is a must for mages when leveling anyway, but 70% of the reason I grabbed it is for clutch sheeps on red level players. Get ganked? Nova, blink, sheep, /pat, run hahaha
---
CMs has their own little community of competitors going for fast times. I enjoyed them more than M  since gear was more locked.
---
Because it violates the terms of service agreement.
---
So if I am a tauren, what do I need to have Honored Reputation in to get a discount on the mount? Thunder Bluff? I am a bit confused by it
---
I have it in-game. Floating text option.
---
charge is your blink. GO!
---
There is a lot of pvp on my realm. I encounter way to many alliance who want a fight.
---
Why only one of you has red eyes...
---
Be a druid
---
Pffft. Key map that bad boy to your mouse.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Why spread Twink awareness till later ... took 1 post to have all the Twink gear selling at a ridiculous amount of gold.
---
As much as I envy the names Benediction and Anethema playing ally on pvp server is playing the underdog, this is part of that experience fortunately things dont seem to be so scewed as the nightmare scenario you suggest. But please enjoy competeing with an overpopulated alliance for honor kills come phase 2.
---
Ah I see, speaking of which, is there a way to make npc have diff color names than players? I always have trouble finding npc standing in a bunch of players
---
really all depends on how many are on your server. anywhere from 50s to 2g probably
---
Yeah that's how MMOs work. You'll also begin to notice the fact that they aren't going to stop. And we all know what it means when a business stays in business. 
---
Tbh you should edit out the link to the screenshot of their website. You're basically advertising it.
---
Odd bug, only bug I've seen Is people playing and running around but they are looking in the same direction the whole time so it is like they are running full pelt but sideways or backwards
---
I am still gonna level and heal as shadow but I'm pretty sure I'll respec at 60 to holy or disc
---
No bgs, people still leveling and we are still in phase 1.
---
What where you racing to 60 for?
---
B.F.A gives free level cap for getting to 60, so I guess you can run retail whilst you wait.
---
Go to RP PvE server plz
---
That's the whole alliance though. Tall human who took a bath in food coloring, regular human, short human, or shorter human.
---
What? I just said gear-score is better than item level. You do understand gearscore is derived directly from stats translated into DPS for that class/spec, unlike ilvl.
---
&gt; and it really has no place.
---
Why not? If I have two people asking to join - same spec, same talents, all the same but different gear, how do you determine who you invite?
---
It's fine if you don't *want* people to use any other kind of definition of the word, if you think it's insensitive.
---
But he absolutely used it correctly. Whether that definition is insensitive or not today is perhaps a good question, but acting like the only correct definition is the mental illness doesn't do anyone any favors.
---
Ok yeah that mage is absolute trash but you know what elevates him above alliance? He actually fought you 1v1.
---
I am yet to have an alliance player engage me 1v1 and I’ve done most of my levelling in PvP hotbeds. It’s either gang rape or gestures to try to avoid a fight if they’re alone.
---
Absolute faction of pussies.
---
Why do people all greed on BOE epics? its just prime for ninja looters to steal. if everyone is going to greed, everyone should just need
---
There is only so much gameplay discussion to be had.
---
I can confirm is rage inducing
---
Exactly. Why all these convoluted new rules? Need if you want to equip it, greed if you want to sell it. Nice and simple.
---
On what savage server do you play where everyone greeds on Boe epics?!
---
Yes you can get up to exalted reputation which I believe makes it even cheaper. Yes reputation with the tautens I.e thunder bluff. Alternatively you can buy riding in orgrimmar if you have good reputation with orgrimmar (orcs) and a discount will equally apply
---
Never ever seen this mentality except the last year or two on private servers.. Needing on BoE's used to be a huge dick move unless you were going to equip it. People could be civil.
---
It was bad from the start. Should have opened win R1 frostbolt to get that slow up ASAP.
---
&gt; Pandaren is a result of straw drawing and Chin raw money grab. It's all.
---
[Is it really now?](https://wow.gamepedia.com/History_of_pandaren_in_Warcraft) If anything, Blizzard held off of adding the Pandaren until the fourth expansion because of 'legal issues' in China.
---
Fun fact: Pandaren were originally going to be the playable Alliance race for Burning Crusade, but were scrapped halfway through development in favour of the Draenei. A French magazine that visited Blizzard's headquarters in 2005 and reported on this were called out for bullshitting when the Draenei were announced; when what they saw was probably real.
---
It's only the first month. Experiment with different classes
---
I mean yea thats the downside to rushing the content. Not sure what people expected knowing two super easy raids are the only max level content for now.
---
Holy fuck dude, it's a game. Get off your high horse. It takes forever to get anywhere. I grief, I get griefed, the story continues. I wouldn't have some of my best memories from Vanilla without someone grieving me and then me calling in the guildie reinforcements. Suddenly it's been an hour and a half of the most fun I've had, ignoring quests and running around, bc of a griefer. All these little things add up to the full experience, and taking any out is a slippery slope. Who knows what they'll see as a bug next.
---
Maybe small eggs.
---
Great timing.
---
I totally see it too, now. Kind of cool that way.
---
Which professions are the “secondary ones”? Can i pick all of them up?
---
Also does agility increase wand damage or just bows/guns/throwable?
---
I always found the reduced casting time to not be a ton of help. There's no other talents to get so of course you're going to get it, but you should always be casting it anyways then canceling if you don't need it.If you're precasting it and your tank takes damage, you let the heal go through. The reduced cast time doesn't do anything in that situation.
---
Yo, no joke, I had quite the struggle getting "The Attack!" in Stormwind done. Multiple times I'd show up and see a group or two camping the quest giver. Worth it for that sweet ring at the end though!
---
That was a tbc enchant wasn't it, clefthoof armour kits?
---
You know I told myself if I ever got one I wouldn't do an edit for it, but now the meme calls to me
---
Great question actually.
---
Thanks for the reply, feels like this guy was full of shit xD
---
Actually needing to read the quest and deduce where you need to go is part of the fun. With all these 'helpful' addons i'm suprised there isn't one that auto runs you to the quest objective, then another one that auto-fights the mobs.
---
I'm level 20, been playing since launch, what's the rush right? Why rush? It blows me away the amount of people whom feel they need to rush, rush, rush, then to actually complain when they get there ffs is actually sad and funny at the same time. No offense OP, talking about players as a whole as in this is what modern mmo's have done to players.
---
Surprised everyone didn't select need..easy to ninja it like this
---
Where do you find these stats?
---
When I read drain tank guide I expected maybe a few paragraphs, not a pdf with full analysis. Nice.
---
How about rogue? You get to pick most of your fights and red guys walking by might not see you =\]
---
War Stomp is also great for tanks since the mobs are always in range for it.
---
You're trolling dude lol. A good Ret Paladins is one of the harder classes to beat as a mage (especially as frost).
---
My longest fights are with priests, paladins and sometimes warlocks.
---
Skull shouldn't have lost but the point still stands.
---
As a horde player its been great. We have a horde of Brazilian bro's on my server ganking anything that doesn't look ugly and moves. Got through SFV quests without a single death, but did get ganked a few times and saved by others.
---
I dont think rogue can tank ,heal or even buff.Pretty useless

Yes always the one of your race.

The problem with that thing to me was the achievement system. It’s so hand holdy and arbitrary to have some obnoxious pop up and point system dictate to me what is an achievement.
---
Take your time and try different classes out that seem to interest you. I would say get them to 20 or 30 before you make your decision so you can get most of the fun skills and talents learned.
---
Hey, Jo, Ke is on you, dude.

Ok, sorry for being classist here, but that remind me that every entitled assholes i've met in the game until now have been rogues, is there a pattern ?

It's not really ahead of its time, it's just better than the current time

Cooking/Fishing/Firstaid are all Secondary, and you can pick them all up

Do whatever you enjoy most man. I completely put my Ironman on hold for classic, even though I’d never played wow before classic release. Feeling inclined to grind stuff makes it more of a chore than something you enjoy eventually.
---
You got a Hyacinth Macaw? And never played before? Damn! It's one of the rarest pets in Classic! It's actually so rare, that it's quality was changed to Rare on retail.

Congrats! Hope you're having fun!

The one I ran with yesterday always gave 3 stacks, and he always had them ready to trade, it was bliss.

yeah i agree 100% with everything you just said. politics should be private imo, don't talk about it unless you are asked. i understand why people talk about it in videogames but it's just annoying when i wanna play wow and talk about wow and my whole chat log is full of political spam lol.

Sorry but if your getting bored by 27 it might happen again, and again. Just try sticking with him or plan on the next re roll being the last because if you don't stick to something you will never keep up

True, ffx glow 0 takes care of the hideous glow in Durotar/Barrens/Westfall, makes a ton of difference.
---
Idk why I'm being downvoted, do people seriously think ally has the better questing experience? Or is being outnumbered and ganked every other quest not convincing enough for some of you?
---
Or he hasn’t even trained maces yet. I know I haven’t; I’m going with daggers, but I at least trained 1h sword for that dry spell in the 30s.
---
I am currently a lvl 17 Undead Mage, and been doing RFC and WC but I feel like my DPS is very underwhelming. I usually do the least in the group.. Do you know any special reason to that? I am speccing frost.
---
Big fucking plays!!
---
I feel that as a leveling warlock gaining 4 int while losing 7 stam and 2 spirit, on a pvp server esp, isnt a net positive.
---
"all greed"
---
Idiots, lol, that's where you all NEED!!!
---
EVERYONE NEEDS THE GOLD THIS WOULD SELL FOR!!
---
Pretty stupid thing to do sry. If you already get ganked often, it's not really a good idea to make even more enemies. If someone did this to me, they instantly get added to the Kill-on-Sight list and next time I see them on a boat, I'm prepared to kill them. People who use no-balls griefing tactics, are at the top of my KoS list and have priority over other targets.
---
Just had a druid heal ZF. Flawless run expect for that stupid goblin refusing to open the door. Subjectively a bit less raw healing power than a priest, but needs to drink less often too.
---
This is true but it does create an opportunity for good mages. So many people now massively underestimate mages in wPvP. I have been absolutely ruining rogues recently who open with cheap shot on a mage 😂
---
Exalted does not give a further discount for mount. Exalted is required with a faction other than your races to get their mount
---
Or sneeze. Or shift left. Or take any action. Or heck just stand still and void taunt gets a resist.
---
Ehm those charges dont replenish..?You would need to have shitloads of them and endless grinding ?
---
Economize your time/running areas, you often get lots of quests to go into a town or kill certain NPCs, you will usually be able to get lots of quests done in a single area at one time. You will often fail and need to go back for just one quest you missed, and that's ok. Vendor your items at every opportunity. Poke your head into each room when you get into a new town, and talk to all vendors. Lots of vendors have special or limited items to sell. Have fun.
---
It does if you're in the Barrens and trying to MC a horde player
---
Why? In this case where noone really needs, eveyone should need unless you are 100% sure noone will need if the rest of the party greeds. That way noone can ninjaloot it.

Uuuu uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Need if you need the gold.

Which everyone does.

so everyone should need.

Everyone's servers go by differnet rules it seems

 Is there a good guide (or even just a list) of endgame quests that you want to do because they have good rewards and/or are "required" for raiding.
---
Stuff like these guys quests: [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13278/duke-hydraxis](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13278/duke-hydraxis) 
---
I figure why not start working on these now when I am in the high 50s so that I still get EXP for them since I will end up doing them anyways.
---
has a nice creepy vibe
---
Secondary professions are first aid, cooking, and fishing. You can have all 3 as well as any two of the primary professions
---
What's the point of playing on a PvE realm though. There will be no content once you cleared raids and got your gear. All the end-game action will be on PvP realms.
---
This is such an innocent joke, you're not being mean to the guy at all, you're writing a jokey line. And I totally agree with you, those mages were just doing it for money, and just as you say they act like they're doing something nice for people.
---
I don't think what they are doing is like, *agressively bad*, but I don't understand how you were made out as the bad guy in this thread lol

For wpvp I'd definitely say shaman. Ghost wolf and totems will help you kite and run away like crazy. I think ele becomes a one shot monster in the later phases but enhance looks fun if you're lucky. Warrior solo is super weak from what I've heard so unless you have a pocket healer I'd stay away. Plus shaman have crazy utility with their totems for your guild groups.

Devilsaur leather is $$$ right now. You can essentially create your own farming spots instead of running around on a circuit looking for herbs. It's a steady, mindless source of income. If you have two monitors and just want to Netflix and farm, skinning is your best choice. 
---
However, herbs are good money right now and will only increase as more guilds start pushing in BWL and further. Also, some lower level herbs like stranglekelp, swiftthistle, and briarthorn are always valuable, especially when the PVP system kicks off.
---
It Will eventually drop
---
If you already a better one than the problem of having your starter bow at level 20 has been solved.
---
If you couldn't find a WC group, that means you were one of the first to reach 1k needles, arguably doing well enough for yourself that you don't need these tips in the first place. What was your motivation again?
---
You tend to end up doing a lot of 1v1 in world pvp. Warriors are by far the worst 1v1 class. They only really shine in pvp when they have great gear and someone constantly healing/dispelling them. Between your two choices I would absolutely go shaman.
---
I use classicdb.ch since it is a copy of thottbot

There's always dayblade

He is not a great tank. His taunt does little to nothing even with improved talents. 2 dots and wand attack and he can’t even keep aggro.

Skeram horde also 59 lock and I've gotten  a handful of whispers for dungeons but drastically less than I assume mages get lol
---
What addon is showing your xp bar like that?
---
Stay on the most pop server for best long run classic XP. A lot of servers players at 60 will become barren as people roll alts on more desired servers. I’ve been watching chat late hrs and read a lot about players from low -high pop coming too my full pop while que is low because their realm feels more empty. Honestly, roll full pop, get remote pc viewer app to get in ques.
---
I think its because *most* people wouldn't actually use an epic boe even if it was a substantial upgrade. The gold from selling it is far more valuable, and you can probably find a comparable item that is only a little worse in a dungeon or from a quest.
---
Maybe

When you know that your raid is going to wipe within the next minute or so, you deliberately take some damage while equipping the skull, hide out of LoS of the healers, and squawk yourself to death for no repair bills.

&gt; **TL:DR Leshraque was world 2nd 60 and complained incessantly about how unethical this is, and also complained about how jokerd's 60 wasn't legitimate.. Now it has come to light that he is in a group of both Horde and Alliance guilds who are working together to exploit demand for important items within the game. Using discord to communicate cross faction (there is a reason you can only make Horde OR Alliance toons in classic) to prevent anyone other than themselves from having access to the materials.** 
---
Except at no point did he complain about Joker getting world first, and was quite vocal during his recent interview with Countdown to Classic about how stupid it was that he could exploit layering to farm devilsaur leather.
---
Also, it hasn't 'come to light'. OP has shared a video in which he himself is seen to be working with a Horde playing friend and shared a grainy screenshot that doesn't mention or include Leshraque. It's not proof - it's a guy being bitter because he got called out on his ninja skinning BS.
---
You mean shortly after Nost got shut down and there was a huge cry for vanilla servers this sub was made? Wow, that's crazy.
---
We will most likely try this as soon as the husband finishes what he needs for his warrior quest in STV (he's gotta get that whirlwind axe, of course).  Completely forgot about SM quests in Desolace.  Thanks!

Never happened, but don't let that stop you from getting on the hate train.

Yesterday i asked a mage to give me 160 water for 50 silvers. I gave him wisdom pala buff, sat next to him and yea he did it. Slowly.He said thank you, and i could go for instances the next 5 hours without getting water again. Gud life.
---
Damn. That's a good point. I feel for you. They should make time rolls right to the death for the item.

Deleted comment to not spread bullshit ty
---
In the same interview, he was very clear in saying it was stupid that he was able to do that. He was literally calling the layering bullshit.

You can go perfectly fine. Sure you will find a group faster as a tank or heal but all is viable

You’re wack for sitting in a different room. Lol why even have them over?

Disgusting.

so much this. I prefer auests and roleplay, but sometimes u rrally just want and go grind couple of hours,solo.
---
See that's just barbaric. Everyone needs gold, so everyone would always need everything, making the whole system pointless.
---
Here’s my honest opinion: I would take you for an easier dungeon. Your blessings are good but I would prefer someone with more crowd control and damage.. another class that is specifically a damage only class. 
---
But, what you could do is create your own groups. Learn to lead through dungeons and pick other classes that you mesh well with. You won’t have any problems then..

Should I sink it into the VW or just rush imp drain life and fel concentration etc? I don't like waiting on my vw and losing aggro after wanding and not sure if the talent is going to really change that. I lean on the side of draintanking but someone who's smarter than me can maybe advise?

Gold is only valuable because it allows you to get more gear or get gear more easily.. In the end it all comes down to gear, or maybe cosmetics if that's something you care about. Your mount allows for faster farming and questing. Pots, patterns, mats, all just stepping stones for obtaining better gear. If you find an upgrade and you sell it because you think the gold is more valuable you're stupid.

This.  Place your faith in the succ.

I wouldn’t mind meeting stones being like a “bulletin board” to be used as lfg. You still have to run to the dungeon and interact with people.

I played a paladin in vanilla through BC. If you’re craving damage, save yourself a ton of frustration and roll a caster or rogue that has no healing spells, because otherwise, if you’ve got heals, that’s what people will expect. 
---
I know it’s not a good story, but at 185 days played on a paladin I can say blizzard didn’t know what the hell they were doing until **at least** Lich King in regards to this class.
---
and if you had the intelligence of a gnome youd understand why without me having to explain!
---
Now do it without healing!
---
You do know it will take at least 6 months for battlegrounds, right?
---
You also realize that the majority of the server population will not be at 10-19 and instead be pvping in the 40+ brackets?
---
Stock up by all means, just make sure you are willing to keep playing for a lot time if bgs get delayed.
---
insane that people are ok with this, even if this post is a lie and u still can mc people off boats, the fact that people arent up in arms about it just proves to me how easily a game can be ruined by mindless drones. 
---
thx for that reminder

Ya once you're at 60 if u wanna raid you'll need to respec, disc is still good for pvp healing to
---
What is an alot?

Gold can me transformed into other things though. Train your professions, buy more skills, work towards your epic mount. Locking that gold into a BoE that's going to be replaced eventually is very short sighted.
---
Farming that ole karma
---
Being able to play at work is a blessing.

I mean... People would have to log off their own server, switch to that one, and then wait in queue, just so that someone else could get in.

You can do that by disabling strafing.

Level up. Different classes hit peaks at different levels.

sure look nice but i feel like the real thing would look like shit.

Yea i was wondering about that. How it works exactly? If im low level horde i have to attack first to get tagged in barrens? How does crossroads raid work then if half the population is untargetable?
---
That was beautifull PepeHands

Or being hexed or being made to sleeep
---
What do you mean by 1.12 BRD? There's a bunch of items that "should" drop in BRD that doesn't drop yet, and won't before like phase 5. Is this separate from that?
---
Because nobody should be equipping BoE epics while leveling unless they're loaded and buy it off the AH. It's actually more useful to sell the BoE epic than it is to equip it while leveling.
---
So everyone just needs so it's a fair roll no matter what and cant be ninja'd. All need is a much safer choice.
---
It comes down to whether or not you think it's fair to take BoE epics to equip them over other being able to sell them. 
---
For me there's no chance at all you're getting me to agree with a warrior taking something like Edgemaster's Handguards. Being nice to strangers is one thing. Giving up a shot to instantly make 1k gold for your epic mount so that they can have an item that'll only be useful if they level to 60 and actually raid is way too much.
---
This also applies to any twink items. It's idiotic to expect 4 other players to be cool with you taking Shadowfang so you can use it for a few levels before replacing it when it's worth so much gold.

So many Illusionary Staves.

The other reply about them stacking is 100% not true.  Whatever your weapon is enchanted with will be the only affect you get.  If you have no weapon enchantment then you will gain the affect of your totem.  You cannot have two different affects on your weapon.  Also, while on this topic, it can be seen with rogue weapons; they self apply poisons which count as a weapon enchantment on their main hand and thus cannot gain windfury or weapon enchantment from your totems.
---
Hope this helps clarify things.

The questlines in Brill are pretty damn good.  (If you ever dabble in retail, they're fucking amazing from the Undead starter zone through Hillsbrad).

If you're never done RFC or WC, those are obviously a must.

---
Good thing is you have no way to catch me and I can Rejuv the dots no problem, but trying to kill you fuckers? No way in hell.
---
For AoE tanking, consecration is necessary IMHO
---
He's alrdy said he cannot handle not seeing the nameplate. He can still keep distance and all that but he's mentally unable to that's what this whole post is about
---
Including their melee strike. It put them on a 3 year course of ho-hum auto-attack-wait-for-SoC-proc gameplay.  Lame.
---
I'm lvl 41 and not hating it yet. Guess I can get back to you if I start hating the other 19 levels.
---
yeah gl catching a mage that isn't retarded lol. if you even walked my way i would toy with you for a while before dumpstering you while you rage away behind your keyboard.
---
People agreed to roll need, that way noone can ninja loot it.
---
speedruns to 60 in one week...  
---
"I've nothing to do QQ"
---
I did this yesterday with a group of horde in searing gorge. Warrior thought it would be fun to keep kiting mobs into me and hitting whirlwind and then bow down my pet.
---
Im not a bitch so i just jumped him in the middle of his friends and we both died.
---
I then proceeded to fear / dot spam them as they tried to kill that elite overseer. 
---
The second time another alliance group rolled in and i just PMed them and told them the situation &amp; to steal that fucking mob.
---
nah i've never been tipped.
---
But it's nice being high up here!
---
Don't take it too seriously. I'm just at the other end of the spectrum. You grief others and I grief griefers.
---
I still find griefing to be repulsive and unmanly, but without it, I wouldn't be as good as I am in PvP. Killing a griefer gives me a nice dose of Dopamin and makes my justice boner grow with every kill. So I kinda need you to be assholes, so I can shine.
---
The shit-talking of you griefers is just an added bonus.
---
Alright, thanks for the response. What happens after 30-40, when warriors catch up, do you become more of a dps in dungeons?
---
Cher!?
---
Blyg uploaded xD
---
so you telling me there's a chance?
---
You cannot kill riders any more, but wayyyyy back when, it was a thing.  It was very popular to sit as a warlock or spriest and dot the passers by.
---
Yes. You're missing out on FUN. yeah, tight on time is a problem. But the experience can be really nice otherwise. Some pretty cool chains around some of them as well.
---
It's going to be entirely dependent upon what level you are and server culture. 
---
Fairbanks Alliance is very chill at 60 and you'd have no problem getting a group unless the group was already stacked with off-meta specs. It might be harder at lower tiers where higher populations allow group leaders to be a little more picky.
---
As long as you're bringing a tank, healer, and one quality pure DPS it doesn't really matter what your other two dps are so long as they know how to buff and are basically competent. Make you own groups.
---
They are all hunter loots...
---
Any crowd control you prefer
---
Is this actually a rule?
---
Some people have five friends or guildies and don’t need to roll need in fear.
---
Don’t know if you did it but there’s a quest for red ridge that starts in the forest
---
&gt;Do like other warriors I guess and focus on green quests as they still give the same XP reward. 
---
Green quests give progressively LESS xp for each level they are green.
---
Running ZF be like that. Shadowhunters just chain hex you
---
102.4%, defense counteracting the 0.6% parry dodge block miss (the fact that druids can't do one of those makes it even worse) added by skull mobs always exceeding you by 3 levels.
---
I have healed as a shadow priest all dungoens up to zf without problems. Most of the time dps warrior as tank.
---
I used to MT MC, ZG, Ony, parts of BWL and OT AQ40 back in vanilla. After 1.08 everything was fine. Druids got a deserved bad rep before the talent updates but the reputation persists for no reason to this day.
---
Opportunity cost at this point. if you plan on playing for more than 3 weeks from this point on and really do hate wpvp, you'll be doing yourself a favor rolling on a pve server.
---
I see that writing comments to discredit peoples arguments with "this guy/gal is a virgin" did not work out as you expected, so you are now doing standard fanboy white knighting? Nice. How does trying to pretend to be in the right despite knowing that your are totally in the wrong feels?
---
Just upset you’re playing a worse rogue?
---
No. And as people have mentioned that sounds potentially mute-able.
---
Just type out your whisper for the first guy, CTRL + A, - &gt; CTRL + C.
---
Then just paste it with CTRL + V with every person you right click and whisper. It's definitely fast enough for me to whisper 5 people in a row in less than 3 seconds.
---
Not in classic.

"They beat the game 15 years ago, you silly goose."
---
Skinning is easier to level, herbalism can sometimes take you out of the way to level.  Skinning during peak grind makes a lot of gold and also end-game with Devilsaur as well.   However, if you play a class that will have difficulty end-game soloing Devilsaurs OR you find the competition on your server is a bit much, Herbalism all day long.
---
Herbing is also nice because you can farm your own raid potions/elixirs without having to buy them.
---
I feel your pain buddy! Rolled vs another guy on Kang the Decapitator. Both rolled 97 and guess who lost.
---
Only time I run void is if I know a rogue or warrior is around.
---
You want the fastest sword possible to apply instant poison more often.
---
yep, kurith already explained. he named his character "smuggler" and his guild name was "heirloom vendor". he actually was walking around in stormwind like a npc before stopping at the shop :D i watched him do all that. i think a lot of ppl god baited. i too was like WTF when i saw him in the first moment lol
---
I concur. I’ve had two posts with 500 upvotes deleted for low effort. You mods wouldn’t know a good meme if it pooped upon your brow. Good day.
---
Prana spending all his gold on Rumsey Rum at the Blue Recluse rather than saving for a mount.
---
This exact same thing happened to me aswell, except we both rolled 93.
---
What about the streamers who are fire fighters also?
---
I miss Mograine already, I just had to take a break for a week and thought why not get on a new server where people are not all 50 to 60 yet.. Big mistake, Judgement is a dead realm
---
He's coming right for us!
---
Most mining nodes can be found around the base of a hill or at a "crest" like little humps or the peak.  It's uncommon to see it on a straight slant.
---
The argument I'm trying to make here is stating "Everyone need" when a BoE epic drops is a good system to prevent ninjaing and to give everyone a truly fair roll on it.
---
If you don't Need BoE Epics in pugs you are a sucker. Keep doing that.
---
I understand what you're saying but whispering people is precisely why I'm able to make my own groups for every dungeon within minutes. While everyone else, even healers are complaining about spamming /LFG /World /2 for hours for a tank. I promise you if you're looking for members and you don't get a bite after however long, and begin whispering people instead, you'll find that your groups come to together much more quickly.
---
Play paladin.
---
Whatever you want.  You can tank or dps as feral pretty easily.
---
If you keep an int set you can heal as well.  ( pretty much as any spec)
---
He openly said these things on the Countdown to Classic podcast. He also openly and directly mentioned that he got 300 Devilsaur leather from abusing layering. It was the episode from last week regarding layering and the race to world 1st.
---
You're going to have to elaborate, which part is sad and what do you mean by "help". It was a warzone, I killed more than just this lock, he just never managed to escape the mess of players pvping for 3 hours straight lmfao, it was nesingwarys camp in stv, and it was a lot of fun. I could've let him escape, but like I said, he took an easy kill, this was the price he paid. 
---
Like fuck, when did reddit become a bunch of sissies regarding this game? I'm sure everyone who downvoted me is the type to cry and complain if they've been killed more than once, "you're griefing me!!!!". If you cant win, or escape, switch to one of those rp servers, because clearly you suck, at this aspect of the game and will be much more successful in a safer place.
---
They deleted my Sea Crits post and I've seen multiple jokes of the same type since.
---
Sometimes I wonder why this sub is even here... is it just to repeat all the same jokes and points that we talked about 10 years ago?
---
You’re an idiot if you equip shadow fang and are not a twink. Rule of thumb never roll need on a BOE w/o asking unless agreed on before.
---
I was confused as to how the Hunter did so poorly when he had the first shots.  Looks like he was low on mana and ran out quickly.
---
Theres so many more people playing this game than there were on private servers. Yes, we will run into people who use the tools you mentioned but it will be a minority compared to the actual population currently playing this game.
---
So at lvl 60 going in bg with bis items against players without would be cheating as well?
---
Sounds like he's very clearly a hypocrite then. If you say something is bullshit then still abuse it, still a dick move.
---
You definitely aint finding all the quests. 
---
Some of them out there are obscure as fuck, like a random bit of trash 80% buried on a beach in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere. No !
---
40-60 always seemed faster then 0-40... maybe just me.
---
I like how you keep posting the same comment. Spread the knowledge.
---
Really? I remember eating clothies with it in battlegrounds... or maybe that was in BC?
---
I was lucky enough to get Frostreaver Crown and Sword of Corruption as world drops. Does anyone have an idea of roughly how long these items might sell for, or the best time to sell them might be? Thanks!!
---
There are free server transfers but it's from specific servers to specific servers. There's no paid transfers.
---
SNAP IITTTT
---
*Thomas had never seen such bullshit before
---
I’m at level39 (mage) with only 55g
---
Which place (or which activity) you can recommend to farm gold for my mount?
---
You know that's a dude though, right?
---
Just do what everyone else does and pve to pvp. Ferals are still viable in raids btw, they just require a lot of farming to make work
---
 Ihate it when people randomly whisper me for stuff like that. If I'm looking for a group, I look in the lfg and general chat channels. It's super rude to assume that I am just because it's taking you longer than you would like to form a group. 
---
Plus, as said before, pretty sure Blizzard won't like something like that very much as it screams 'spam.'
---
It just gets posted to a random hunter after the 3rd hidden roll.
---
It doesn't. You can only kill people in non-contested territories if they have a PVP flag on.
---
Grid+Clique was my goto setup for raid healing.
---
Start charging people not in your dungeon party 30s a stack. If they complain, just tell them “Time is money, friend” and walk away
---
wow you sound so cool
---
That is true, thank you! I just got a bit worried because our warrior and warlock where easily out DPSing me.
---
My guild wants me to OT druid for them. I am the highest level druid at 53. I want to heal, but so far there is really only two druids in the guild that are 50+. What do I do?
---
Wouldn’t of lost if you needed on it
---
If that's the only qualifier, I am also undead.
---
Livin' the dream...
---
Play highest pop server you can. Few months down the road you may thank yourself.
---
I had a guy block me because I left the not ready to go group I was in to join a group that was fully ready once I joined. The dude whispered me saying he doesn’t play with party hoppers and ignored me
---
I don’t rage lol I’m busy having fun. I kill many mages, though. Always seem to be an easy target. Killed a mage and a pally 2v1, too.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d44a30/someone_won_me_on_a_tie_roll/). 
---
And you were -this- close to getting that mount.
---
It’s possible but you will need to likely offtank some fights as well.
---
At least it will be much easier to get a spot in a guild if you are willing to tank some.
---
We're you not around back in vanilla? All druid raids cleared Ony, ZG, MC, AQ20 and went into BWL and AQ40
---
Young one, life is too short to harbor saltiness.
---
you gotta remember that even if theres a change that a nochanges player may want, theyll still go against it because theyre afraid what other changes itll lead to and you really cant blame them for it.
---
What if it's an upgrade for someone who's going to equip it, then?
---
Self promote else where
---
i'm playing combat swords and know damn well that a big enough non-sword upgrade is worth using... but damned if i'm going to sacrifice the delicious, swashbuckling sword rogue flavor for a bit of extra dps. at least not until 60.
---
As far as I can tell, yes.  I tried add game, scan, folder permissions, etc.
---
That's crazy. I'll hold on the to guy and see what happens never know what's gonna happen
---
dw, it's just like grammar nazi phase back then.

Grimnak best bro 4 life

And i bought 60% on 41 xD

Unless this has some item level requirements that I can't find anywhere. If there is a item level requirement and there are no other pants enchantments that require a BoE than I may have wasted gold buying 2 pairs of these.
---
The letters V and C appear quite literally nowhere in the name of the dungeon itself. Give me another dungeon in which that is the case.
---
I see you didn't get a ton of replies, so I'll help you out here.  
---
Warrior fury/arms and macroing weapon/shield to tank in a pinch in both questing and dungeons.  Warrior should try to build two gear sets, one for tanking and one for DPS.  Early game they will likely only have one gear set.
---
Priest should go Shadow, the reason for this is, you can still heal well enough as a shadow priest in the 1-40s range that you can be a dungeon healer and still have great DPS for questing.  If you go holy/disc, sign your boredom warrant, you'll be spamming for groups all day long or become dependent on the warrior to be online and doing the DPS in questing duo.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Meanwhile I can't help but notice your minimap buttons.
---
Dear god
---
The best story. It brought tears to my eyes. I was so involved in it, hoping for a happy ending. 
---
And then.... It ended with tragedy.
---
You act as though every tiny upgrade didnt feel awesome at that level, grey shoulders, a green with 1 spirit on it. Honestly the set could've been the lamest thing in the world, which is kind of is, and still be awesome. If you compare it to end game sets, or sets from later iterations of wow, then yeah obviously its poopoo but for the first set in the game its rad
---
Immolate first not last.
---
Send VW to target &gt; Immolate as he walks over &gt; Create as much space between the target and yourself while applying instant cast curse of agony and corruption. 
---
You can probably get in 1 wand and 1 shadow bolt before you aggro too
---
Can you ask that SM Armoury guy if he's still looking for one DPS? I'm a warlock looking to run it.
---
/s
---
I know there are cast sequence macros that will go one after the other,  never tried to have the tooltip change with each press or if it would be doable, possibly just need to add show tooltip after each one in macro, that being said never heard of a use sequence macro before.
---
No, it changed based on the spellpower gear you have.
---
Did you kill Cookie though?
---
Ravager will proc off windfury though

If you need gold you could grind raptors, tigers or basilisks in stv for a whole level or two, or elementals in badlands.
---
It's boring, but its pretty good money and gets you xp at the same time. Even better if you have skinning

always need on purple

You feel better now?

---
I bet you're the skull rogue that ganked me on the edge of feralas and 1k needles... scumbag.
---
I had a druid 15 levels above me, try to gank while I was eating. He ended up dying since he over committed. I sac'd the voidy twice on 15% hp, so he tried to stay and go through it in cat form. 
---
Only tried to heal once on 15% himself, when I just feared him and crit with a shadowbolt -&gt; searing pain combo.
---
This! :D
---
Maybe if you don't play a dot class, but Warlocks can't tell which mobs have their dots on them without giving up half of their effective range.
---
How are winners decided on a tie?
---
how do you know? was there a post? damn, love blizz for being strict.
---
and 10min before that, and 10min before that. It's ridiculous how many people are trying to repost the same screenshot.
---
What a coincidence! Imagine dividing something into four equal pieces, and they all turn out to be quarters — what are the odds?
---
Nice way to ding 60!
---
Explain
---
Nah he means you got the template wrong
---
The meme is meant to look at the sheep twice
---
Only because of scumbags like you, used to be able to trust most people to greed. Now everyone needs for gold and rationalizes why theyre right.
---
Are you autistic? Or do you just like reposting the same thing over and over. He gets it. You havent had trouble on your server.
---
A whole +5 damage on corruption and agonys full duration.
---
Situations like this are why I love playing ret. Righteous Fury, HoJ the mob on the healer, tag up the others to generate threat, regroup and drop RF to let the tank gain threat again.
---
But Ret is trash. Never forget. Absolutely worthless spec.
---
I went from playing a druid that needs to drink to a warlock that needs to eat. I dunno where I'm going next but i don't like it
---
Campaigns against somebody based on a baseless accusation from a bitter player.
---
Calls somebody else a white knight.
---
Alright, sunshine.
---
Do you only ever put dots on one mob in a dungeon?
---
it's also mana from lifetaps
---
So true. Just yesterday I was questing in 1K Flats and there was mutual peacetime going on with people questing. Well enter this 35 Lock who on her way by (to Gadget direction), just dots all 4 Horde players in the area. I was the first casualty.
---
When I came back to my body there was a low health priest left drinking water and a bunch of fresh corpses. The best part is the Human lock that started it all was on auto run the whole time, I don't think she even stopped.
---
We didn't battle again afterwards, I think we all agreed the run is just not worth it. But we kept an awkward distance after the incident, good times.
---
This is one of the dumbest comments I've ever read... but I'll reply.
---
&gt; You do know it will take at least 6 months for battlegrounds, right?
---
Yes... I do know that it will be some time before BG's are released. This is exactly why I am buying all of the gear now while it is cheap. It's called an investment.
---
&gt; You also realize that the majority of the server population will not be at 10-19 and instead be pvping in the 40+ brackets?
---
This is the dumbest part of your comment. OF COURSE the majority of the population won't be level 10-19... /sigh . The majority also won't be in the 40+ brackets... by then they'll be in the lvl 60 BG. You level up a new character specific to the bracket you want to play in (19, 29, etc.).
---
You were so preoccupied with whether you could you didn’t stop to think whether you should... - Dr Ian Malcolm
---
Why would you put that god-awful music over your video...
---
why? why ability to loose all defensive skills and gain ONLY 15% more dmg is good? looks shit as for me :( 15% dmg is nothing. Not a real target for ultimate fnal talant
---
Gave me a good laugh. Thanks for that
---
Hey. This is bad and all, but use blizzard report system. This goes against reddit rules on witch hunting.
---
Your post might get removed.
---
Is there a way to show more detailed character stats in classic? The current character window gives only a very high level overview i.e. doesn't even show crit or hit chance.
---
I'm talking about the advanced options like this: https://media.forgecdn.net/avatars/58/727/636141446065063435.png
---
Is it worth creating two characters on different realms, e.g. PvP and PvE realms, or does it make more sense to keep characters on the same realm?
---
Or you can state loot rules before hand and get a GM to intervene if someone ninjas.
---
How? Please
---
now the post is just below this one.
---
&gt; I am doubting its existence
---
&gt; I was not accusing you
---
Okay then lol.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LL1uaU8MnfXPHWE1cqEiqnZcFS-uTvoIEyoXI52S3tk/edit#gid=23735557) is Vidda's sheet and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMvSgtbNdDtOkDwPuRy9WmO6q1ZZeFnvrOK4C30lvV0/edit#gid=511744849) is an alternative. Both found by simply typing "spreadsheet" into the search bar of their Discord. Note that you'll have to make some slight edits to Vidda's to get the correct dps; it uses Frostbolt Rank 11 by default. It also misses some preraid items. I have no significant experience with Ginner's mage sheet, but it seems to cover all the bases and, according to the Mage Discord, produces similar results.
---
Yeh I asked Booty Bay mages for buff.
---
At level 46 I then came to the Nagas near the exit and upped my Polearm from Zero with the help on 2 then 4 horde players. Was fun.
---
Healer has plenty of mana so not really tanks fault. But yeah, that's what I want to do on my paladin on my way to 60. Just don't know at what lvl to start.
---
Equipping it is irrelevant. The winner has got potentially several hundred gold in value, whether the gold is in the form of an equipped item or actual gold is irrelevant
---
What are your professions? If you have skinning, AoE farm beasts with improved blizzard and skin them
---
There’s a special place in my heart for horde rogues waiting till I’m killing a mob to stealth kill me. So I have a kill on sight rule where no matter the level if you’re horde rogue I’m killing you. Even if I’m in a rush and 30 levels above you.
---
you like dead realms huh
---
Hey man, someone in my guild messaged me that there summoning circle was there when it should be (even though he was aware of the glitch going on) he invited me to his party and after that I was able to see the circle, it may be fixed now or you can try in a party
---
No. Form a group so everyone gets credit or come back later. It’s not hard.
---
Find an area with no players leveling, and this isn’t an issue.
---
Is it really hard to be skeptical about a situation after the OP deletes his entire post? Lmao. Go troll somewhere else kid. OP obviously was trying to get some attention.
---
Was this on Rattlecage? My roommate just started playing the game (he comes from Osrs lol), and that’s something he would say.
---
Why avoid thick hide?
---
If you get it post it here instead of pm.
---
One of the main reasons problems go unsolved is the solution doesn't get distributed.
---
Posting it here means others could find it too
---
Mainly because of kids and idiots (as above) who needs. Forces the rest of us to need aswell because of risk that someone steals it
---
Do you want to have to respect later? Drain tanking isn't really amazing until the 30s, even the late 30s. I have seen guides recommend improved imp until then. I honestly think the difference in efficiency isn't all that much, everything is pretty viable. I personally went drain tank the whole way and while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't strong that early. It's probably more of a personal preference and your playstyle that should make the decision.
---
why would you say that I want it to die if I keep saying I want it preserved? I'm pretty sure classic will end up removed slowly over the years because of viewpoints like this. it should be preserved
---
I scrolled back up just to see the minimap. What have I done?
---
Are you sure about this? I remember a mage buddy doing this, but he had to disconnect himself not log out, so he'd have a second window of wow open, as soon as he'd made the portal he would log into the second window disconnecting his mage and log in on his second character and take the portal
---
What's the best / easiest class for a complete beginner to play? My wife has taken interest after hearing me talk about classic non-stop for the last 3 weeks. I tried her out on a hunter lastnight but she got super frazzled trying to manage keeping a distance so she can shoot, then having to melee. Still another 6 levels before she gets her pet and I'm afraid she won't hold interest that long.
---
welp
---
I spent Vanilla hanging out in Undercity. Once you get used to it, it's actually really tight and efficient to use, probably the most efficient of all the OG capitals.
---
I'm in Org these days because I find I like the sunshine and want to hang out with NPCs who don't openly revel in torture and murder.
---
You're just bad and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
Because it creates artificial ques, and is literally horrible for the other faction.
---
Imagine doing that on an 80/20 server... So 3/4 of the alliance are now stuck in que, until they re-roll the other faction or people join? You just killed a high pop all the way down to a low pop, and made it awful for the huge majority of players.
---
People have been bitching about the ques all month... Think of the outrage if Blizz started implementing multi-hour long ques for a single faction.
---
with the help of some horde players, they were able to widdle the elites for us to gank them and take the credit instead.
---
tanks arnt even needes
---
&gt; None of us want the game to be changed or reset after sometime nor any upgrades to TBC or something else. We just want it to be classic and nothing more.
---
Well and others do. No one has the right to get what "they" want. Everyone wants something different. TBC servers won't be a thing for months after the last phase if Blizz considers continuing on so IMO I wouldn't worry about people already thinking about it.
---
&gt; that’s why private servers worked well without any new content for years
---
Were private servers as big as classic is right now? Did they cost money to play? I guess not. No new content and same classic forever after Naxx won't work. Blizzard wants to make money off Classic and I really doubt the bulk of people (which are necessary to keep classic sustained) wants to do nothing forever.
---
Again, if you have fun with the game right now and are just slowly leveling up...do that. Have fun. Let the people with for TBC or Wrath or whatever...it won't happen for quite some time. The usual expansion cycle is 2 years...plenty of time to see all of classic.
---
&gt;The future is now old man
---
Exactly so learn how to use a fuckin computer
---
So you would write in the chatbox "Hey thanks man......" (with the periods mind you) and wait a few seconds until the cast was completely done?
---
I dunno about you but after i'm done typing thanks i hit enter.
---
Yeah of course, but its all about supply and demand, right now tanks are in big demand, i even have people whispering me for SM while i quest in stranglethorn and i dont even know the guys.  
---
Say if there is 10 people all searching for a tank, then its all about the first guy who accepts the deal, cause i doubt they all wanna sit there while their group slowly disintegrates
---
Nah locking down an important pre-raid BiS resource is far more damaging, what a joke.
---
stop posting this trash
---
It will be a shame if your duo doesn't end up being known as KeJo.
---
Sometimes, more like all the time :)

How did you know they were 15 levels higher?

Rofl sounds like you’re the type of guy to rage when I kill you. That’s why you blink away “because it’s a waste of time”

This was WC for me the first time around... that jump. I had a sticky spacebar. Ended up remapping jump to V so I wouldn't look like a noob. Those were great times.
---
Well, you can only have one faction on pvp realms. I have my horde on pvp and alliance on a pve realm
---
You are just stupid, I understand it's hard to deal with it.
---
I ofc never Need BoP rares/epics, when there is clearly someone in the group that could use them. But if you intentionally give up a chance for a free shitton of gold on and item that isn't even pre-raid BiS and people *will* vendor it later on, you are a moron.
---
Had this with questie, had elizas grave dirt as available even though I hadn't even reached the required quest.
---
Sorry, my native language isn't english and I cannot read the sarcasm at all in your texts.

I tried to help ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Good point.  Maybe not
---
We'll bring u, but expect u to do terrible damage.

He was dead, you cant type while dead. This is such a ridiculous debate
---
I have a guildie who, every time I ran with her in dungeons, complained about how low level my water was and didn't I have better yet whenever I gave her the stacks of conjured water.  
---
One day I finally got annoyed enough to say, "Well, if you don't like the water, just give it to &lt;party member&gt;."
---
And she responded with, "Oh, no, I didn't say I didn't like it.  It's still free!"
---
She stopped the incessant complaints after that. 
---
I realize I didn't personally make the water in real life slaving over a well with a bucket, but it's still pretty rude to complain about something free that someone did have to spend a while sitting there spamming a boring ass castbar, drinking, then spamming again to make.
---
They are train conductors..
---
melee will get you destroyed easier
---
Not as easy as that, is it..? If you have an arcane wand and +frost damage equipment, it's not gonna show up on the ranged damage on your character sheet. Your +10% frost damage talent is not gonna be reflected on the arcane damage on the wand either.
---
I'm just saying, if it shows your wand damage (pretty sure it is) then you can't just apply that to everything.
---
It happens every day. It's all very well if you're some kind of god tier tank coming in who can hold threat on all of Naxx just by fluttering their eyelashes, but most of us aren't. And the hell of it is, we shouldn't have to be as long as people would just work together and open a webpage to l2p.
---
Lol new mod coming to twitch one day; gen chat politics-blocker
---
People charge for profession and portals bc they go out of their way to do it 
---
As a tank u usually do it bc you’d do it anyways 
---
You can charge for running with low level people through instances 
---
There’s also rent a tank but to get people to pay you you’d need to be noticeably better than the average tank
---
How come there's only 1 mailbox in the entirety of undercity?
---
It always boggled my mind how few people use master looters in this game, guess there is no trust or its just too much of a hassle.
---
If an expensive BoE item drops, the only true fair thing to do is sell it and split the gold between the entire group.   It makes no sense that one person walks away with 200g and everyone else with chump change.   But who really wants fair?
---
So you shift out at low energy then back in to beat the energy regen timer?
---
Why would I pay for a tank?
---
That’s exactly the same
---
You still hitting the private server players button to much.
---
If you understand what i said...
---
Im saying. Long before private servers there was a game called world of warcraft, that many people played.
---
People that are also experts in the game and did all content over and over.
---
Somehow people think private server players are better players than the rest and so they are the guideline for whats to come...etc
---
About not having lifes... 
---
Are someone trying to tell me, that folks started in classic, got lvl 60 and got MC and Ony in the first week, have lifes, jobs (besides the ones payed to play)?
---
Me and other millions also played this game and its impossible you would play like this and have a "life".
---
Source: myself once a no lifer
---
shhh let him believe
---
How can it reduce player interaction. It can only enhance it.
---
With the addon : walk around the capital, check players, stop by the one, check his store, talk to him, bargain, trade. 
---
Without the addon : talking to an auction house.
---
Specially fo RP player not global chat, this is really a must have.
---
As a mage your best bet is gonna be AOE farming mob camps that have high value trash to sell, cats in badlands or STV both fit that but are hard to gather up for aoe farming, might be better to try some humanoids somewhere for the cloth that you can sell on AH for a decent bit if it’s silk or mageweave. Beyond that just stand in a city and offer ports once you get them or food/water and people will tip for something that costs you little effort or time. Good luck getting the mount!
---
It will probably go up in value when BGs and twinkling becomes a thing. I'm sitting on a pair of Feet of the Lynx for the same thing.
---
Even if it doesn't, we will have classic for a long time, and any gold lost in the long run will be negligible. It's only worth it if you're pushing for something specific, like a mount or a better item, but just having more gold for the sake of it is just meh.
---
I think it depends on the flightpath.  We're you two on the same course?
---
It's also the logo for shadowform, basically
---
Im not going to charge my guild, we've got a great community going and im basically second hand of the guild master, so thats a no go.  
---
But yeah im talking places like WC, rfc, sfk while you're lvl 40
---
Do the shaman resto talents that upgrade healing wave also affect lesser healing wave?
---
Are professions the only way to make money? Or can I take a (dungeon) farming approach for a similar amount of gold?
---
Open your spellbook, under the general tab go to the pet training skill (it has a sling icon), click on it and start training your pet using its training points.
---
Paraphrased: "No, I don't want to bother training my weaponskills properly."
---
Ok, good to know. Is this also mutually exclusive with regular enchantments? As in, enchantments made with the Enchanter profession?
---

PI is just so 💪
---
Why are you being intentionally obtuse?  
---
Bind on pick up items can only sold to vendors for (or disenchanted) small amounts of gold, meanwhile BoEs be worth hundreds gold, which someone who doesn't equip it can sell to buy their own BiS BoE.  
---
You're essentially saying that you're entitled to the dropped BoE because of the convenience of not having to go to the AH and buy it, and everyone else has to accept that they lost out on hundreds of gold because of your laziness.
---
how many versions of this fucking post do we need?

Do you play a tank? Cause i have tons of people i dont know whispering me all the time.

Yeah, I was going to mention the couple bad experiences I've had over the past couple weeks but figured I'd keep it positive. Only bad experiences I've had so far are limited to 5 mans though, and I've started picking up on the red flags... Well, that and people stealing my tags because I have no instant dmg but what are you gonna do?
---
If I had to guess either of the following
---
* Familiar with the class, recognised an ability being used available at a certain level
---
* A higher level player was around and he asked
---
For instance Dire Bear and Innervate at 40. Ravage and Ferocious Bite at 32. Perhaps even MotW rank.
---
Imagine that happening on retail. I can’t. Good on you.
---
2/10 banter.
---
When you get spell power gear (gear that says increases healing and damage done by spells by up to X amount) ele becomes very strong. Until you have that type of gear, stick with enhancement. But once you get that gear, it's very easy to kill most classes as elemental because your burst is just so high.
---
I mean it's a garbage blade anyway
---
The main benefit of having them on the same realm is that you can share gold and resources between them (same faction only) but it’s really up to you to decide how important that is to you
---
I get your point, but I think this stuff is so overblown. One step down from these items would not make the difference between the content being easy and hard.
---
num lock and both mouse buttons = my life
---
IS THAT FALSTAAD
---
Don't care what it says, nobody swallows snus in Sweden the land of its origin. You put the snus under your lip, when you are done with it you put it in the circular box in a corner or under the top lid some of them have. It's not about whether it's dangerous to swallow or not
---
It's not even a taunt, it just creates slightly more aggro than a basic attack.
---
Well now I can't unsee that.   God damn perception.
---
This. As much as you won’t do as much dps as other classes you bring DPS with your buffs (an extra 10+ Dps with might at 40 per a melee, 25mp5) you can offheal and damage mitigate with BoP/ divine shield and possess great abilities in cleanse, redemption and divine intervention (situational wipe saver). A lot of people are too set in their ways to believe that retri pallys are good, but the amount of utility is godly and makes the run a lot easier for other players. Screw the haters, paladins are a great asset to have in a group.
---
Maybe paladin?
---
What? 
---
The Need before Greed system is, and always has been, a vital part of WoW etiquette. If someone actually needs a drop for their set/ toon development, that BY FAR supersedes my desire to sell that item for 10 gold. You should all have a chance at the spoils for your class, yes. If a plate chest were to drop, I wouldn't have the same right to it as the warrior/ pala in my group. 
---
If this specific group agreed among themselves to go another route and everyone was on board, that's fine. But implying that Needing items you actually ***need*** means you're being a dick or something is ridiculous.

But what if the tank doesn’t have a ranged weapon and I’m just wanding/bow shooting them to Aggro the pack to bring it to the tank.
---
Hi!  
---
First, thank you for these great macros.
---
*I also want to take the time and let people  know that someone here* ***( @Hunterkil2 )*** *made a macro and was'nt sure if it was working as intended. Mainly, it is casting* ***Hawk if in combat*** *or* ***Cheetah if not in combat****, and it is working as intended. Here is the line if someone is looking for it:*
---
*/cast \[combat\]\[harm,nodead\] !Aspect of the Hawk; \[dead\]\[help\]\[noexists\] !Aspect of the Cheetah*
---
Second; I am looking for a macro that will **cast serpent sting if the target has rage or energy**, and cast **viper sting if the target has mana**. Anyone can help me on this ?
---
Thanks for the grinding spots, imo some could work for hordies such as me! Will try the raptors at dustwallow marsh
---
In the spellbook I have on the righ side: general, bm, marksms and survival. On the bottom there is spellbook and pet. When I click on pet, nothing shows up except my “cowering” skill from the bat I’m currently using. Despite having learned several skills at the pet trainer, it doesn’t show any skills in this pet menu. Unless I’m looking at the wrong tab ofc.
---
Exactly.
---
Am I having a stroke or is your character like, contorting crazily?
---
It's a bannable offense, easy as that. I'm not sure what you're trying to defend here. 
---
Saying that it's stupid isn't going to make it better.
---
Unless you're helping a much lower level party in a dungeon that gives you 0 xp and 0 loot there is no reason to give a party member money. You benefit just as much as being there as anybody else since the fact remains you can't solo it. In the case of mage portals, portals cost runes runes cost money. as far as professions go people usually tip because A the person making the item meets them somewhere B the person had to grind and get that skill up and C they can't do it themselves
---
Jesus this has been reposted 10times or so in the past 20min...
---
Looking at YouTube it looks like elemental can with the aoe fire totem, some chain lightnings (like one at pull and one NS+cl?), but it looks pretty scuffed. Still, as long as the mobs die.
---
Cause u just woke up :))
---
Dont forget to apply hots on yourself before pulling. Makes aoe tanking a joke.
---
&gt; Just to make sure... There haven't been any announcements by Blizzard to add the option to disable experience gain? When they did this and separated BG's between those with XP on and those with XP off, it completely ruined twinking since it was nearly impossible to even get a low lvl WSG or AB game started.
---
If the majority of the players are 60, then only twinks will be in lower battlegrounds, which is why twinking died due to a lack of easy targets.
---
You are making a 6 month to a year investment without knowing if twinking will be viable.  Who is making dumb comments now?  Odds are, there won't be a steady stream of new players like before.  Which means, once the game matures, low levels will be a ghost town.  And without xp, there is even less reason to play pvp below 40.
---
Go ahead and back on twinking being big and then cry to blizzard when you struggle to get matches without both teams 100% twinked out.
---
Until phase 3 and you are a PvP god.
---
The mods have been deleting stuff anywhere from pretty soon after the post is up to 11 hours after the post has been created, is on the front page, and has several hundred comments. This will probably get deleted later today.

This guy missed some information over the past 15 years.

Whereabouts are you located? PRC? I thought they had a different subscription model that wouldn't work with classic WoW

but like, isn't it just like a strictly better option? running with guildies or not...
---
Well... Not rly your problem... Is it?....
---
38 is really where the damage of drain life takes off. That's rank four iirc. Before then it does less damage than the gravestone scepter wand. You want to go affliction and partly into demo until then.

I most likely will.. I see a few people got interested... So figure why not right ^^

Something be doing?

thanks for the info.  what level would you say shamans begin to be a force for wpvp.  as looking forward to just bullying asap XD

So like... if you used your tank like a vanilla tank.

Their dot healing is amazing. Good direct healing too and very nice buffs. Only downside is healing.

This was on the Yojamba server?

I mean fat steroid humans are so creative tho

Even if you could disable the markers in retail, the bigger problem is that they don't bother writing directions in the quest text anymore, since the map tells you exactly where to go. You'd literally have no information to go off of.
---
Just enjoy a joke for being a joke. No need to look into it that deeply.

I think you can say the same about dungeon farming though, I have been in one single aoe farm run in brd that was actually a bit effective. All the other runs (sm, zf included) people fucked it up so much that I was wondering if a normal run wouldn't have been faster.

Well some people buy those items. Maybe it's those peoplethat roll need on them. In the end every piece is going to replaced except out BiS after naxx. So why not roll on this if its an upgrade that makes your life easier. Even if it's for 1 lvl.

Did you buy it?

Didn't you notice how barely anyone complains about the graphics not beeing original? Or that we start with 1.13 while the content that was available then will probably take months to arrive (again)? Or how people want stuff removed that existed in vanilla because of the "spirit of classic"?
---
It’s worth it if you can get the pieces for a good price, I found it much cheaper to buy the shadow silk and get someone to make the pieces rather then buy the overpriced 8g/piece off the AH. It won’t get replaced until felcloth which is lvl 53-58 I believe.
---
We did this quest yesterday with a 5 horde, 5 alliance party. We communicated by emotes. It was pretty fun. Pretty much everyone, both ally and horde got carried by a 51lvl rogue. Here is a screenshot

Questie is literally just a really fast wowhead lookup, which is what you'd be doing without the mod anyway. I see no issues with using it, and it's not like the mod will turn a 10 day leveling experience into a 3 day one. I'm still not even lvl 40.
---
Spirit has no place in a warlocks gear.  Regardless of your build, if you are constantly casting, draining, lifetapping, pulling, you are not outside the 5 second rule.  And if you are, you can cast more with higher life and tap for mana.
---
Warlocks don't need spirit and anyone who tells you otherwise leveled on a private server.
---
I agree with you but I don't think it's a good starting point compared to just going with Classic.
---
I really like the Sunken Temple Hakkar quest chain. Lots of travel, some cool mystery, and Hakkar feels like a very real threat.
---
I'm in the mainland but I don't have an account here. Just been seeing quite a few adverts for classic's release here.
---
Charge for anything, people dont have to accept. As long as you let them know ahead of time its fair imo. People may find it ridiculous but tanking is the most stressful/reactive role compared to other classes. Alot more than making food or summoning portals. So why not charge?
---
Is there any sense on how long it will take for the economy to stabilize? 
---
When I played last, (quit before the first expansion) I could sell unwanted stuff on the AH, but now I can't sell anything and some items are listed for lower than what a vendor would give you.
---
Gnomer :)... Sm u dont take on many mobs...
---
Or that you're just not eligible for, so you have to stare at it on your map and get excited every time you think there's a new quest but forgot that you can't get it.

I dont know who told you warriors are good for open pvp, but they are literally the joke of pvp until they are decked in ATLEAST some of the hard to get gear in the game. They do not scale well until 60, and thats only with good raiding gear. If you dont raid then im sorry to say, pvp will be very difficult against others of the same gear level.
---
In classic wow, warriors are unfortuantly outclassed by nearly any ranged class. This is due to them having only one in combat gap closer (intercept) every 30 seconds. However most range classes have multiple disengages that are under 30 seconds, which means as a warrior it is very possible to be forever straffed in pvp.  Its not until you can get good gear that you will be able to burst down people before they run
---
kekbur or burkek?

Then you check AH and its selling for only 15g

Ran into an old raid mate of mine from BC/WOTLK days too on Atiesh!  What a kick!  I was his guild master for years until I quit.  We did raids together several times per week but never got really friendly beyond raiding.  We just said hi and what a coincidence it was.  Then moved on.

It doesn't make Strength worth 2.2 ap. It just increases your strength. What you said was incorrect and misleading.

Whatever

The immolate ends in the end of the battle, so even if the immolate is the last one casted i still get 100% of the spell damage + less aggro.
---
level tends to make a huge difference, so I wouldnt worry until youre at 60, comparing to other 60s.
---
you probably shouldnt be able to CoA much in dungeons, especially in BRD everything dies really fast, but if its getting full duration it should good.

Raid/dungeon spec are basically the same thing. I assume youre doing this, but you didnt mention it, Nightfall procs come before everything, so when Nightfall comes up, Shadowbolt immediately.

You know what you explained is a solo player/matching making right?  No longer did anyone care about the other players and just que for a instance no one EVER talks in. Long winded post for no reason mate what you explained is exactly what a solo player mmo would be.

&gt;you criticized vanilla? REEEEE GO BACK TO RETAIL!!!

Good community.

It's 1.12, not 1.0. Balance is bad, as is Ret Paladin. Mixing in feral druids, Shadow Priestd, and what not are actuality good things. People have an odd and distorted view of where we ended up at in vanilla. I was there, MTing as a druid.
---
Best to roll a character starting with the letter A because the player with the first name alphabetically wins the tie rolls.

www.macroexplain.com

This is a great resource for players writing macros, particularly those who are inexperienced. You copy and paste your macro into this web site, and it will tell you, in plain text, what the macro will do. It will also let you know how much room you have to expand the macro, if you go over the 255 character limit, and if you have any errors. This site does have some limitations: it is not up to date on many of the more recent syntax changes, and it is missing a large amount of spell data, but the basic functionality works very well.

Yea i havent been able to figure this out ethier it only shows the computer i am on not the profile i want it to sync to!

60 lock here. I stayed with Succy until around mid 40s, then switched to Imp once I got some spell power and dark pact.

Well played

nah dude Humongous will not be reported for non rp. the reporting happens for names like Imahealu and bullshit like that.

Why are you poking his crotch?

unless you're a human!

That's why Classic is more difficult than BfA, generally speaking. It's not that the mechanics are hard, it's that the game is way more punishing compared to modern WoW. The mobs hit harder, so there's that small chance of death looming.  Unlike modern WoW, crowd control has some importance, and pulling more than 1 mob at a time is a guaranteed death. 
---
Classic's punishing approach encourages players to pay attention to their surroundings, use CC, and upgrade gear whenever they can. Warriors are so dependent on their gear that missing out on an upgrade can really hurt them.
---
Succ was always defensive and I couldn’t manually tell it to do anything
---
It sucks to get griefed
---
Well if you’re strong enough to be worth it ofc you can post rent a tank in the lfg or general chat name your price and see what happens
---
Wait until you start pulling agro off it.. and believe me it wont be long before you do

You can only imagine how many times they wiped after this, if they even finished at all with how he was playing lmao

Every single time lifetap comes up on Reddit people tell the healers to let them bandage and do not worry about keeping the entire damn party at 100% health. That isn't your job. 
---
Your job is to keep people alive. 
---
Dps have abilities to keep themselves alive and they need to use them. Your ability to keep the group alive is to focus heal MT with small backup heals on dps as permitting.
---
And me, at least, I accept the fact that by griefing, they may call in the guildie reinforcements on me. I kinda hope for those awesome big scale world pvps that pop up because of those little interactions. I kill you, you kill me. I mean, I don't repeatedly go after someone unless they come at me and I feel like they're interested in a few bouts, I'm more of a one off fuck with you and then go fuck with someone else while I'm questing or something.
---
I like the swords! What are they?
---
This is just some salty shit right here. Sounds like you recently got fucking wrecked.
---
See you when AQ is cleared before reset.
---
I'm lvl 31 and really consider not putting points into sword spec because I don't know what weapons will drop. Thoughts?
---
xD all good
---
Hey Toas comes before You...I'm just saying
---
Yeah its not like it breaks the games economy or griefs other legitemate players preventing them from farming BiS pieces.. I'm sure that doesn't hurt anyone at all. Idiot.
---
I have a rogue specific question that I am hoping somebody can answer; At around level 30 I am thinking of speccing into Master of Deception and pickpocket farming SM for my mount gold. I know this was quite an efficient way to make gold on private servers but does anybody know if this is worth it on the liver servers or if the values are much lower than private servers?
---
Go Wawrgs!
---
Ok, keep us updated, because we care.  
---
Said no one ever.
---
Please, do not litter this subreddit with worthless loot/achievement posts.
---
Ive never tried Succ, is it really that good?
---
Okay say you have 100 strength, that gives 50 AP.
---
Now say you are Alliance, have a paladin in your group, and have 100 strength. Well now you actually have 110 strength, or 55 AP. And that scales. So each point of strength is worth more AP with a paladin than without.
---
Are you the league of legends lore youtube guy?

I just remembered that after i finished laughing, i told my guild to share the fun story. They all asked why tf i was getting shit from someone with such a pathetic name hahahahah
---
Have you checked your settings? There is a checkbox in settings for selfcasting
---
I feel like Ironforge has been mostly empty while I'm on different layers and that it's possibly a horde dominated server. Razorgore EU. I like being in the minority because it allows for more and easier to find wPvP but the layering makes the cities feel way dead than it should be.
---
Is it really that good? I've never tried using it
---
I feel like the only character that should have gotten their own model for classic, it should be chromie.
---
then i'd suggest making a new ticket and stating that you tried using the item restoration but it didnt show up
---
best of luck
---
Lmao I love how people didn’t realize you were being sarcastic.

---
People used that buff on vanilla, especially for rag or Vael. People that didn't know that didn't play vanilla
---
It's not "technically" against the rules, it's against the rules. It's unfair on literally everyone else on the server that needs to farm mats you cockwomble - you'd definitely be crying to Blizz support if you got ganked out of an area whilst ppl on your faction were nearby and suspiciously did nothing lmfao.
---
Level 30 is when it starts to shine with windfury, and level 40 with the enhancement shaman attack. Since windfury can proc off itself, there can be instances where you will do 5x+ the damage off of one auto attack which will usually kill most cloth based classes after using a spell or two after
---
Tanks that need everything to be perfectly organized and sanitary are lousy tanks that are insecure about their abilities.

No need to feel bad if it was a upgrade

Yes! I've specced into improved succ, and she can actually hold aggro long enough to kill something

Is slow speed good for rogues?

This is on Zandalari Tribe, the EU RPPVP

Seems like cross faction collusion to me which is against game ToS. Just use the neutral AH that's in the game.

Nop, EU French Sulfuron
---
Can u please share WTF archieves? I will award you with important internet points.
---
Haha oh dear. I bought one for 14g when the servers were fresh, sold for my mount at 40. Easy flip! 
---
I remember then selling for 1k+ in vanilla once people had their mounts purchased and paying for things became the luxury, as opposed to farming.
---
Glad the new realms are picking up. Hopefully it keeps growing a bit this weekend. Earthfury at 10.5K as well, it’s obviously not as fast finding groups as a mega server but it’s also nice running into the same people everywhere.
---
pserver player here. hell no. and if i ever did get bored of WoW classic id go back to BDO or something.
---
I bind W key to toggle autorun.
---
That works from a phone interesting..
---
Why? We do not kill NPC like Hemet Nesingwary or Nat Pagle, do we?   
---
Being on another faction  ≠ blind kill rage
---
I am enlightened
---
also gain 15% less physical damage taken
---
Do you not have a tab button on your keyboard? If this is such a big hurdle for you, then you are right. The class may be too hard for you.
---
that seems pretty good is there any other classes that come even close to that?
---
Why do you write stupid shit like this
---
Yes, slow main hand is better. Your skill based on weapon damage will hit harder
---
I would argue that of all the years i've played wow, the most iconic "worst alliance skum" are always male nightelf hunters with a moustache or bald male human mage. Not sure why these specific types of alliance characters always want to fuck you over while you are afk or fighting 2 mobs.
---
Nothing impressive here, not even a little bit.
---
You do not know how many people hold the same opinion.
---
You have your own opinion as well, yet you do the same.
---
Turn your hypocrisy off.
---
Eh, every server has bad and good. Me and two friends were farming gnolls last night, and helped probably five individuals kill hogger, even though we didn't need him. Sorry this one experience was less than ideal for you!
---
Very awesome post!
---
Idk what youre trying to say and maybe im saying it too, but the people who play like that, who rush and rush and rush to things are normally the ones who quit out early
---
Do people actually use reddit on their computers tho?
---
Good luck vendoring mid-tear item for 50 gold. Dumbass.
---
And I'm saying I disagree with the rule. Grouping up in an MMO should never be bannable.
---
Yes skinning is nice. High level bag/tailoring recipes will even require some leather, so I actually find it helpful anyways.
---
Ooo I love that they have this reputation.
---
What are the differences you want reverting?
---
I can't believe I'm already having to ask for Classic Classic WoW within a month of release of Classic WoW
---
You’re probably gonna call me “toxic” for this, but your comment is ridiculous. People play on PvP servers because, get this, they enjoy PvP. Maybe if you’re having so many bad interactions on a PvP realm, you should ask yourself if your behaviour is part of the problem. I’ve had nothing but good experiences so far, aside from 2 ninjas and a guy who was acting like a dick. There are trolls on any server...
---
Do you have autoloot on?
---
Just got to wetlands for the first time too, looks awesome !
---
What are advertisements?
---
Honestly the last mount that excited me was merc glad armoured netherdrake
---
This mentality has been around since I started playing near the end of Vanilla.
---
There's also a skeleton of one of the turtle mounts with the decoration on the shell on the beach near BFD
---
It’ll be worth hundreds in p3. But yea it still isn’t a big deal, enjoy the game!
---
Hahahahaha typical. Attacks you as you peacefully walk past and your back is turned. Not surprised in the slightest
---
Don’t take tailoring. The cloth is worth more sold as raw material vs a crafted item in almost every case. 
---
Skinning is fine, but you generally will not be farming skinnable mobs at 60 for max gold per hour.
---
Herb/mining is worthwhile and better than any others from a pure gold perspective.
---
In the current state as a pure gold per hour ratio a good group clearing LBRS or BRD will yield the most.
---
I just hit 38 last night at the end of my session. Can't wait to get back on tonight!
---
Hobbs would have done it right.
---
All of a sudden I have the need to purge the scourge from Azeroth
---
100 strength gives 200 ap not 50. So with kings it gives 220 ap not 55. Other than that, you are correct. You can look at strength as 2.2 ap if you know you will have kings.
---
Lo-Pan??
---
...history does not agree with you.
---
Oh please, do tell us what vaunted changes you don’t like thus far...
---
I'm horde and I spend a large portion of my time either ignoring allies or helping them out if I see they're about to get killed by a mob. It doesn't keep them from ganking me continually though. So both sides act about the same
---
I'm on Firemaw EU and Ironforge looks like the photo above.
---
what we learned is to ROLL ASAP! first one rolls with the tie number gets it! :P
---
Although you do want to take into account the increase you’d instead get from Might, especially an Improved Might. You’d need to have a _lot_ of Strength to justify Kings over Might on a class that uses Strength for DPS
---
Don't play bfa, can't go back.
---
Should travel to Sweden and buy and swallow it then to try.
---
Under lip and then you take it out.
---
You can swallow but it's not meant to be like that and will taste bad. 
---
As a fellow swede who have tried it I know you should not do it though and I have no idea why that site have made up new rules.

It’s awful on prot warrior

Is there a way to configure questie so it only tells you where you can pick up new quests? I don't want an add-on to hold my hand, but I wouldn't mind knowing how and where to maximize rep gains through quests.
---
Oh yeah with all the battlegrounds that are out?
---
What is numlock for?
---
You seem a bit heated on layering, sure a separate category may be fine, but by no means will jokerd's time not be beaten on a non-layerinf server in the future. 
---
Jokers total time is likely an hour longer with no layering, if you actually watched his stream you'd realise it's not as big of an issue as you seem to believe.
---
Oh look, another retail baby warlock lol
---
Classic doesn't even have all of its content yet.... 
---
Once BGs are in, I'll be hooked forever.
---
I would go talk to the pet trainer every 6 levels or so. Also remember you have to tame new beasts to get new or upgraded abilities.
---
Even if it's an upgrade, would they purchase it from the AH? If no, then they don't really need it that badly at all do they?
---
Holy shit the NaCl is heavy here
---
Lost the BFD staff to a tank. Or maybe it was the WC one. Either way I wasn't impressed.
---
The two games are so vastly different honestly. 
---
One month of classic will be upon us shortly and the game isn’t showing signs of dying out in such short order
---
I thought once "how could I get any lazier than hitting num-lock and periodically correcting my heading in wow?". You just gave me the answer, I could have remapped numlock to save myself 1/4 second
---
Ever do crack?  This is similar.
---
Humans don’t care if it’s swords or maces.
---
If you disagree with rules of the game then don't play it. And since you are apparently playing it - you have already accepted them. So either follow them, or don't bitch about getting banned when breaking them.
---
It's 9:30 AM on a Saturday.....
---
Then you overgeared the content and had PUG members that actually knew how to play their classes well.
---

Are you on your knees
---
Kid or idiots... or people that want to avoid ninja looters ya douche
---
I want a server that gets left untouched. warlock infernals, and priest mind control on boats are two examples that I can think of things that already have been changed. 
---
people that don't want anything changed and are okay with the true classic experience could stay on those servers, and the ones that want quality of life changes could stay on the current servers. Allow transfers as they have been.
---
I know the guys personally but ok
---
What makes you automatically assume this? The majority of people who are like this do it because of aesthetic reasons. Not everyone cares about meta or if they are doing the most dps that they can, its a game.
---
Nah. Having WAY more fun on my classic toons than I ever did on retail... so much that I haven't touched retail at all lately, and I just now started an alt in classic.
---
Can't imagine myself playing retail until the next xpac.
---
Tried this and it didnt work. The folders do not get made for him
---
Humans are arguably the best PvE melee race for the Alliance as well due to Mace/Sword specialization.
---
That hand is talent from Witcher 1
---
Difference between hunter and warlock: 
---
A warlock pet can hold aggro on a single mob you're fighting on your own, if you carefully manage your damage output. 
---
A hunter pet can hold aggro on a boss in LBRS while your entire group is trying to kill it, while the tank is polymorphed.
---
how did u find eggs and clams at that lvl?
---
How come?
---
Warlock infernals and priest mind control. All within a month of release, what'll it be a year from now?
---
In LoL my friend and I ended up running into a guy that lived in the dorms at the college we went to.
---
Sure but honestly but warlocks pull better and do damage, hunters are just a shit version of warlocks and there isn't a lack of warlocks since you only want 1 per group.
---
Five sunders before dps!
---
Most likely wouldn't be lagging. But most of the mobs would be spawn camped. Pserver launches had like 10 times more people packed into each zone. Classic launch felt a like dying pserver thanks to layering.
---
Shift+w
---
I’m with you man some people just don’t get it. Needing most BoE items to equip them is a waste. All need avoids the drama
---
Hunters doing weird shit again.
---
Bullshit, that motherfucker is the worst taunter/tank in the game.
---
Retail lol. Haven’t touched it since like mists. And during og Classic I Main’d Druid and healed the entire time. Funnily enough I didn’t get but hurt about warlocks using a class ability. Just healed. It went really well.
---
I keep hearing this and it is simply not true.  I put 3 dots on a mob and then either drain life or drain soul and VW keeps aggro.  It's not until I use my wand after 2-4 shots that I get aggro.  It's like other said, 3 points into imrpoved VW goes a long way.
---
How is that the same logic at all??? Conmunicating cross faction is the issue here, that's always been against PvP server policies which is why you can only make chars on ONE faction on them, having ppl on both factions communicating outside of WoW to manipulate in game resources is 100% bannable - if it was a group of only Horde players doing this it would be fine, just get a bigger ally group to deal with them, that's the spirit of the game. It's not "grouping up", it's circumventing one of the core mechanics of the server type, use some brain cells and stop downplaying it you flannel.
---
VW is not tank, VW is crowd control. You send him in first to tie down mobs you aren't attacking and to hold the one you are attacking in place until you get your spells out. 
---
Aggro four mobs, explode them one by one with immolate-corruption-shadow bolt-shadowburn. By the time your current target switches over to you and starts running in your direction, they're already dead (Nani?!).
---
If you're at the bank, you know that one ramp leads to FP, and the other ramp leads to the mailbox.
---
Now to remember how to get to the reagent vendor quickly cause fuuuck
---
I know the guys personally. Yes they did dungeon grind but none knew the ideal way to dungeon grind.
---
And yes they played on pservers, of course we all did. That doesn't mean we knew how MC would be, becuase it was massively different.. and way easier.
---
i feel like deeps doesnt even matter in classic. its not about pulling high numbers or anything. its about going smoothly. like tacically pulling monsters so you dont end up overwhelmed. giving the tank some time to position and build up aggro. then killing them one by one based on priority. all of that leads to a smooth run without any deaths or wipes and i like being smooth
---
He and the other guest came off like insufferable dorks. Neat to see one has be proven to be one.

That's right, my b my b. Got me numbers flipped!

The cycling affixes are what make it entertaining and keep it fresh for me.  The +10 affix completely changes how you do each dungeon from season to season.
---
I guess everyone that reads the front page is going to submit this today...
---
I haven’t seen any changes to these, care to elaborate?  Only change (and it was a bug fix) I remember being announced was demo shout spam aggro.
---
ikr? It reads just like what Trump sounds like when he talks. 
---
&gt; And then something magical happend.. I saw the chest... I went to it... It always has a green or 2.. Even dropped 2 blues once... And then i soled 2 bosses with pots, cds and a lot of kiteing...... And ran up to a total of 4-5g per run.. And it takes 30 mins! And grinded about 14 15k exp... Im delighted!
---
I saw it coming as someone who’s played OSRS since launch.   Efficiency-scape is in full effect in classic.
---
I got everything I needed off the AH for pretty cheap.
---
I leveled a warlock to 50~ before classic was announced.
---
Was rocking Imp the entire time. Void is for babies.
---
Say the edge masters hand guards drop, one of the most valuable BoE’s. That’s an example of all needing being the policy, because of its 1k gold value
---
Why? The are so cute and tiny :D
---
Just give it time. Purchase those items listed lower than vendor and either sell on AH or vendor for easy profit. If there’s a ton of stuff listed barely above vendor price it’s better to just vendor those items. Everyone is still leveling and items are constantly coming in and out of demand as the majority of players leave certain level groups. Just find what items are going to be worth something during endgame and hold onto them until they have some value, ie: wicked claw, elemental air, earth, etc
---
Laughs in never getting a single raid invite?
---
Ok, I have to try this today. thanks!
---
You’re entitled to ask and I’m entitled to tell you to piss off 😂
---
No post needed either - this gets posted every 10 min
---
Brilliant screen shot, gz
---
What happens then? Is it alphabetic or goes on roll order?
---
But blizzard told us people weren't abusing layering and we were niave to think they were
---
Why stare at tiny screen when you can stare at big screen
---
Unrelated: i would have found funny as hell if chromie had the updated retail character model for gnomes
---
...but they lacked vision.
---
I've not seen it on my servers, either an American thing? Or a Reddit thing? If you are going to equip it need it imo
---
Get this to the front page, this is the high quality content we need
---
Oh no active grieving got patched 
---
(Haven’t seen any confirmation on this whatsoever) 
---
Did you try it out yourself did you see it ? Was there a Blue post or sth ?
---
I really don't understand the hate of a lower population server. Enjoy your epic queues especially come p2 when they remove layering and dump you all on one layer. Hope you can no life and farm everything you need now. So best of luck. Smell ya later loser.
---
MC on the boats works.
---
You're trolling
---
Yeah, but you would just get trolls instead. Needing shit they can use just to vendor or disenchant or whatever. That would be even more infuriating. I say keep it as it is.
---
Awkward. The guy who lost posted the roll too.
---
Is it supposed to be difficult to find PUGs for low level instances? I’ve ran RFC, WC, and SFK like 2 times or so each but it seems world chat and the big cities are out leveled and all asking for SM, ZF, etc.
---
??
---
Because their time is more valuable than someone else, even if that person is doing more important things for the group (like tanking or healing)
---
It makes absolutely no sense, and then you see these BoE sit on the AH at “end game server” prices, never fucking selling.
---
Ehh.. I’d rather have more jersey shore references playing goblin and have fucking cars to drive around.
---
Go back to BFA? Are you trolling?
---
BFA Is literally dogshit compared to Classic
---
Oh look, a wild asshole who makes assumptions appears! In Vanilla I was in the top PvP guild on my server and reached Warlord (not HWL), and in TBC I was over 2300 in 2s and 3s. Suck it
---
Tirion fording questline in EPL is a must for everything but casters, and its long as fuck with plenty of exp.
---
Onyxia prequest for ally has a bit to do before going into dungeons, however I would honestly recommend doing dungeon runs from 55 with as many quests as possible. That is really good exp and it will start you out on attunements and prebis.
---
Nice try, Kejo
---
The Priest mind control still works. It's some kind of bug.
---
Just use Westfall and Loch Modan with a Deadmines run or two.
---
I say “ALL NEED”, but if someone already greeded I say “ALL GREED”.
---
Hold onto it, and if anything buy the cheap ones on the AH, in a few months when there is none available you can have a mini monopoly on it lol, I bought a butchers blade for 3g50s eventually when the market stabilizes and people start making twinks it's going to sell for a ton.
---
What's the addon for the scrolling combo points indicator?:)
---
yikes
---
Wow I had to zoom in to make sure that wasn't Lo Pan.
---
But did you help him with his tigresses??
---
This is an honest question ... doesn’t popping cheetah drop the flag? Was that changed later?
---
I exhaled amusedly
---
That's why it's a bug because it's inconsistent. I have had this happen to me.
---
Oh wow.......impressive 8====D. I'm still not wrong though 🤷‍♀️
---
Edgemaster Handguards are relevant for weapon skill which is only good for hitting raid bosses because they're a higher level than you.
---
People buy BoE epics for either twinking or when they want to level an alt in style and they've got gold to waste. Similar to how you shouldn't be getting Fiery enchanted on your leveling weapons because your gold is better spent elsewhere, but if you're leveling an alt and got gold to spend then why not.
---
If you think there is more to do in BFA...im sorry my friend. You are lost and i hope you find your way home.
---
Innocent until proven guilty? The mods censor witch hunts for a reason
---
Hm space beard.. That could be another name for our retail crystal snorting dwarf... Heal the woooons! Snoooort... Champion!
---
Just want to comment on possibly this subs highest voted post early.
---
Too slow. You want fast weapon for prot.
---
What is that audio?
---
The easiest way to rank a weapon vs another is the dps (damage per second), regardless of the speed.
---
10 dps 1sec speed will hit for 10 on each strike 
---
10 dps 2sec speed will hit for 20 on each strike
---
So on 10sec of hitting, it’s the same. But for your skills that does damage based on weapon strike damage, slower is better because it will 20 + x instead of 10 + x.
---
Well, that's fine if you enjoy that, but many of us just want to get going tbh.
---
Casual racism is hilarious, I think you shoved that moral high-horse of yours way too far up your posterior
---
You might have better luck by searching your realm forums for a realm discord or other server channels that aren't /LFG.
---
Otherwise, I would join a large active guild with people my level or start searching for groups in the zones and levels areas relative to that dungeon.
---
Their race is undead, their faction is The Forsaken. 
---
Just like most, there are other unplayable factions of their race, but in gameplay circumstances (creating a character, mousing over someone), it only refers to their race, not their faction.
---
We put it back in a special lid and then throw it in a garbage bin or something.
---
Most likely the snus you have is a mild version of snus and not the real kind we have in Sweden I would guess
---
Not true. I was mind-controlled off the boat from BB to Ratchet this morning. Roughly 4 hours ago.
---
Yeah, questie allows you to only turn on turn in/pick up locations. 
---
Also, I feel you in the no hand holding thing. I use Questie, but I turned the minimap icons to the smallest they could be set and now I can’t even see them. The only thing I see is the turn in/pick up icons (and sometimes mob locations when I get lost) on the map itself. I.e. it doesn’t add anything to my minimap, but it adds markers to the overall map.
---
you all should've rolled need to prevent ninjas
---
This is already 130g on my server

fair enough.

But laughs in the fact that tranq shot isn't needed at all because magmadar hits like a wet noodle.
---
I feel ya, did the same with 5 hordied and their Araj quest. Trapped one, viper sting and pet on heals. They shot first.
---
And the tank who tanked your dungeon for you?
---
Fuck HIM!
---
small eggs flame sacs wicked claws spider silk

How has it broken the economy lol. Devilsaur skin has broken the economy?

Wouldn’t vpn be a way Around That? I believe you can change your country that way (never used a vpn so I’m not sure
---
And a lot of people like their characters to look ‘pretty’.
---
I’m from the Souls/Bloodborne community though so mine are all as ugly as fucking possible.
---
Why vendor green weapons and d/e green armor?
---
I just don't see the issue of people creating monopolies on certain items? It literally happens in every other MMO. I play OSRS and here you have entire clans of 200 people camping a specific area and then making other people pay gold if they want to enter the area and kill the mobs in it.
---
I think it's great if people can form groups organized enough to control resources. If you can't form your own group you can buy it. I just don't agree with the idea that anyone should have access to any boss/resource at any time, that's how we got welfare epics in BFA.
---
Skinning would have been great for earning money while leveling. Herbalism and alchemy will be great money-makers once more people are 60 and start running high-level dungeons and raids, as well as PvP. Right now it probably wouldn't make you very much. However, you could use alchemy to make health and mana potions that improve your survivability and sustain, thereby improving your leveling speed.
---
Incendius (pvp) feels very alliance dominated, standing in gadgetzan there are 5 alliance for every 1 horde at the moment, hillsbrad was the same, so was Desolace and STV...
---
&gt; They can already out threat them just as is in the game, they have no mitigation and can't maintain themselves in long af fights due to Mana.
---
As a Shaman Tank who has reached Naxx, I can tell you mana is not an issue in an organised group.
---
Where are you rushin?
---
I wouldn’t ‘farm’, just continue levelling as gold earnt increase so as you level up. Gold earnt at 60 is much quicker than at 40
---
Yeah the other post about this has way more people saying this...  I don't understand it. Like wtf if an amazing item drops for my priest idgaf if you can see it for 700g and get a good item for your warrior. This is literally THE item for my priest. I should have priority to it. Or what?
---
Under that system I'm either supposed to:
---
A) grind a dungeon for a 1/1000 drop and hope I beat 4 others who can't use it.
---
B) hope I win some warrior bis chest or two handed axe to sell to buy my staff from the guy who took my item?
---
It's just people trying to justify their greed.
---
What seal is best for leveling a paladin?
---
The average american adult male is 5'9" and 195 lbs. That's crazy.
---
Plus there's no ranged taunts and very ranged threat moves for tanks in Classic
---
But most of the time, the epics that drop are a few levels down. Plus, isn’t Nightblade 39? It would be a shame if a 45 warrior was the only one who got to roll on Nightblade because it had like 5 extra DPS over their level 43 blue. 
---
That’s a huge waste of money and resources. Like equipping staff of Jordan at level 42... you can get a good staff pretty easily and save yourself 300g in the process.
---
If you want a pure classic experience where the game never changes go play a private server. The best way to have a dead game is have it literally end in 6 months because get fed up with the lack of content or balance. Yes I think BC changes some things for the worse, but they also made things a lot better. Also there has been just 0 confirmation on if this is a but or intentional. Like take a chill pill honestly.
---
I invite everyone I can.  But yea, people rude af this time around.  Still nice people out there though.
---
Guys we can beat it, pm me and let's set up a 6 separate but similar threads about losing/winning a roll. It'll be so crazy that even the 6th guy who wasn't in the dungeon will know about it from chat, and post it too
---
No, speed equals more exp per session.
---
We did that the other day. 3 42 hunters and 2 rogues. We barely did it. One of the random guys was even multi boxing 2 hunters. Amazing feeling killing them since it was a level 50 elite quest.
---
I found classic more fun to start with :) (Or well, I started with TBC).
---
If you go to sleep dead do you wake up alive?
---
This is 100% up to you.
---
You can either offer for free for your benefit and charity of others, you can ask for a tip and most people will leave something although it will vary, or start with a low fair amount.  If you ask too much, you'll know due to lack of interest.
---
I was mistaken then, believed what I saw on that hot post. 
---
Sorry all
---
People kite npcs around all the time
---
Yep, literally not even an hour ago it dropped for me and had a feral dps win the roll. 
---
I’m a rogue.
---
Depending on server it might sell for 1 thousand or more
---
I wasn't taking either side, was just asking for peoples' opinions. BFA is the reason I hadn't been able to hold a sub for more than 2 months. Just got so old.
---
I have nothing against people that play on PvP servers, I used to play on one. But you are missing my point. I’m not saying all players on PvP realms are antisocial, far from. It is just more likely to run in a rude person on a PvP realm than on a PvE realm. That’s what I’ve learned the last 15 years. And yes, there are also sociopaths on PvE servers. 
---
My point is that the nature of a PvP realm speaks more to the typical antisocial person than a PvE realm. Not because all people on PvP realms are dicks, but because of the ‘I’m better than you’-factor. Turns out they aren’t and vent by being a dick.
---
Some say they're still trying to kill hogger with the dab debuff.

heres the door please see yourself out and dont come back

---
I like this variation of 30/0/21.
---
It takes improved fire totems and call of flame, whilst sacrificing 2% off lightning spells. I think this is a good trade because in my experience nova and magma make up a great deal of my overall damage at 60 in dungeons. You also rely on nova and searing in questing and PvP.
---
Further I like the choices in resto. Tidal focus is the obvious choice, followed by totemic focus to make totems cheaper as you will be moving around a lot in dungeons and in the world. This also synergises with improved fire totems and call of flame for cheap on demand burst. Nova is cheaper than chain lightning at 60. 
---
Finally,  totemic mastery means you have to drop totems even less and it extends the range of them all by 10 including Tremor out to 40.
---
Tidal mastery brings your crit from talents to a whopping 11%. 
---
Natures swiftness can be used as a emergency nuke heal with healing wave or for that sweet lightning bolt/CL/lightning bolt/shock combo for crazy burst.
---
Whilst not optimal, if you are in complete bis, this build raid heals very well. Just drop windfury, SOE and fire resistance totem and chain heal rank 1 to victory. 
---
This spec PvPs like a demon as well. Effective nuker and healer all in one.
---
GL.
---
I love Chromie!
---
Oh thanks again dude
---
You just went full retail. Never go full retail
---
I am telling you. If there was no sharding and no cross realm dungeoning then retail would own. People like to shit on different features of retail but i feel like it wouldnt happen if there was no sharding.
---
Got it, need on everything, swap to ML and take all greys too.
---
Some of those vendor drops can sell for 1g+
---
Get all that drop in a run? Thats a smooth 15-20g!!
---
Worth more money than you can farm till level 60 feels bad and prices still rising
---
LMAO I didn't even notice that it recorded that.
---
Don't use immolate at all. It's not worth the cast time/mana for the low damage. Just cast CoA, corruption then drain life and on to the next target. Your damage will probably be higher with less breaks in between mobs.
---
I was mind-controlled this morning. It's not true.
---
Wasn't taking either side but lol I see what you did there.
---
IF is dead on my server too. I think it's because they left the AH in SW. Back in '04 WoW there was only one AH per faction, and the alliance one was in IF (and then the neutral AH in tanaris).
---
They are not even things that were changed. OP is a grade A Moron
---
My youre a tall one!
---
Yeah in 6 months from now.
---
Smells like butt!
---
Yes. If it doesn’t specify, it gives both.
---
You're really overblowing how many damage talents there are and while you're right that it's not a dedicated melee spec there is no denying it has a kit of melee talents that are very bad. 
---
The truth is the utility it gives you in combat is completely outshined by the other two specs, and the tools it gives you to deal with situations can not be backed up with the same damage as the other two specializations. You really don't get that much more crit and having one agility talent doesn't counter act how the other two trees have multiple damage focused talents while survival focuses on traps. Your last line is especially wrong. It sucks for leveling. It sucks in dungeons. Raids will not want you. It's okay in PvP. 
---
Play how you want, have fun experimenting, but don't give this guy hope that survival is some sort of secretly powerful spec that people just don't like. It's just not as good as the other two.
---
Yeah lemme pass these edgemasters to level 51 warrior without compensation :-)
---
Really made this screenshot what it is!
---
Meanwhile I tip 30s every time I get water no matter the rank.
---
Great, because we don't get enough antisemitism posted already.  Yes, I'm no fun.  Boo me.
---
Ret dps is generally lower than other classes but you can do so much more to help the group. 
---
Ret can give great buffs, can dps ok, can off tank, can emergency heal, then there are things like Divine intervention and blessings
---
If the healer or tank leaves you can take over (if you have a healing set, which you should)
---
Looks like Zaricotl was hungry. I'm happy to see people kiting things again, always fun when Teremus visits Stormwind. This is the first time I've seen Zaricotl in IF though lol
---
Sad thing is, shadow is pretty good outside if 40man raids.
---
Hunter pet which was abandoned I'd say
---
what
---
Try out the succubus, she deals a lot of damage and can also keep aggro while you apply dots. Not as good for hate fights but seems faster for killing mobs one by one.
---
&gt;Some people have five friends or guildies and don’t need to roll need in fear.
---
Other than the fact people have been ninjad by friends and guildies countless times. There's literally 0 reason to "ALL GREED" unless some one already hit the button before you established what to roll.
---
Just to be safe in the even some one didn't read chat or accidentally hits needs there's value in need being the default.
---
"Karma attempt" cute... like the up arrows have value to you or something
---
Paladins one of those classes that people love to hate for no real reason other than they’ve been told that they are a bad class. I’ve saved countless groups from wipes by just being able to bubble the healer when shit goes south, not to mention you bring very strong buffs to any group you go to.
---
No, Healing Wave is a different spell than Lesser Healing Wave.  It will only impact both if it says something more generic like healing spells, etc.
---
Lesser Healing Wave is designed to be your very quick bursty heal but for a questionable amount of Mana.  Emergency situations.   You should consider using a lesser ranked Healing Wave with spot healing for Mana efficiency and spell proccing and Lesser  Healing Wave only when you can afford it.

Nightblade, The crime solving blade.

Because it fucks with the economy, and because you agreed with Blizzard to not collude with other faction.

It's pretty funny.

Don't forget 8pm desolace todat

I'm reading it affects the price of the devilsaur set. Again  I don't see how that fucks up the entire economy.

Both of them, really.

This, I need to know.

Funny you say that considering that rogues are the ones that get the most use out of it, alongside druids.
---
You don’t cancel it after the first tick since you pop it to break an incoming CC. You /cancelaura it after you removed the CC. 
---
There’s an alliance-only quest item that can also cause self-damage.
---
I know :( I need more help to win this war!
---
Yeah, well, and no flying mounts... And no LFR... And no class homogenization... And no ridiculous power creep.... And, well, if it was basically just patch 1.12 again.
---
2nd and 3rd are nice, but you're missing the options option of "progression servers" a la how Everquest has handled it successfully for years, servers you can transfer to/from your normal classic servers when they first launch perhaps, that would climb up through the expansions at a fairly brisk pace toward modern to give people a chance to experience every era of the game.
---
Classic+ would be pretty amazing though.  Gib Emerald Dream!
---
You didn’t play vanilla did you?
---
sword spec doesn't care if it's a fast weapon or not. unlike poisons, which have a static damage proc so you want as many attacks as possible, sword spec just does the sword's attack again. so even though a slow sword will proc less, it will do proportionally more damage than a fast sword, so it evens out.
---
287 try me!
---
Those shp are fantastic.
---
Let's get a Lord kazzak to SW.
---
Definitely good for beginners.
---
The threat Magni and Mortimer pose to the Imperium is kinda questionable, but they could should absolutely goomba stomp little Robby, because they're swollen with the power of their patrons and they're both psykers to boot, and he's still a *mere* primarch, no enhancements or snorting lines of warp dust to speak of.
---
One escape from certain doom is thrilling, two are interesting, but once you hit three the blue paint wears off his breastplate and you can clearly see the phrases "psh, nothing personnel, kid" and "original character DONUT STEAL" engraved on his Mk 4 plot armor, thereby hugely reducing the potential excitement yield for even the most extreme smurfophiliacs.
---
I'm pretty sure we're going to see all of the primarchs that *can* come back make a return. Sanguinius, Horus, ~~Alpharius~~ Alpharius, Curze and Ferrus Manus are clear cut in their deaths, as are the two lost primarchs. My money is on a return for everyone else, eventually. Even Vulkan, who could conceivably have met a final end in his last appearance, it was never confirmed. Corax waded out into the warp in the emoest was possible, but his fate is also conveniently unknown.
---
Dorn was originally confirmed killed during the first black crusade, but it was later retconned such that only his hand was found, rather than his whole body. Because no trophies fashioned from the rest of his corpse/wargear ever surfaced within the traitor legions - despite how thoroughly picked apart poor Ferrus was - this leaves a large percentage of Lord Adornable unaccounted for.
---
Retail called.
---
It's a video game... I believe in you 💪
---
39 Ret Paladin was some of the most fun I've ever had in BG's.
---
Gearing up was also really exciting because there was a clear BiS list and once you had them all you became a God among men.
---
STV was my problem child as well.  It's fun doing the quest at 35 and having to creep and run like when you fish for chests.
---
All the warlocks that twisted?
---
Dungeon quests give tons of XP, doing every dungeon at least once is generally a good idea.
---
But you should absolutely plan for a single run to last 2+ hours. Especially lengthy instances like Waling Caverns (although you've already outleveled those - Blackfathom Deeps would be good though, and at level 30 Razorfen Kraul).
---
Can you not read the saltiness in between the lines? The man must be eating anchovies like a damn cat to be this salty.
---
I don't know what happened with people just moving their merry way if they don't like something.
---
i got a lucky ginn-su sword, boe level 36 blue at 1.7 speed. that's lasted me quite a long time.
---
That right there is horse shit. If you both roll the same you need to roll again. You got played son.
---
Is it worth selling fishes now or should I hold them a little?

---
Wasn't sure spec or faction or anything.  I was using the Duskwood spiders usually around the western flightpath (that big cemetery).  Lower drop rate but they were lower difficulty.
---
when i downloaded it like 2\~ weeks ago, it said it was in beta. so its not even close to being completed
---
Streaming is allowed ergo cross faction collusion is allowed
---
Never, some people will always want a "pure" experience. Are they not allowed to enjoy that?
---
That makes sense, thanks for letting me know man!
---
You WILL get destroyed by a mage and likely a priest or lock as MDPS.
---
I do recommend you roll on to 40 or so and see how you feel.
---
I leveled a warrior in the original Vanilla and it was brutal. You had to pull everything remotely multi-pack with your gun/bow and melee it hoping to god you didn’t aggro anything else.
---
Same with improved torment by all 3 points
---
There's also the guy who wants you to collect "snuff", which I believe to be swedish snus.
---
Download the Census Plus add-on. It'll give you a lot info for your server.
---
So honorable /s 
---
Happens to me all the time when I counter gank some warrior who charged me when I was low on hp fighting mobs. Somehow half the horde population jumps to his aids and treats me as if I was h*tler junior kicking a puppy
---
Damned alliance! Using chairs everywhere they go!
---
If the tank can't hold against healing agro on a normal sized pull, he's not doing it right
---
At least. Tanks can be pretty wary about joing a dungeon a few bosses in. Usually means the group has issues.
---
I think Messiah only shows up after Israel420 gets killed.
---
What's going down? I can't afford to sub atm ans my game time will die in an hour or so so I will miss it :(
---
Great screenshot. Name your cat.
---
Yo, 17 also and just did my first DM run which I was pretty excited about!
---
i have level 150 in two handed axes and swords, is this the max or is there a way to make it higher?
---
My server seems to be Horde dominated.  For what alliance there are, SW is the hot spot.  It's just easier to the favored starting zones, plus Dead Mines and Stockade, and closer to STV.
---
No, in vanilla it auto selected
---
As a Herod player, i'd also love a source, first i'm hearing about this.
---
My statement is correct. 
---
Without bok: 1 str = 2 ap

KABOOM
---
No one really has built up capital yet, if you don't need it immediately I'd wait a little bit until people have disposable income.
---
That would have been awesome
---
i tried tanking uldaman as a prot pally once, lost aggro so many times, in the end we got to the last dude and couldn't kill him because when he spawns the elite adds i can't grab and hold them fast enough
---
i can almost guarantee you that some warrior with a 2h axe could have done a better job just by spamming sunder armor and occasionally taunting
---
Idk about a website but you could get the Atlasloot addon, it shows you all the gear from dungeons,raids, professions, and reputations.

Pretty sure classic wowhead has a 3D model viewer, you can create a set to see how it will look.
---
Unless you are on a RP server, if you're really attached to looks, you won't last too long in classic lol
---
The game is from 2004 and even back then wasn’t that hard to run 
---
Idk how well it works on different systems doe
---
I went to Ironforge first time to be able to equip guns on my Warrior. I live pulling by shooting, and I even backtrack so I can shoot twice before initiating the whack-fest.
---
r/wowcirclejerk
---
Still easier for the tank to do it with a ranged weapon, as they'll have them all targeting him from the start.
---
he's jealous
---
I would assume yes... i would assume i‘d run on my phone aswell
---
i only immolate first if i know the mob will die to one round of dots because you can immolate into fear, slap CoA/corruption/siphon and forget about the mob and target another one
---
drain tank build all the way
---
Hahaha that's both sad and cool!
---
Are they also ganking around the pools or just buying up all the sub 10g recipes?
---
Small clarification.
---
The only one faction for a given player on a given server thing only applies to PvP servers.
---
But this kind of abuse couldn't happen on PvE servers anyway; and yes that restriction is in place to prevent this kind of abuse.
---
Phase 2 is gonna be awesome! That's when we get him and Azurgos right?
---
Blizzard told us people like that are lieing and don't have a bank full of materials, so he has to provide serious proof for us to think he actually has it.
---
Now I really want to get a bunch of hunters on mounts together and rp as the the mongols
---
My friends always have to wait on me, cause I'm a slow reader and the quests are so important for immersion.

If what you're after is getting immersed in the world, exploring, and having a great time, Classic will work well. If you want to get into raiding, you'll want to be sure you're focusing on one character rather than leveling up a ton of alts, and be ready for it to take some time to get to 60. Personally, I'm soaking up the ambiance and enjoying the world on the way up
---
Like clockwork...
---
I do 3 dots and wand and it holds aggro for 80% of mobs hp
---
Awwww rip basically the alliance wanted a rematch for what happened at the crossroads (I could dm you my twitch so you're able to see what happens later)
---
Yes, it won’t be the best but it will run.
---
Ask them to mark a skull, or hit the one with the most sunders. Some target switching is needed while tanking to hold against multishots/dots/cleaves.
---
I'm super casual, and fucking love it. I want to raid eventually, but life comes first, so it'll be a while before I am geared enough. Just do it and have fun.
---
WoW tends to attract a lot of inherently antisocial people so it's not too surprising that those behaviors extend into the game.
---
You will need the mod Weak Auras for this:

Looks like I was wrong, it's OOM at two mins, even with downranking and consumables.

It's really not

Is the game more demanding while in raid or pvp or in populated area?

also a rogue, i very rarely have to loot a second time when using my pickpocket opener macro.

I'm also new to the game. Been playing druid and having a blast. You can heal tank or dps. With leather working and skinning as professions, I've been able to make good gear for free. Not only that but if I play with people I usually make them something as a token of gratitude before splitting up. They're always really happy to get it and I don't mind. I'm only level 15 but it's about the people you meet along the way, be friendly and good things will happen to you.

Alt print screen isn't tied to a monitor.  It snap shots whatever window is currently active.

Raptor meat and eggs are great for leveling cooking from like 100ish to 200 so those will probably sell on the AH for a little bit too.
---
Currently on my server for about 7g. I’m a lock (39) so I’m not in desperate need of money, will waiting a month or so net me more gold?
---
I tried doing this quest today and it caused me to be stream sniped and corpse camped grieved by a scum horde guild.
---
They lived up to the quest lore.
---
In that case, check the damage range of the weapon. Weaponskillls (Sinister Strike, Backstab, Hemo) do damage range + normalized attack power (I believe it's like 1.8 for daggers and 2.6 for swords?). So a faster weapon with the same damage range as a lower level slow one is always better. A fast weapon with lower damage range... there's a bit more math involved.
---
Eh. Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge is near BiS and it's 2.8 speed.

There being only one AH was in alpha or beta. Live had both I thought, or were they added late into vanilla?

Bfa is unappealing and boring. No point in playing retail.

7g atm, will it increase when pvp and alts are eventually a focus?
---
I don't expect to be paid if I randomly open trade and drop it in. If I initiate it, it's a gift. That said, I've occasionally had a player tip me a few silver (once, someone tipped 20s!) for water. I think I'd given them three stacks? So I put two more in there when I saw what they were tipping lmfao.
---
If someone asks me for water, if I'm not doing anything and it's a lower leveled water I can make in a few casts, it's free. Higher leveled water's gonna cost 'em, though. It takes forever to make.

Send him some mana pots. If he's as good as you say he'll have many uses for them.   A feral druids rampage only ends when he's oom.

Can't see the report.  Does it include playtime?  One person can represent ten in terms of real world activity depending on play times.  Server population numbers assume a relative average playtime distribution, I imagine anyway. No clue if that's a good assumption or not.
---
Yep. Particularly given the level differential. Very little chance of poly resist.
---
Same
---
Nice repost, very cool
---
How has this been posted so many times in such a short amount of time?

It's more mana intensive to heal non tanks, though. Doable, but not necessarily fun.

Sorta related, for a while I had a macro so that when I cast chain lightening I'd also yell "Unlimited Powweeer!". Such a satisfying spell.

You can find some bows/crossbows/guns with really good stats on them, which makes them better as ranged damage doesn’t matter as a rogue.

Can't see the MotW on enemy players, but if you're an experienced player you can make an educated guess on their level based on what they're wearing too.

Isn't it wonderful, I love being in populated areas in MMO's, old SWG, City of Heroes, GW1/2, SWTOR, etc.  Fairbanks is extremely crowded in cities in the evenings, and Barrens chat scrolls pretty fast.
---
Least he's too busy trying to find food in his bags for Misha to attack outright.
---
Yeah, all BOE blue/purple are equal rolls. No priority given to anyone. The simple fact of the matter is that the item represents an upgrade to basically every piece of your gear.
---
It represents an improvement on basically all of that mage's gear, or the Hunter's gear, or Druid etc. 
---
So in a very real sense "need if improvement" applies to every class.
---
How is it less aggro?
---
The classic client is actually based off Legion 7.3.5, so it’s actually a fair bit more modern than the original vanilla client.
---
This was one of the obscure pieces of knowledge I still had from 15 years ago.
---
Cant even remember my password for the photocopier I use everyday but those weapon masters...
---
(Also the muscle memory from generation 1 pokemon for getting through rock tunnel without flash.)
---
Edgy players. Always in every game lol.
---
Not familiar with them but I can imagine.
---
I've only used them a bit, but they were great. I have fostex t-50s as my main cans. If I didn't get the fostex I would have the Phillips all day.
---
&gt; If there was no sharding and no cross realm dungeoning then retail would own.
---
Ahem...
---
You'd still instantly que for a dungeon, complete it, and forget who you were running with instantly because it's so easy to replace everyone.  The easier it is to make a group, the less anyone will bother to make friends.
---
The quests would still be all 100% soloable.  That means no need to give/receive buffs with strangers.  No need to stop and help someone.
---
The "Hit the mob and get quest credit" system makes it so that you don't have to group for kill quests, just show up and friendly NPCs (aka Retail players who you don't know) will help you complete it without talking to them or grouping with them.
---
That instant que and teleport to dungeon means that most tanks and healers won't need to leave the city to efficiently dungeon level.  And every single dungeon quest is available at the entrance, so even the committed dungeoneers (like myself) wouldn't have to go out to do pre-dungeon prep quests to make the most of it.
---
Professions would still be worthless till endgame, so no one would be out in the world leveling professions and running into each other.  So no higher-level characters running into you and helping you out (though as we discussed above, you will never need help in Retail anyway).
---
Flying would still kill world PvP since you can just zip around the sky to avoid combat.  Though retail already killed world PvP with its warmode system anyway.
---
And then the worst offender of them all: LFR.  If you thought it was fun to work hard to progress in the storyline of a game, LFR makes that a thing of the past.  Don't talk to anyone, just press the button to join.  Don't even have to play your class, just get carried through the 'fight cutscene' and see the big bad of the expansion fall to your complete lack of effort.  What a profoundly unsatisfying way to tell a story.  And it kills the need to build a community among people who want to see the storyline too.
---
lmaoooooo u dick /s
---
&gt;How do I change my demons name
---
hard disagree.  not every area is like pirates in tanaris.
---
Right, but that doesn't require a macro unless you're doing some fancy mouseover stuff.
---
I always get into dungeons as a rogue.
---
It's the best 2H weapon at that level, so you will see competition.
---
A close friend of mine did. I almost hit that point, too.
---
I think the tedium is a valid criticism.
---
well..th-the horde are p-playing more... jesus christ let it go
---
I’m really sorry you have to deal with the Ayatollah and all the sanctions pushed by my country. Your post was really well thought out and I hope it becomes popular enough for some suits at Blizzard to see.
---
"Figure I been at it for a good 15 years now.
---
I reckon people are driven to do what they do for different reasons.
---
Now, I'm not saying you need to play for 15 years or roll every item in the world to become a master raider. I reckon you just need to be determined - determined enough to sit on your duff for hours at a time, doin' nothin' while you fly or wait for people to drink for mana."
---
ITT: people who use VW wrong
---
Oh, thanks!
---
This is more than fair. Especially at higher levels, the water and food can cost quite a bit of time to make. It's not worth vendor price because it disappears when you log out for too long, but on the plus side, if you end up logging out before you've used up what you got, you can just trade it (without loss) to someone else who will appreciate it. :D
---
Throwing is very nice while leveling because they are fast for pulling.
---
Ez 2/3 of someone's healthbar right there, you'd be stupid not to.
---
Couldn't agree more. Playing a hybrid is great fun and is personally rewarding. It's just a shame that others don't see that and just pass on you because sub-optimal dps.
---
Thank you! I will try it out and let you know!
---
Yaaaas. That shit is RIFE WITH POWER.
---
You should never stomp on waffles.
---
Then when the healer goes oom from healing 4 people each tanking their own mob instead of 1 and one of those dps dies, let's blame that healer.
---
Are you high? Im loving the experience, I just have a really hard time settling on one class
---
I definitely remember Stampi in TB being in vanilla, but I cant remember if they added him in a later patch.
---
Ofc but it's from 2005
---
Especially that last line. Mmmmm
---
It seems obvious now, but I didn't really notice how retail just doesn't feel like an MMO at all. There are so many systems to let you skip everything that makes the game feel like a world; flying mounts, dungeon finder/LFR, porting you into instances where you don't speak and don't need to speak to any other players, every class works on their own and doesn't have any real decision/choice/class flavour to assist other classes (eg. choosing a specific totem or warlock curse to help your party), all the quests are linear and have a "You are the **one** true champion who saves/saved Azeroth" mentality.
---
And you just don't need to *do* anything to make your life easier. You rarely need to use the bank any more, you don't need to venture around the world to find your class trainers or whatever.
---
People don't realize how time-consuming making water can be. I mean, if I'm doing literally nothing else, it's not so bad to sit and regen mana, but if I'm trying to get stacks ready, it takes forever. I'm usually at an instance making extra stacks to give to other players well before the group finishes forming, because I like giving everyone 3 stacks who can use it.
---
Yup, you can quest and do normal grinding stuff. You'll probably struggle on high pop servers in major cities; as well as raids and PvP. But you can definitely play.
---
There is a fairy tail in every realm, but this doesn't seem to be our realm's fairy tail.
---
This is some seriously high quality content! Appreciate the effort. Kind of nice to get some background as we re-explore vanilla!
---
One instance of you being mind controlled doesn't make a bug non-existent. Why is that hard for the 100's of people in this thread. Bugs are dysfunctioning code, it can require a hundred variables to happen.
---
Except when you still out-damage the taunt
---
Uhmm all classes regen mana while not spell casting, even in combat.
---
Well.. except classes with no mana bar.
---
OP said "in a dungeon"
---
Not buddies anymore
---
Anyone tried taming King Bangalesh in STV? He doesn’t seem to have the “cobra reflexes”. Is this intentional? 
---
Also can Enrage from pets trigger off of skills like claw/bite? Or only autos? Thanks
---
IMO 20-30 is the roughest cause there’s no really good weapon,  if you can keep going for 3 levels and then get someone to help you with WW axe you will be set!
---
Its getting darker, believe me
---
It doesn't scan who has the addons it scans the whole world using /who.
---
A lot of free time? How so? I'm not talking about the try-hards that are already level 60.... I'm talking about the average players, that are probably still in their 30's
---
Supposedly yes.
---
Doesn't it hit a diminishing return after a certain amount of +attack power? I've seen it happen as I have a +20 attack power staff and damage barely goes up anymore after getting benefits from a strength of earth totem.
---
There was an urban legend in vanilla that your pet grew very slightly after each level up.
---
Nah. I said in general. If you don't think there is any bit of truth to what I'm saying that's fine. There is though.
---
**somechanges**
---
Dang man I'm sorry to hear that. It's never too late to re-roll on a different server
---
I'm leveling as arcane mage. Leveling is the best time to get away with a suboptimal spec. I figure I'm going to be shoehorned into frost for the next year, and fire for a year after that. I might as well mix it up while I can.
---
Arcane Missile/Frostbolt rotation is also underrated for leveling speed.
---
Whatever pace you take, the only limit to reaching sixty is the amount of time you have to sink in.
---
It’s only a testament to the fact the player had the 260 hours or whatever necessary.
---
Go home you are drunk
---
Yikes... Is this common on Alli side?
---
Lots of time to do it while travelling.
---
Rock paper scissors is not pure chance and does involve skill. Reading your opponent and predicting their play is a learnable skill.
---
I doubt there is any consistent to this. I've been healing as dungeons all classic and there is no way in hell I'll ever be able to get spirit tap up with any consistent by wanding a mob before it dies. Maybe a couple of times, but not enough to be able to rely on consistently to gain mana throughout an instance...
---
That was the only wise decision left, I approve.
---
Mage: 2 consecutive crits =  Free Pyroblast.
---
Ah true. Man it has been a while lmao
---
That's how many of us feel.
---
Exactly in the end it's just pixels. Thats why you show courtesy and greed. The chances it gets ninjalooted are low. And even then actions can be taken. Make sure to always take screenshots if it happens. And show the whole story. Best way is to take it up with the person itself. In a adult manner. If thats not resulting in anything positive talk with his GM. No result. Warn other players about him. I think in chat is against ToS. But on official discord it isn't. But in the end just ignore him.
---
Or running up to a mage right before he frost nova/arcane explosion/blizzard
---
Stocks are so easy when you have a Warlock in your party. They just Curse of Recklessness to prevent the running and you never have to worry about that. Without a warlock though... Bad stuff happens.
---
He could be telling the truth. Hand of Justice drops off Angerforge right now (supposed to drop off Emperor Thaurissan
---
boo
---
VW is worthless and those talents would be a waste even if they made it's agro holding not worthless because drain tanking is just faster and imo more fun. 
---
The imp is fine to use, but if you're on a pvp server I have to recommend using the succubus. Having that out has saved me from being ganked multiple times. You can seduce and bandage up and even things out if they try and initiate when you've life tapped between mobs. Then all of the sudden you're at good health and get the first shot on them rather than them getting the easy gank they expected. 
---
 And against human mobs it's a great safety net for group pulls that's less risky than fear. Honestly even on a PvE server I'd recommend succubus but I have a great time with the imp too so I understand when people prefer that. At level 38 I think you get a new blood pact and new fireball rank so I'll probably use him again then until succubus's lash of pain ranks up after that.
---
Yes he did, however it just seemed appropriate, but good spot.
---
That sounds like a good idea! Thanks
---
Yea lol at some point its just called botting
---
I like how the bird plays the jump animation too
---
probsbly the first time that pallys has won any pvp lol

Yes, but that's not the right meaning. Percolation is what happens in those big old school coffee makers lol.
---
omg lol

Clearly.
---
Damn u salty
---
No like the posts together was already posted
---
I'd rather there be a time sink than an option for people to skip that time sink by paying money. That's how you ruin end game experiences for everyone that actually invested the time.
---
Awesome!

when you're traveling by foot: fight everything on the way. No time

it's well known on my server that if you see more than 2 ally and you're alone you better run. they only attack in groups
---
That's literally the same as how OG in retail is lol.
---
For Hunter
---
Level 10 you get access to pets
---
Level 20 you get aspect of cheetah
---
Level 40 you get bestial wrath from the bm talent tree, ideally
---
Those are the big moments
---
I use renew immediately after a big heal has been cast on the tank and then switch back to wand spam. Being instant cast it has a minimal impact on regen and also delays the cast of my next bigger heal. Other than that just running between pulls when mana isn't an issue.
---
I have no idea what any of this means lol this is that wow talk.
---
That sounds like actual hell.
---
Can you imagine if wow looked like this? Dope af.
---
In the early part of raiding (like, not the 100th time you run MC), combat rogues will generally be top DPS because they only need to win a roll on one good MH and will get a good OH easily.  Later, when fury warriors gear, they will be competitive.  But mages and warlocks can very high too.  Rogue and warlocks require more precision around button mashing though.
---
None of them are so far apart that it matters really, *at all*.
---
Guilds that think they need some very precise amount of each class just don't know anything more than something they read or saw in a video.  You can even do a full MC clear with a handful of wonky spec'ed people in a full raid so long as they aren't dying early.  People make an enormous deal over DPS, but what matters is damage.  Your DPS doesn't matter if you consistently die halfway into a fight.
---
Just play what you find fun and enjoyable.
---
alright, I installed weak auras and I imported this into a new display amd a sword specialist helper popped up, now I just test how it works, thank you.
---
Blizz never said that. They said it wasn't as bad as some of the rumors going around.  That's obviously specific wording that admits it was happening, just not to the point of people getting 3000 arcane crystals in a single day.
---
People here who have some weird need to defend layering against any criticism seemed to think this meant "no exploiting happening" and repeated it a lot.  No where did blizz ever *ever* say layers weren't being exploited in this fashion.
---
the economy wont fully form for at least another month. people are just now starting to actually be able to gold farm more. id say we will hit a plateau and the economy will even out in about 3 months from now. its what happened in old school runescape, and im sure it will repeat itself again.
---
Note: I have since created a /thanks macro I can just hit every time I am buffed. Super easy and adds to the immersion of the game.
---
As a hunter (21), how many pets can I have on me and in my stable? I thought I read at 18 I can have 5 pets at a time but when I dismiss my current pet and try to tame another it says I have too many pets already.
---
What’s that?
---
Okay. I'm going to be that guy and just say it. Downvote away.
---
When you were logged into BfA and were hanging around in Boralus or Zulduzar, where there is just as many people if not MORE in those cities at once. Un-sharded. Did you feel that way then? What makes *this* feel like an MMO but not retail?
---
I really don't get posts like this. Yeah it's great the cities are filled but it's exactly the same on retail. Anyone who says otherwise needs to get off their dead server or stop lying.
---
Maybe this is a dumb question, but best weapons for priest? I'm using mace and off hand item and a wand. Feel like this is right but just want to make sure. Also, what stats should I be going for? I'm mostly aiming for int.
---
Finally, I'm mostly solo questing with the occasional dungeon since they are easy to get into as a healer. But, I'm speccing shadow since i read it was easier to level, especially solo. Is this correct or should I respec?
---
Feels good.
---
I read that they gave him a deaggro mechanic
---
I like the one on the frontpage more :) I don’t quite get this one
---
I've for a 4 stack of friends that play together. I'm the warrior/tank. When we need a 5th, a druid is what I want beside me. That guy is an idiot

Faster than imp one by one?
---
If your Agony actually expires your kill time is awfully low.
---
Maybe had a mount. (40) or travel form (30)
---
I'm lvl 54 and still don't have shoulderpads
---
Well, technically you are kidnapping some demons and enslave them to do some work to you...so i think that the demons have a previous name.
---
Don't see how this is in any way consistent when you have dps in a dungeon run destroying mobs. Wand is slow and there's no way you could time one to get a finishing blow unless your group is simply letting mobs run away without attacking them. 
---
And mind blast? You're going to tell me that the mana you gain back from spirit tap while casting heals in a dungeon setting gives back more mana than the mana spent on mind blast hoping to get a killing blow throughout an instance? I just don't see this being viable.
---
U needed that many people to kill it? Huehue
---
Classic + (safe version)
---
Multispec - 1st=100g 2nd =1000g
---
Unfinished Zones/Raids = Hyjal/Uldum Azshara maybe a few more over time.
---
Maybe add 2-3 more tiers after Naxx (T4-T6 gear)
---
Anything more then this would be unsafe imo.
---
Hell no. Idgaf about BFA
---
I refuse to name my pet and get attached to it until I get Broken Tooth, otherwise I'll have trouble giving him up :\[

Yeah... exactly. The only areas are dungeons, and sometimes you are too low for them so you're shit outta luck.
---
I ask for spare mageweave for my waters :/
---
This is actually better than wasting valuable mouse buttons slots.. thanks for the tip!
---
There is something to be said for questing without an addon.  I did it all those years ago without one and it really made me learn the world.   Despite it being nearly 10 years since the last time I did most of these quests, i still remeber where nearly all of the ones I have done so far were from back then.
---
can you do that in classic? how?
---
I fucking hate when people bring up Bob the Builder in classic, too ^/s
---
Why? Isn't it just as good to seduce a rogue opener?
---
Oof that 99 roll guy just have been pissed.
---
I just got my nightsaber mount last night, and now I'm sitting at work practically falling asleep because I refused to wait any longer to get it. I can say that it was totally worth it though haha. Good luck on your goal.
---
For me its just the fact that I‘m rly bad at pvp. Tried to kill a lvl 17 priest as a lvl 20 mage. Got demolished by his wand. Now I just keep running away from every hordy I face
---
Green quests do give the same amount of xp and should he 100% be doing those
---
Weapons are just stat sticks.  Go for spirit&gt;int/stam.  Wands are most important for DPS so make sure you update them when you can.  Pre-40 disc + spirit tap.  40+ shadow and depending on how you level you may wanna finish off (55+)with disc if you are going to be grouped a bunch for attunements/pre-raid gear.
---
Just bind auto run to the tilde key...
---
I'm not an expert but Succubus has been my personal favorite leveling pet since like mid 30s
---
I like to use tenkeyless keyboards so that the keyboard and mouse can be closer together. No numlock for me.
---
Plus, even when I do have numlock it bugs me that autorun toggles the numlock. I usually map it to something more convenient, like an extra button on my mouse.

One pet on you, one pet in stable. You can spend 5g later to have two in the stable.

She might hold aggro as well as big blue, but she still doesn't hold aggro at all.
---
I run dark pact with none of her abilities on auto cast, and she cannot hold aggro ever.

You can only have one pet on you at a time, regardless of level. If you want to tame a new pet, you will either have to put your current active pet in the stable or release it.
---
You do realise the whole way reddit works is that people vote on what they find interesting? If people dont like it, you wont see it.
---
Instead of using vw, you use succ or fh. And drain life to keep yourself full. It's a lot faster and generally more effective if you're grinding the right way
---
Like 20 times and there's even more after this one.
---
I think there was an AH in every city but they weren't connected, so the main AH was in Orgrimmar and whatever is the main city of alliance.
---
Against a marksman focused build, the really important things your miss are the +5% damage and the trueshot aura, in exchange of 3% crit and 15% agility. Sure, the first is better, but it's not like you trade it for complete shit. Bonus crit and agility IS very useful.
---
&gt; It sucks for leveling 
---
Leveling is a breeze as a hunter, whatever your spec is (even without spec), and the tree offer good things. 
---
&gt;  It sucks in dungeons 
---
Any group composition of tank/heal/3dps with everyone having a IQ &gt; 90 will clean the dungeons. Being survival instead of beast or marksman won't transform a sure clean in a total wype, and the difference won't be noticeable.
---
&gt; Raids will not want you

Raids need 40 peoples and many here seems to forget how fucking hard it's to get 40 peoples to do  the same shit for hours, and today, groups of random pugs with green quest stuff and memespec are cleaning raids. If we had to believe redditors, it's impossible to find a place in a raid if you aren't warrior/mage/priest which is a complete joke. A hunter survival is still one damage dealer. Sure, if they have to choose between the survival and a marksman with trueshot aura, they will take the latter. 
---
But as again, it's a group of 40 peoples, when you are building it, there is no reason to not take another hunter. 
---
I had little difficulty to find a place in raid.
---
 At worst, you can already find a niche as a nightfall user (which people LOVE) if you REALLY had to convince a raid leader convinced that he will need the perfect composition to clean the raid.
---
&gt; It's okay in PvP 
---
To be fair here, hunter is already good in pvp, survival is just more situationnal than the others.
---
I roll on Herod, haven't seen a queue in several days, probably even a week. I'm not logging in at 0600, I'm logging in at 1500 PST, which is 1800 EST and should be the peak time for an East coast server. I've logged in at nearly every hour the past week (I only work part time, and my uni doesn't start for another week, so I've got lots of freetime).
---
All this, because we offered server transfers off Herod to "dead servers." I hope these new servers thrive, and we shouldn't be so negative as to call them dead in the water.
---
I'm with you, I've been loving it. On Kromcrush, even UC has been popping during peak hours.
---
It's just at wow-pro.com.
---
The base add-on for classic had James guide from 30 on. The guisdes for alliance from 1-30 are not the best though, and they're not made by James. Definitely takes off after 30.
---
This is the third time this has been posted
---
They can think about what they've done on the run back
---
For warriors yeah. For most classes it’s only 1. For rogues agility is way better than strength since they give the same AP.
---
*Shamaritan
---
Not everything should be worked with "money", sometimes you can work out things with words. In this case a please and thank you should be enough
---
You poor soul :/
---
This isn't actually true though. No one has pulled this crap in any of the dungeons ive puged. If you pull this on me without running it by the group first, then I hope you spent your money on potions because I'm never healing you again.
---
i do that since then i dont need wool and such for my sharpening stone
---
I am sitting next to Nat Pagle fishing right now, just waiting until I hit 225 so I can start this quest.
---
I'm starting to think you don't know what "byproduct" means..
---
Wait really?
---
I didn't think any information was officially released for anything past phase 1¿
---
Sadly not supported. =(
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Yeah like I said I started out like that. but when I spent 45 minutes just finding princess in elwynn forest... I just don't have that kind of time. I still read quests and I end up exploring lots. Plus this is my first ever go at the game. I get immersed AF and lose track of time easily lol
---
Updated character models is fine if they give the player a toggle button. I dont need a hairdresser though.
---
Isn't Cobra Reflexes TBC?
---
Hunters are also very good in MC.
---
The average mage it's not level 2...
---
ha!
---
It goes to the computer
---
Unless you're interrupting an important ability, don't stun mobs that would otherwise attack the tank. Spell damaging abilities give a ton of rage and you're fucking with the threat tables by opening with a stun.
---
Either use a dagger swap macro for the ambush or just garrote.
---
Feral uses mana?
---
The level 20 quest for the succubus has you find 2 "pure hearted" men, kill them, and use their hearts as bait to summon a demon.
---
Why is STV called STVietnam?
---
Oh yeah. Throw it in your back unless you need the G for your mount. People have always twinked to just feel like they’re better players. It’s inevitable it’ll happen. You just may have to wait a bit but it could easily double/triple down the line
---
Wasn’t hair dresser added in TBC? If so I think it’s likely to make it in when they add that content
---
I love that book!
---
You can take the boat at Booty Bay to get to the barrens or the boat at Menethil to get to Darkshore. Darkshore should have quests around your level. :)
---
Hi, /u/thomaswrocks

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d45xq4/anyone_know_how_to_check_ah_ratio_on_a_server/). 
---
What level are you? Once she has seduction she's totally different. At level 48 now I 100% prefer her to any other pets while questing
---
They already have an option to use the updated graphics. Or are you talking about the upgraded models?
---
I can attest to this, as a 42 druid, mana pots are huge
---
It’s very DAE ELI5 EMOJIPOLICE WOOOOOWOOOOOOO FFFUUUUUUUUU 42069 REDDITORS WHEN DOES THE NARWHAL CABON???! LELELE
---
Yeah, I didn't mention hunters.  And hunters became excellent in BC.
---
Depends. I have a second account where I level an alt during downtime or travel on my main. I can feed gold, bags, and run it through dungeons..
---
On that same second account you could go to a lower population server while you wait in queue on main.
---
Why is this reposted constantly? It's just a roll on an item....
---
same tbh i have questions about what talents to pick in feral
---
Haha this is amazing. I love it
---
I realise now afterwards that if I just had taken out the mobs one at a time I'd probably been fine.
---
&gt;You'd still instantly que for a dungeon, complete it, and forget who you were running with instantly because it's so easy to replace everyone.  The easier it is to make a group, the less anyone will bother to make friends.
---
Thats not how it was before LFG was cross realm. Tanks would get instant queues but no one else did. And if you liked the group you would add people to reduce your queue times and hopefully get help with world quest since these people were around your level and played the same time you did.
---
Thanks fam!!!!
---
They're very comfortable and have held up quite well.
---
At first I was unsure about the open backs, but it's really good for directional sounds and they're not obnoxiously loud to anyone else in the room.
---
Succ has 2 attacks, imp just bolts a few times and then waits for mana
---
This probably never happened in 15 years of WoW ...
---
&gt; all the quests are linear
---
How awesome would branching quests be in Classic?
---
"Bring me 10 troll hides"
---
"No, 8."
---
"Okay 8."
---
Yes. I mean models. Sorry
---
It was a joke mr salt man.
---
Wolfshead helm is lvl 40 crafted blue and it's a druid's BIS until the end of the game.
---
/moo
---
Why not just petition blizzard to make retail more like classic instead of trying to change classic into retail?
---
Quarter second each time you want to auto run. It adds up.
---
Guys. I’m so, so torn. I simply do NOT know what to play. I want to level something so badly. I don’t know what I prefer - I guess that’s a side effect of PD.
---
I love Horde, but friends play Alliance thus so will I.
---
The hell do I play?! First comment to reply is the class I’ll get to 60. Thank you so, so much.
---
Auctioneer is working just fine.
---
If you're trying to use one from private servers it won't work because Private servers are on 1.12.2, where as Classic is 1.13.2, 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctioneer/files/2774013
---
 Impressive scenario but not impressive kill. The hunter was coming off another battle while you played tag with the rogue
---
Or just use the search function before reposting bullshit. It's really not that difficult. Alternatively you could also ya know just keep your bullshit to yourself lol.
---
not a retail thing, I've been using them since vanilla and its very useful
---
Auctioneer is I guess only working for Retail WoW, idk if they’ll make a classic version? But I have also been on the search for an auction house add-on as well. Just something that maybe checks AH value of items? Idk if that even exists haha
---
Was underworld band for our group (130g) on Ah. We all needed and one lucky son of a gun won that wasn't me PepeSad
---
Succubus does more DPS than the imp so generally yeah. Succubus also doesn't really run out of mana unlike the imp so its more consistent aswell.
---
Oh, the Samsung remote. Best remote i ever had and cant stand my new sony piece of shit, clunky, useless remote. I miss the easy times :(
---
Don’t really use voids for lvling purposes, but always have it out for pvp purposes.  Not sure who you’re playing with but if you get imp void and stay up to date with the voids talents they do a fine job tanking. Thee dots and two shadow bolts is what it takes for me(lvl 47) to pull aggro off, or three dots and wand to death will rarely pull aggro.
---
In the screenshot the guy even said all greed before people rolled.  Blows my mind
---
the succubus is the best pet to level with. dont even wait till 40 dude the vw is complete and utter trash. pls use the succ lol. I still have lash of pain enabled on auto when i use her b/c it does a good amount of dmg imo. Dark pact is nice but it doesnt give you a crazy amount of mana. Seriously though use the succubus its amazing. I can kill elites 4 levels higher than me by just using succ dotting the target and drain lifing. sometimes i have to kite/death coil/fear but its amazing to lvl with. send your vw to the nether forever. the only thing a vw is good for is the sacrifice shield.
---
Am thinking about classic + path not with expansions :)
---
It is horde I guess? Because in alliance I remember there is story of 2 lovers where u gotta find heartwood
---
YOUR SUBMISSION HAS BEEN REMOVED DUE TO BEING A LOW EFFORT MEME.
---
Ive killed many people in darkshire with stitches using serpent sting and feign death so I can confirm
---
Wow, my character name was haddock in vanilla. Crazy.
---
I keep running into an issue where I run out of quests in a zone and waste so much time running around the zone doing 1 or 2 (ashenvale was a huge culprit). Am I supposed to bounce between zones often?
---
i swear, the SM lib boss only cares about making me a sheep.
---
Probably could have bought a phone with a better camera with the gold...
---
I can't believe nobody tried to Need it. Wow. Was it a guild group?
---
What's the problem
---
These are your options:
---
- Quest with friends
---
- Reroll PvE
---
- Play at off hours
---
- Dungeon grind
---
Unfortunately it looks like most PvP servers are heavy on the Horde side.
---
This happens if you're moving when you pp. If you're standing still, the auto loot should grab it
---
Large fries chocolate shake!
---
I'm sorry to hear you think that man. I rarely even get on reddit. Sometimes, I check some tech related information for work if I'm researching and get on the wowclassic forum to see funny meme's. I had like 50 karma points before this post even began. I expected 10 people to understand how crazy my story was and the probability of it happening was so damn low. It sounded even more crazy to me and I was there. 
---
But I do get it. It is hard to believe. I did find out why Coachbob remembered our real life names. Wafflesncoke and I used to live together back in wrath. We were college students at the time meaning....we played WoW for a living lol. Coachbob had both of our phone numbers to make sure we made it to raid. You know how those all night benders used to go back in the day? Play for like 10 hours straight, look and feel gross, and finally fall asleep on the floor with a tshirt you randomly found as a blanket....#college life.
---
Hey fishermen, any decent addons like fishing buddy make it to classic yet, checked a couple weeks ago, not sure if something has come out under the radar
---
Come join me in AV friend when the time comes. That's where the real fun be at!
---
Take it from somebody who has been trying to find AoE farming groups for the various levels of scarlet monastery, it is a MINORITY of players who play like that. It takes me at least 20 mins to find a fill group that's willing to run SM multiple times for hours.
---
Shift+spacebar. Thank me later.
---
What's a friend? :(
---
I can if for 3 alliance players there are 7 in horde everywhere I go. What's the point to even choose alliance if I am being griefed all the time
---
There is definitely a big opportunity for Blizzard to add certain much needed features to Classic.  The important thing is that they take things slowly and add them based on community feedback.
---
I took both for now. I'll power level a crafting skill with the profits once I hit 60.
---
How do you move the player UI ? I am unable to even when I unlocked it
---
Welcome to the Alliance
---
Do not buy gear from the AH, ever. Save your money so you can get a mount at 40.
---
he is! how did you figure?
---
You use macros for that.
---
You have been
---
All these drops are way undervalued atm, even low level blues. 
---
If you need the money for mount money prob worth it selling now, but Ive just been holding on to any boe blues till theres enough 60s to make a stable economy.
---
The power of the internet...

---
Like 21 gold. I had 1 gold leftover lol.
---
Serious doubts about how accurately this reflects total pops, though the faction balances are probably fairly accurate. For example, there's only a recorded 66k characters on Herod but my friends are telling me there's been small queues even recently still. I play on Westfall and I've never seen a queue, but there's 85k characters recorded.
---
I'm not saying that's false information, but it's clearly not representative of active unique players. It could be for a variety of reasons - insufficient data samples on Herod, people making more alts on Westfall for banking, people randomly logging into Westfall briefly when their main servers got queued but not sticking around, etc.
---
Just be very, very mindful if you intend to make judgements about servers based on the raw population numbers.
---
Wahhhhhh pvp
---
It's old news, buddy. They took the soul out of the game but I guess it didn't work out the way the wanted. Now they're stuck with a dead piece of shit of a game and a reboot of a 15-year-old masterpiece made by far greater game designers, who currently don't work at Blizz anymore sadly (at least most of them).
---
Every  loot is hunter loot!
---
Yeah, how date others have fun not doing what I like!
---
Big orc and tauren smash and stomp tiny gnome.
---
Absolutely fuck him lmao.
---
I care a lot more about getting a roll for 1k gold than I do someone who is dumb af wanting to equip a boe epic.
---
Sorry, yes, this is what it was.
---
Remote Desktop.
---
honor isn't in till phase two
---
Yday in STV it felt like 10 ally per 1 horde on razorgore
---
You would Never waste 3 points in improved thunderclap
---
And that is a thing that comes with the gig. He wanted $$$, so he streamed his run. He could have upload VoDs, he could have setup lengthy delay or he could have not been streaming at all. Do you think that he was the only person on the whole server that was ganked/had his leveling experience interrupted by other faction? No excuses.
---
This is pretty awesome! Keep it up guys!
---
"But only from trolls on the other side of the continent. Yea, that's right. Get walking peasant."
---
Intellect doesn't give spellpower in Classic. The +dmg/heal was renamed to spellpower in TBC iirc.
---
Oh, look, another purist who didn't actually play vanilla and thus doesn't know that addons like this existed back then and were quite popular.
---
You will be.
---
For optimal leveling, yes.
---
Fair enough, thank you for your honesty! And good luck finding a group for what you wanna play.
---
Screen shot of the day!
---
kinda looking for this info as well!
---
also found macro 3. and it also bugs sometimes for me as well!
---
Why didn't you need it?
---
Yes it is
---
What’s the P part mean?
---
Intellect grants no spell power.
---
That's what I thought, you don't know.  Good luck proving your point.

For questing, does every race get their own "quest series" to end game or do all races eventually end up merging into doing a main story line?
---
Damn straight.  Reminds me: I need to find those old Alamo guides/videos
---
He needed and that was the only thing I could figure is wrong with the picture
---
Isn’t it technically still 1:2 you just have more strength?
---
I hope one of my boys sees it! They are all stalking this subreddit, but no clue if they sort by new.
---
Alright awesome, thank you! I’ll look into getting this as an alternative.

What Did u Farm? How many do you need? I wanna do this too when im 60!

That hit me

---
I just straight up disagree. I completely understand why you think you should need, just disagree with your entire thought process. There’s a reason it’s called greed. Cheers
---
Especially the multi player bit, I haven't grouped with random people like this in like 10 years.
---
There are multiple ways of playing on a PVP server - imagine that. I’ve got nothing against you “Red is Dead” folks - but stop demanding other people play the same way.
---
Reroll.
---
this game is and always will be my alternative life and i dont like raiding. i pvp.
---
I've played since vanilla and I can't remember a time when everyone didn't all need on a valuable BoE, it's more new a recent toe that people would even consider passing on a BoE
---
suitable for level 30s but has no quests at that level? how does that make sense. it's also wrong because most mobs there are like 34-37
---
Horde has majority on most servers.
---
for years all i heard from people was "yeah pve is easy now, but back in vanilla it was super hard. like it really too skill. no man you have no idea, you wernt there"
---
skip ahead to now, and most of the groups clearing MC are like 1 streamer and 39 randoms who had never played vanilla before.
---
if an effective pug is able too clear MC then anyone can assuming they can get the group.
---
getting a group thats willing to actually play the game, aka listen to the call (or read) is difficult. the bosses are not.
---
when the rest of the playerbase hits 60 they will struggle, not because its difficult but because they'll sit there playing with the reaction time of a dead gerbil.

You shouldn't be that's hilarious
---
 Hey guys, I'm very new to classic. It's the stigma that you wont be able to play enhancement, it's not viable and that you'll be forced to run Healer. I don't want to be a hardcore raider but I wouldn't mind PvEing as Enhancement?
---
My question; Is Enhancement playable at all in PvE and PvP?
---
If you wanna pvp as fun as a night elf and shadowmeld is dwarf priests get fear ward which is arguable to most powerful ability in pvp. You will never have to worry about fear as a dwarf priest
---
I was just grabbing the FP and turning in a quest from stonetalon .-.
---
People grind SM/ZF the most, as those are huge xp/hr and that's primarily where the bottleneck is for leveling zones.
---
As such you can always try making the group!
---
You made me cry. Have an upvote.
---
Well done
---
That’s like saying don’t buy sports cars because all cars drive the same.
---
In your example, it’s AP=STRx2 before and AP=(STRx1.1)x2 after. At no point is it AP=STRx2.2. If you increase STR by 10%, your AP goes up but the modifier doesn’t. I think that’s what he’s trying to say.
---
Wait until the rain and storms start lol. So wet and dreary there. But it’ll always be special to me, got my first ever boe blue there way back in vanilla.
---
I'll never forget when my dad bought me another stick of 4gb ram. I hit login and was INSTANTLY in the Barrens and could run around with no lag. I was swearing with excitement and he had one of those very wholesome dad smiles. 
---
I used to take a flight path or login and go shower/eat a meal while my computer figured out how to process it. That was a great day.
---
people have always over hyped vanilla, most of em were kids or just wernt very good. so 10 years later they always remember how many times they wiped and compare it to how little they do. forgetting the 10 year experience gap
---
Plus the Rock Paper Scissors is played at class creation. 
---
You can still use skill and strategy after that in the actual battle to overcome playing paper against scissors.
---
You could atleast wait until he... you know build aggro?

Barrens

It bothers me that it's bound to Tab

Good point lets replace every character model with a gray sphere, that'll make things easier.  God you're a twat

As a blacksmith okay then I will!

Sure, why not.

Died of starvation, still leveling though.

This happened to me last night. A rogue was pulling mobs sometimes before we even finished the ones we were fighting. Then he would constantly switch targets causing everything to attack him. It was like he accidentally selected the wrong character when he logged in.
---
No one gives a fuck. Every post of an accomplishment, 15 replies stating their level.
---
&gt;Its gameplay we're after remember?
---
No silly, it's Classic we're after. If you want features from retail I suggest playing retail.
---
Eeh, this feels like one of those people who try to be random.
---
You're right, agility on those plate gloves would be way better for rogues.
---
what action bar addon is that?
---
go now to the nearest [one](https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=AUCTIONEER#npcs:0-3+1) appropriate to your faction

I used to have "You no take candle!" on Howl of Terror back in the day.

I bet you're the same kinda guy that rage quits dungeons after one wipe

There's going to be a small percentage of any population that are narcissists.  No help for those types not even therapy.  Just /pity /ignore and move on because you don't want them anywhere near you at any time for any reason if you're not one yourself!
---
Grats on 60, pro tip, keybind your pet attack/passive to mousewheel scroll and then camera zoom to shift+mousewheel it's been very helpful for me.
---
as a new player you wont be rushing, so youll have plenty of time to figure out new areas and new class abilities at your own pace. the theorycrafting people do doesnt really come into play until dozens of hours of play.
---
i wold suggest you pick a pve server, as the 'at your own pace ' thing largely goes away on pvp servers around level 20+ when you are in contested zones with the other faction.
---
WoW vanilla was the first game I played that wasn't isometric.  You'll be fine. :)
---
It's true. I work for Blizzard. I also work for CCP and Jagex. I'm also biased both ways.
---
&gt; entering combat with a flagged opponent

But yeah. Common woopsie ways to flag is via buffing, healing, or damaging a flagged player.

Man, im still looking for Gavin

Grind Rock Elementals in Badlands. Therr are a two good camps that have them level 39-40 or some in the southwest cornerthatare a bit higher. Since the grey items they drop stacks you can grind there for hours before filling up your bag. Easily make a couple G from that but the Elemental Earths sell fairly well
---
&gt; Ok so let me get this straight... Some guys that are friends but play on different factions decided to do something together, and you want them to get banned?
---
Illegal behavior that influences the economy deserves a ban.  You are being petty here.
---
You've just described so many groups I've been in, except I'm the healer. Any chance you're horde on Skeram? I'm Indolent a 47 priest atm
---
Reports 1st showed that Stalagg was 50/50 but I guess the Alliance all bailed. Seems we scared em off.
---
I hope things don't trend into overwhelming majority for one faction over the other on each server. When paid server transfer opens up things would get very lopsided.
---
And you're the kind of person who will play on a ghost town a month from now once this fad ends
---
I don't think you can name your pet while it's dismissed, as it is when flying.
---
Ok okay this would be last one. Will the gear say in the stats like +11 intellect + 8 spirit and +10 spell power ??
---
There is no fucking way in the world I would reroll after reaching lvl 37. NO FUCKING WAY.
---
I lvled 3 horde chars 9 months ago on a private server - 44 priest, 39 lock, 35 war.
---
I am SO FUCKING SICK of seeing all the zones up until Badlands that even thinking of them makes me wanna puke.
---
Now I'm lvling a shaman on classic, I'm already lvl 33 and can't wait to get to Badlands.
---
So no unarmored epic mounts in classic? I haven't gone to determine that yet.
---
Free Palestine

That shady mf saying all greed and rolling last

This was Wednesday night. Never had a queue on Benediction before this week.
---
Bear is a good tank for almost every dungeon, better than paladin for sure, be a bear. If you want to raid and ferals aren't wanted then respec at 60, but until then I wouldn't.
---
Rebound mine to R
---
Seems like OP fished in a school that someone else was already at, got told off, whispered the person and they replied. 
---
IMO fishing someone else's pool is akin to mining someone else's node, but to each their own, I guess
---
To me it sounds like you shouldnt be playing on a PvP server if that ganking is bothering you. Easiest solution is to play on a PvE server..
---
Pretty sure it’s just right click on your portrait frame -&gt; unlock -&gt; drag to the desired position. Same for enemy frame.
---
I had an underleveled rogue beg me to tank their ZF group, and when I said I wouldn't because they were too low level he told me to go fuck myself. Guess who's never getting a group from anyone in the 350 person guild I'm in.
---
how bad can you be at video guys lol
---
Lost connections of Azeroth.
---
move on. if you cant get a quest done, more quests are out there.
---
It got removed before 1.12
---
For me on alliance side it was always logic: 
---
SW : Swords, crossbow
---
IF: Axes, maxes, guns
---
Darn: Staffs, bows
---
I don't know, I thing d&amp;d spoiled me
---
I'm duo leveling as a warlock with a priest. We do like 75% quests and 25% dungeons to level. I've read that the priest can spec shadow at 40 and still heal dungeons fine but we have some doubts about that since some of the dungeons get rough sometimes on mana already as holy/disc. Does anyone have insight on this? For reference we both just hit level 40.
---
I love WoW economics. Its what got me into crypto currencies.
---
Darkshore was lovely when I was leveling there, general chat was basically only people helping others find quest locations and group up for difficult quests.
---
Then I went to Loch Modan and was treated to a discussion of "dark iron" dwarf crime statistics
---
Even though as a warlock you just cast Shadowbolt, there are still so many things to consider.  When to lifetap, when to wait for mana regen, when to move (certain bosses), which curses to apply and reapply, etc etc!   So even if you only cast a few things (seemingly) you are thinking about a lot
---
Doesn't work :(
---
For me it'd be an act of aggression and then it's fight time.
---
level doesn't determine the scaling, spell coefficients do.
---
tho just in case its not a troll post and youre being serious, i think you need to speak with a therapist. im honestly not saying that as an insult whatsoever and ive been to a therapist before. but this is a bigger problem than random reddit comments can handle.
---
Well done.  He deserved that.
---
Layer is not manual mechanism, it works automatically. There is no CHANGE LAYER button on your UI, now is there? Players are not the ones to decide "hmm, that layer has too much players gor my liking", that is why ITS NOT A MANUAL OPTION READILY AVAILABLE FOR YOU. People just found out a way to trigger it manually, but they were (and still are) exploiting it by doing it on a whim.
---
And mailbox is in the north
---
They're fine for dungeons, but are usually passed over for warriors in raids.
---
Not the actionbar his Health/Mana with portrait it’s in the middle instead  of top left
---
For me it is because I had done everything alliance already. Wanted to try out horde this time
---
I'd prefer to play on a server with people on it. My  mistake to transfer in the first place so I gotta live with the consequences
---
Grats man! Im 150g off and might get it when im home from work if my auctions sell!

Make your own groups. You're viable, and even very, very good, especially in 5-man content. If others won't take you, that's their loss.
---
What is your build?  Sounds fun
---
I do have 20 gold
---
At what level is the cloth quest repeatable?
---
In my experience, people are spamming so much for tanks...It may be a good way to level and put together a healing set along the way.  The more dungeons, the more opportunity.  And if the healer doesn’t need it, most people don’t have an issue with someone as vital as the tank snagging it for off-spec.
---
You can add things like lures and nightcrawlers to your fishing rod, they help you to catch up by boosting your fishing level allowing you to fish in higher level areas.
---
Yeah i use it already :) but its still a pain and it slows the connection a bit
---
Man I used those boots on my lock till my 40s when there's a Tanaris quest for something slightly better. And then I didn't upgrade those until BRD. Literally 3 boots from 27 to 60.
---
I think if they do it like Old school Runescape where people can vote for features to be implemented it can help to solve this problem.
---
A bugati and an Ford Fusion both get me to work and the grocery store the same speed. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.
---
This is just part of the game? Its always been like that. Nothing new. I have an alt to play for when stuff happens like this. Or try and gather a group of people, it can be fun. I got 5 people and killed the ?? It's exciting.
---
Obviously they do as people are replying. Maybe take a break from worrying about others and focus on yourself chief
---
And of course, this would only happen in a fantasy world.
---
Not +5, corruption and agony do not have a 100% spell power coefficient. It's more around +3
---
Ahh your an ironmeme, that explains it.
---
The scythe is used everywhere it’s bis, check the gear disc. https://discord.gg/7KZHZ38
---
The reason the scythe is used everywhere for mains is because tob/Cox is such a big step up in gp compared to other bosses that it’s worth killing everything else faster then doing tob with the time saved.
---
Example: I’m going for garg boss pet, that’s 3000 kills (assuming getting it on drop rate), I can get 30 kills/hr with scythe while without that number is closer to 18.  That means it takes 100hours with scythe or 166hours with welfare gear. That’s 66 hours I could do tob, that gives me 198 rolls on the tob pet as well as generating 858m (assuming tob items on drop rate).
---
Last I checked scythe/darts didn’t cost 8.58m/hr upkeep, especially when you factor in the amount of times your not swinging it during phase changes/banking .ect
---
if the enemy is much weaker tho like a green level mob you could ambush tho
---
he gonna miss more attacks on you anyway and you got a better chance to crit
---
It gives me hope that chromie will lead us in a new timeline after naxxramas.
---
The two best spec are hemo(and prep ofc)+cold blood and imp sprint + prep (and dagger). 
---
First one is much better against warrior and second one against mages.
---
Thank you :)
---
I do
---
I guess WoW was the WoW killer all along.
---
when you get consecration is when you can start.
---
I liked it
---
You turn off quest objectives. Then it only tells you we’re to pick up and turn in quests. I like it this way bc I still have to explore to do quests but I know I am not missing out on any quest.
---
Even with poisons?
---
*Laughs in purge*
---
Isn't it Auto bound to mouse 4?
---
Reported for botting?
---
Yoo some guy did this to me this morning but i was going to work so i declined it and thanked him. 
---
When i have mage water i usually give to someone before i log out
---
It is what it is man. 
---
I play horde and am ganked pretty frequently despite always helping out alliance when i see them. 
---
I understand it can be frustrating but the best course of action is usually to go to a different questing area or hit up dungeons for a little while until that area quiets down. Thats what i do. 
---
There have been plenty of times ill fly to Tanaris, hear about roaming gank squads and just nope out to Feralas for a little while. 
---
And as always, if its too frustrating to put up with, a PvE server might be more your style. Thats where i rolled in Vanilla and its not that bad, i wanted to try something different so im rocking pvp this time around. 
---
Good luck, buddy!
---
I use q easy to find on the edge of the letter keys.
---
Yea FIshing Buddy (Classic) is out
---
Lol :)) my nick name is Captain Haddock in all games so i named my charachter haddock too :)

I am now running an undead thanks to this comment

Thank you for your positive feedback guys, it is great encouragement for us to keep working on this, so hopefully you'll see more issues coming over the time! :-)

[As Barlows blog said](https://youtu.be/UmPrL3gfM4g?t=32)
---
Warlocks are beside hunters the only class with a pet. And because Blizzard apparently noticed what happens when you give  puberting, inebriated or puberting inebriateds the freedom to think of a name themselves... lead to warlocks being exactly not allowed to do this. (It is a rather hard to translate sentence). Instead warlock pets always get names that either sound like Norwegian cross-country-skiers or religious extremists from the middle east.
---
But.. It's his own faction mount. Not like rep grind was involved. 
---
Epic mounts have been sighted for days. I got mine three days ago.
---
Duel starts —&gt; warstomp into an already active retaliation —&gt; I close the video
---
One of their argument is about showing who the character is and what it farms.
---
Second one: hp is not shown and they don't know if it is safe to gank.
---
Goodluck tho :)
---
Maybe he spelled “fast” wrong while talking about BfA.
---
Ehhhhh.. that's not the reason
---
What else would you do, genuinely curious since i am rolling a Hunter in classic for the first time and its kinda annoying.
---
Sounds like an add on setting.
---
This must be the work of an enemy Stan!
---
Yeah have you heard of "Dictatorship" before?...
---
Gotcha. Thanks everyone for taking the time :)
---
Only 1500 lvl 60s on Herod? Yikes.
---
I play prot paladin, really fun to play something thats a little off meta. And people always gets suprised of how great it is in dungeons!
---
i'm solo levelling atm, with some dungeons on the side, haven't really been aoe grinding
---
ideally looking at doing some wpvp and raiding with my guild at 60
---
Q is polymorph
---
For +intellect and +spirit it will display in white text the same way most stats are shown.
---
Spell power isn't really an official stat, but an effect normally phrased along the lines of:
---
"Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by X"
---
See [this item](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7714) for example
---
I've always been amazed how chill people are when fishing. I can't think of one time I or another player stop catching fish just to attack someone haha.
---
The mafia isn't working though. Tons of people are farming their skins and undercutting the market. I myself moved more than 80 pieces. But yes, I have evidence too of some cross-faction going on, nothing this damming though. I always try to make myself a target to the participating horde to capture the evidence. 
---
Trying so hard in a 15 year old nostalgia trip is honestly should just make anyone pity them. Ironic considering they crave recognition.
---
With purples that are worth a buttload of gold, it's actually greedy for someone to take it because "it's an upgrade" so it's not uncommon for people to all roll need on valuable items to prevent ninjas.
---
Worth the couple extra points in feral after getting charge for extra outdoor movespeed as cat, or nah?
---
Whenever you find yourself in a 2v1 then within 5 minutes you'll see 4 horde buddies rolling up and you get steamrolled.
---
Release spirit, autowalk to corpse and grab some water...
---
It might not be the most fun to get ganked all the time, but the 60 experience with BGs insta queues are fun.
---
Haha
---
For example I only have a lvl 47 main wl with around 100 gold but I am now leveling a warrior and buying him the very best equipment for his level. 
---
It will come
---
I play Alliance but still /knee
---
What kind of gear would  be looking for if I want to be carrying a healing set while leveling druid for 5-mans? What stats are good for healing gear as I'm leveling?
---
There aren't any quests that are race specific, only faction specific and class specific. There also isn't a main story line. Some quests are just really random and don't lead to another quest, others are long, iconic quest chains that do tell a story. Vanilla didnt have structured quest chains like you get in retail today so don't fret about it.
---
Its just a game why you have to be mad?
---
Auctioneer has come with sidebar for years.
---
If everyone just need rolls then this entire problem would be avoided

---
Is this eek the cat???
---
whys everyone keep mentioning salt? yes i eat a lot of salt so i probably contain more than i should. my diet has nothing to do with you guys.
---
Absolutely, i never played classic b4 and i just learned it by playing it. And im having a blast. 
---
But if you want a smoother experience you should look up classes that are easier for solo play, if you play solo
---
Great example and answer. Thank you!
---
If your interested I worked it out a while back while having this exact discussion, so it will be in my post history somewhere.
---
Scythe cops a bad rap because it’s expensive per swing (compared to bp that’s cheep per dart but fires 2.5x as often... 
---
The other thing to keep in mind is that scythe is a 20-35% dps increase most places it’s used, while the bow is normally only 5-15%.
---
This is especially important for thing like cerb where kills/trip matters (because it’s a long run back). Better dps = boss dies faster (incl often skipping mechanics altogether) = less supplies used per kill = more kills/trip = significant kills/hr boost.
---
Glad to have you in-game and hope that you are able to stay playing with us for a long time!  
---
May the winds guide your journey well, Haddock.
---
remindme! 5 days
---
My rogue trainer said I needed some weird juice called Mana before he would teach me polymorph.
---
During the first and second week, I rolled an alt druid on Thunderfury. Best of luck logging in, not sure why I'm lucky, but I hope you get lucky, too!
---
I dont mind having it but i dont think classic needs ****of the monkey costing 20g just for the mog appearance like on retail, and many other boe already at a decent price
---
Nice! Good luck :)
---
Could be but my personal experience on the realm shown me that its close to being true .
---
You think you do
---
Still saving money for that mount I guess? It's crazy how many spells people skip due to bad gold management.
---
&gt;Too much Flash BS on there for it to work properly.  
---
I can tell you all the Blizzard websites have zero Flash elements on them.
---
Tank starts pulling:
---
Literally everyone in my party: Hey little mamma let me whisper in your ear let me get those waters my dear!
---
I wish this was common TBH. Had a 22 warrior in our BFD last night that needed damn near everything. Like, yes, they were obviously upgrades (he couldn't even equip most yet) but I got fuck all out of that run but a giant repair bill.
---
Intellect increases your mana pool &amp; helps you gain skills (like weapon skill/wand skill) quicker.  
---
You'll need to balance the two, if you feel like you'd benefit from a bigger mana pool, go int, otherwise go spell power.
---
There is a point to be made, that if your spells are hitting hard enough you wont need to cast them as much.
---
Also just farm some mobs the old fashioned way, especially when travelling between places. That way you won't out level the zone and may even be a level ahead of the quests you're on, making life a lot easier.
---
My greatest mistake since rolling prot paladin.
---
Oh no I've never had a queue the entire time I've played classic. Finally coming to my server
---
Make some friends and travel in groups?
---
It will get better once the pvp honor system is introduced.
---
Very good advice for anyone!
---
Your griffin must be named Audi
---
You may not care about immersion, but some of us do. I've seen people argue that transmog doesn't hurt or even helps immersion, and I think these people must be on some hardcore drugs.
---
I recommend checking out this Google Doc. Go to slide 49 for the spec you’re looking for. Multi-dotter is perfect for levelling with a healer. 
---

right click or shift right click and press Move Frame or something, maybe Unlock Frame... then drag and drop

ah that takes me right back
---
Alliance here... I tip my hat off to you sir well done.
---
I will leave you with this advice...
---
Don’t back peddle..
---
i responded to the asker
---
You are life tapping to the point of increasing your threat past the tanks.
---
So you're doing it wrong. 
---
Don't expect a healer to save cover your ass just because you aren't doing the right thing. 
---
DPS have one fucking job, hit the targeted enemy keeping your threat under the tanks. That's it.
---
Day 1-2 I bought level 19 twink items for 1g apiece. Those are just gonna chill in my bank til BGs open.
---
Is it just me or have rolls been super close a lot in classic ?
---
Hurt by it? I prefer to mock the shitty lifetap spammers who think they need to burn then regen all their mana. Kinda like OP. Already mentioned in another part of this thread, if the healer is able to notice you are life tapping more than a hot covers, you are playing lock wrong.
---
look for you class discord and should be information there
---
Ay nice one
---
Unless you decide that you want your experience to be more about end game content.
---
in vanilla, how your character looks determines their progression, Are they Wearing high ranking PVP gear, are they in t1,t2 or t3? What spec are they?
---
Thank you!:) worth mentioning that I dont plan to farm dungeons until 60, just as a level 35 frost mage it's the most efficient thing right now. Plus its pretty fun when you have a group and can handle 10 mob pulls
---
Wish they'd fuck off from me mobs tho
---
Haha these people are terrible and should have rolled pve. My friends never had problems pvping alliance back in the day. Now the horde have 'OP' raciAals oh nooooo
---
&gt;I got a mage to 30, but after seeing screenshots it is 100% Frostbolt spam
---
You fucking kidding me?
---
Mages are probably the most dynamic and skill intensive class in wpvp.
---
You get to decide which targets to blast and which to immobilize, put up shields, blink around the battlefield and so on.
---
And as to pve...all classes have a boring rotation in pve. It's fucking pve, just press a few buttons and then repeat.
---
Update: There is like 30 alliance players behind Armory doors hiding xD
---
It’s the only logical solution
---
We should replace the entire sub with that sentence.
---
Awwwww how cute Classic players are learning why no one PuGd 40 man raids in vanilla.
---
tab + # is faster than navigating mouse and right clicking.
---
True, true
---
Why would you make a ticket for that?
---
Thank you for this lol
---
I would sell my soul to be able to play as a merloc
---
get used to going to every zone in your level range to do quests. at 28 the mobs in arathi and stv will eat you alive.
---
thats an epic mount and change
---
When ever someone randomly messages me I ask them where they are and run all the way to the opposite side of the map. You want it come and get it.
---
Oh no, downvotes, my only weakness!
---
Now my opinion will be similar to yours and I will start breeding cute little parakeets.
---
Because that's how downvotes work, right?
---
Windfury is pretty meaningless compared to mana tide but it doesn't have mana tide either. The key of what makes it "good enough" is the instant burst heal so it can save people if needed.
---
Key being though? Not enough guilds care that it matters to me.
---
Merges almost immediately, it may even be possible to do other races starting quests, I can't remember for sure.
---
Boomkin = Oomkin.
---
Yeah I agree, every contested zone I've been in has more horde than alliance so far.
---
I think it's mostly the asmongold fans that probably already stopped playing that are inflating the numbers.
---
It can also just be that more alliance players are reporting the numbers.
---
Tbh just download any addon to remove the gryphon bars around your actionbars and default is real nice. Move around healthbars if you like. And might i recomend one addon or other that shows castbars on nameplates
---
Your blizzard is bound to your middle mousebutton
---
Why is this comment downvoted lmao
---
Down time between pulls is normal, especially for large pulls. Make sure to drink up properly. Mobs should also be CCed (hunter traps, mage polymorph, rogue sap, etc.) and targets prioritised (someone, usually the tank, will set a skull on the first target to burst down, and a red cross for the second). This should reduce overall damage done to the party. Also "cluster" spells if you can afford to, ie no one is going to die immediately. By doing this you give yourself a chance for the 5 second rule to kick in (mana starts to regen after 5 seconds of not casting a spell), and then cast a few spells in succession.
---
You just summed up the warrior quests...
---
Dude, my first attempt to get to Ironforge was to hug the ocean coast all the way to the Menthril Harbour, go to the cave connecting the Wetlands to Lock Modan, then through the mountains. Had a real BRUH moment finding that tram for the first time.

Ouch! I hope you had a luck and fell into water and not on the hard ground

See, this is insane to me as well. I'm Horde on Herod and the past 3 nights in STV have been Alliance dominated.
---
I believe Horde out number, but it's NOT 38/62.
---
Buzzek in gadgetzan
---
No one cares. We aren't your friends. Go away.
---
They say it. They don't live up to it. Correct version is "Red and outgeared or outleveled = dead". As of now the only way to detect outgearing is by visuals.
---
Boomkin is called Oomkin for a reason.
---
It's trash end game and even worse for leveling.
---

The pink one and name it Floyd cuz Pink Floyd. I remember getting the white core hound in silverpine and naming it fluffy then had his whole sorry macroed and little commands macroed into my attacks. Some people thought it was annoying but they can go f themselves :)

never thought about the level factor... thats probably why it has been busier than last week

Sit on it and wait. Even if it doesn't go up, by then the G you could have now will be negligible. I've sold a few blues, but the top twink items are worth holding for a while.

Devs said they were in the original game for only a short period, and they didn't want people to rush to 60 before the mounts disappear for bragging rights.

Everybody get a load of how jealous this guy is! LOL!
---
Why don't you go roll another toon on Mograine for about 10ish levels?  
---
That'll give more time for servers to adjust and you can reevaluate at that time.  Plus, puts an alt there ready to go in case you do decide to move later?

I use a pair of Sennheiser HD 595SRs that I've had for a few years. A bit expensive but worth it. I used to get the cheap ones from Bestbuy but they maybe lasted a year at most.

Rexxar doesn't attack Alliance players.
---
So I am not going crazy then!

You know there is a stop watch you can use from the clock
---
and lots of classes have increased str/allstats talents and buffs and things
---
saw something similar, a guild with &lt;Class Trainer&gt;  
---
Made me double take plenty of times, especially since I didn't know you could flag for pvp for green names..
---
If strikes at me how overall the races choice and the classes are pretty much balanced.
---
In this age of min-maxing people chose what they feel more fun playing rather than the cookie cutter combinations.
---
I don't remember this except for greens. Blues and purps we're consistently needed on in Vanilla in PUGs. No one wanted to risk being ninja'd.
---
If you get tattoos and care about what the haters say then I guess you don’t have thick skin! Since playing this game from 2004 I have only the fondest memories with my friends and family, so I only wish someday everyone can find something their passionate about enough to get a tattoo for!
---
this is weird because the flooded shimmering flats as a zone was generally more fun in Cata unless you hated every modicum of gameplay innovation

Is it just me or is that quest easier for the Horde? I felt like every location was close to a Horde travel hub.
---
Layers try to create a balanced world. You have to consider an overwhelming majority are hidden inside instances.
---
the AI is not bound to the same pathing restrictions as we are. So if you think you're in an impossible location, they will still scale that vertical cliff face as if it was nothing. Was like that back in Vanilla, sadly

oh yeah didnt think of that. but seriously WoW, at least van-wrath, has always been all need on BoEs. all these counter arguments really seem to be coming from retail babies who cant handle not getting a drop. ive never used the term retail babies until now.

Y’all don’t have to justify your gaming headsets to me. My point is, if your looking at gaming headset, for price of a decent gaming headset can get better sound buy buying better components at close to the same cost.

Yes but it increases ur STR by 10% therefore increases your attack power from str by 10% too.

---
Seems like there aren't many tanks for the early dungeons. As a tank I find groups quickly, but even as a healer it's tough to find a group. Barrens chat, city trade chat and lookingforgroup are all worth trying to find people in.

such a guild exist?
---
some people spend eight levels in SM, might as well get some upgrades too. but yeah ive seen people laser focus on dungeons for drops off eare mobs that dont even spawn. most runs,its weird.
---
&gt;Hopping layers to get new spawns is literally what it was made for.

That is what started this comment chain. This is the counterpoint, think about this little harder.
---
P-P-P-P-POOOOWEER!
---
Also increases your chance to crit with spells.
---
Im not implying that classic is a perfectly balanced game. Im saying that rock paper scissors is and that every game follows those rules to make their game as balanced as possible. How successful each game is on doing it is up for debate. Ask any game dev how they balance their games and they will tell you that its basically rock paper scissors.
---
Making a perfectly balanced game is the easiest thing in the world. Symetrical map, identical characters, 1v1. There, this is 100%, perfectly balanced. As soon as you have some variation for example classes you will follow rock paper scissors rules. Every class needs advantages and disadvantages, Bad and good matchups. This makes rock paper scissors perfectly balanced. Of course in a game like wow it is a lot more complex because there is so much more variation compared to rock paper scissors, there are more than 3 classes, there is gear and many many other factors. Im not arguing that rock paper scissors is balanced in a way that is fun in videogames. No one wants to have a 100% win chance against someone and 0% against someone else. But the concept remains the same.
---
If you want everyone to have 50% winrate against everyone then we are going back to the previous concept i mentioned of a perfectly balanced game, the only way to achieve that is by it being symetrical and everyone being the same. This leads to class pruning and will never be achieved anyway unless they all turn out the same in the end.

Scaling of gear just made people quit as there is no point at all next patch it's all obsolete gearing is the ONLY time I would socialize on retail... mythic raid aren't scaling content? LFR/Normal/heroic/mythic if that ain't a gear scale wtf mate. Dungeon finder did cause this mess in the first place if you think socializing is clicking a button never saying a word if you do be meet with silence or stfu and face rolling a instances in 5 minutes than no point to argue further. Like calling a match making game a MMO because it's online.

You can release demons with a macro, intended for Hunter pets, and then resummon to reroll. However, you'll need to buy all their spells again once you've got an acceptable name, and there are like 800 different permutations, so pickiness is a big investment.

And before they try to claim it's "low effort" I spent about thirty minutes in Sketch making this masking items and choosing fonts.
---
I haven't seen much of it personally, but it is amusing thinking about purists bragging on reddit which didn't exist back then.
---
The editing and watermarks make this completely unwatachable.

A 5 minute highlight reel would have done much better.

you can with addons
---
First I guarantee I've played WoW longer than you've been alive and second its literally against the ToS to cross faction collude. This is not "every mmo" either. You're literally advocating for letting one group of players hold the entire servers economy hostage. And guess what I'm a mage so I don't even care about devilsaur leather I just think it goes completely against the spirit of Vanilla because it wasn't allowed in 2005 and it shouldn't be allowed now to collude with the other faction.
---

I’ve stopped posting stuff under 40. It’s all like 10% above vendor and I rather not deal with ah for a 10% gain on 5silver items...
---
There must be a reason why gold farming bots were always rogues. They are great at farming at 60.
---
No, but they will mark your map for a trainer in UC. I don’t know if you were being sarcastic or not but it wouldn’t be much help if they ignored the trainer in their own city and marked one in another major area for you instead. That would be pretty asinine.
---
stay with your group, don't pull aggy if you can help it, don't complain about drops. its pretty straightforward.
---
Not sure if it would be an improvement over what you use, but you might try and see if Proton VPN works for you - it seems to have quite a few european servers that offer pretty good connection speeds.
---
That's not a knife. 
---
***That's*** a knife.
---
I barely have time to play these days, so I'd rather not have to brawl fools every time I'm out questing in contested zones
---
I just never understood the dungeon grind meta. Sure, there is a lot of fun at 60, but there is so much of the world and cool quests that you mess when you are staring at the same walls for 20 levels.
---
Prf dude. I ALMOST let a tear out. gl. I hope that’s not the case my dude.
---
Blizzard increasing cooldown on it so people stop abusing it as much is not very "open to interpretation" though. And no - point of layers in the firstplace was to offset player numbers so we get normal experience. Again - it's not for player to decide, it's done automatically.
---
Are you seriously role-playing? Cringe
---
&gt;You'd be insane to sell edgemasters as a tank
---
Why? I can sell edgemasters and then just get the next-bis item from a drop. Meanwhile, I have an extra 1k+ gold for my epic mount or consumables or other gear I have to buy/craft.

I'm a filthy casual
---
I just don't buy this. Obviously you can tell gear, but I just saw a video of a paladin killing a mage who was red to him. Yes, gear matters somewhat, but I'd wager skill matters more than someone completing a quest for an item. 
---
Regardless, I said it could be made so that only you could see your transmog gear. How would you feel about that?

if youre a warrior, 3 mage 1 priest groups are quite good for obvious reasons, you get anything you want and they fight over caster gear.

They're faceless strangers from other servers that you have 0 chance of running into again. They might as well be NPCs. You can't even trade with them, no one talks to anybody.

I did a lot of dungeons to farm pre raid BIS. I go up in gold little by little. Sometimes one run would net me 10+ gold because I get like a 2 handed green/blue weapon + some junk.

Grind a few levels in Thousand Needles? Just north of Freewind Post is a good spot for centaurs till 29. Then you can do wyverns till 32ish.
---
My favourite thing is when someone says go back to retail about something that isn't even in retail. At all.
---
I'm specced 32 points prot rest in retribution.
---
Protection is a good leveling spec in my opinion, along with improved speed from ret. 
---
You dont need a single point in holy to heal in my leveling experience. Have int gear on hand and you'll be fine. 
---
If you're talking max level you might want spiritual focus but you wont need movement speed as much so that opens up. You can even still get seal of command/spiritual focus/holy shield to ensure 2h dmg when you need it.

Even phonetically it's Ogar

In tbc is was still divided into bonus healing and damage, it wasn’t till wotlk that they combined then both into spell power

Well, greet the orc with: "Throm'kar, warrior and salute him"
---
Although the warrior probably won't understand your explicitly bad orcish they usually understand your salutation and don't attack you.
---
^(It works surprisingly well for me in STV, but I think I am just lucky...)
---
How about the reward for any kind of interaction is the ability to speak to the other faction. That's it.
---
Believe me it's unreasonable to us too. Majority of our people dont support the regime and don't want war on anyone.
---
I wish I could upvote this comment more.
---
I never had a chance to really play vanilla besides the free trial. I must say it really is refreshing coming from retail to classic and realizing how involved in the world you are with everybody. It's so fun going from each zone and stumbling upon people doing the same quest or objective. I play on a pvp realm and it's even fun leveling in contested areas. You really dont realize how much group finders have kind of hindered the whole MMO experience until you play classic. This is probably the most fun I've had playing any game in over a decade honestly.
---
Hugs to you friend!
---
IDK about diminishing returns but i know that you are better off stacking crit and hit up to a point and AP is one of the last stats you build while maintaining your crit and hit since those have much steeper DR's
---
Ive seen people roll a 98 then loot the chest right away cause they assume they win 😂😂
---
why would one realm have a higher population of mages compared to others? what part of the realm would cause that? the name?
---
I can’t wait. Only 28 here. :(
---
I tell ya it sounds like you haven't actually played much group content though.  You certainly do pick a totem or curse to help your party, by changing your talents based on the content you're doing.  And there've only been a handful of nonlinear quest lines in the game ever (which faction to support in desolace is one of the only examples I can think of in classic) and they just added the biggest quest branch the game has ever had this last patch.  The leveling combat is very very easy on retail, certainly, but world quests certainly make the world feel like a world to me.  
---
I'm currently 45 on a warrior on classic and man do I miss retail something fierce.  But I want to raid MC/BWL/AQ again and maybe even get to fight vanilla KT this time, so I'll suffer through it.  I certainly feel like I'm playing a different game then everyone in this sub though, heh.

No, of course. Layers hide everything. 
---
I just want Herod to have a healthy balance when P2 drops.
---
I grind dungeons when I cant find a good quest set for my level. Im playing with no addons and sometimes I dont know where to go. Its been really cool watching zones like stv go from scary places to being the biggest guy around. Also when I hit 60, I can make a new character!
---
Right I agree. What I’m saying is the mage who’s bitching about xp per hour should seek out a group specifically advertising as a spell cleave group. He can’t complain about xp/hour if he’s not in a cleave group. 
---
I’m in the same boat as you, I just want to run the dungeons, don’t gaf about group comp,
---
I hate it when I take a redundant shit.
---
I had a lvl 41 Tauren warrior do this to me back when I was at 37. I guess they did it thinking it would be funny, but I just ended up killing them. So I guess in the end it was kinda funny.
---
Wow dude, a dps has to wait? That’s insane!
---
I'd normally agree but different dialects say A and o words differently

yea WSG is about flag running.  But ARATHI BASIN was all about flag defending and movement.  Druids were gdlk at those

Thank you for your kind words :)
---
If you learn to totem twist you can find a slot in a raid. People are weird about min-maxing. Just play what sounds fun.
---
Your friends suck
---
Meanwhile, I’m an orc rogue on a pvp server and I /wave everyone in STV and we quest next to each other. 
---
I think the game is oddly peaceful because there is no honor incentive to kill.
---
What about sex, you guys havin any of that?
---
So lucky. Lol
---
It’s hilarious people are so ignorant about this. I’m actually the nice guy who tells people to all need in these situations but responses like this make me not even want to do that. People just have no concept of opportunity cost.

And that’s why I’m back! I loved the leveling aspect of Classic WOW. The challenge of getting to 60 revives a lot of old memories.
---
yes they do..
---
if you would have looked at them he wrote it  and said :its his friend and  he was ok with him having the weapon if he got the karma , guess his friend wanted both  ;)
---
I think battleground queues are going to be cross-server.
---
So happy to see fresh 14 year olds playing the game, was worried for a minute it would only be those of us in our 30s reliving the experience.
---
They are asking for paladins because of AoE farms I think? But yeah,
---
Is a soul shard bag ever a good idea? I don't know why I'd want to lose a bunch of slots that work for anything just so I can have a bunch of extra soul shards.
---
This, exactly!
---
I would say your "extreme" view is likely closer to reality. The largest issue with census addons is they only work when you're playing. Unless you're playing 24 hrs a day they're going to be inaccurate no matter how many analysis techniques you do. As I've said, the data in inherently faulty. It can give you a very rough estimate, but to act like it's anything more than that is folly.
---
The game in fact would force us to split the 400g drop if it were in coins. There's no built in way to make sure that a BoE that has this much value is evenly split among the members of the group. IMO the most fair way to proceed is to give everyone in the group an equal shot at gaining that windfall.

---
any news about stonetalon from last night ?
---
Yeah, I know they do.  It was kind of implied...
---
The tank focused one would be my choice. Having holy shield and cons. Is great for dungeons. Hurts not getting holy power but if you manage your mana well it shouldn't be an issue as you gear up.
---
because we dont want it
---
Dalaran during legion was always full of players on my server.
---
&gt;  but if you remember one of the reasons they added Blood Elves to the horde was to entice more women to choose horde. 
---
Where did you hear about this?
---
only the 400th repost
---
Isn't it decent for pvp once geared?
---
in cities there are no different servers. all is your server. NPC count is similar to classic. and you can trade with people in cities. no one talks to anybody in classic orgrimmar as well.
---
Hes leveling, not raiding naxx. You dont have to min max everything lol. Also, i couldnt care less about the "reputation" of pally tanks. The people who think they are bad are morons parroting the opinions of other morons who have no actual experience.
---
&gt;People in pugs and green stuff clean MC and co right now
---
Yes, literally the top 0.01% of players. Doesn't matter if it's a pug because those are all seasoned gamers. Don't make it sound like anyone in green will just pug MC and clear it.
---
if you are converting actual str to actual ap.  but this is comparing str on items to ap on items, so you would in fact want to factor in bok
---
I would also say this when I want to prevent players to name the demons blueslaveguy and Mr. Blueberry
---
I like Miko's Floating Combat Text. Customizable and easy to do so. Check it out.
---
I believe you can hide player names unless they’re in your group. I’m not aware of any other ways.

time to re roll or join a blacklisted guild i guess

---
As a Priest I still hit that mental panic button. "Power Word Shield" when I'm falling and still die.
---
The people begging for chance to group with players on other realms was even more of an issue with end game content and those from dead servers, not solely because of leveling.  Again, it was a great boon to leveling, yes.  But the people complaining they couldn't get Heroic dungeon groups, especially at a time where nost gearing was based on Badges that came from dungeons as well as raids, was the main reason it was added.  The fact is, if it was solely a leveling issue, they wouldnt have cared because you could have continued leveling without them and gotten to ens game and kept playing.  For those on dead servers, it was literally making the game unplayable because they couldnt do anything in game and was risking those people unsubbing.  That means loss of revenue.  That is something that would motivate Blizz to do something.
---
It was great that LFG helped leveling and getting dungeon groups, but the reality is, you could always level to max without running a single dungeon (as boring and unfun as that sounds) so Blizz had no reason to add a feature like LFG and cross realm to aid leveling.
---
Meh my rule has always been if you need something then you best put it on and use it.
---
Hoho
---
Oh, I'm sorry, I've been at work, not scrolling through reddit all fucking day.  Excuse the shit out of me.
---
that's why skinning a bear should aggro every bears
---
Bear tanks are viable for pretty much all content, only lacking in some main tanking roles in raiding, look up some of Taladril's guides, also come check out the classic druid discord. It's a great resource.
---
It keeps people off you but it also means you ain't killing anyone 1v1 in world pvp because everyone can just walk away from you
---
Think of it like a first person shooter. If you're helping the opposite side, you get banned. Same situation here. If you want to help Alliance farm a mob, join that faction.
---
The tie rolls right now are serious
---
my midlevel herbs didnt sell either
---
Whichever was selected during character creation.
---
Whats annoying is even if they are not in your group you get less if he helps. I was fighting some mobs, not asking for any help and the high level guy came and did 1-2 spells on the mob. When it died I got significantly less xp than from the next one where he didnt help
---
They could've named it. I renamed my Crab to Crab when I first played vanilla, and it's had the same name ever since!
---
same could only stomach is for a few minutes.
---
If you don't have an auto shot timer you need one
---
WoW always needed some natural mechanism to encourage server balance. Maybe once the population skews more than 55/45 it should prompt people to pick the underrepresented faction on character select, even maybe giving them a bit of an xp boost or something to really encourage new players to even out the faction balance. I don't want to world PvP when it's just us stomping the alliance through sheer weight of numbers.
---
If you  don't buy the skill when available, and level up and then buy it will it produce 4 or do need need to buy the skill then ding?
---
|
---
You know the disenchant value part of the addon is bugged right?
---
It's not even the racials per say although that does factor in. The fact that pallies are on the alliance side makes raiding much much easier. The dps gain from windfury and shamans are negligible even now since people are mowing bosses down. The utility and healing pallies bring are ez mode in a pve environment.
---
How do you server scan?
---
re worded =)
---
Ranged pull is shitty in terms of threat
---
Yeah I’m fixing to get the fuck off Stalagg as alliance. STV horde population is bonkers and it’s only going to get worse.
---
Dang badass here
---
Vendor prices are pretty close to AH prices. Taking the time and paying the AH fee IMO outweighs the small amount of extra money.
---
But if you don't need the item and need anyway then there's literally no difference between what you're doing and ninja looting.
---
You're just ninja looting because you feel justified in it, but that's still what you are.
---
Any reason why I keep disconnecting from the server every 5 mins?
---
I learned my lesson.
---
4.3 million players in US/EU? Way more than I expected
---
Lmao just saw the just lost on a tie roll post
---
Skull is obviously the one that should be killed first. Not sure about the others, but as a tank I use them to mark mobs for cc
---
Fear
---
Sure.
---
That’s why I stressed positioning is important
---
That would be aboomer, alltho it would come more clear when people know their bis list I'd assume.
---
I might be all wrong but I would pay more than 80g for a bis piece I can get for no time spent farming. I guess u could undercut and sell it now if you need the gold, but it could get more worth in the future (untill decent other boots are aviable for the prot wars)

Don’t argue with morons, they will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. 
---
Yes it’s a 10% buff to str, but functionally it’s the same as (when discussing AP) 1str = 2.2ap. Thus str, is marginally more valuable as a generator of AP for alliance than it would be for horde.
---
there arent target dummies in classic you foooooooool

Tin foil hat bullshit.

Game devs make a shitty game; This game fucking sucks! why cant they make fun, addictive games anymore?! 
---
Game devs make really fun, addictive game; HOLY SHIT THEY MUST BE USING SOME KINDA PSYCHOLOGICAL SUBLIMINAL MESSAGING MIND FUCK MAGIC!!!
---
Ridiculous.
---
Is there a resource for server populations and/or alliance/horde breakdown?
---
Hell it's about damn time.
---
I normally name my pets according to what they aren’t. Owl? Named cat. Cat? Named Boar.
---
Skull is the first thing to die, x is second. Moon is for sheep. The rest are less well defined and don't usually matter much because the tank usually has good threat by then.
---
On old server proudmoore?
---
He followed me home, can I keep him?
---
"Good" could be relative here.
---
If you're looking, maybe make friends with the people who are doing said activities that you also enjoy.  The next pug you join, ask them if their guilds are looking.
---
Be friendly, humble, eager, and outgoing and any guild will want to snatch you up with minimal effort on your part.
---
Fel Domination and its follow up talent
---
I have 180 int, +140 fire damage, and a 5.2% crit chance. Its a shitload of fun, especially in world pvp if I'm not initiated on
---
You won’t enter combat if you stand in the right place. Lol.
---
Wait. Drugs are now political incorrect? Why? They are mostly illegal, I get that, antisocial, ok, but pic? Please elaborate!
---
Simple, he made it up. What I imagine really happened in TBC was that they couldn't fit in paladins with the lore of current horde races. They added blood elves to horde to allow them the ability to bring that class over to horde since the plan was to make shamans and pallies available to each faction.
---
&gt; Every single one of your arguments was "I ~~don't~~ like this therefore ~~you shouldn't be doing this~~ *it should be allowed*". My response was I don't care about what you want.
---
I get where you’re coming from - but a guild making the decision to transfer off a server can destroy the guild. You end up with half the members who want to stay on the server they committed to (and made new friends on) and don’t want to risk playing on a “dead server” and the other half who are happy to transfer. I’ve already heard of a few guilds imploding due to the transfers, so I’m not surprised many guilds are very wary of doing such a move.
---
I had also forgotten how well themed the world was, places feel really unique, and having to run through them shows areas and mobs I wouldn't interact with otherwise. Im also doing it without any addons. Truly a crazy experience.
---
ding dong your spells are gone
---
Lvl 17, can't wait till get to lvl 20 so I can Blink!
---
A slow leveller would probably hit 60 in about 20ish days /played, so if you average 8 hours of playtime a week it'll take you more than a year to hit 60
---
Lol you thought it was a complaint in a humor post 😂 go watch more streams kid.
---
yeah, speeding too 60 no ?
---
just killed a man
---
The last part feels like a personal attack. Healing is so much better after a few whiskeys.
---
Yeah it is, mine was telling me I would get 3-4 Illusion Dust from disenchanting Level 36 Black mageweave leggings I made with tailoring lol.
---
SM = Shadow Mastery, the 25-30 point talents in affliction. Increases shadow damage and life stealing abilities by 10%. Ruin is the 21 point talent in destruction but i cant remember off the top of my head exactly what it is, I think increases destruction critical damage by 100% so shadow bolt does way more
---
Because he's backwards as fuck. Why would you take a picture with your phone, to transfer it to your pc, to edit it and make it into a meme, when you could have taken the screenshot, to begin with? Like it's going on the pc anyway.

Low loyalty level. Keep them fed, and check their loyalty level in their character screen.

Pop balance on pvp servers is VERY CLOSE to 60/40, which is horrible, and exactly what I was saying.

Find a boss. Get a healer. That’s a target dummy.

Extinct you say.

No way man, my pet is literally denoted as being my best friend.
---
Int isn't even good lol, I'd take 10 spirit over 15 int on any class
---
Didn’t this one show up yesterday though?
---
The heals were fine, the problem is a pally tank. They weren’t called healadins for nothing back in vanilla. This isn’t retail it’s classic. Classes need to know there role lol

You forgot to add akdj jsid jsid jahdhais haidhsh jahdhais idhshshd jahdhais haidhsh jahshajshs jahdhais bhshsvsha bush's gu hjshdgsjsv jshshsh to make it not low effort.

I'm leveling as prot and it didn't feel like a strong aoe grinding spec (solo). But maybe i did it wrong. Most comments i saw said not to try aoe grinsing as prot.
---
If you're in a group and come across a chest, you /roll for it. I make an exception for locked chests because it wouldn't be opened unless the rogue/blacksmith was there to open it, so it never made any sense to me for anyone else to roll on it. The loots the rogues. In my experience and when I'm the rogue, people are more than happy to give up goodies from inside if someone requests it, but this is not always to be expected. 
---
If you come across a chest in the wild I w usually first come first serve. However if you roll up on someone fighting mobs near the chest and it's clear what their goal is, it's usually considered a dick move to loot it while they fight. I usually help them kill the mobs.
---
For the n we thing usually you need if the item is usuable to you and you intend to use it ASAP, and it's a clear upgrade for your main spec or the dungeon role you're filling. Any there some nuance. For example if you have no neck piece and you're a warrior and a neck with 2 stamina and 8 intellect drops, yes. That is an upgrade for you and would help you. Personally I'd pass on it and let the healer or mage need it. It's just a better for them. Not everyone plays with such self restraint and loot stuff will be hotly debated until the end of time.
---
If you plan on selling an item, I greed. That's the definition of greed. Again very hotly contested and mine seems to be a minority opinion. You just have to do what you think is right. Sometimes for yourself and for the other players.
---
Perfect thanks
---
Love hunters that don’t name their pets... I mean no one else gets to customize shit BUT YOU CHOOSE TO NAME YOUR PET CAT
---
Yup, WoW should too. I never liked the split populations in WoW, it divided the playerbase unnecessarily.

Being Alliance on this server has been rough since the transfers.

Yeah get itemrack, I forget which site the download was but you can find it on willitclassic
---
Your ranged pull isn't your threat generator, it just ensures you start with threat, making it easier to maintain. It's much better than having to grab threat from a DPS.
---
Classic wowhead just put out some numbers on their site
---
Are you using addons?  Disable all of them.
---
If this solves the issue then you can enable them one by one to determine what is causing the issue.
---
If you don't use addons, try simple things like changing your internet cable hardwire or checking firewall settings.

whether or not a player is controlling layer switching is not relevant here. you just are not high enough IQ to understand the discussion material

Laptop wise take a look at metal capable Mac Book Pros circa 2013, one with a SSD. It's fairly simple for me to clone the drives and swap out an HDD for an SSD but this is probably considered medium technical difficulty.  So depending on your experience you may want to look for one with one already installed.  This is assuming you want to stay in this $400 range of course.  
---
If not then you have a ton of options in the 700-1000 range especially if you can hold out a bit to capitalize on the holiday season discounts.
---
Almost anything new will run classic though so if you want to go that route check out:

Wrong af.  
---
I'm on Stalagg as Aliance, lvl 33, I never see "more" horde going to contested regions, it's pretty split, and I never felt like there is no alliance nearby to help me, always people.  
---
I'm quite sure it's like 45% Alliance to 65% Horde AT LEAST.
---
That's perfect! Thank you so much!
---
Was wondering the same thing, I've seen the trio of Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism running around.
---
That might be it actually, I added some other addons this morning
---
"hey we did this thing that has nothing to do with 9/11 on the most imbalanced population server haha"
---
There is an addon called Fishbringer as well, i prefer it over Fishing Buddy since it is simpler
---
Which female US Representative was playing as the Palestine character?
---
Yeah the coefficients on most (all?) spells improves over ranks.
---
Now you can name your pet!
---
I’m level 40, and most of the people I do it too are under level. They don’t want to fight me
---
Yeh I thought storm wind looked like Tokyo
---
Phonetically I hear :"Loktaro Gar!" so you're absolutely right there.
---
This exact chest, someone told me to sap a mob and after we finish the group we’ll roll - and then went for the steal. Well fuck him, I sapped it, saw it. Opened that trade window. Vanished. Outta combat, the chest was mine! Got the BoE blue. I shove it in his face, guy tries to flame me in gen. I shed light on the sitch and now he’s known as the wetlands weenie.
---
Wingman and Cat a tale as old as time.
---
Undead and orc combined is just too good. And coincidentally these happen to be the most played horde races for some reason.. 
---
Like undead racial is so good that an entire race with next to no pve merit is the most played on their faction.
---
This is gold
---
Honestly duelwield is pretty for warriors while leveling. I'd recommend you go 2hand arms the second you get a sufficient 2hander. 
---
What's a thieves blade? That item doesn't exist. Generally as a warrior your offhand should have high dps and  stats. The value between stat and dps is a bit hard to say though.
---
Bagnon 8.2
---
IMO, since you are behind the curve single is probably best. 
---
Go to a few AOE spots and see how bad they are camped. 
---
if they are not camped go for it.
---
Whatever you want really, but if you want fast exp and a farm build definitely go frost. Fire is satisfying with pyro crits tho.
---
What exactly is false in the video?
---
&gt; Game devs make really fun, addictive game
---
Yeah impossible for a game to be both fun and have subliminal messages. You seem quite offended. OR ARE YOU NOT!!!!
---
Urgh, Jokerd is why Mograine has terrible queues? Glad I abandoned it and moved to play with friends.
---
It's stock TukUI.

M4.
---
&gt; im pretty fucking sure this is debunked.
---
Well if you're "pretty fucking sure" then lets go with that. 
---
&gt; On top of that games like wow preffer other forms of manipulation
---
Im sure, and that's wrong as well.
---
Anyone smart enough. Which is like 1% of the playerbase.
---
TBC is more,likely , but the devs did say in a podcast with Tipsout and esfand that rhey are open to Classic+ if we want it. Cool bros
---
Like a leveling guild? Honestly most leveling guilds suck balls, just jump around until you find one I'd say.  And at 55+ start looking for a longterm guild that fits your level of dedication and interests.
---
Yer it's not like this post is some psa that's gonna change a chronic ninja looters point of view
---
I'm using it without any setup, what would you recommend setting up for a total noob?
---
the real question is, with the low drop rate of cruel barb, is it worth spending the time to farm another one or should you just be out questing to the point where they're irrelevant and you get better, higher level weapons?
---
Getting 35-50k exp an hour in a dungeon is way better than questing. I say this because if he is a mage he should be looking for aoe grips.
---
going holy at max, or prot. love healing, but didnt find priest in vanilla too entertaining and druids are Mana batteries D: . and thank you !
---
Why is it stupid? Are you taking things personal?
---
I am not trolling. If you want to show that this video is false in any way - please provide evidence of so. I don't care about being right but what the truth is.
---
if your not a tauren I am pretty sure its impossible to get another races mount at 40 since the runecloth turn in which is the only repeatable cloth turn in isn't available until lvl 50+
---
Yo the quest only gives 80 rep at level 54. Assume it will keep dropping by 20 each level form now on
---
Yeah that stuff is so addictive and dangerous.
---
You have to spend 20 or 30 mins farming up shards on top of any other consumables you might need. Also you are expected to be the first to the raid so you can summon. It just kinda feels bad and is a bit of a thankless job.
---
Warlocks are a lot of fun though. Aesthetically they are one of the better looking classes, subjectively speaking, and have great class fantasy. Also in pvp they are quite impressive.  I personally think it's worth the downsides but thought I should atleast give you a heads up!
---
I’m having trouble deciding between three classes, mage Druid and shaman and don’t have to time to roll each of them to 20 to get a feel for each of them. So I’m wondering if anyone can weigh in and give me some insight/advice into which one I should roll. I look the idea of being a hybrid class and being able to damage and heal, but mages also seem to be pretty handy and come with lots of utility. I’d also like to run a fair amount of BG’s when they’re released so what are each of these classes like in PvP? Thanks for any help.

i can't really answer the question, but if i had a friend i was playing with but on differing schedules, i'd probably roll a different toon to play while not with him.
---
Just self advertising streamer
---
I quit bfa 7 months ago so i don't think I will be going back.
---
I don’t think you know what a bot is.... I mean, if you think that’s a bot, then you probably think the auction house is the same as botting as well? 
---
Because the ideia is basically the same, you sell your items to other player, the addon just adds a little flavor and makes you set up your own shop instead, but if you have to stay there looking at your screen waiting for someone using the same addon to come and buy your shit so you can accept the trade... well I don’t really see this catching up

This is 100x worse than any charge your battery nonsense.

This video is straight up 2005 and I love it. You wrecked that fool!
---
As all things should be.
---
I think most/all of the goblin outpost have a special AH that is shared between factions unlike the normal one
---
There is something really relieving seeing you are on the larger side.of your server.
---
Well no, actually, cause she's not even in cat or bear form!
---
Macro pickpocket to all your stealth openers and leveling normally is just free added gold
---
Opt in for bc. See what kind of numbers that are going into it. Consolidate classic servers? Win win win?
---
4.3 million *characters.* That's including any alts who got scanned. Though it's missing anyone who didn't get seen by someone with this add-on.

Get a mouse with a numpad for most of your abilities. Back button for auto run.

My sex life revolves around the time a flight path takes and sounds a little like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU3Z4qb2n0o) but with less enthusiasm.

I think theres just agi +15, crusader, and fiery worth noting. Fiery not so much outside BG. Someone else might know more

At the time that I’m reading this, their upvotes are tied...

Is there any way to auto buy items from the AH without manually doing it? Basically want to buy mats under a certain price
---
This baby ass post. Grown men acting like 2 year olds. Jesus.

hard to read subs while playing -.-

Ayeeeeee. Kromcrush schquaddddd!

Single target fire.

Same. Seems really solid. Only has queues at night and it's usually not too bad.
---
Except for when my talents aren't put all into improving his abilities... he never successfully taunted a damn thing leveling in Westfall!
---
I wouldn’t call classic very noob friendly. It will make you work for some things and you definitely earn the gear most of the time. Retail is much better in that way. 
---
Classic is friendly enough but it’s about like playing a game on hard. Harder to do everything but more challenge isn’t a bad thing at all. It’ll just take you longer to do some things than it normally would in retail.
---
I’m sorry for everything my country has done to yours. Workers of the world unite.
---
Herod had a 5k queue on Friday night around 10 EST.
---
Idk what the blade was I thought that’s what it was called it’s just another green you get from DM

PepeLaugh he doesn't know

Ye boi
---
it makes sense, you are skinning their best friend
---
Same, fuck this guy.
---
Hey, my experience was the completely opposite of yours on Stalagg, level 43 btw. 
---
The difference is that my head data and your head data don’t matter to people who are actually attempting to discern these numbers.
---
&gt;	I'm quite sure it's like 45% Alliance to 65% Horde AT LEAST.
---
What is math?
---
I somehow always manage to finish quests too fast and end up under leveled, watching people 2-5 levels above me working on the same quests.
---
That's when I know it's grinding/dungeon time.
---
Team tilde represent!
---
Humor requires someone other than the person who made the thread to be laughing. Go watch more streams, kid is an awful insult and you should never try to interact with another human being if that’s the best you can do.

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME WHY POST THIS AGAIN HOLY SHIT GET A GRIP MAN
---
110% checks out bro
---
How late game? Whenever you're at the point where you aren't replacing weps every 5-10 levels
---
People trade in cities on retail too. Sorry you've fallen into the trap of convincing yourself they don't.
---
I’m in America and get that sometimes lol.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-BmKFgJJog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-BmKFgJJog) in a Nutshell, it's only 7 seconds long...
---
Yeh questing on Herod as Horde I would have thought it leaned Alliance. I'm not sure I trust these numbers.
---
Can I somehow see were I have to go on the map? 
---
Like in vanilla it isn’t automatically
---
Pre 55+ ish you can tank, dps or heal any dungeon with any spec as paladin. To heal, having a set of int gear is far more important than having talents in holy.
---
Are you telling me you believe this bullshit?....
---
The gullibility of people never ceases to amaze me.
---
Exactly, idk the lore much and I haven’t played very much Retail but if Chromie is still alive and could time travel somehow, it’d be cool if they showed a cinematic where she goes back in time to try to prevent the future but the time travel fails and splits her into two, and we now have Classic+ Chromie who made it back, and Retail Chromie who gets thrown back into Retail
---
there are only a very small number of pieces worth stressing over and repeating dungeons for - ravager, for instance, is hilariously strong and will last well into your 40s if you level by grinding dungeons
---
1000...
---
Congrats, you're the 1000th person to submit this in the last 9 hours!
---
Also it costs 10s
---
Well she’s clearly a bear already, she just didn’t want to be redundant.
---
Extreme gear dependency, you are a monster with optimal gear but without you're basically a meme
---
It’s not terrible. Due to how wow spells work you can compensate for some lag easily.
---
As soon as the server names were released, it was clear that Pagle was going to be Alliance-dominant and it's counterpart Mankrik would be Horde-dominant.
---
You need to click the server so it doesn’t put you in que for a realm you aren’t trying to play on and force you to wait 4 hours just to click a different realm afterwards
---
They scale like crazy with gear. Keep at it, things will get better.
---
The mushroom represents a mushroom
---
Worded a little strange, but you aren’t implying streamers are on Herod are you? Because it’s the non streamer server.
---
I have stacks of mats waiting to fill the AH and i’m a tailor, just need that pattern!
---
This is where some foresight of looking into Retail WoW population trends would have helped some people as I did.
---
RP PVP tends to keep a balanced faction make up because RP attracts alliance, pvp attracts horde (Emerald Dream) thus obvious choice was Grobbulus for a balanced faction makeup and discord polls and what not prior to server launch was showing this to be accurate.
---
PVP Servers attract mostly one sided faction imbalances of Alliance or Horde, with more horde per servers (Illidan, Tichondrius, Darkspear, Sargeras, Stormrage). They don't normally by themselves attract a faction balance. This means that the servers will probably remain horde-skewed until people try to make an "Alliance" pvp server.
---
RP Realms attract Alliance, Normal realms attract Alliance.
---
Keeping these things in mind because it looks like they're following the exact same trend as I expected would have helped a lot of people.
---
warriors are gear dependent. Without great gear you are subpar. with BIS gear, you are ahead of the pack.
---
Get a swing timer addon, and hamstring kite to exchange blows so you dont take unnecessary damage
---
Just reroll on a PvE server and seek some help for your issues.
---
Classic warrior *leveling* is dreadful. That's just a fact. They are wrecking balls of the highest order WHEN they have a pocket healer. Where they really take off is around lvl 30 or so. And at max level? Goodness lol. Think of it as a trial by fire. Take your lumps all the way to 60 and then laugh as you cut everyone and everything in half.
---
Torn between Shaman and Druid for my tauren alt, I don't mind healing raids and dungeons but I'm a reactive healer and not a proactive so I was never able to fully enjoy Druid on retail, does that mean I'll also have a bad time playing druid healer in Classic? 
---
Was sold on solo game as Druid over Shaman because I don't want to play another "autoattack and wait" like paladin/warr sort of is, and it's on a PvP server where cat/travel form are clutch, but I may very well end up becoming a raidlogger down the road so group play at 60 is what I'll focus on
---
Never said they did, but they want to and probably will if they finally get their nukes if you believe this guy:
---
https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1003332853525110784
---
The first point that I made completely disproves that a single scan is significantly different from having all the data that's available. It's called a measurement system analysis. Every broader normalization of the data that still does not deviate significantly from smaller sets means that the chance of a single, or multiple single scans being different than the whole data set is extremely low. This type of analysis is completely independent of what the actual data set consists of. If you don't believe this, then by the nature of these principles, you shouldn't believe any statistics of any data set.  Yes, there's always going to be some type of error, but we're not talking thousands of percent off. Maybe a couple hundred percent off which does not change the order of magnitude of the results.
---
Everybody that doesnt agrees with me is an idiot
---
there aren't a lot of classes that are very interesting in high end pve. mostly you just use the handful of abilities that are the most efficient use of your resources, over and over, and that's it
---
so rerolling probably won't be a great choice just because it's not like other classes are gonna be a ton more interesting
---
Keep yer FEET on the GROUND
---
Is it safe to AoE grind at 26 or better to wait till Ice Barrier?
---
You can get those spells from any trainer, but there are some, like water form, you only get through quests.
---
Please stop this madness
---
Wait who is the social justice white knight tard here now I'm confused, are you me?
---
The correct answer
---
Go to ShadowPanther.Net, look up his weapon progression list.
---
Problem with mining is I miss all the nodes because I always have "find herbs" on instead
---
Not while you're actually offline, but any length of time spent AFK with a new-tamed, unfed pet risks losing them.
---
Everyone else also grew up. You’ll never catch the tryhards, but I’m still mostly seeing low levels with the occasional 50+, classic is about taking your time so don’t get worked up about it
---
The Lich King was a metaphor for Activision all along.

---
Going to take me forever to ding 60 but I’m enjoying the ride.
---
He probably ran the dungeon with random groups pulling 2 mobs at a time, which is far slower then questing.

Thanks dude! That worked must have been an addon intefering with something

The rest of the guide is also a good learning tool!
---
Just Play, don't think about it too much. Believe me, it will be fun
---
I'm alliance on stalagg and it's a nightmare. Always outnumbered. Feels 70-30. I also think part of it is horde level better. Being in searing gorge or like feralas is a massacre. Basically have to guerrilla fight. It's not been fun at all. Not saying every fight has to be a fair fight but it's always a gang bang.
---
Questing if you have a plan.   Knowing what quests to skip which to do along with others, what areas to go to before others.   With use of bank alts, smart use of hearth and Just running a dungeon once with completing 5 or more quests in that one run.   I believe by far questing is faster.
---
Its ogar not agar... git gud
---
Blaumeux
---
... so we can avoid it right ? Shits look terrible lol
---
...
---
That's completely normal. In fact, I'd say you're above average.
---
It is because of the wind draft. All about the aerodynamics.
---
Thats a good idea. I just wish it was easier to organize dungeon trips in the mean time.
---
&gt;/cast [nomod,@amouseover,help,nodead]
---
You have '@amouseover' remove the 'a' in your command for it to be '@mouseover' and that should resolve your macro issue.
---
Man why are all of you guys hating on leveling a warrior? As long as you do dungeons you will get gear upgrades. As long as the dps on your weapon isn’t shit you should be fine. I’ve been having an absolute blast leveling my warrior.
---
Or only try to kill if you're over 10 levels under them
---
duel cruel then. But yeah your offhand doesn't account for much of your dps. Offhands only do half damage until you get the talent for it which ups it to 75%, so your offhand is not that important.
---
I understand how engineering can help a tank, but what are some ways it helps other classes in PvE?
---
God bless your wife
---
You’re not going to escape from professional players on high popularity realms. Also why does it matter that people stream?
---
I'd guess that no horde ran the census on Wyrmthalak, it's really unlikely that it would be that heavily skewed.
---
Noone plays in old zones anymore, except for some larger events, which are for lvl 80 only anyways. You can't actually find any groups for story dungeons and events are failing all the time. Plus your weapons are now fully skilled up. Also if you already have any lvl 80 you can use all your mounts, which feels kinda weird in old zones as they weren't made for those. 
---
It's still damn good game, but the leveling experience was something else the first time around thanks to the focus on exploration and how lively the world felt when everyone were doing the events.
---
Haven't seen a build like this online and I'm sure there's a reason for it, but I've had incredible success in heading this path. Figured I'd share. Once I hit 60 I'm obviously going to respec for sword and shield.
---
Well my conclusion probably comes from being in contested territories?  
---
Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, Alterac
---
The prot talents are wasted. Go arms fury. You don't need any prot talents to tank effectively. Extra dps and bloodcraze eventually will help more
---
Agreed. Shadowpanther.net. mainhand offhand mace sword daggers all of it listed by dps and in order of best to worst. Every single weapon for rogues on that list.
---
Idk why but that sentence got me teared up
---
Man, I can't wait until I can get the pvp mounts :'(
---
Yea the most I've seen the queue is 40 min. Usually it's 10-20 during peak.
---
The fall damage was lucky but still part of outplaying him.
---
use an imp instead of voidwalker in dungeons - the stamina aura buff is nice, its ranged attack will probably result in increased dps (and getting hit by mobs less), and it doesn't even have a taunt so it can't mess with the tank
---
in particularly in wailing caverns there are several times when you jump off of ledges or over gaps. dismiss your pet before you jump, otherwise it will take the long way by foot and probably drag some mobs with it. pet classes need to be very aware of their pet when jumping is involved for this reason
---
Luck also plays into this.  Maybe your drops have been shit, your economy kind if blah, etc.
---
But the grind is real.  I expect most people are in your position.
---
Yeah, queues are much better these days (jinx). :P

Also as an Audiophile newb what am I missing from plugging headphones directly into my computer VS an amp?
---
RIP to Stalagg Alliance, lot of my friends who are in the 30-40 level range are just rerolling on other servers because its completely impossible to quest in contested zones. Horde are camping Alliance to other servers lol. Hope they enjoy their 95% horde server in a couple month with no one to wpvp with.
---
I made this last yesterday at around 3:30. At the time I was about 30% to level 40 and only have 49g to my name.
---
I edited this picture a little by clipping the "9" from 49g to make it look like I had 99g. I also fixed the xp bar to look like I was closer than I was in actuality. I did this to reflect the state of anxiety that I was in while grinding yesterday. 
---
I'm happy to say, that with the help of my manatee form to farm crates in desolace and the plethora of beasts in the Badlands, I am now a proud boomkin riding on a Brown Kodo, and I am a little over halfway towards getting my Tribal spec.

---
Yeah, I hate the server but I’m giving it a go while my one RL friend playing is on it
---
I’m mostly thinking of it as a practice character until the dust fully settles on wow classic and I can make a very deliberate realm/character choice at a later time.
---
If I said something offensive I would be banned in seconds yes they are no lifers lol.
---
Works for me. Make sure you have the newest version, which wowinterface did not have when I initially downloaded it. I had to go to curse for the newest version that works with classic.
---
When I say
---
Yeah Warriors are literally worthless without heals, regardless of level. Alch, Cooking, and FA makes the leveling not that bad.
---
Also they are the most gear dependent class, which also hurts
---
It's not that bad, requires a bit more skill though but at 26 you have CoC so you should be fine. But it is difficult to have a place to aoe farm this "late". For horde you go to the hillsbrad farm with all the humanoids and aoe there until 28 then the mine just south. At 30-33 you go arathi farm.
---
The link isn’t loading for me what’s whitemane at?
---
I feel you it's probably fun. I do a weird split ret holy spec on my paladin that some people wtf at. But idk I wouldn't put any talents I n prot if I were you.
---
His minions aren’t actually dead though. Elementals can only be killed in their respective elemental planes
---
Kazzak has a leash, but the other world bosses don't!
---
They do seem to love to kill and imprison children.
---
Noggenfogger feels somewhat balanced at max level but seeing the chat from lower level players makes it seem that Alliance is heavily outnumbered in pretty much every zone making non-dungeon leveling a real pain outside of odd hours.  
---
I guess I'll have to sell all the good stuff to Horde through neutral AH at this rate.
---
If they are restricting shop access only, can you use VPN to buy game time and then play without it?
---
Not enough seats for the full thread, NEXT!

Western-&gt;eastern plague lands
---
Why is it that in the low 30s, every area with mobs my level (31-33) are being camped by alliance people levels 36+? I feel like I'm missing something
---
I'm sorry but warriors aren't even close to the highest armor.  Probably half of what has the highest armor rating which is Dire Bear form druid.  I understand what you are trying to say though.
---
Warriors scale in the end game, getting there is the tougher part.
---
What addon gives you that xp bar?
---
I also bind it to mmb. High five!
---
Druids can level slowly too, if you spend a bunch of time fucking around smelling the flowers or whatever
---
That happened to me in sm someone rolled a 98 and started opening it but I rolled a 100 after
---
Even the most populated servers have around 2K max level players or less. That's about average for a normal vanilla server, surprisingly. Will be interesting to see how many stick around and make it to max level in the coming months.
---
I would really love to see them open Outland for level 60 players at that point. They could re-tune Outland for level 60 players, and remake parts of the map since we won't have flying.
---
I'd like to see some of the TBC raids tuned to give players a challenge on the level or Heroic or Mythic level raids currently in retail.
---
To make it more understandable blizzard devs constantly said that no one wanted classic because we didn’t know what we really wanted, we only thought we did
---
Not even for the extra armor and defense at higher levels?
---
It's becoming increasingly apparent that you can level as holy or prot right now at launch because of how trivial it is to PuG groups.
---
This will no longer be an option once 99% of players are at endgame. At that point leveling becomes more of a solo questing experience and you'll be forced to go full Ret.
---
As opposed to Classic where they're just simply AFK?
---
Or just make a quality post
---
Pallys in organised PvP are absolutely insane the way they enable warriors with BoF and save casters from rogues with BoP is just crazy. All blessings are actually just insane.
---
A lot of people have been giving me shit for having a lion named Dog.
---
I'm like 42 with 60 g. Money is just easier to get later.
---
Except in lore, Stornwind alone outnumbers the entire horde.
---
What’s he wearing on his face?
---
added.
---
Vendor the leather and hides it won't up in price. But you are not really doing anything wrong, just keep leveling grind some gorillas in stv and you will have your mount eventually. Honestly there's no need to get it as soon as you ding.
---
Reported for account sharing.    Lol jk
---
What he's saying is that people won't be willing to spend until after that. So it's not a formed economy without enough willing buyers on the market
---
Bg's are cross server anyways, so if your only reason is bg queues you can reconsider that.
---
Yeah, I wish they went with an earlier patch version. 1.12 has so many easy things in compared to the vanilla launch version.
---
And its been shit for 15years, whats your point?
---
i didnt read this post but if a dude is telling trade or world "AVOID THIS GUY" it actually puts negative light on the player announcing it while everyone forgets who he was talking about.
---
Use general chat, trade chat or looking for group chat in one of the main cities. Or ask guildmates.
---
I just noticed the guild spam in chat and i feel like that really completes this picture lol
---
Heals weren’t fine at all. 
---
I’m not a big supporter of Paladin tanks, but this is pretty clearly the healers fault. 
---
Given pull size, healer should have been on greaters. When he wasn’t and the tank started to get chunked, he should have max rank flashed, pws into (dare I say inner focus’d) greater spam instead he spammed what looked to be downranked flash heals.
---
At the same time,  the hunter didn’t deploy a slow trap when it began to look bad, the mages stayed tunnel visioned on aoe and didn’t stop dps to cast a nova that wouldn’t instantly break. Esfand even backed up at the last instant in anticipation of utility being deployed.
---
I feel ya. I’m trying to study for my cpa right now and very limited time to play sucks!
---
That’s why I level a druid.  We don’t die.  Don’t see the spirit healer.  No subliminal messaging.
---
Warcraft problems require Warcraft solutions.
---
I've learned that it's best to just let the warlock manage their own health most of the time, because they're gonna be using what they have. They also have Drain Life to keep themselves topped and safe. Prioritize healing the group and then dump your mana into them as a last priority if it seems like the pump with it. 
---
Locks that don't bring their own sustain and expect the healer to top both their health and mana out of combat are really annoying.
---
Go to a major city and ask in lfg or trade or general. Seems like most people just use trade chat.
---
Being a healer you will have an easy time finding groups.
---
I don't even know how to feel about that. They did Classic amazingly well, it's lovely, and I wouldn't mind getting to TBC and WotLK #nochanges, it would be wicked to tank as Unholy, but I'm really not sure I would trust current Blizzard as a whole to not completely fuck up Classic+ the way they have retail.
---
Also I would make sure you got all the BRD quests done, Ony attunement, MC attunement. These chains give a lot of exp and you have to do them anyway. You might as well get the experience while it still counts. If you wait till 60 you only get gold. You can google the info on.where they start ect.
---
It applies to the Firelands other than the 40 man part
---
Naxx was first released in the inspiration for the “world” of Warcraft, a cardgame called hearthstone. The first adventure in the game, it only makes sense that WoW would offer homage to its ancestors by making the grand finale of its original iteration the first form of expansion to ever be created in hearthstone.
---
Tl dr , if you are a healer orepare to lose all your gear to boomkins
---
Guess your pets just hate you
---
I've bounced around to STV, Thousand Cuts' Shimmering Flats (but I hate it), Desolace, north of Tarren Mill (forgetting the mountain zone name), and Arathi Highlands. I was seeing it in ALL OF THEM last night except the Highlands, so I might try my luck there until I get into my mid-high 30's and can fight back better.
---
Gl tanking those dungeons without cons or holy shield, especially pugs that will attack different targets and wont wait for you to gain aggro 99% of the time. Completely useless in aoe groups aswell.
---
I'm not an expert, but Shamans, Warriors and Priests roll "need" on a  dps dagger?
---
Or how about mobs casting spells through hills and terrain. Sure -I- can’t cast spells through hills and trees, but the Bloodscalp douche bag can toss spears all he wants.
---
Lmfao, ok mate. I'm projecting my deep seated and flagrant respect for the terms of service for a 15 year old MMO. You caught me. I'm definitely the one that's wrong here.
---
I'm usually pretty nice, will heal and buff to save strangers lives. I don't think griefers need to be in my experience. Not while hearthing takes as long as it does. Seems needlessly cruel
---
Jesus Christ what is actually wrong with you?
---
I don’t get much time to play and have working on my character since launch and I’m only level 18. Playing a warrior solo isn’t easy. Got my rogue up to level 6 in about an hour, pissed me off how quick I leveled that one compared to my warrior.
---
Its classic, everyone gets wrecked by multiple mobs
---
I started my first char on Firemaw had to wait 4-5 hours in queue, so o said fuck it and changed to Gandling best decision ever! No time wasters.
---
Well its not sure. That's the worst part. If we knew for sure we could do that but since there hasn't been an official announcment I'm too afraid to risk it.
---
Don’t worry, it’ll be well worth it when you pass them. Recruiters from everywhere will be blowing up your inbox in LinkedIn.
---
Free Action Potion is gonna be SOOOOOOOOOOOO good when BGs come out!
---
Same. I used Current realm trends to figure out that it will probably maintain this as Emerald Dream is almost the only server with a similar faction balance and a PVP server. Every other PVP server is Horde mostly or only Horde or Only Alliance.
---
I mean... You don't needed It. :P
---
My point is that it's been like this for 15 years and Blizzard hasn't done anything to improve faction balances on servers so what makes you think they'll do something now..
---
I want to see gear I don't have yet.
---
what podcast was that?
---
Wasn’t it called Dreadmist?
---
is your gear up to date for your current level? i mean dont go too crazy with spending on gear but try to keep it reasonable. theres a reason why playing warrior sucks for making money. also repair bills.
---
I chose Shaman over Druid because if you want to pvp it's more interesting. You can dope around with Enhancement, which is great for countering ganks while leveling. You don't just auto attack and wait, you can weave Shocks (mouseover Earth Shock macro is clutch), Earthbind kite (get a swing timer), and Windfury procs are so satisfying. Then at 60 for raiding you have Resto, Enh pvp if you like, or my preference would be the 30/0/21 Elemental build. Big Chain Lightnings plus nice heals for your group's Warriors, and sufficient for 5man dungeons with a single gear set.
---
Leveling duo with my girlfriend, we're about halfway through 33 and play only on weekends, it's starting to feel slow, where should we level roughly? Just finished thousand needles as alliance
---
I don't recommend continuing to cultivate an attitude that seeks to find ways to dismiss opinions different than yours
---
Needing doesn't soulbind the item to you though. If everyone rolled Need, it would prevent 1 person Needing after everyone else had already Greeded.

I have been killed multiple times by a higher level horde while trying to fish :(

I don't believe so

Alaskan Pipeline time
---
Yeh it's just below chucknorris jokes in annoyance.
---
He never experienced vanilla so he's super happy to be playing Classic and wants to live up to the standards of "people were helpful and more social back then" so it sucked to see him so distraught when these kids were just out to get him after all the help he's offered people.
---
Or when it's a fishing quest and you dont have fishing.
---
gotcha.
---
it must have been an issue with the version i was being fed through Minion. downloaded and installed manually and it works!
---
According to that, Arugal is like 65/35 H:A
---
Fine by me. I look forward to the good bg queue times and will do what I need to in wpvp.
---
That's what ctrl-click does. Just click the name of the item
---
I'm a Horde player, though I also greatly prefer the 1-30 zones as Alliance. Leveling (especially earlier faction-specific zones) is such a small part of the overall experience, I would suggest playing whatever race appeals to you most. Classic is a long experience, spanning up to 2+ years if you milk it, majority of which is spent as a level 60 if you plan on experiencing all the end game content throughout each phase. You can always make an Alliance alt to play on occasion and experience the other zones.

Hexx rolls: 69

That interview is amazing
---
Yeah I never missed a raid and I was running around with only Might bracers and Drillborers Disk cause Biffer was getting everything.
---
I’d stay with your HD598s, adding a dac and amp will be an improvement. Cleaner fuller sound stage and really power your 598s
---
Mamnoon :)
---
Kromcrush representin.
---
Yea that watermark makes unwatchable
---
Hah.. because of your clarification, I smirked.
---
Alliance but I appreciate the response, 4 more levels then I guess haha
---
Good ideas all around. I appreciate it. I hope to hit these last few levels quick then. I’ve done some BRD runs but man I swear it takes longer than what’s worth for XP
---
No that's the purple version
---
People will think but not until Warsong Gulch is added. Hold onto it if you want to maximize the value or sell now for much less if you’re desperate for gold.
---
Could depend on your class and what rolls you play. If you're repairing a lot/ buying water a lot, it adds up. Are you doing quests, spamming dungeons, or pure grinding? Even though you make decent coin selling trash from dungeon spam/ grinding, quests rewards contribute a large chunk of your income pre-40.
---
I would recommend picking up fishing if you haven't. It's more lucrative than most gathering professions. I'd also recommend selling that leather/ hides. And even the herbs. Skinners are a dime a dozen, and with most people being around level 20-30, the light/ medium/ heavy leather market is going to be saturated for a long time. Better to get a mount faster than to hold out imo. If you are an herbalist, you can farm the mats to level your alchemy later, which will be much easier with your mount :P
---
You’re out of meowna!
---
Not everybody is a patient bear.
---
Leveling as a lock Stan just as important as everything else. Void walker is useless even with talents when your grinding fast so you are constantly being hit. Life tap sucks down the hp. I went a heavy Stam mix while leveling so I could take on 3-4 mobs without worrying about mana or hp.
---
I've rolled on 18 items in dungeons so far, 10 against the same person and lost them all. All my gear is crafted or from quests. Toolz, if you are out there, you are the luckiest MF alive.

He didn't make it up, that was a very common meme back when TBC came out.

I can't say if it's true, of course, but that doesn't mean he made it up.

As you approach 40 weapons will sell for nearly a gold, armor pieces for 20s. I'm de-ing the armor because I'm working enchanting still. You can sell them if you aren't.
---
Can we fet these posts removed? Every 3rd post ia this
---
It's so good that for fury dps warriors it's literally bis until the gloves from C'thun. Even for humans and orcs.
---
Yeah but it's a very different feeling. Retail you see people from other servers constantly, you may or may not be able to guild/trade with them. As if there were really a reason you needed to trade or guild with them because every piece of content can be seen via LFD tool. So it feels more like a pre-game lobby rather than being in a city.
---
Classic, you're really in that virtual world with the other players. There's really no comparison between the two.
---
For throwing bombs doing rotation pretty much. A sapper charge does 500 aoe damage instantly that is pretty huge for all the fights with multiple mobs, and when you are tryhard raiding you often have big clumps of mobs you just want to burst down really fast so relying solely on mages/warlock is poor practice.
---
There's also a mechanical chicken that gives a party buff of 5% atkspeed for melee and an dragonlin that puts a fire damage taken increase debuff on the target. Dragonling only rly viable in aq/naxx though since its fire but when it's used by a large part of the guild you have a sick buff to all the firemages for an entire minute. Rly huge for killing Cthun for example.
---
I get the part about the item hunt. That seems fun and makes sense. Main reason I dislike twinking is because low level PvP was so important to me when I leveled my first characters back in the day. We'd hang out in front of the warsong entrance and duell/shit talk while we waited in queue. After a while we'd move on and continue leveling. I made many friends back then.
---
After twinking became common and cross realm bgs happened that was gone. You can queue up for 10-19 but you'll only get instagibbed by twinks so you just keep doing quests and dungeons till maybe 39 where it's not that extreme anymore.
---
Had a work colleague who started in bc. It was his first mmo and after trying his first few bg's he said PvP wasn't for him. He got demolished by a bunch of rogue and hunter twinks.
---
They came in Wrath because people had been complaining since Vanilla that leveling was too slow.
---
So, vanilla enchanting doesn't have leg enchants. You have to collect Librams and mats to do Arcanums
---
These can be applied via the "will not be traded" area though

My xp/hr was really hurting doing full runs of BRD. Prison was phenomenal from 52-55, but at 56 I would go to LBRS. Should be able to get 50k xp/hr
---
This kinda makes me sad being Horde on Westfall. Might transfer if paid transfers become a thing.
---
Also scholo, strat, naxx, sm. Major dungeons late leveling / pre-60s
---
Use the medium leather to raise your leatherworking as high as you can (I recommend stopping when all medium leather recipes are green), AH the rest in stacks. Even if it's only slightly higher than what the vendor would give you for it, it's still a profit. Leatherworking can make good money, but most of it's potential to do so is in the endgame gear it can make.
---
AoE, imo. You'll do plenty of single target damage with an aoe spec, and having the tools for aoe lets you do it whenever you see an opportunity to (or do it in dungeons)
---
Same, not huge into PvP so having a play by play helps me understand what it going on lmao
---
Not sure why you were downvoted.  It's a damn challenge for a handful of developers to keep track of every quest in the game and their multitude of requirements.
---
If you do inevitably find a bug then the best thing you can do is make them aware of it.
---
It would last you all the way to level 60 no matter your class. On the other hand, as people prepare for P3 it could be with as much as half your epic mount.
---
Yeah lots of horde on whitemaine as well but haven't really had any griefers

After playing on a private server for a few years, arriving in Thunder Bluff to see insane crowds of people nearly brought a tear to my proud Tauren eye.

I hadn't considered that but in going to have to report her for cheating. The rest of us can't heal while in form. She has an unfair advantage, clearly.

Somebody is playing a night elf hunter. (yes, that's incredibly wrong)
---
That spawns in Badlands if I’m not mistaken... someone could’ve tamed it and had it hit negative happiness causing it to revert to its form before being tamed?
---
You are misinformed if you think this.  How much time have you spend researching this topic?
---
I don't think it's just the forced interactions from harder quests etc either, I think there are enough people that want to have nice interactions with people that they push for them given the chance.
---
In the last couple of weeks I've helped a number of people with quests that I either didn't have or had completed and have given away materials when asked if I had any to sell. I do it because it's a nice thing to do and I like the responses you get from people, plus it might encourage them to do similar to others in the future.
---
You have a tough start but you can tank in arms spec and as tank you get instant invites to dungeons which can provide good exp and the gears I’ll help you to be better solo too (I suggest atlas loot bc it both shows you loot tables of all dungeons and raids but also their level range)

Very easily. Mike Tyson at his best doesn't stand a chance against a slim kid with a big knife that REALLY wants him dead.
---
A big person against a small person is much less imbalanced when both wield lethal weapons. And an orcish skull would crack as easily as an egg shell when it comes to meeting the wrong end of a big two handed hammer coming at full swing.
---
Apart from this, there is magic, war machines, tamed bears and lions and all sorts of stuff that makes physical strenght irrelevant.
---
Also, Warcraft humans are pretty buff. Check the WC3 opening cinematic or the Pandaria one. Dudes look like bodybuilders and go toe to toe against raging orcs.
---
What UI is that?
---
I wish you the best in your support of a peaceful agenda! I hope you all find it soon.
---
Drop the party and riposte talents and pick up imp Sprint and cool down on evasion/Sprint. It helps a lot.
---
There's many many other factors at play than just sharding/cross realm. 
---
Arguably one of the biggest draws of Classic is that it feels like a living fantasy world that you're a part of, rather than just a loot game. 
---
Retail is fragmented across so many expansions. There's no cohesion to the story or its systems. In Classic, you are in the world from the moment you log in and nothing you see or do is irrelevant in the way things in Retail.
---
Scaling contributes to lessening the feeling of being in a world. Multiple difficulties of content effects this. 15 minute hearth. Flying mounts. The abundance of flight paths. Mailboxes and spirit healers under every rock and behind every tree. Profession trainers that teach you all of the professions. Learning skills automatically as you level without a trainer. 
---
And that is far from an exhaustive list of the differences.
---
Only if you are casting them as a high level correct? Regardless by the time your in your 40s you should be getting full spell coefficients

But ‘apparently’ they can all find those 2 distinct posts and not the duplicates.
---
What part is easier though? I have exactly 0 issues with desktop and can upload a screenshot just as fast as if I was on my phone.
---
I can not for the life of me choose between warrior an paladin. I know I want a plate wearing badass with a 2 hander. If I did warrior I would probably tank some to level but would focus on dps at 60. If I did a pally I would level hybrid and focus on healing at 60. 
---
I’m afraid to invest time into the paladin because I hear they only get more boring to level the closer you get to 60. I also hear that if you play paladin in pve you just have to heal. 
---
I’m afraid to invest time into the warrior because I know they are pretty darn hard to level. I know(as a mostly solo player) I will die frequently. Also the idea of stance dancing is intimidating to me, although it might be easier than I think. 
---
On top of all these, I will want to run around some bgs whenever they release. I know warriors can stomp in bgs if they get some heals but I don’t really know how ret pally compares . 
---
Thanks for reading through. Hopefully someone can help me decide.

Also hang out in a major city and listen for people requesting a healer on trade chat.

One of the first things I did in 2004 was bind autorun to a more accessible key. Anyone still hitting numlock for autorun in TYOOL 2019 is just not a very efficient person.
---
In my experience, any marking that isn't skull or X is just 'CC this mob.' If you have to CC more than one mob, the people doing the CC usually work it out. While questing I've been using square as 'sheep' and when marking in dungeons we tend to keep using that mark for 'sheep.' It's not a big deal because usually nobody else even HAS reliable CC, but I figure soon I'll swap out square for moon to avoid confusing too many people...

Where did you get this data ? Anything more detailed ? :)

You're an idiot, and "Palestinians" are lucky they haven't been kicked out of the land completely. Losing 7 wars - with foreign help - and constantly starting shit, yet Israel still gives them electricity, supplies and water. But some German nimrod such as yourself who lives thousands of miles away and who has never been there once pretends to know something.

---
If you are having aggro problems with your VW, just wait for him to get 2 taunts off on a mob before you start applying DoTs. His taunt adds a flat amount of threat each time, more like Sunder Armor than Taunt.
---
Like in terms of pseudo code? 
---
If you have a shield equipped and are in stance 1 or 2 (battle or defensive, respectively) /cast shield bash
---
If you don’t trigger the macro prior, but have a shield equipped: go to defensive stance 
---
If you don’t trigger the macro prior, but are in berserker stance (implies you do not have a shield equipped) /cast pummel
---
If you don’t trigger the macro prior, but have no shield equipped (and would be in battle or defensive) go to berserker.
---
When you place this on a bar that doesn’t change or put it on the same hot key on one that does, you can press 1-2 times and it will interrupt the target with the correct spell in the correct stance for the weapons you have equipped. 
---
As far as other conditionals for warrior macros, [combat], [nocombat], [stance:1/2/3]
---
I also recommend adding /dismount and /standup to all combat related macros just like /startattack
---
The semi colon basically breaks the command, then starts a new one (to be attempted to be executed after the one prior attempts) with the same /command, in this case /cast
---
/equipslot 16 &lt;item name&gt; 
---
/equipslot 17 &lt;item name&gt; 
---
For weapon swaps—good for insta swapping to shield from 2h.

Why specifically on an RP server? I picked one up for 30g and I'm on RPPvP.
---
all of ur auto attacks and abilities have a chance of triggering the blade storm which lasts 9 seconds. once you are blade storming you will be unable to move and start dealing weapon damage to every mob around you every 3 seconds (it doesn't consume or generate any rage). sometimes the hit of blade storm can trigger an additional blade storm and refresh the duration to 9 seconds again.

Don't forget the ganks! Warriors are the most succeptible to ganks from range classes. Can't tell how many times I'm fighting a mob and a lock walks by and dot me up and I die.
---
There a version of this for NA?
---
Yeah it's definitely worth having an upgrade for a few levels over a few hundred gold.
---
Omg! thank you!
---
What should I dual wield for a rouge? Dagger in main hand with a sword or what is recommended?
---
Y O U L A N D L U B E R S
---
Pretty sure that guy is saying time does not equal hard. If you take your time and are methodical, you really won’t die to same level mobs, period.
---
I had to do this on purpose to save for mount feelsbad.
---
My buddy and i dungeon and quest together. Our agreement is we split the gold on any high value drops.
---
Easy to co-exist when you're twice his level
---
Woo yeah, glad I chose Grobbulus! Fun server so far, though very few people actually RP.
---
no problem. 
---
/cast Sacrifice 
---
/cast Fear
---
I think it will use the most recent rank of either spell
---
Where does one find a ratio website like this for NA servers?
---
I would possibly narrow "learn to play your role" to learn how to play your class/spec. A frost mage is going to dps differently than a combat rogue, as will a feral druid tank differently than a prot warrior, and sometimes the way you play can vary wildly just based off your spec within the same class, arms vs fury warriors for example.
---
Don't use crappy macros
---
...that was my experience in vanilla. On a PvP server. Without friends. On a warrior.  
---
...not sure why or how I stuck with it, tbh
---
The irony.
---
That's a yikes lmao
---
I was born in a small farm town in the northeast US, but maybe I am from Eversong Woods. I belong in a community greater than any borders and walls.

I shouldnt focus on lvling anymore but on bis gear and attunements the rest will follow by its self

---
I bind auto run to the V key. Easy to get to, especially when I need to use the laptop.
---
I played a Hunter for 15 years, only making a change for Classic! I liked the customization of pets, the way the armors looked (armor wraps better on female characters by the way), and the general flow of leveling. Just be prepared for "Huntard" and "Hunter loot" jokes! Happy questing!
---
Is that Samson? The famous guy with the tame pet bear that does education?

That’s a fuckin money screenshot

Just use pages maybe? I use shift and scroll wheel to change between solo, group and pvp groups

---
That is how private servers did it. They will match premades with premades, trust me.
---
Whereas my Dwarf did the Wetlands run in the opposite direction to snag an owl. 
---
Gotta get that Screech going.
---
Tbh, I was a bit disappointed due to the sharding. I remember playing private servers in WOTLK where Orgrimmar was REALLY swarming with people.
---
Nevertheless, still 1000x better than retail.
---
Because they absolutely dominate end game. Obviously,  they need to weed out the players who arnt cut out for end game warrior. 
---
Maybe you could roll hunter?
---
The Old Blanchy numbers are pretty disappointing (Horde side). The level distribution is especially bad; the bell curve sits on the early 20s most of the time.
---
I would rather argue your point about "edgier cool races that are more appealing to the more hardcore mindset" - in that while it may seem "hardcore" to go toward the best min/max opportunities, the best players in the vanilla game tended to be the guys/girls who played a more difficult role.  
---
For instance, instead of rerolling because they maybe leveled their first character as a human warlock, they stuck with it and found ways to win even when placed at a serious disadvantage.  
---
Players today who intentionally accept such a handicap are far more "hardcore" when successful, in my personal opinion, as opposed to those who simply grind out success using racials as a crutch.  
---
While there is nothing wrong with either approach, you cannot claim to be "hardcore" when you always take the path of least resistance, no?
---
And if you or anyone from your friends has some ideas or topics you would like to read about, let us know.
---
Ahh I gotcha. I also didn’t mean my post to shit on you, but I definitely see how I was taken that way. I was more commenting that the fact that the two posts from the two people who tied on a roll are tied in karma. It amused me.
---
Fuck J. Allen Brack. He's a soulless corporate opportunist that ran retail into the ground and only hopped on the Classic bandwagon when he realized how easy it is to exploit nostalgia.
---
I'm really glad we have Classic and love it to pieces, but that dude is a giant turd that ruins Blizzard.
---
It's still all speculation.
---
Yeah that was wotlk.  I never actually played end game wotlk enhance but it was probably pretty cool like tbc
---
I'm a total noob, what are layers?

---
Is the Whirlwind Sword better for Human warriors because of the racial or is it still the axe ?
---
Naxx is out?
---
That would be awesome. Thanks for taking the time to write up a great response.
---
Yes because what you actually do is hold the item in your bank or on a bank alt. When they're all hitting 60 and want to level an alt, you put the item up then and sell it for way more than what it sells for right now. This is classic economy 101.
---
On the endgame end, stockpiling stuff for flasks etc is smart cause you can just sell it for way more in the coming months. I legit have a friend who's nearly 60 buying all sorts of mats off the AH just to resell down the road.
---

I remember this bug in Vanilla. Surprised its back.
---
I got it working by manually installing. I also have minion installing in the right place. Other admins from there are working 
---
Minion is feeding the wrong version I guess.
---
“Yea” WRONG ANSWER
---
What has really helped me is doing quests I’ve slightly overleveled. So I’m 32 now and have a whole list of green 28-29s I’m doing in Thousand Needles. 
---
If I can’t find any green zones I do a dungeon for a level and come back. It’s slightly less efficient but I’m missing way less and never dying so it’s way less frustrating for me.
---
A really interesting number is the population of the German PvE realm Lakeshire. A PvE realm with almost 28,000 Horde players and only 5,000 Alliance players! What?
---
We Stan baby
---
As a fellow rogue, you should try starting a group.  I never have to wait more than 15 to 20 min to fill up.
---
Been there done that. And as a former warrior player... the hurt is real man.
---
I'm still trying to find out, but last I heard this wasn't actually around during vanilla - I just don't remember if it started in TBC or not. :(
---
There was an addon that, if others also had it installed, would kind of work but it is no longer functioning.
---
Been there,  buffed that....
---
I think it’s best to wait til around 52 when you can get holy shield AND consecration. And tbh, before that it’s very hard to have both enough int and stam to not drink/zest between every pull. Int is the pally ranks demise.
---
I don't understand what you are trying to say? Maybe you should try writing it in all caps that looks more like your style.
---
"Preferably high pop" but doesn't want to have a queue... what you want is a perfect world... but let me just tell you, that doesn't exist.

---
It’s a very rare sword from my understanding and it’s a unique broadsword model, on retail it goes for a few hundred k.
---
How much fire resist do I need if I want to tank ragnaros?

---

---
I hate the dude too chromie just reminds me of the unveiling of classic and this phrase came to mind.
---
That is a lot of stuff that you definitely don't need to waste gold on lol.
---
There's no space for extra points in the build iirc
---
WoWhead class guides have a Professions section.
---
Rogue example: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-classic-wow#professions
---
Blizzard thinks that a ton of people are going to quit Classic within the next couple months, so for now they accepted more than normal numbers of people into each server but split them among different mini-servers (layers). Blizz recently confirmed that no server has more than 9 layers, so Grobbulus (which still has a queue every night) probably has more than 3 layers. If you get invited to a group from a friend who is on a different layer, then you get the opportunity to "switch" layers.
---
Fuck me, used the free character transfer to Heartstriker... pretty dead german realm. 
---
I hope they will add paid transfers. Atleast 50:50 horde to alliance ratio.
---
Gz
---
Only for the North American and Asian regions. Europe still doesn’t have a confirmed release date unfortunately.
---
What exactly is it that you told me again? You were the one arguing that there will never be census data, and the Reddit survey is Gospel. Now all of a sudden you're looking at the same census data I was looking at 2 days ago thinking its some kind of vindicating gotcha moment.  
---
To be clear, since reading comprehension doesn't seem to be a strength of yours, I never said pvp servers don't trend towards horde bias. I said until census data is established anybody making assertions about faction balance are simply guessing, which remains true. Feel free to scroll up and take it in through bite sized portions. I find it interesting that all of a sudden you find census data that supports your agenda, and it's now valid data, when before it was apparently some kind of joke.
---
The rng parry gods favoured you at the end there!
---
I mean if you go pally tank you 100% want to be spamming spellcleave groups as soon as you get consecration.

Any sub that runs with no moderation on ends up being 90% memes and satire. The subreddit just becomes a karma farm. Most people don't do intentionally, it's more like "everyone seemed to like that person's post with the cat in front of the monitor, I'll post mine too". Quality discussion and posts get buried among all the lazy 'entertaining' content, because as a browser of the subreddit, it's much less effort to scroll through see something funny and upvote than to read someone's question, observation, discussion, etc. I'm not saying it's black and white; that the subreddit should be 100% discussion only, but something more like 50% discussion-50% satire would be healthier. This subreddit right now is 90% satire and is turning into a karma farm. One of the best indicators of a sub going to shit is when you see posts getting highly upvoted where the subject is 'my wife/husband/gf/bf/dog/cat/daughter/son'
---
Aren't lower ranks more mana efficient?
---
I don't think that's correct. The best players at most sports or games in the world tend to make the most optimal decisions. Michael Jordan didn't put like weights in his shoes to be more hardcore or anything. The top DotA teams don't pick underpowered heroes so they can be more hardcore by taking a path of greater resistance.
---
People who are focused on winning make decisions that maximise their chances of winning. People who don't make those decisions aren't trying to win at all costs, they are focused on other things, like perhaps RP or enjoying the flavour or gameplay or whatever.
---
Ya, I've already done a bunch of quests through questie that I had never found otherwise. Mostly in major cities, how would I ever know there's a level 30 quest underground at the warlock trainer in SW for instance lol.
---
How did you even hit someone 7 levels higher? I only know it from certain guys in instances and 6 levels higher is already 50% parry/resist chance it seems like.
---
Yea stalagg I bet it was the same guy
---
Both can travel to Goldshire at 5/6. The NE also doesn't need to do the Menethil run. Look up the drowning strat outside of Menethil harbor, so you spawn in Dun Morogh.
---
Some useful info ive been spreadsheeting is that with a “average or better” group a single run of deadmines averages 15k xp if you just run it as most people do, if you pull every mob you net over 17k xp per run, I just did level 16-17 in a single run of deadmines. So if you can even do a run and a half of the dungeon per hour you can further increase your xp rate and wealth starting at 16.

My kitten likes to sleep on my lap while I play, while my old lady cat jumps up and paws at the characters on the screen.

---
That's a very serious stance to take. And while I support it, I hope it never comes to that for you.
---
As a rogue, when and why would I swap from combat to assassin or sub? I’m doing a lot of dmg compared to my groups at the moment but am kinda tired of the slice and dice melee gameplay. Didn’t know if there was a different spec or rotation that I should be aiming for if I’m not feeling combat. Unless combat is really just that much better overall.
---
I play hunter
---
I want it that way
---
Theres nothing hard about a class lacking the mechanics to be able to fight 2 characters. Its not from a lack of skill its from a lack of mechanics that would allow it actually happen.
---
Fighting 3 darks souls bosses at the exact same time is possible, just very difficult. Fighting 3 mobs at the same time is not, theres nothing skill can bridge if your class is horribly gimped.
---
Looks like going home wojak
---
I didn’t take it that way! Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify. It is pretty funny and I noticed that too. This is why I say y’all all the time!
---
Once I hit 60 I plan on respec to something more like 20/31/0 - which should be a balance of pve and PvP - or at least that’s what icy-veins tells me

Please, I'm vegan IRL and I have to roleplay a psychopathic cow that runs around slaughtering hundreds of animals that are just hanging out, then skinning their still warm bodies. When my kids see me play I just have to talk about how they're all evil mean make believe animals.

That quest was memorable precisely because of the problems you mentioned. If it was just an easy snorefest of a quest, would you even remember it? Wouldn't it just be like all the forgettable quests in bfa?
---
Can confirm, am Warrior. Also, since I hit 60 and respecced Prot I'm even more carebare stare about World PvP if my crew isn't with me.
---
Always loved tanking, always hated the helpless feeling of being a lone Prot Warrior.

Blizzard south made classic.  Blizzard North was David Brevik and the Diablo team.  Now Blizzard North team is called echtra games and they are making their own mmo called Torchlight Frontiers.

I feel this so much, trying to do all the pirate quests was absolute torture and it’s not a great run back. Like it’s not even about PvP skill, when there’s 10 horse vs like a group of 3.  But meh, it is what it is. Fairbanks myself
---
No recovering from that
---
This guy Hunters
---
Basically just a way to split servers up into multiple servers to increase server capacity and stability. There's a few layers per server and all they do is hide mobs and players from each other if they're on different layers, though chat and pretty much everything else ignores layers. There's no way of knowing what layer you're on but you can switch to a different one if you get somebody to invite you.
---
Nope.

This x100, there's SO many more horde in contested zones

You could meet up whenever you want. Biggest thing is if you go to a zone that doesn’t have the class trainers that could be painful.. Druid is an example.
---
You could get a summon or port to meet up or death runs.
---
Man I'm glad I chose alliance on Westfall good population overall and a ton of alliance. Makes grouping up way easier but no wonder why so many zones are packed.
---
They had us I'm the first half. I'm not gonna lie
---
Yes, yes, literally any (but might want to choose closest to SW or Org)
---
Did you even read what I wrote.  Even if it's a huge upgrade for you , you can have a big bag of gold AND use 10% of that on another weapon that will ALSO be a huge upgrade for you and still have 90% of that gold.

Yeah, there was two pivotal parries at the end. My defense is stacked (+gear as well) and most Prot wars know to dip into Arms for 5/5 Deflection. My Parry skill is sitting at ~12%
---
After studying the video I realize that in the future I shouldn't remain on the defensive after popping Shield Wall. I was still spamming Shield Block, when I should have moved to Battle or Zerker stance immediately and gone for the kill well before it got to those parries. The flat +75% mitigation from Wall doesn't care which stance you're in.

We’ll see how it goes. Maybe it’s just because I haven’t played in so long I don’t remember exactly what it was like. Only a bit longer until I get there. Thanks for the input. Happy leveling!
---
Same server, yes. Same faction, yes. That's the only way to transfer items from your main via mail. Race/ Class doesn't matter.
---
Some people like to give their bank alt enchanting so they can send their bank alt BoE greens from their main to disenchant and sell the mats. This does require leveling up your bank alt a bit to be able to train enchanting higher.

Neither is Molten Core and it's a high drop rate.

Wow, my server really is horde dominated, by a lot more than I expected, 65/35 is big time.
---
classic is all about lots of changes but also no changes when it means making the game easier
---
I feel like I know the answer, but you are talking about retail right?
---
Yeah living in a desert doesn't really make sense, but that's why they push into Ashenvale in Cata. They could be buying food from goblin cartels or similar avenues though. I'll suspend my disbelief though because fine details like zone size, population numbers, army sizes etc are never really portrayed. Blizzard kind of glosses over the fact that the Horde and Alliance have lost thousands upon thousands of soldiers to a world ending threat every 2 years but somehow they both still have hundreds more for us to slaughter during questing come next expansion. 
---
My point was more about how even with the reduced numbers, orcs and taurens are so physically superior that it makes up for numbers in combat. [This scene from the movie illustrates it pretty well.](https://youtu.be/YTcAy1j92-w) Blackhand literally picks up a horse by its throat, imagine how strong Tauren are when they are 2 or 3 feet bigger.
---
obviously players themselves can "do it on a whim," because simply joining a group with another player puts you in their layer. by design. for very obvious reasons. 
---
have you ever critically thought about anything in your entire life? or even attempted it?
---
except like 4 classes in this game theres not enough buttons to actually press lol. Go fight 3 enemies as a hunter in the level 45-52 range
---
Tanaris is normally always real bad because there are 3 quests to kill certain kind of wastewander people and the number of spawns is pretty low. And then you have 3 more quests that are in a closed off area that turns into hell if the factions choose to fight lol.
---
Only reason STV is talked about more is because most if not all players have to stop in STV for leveling if they like to quest.

What made you care enough to comment?

Well, based on the announcement trailer for classic, Chromie is the one that actually sent us back.

Ratios don't matter for a normal server. Only absolute numbers.

Well there you have it. Posts should be run past this guy to check if they're impressive enough. 🙄
---
Be sure you unzipped it into `_classic_\interface\addons`, then go into the char select screen, you should see an "addon" button bottom left. From that window you can see if the addon is active (should be if it's not outdated).

I'm not spending more than 10 minutes writing a thesis.
---
Can druid tank for raids? Yes, but it's more than likely you're going to off tank, or be a 2nd or 3rd tank. Depends on your guild. There are better tank options. They're excellent off tanks.
---
Druids take more damage, regardless of high health pool and armour. No parry, defensive stance, block. Without fear warding, your druid is dying to a fear since bad options to break fears in 30 sec intervals.
---
Druids can't drink when I'm near, less threat abilities. And loot tables are pretty bad.
---
Still, it's unlikely you're Min maxing the raid, but if you're in a guild with better tank options it's unlikely they'll want you as a main tank. Off tank, definitely.
---
In 5 man dungeons druid tank does fine.
---
Good luck with the sell, not sure what server you play on but on Fairbanks these sell for 40g so either save it until phase 2 or prepare to have much less than 160g. But who knows, I’m sure your server has a different market.
---
Phase two will be best around Xmas or New year time. First phase should be at least 4 Months for retention of normies or blizzard will experience huge sub loss from 60s camping the 50+ zones
---
How do you switch layers? Do you have to get an invite from someone else in the zone? Or can you get an invite from someone in a different zone?

Despite being horde on Kirtonos, I always feel outnumbered by the damn Alliance.

People will come up with lots of ways to stay online to not get kicked out and back in the que :D
---
My fav moment is when I went there as a fire mage, an hour later respec to frost and been in SM since.
---
How does the game decide who gets it in a case like this?
---
What I meant by linear quests was more the sense of... in retail, you turn up in a new town/village. Someone tells you "Go bring me X of these, kill Y of these, and do Z." and all 3 quests are conveniently in the same place. You go kill Y mobs whilst picking up X things on the floor and using your item to do Z and then you go back to the village to hand in all 3 quests, never to return to that area again. It just feels very designed to shuffle you through zones systematically so you experience every single area in as a separate experience. All that design ruins the immersion a bit.
---
On the contrary, I really hate it in classic when it's like "Go kill 5 harpies. Ok now go back to that same area and kill 7 different harpies. Ok great, now go back to the same area and kill the big harpy... you'll probably have to kill those same other harpies on the way."
---
BUT I do like it when it's like "Ok kill this enemy which is all over the barrens, and go take its carcass to this specific spot to lure bigger prey." and you've not just been shuffled somewhere, keep-your-arms-and-legs-within-the-car-at-al- times style.
---
I would also like to know.
---
It just does /who and catches whoever is online. Probably a good amount of bank/AH alts in that data.
---
I found it to be very difficult to figure out what order to look at the images
---
At least l’m not the only one who thinks this.
---
Did you extract it into your WoW\Interface\Addons folder?
---
If so, does the extracted folder have -master in it folder name? If it does, edit the folder name and remove -master. 
---
If not, is there a single folder inside the extracted folder, which may really be the addon folder?
---
 Sometimes, addon's are packaged strangely.
---

Sometimes people only need just a few.

Prot is totally fine for dungeon tanking. If you dont care about raiding or your guild isnt ready to raid yet you can easily play prot for quick dungeon groups until then.
---
Ret is viable. Youll have a harder time than a meta spec but you can still make it work.
---
Holy is the meta spec. This is your get into raid free card if you wanna go the easy route.
---
Every class has to pay to reroll. If a mage wants to run MC they probably want to go as frost even though they might prefer to do dungeons or open world content as fire. 
---
The way talent trees work you can make a hybrid spec but it wont top either role. No class can effectively be all 3 roles easily at once without paying the high respec costs. 
---
You should roll your class expecting to play one role (or 1 role pre-raid and then a different role after raids begin). You shouldnt really need to respec more than once/twice per raid teir.
---
Yes. I had undead in retail for that racial and went orc in classic for the fat stun resist.
---
Yeah, I've decided I'm going to play as a Warlock
---
Meanwhile i just dinged 30
---
Probably not while leveling. Plus it doesn't look as cool...
---
It’s also worth noting that as the average level of players increase, those unwanted items become unwanted by more people. Some might have value to alts, but with more people farming more higher content, many of those bad items won’t have any value again.
---
Death to America
---
Some items dont have a deposit fee if you sell them in singles so you dont lose money posting it
---
Noob question here. I'm a warlock. Should I be putting all my talent points in the same area (e.g. affliction)? Or some in each? And if I choose affliction, is there anything I can do to improve my demons or not really?
---
Yes, I too played a pally through all of vanilla. I didnt say they were the best raid tanks. Its widely known. Their aoe threat is unmatched. Consecration, holyshield, ret aura and righteous fury and nothing is ripping your threat. You don't even need taunt. Single target threat doeant really take any longer than a warrior to get threat. A fast 1 hander for seal of righteous is all you need. The damage doesnt matter, righteous fury does all the work.
---
Gear wise, its 5 man. What the hell gear do you even need? I literally used to tank 5 mans as holy/prot, heal tanking spamming myself with heals and keeping up consecration wearing holy gear. No cloth though, of course. Just a shield with good block value. Redoubt is op. 
---
For raids, sure, they suck. For all the reasons you listed. I completely agree. But people are so bad about letting the end game of wow effect what the lvling experience should be. The simple fact is that's just not the case. Just because a class is bad in BWL doesnt mean it's bad in fucking Zul'Farrak. Boomkins, shadow priests,  sure they are going to do half the damage as a mage in MC. Fine, who cares. At lvl 40? The damage is quite comparable. We all have to sit and drink nearly every pull anyway. Unless we are just going to be auto attacking/wanding!
---
I would recommend to create a new character and level with him, if you want to play together. 
---
An other option are care packs. Gear, potions, gold, bags..
---
If I'm trying to tame a new pet is the only way to do it to either abandon my current pet or to not have a pet equipped at all? There's no way to send my turtle back to the stable on the spot?
---
Add him to your friends list, that's what it's for :)
---
Keeping something bad in place because "that's the way it always was" is a fallacious appeal to tradition.

Right I meant more that they couldn't challenge the Alliance in terms of numbers. In WC3 orc troops are costly and superior to most of their counterparts from other races. A regular Alliance footman against a 10 foot tall minotaur is the difference between an average BJJ white belt and a jacked white belt with a catch wrestling background. 
---
Orcs are truly the best race.
---
Source?
---
Damn this is me. Decided to try classic after years of osrs / original rs and never playing wow. It’s awesome being a noob again honestly. I just hit 10 on my dwarf warrior
---
Generally speaking you focus on a specific tree because the talents at the bottom tend to be good. However, other talent trees do have some talents that are good or compliment well near the top.
---
Do a google search for classic warlock leveling spec and there are some guides on wowhead or icyviens that will show you where to spend the points.
---
I personally think the benefits of having that extra offensive boost while solo leveling/pvping far outweigh the benefits of those couple prot talents.
---
Even assuming the worst, 10 characters per server per person which is assuredly not true, it's still nearly half a million players.
---
Might want to go play retail if that's the plan.
---
It’s a very different experience from retail that’s for sure. Sometimes when I quest I will see alliance and I know they’re cool and we just do our thing. Last night I went balls deep in a cave in felwood and happened upon another warrior but alliance. He bowed to me so we continued and quested together, each one of us tagging a mob on a rotation and helping the other kill it. We even did an escort quest together. When a mage came by, he said he wanted to kill the war but I told him that he was cool and to let him be. A human priest came by shortly and I assume the war said the same. 
---
Other times it’s KOS though. And almost every time I hit a new quest and there is someone else there, we will group up for it and it’s amazing. Mages make me food for free (still tip tho). I’m nearly 60 and I am really looking forward to more that will come.
---
/r/badlifechoices
---
Yea that’s our trio, pretty crazy you remember us
---
Yeah I agree. I’m all for world PvP but it’s a little tedious when the horde pick fights 3-5 on 1. I tend to pull mobs into crevices in a hill or bushes or something.
---
15 years later.
---
I can definitely feel myself leaning more towards a paladin. Healing was my strongest in retail. Just want to ask though, if i am slightly above average skill level....can i still preform as a DPS while I lvl and at lvl 60s bgs?
---
Thanks again for the help.
---
It doesn't take much time to skin a mob. About 3 seconds. Over time that will add up, but in my opinion it's worth the time investment while leveling. I'll eventually drop it for engineering most likely. A stack of Heavy Leather vendors for 30 silver, but auctions for 40-45 silver per stack currently.
---
What this guy said ^ keep an eye out for horde once you get into ashenvale
---
How is it? I’m concerned because it’s literally 1/10th the population.
---
Thanks for the text in video, helps a lot when watching others play .
---
Ya np I get it. Just boils my blood thinking about that leech trying to pretend like he wasn't all "you think you do but you don't" 4 years earlier.

There's a big difference between fighting mobs that are a bit higher vs lower level - might be that.
---

You must visit the stable to put them away or abandon.

No, you have to go to the npc to put away your pet

“Look better” yeah ok
---
If it’s red, it’s dead. At least try to kill the alliance player.... For The Horde.
---
 Yeah, what’s up with that. I started out as Horde but rerolled Alliance  after a while, lvl 40 now. My realm has a lot more horde players. I hate  being the dominant faction. I always join the underdog team. I kill  every Horde on sight, if it’s red it’s dead, and don’t feel bad about  it, you deserve it when choosing to play on the overpopulated faction. I  will corpse camp you until you log out and start crying. I will  dedicate my gaming time    just to make your questing experience as  horde as shitty as possible.

That question is more or less - Should Blizzard get free money for paid transfers just because of what happens? Or should transfers be free in and out when faction imbalances happen?
---
Gameplay changes didn't fix this problem either. with this is they didn't do anything for this but change the alliance racials and it helped shortly in Cata, until all the PVP players moved back to Horde after some nerfs. It has snowballed into such a problem on Retail that Alliance participation in PVP + Raiding is to an almost non-competitive point.
---
Damn brother, im with you. Tho it is really not looking good for us come phage 2. We will be locked out in Ironforge or some shit :p
---
On Oldschool Runescape we use RSblacklist to report players who don't split or scam from people, the site then records all their usernames (RS you can double name change to get rid of a username) and evidence can be uploaded in images too
---
Makes it near impossible for knobheads to get groups for high level content or even applying to PvM clans since everyone knows about the site.

My man has never seen a troll. Lol
---
This isn't official data so my argument that it will never come still stands. But hey this is something other than the subreddit survey and it still shows the same thing I was saying so suck it I was right.
---
I know I'm gonna get downvoted but just wanted to tell you the word is smote! 
---
Have a good day buddy.
---
If you need something need it
---
While leveling I was regularly in the same group as a warlock, he accindelty  soulstoned himself so many times it eventually became an inside joke amongst us and the tank.
---
Everyone so far has been pretty casual in classic. It's been amazing.
---
A simple “Let me tell you a story, this is what you saw but this is what really happened” quick recon at the beginning of the cinematic wouldn’t be too crazy I think
---
Nobody likes world PvP anyway so good decision.
---
I'm thankful.
---
The main thing I disliked about private servers was the level of autism towards race combination min/maxing (i would regularly get spat on and abused over whisper on my choice of Night Elf warrior).
---
Winner takes all, if you need it you need it.
---
Agreed :)
---
*laughs in rogue every 2 mins and also paladin every 5 mins
---
It sells better. I tried it out with higher price for the single items - they still sold way faster than stacks.
---
What server you on?! I'm a priest and I need more warrior friends. I could help you level I'm barely ahead. LVL 25 on thunderfurry
---
I’ve heard that the actual number has several decimal places.
---
The shoeless hippies I’m always killing?
---
Both are fine, Druid better solo and much better getting dungeon groups.
---
I appreciate that you bring up that point, but it's more about the social interaction between us, we've played the leveling part in- and out.
---
General rule of thumb... same faction and server are required.
---
For horde make orc/troll as it’s closer to .Org.
---
For alliance make gnome/dwarf to get to IF fastest.
---
I’d recommend spending 30 minutes leveling to 5. Once in the city you can learn enchanting for 10 copper and you will then be able to disenchant any boe item in the game.
---
Go drain tank with dark pact to avoid drinking or excess life tapping. Immolate and Corruption everything. CoA if you think it’ll get more than 50% duration. Shadow bolt/Drain/Wand targets that need focused. 
---
You should be able to keep up dps wise doing this. I can answer some more questions if you have them.  
---
Do you have gear with shadow or spell damage? Shadoweave or Felcloth crafted for example?
---
i forget if attack power normalization is in yet, but its slow which means mainhand instant attacks, so warrior and rogue are really the only possible choices, warriors wont want it, twinks cant twink with it, this is a blue you might buy to lvl up with but never keep, 5g max maybe 10 imo.
---
Personally if it’s an upgrade for me, I’m rolling. It’s not my problem if you don’t win any loot, I will always run the dungeon again if I don’t get any. I’ll most likely be running it again either way.
---
Unfortunately, I don't have good headphones, I'm using some $30 Turtle Beach ones. I plan on getting the HyperX Cloud Alpha when I have the money (or more likely, for Christmas)
---
I have a macbook pro from 2010 or 11 that i used to play retail on just fine but something changed and now i get a notification that some part of my hardware isnt supported anymore when i try to run classic
---
Fair enough. AOE was good. Undead dungeons were an obvious treat. I just feel like i had to get lucky to be able to tank, even 5 mans. If they were desperate they’d send me out. But it was few and far between. Otherwise, it was all healing all the time.
---
Same!
---
Let’s go!!!!!!
---
Lmao i know exactly where this is! I sent the same screenshot to my discord server the other day
---
Why not? If I have friends on the opposite faction damn right we're teaming up.
---
It’s been detailed correctly, multiple times within this thread - to which you’ve replied with your absolutely incorrect assumptions and improper sourcing.

Forgive me for not having the desire to repeat that cycle again for you.
---
I open with cs&gt;ss (to 4 combo points)&gt;ks&gt;more ss then eviscerate as the is wears off, haven't had anything be alive to need to restealth after that. But if you need to vanish is how you would get back into stealth.

This is what I did and granted you won’t start hitting great strides of kicking ass until level 30. Pick up duelweilding weapons at level 10 this should help up your dps while questing. I don’t recommend going 2hander until level 28 or so. Make sure you have first aid to manage your uptime and you should only have to eat food after 2-3 pulls. As you level your warrior, your going to get gains incredibly fast and you’ll notice the differences too.
---
Level 28, dungeon RFK, has a really good 2hander that’ll help you pick up your ww axe. 
---
I also do zone hoping so that my level stays ahead of the quests as well. Try not to stay in one zone. If the quests our scale your level, start figuring out where to go next.
---
I wonder how accurate this is. The total population numbers for the super full realms like Herod and Faerlina are lower than some of the smaller realms by a significant margin, so there would be a lot less data collected for those realms I would think.
---
The Wetlands is quickly becoming one of my favorite zones. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all...
---
Ya I get that mages, warlocks and especially hunters have leveling easy mode enabled. It’s also comes down to end game viability and just the feeling of actually achieving each and every level. I’ve leveled mages and hunters but warriors have been by far the most rewarding class.
---
Not.
---
He might had been spamming charge the entire time too, in hopes of catching you before hitting the ground. Haven't made a warrior in classic yet, but I don't think you can charge while in midair.
---
I hope that classic's success makes them think about a change of direction with the next xpac for retail.
---
I... never said you were wrong. You are insufferable.
---
How do you get into a layer with a party if someone invs you? I got invited to parties all the time but I still see a shit ton of people where we wanna quest in so idk if layering still works for me in questing zones
---
I'm on pagle as alliance and kirtonas as horde.  Lol, imbalanced on both.
---
You’ll easily get 1k-5k for it in classic within the next 6 months or so.  Hold onto that beauty.
---
*laughs nervously in skullflame alliance*
---
Hey atleast we're not lakeshire
---
Ah, that makes sense.
---
kat iz 4 fite?

If you guys were really trying to pvp it out you would want a disc priest over a shadow priest, if that is the case you would want a rogue.
---
When an item says “chance on hit” what’s the actually chance on hit in %?

around 12:30 mark
---
I'm liking Netherwind - twice the pop of the smaller servers, but half the pop of the huge servers, and 52/48 balance.  Just right.
---
M+10 are harder than anything in classic and they aren't hard.  That's part of classic's charm though, nothing really requires player skill outside of pvp, so elitism doesn't take root.
---
The poop sock is for wiping, you animal!
---
It's still probably faster to just supplement him with gear and kill quests. Run him through a dungeon for the quests and drops, not the xp. Let him pick up all the grey loot to vendor for cash. The drop off in xp from having someone higher level with you is insane
---
right click. Also literally drag the attack button from your spellbook, you put the button to equip it on your bar, not attack
---
I got mine before lvl 2! First mob is pretty sweet tho
---
Are you a mage, warlock or priest?
---
Your keybinds gave me an aneurism.
---
Nah, sorry. The principle purpose of greed rolling an item remains the same regardless of the amount of money at stake.

Anywhere but a dungeon group id glady pay that, beats 40s fot 5.

Swords for leveling solo. Dagger if you're doing a lot of instancing/grouping/pvp for the constant back stabs.

---
I’m not even involved and I feel defeated for you.

Please no. Horizontal progression is key. Increasing the power level is a bad move.

Don't worry now the server does the lagging for that authentic experience.

It's gonna be an absolute shitshow when they try to go down to 1 layer.

It's an old green text or something

Huh? In vanilla anyone can need roll on anything, not that I agree with doing it for.money.

and a few fishing in that little pond too. Damn that hits right in the feels.

i thought that was just a troll by the NPC? Is that an actual thing?
---
So this is how you talk to short people?
---
They're both npcs, they're both being prevented from attacking by the same mechanic.
---
Totally agree. I am also appreciating finding people doing the same quests in each zone I level in, and 99% of those people are friendly and willing to party up and work together.
---
i submitted an in-game bug. But i have no idea how to write a ticket, due to just being sent into  FAQ on forum which gives me nothing.
---
Depends if you’re horde or alliance.

Why all greed instead of all need?
---
This sells for like 20g at most.

Classic wow head is correct
---
I'm extracting them to the correct folder, _classic_ ---&gt; interface -----&gt; AddOns.
---
I'm extracting them with 7zip, however the folders look the same in the addons folder as they did while I downloaded them. Maybe I extracted the folder itself instead of just the contents?
---
This was one thing I took for granted when I first played WoW. The game is hard and as a result you really feel rewarded for doing well. Improvements to your character make a real difference too. Modern MMOs, in my experience, really miss the mark here.
---
Does Asmongold have like 5k people at level 1 who just follow him around shooting fireworks off or something? Wouldn't be surprised.
---
Again with this.....
---
He's wrong. They are cross server in retail, not classic.
---
Nah, you guys just can't handle the basics of this game and want everything made easy and safe. Go play retail lmao.
---
go to the guy that taught you 225+, he will teach runecloth bandages

He’s got no life

no clue, seems the only spec is ret, cause fast leveling
---
well 300 is max so.. you dont
---
The Colonel is truly an inspiration to us all.
---
Where's my jeep stuff?
---
Wait what? Vanilla had battlegroups (e.g. groups of ~10 servers), not BGs connected across all servers.
---
It's just my opinion. I play alliance tho.
---
No I didnt. I know what he saying. It just is a stupid thing to say. OP isn't raiding. Why does a class's raid rep have anything to do with 5 mans. It's a completely asinine concept. It's like saying an F1car is better to get groceries in than a minivan because an F1 car is faster. The 2 have nothing to do with each other.
---
Very interesting data.  Obviously we can't tell how accurate it is, but the servers in general are much larger than I thought they'd be.  I hope the servers that are massively skewed towards one faction are just missing data for the other faction.  If the database is maintained properly it will become much more accurate over time.

In terms of HPM, not innately, no. They can scale well with +healing gear, though. Even without the good HPM, down-ranks can still be more efficient if they prevent over-healing.

As an alliance on zandalar tribe feeling pretty good about our balance, there are times where you feel outnumbered but there are still times where you see nothing but alliance crushing, future looks bright

I use a basic mouse with 2 side buttons and a middle. My key binds are as follows; q e r t f g ~ 1-6 F1-4 Mouse Button 3, mb4, mb5, control mb 3-5, shift mb3-5, control+shift mb3-5. This covers two full action bars. Have had no issues in 15 years of playing.

The difference is that demons are sentient creatures that already have names before you enslave them.  Animals are just animals, they don't have or need names until you give them one.
---
Yea it will be manageable but you will have I play on low setting
---
I only rolled Kirtonos to avoid the queues back during week 1. I only rolled Alliance because my irl friends only play Alliance. I'm lvl. 54 now, I can't reroll and I'm all out of no life time.  
---
Fuck.
---
Lol you don't have to do anything, I don't care. All I am saying is that, simply stating "this is crazy" is not an argument.
---
Yeah my evidence is right in the video. I think it's quite clear. Draw your own conclusions.
---
Its the latest epusode of ClassiCast beforebthe launch. They interview two devs from the Classic Dev team. Its on Youtube also on spotify, podcatchers etc
---
Not sure what your point is? 
---
Sure there's a segment of players that just blazes through everything but that's not how I do things.
---
Damn, you could've purchased a print screen key with all that money.
---
This only really happens because we level so slowly in Classic and people are doing quests they are under geared or under leveled for. If you took a different approach to the game and didn't attack anything that was more than 2 levels under your level, you would find the game almost as easy as retail (without heirlooms).
---
Where does the "likely 3 months" come from? I'm legitimately curious

Stv has been a nightmare, I hate the zerg mentality. I've found it's making random people easier to group up with tho, power in numbers and that, it's great because I'm doing normal quests with groups of 3 because of horde, and believe me they defo dont try attack as much.
---
Gotta be trolls idk how else to explain today and this post. These post stay up while every other post not this garbage gets deleted for low effort pure stupid.
---
I dunno, I get thanked just about every time I give food and water.
---
I appreciate you being the one guy to not call me names or insult me for having a different opinion. I think we're going to end up agreeing to disagree, but I like that you enjoy the existence of these sorts of things in classic, and I'm happy for you that you get to largely experience it again. If blizzard does change things towards my PoV, I hope you at least get your fill.
---
Rekt
---
Yeah I haven’t been running that many dungeons on classic. I tank on retail but tanking on classic is so different.
---
I just finished reading The Shattering yeeesteerdaay
---
I will leave you with this advice... it is spelled backpedal. Like pedaling backward. On a bicycle. Not like reversing a transaction.
---
Also backpedaling isn't a big deal for melee, frequently you need that little bit of position correction and don't want to look left and right to zig-zag back up. Sometimes mobs get twitchy and try to stand right on top of you, sometimes you want to take a step or half step backward to get the 3 things spread in front of you to consolidate their positioning some.
---
Your advice, like your spelling, isn't great.
---
Casters though? Yeah no reason for a caster to back up. Melee, and tanks specifically, definitely useful from time to time. Of course if you didn't realize this already then you're just regurgitating information without even knowing why or what it means. So here's some more advice I'll leave you with - don't do that.
---
No. So much no.
---
1. That mage didn't just walk on top of that brawl cage, they had to jump spam and shit. No equivalency to just walking out of the water.
---
2. Comparing fish mobs to Gadgetzan Guards is utterly fucking ridiculous.
---
3. If you're standing where guards physically cannot reach you, in a town, attacking players, you're blatantly exploiting guard AI. A player can't rely on evade glitching like a NPC can and **would** in this specific situation.
---
If you want to use daggers don’t bother going combat. Sub hemo spec for dagger leveling
---
My experience with pally drive by buffs is they expire before I can use them lol. It's the thought that counts I suppose....
---
Can't see this at work :( What does it say for Herod?? That I'm a fucking idiot for choosing it? Feels like population is heavily in Horde favor (I am horde)
---
What addon is giving you estimated value for sell/ DC / AH?
---
You're making weird illogical distinctions.  Either evading mobs is an exploit or it isn't it can be an exploit sometimes and not others based on the whims of a reddit poster.
---
Plz try to be consistent
---
&gt; back then
---
Right NOW on Faerlina Orgr is extremely laggy. In the evenings it somehow gets even laggier. Had to move my bank alt to TB, otherwise mail, AH etc were impossible. Takes 15 sec for an item from vendor to appear in your bags.
---
So the authentic experience lives on, no worries.
---
I know it's hard to believe, I was shocked as well.  From watching YouTube/streamers, I felt like there were a ton of people max level.  The number of level 60s is growing everyday, but as of a few days ago only 0.03% of online players on my faction &amp; server were level 60.
---
I've taken a week off for a vacation and I'm about to fly home. 32 holy priest.
---
I'm sat on about 15-20g. Skinning and enchanting.
---
What do I do to make sure I can hit my mount at 40?
---
My neckbeard private server guild did it non stop all the time and the mages in it had some of the best logs on the server. Lol.
---
Every time I visit the vendor, it's the same 9 plans available, am I just getting really unlucky? Has anyone actually managed to get enchanting formula from lohktos?
---
Tattoos can be artistic, for fun, to celebrate a memory, or anything at all because it's your body your decisions. 
---
Luckily in this case it's to commemorate a fond memory/appreciation of something that you love. Fuck the haters, looks rad dude
---
It will never happen lmao, other guilds will never happen. Unless majority of players are on those guilds like Asmongolds guild, even then Horde and Alliance guilds will still fuck them up.
---
Completely agree. Time in classic is what will distinguish people from being at the top because a lot of the mechanics behind classic involve investment of time. 
---
Retail has actual boss mechanics and has evolved to challenge the ever growing skill the player base has. Much like any other sport. Today’s athletes are much bigger, faster, stronger with the knowledge we have now in training them, than they were 50 years ago.
---
These videos were the best thing ever during my time playing BF3.
---
Ah "spell batching" is great idk why everyone here were crying when it was announced, oh wait reddit it's the place that tears are made.

---
They can roleplay the 300 movie
---
It's not even lumped into a private server thing. Even back in Vanilla, it was kind of unwise to equip an epic unless it was exactly your level and you'd get a huge use of it.
---
Oh man I love my realm, dreadmist. It is so good rightnow I see people we wave each other, sometimes I lick them. Even on quest noone interfere. It feels like there is a ceasefire for levelling. Let's see what happens next.
---
I think we should be making an exception to the BoE BiS items though.
---
Just use the twitch app. You shouldn't have to do anything but DL the add on.
---
renew is instant
---
That was how EQ was for a long time as well, level cap was hardly ever raised and your old BiS was still really good gear and new guilds had to almost work their way through the old content to gear up to face the newer content.
---
300 is max
---
I'd go so far as to say that chicanery like that could be fine and expected in contested zones even in pve servers, but a faction sneaking into controlled territory of the other should have limited ability to ruin low-level players times. Maybe even a pvp death from an opponent that has a skull (or however you say a non-visible level) refreshes your hearthstone and allows you to activate it while dead, so you can run to a different graveyard.
---
I think there's lots of room for being silly and performing practical jokes on other players, but as a paying customer I should have the ability to experience the game's content at a pace I'm comfortable with instead of being held to the whims of a few dickheads who get off on wasting other people's time. I think that had a place 15 years ago, but I'm hearing that the core players that came back are older now. They have jobs and families. They don't have all the time in the world anymore. There was a gilded post during the ddos weekend about how heartbreaking it was to lose that time. I don't see much of a difference between being griefed hard enough to lose a few hours and the server being ddos'd enough to cost you a few hours. Either way you don't get to play.
---
Yeah I plan to level it to 5 for enchanting
---
Will be doing this grind myself on my Gnome mage, don't know how I'll tolerate the mechastrider from 40-60.
---
It's more about if you trust the community. Classic+ should have polled content like OSRS
---
Your armor and weapon give you +heal and that works on all ranks.
---
6 phases over 2 years
---
Mage + layering xd. Dont worry it doesnt affect economy, guys
---
It doesn't matter if rolls happen simultaneously or not the chance of 2 people rolling the same number is 1%.
---
He isn't asking whatare the chances of both players rolling 99.  Plz don't try to talk to me if you're gonna drool on your keyboard.
---
You're wrong. Go back to school.
---
Thats what im trying to say, the guys that are wanting the GM's to do something about sounds like those Karens that want to talk to the manager lol
---
Because they might as well be NPCs on retail.
---
There's literally no reason to go out of your way to talk to anyone in Retail. You can do everything (pretty much) by yourself.
---
In Vanilla / Classic, that is not the case.
---
You actually have a reason to socialize with people.
---
There is no problem. You can’t just switch to any realm you want.
---
mike tythons kat iz thorny
---
No, there is no DR.  
---
It's just that as a shaman you have massive ap from Rockbiter and strength of earth, so 20 doesn't seem as big.  It's about 1.3 dps.
---
We Kromcrush the competition!
---
I do. I flew through the Barrens turning in a quest in Ratchet and was just shocked at the vitriol.
---
Thanks. I have been looking for good numbers.
---
It would be nice if Blizzard just would tell us. Hey this server has too many Horde so we recommend playing on a different server or playing Alliance here.
---
It's not a problem. They are dictating what low pop server your character from a high pop server can go to in order to adjust population issues and fix long queues. It's not a free transfer for wherever you want to go. Reroll time.
---
Create macro 
---
/4 LFM (instances of choice) Need (blankety blank) 
---
Spam the macro twice when it's out if the chat
---
Seconded for can't see it at work. Anyone willing to take a screencap for us?
---
Press V on your keyboard!
---
Autoshot?
---
I’m quite sure it’s the key “V.”
---
Okay you've *got* to be trolling right now. I'm done with your drivel.
---
That’s true. I would say Tauren or troll. Stay away from undead unless you want to pvp. Tauren also got a nice stun for mobs in dungeons and raids.
---
Friends. In vanilla I played with a real life friend and ever since it's always been with some variation of those same people I met through him. Imo that's the way to do it. Though if you dont have a friend playing to star out then that wont help lol.
---
Imo pick the class/race you think is the coolest. You spend too much time with the character to end up not liking it or regretting the decision.  Dont worry about "who is the best at X or Y" that stuff doesnt matter.
---
Should be v button on the keyboard or shift v.
---
Might be control v, sorry I’m not at my pc but I know it’s one of the three :)
---
I'm being just as greedy as the person that rolls need then doesn't equip it, which has happened 2x to me. =)
---
Yea but that’s not the *real* classic experience. I’d like to hear back from you once you get some dial up and windows xp. 
---
/s obviously
---
yes i know, i already mentioned that in my post how it allows me to get renew on every ally
---
still why would i downrank?
---
I get that different heal spells have different usage but i would never want to downrank
---
and i would want to stick to the normal Heal as much as possible, trying to avoid every other heal spell because Heal is just the most mana efficient
---
High rollers.
---
V
---
Thought I was replying to the comment to my comment. I are noob.
---
Still tons of people playing, even the low levels. It really depends what zone you're in tho.
---
Agreed.
---
What addon is that? 
---
I've been trying to get gathermate2 to work but the game alsays tells me it's outdated (and doesn't work after manual activation)
---
Go back to the_donald, we don't like your kind here. Isn't Sean Hannity on or something??
---
Ya, that's not how literally anything works on my server. If it's a BoE epic/Blue worth money, everyone needs. Why wouldn't we? That much gold is an upgrade to EVERYONE.
---
Lol I'm sorry you struggle with not letting your bias fuck up simple logic.  Bye
---
Not at all, servers are thriving. I’ve only been playing about 8 days.
---
Nice! thank you
---
You cant swap to any realm you want. The transfer feature was made specifically targeting overpopulated server transfers to under populated servers.
---
Pallies don't tank until they get consecration honestly. It should be rushed. Nothing in Prot is going to make or break you at low levels.
---
Right.
---
Ahh, the keepers of peace and justice in the Azeroth...until the dark times. Before the empire.
---
Every item varies. You can find sources like wowhead that has the stats or people who’ve done the research.
---
Its never late to start playing this game and you’ll still find lots of people in the starting areas
---
You are all legends.... was driving me mad. Thank you
---
skull first to kill
---
x second
---
green probably to keep under control but he should tell by who maybe a mage with poly or a warlock with fear or whatever
---
Would greatly appreciate it if you could share your settings!
---
Nice thank you. I'm playing Alliance so I'll go Gnome/Dwarf
---
Blaumeux here also 50/50. Thank god, BG queues are awful if you're in an overpopulated faction
---
Have you played the game before? 
---
Go to westfall right now and see how many level 9s you can kill. Gonna bet 90% of them are gonna have he gauntlet and not the sword when you mouse over them, because you’d have to be crazy or make a mistake to flag in your starting areas.
---
If they attack you it auto flags them, though.
---
My guess is they are going to press the reset button again.
---
Not at all. I’ve re rolled three times already.
---
Where should I even start? Is there a guide you’d rec? Or just kind of free-ball it?
---
People generally go for ubrs or lbrs(can't remember which) fire res buff, fire res pots and then pally aura/shammy totem. That should suffice
---
Those kinds of players unfortunately exist in classic too. You have BFA elitists and P server elitists. They're two sides of the same coin.
---
ok, but then that only applies to late game when the bonus heal an amount of your equipment starts to play a bigger role because so far i have not seen a single item with such a stat
---
I made an alt a few days ago, and the starting areas were definitely still thriving.
---
Meh... it’s a low level dungeon...  agi has some benefit it could be argued both ways.
---
of course not
---
people join months later and many people reroll new characters all the time.  You could join with Christmas and still have a great time, you just have to accept that other people will be further in their development, but that doesn't matter.
---
we need this sub
---
Shit its 2:1 ration Alliance:Horde for my PvE realm..
---
No wonder I cant find anyone to queue dungeons with...
---
It will vary a lot by server
---
You're welcome.
---
I went to stonetalon at 21 and basically couldn't do anything my level alone. The quests were in my level range but just too many damn mobs and no one around to help. I flew out of that place and abandoned every quest on the flight out lol.
---
big thonks
---
barrens chat in insendious =  /b/ in 4chan
---
Yup it’s epic, it used to sell for 10-20k on some servers. I found one on Shazzrah, just put up a post about it!
---
Oh right
---
Keep skinning, don’t level enchanting, vendor everything, only train skills you need = mount st 40.
---
You've got plenty of time. Lots of people are taking it slow, and plenty of others probably have had RL stuff come up; I've been off camping for a week, so haven't played at all. And time of people will level up alts, while others come play for the first time. Jump on in!
---
Are you saying that "battle-Groups" aren't cross-server? Because to me thats what they are. i even provided a source above here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo
---
Around the 12:30 mark they mention BG's will be in the battlegroups. which is cross- server, maybe not all servers, but cross-server nonetheless.
---
Mrglrglrglrglrgl! (Rages in murloc)
---
I got it to drop for me me when I played Vanilla back in the day.  It was the rarest pet drop at the time and everyone thought it was a regular bird until they looked it up.  Super congratulations on it.
---
You don't. I just wave at em
---
My friend plays like 2 hours a day and he’s 40 already...
---
Which is why I suggested asking questions instead of making assumptions, zoomer.
---
Only if you play alliance
---
How exactly did you do this? I have the same tv and would like to try
---
So then... 3 phases per year. Doesn't that make it 4 months per phase? What am i missing?
---
You are bravery lol
---
Guten Tag, wir haben Kekse!
---
Cool story bro
---
Turn on target of target. Only taunt when an enemy changes off you to something else.  Though some mobs have abilities they only use on pcs lower on threat table. Sunder.  Use demo shout for initial threat. Then sunder every mob, a couple sunders will be enough threat usually.  Mark the kill target for DPS to focus fire, and make sure you tell them to wait for you to build threat first.
---
I re-rolled on another server once I got to STV. It was literally unplayable.
---
Yeah I have another WoW one, link's here if you're interested:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA)
---
&gt;dude, your "argument" supports the addition of cross-realm BGs.
---
I like to see it as a tool to make people have incentive to reroll faction if blizzard adds a faction transfer along with it, so that if one pop server  is completely full with hordes that a large portion of them might want to actually reroll to be able to PvP in battlgrounds, and simultanously help relieve the faction imbalance.
---
And how is at an argument for cross-realm battlegrounds? When the entire point of it is world pvp, of course if everyone play on factions servers it won't matter at all if people want to play PvP in battlegrounds. If that is the point, then sure.
---
Faction is literally I don't want to Blizzard to promote, so I am not seeing you are coming from.
---
Also "ROTHSCHILD_GOON_1913", comon man.
---
Need some rage pots for that extra burst of rage in PvP and you’re good to go!
---
Just hit 42 and get deathcoil and stop being shit. You don't have to dot first, dear first if you can of course 
---
Or dot first I'd they're melee and before they get to you desthcoil into fears 
---
People even 6 levels higher then you will die into deathcoil ---&gt; dear with full dots ticking
---
Try to stick in there for a bit. At 60 the ratio is much closer to 50/50 PLUS we have one of the best wPvP on our side, GRIZZLY.
---
Phase 2 won't be as bad as it might seem if you can get to 60 before then and find some buddies to roll with. Notice how all of the pserver guilds roll Alliance, they prefer the challenge of rolling over mindless horde.
---
People did ALL the time back in the day and we are playing the same game.  We'll get there again.

Should be the same for every healer.

Added battle.net program to steam library. Run steam on pc and steam linl app on the tv.

I knew were were outnumbered as horde on pagle, but I didn’t think it was that bad lol
---
overhealing and mana waste
---
I rolled the dice on skeram hoping it would even out. Sad to see people bail. I'm horde and if we get server transfers I'd bounce, I prefer when its more even.
---
This is classic you can be whatever role you want to be!!!!!! Get that retail meta outta here!!!!
---
Wingblade from Wailing Caverns quest and Outlaw Sabre from BFD quest will last you a loooong time. Wingblade may get replaced by a higher level green but you get Sword of Omen and Vanquisher's Sword in your mid to late thirties and those are both insanely good. You'll use them until Thrash Blade at ~50 from Maraudon and then at 60 getting Dal'Rend's.

Hi, /u/Zeds_dead

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d49fzl/which_class_do_you_feel_would_best_synergize_with/). 
---
You didn’t suddenly discover something that everyone in the Classic wow world has actually been doing wrong for 15 years.
---
Whatever their reasoning works for me for now tbqh!
---
I would not have picked need just for the defense. You could easily just AH for a better cape if yours is really that bad.
---
How the fuck did you manage to quest through STV? I re-rolled because it was literally unplayable.
---
How viable is leatherworking for Rogues, and can elemental be a good alternative if I can buy devilsaur pieces at the AH?
---
i fucking hate it how I always say gz, but then I ding and no one says shit and 5 mins later someone else dings everyone says gz.
---
Holy shit. My server Blaumeux is  a 50/50 split. That’s awesome. 
---
I know this data isn’t concrete but wow I’m really happy about that.
---
They love having the most OP support class in the game.
---
can a phase shifted imp pull ads?
---
A macro like that is super bad you should cast them individually.
---
so explanation?
---
Is is normal for warrior to struggle with generating rage and threat in low level dungeons.  I was tanking WC last night at lvl 17 and felt like I was always starving for rage.
---
Addon your finger to number 1 and put frostbolt there. Done.
---
There are hundreds of free guides out there if you dont want to explore/figure it out as you go (no judgement) some ppl enjoy the exploration part of the game, some ppl (like me) want to rip to 60 asap.  I use Joana’s guide but it is paid (www.joanasworld.com) but it’s crazy comprehensive and class specific.  I think you can buy and get full refund within 2 months though otherwise just google search horde levelling guide, because honestly, Horde is the only way to go ;)
---
If you're unsure, just wait for the midpoint in those level ranges. At level 20 or so, Deadmines should be mostly yellow mobs, etc.
---
Some dungeons have pretty big level ranges, especially later on. It's better to be overleveled than underleveled (unless you're a healer)
---
At level 38 with even minor amounts of spellpowrr and int  gear it becomes a viable option, 4/5 lightning mastery and  new rank of lightning bolt.
---
At 40 you get elemental mastery and it makes chain lighting rediculously strong for the level range. You will easily top DPs charts in SM and RFD with CL and fire nova "spell cleave" as well of having the burst damage to kill anyone with ease.
---
At 44, you get access to a lot of spell damage gear and another new rank of chain lightning.
---
Currently at 48, just got a new rank of chain lightning and with 125 nature spell damage my lightning bolt hits on average for 425, and chain lightning crits for over 1k.
---
I've been using elemental mastery chain lightning to one shot 30's and rout alliance in hillsbrad and STV PvP raids, all the while having into gear to heal as is without needing to swap gear. 
---
I highly recommend any and all shamans swap to elemental. It's playing the game on easy mode and the only times I've died in PvP with a shield have been to 5v1's or accidentally aggroing the level 55 south shore guards.
---
I've tanked a couple runs in RFD so far while still topping meters just because of the free crit CL and fire nova totem making extremely short work of the packs.
---
While grinding, its far faster and getting a couple clear casts or crits makes it so you won't need to drink for 5-7 mobs your level. I.e. I was able to chain farm the hippogryphs nonstop for solid cash and xp doing the hinterlands long elegant feathers, and muisek quests. I was able to reliable pull 3 at a time and are them down within 15 seconds with a functional fire nova totem and CL crits.
---
Overall, I will say confidently switching to elemental at ~38/40 is the best decision any shaman can make.
---
Do talents like shadow mastery in the affliction tree affect shadow wand damage?
---
RIP. I guess it's cloth turn ins then.
---
"art"
---
I'm on a "High" server (Benediction) with a nearly 50/50 Horde Ally split. I've never had a queue since rerolling from Skeram two weeks ago.
---
But layering!
---
You need exalted with the faction to use their r11 mount.
---
so wait until the tank's hp drop a bit and just use the highest rank of Heal all the time?
---
bullies rofl
---
Okay so you're absolutely disturbed. I've never seen such anger and ignorance about vocabulary. I'm sorry somebody hurt you but you really need to check yourself. There ARE fucking other uses for the word and you will be laughed out of any group of informed individuals for this take.
---
I thought that was phase 4
---
Both arms and fury are fine for leveling. Just make sure to constantly update your weapon.
---
There is more than one  if you’re a human *black stallion*
---
I didn't say anything about the average level.  I was only looking at players online during peak hours.  But since you know for a fact it isn't 21, what is it then?  Please post your data &amp; source.
---
\-said no one ever
---
It's all starts what Class you want to play, which side to join and what Race. Then your journey begins.
---
probably dancing naked in goldshire with his female nightelf ;P
---
it's only a waste if you overheal. So I just wait until their hp drops some more to cast the highest rank of heal/greater heal i have
---
Asking the real questions here

Renew is useful because you can stop using mana. Your mana doesn't start to regenerate until 5 seconds after your last spell cast unless you're getting the bonus from meditation in the disc tree or spirit tap in the shadow tree. 
---
When you renew the tank, you can typically just sit there until the tank hits 20% health and cast a heal or greater heal to top him up. during that time you'll have regenerated any mana lost from the renew cast, and then some if you're still missing any from your previous pull. If you're constantly casting a spell to heal up your group, you'll never get your spirit mana regeneration to kick in. 
---
Down ranking spells actually reduces efficiency. The only use for it is if you're healing someone that is going to be overhealed. 
---
For example, if I'm in a group of DPS who have \~1100 HP, and I know that my heal will regenerate \~800 HP, I can either wait until they get below 30% health, and risk them getting killed, or cast a lower rank heal to top them up when they get to 60%HP.
---
You know that you can ask the first weapon trainer you find what the other trainers teach and they’ll tell you what city you’re looking for. Then you can ask a guard in the city where the local weaponmaster is and they’ll put a waypoint on your map.
---
PvP has different rules.  A lvl 20 can hit a 60.  Still doing lvl 20 damage though.
---
It's the world of warcraft not the world of end game
---
What leveling build would you recommend that would also help me out in PvP? With Faerlina being so full all the time it’s only safe in dungeons which I have no desire to grind out
---
Damn netherwind helm too.
---
I still have issues questing in westfall on one of my alts because the place is too busy.
---
sometimes that's just not possible due to how fast they are being hit. Heal cast time is 2.5sec plus any interrupts from aoe damage you take. Tank might well be dead if you wait until they're at 40% to cast your highest rank of heal
---
Noice

Ask in general for a party invite, swapping layers and avoiding the camper.

&gt;useless
---
Lol. Bestial Wrath, Viper Sting and Aimed Shot all fly in the face of this dumb comment. Hunters are fine even with the FD bug. They are some of the best pvp'ers throughout all of Classic, one bug isn't going to make them useless.
---
No, spell dmg gear or talents do not affect wands.
---
Imagine equating WoW dungeons to sports. Holy moly.
---
Epic Dingus!
---
What weapon are you using? Get WC staff quest reward or 2h sword from BFD last boss. In a few levels you can do RFK for corpsemaker
---
Using the smallest heal to accomplish restoring the amount of health needed is the most efficient. This is accomplished through plus healing and down ranking. Once you get to end game you’ll realize you have to be preventative rather than reactive when tank healing. Try using max rank and see if its mana efficient when your oom a minute into the fight

I'm glad you could use this moment to feel superior to a stranger on the internet.
---
Funny thing is, this imbalance will get worse if we transition to TBC.
---
In 1.12, where classic is, pet dps is all roughly the same within pet families. This means that all cats have the same dps - some achieve this by having faster speed but slightly lower base dmg, and some have slower speed but slightly higher base dmg. 
---
The speed is only important in pvp (to make enemy casters suffer more pushback) and possibly in raids, where higher speed means more chances to crit to fish for a talent proc (often you end up raiding with a wolf anyways though bc they won't die instantly and are still useful at range to howl and buff your melee classes).
---
TL;DR - pet attack speed isn't important in most situations. Pick up any pretty color of any dps pet family you like for now.
---
ok id like to remind everyone in the comments here that we were all noobs once to

And if you look closer.. the sock.

Warlocks can't use internals to harm others either. Get used to it, it's current day blizzard in charge here, got to coddle the babies.
---
Snarky and also really bad advice. Everything is dirt cheap right now because the economy is so weak, many things are worth far more than you can charge for them right now.

stacking agility for that hot wand spec priest
---
You should have greeded an allowed the rogue to have it. The +6 Agi is pretty much useless to you and would benefit the rogue much longer than the 2 additional stamina would benefit you. The piece was a much better fit for the rogue and you will find another piece with more stamina in the very near future.
---
Yeah retail had me absolutely fucked on my server for alliance
---
但是中文怎樣說啊？
---
You think you do but there are still server ques e weeks later totally dead on arrival
---
I was only looking for princess runs as a tank and this guy wanted a full run. He started flaming me for declining his party invite
---
Ive heard it's only a thing with certain unit addons. So shhh stop telling everyone
---
Ok there's a few things going on here...  
---
Ench/tailoring is fine, and a good combo.  Disenchanting quest rewards and some green drops is also fine, but I recommend against disenchanting **everything**.  As you said selling them is a good source of gold.  First grab an addon that shows vendor prices of items.  This will let you select quest rewards worth the most gold.  Next, check out loot tables for disenchanting, what level items turn into what materials.  Compare the cost you can sell item to vendor to the cost of buying it's disenchant mats on the AH.  This early in a server there are loads of cheap enchanting mats on the AH.  I have been able to sell almost all items to vendor and just buy mats on AH, this got my enchanting to 185 so far.  
---
It's a delicate balance, and a lot of info and little pieces to compare, feel free to ask any more questions if you need me to clarify something.  Also if you get blue quest rewards it's almost never worth it to disenchant since you'll get shards instead of dust or essence, which are nice late game for some enchants, but early ones are material hogs that slow down your skill ups in enchanting.
---
1 alliance 6 horde
---
I’ve seen your post history you’ve never even had a max level character in classic. You do what you want. Don’t down rank and see how endgame goes for you. Bet you will be wiping a lot of groups when you are oom
---
Stop telling people what the game should be to them
---
i would 100% recommend you switch before you waste more time
---
Now add for example 400+ healing from gear to all those ranks and see which is most mana efficient. Downranking is more or less only useful when you have lots of +healing, which im sure most of the guides youre talking about in your post states as well.
---
I need answer too
---
The whole game is a waste of time dude just earn money the way you want
---
Pazusu! You ungrateful gargoyle!
---
Guess you're that kind of orc.
---
Sounds alright to me, apparently you make most of it from 35-40 anyway.
---
Titan Panel
---
Stop with these fucking post we get it we all are subbed to this sub reddit, we seen it talk about it on the OP thread and fuck off.
---
Because Nightsabrs are life and Ram is uggh? :/ Also, best ram is Stormpike one and you cant get it yet anyway
---
&gt; dual wield 
---
1H Weapon Specialization is deep in the Prot tree, that's why I DW instead of using a 2H for soloing. 
---
As far as speed, don't get fooled it's much slower when soloing. The beauty of prot however is you never have to really worry. All day long you see memes and posts about 2H Arms pulling too many mobs and getting killed. You won't have this worry. At any point you can drop to D-stance and pull out the shield then just start spamming Shield Block + (Automatic) Revenges off of it. Couple this with a shield spike, and mobs will just shred themselves while you block everything. It's slow as fuck, but it's always a backup when you get in trouble.
---
When just questing or grinding solo I generally stay in B-Stance and DW while spamming sunder armor. It's only 12 rage and you can get 3-4 sunders on a mob *really* fast, and this actually helps you build rage faster as your DW white damage does way up. There was a really good top post in this subreddit the other day on the benefits of using Sunder instead of spamming Heroic Strike, and Prot spec plays right into this with cheaper sunders.
---
While grinding alone is slower, you're hardly ever alone. People that know you're Prot will remember you, and my /whispers never stop. *Hey man wanna come tank RFD for us?* etc constantly.
---
Autism is the sort thing people dont want to be so it makes for a good insult.
---
Urgh, now I want to reroll. I was told warlock was one of the least played classes. It also looks like the server I chose is only 25% horde!
---
Questie does this as well as recommend where to go next etc.
---
Hey same realm!
---
Once you're past level 10 generally you have to go back to the city to train. I don't know about an addon that tells you where things is sorry, I get lost on horde still. If you stick with it by the 2nd or 3rd time you have to visit the first aid trainer, or hunter trainer or mining trainer you definitely remember where they are!
---
Nah, that’s just what they want you to believe. It’s all about that goblin tech yo
---
And it comes with things you don’t need.
---
This ^
---
A lot of Alliance are sub-level 40 humans still questing Elwynn through STV
---
Did you make any changes to it? I use TukUI as well but my minimal is different for example. Can’t have my find minerals clean like that...
---
Don't run with him again.  Had the same issue with a human priest in ZF yesterday morning.  Guess who is on my ignore list now.
---
Nice dongus!
---
Ecks dee !!! Haha lol !! xDdd lol OMG hahahaha XD!!!! What a noob loooool xdxdxd
---
Yes...well...about that...I am levelling as exclusively Protection. Yes, I am that thick.
---
It's a spell in your spell book, not your pets. Technically it's a spell you cast, that gives your pet a buff, that means the next attack they land stuns the target.
---
I love paladins, blizzard doesn't. That's about it
---
&gt;The Wetlands is one such example, it's quite big but also not much levelling potential in the quests
---
Dude you're missing some quests then
---
Atleast it isnt the Black War Tiger :p
---
You are absolutely right...but i personally refused in my head to walk. I just couldnt do it anymore man.
---
You are absolutely right though, as i completely wasted 2 gaming sessions on this farm!
---
Thats 2 days of my time doing this :D Its up to you to decide if you want to do this or not.
---
Yeah i agree, can't trust them at all....
---
A bit late to the thread, but one thing to take note of is that a lot of these census results were taken before free transfers, so take it with a grain of salt. It will balance itself out in the long run, but it should really be reset after the free transfers dry up to give a better idea of what balance and pop is really like.
---
I feel like something the later iterations of this game lost is there there is a lot of game inbetween 1 and cap. Play how you want and have fun.
---
Horde vs alliance, but theres always the morons that find entertainment in 1 shooting low level players for hours on end, on both factions. If you dont get much time to play too, pve server is the way to go.
---
Normally I would, but it's unnecessary... I will remember his name for a very long time :)
---
4 strength 4 Stam leather belt?
---
And do you also just manually update it for new builds?
---
Join an RP-PvP server and relive the lore by creating your own story - maybe something like a kid who watched Uther ride by on his mount one day and aspired to become like him.
---
9hours and it’s still the top comment.
---
Literally unplayable !
---
Second this. Google Skarm, he streams and has YouTube videos. Really nice guy, currently a bear main tank raiding
---
You are likely just under being able to buy a mount at 40.  You may have to do some mob grinding for a few levels in late 30s, or whatever gathering profession you chose to make some money.
---
And I noticed one thing...
---
There's like 30 level 60's on the server my main's on.
---
I'd just stay honestly, you have more raid groups around in the future and who knows how many people will be playing in a couple months.
---
I play pretty much everyday, but since my time zone is est, I'm not entirely sure how it would work out. But I'm sure I could find some "stories" and write up an article or something about them.
---
That's actually amazing hahah. I leveled through Darkshore on two different alts (neither nelf lol), and had a grand time. Loch Modan was fairly deserted when I went there.
---
They'll remove the layers.
---
That’s so sweet 😩😩😩
---
Go straight to Western Plaguelands
---
I'm using the Tuk17 profile that's built into it, not the 18. I don't have any other UI addons. Everything you see is some option or customization slider I've made within Tuk.
---
It will specifically say spell. I’m pretty sure things like sinister strike are labeled as abilities.
---
Well, not yet
---
How about you let me worry about LOSing that caster instead, and allow me to tank it somewhere I can easily shield bash its casts, though?
---
Those aren't spells and no it doesnt work.
---
Heres a quick list for good levels.
---
Deadmines 20+
---
Wailing caverns 22+
---
Stockades 24+
---
Shadowfang 23+
---
Gnomer 31+
---
Sm graveyard 30+
---
Sm lib 34+
---
Sm arm/cath 37+
---
Yo sick mog cuz
---
Something’s telling me he can’t even feel his feet now- so sound advice.
---
theres maybe a discrepancy of around 1500 between the two for the servers I checked I might be remembering I got to find that census
---
Noob here, how do u know it’s 60?
---
These people aren't saying it doesn't work, they're asking how it works and presenting their own current understanding of it which is causing their confusion. If you're gonna try to explain it don't get all pissy when they don't immediately understand it.
---
AQ is like a year away though. He's going to be gone a month.
---
No, I'm using Tuk's launcher. He updates often and I like it (I *always* make a manual backup first however, because sometimes he makes changes I don't like and I'll mesh the two releases myself).
---
How does that mage have only 100 health?
---
It's normal to not have much gold at 30, you make much more the higher level you are. If you do want to get mount sometime while levelling tho, you should probably stop with enchanting. It's just a money sink until 60.
---
&gt;Reply
---
Alright, thanks
---
fair point, but you can freely switch targets after every finisher without losing dps
---
If i recall correctly it should just be in your book since it is a skill granted by a talent, you should not have to learn it.  It's not under pet tab though it's under beast talent tab whatever that's called (your skills).
---
A lot of data was recorded pre-xfers though.
---
Confirmed you’re a retard
---
That's how it usually is. Emerald Dream was the same, very few people RP'd and those that did stuck to their cliques.
---
A decent reply from a decent person.
---
Wow that’s incredible I just read that they are regarded as the eight most expensive animal in the world. Not sure how legit the source is but here’s the link: 
---
https://successstory.com/spendit/most-expensive-animals-in-the-world
---
Well I've been playing games in english since I was 10 :))) it helps xD
---
Cause the 420 has the original 8 add into it, so it only goes up by 8 because you only add 8
---
Cool. Now get the data for American servers where it actually matters.
---
Why should we give a fuck about what people do on private servers? They've already broken the rules by playing on private servers in the first place, so their opinion on tge matter is invalid.
---
Ive only ever heard bad things about grizzly from my guild, we started on alliance stalagg but moved to a new server the next day. One of the reasons was to not be on the same realm as grizzly
---
Is this one of the demonic children in Goldshire?
---
This just showcases warrior so perfectly. When the numbers just don't go on your favor lol. It was almost like watching a 22 warrior just barely killing a mob 1 lvl lower than him because of all the parries, dodges and misses.
---
If Barrons chat is notorious for being a cesspool, what area's chat is seen as the most well behaved?
---
17 is pretty low for WC. My guess is that you were missing a lot. Missed attacks = less rage
---
Have up
---
I would say “hey going for kbs when I can for spirit tap” and usually would get it when I needed to. Don’t usually need it but actively trying to last hit with wand/mind blast on every mob I could got me a lot of mana back in those early levels. Having 200% spirit and the extra 50% while casting for is no joke at level 20 or whatever, and you’re probably being a dps with sw:pain and wand anyway, unless the group is a hot mess. If you kb with mind blast you have 2 100% spirit ticks and up to 4 ticks at 200% of your spirit. Pretty sure that’s more regen than the 50/80 mana cost of mb.
---
So yeah, if I’m in a group as healer in shadow tree early on, there is no way I’m not going for kbs, unless I’m boring myself to death by only casting heals. 
---
Feel free to try it.
---
Yeah it’s been a great server so far on Horde at least. Everywhere is populated, friendly players, and pop up RP randomly in the cities.
---
What a piece of garbage, I like how this one sentence displays how stupid and scummy he is in one shot. Resto Druids are awesome, gladly have one in any group.
---
Basically the only way you can win as warrior
---
... wat?
---
Remember when they just had 4 American PvE servers, and then they announced 2 new PvE servers named "Westfall" and "Old Blanchy"?  Look at the faction populations on Westfall and Old Blanchy and imagine what Pagle must have looked like before that!
---
That's very kind of you. I will stick with pitying, though.
---
Wow that's nuts.  My server has so many people you can buy tier 1 and 2 enchanting mats for dirt cheap.  I just vendor shit and buy mats on AH lol.
---
Without dropping the profession?
---
Nah. Mages like int. You always have enough mana to get one kill at a time, but if things go sideways at all, you don't want to be oom. 
---
Gets a little more forgiving once you unlock mana gems and evocate, but it's still really easy to run out of mana in combat unless you've got a fair bit of int to give you that cushion.
---
The ranges vary bc of the factors the guide is basing the range on. Lvl 17 is the lowest lvl someone can do deadmines bc a lvl 16 wont be able to hit on the later mobs a lot. The reason other guides suggest 18 or 19 is due to the fact that you are able to consistently hit the lvl 20 mobs at the end of the dungeon. I'd stick with the middle of the pack with the guides if you find multiple answers
---
About 50 people beat you to it
---
Down syndrome works to. Little extreme for my taste but you can use it.
---
I'm on the same realm! I've noticed in the last few days that Ironforge is getting busier and busier! I think the number of layers is being reduced slowly, and people are shifting to IF from SW.
---
I wouldn't worry about it just yet.
---
Totally legit in BGs imo. It's a pvp event with no guards
---
I knew Skeram was really horde-sided based on how many times I've been unable to do quests because of ganking, but I never knew it was that bad. It just confirms my decision to reroll Horde, only downside is I've put 5 days played on my Warr and really don't know if I can stomach that again, I might just go Shaman instead and hope healing raids isn't depressing compared to DW Fury
---
Ironically the server my horde buddies went is Faerlina, which is the only non-Horde-dominated one they could've picked. Along with the bad queues it's hard to be excited to swap here but we'll see how it works out
---
Don't take this report 100%.
---
The app works using the /who command. So if there are several people using it on one faction, and only one or two using it on the other, it will get a more complete census of the faction with more people using the app.
---
If your experience playing on the server contradicts the app reports, go with your experience.
---
This is so cool i hope you guys continue to do this cuz i love it!
---
there's enough good swords just from dungeon quests to last you til 60. the only real equivalent to their stats are boe weapons.
---
in order - wingblade, outlaw sabre, sword of omen, vanquisher's sword, thrash blade. then the best free offhand to pair with thrash blade is mirah's song from a quest. these are the horde versions btw some of them have alliance versions with the same stats but with different name and model.
---
Of course man, if you have more questions my battletag is Madphyre#1237
---
I keep a full healing set in the bank. When I join a dungeon as a healer, I swap my sets first and then head to the dungeon. If I join as the tank or dps, I just keep my regular set on.  
---
Having a healing set is great because it greatly improves your healing ability by pumping up your mana pool, but you still have a shit ton of armor in Bear form and you still do perfectly fine dps in kitty form.
---
Counter spell
---
The OP said he was in a group, I can't recall if his post said they were about to run a dungeon.  Since he deleted his post, we both won't know for sure, but based on what I do remember, and what the OP has said in replys to posts in this thread, he was in a group running a dungeon.
---
In a group, regardless if they are running a dungeon or not, my argument still stands.
---
Imagine not grasping the concept of institutional knowledge
---
Dragonbait from The Cool Kids here. Is it just me or is this the only thing those gloves can roll. We must of seen four pairs of these mixed into our sea of caster necks. No sword and only two maces
---
Select mages I would say. I'm mage and haven't left a single dung. I would also comment if I would leave I probably have a busy life, which I would then tell the group sorry boys but i have to leave..case by case. Lol
---
Bro he's not proclaiming that the vets are wrong or that down ranking is a lie. He's saying he doesn't understand how it works and is giving his own understanding of it so that we can show him where he's wrong. Don't be so defensive.
---
Not possible by 40. Cant turn runecloth in til 50+. Even then its like 200 stacks
---
Got the pants too! =D

There goes my hero
---
I tank as much as I can but get burnt out with the constant rage starve due to dps laying pipe right off the bat
---
Full rotation is lightning bolt.
---
That's it.
---
It's your most efficient spell/mana.
---
If you have 3 more or mobs, CL and fire nova become with the mana cost for the aoe damage.
---
You are free to cast a shock or chain lightning on clearcast. Save elemental mastery for chain lightning as a free zero cost triple CL crit is an easy 2k damage.
---
Spam lightning bolt at targets until they have less HP than an average lightning bolt. Then melee them down with a 1h'er and flametounge. Flametounge is the best DPs as elemental because it scales with spell power and elemental devastation.
---
With a shield and spamming lb at range, you will take next to zero damage as most mobs will only get a few hits in before dying.
---
I suppose I figured most hardcore players prefer ignoring the challenge of other hardcore players in favor of picking on easy targets.
---
Both names are reportable under the Blizzard Rp server naming convention rules.
---
I think you misunderstand why people buy these.  Most of the time it's to flip them.  Find someone willing to sell for 8k, find someone willing to buy for 9k.  Items like this are an investment.  And yes, if you buy for too much, you may never make a profit and it ties up your gold for a while as you search for a buyer.  But this is how gold fortunes are made.
---
His final sentence is “I would never downrank any heal”

Do disenchanted mats tend to sell more than the vendor sale value of an item?
---
A lot of Mithril spots in the east side of Badlands in and around all the dragons and welps
---
The combat tables for hit dodge and parry are further scaled back from lvls 1-10. Something like lvl 2 is 20% normal misschance, lvl 6 is 60% normal dodge chance, etc until lvl 10+ is just using the regularly calculated combat tables
---
&gt;Why are mages acting like this in classic? 
---
They got spoiled by Retail and all the Mages I've met so far knew how to play just like the good old days.
---
I guess it depends what server you play on too. I still play with CC and just burst down one at the time. I haven't run into a bad mage yet.
---
Grats, any guides for leveling up to 60?
---
Gave me a very good feeling, gotta help each other out in this game haha
---
Did he ever apologise?
---
Oh you killed that mob before I casted, I'm just going to fire at this other mob you didnt want to aggro. 
---

---
Your Dearest, Searing Totem III.

Yes the glyph and it says "requires orgrimmar summoning circle"

Playing a non-healing class: pull slow, only one mob at a time if possible, get your first aid up and have bandages on deck, get your cooking up and have some food on you at all times
---
What exactly do you define as small queues on Herod? I had an hour wait to get in about 2 hours ago and if I try to queue during prime time, it's usually around 3 hours or maybe more. Better than they were but I wouldn't consider those small queues, unless other realms are longer?
---
Swifty is a manchild and only people who peaked in highschool can be entertained by him.
---
Can't answer your question because I'm new, but you have a threat meter? I thought there were no good threat meter ad-ons?
---
It might be the way layering works. More allies log in on eastern kingdoms then the layer fills up its higher ally. I bet kalimdor fills up higher horde
---
Hide!!
---
It's the other way around training is cheap and the mount is expensive.
---
Exactly! It seems impossible based on my math, but according to this video the alliance can do it? https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=28uB4ym6TCM
---
Juicylucy there on the bottom right corner
---
Where in Undercity is this?
---
Engineering is the only profession where you need the profession to use what you craft. You can get all the benefits from other professions without having them. There are few exceptions, eg. Tailoring robes that are very good. But there's better gear from raids in the long run. Engineering is the only actual DPS upgrade that'll last.
---
30? Look at you Mr. no-lifer! I just hit 23!
---
Pvp frames detected
---
He’s level 60 under the character portrait and he’s leveling up, so it’s only possible that this was taken as he was dinging 60
---
So I hit lvl 39 last night and am unsure were to be as alliance, should I hit up dustwallow till 40 then go to feralas/other zones intended for 40+
---
Totally and it's not hard to see why. Racists have an incentive to report everything they can to make common decency seem intrusive.
---
So beautiful
---
Sure it does. Don't be a boring billy.
---
Mid 30s now and faction balance has been quite good but not great. STV is quite harsh and I've desolace is even worse. But Alliance have a hold on a few spots. Still Ashbringer looks really tempting for the Free Transfer. Don't know if I should just go ahead and take it.
---
People who buy something like this do it just because they can. Same reason why people buy gold toilet seats. Might seem dumb to someone who doesn't have that much gold and can't afford it, sure.
---
Normalisation affects the AP part of the formula, Base damage for slow weapon is still higher. But yea, it’s not as bad as pre 1.8 like with the barman shanker.
---
Ahh thanks for the clarification
---
I'm guessing that people on PvP servers are focusing on leveling to 60 quickly, whereas people on PvE servers are being more casual and making more alts early.  So I speculate that a PvP server will have fewer characters than a PvE server with as many players.
---
As summoned.

You could make more than 8g/hr farming jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows and vendoring all the greys/greens. Even more if you have herbalism, to get all the fadeleaf/blindweed.

I've actually began playing rogue in classic which I haven't done before in retail and it's a blast. Meanwhile I really can't have fun playing Paladin like I did in retail.

"I'm going to just state my opinion with no actual proof or evidence of it being fact and then act as if someones post history means anything in this current argument" You're literally a cancer to the world. You don't know how to justify what you're saying, and you don't actually understand it yourself. You're just spewing whatever garbage you read from someone else. The fact is, a higher rank healing spell in terms of mana:healing is always more efficient than a lower ranked one. That is a statistical fact. Now the OP is asking why he shouldn't just wait until high highest ranked healing spell won't overheal instead of downranking, and there is no reason why he shouldn't early on. You're better off to let your tank hit 10%HP and use a greater heal to get him to 80% HP than to use a rank 4 heal at 70% with no other factors being involved. 
---
Now if you weren't such a dipshit and actually understood the reason why people would downrank, you would explain that some fights, for example the golem fuck in Uldaman as the first time someone might experience a real mechanic, will lock you out of spellcasting. So if you wait until it's too late, you won't be able to do anything about the tanks death. Or in a really shitty scenario, you could even get feared in the stockades, or get stunned with an add still up on Smite in the deadmines, and the tank would be dead before you could heal him up.
---
The normalization isn't on weapon damage, just on the attack power damage bonus. Just wanted to clarify for anyone reading.  
---
A 2.7 speed with a damage range of 50-100 will hit for the exact same as a 1.8 speed with damage of 50-100 on an instant attack, however the 2.7 speed will hit harder on non instant attacks because the damage bonus from attack power is scaled up for a slower weapon.
---
Not saying you didn't know, just want clear in your post :)
---
Even if they managed to get it, just wait til later when you can turn runecloth in
---
I couldn’t agree more. There’s a reason why every triple-A game has a cosmetics shop. I can’t say it’s something I’m fond of. But there’s definitely a market for pets and anything that modifies the appearance of ones character in game.
---
Yeah because he doesn't understand how to do so effectively.
---
Warriors are probably the most gear dependent class iirc
---
It's characters. It uses the /who command.
---
Also don't try this with warriors thinking you'll come up with an amazing Thunderclap Warrior spec.  
---
...it doesn't work
---
39 in 40+ zones can be a bit rough. Probably not many quests and mob level range can screw you over. Do you have any elite quests in any of the 30-40 zones? Like stromgarde or crushridge?
---
I couldn't disagree more. Gold is much harder to come by than a new weapon. I'm a 52 rogue and I definitely had times of needing a new weapon, but even if I got a current level blue to drop, I'd rather sell it. I had to do a lot of AH flipping in order to afford my mount in time. My mount has increased my leveling speed drastically more than a blue weapon upgrade. And if a blue twin weapon dropped, I'd definitely hold on to it to sell it later for an easy epic mount or easy raid consumables.
---
Guild consumes come and go... But a super rare pet is super rare. I'd keep it

Seriously, I'm coming from one of the most democratic countries in the world (Switzerland), yet I find myself having more in common with you than with so many of my "fellow countrymen".

 i just accepted it. If you dont use your second application in fullscreen i.e. just make the window a little smaller it won't happen. i experiemented a little more and for me its happening for all windows fullscreen games not only wow... i even reinstalled windows with full format, no luck either so i guess its a driver / hardware issue
---
Parsec
---
It works great
---
my autorunning has never went right
---
I'm sooooo happy I graduated at the beginning of summer so I don't have to study right now
---
make friends with tanks. warriors druids and (some) paladins can fill this role and they like knowing good healers to run with.
---
note that most of these classes do not want to tank even though theyre able to. 
---
and as mentioned its easiest to form a group in a major city.
---
The most cancerous thing in Classic right now are these princess run and GY run spams. No wonder he’s upset. It’s hard enough finding people for full runs.
---
BGs will be battlegroups buddy boy.  If you're playing horde expect a long que no matter what.
---
FD and drink isnt a thing anymore?
---
Every class has issues lol. I loved raiding and pvping on a hunter, let alone soloable content that no other class could solo. There is more to WoW than raiding, and if you dont like it and want to raid, roll another class then. Or play retail, I hear your issues are non existent now.
---
You missed the point and the argument fails any way.
---
WoW absolutely **was** aimed at "casuals" relative to mmo players of that time.
---
Back then, MMOs were extremely niche and for hardcore people mostly. WoW changed that as it was absolutely targeting casuals as well.
---
The "casual" mmo player *then* most likely isn't the casual mmo player from back then.
---
Because a lot of people don't need the full stack but only 4 of the item buying more is easy buying less is hard if you only sell a stack.
---
Nobody could do anything. Ally death squads of 10+ people levels 30-45 ganking everyone. They also had a 60 at one point. They must have been really bored. There were plenty of Horde in TM to make it fun too, but theyd rather hang in the chat calling people whiners than participate in pvp.
---
Thanks :)
---
You're past the point where skinning was helpful. It's about 20-25g from vendoring skins while leveling 1-40
---
The first 40 man raid was cleared in the first week with 30 people, half of which were in their 50s.
---
Play what you like, it really doesn't matter
---
The truth is I want to participate in low lvl bgs, do them to relax from questing
---
Thanks man :) You are awesome
---
Yeah it’s kinda beat but I don’t mind it. I’m 95% a pker on the game. They just passed the best wilderness update in history though. &amp; Even as a pker the game is playable because nothing changes. But when things do it’s generally a really good change
---
some talents are additive, some are multiplicative.
---
15% bonus threat isnt much when youre wearing greens but 5% crit is always 5% crit.
---
I bet both of them had 500g less than op.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I tried to get into it, but my friends who tried to start me were all 30-40 and 16 year old me wasn't having any fun alone. I never even stuck around for TBC.
---
Last night I caved and started my subscription for classic. Even without any friends I had more fun getting my druid to level 6 than I've had playing any game this year! People talking, dueling, grouping, etc. I saved a distracted player with a well timed HoT, partied with a warrior to knock out the starting cave quest in two minutes, and /waved and /trained my way around with anyone willing to emote back.
---
If this is what I missed, I'm so glad I got a second chance.
---
In practice, plenty of people will refuse to take certain classes into dungeons. I've seen it plenty.
---
Auctioneer is pretty good at the moment.
---
I started with TSM which I use on retail but I have heard not so great things about it
---
Because pvp is pointless until the honor system comes in.
---
Finished those already but I need the elite av quests
---
Hey mom I lied on the internet for points, am I cool enough for dad to come home yet ?
---
Cries in macro.
---
I use elvui but atm predictice healing isnt working so i have to use luna for unit frames
---
no they dont really 
---
&gt;As a practical example, let's take the most effective Priest heal: the Greater Heal ability. It costs 710 mana to cast at level 60, which makes it an expensive, but effective heal. However, lower ranks of the spell will have the same cast time, without the hefty mana cost. In this instance, you could theoretically use Rank 1 of this spell for steady, relatively cheap healing. Then you can use Rank 3 for moderate healing and reserve Rank 5 for the most intensive healing.
---
Come on in! The water's fine!
---
Well, we've really just started and we're two from same guild, but I suppose we could coordinate with you through discord. plus we've just set up a trello board to gather topics/ideas for next issue.
---
I suppose if you are able to use discord, I could send you invite to our server and we could follow up there. And perhaps we could ask our GM to make us a dedicated channel there so we wouldn't have to rely on PMs.
---
Correct. Blizzard did a good job giving us a reason to have our main stat rather than AP. So it's like AP is there as a way to not feel terrible of you arent able to get your main stat.
---
I always tried to convince my friends to roll paladins. So we could roll in a squad 5 deep. Think of all the auras! All the buffs! All the heals!
---
So you just sit there and let yourself and your groupmate get killed because "its pointless" sounds like cowardice
---
I read this while taking a redundant shit.
---
Good to know you're doing Mythic Raiding by yourself. Would you teach me how it is done?
---
Not everyone wants to be a tauren or nelf.
---
Is it worth downranking lightning bolt at all for mana efficiency or does it end up being alright?
---
Smolderweeb represent!
---
ok then i start casting when the tank is at 60%
---
Says the guy who got killed
---
True, if your weight is muscle that's fine. Carbs are just really bad for you in the long run iirc because your body prioritizes burning carbs before it burns up fat. That and carbs are bad for tooth health.
---
What the fuck I’m
---
An all on stalagg we r fucking boned
---
It's a reference to what Chromie said in the beginning of the Classic reveal trailer.
---
&gt;Someone once said you can't go home again. But they lacked vision... and a temporal discombobulator!
---
Yes I'm westfall and just recently made a guy on netherwind to try PvP and now I'm considering putting more time there...but then westfall would be even more unbalanced....tough choices
---
I'm playing a mage which which used to be my main I retail (tend to play druid more now). Loving it. Chucking powerful fire at people while levelling is awesome
---
I'd have way more but I spend around 15 gold on skills and 25 gold on blue weapons/armor while leveling.
---
What did I do? I farmed and vendored all the trash.
---
Sadly the people I'm playing with opted for a pvp server. It never would have been my choice.
---
Shadow weaving makes the mob take more shadow damage though
---
Why are you telling people how to play? Also you sound like an ass, "if not for a shaman, I would have beat a corpse camping, most OP class in the game." Settle down with the ego.
---
Or posts about loot/buying stuff.
---
That comment is regarding the price in retail. No one will pay 10k for that in classic.  It currently averages selling for 50k in retail.
---
you waited until level 40+ to get your weapon training?
---
Thanks for the input!
---
I got the vendor addon and decided to not enchant greens that vendor for &gt;50s. Maybe I need to check the AH more often for mats and advertise my professions.
---
I played vanilla shortly before TBC, so I classic is not totally new for me. But there is so much to learn even 15 years later :D
---
I do this while waiting for my SM groups to fill/get to the instance. Easy money while just waiting around anyways.
---
Ist Troll 100% because beserker gives you 10% x 10-30% speedbuff so after tacking a crit from a boss you can use it and gain 43% attackspeed. More rage, more hits, more  threat.
---
yes forever
---
so lets say you heal 60% of the tanks hp with your big heal. Instead of starting to cast at 40% hp you start casting at 60% hp of the tank so you dont risk him dying
---
Deep Frost has ALWAYS been the way to go when leveling.
---
So the same as retail, lol.
---
How do u get looking for group chat? Is that a addon?
---
He’s literally stating I don’t believe it’s beneficial. So he IS in fact disagreeing with 15 year players lol. Also the concept he isn’t grasping isn’t a wow only thing. It’s a healing in mmos thing. Ending his post that way isn’t asking for clarity on why it’s beneficial, it’s trying to be disagreeable like you know something the community doesn’t
---
That’s it thanks
---
I have some bad news.
---
And that's a good thing. 
---
The negative effects of casual racism *should* fall on the racists.
---
My server is fairly populated so I don't think that is the case. But I will check non the less! Ty
---
How much per stack roughly? I cant play til tomorrow
---
Same here fellow worried westfaller
---
Depends on levels.
---
Never downrank any of them? Lol don’t tell me you still use lesser heal...
---
Prot will get far more gear. Fury will get gear that's actually of use in PvP though.
---
What do you mean?
---
I transferred to Earthfury from Krom and I'm so glad I did. It's such a better experience. I seriously worry about these huge servers when everyone is 60 and layers are removed. I don't think Vanilla is set to sustain these levels of populations without changes from Blizzard.
---
What are 30 quests for warrior? The whirlwind axe or soemthing or are there others? I'm a 2 hand warr and I'm really looking forward to getting into those types of quests. Heard u need a group for the axe quest tho
---
Went from Northdale p server horde to Stalagg horde.. couldn’t be happier
---
It's just a bad habit to form. If you're using as just an opener and not as part of the rotation it's not so bad.
---
    /castsequence reset=target Immolate, Curse of Agony, Corruption
---
A holy paladin really does not need much timing. If he really fucks up badly, he can still freecast for 12seconds with divine shield.
---
A shaman who is actually quite squishy needs a lot more skill to bring the same utility a cleanse spamming paladin does.

This is a vanilla player / private server debate, the old ruleset from 15 years ago that most server ran on was everyone greeded BoEs but if you were going to use it you rolled need and equipped it on the spot.
---
Only now everyones on max efficiency hypes are all BoEs just seen as a gold drop that no one should be able to equip unless they in the 1/5 chance roll.
---
That is cool, man, nice work!

---
If you're interested in an addon for inventory management, adibags is fantastic
---
In general, yes, getting better results means you're a better player. Selecting the best and most efficient options is part of being a better player.
---
You called Chromie short?
---
For that thing specifically yes. I go a backstab/ambush build whilst levelling and it's super fun for the occasional horde player you come across
---
I was in a group of friends and everyone but the Mages passed.
---
No... 1 strength is still 2 ap. You just have 10% more strength. It doesn't change the value of ap per strength.
---
I just noticed this the other day. 15 years and it never clicked the coffins in the inn of UC are the beds.
---
It varies on on everyone's level. so you will have to do a run and write down the before and after XP on your bar
---
Menacing
---
As someone who is horde on stalagg this sucks, my experience has been horde favored for sure but it didn't seem this bad. Was really hoping for a balanced realm
---
Tactical mastery is so good, that and anger management are almost a must. I appreciate your insight
---
Casually I get to 60 in a couple of weeks, rushing to 60 you can do in one or less. Say rushing gives you 1-2 weeks of dungeon running - all contended with other people with hard ons for gear to be pvp gods. So you’ll have fiercer competition for the bis gear, and when I ding 60 I’ll come with all the casuals to run dungeons giving volume and more relaxed runs. 
---
Not worth rushing.
---
You can do the tail end of Desolace if you haven’t yet. Dustwallow works.
---
Also run some SM Armory/Cath runs it will boost you a level or two then get back in the swing.
---
Everything wrong with the Classic playerbase in one comment
---
it seems like a bug indeed.
---
You ever hoovered shneef off of a sleeping cow's spine?
---
I love the dreary and sort of rainy and cold atmosphere there, sort of cozy! I actually love a good rainstorm irl also so that might help it. Wetlands is one of my favourite zones!
---
I would have though. And if you play on a pvp server and let people who you call friends die to pvp without helping and being too scared to fight, you need to go on a pve server
---
No. Ele shaman's strength is time to kill. Get 5/5 convection for 10% less mana cost and clear casting.
---
All your doing is taking more damage if you downrank.
---
Just spam highest rank lb, stack spell power and watch mobs melt.
---
None of my real life pets didn't have names.

---
This, but other than that race is the only other factor to keep in mind.

He likes stamina. Let him enjoy his stamina.

2. They still drop really often. Every other jaguar was dropping a grey item that vendors for 8s.
---
No surprise my realm Flamelash is the third most Horde sided server in EU.
---
Agreed
---
retail is bad.
---
Looking smooth as the ding animation hits just as you touch the wing
---
Aww did you die? Poor little guy. We're so sorry you got outplayed :(
---
I love my PvP haha. You might want to try getting good.
---
&gt; nobody really fights much on Kalimdor
---
The Crossroads is under attack!
---
Gonna second thousand needles, avoid shimmering flats, and hug the edges. 
---
Decent amount of Copper and Iron as well.
---
Saw something similar when they dragged a dragon boss back to storm wind a couple of days ago
---
But it doesn't change the amount of attac power strength grants. It just gives you more strength, which in turn equates to more attack power by virtue of having more strength.
---
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.
---
Shitty people gonna be shitty. It's very frustrating to try finding tanks, frustration + shitty people = salt.
---
Non-mana abilities don't downrank. So it'll always use the highest.
---
i've got yelled at twice for aggroing with an imp
---
I see you don't know how to read properly. Allow me to help you.
---
In the sentence "You can do everything (pretty much) by yourself." the phrase *pretty much* is a modifier which clarifies / modifies a word (in this case *everything*) to have a different meaning.
---
The definition of "pretty much" means very nearly, just about, or almost.
---
So when I said "you can do everything (pretty much) by yourself" it means that you can do *almost* everything in the game by yourself.
---
I hope that provided some clarity to you. :)
---
Could be trans.

I was mainly looking to make it a tinder bio line "_______ chat in the streets, barrons chat in the sheets"

To add to this, guards are in or around major cities (Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Orgrimar, Undercity, Thunderbluff)
---
Well yes. OP for comment mentioned skills (all instant attacks for rogues iirc) so felt like mentioning.  Autos will hit harder natch so it can be great if you're good at keeping SnD up.
---

Friend of mine went Fire Mage at or around your level and said it was a lot of fun

Wowclassic.live is what i use, i always have something to do, currently lvl 44. It does make you travel from zone to zone though. I rarely see this guide mentioned, i wonder why.

Chose incendius. Looks like a 40/60 split not to shabby .
---
If its a pug need what you need. If its guild run sharing is caring.
---
at least you can be sure that 90% of the world understands it, unlike the abomination that is the imperial system.
---
Would any alliance on fairbanks like to help me get a pet chicken?
---
Yes in the title I said that I do not expect to get 10k for it. I’d be content with 5k, I will be holding onto it for a couple of months at least before I could even think about asking for that much.
---
I think those are old horde/ orcish clan symbols but I couldn't say more. Takes a bigger lore nerd than me
---
Then you run the risk of over healing depending on the boss and how many healers. Sometimes a max rank spell is needed or feasible, but down ranking offers the increased flexibility that using max rank doesn't.
---
I remember getting this bug or something similar back in vanilla in the middle or Orgrimmar. I think I have a video of it somewhere even. I don't know if it was visible for others though cause I think I lost connection soon after.
---
Words matter. They have consequences.
---
The negative consequences of casual racism should fall on the racists. It would be nice if Blizzard would also email out to account holders when a warning for racist behavior is handed down. I figure most of these internet tough guys live with their parents and many of them would be dumb enough not to manage to prevent the notification.
---
That's not the point, the point is rules... People like you come from private servers, which have their own etiquette and rules and expect normal people used to the rules on retail to comfort to their expectation...
---
I love pvp too, which is why i prefer people actually do it? why are you defending cowards?
---
Although it's prolly too late, you can disenchant most of the low level tailoring stuff you make (everything linen, lots of the wool items) since it vendors so low.  Easy way to boost early enchanting, or to turn in your linen into mats that sell on AH.  Wool is starting to stabilize on my server though so it's no longer worth tailoring/disenchanting I just sell the excess.    
---
Being early in a server is also gonna mess with prices a lot more than coming into an established server during TBC.  Items are hella expensive until the mass of people catch up to that level, then they're hella cheap due to insane amounts of supply, then the slowly rise more and more as money supply increases, BGs get released, things like that.  It's a moving target right now to figure out if it's better to vendor or disenchant... good luck man!
---
How likely is it that we will ever be able to freely transfer servers (like from Kirtonos, a PVP realm, to Deviate Delight, which is RPPvP). I rolled alliance on Kirtonos and I'm regretting it for two reasons - there is an enormous faction imbalance in favor of the horde, and I'd also just rather be on a more roleplay style realm.
---
maybe he hates rye
---
Smitten is slightly ambiguous with its multiple definitions whereas smote is not... But you're both right.
---
oh the clip was also funny now that I actually had a chance to watch it :)
---
See I put 5 points in the resto tree that guarantees me energy/rage. I feel like that helps with levelling speed. Pop out of form, quick rejuv, then back in with energy.
---
As a hunter this was both painful and very expensive.
---
I swapped yesterday. there is some downtime for drinking and a cost for the water.
---
but besides that its ok. not a huge fan of wearing cloth leather and mail lol but the big mana pool and not going into the resto tree makes healing instances better.
---
so far, Enjoyable.
---
Personally, I spammed lbrs.
---
Well I mean it really does suck... I never thought blizz would be able to get me to quit retail but they did...
---
When wil runecloth repeatable turn ins be a thing?
---
It’s supposed to isn’t it?
---
Maybe time to find a way out of Iran my man.
---
We live in 2019, a video is proof of absolutely nothing.
---
doesn't it use extra energy to do more damage?
---
I hope you lose all your rolls.
---
Make sure to take part in the competition every Sunday in STV if possible. After it, give your Speckled Tastyfish to Jang The Fishing Apprentice beside the Fishbot, as he will give you 23 silver for every 5 fish.

Hate to say it but try and layer hop.

Sounds like you're just trying to kill it to get a new one.
---
if you dont have it yet eventually you get levitate to save yourself from falls
---
I mean it's quite possible you're the poorest one in the group. They passed, you won the roll - all good.  
---
You do have to wonder from the other possible perspective tho - poor as shit warrior who is 60 but can't even afford to buy all skills yet passes on a BoE epic to a mage with 760g because he's being 'nice'.
---
If he doesn't have maces trained and is in the middle of a full WC run, the mace may be useless considering they'll be getting Wingblade once the run is done, before they even get to train maces
---
I thought it’s suppose to drain all your energy no matter what so you plan ahead for that
---
Is there something like this for na servers?
---
It's meant to. Read the tooltip. Any extra energy is used for damage.
---
My cousin and I were laughing today talking about server Qs; not so bad around 5 oclock but real bad at 11pm and onwards.
---
because we all used to play at 5pm after school now we play at 11pm when the kids are in bed lol.
---
As a foreign observer, Obama's policies really weakend America. Trump is doing a much better job
---
No lie...  level 38 Warrior right now and so glad I am leveling cooking as I go.  I have about 70 food items in my bag right now and 30+ bandages.  Don’t have the funds for a bunch of potions but one of these days.
---
You want peace only when it suits you little lion.
---
Uhhh excuse me what??
---
But when it increases in price it probably also means that the gold value has inflated, meaning that you don't actually have more purchasing power. Besides, waiting longer with selling BoE items means that people have longer to find better items from raids - decreasing the demand.
---
And yes it is a bit of a snarky reply but really... Do you want everyone to go and make threads asking if every item they find are worth anything on their specific server?
---
Never played with you but love the name Third 😉
---
For people more interested in tanking you can shift points to the threat/prowl boost and the bear rage crit ability
---
Ah yes, kids making jokes on social media when they were 16 is definitely more damaging than trying to ruin someone's career and life
---
Yes, most. I'm nearing 60 and I'm only just now beginning to see other *actual* tanks, not just Arms warriors with a shield (or just sitting in defensive with their 2H) going into dungeons.
---
Back when I was doing SM and Uldaman, there'd be perhaps one or two protection warriors per *hundred* Arms or Fury, all saying that they're tanking.
---
As a horde I completely skipped STV by questing in every other zone, don’t know how possible that is for alliance though.
---
Honestly it's a good strategy. USUALLY the downfall of fresh MMOs is the initial rush demands more servers but once it passes servers feel dead. (not that WoW is new, but same idea really. I've seen so many MMOs follow this pattern.)
---
I'm NOT saying classic will ever be dead by any means. I do think we had a lot of temporary tourists though.
---
Damn. F for Stalagg.  I knew it was heavy on Horde but didn't know it was this bad.
---
I'm not defending anyone. I just find it hilarious that someone would get ganked, blame other people, then make a raging forum post about it. 
---
Imagine making a mad Reddit post because you died in wow. What's next? You gonna make a post about how a mage only gave you 3 free stacks of food instead of 5 lol
---
I dinged 60 by running into darnassus as a horde druid
---
I'm sorry to inform you that your friend is not telling you the truth if that is what he said.
---
What's the add-on across the very bottom?
---
A lot of mages got this incidentally AoE grinding to 60.
---
Can I use Gnomish rocket boots immediately after equipping them, or do they have a mini cooldown upon equip?
---
It's not just some fucking joke for bored white kids. Racism kills people. It ruins lives. If you don't take that seriously then you don't deserve to be taken seriously.
---
How is the air flow around the fans? Ensure it is clear, even prop it up on a book at the back to help.
---
Also purchase some canned air and blow out the fans through the vents, if you haven’t done this recently it will help remove dust build up. Again this will help.
---
Failing all that perhaps a laptop cooling pad beneath will help cool it down. I’d try the other things first
---
I mean if it happens, so be it. 
---
Any recommendations for a new one?
---
And they're saying that a forum or sub with 0 moderation would be a worse joke than an unpaid internet janitor.
---
Maybe they are... and maybe the guy that ganked him was terribler... i mean, losing to anyone 1v1 that is 8 lvls below me would make me contemplate my life choices leading up to that moment. I'd probably uninstall.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Nevermind. It's a Questie bug and the quest itself is not in the game.  [Source](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/issues/921)
---
Just inside the first gate is rested exp in UC. I was getting ready to log out a few days ago thinking I had to take the elevator down and was surprised to see the Zzz immediately inside.
---
Could be bugged, it's a good release but not flawless.  My hunter pets take weird angles when trying to attack a mob.  It's always trying to get in front, it refuses to just chase something and hit it in the back most of the time.  Or your party yelled at you when it wasn't your fault lol.
---
You totally are playing in one my friend!
---
And ever more so, the beast that started it all! 
---
There are so many lessons I hope they learn from classic and implement them on the modern game, and revert into an MMORPG instead of a loot piñata l/slot machine unrewarding experience that modern has turned into.
---
I truly hope of two things, classic goes to the route of osrc and modern gets back in touch with its RPG roots...
---
I have more hope for the first though, I hope they prove me wrong!
---
Big oof
---
Because my friends want to play on alliance and my retail main is a shaman.
---
 Play on a server with no que
---
Don't listen to them. Some of the greatest stories in wow come from world PvP being unexpected. Ya sometimes you get corpse campped but that's why you join a guild so they can come help you. Then the opponent calls theirs soon enough it's 30 ppl all in a FFA war zone. 
---
If it's not your cup of tea that's fine but don't be swayed into a PvP server out of fear of other players.
---
The cannibalize was true icing on the cake.
---
Everyone on Earthfury is begging for everyone to transfer, because it’s SUCH  a wonderful experience!!
---
Until you see how dead the server is and everyone is just trying to justify the fact that they just moved their character onto a dead server that’s barely alive now, let alone in a few months.
---
Got one of these back in vanilla and and just used it on the spot
---
Oooh That's hot!
---
If you’re good with buying a new laptop, go spend $40 on a USB lapdesk with built in fans, will keep your laptop cool and breathing after you clean it.
---
If you play primarily on a desk, they have desk mounts for extra fans too for way cheaper than it would cost for a new laptop.
---
Lol
---
That's pretty much what you're doing. You're not looking fur ways to use what you already have. Go look up consumer reports or reviews if you just want a new laptop.
---
Alliance:
---
\-Best aesthetic
---
\-Best cities
---
\-Dwarves
---
Horde:
---
\-Best characters
---
\-Best lore
---
🎶 Rexx gonna give it to ya 🎶
---
Both have their benefits, Horde has really good PvP racials and alot of the Warlock class quests makes you take trip to barrens. Paladins and Dwarf Priests are annoying to deal with though.  
---
Alliance has really strong PvE tools with Salvation from Paladins that lets you go way more ham in PvE, but you have to face Undeads. Warlocks are generally lot less crowded on Alliance which makes it easier to get spots in raids too.  
---
Overall both sides are prefectly playable despite having different strenghts so you should pick which one ticks more boxes for you.
---
Or we could just enjoy the meme as a joke and not try to talk about modern politics.
---
Let's try the latter.
---
It isn't a bug, ferals are just trash.
---
Yes, your ferocious bite drains all your energy for "extra damage" and still isn't as strong as a 35 energy eviscerate.
---
lolferal
---
When you're playing with trusted guildies maybe. Not in pugs, where someone can need to ninja the loot.
---
Im assuming it goes alphabetical by name incase of tie?
---
ManKRIK, not Kirk :'( Not only is his wife kill but no one bothers to get his name right
---
Nobody should be getting emotional about this shit
---
But I’m a warrior too, and do what you want, but I don’t expect to just kill the bosses I want.
---
So am I!
---
Nah not really.  It's not bad by any means, but it isn't a ton of money either.
---
It depends on a lot of factors. Some weapons are outrageously good twink items, so things that physical dps class can use that require an x9 level (19, 29, 39...etc) are probably going to be the best weapon for that twink range, and because of that, very expensive. 
---
Aside from that, lower level blues with a lot of Stam are also valuable because more health = king in the lower level ranges. 
---
Outside of twinkling items, nothing is outrageously valuable yet, because everyone has their level 40 mount cost in mind. Getting 90g is already difficult enough without buying leveling gear. Once more 60s are on the server and the ecomony has more gold flowing, blues and greens will bump up a bit in price for alts and gear for friends. 
---
You can likely find some value from items as long as they are stat-ed well or are a "rarer" item slot. Things like helms, shoulders, necklaces, rings, and maybe cloaks that have good stats for their class can sell decently well because of their rarity. On my rogue, i was using a Red Defias Mask until like 50 because I kept losing rolls on all the helms I saw drop. I still wouldn't of spent 2g on a helm, because in my mind, 10 agil isn't worth 2g, but maybe 1g. 
---
Aside from that, I put anything at all itemized well up on the AH for about 1.5x - 2x the vendor price and it it doesn't sell, just vendor it after that.
---
I settled on a Rogue in vanilla, still my main when I quit BFA. Leveling a Shaman right now. I feel naked without stealth.
---
How mad are you still lmao. Not every random member of the same faction wants to die for your stupid ass, especially when there's literally no benefit to doing so atm. If you're complaining about guildmates or rl friends then maybe you should get new ones. Are you new to wow? You sound like an angry 13 year old.
---
If you've never used an air sister to blow it out this 95 % likely the problem.
---
But you're never going to have fun with pvp if you just sit there letting yourself and your group die
---
No, if theres a cheaper way that may fix it I will do it, actually following someone else's advice in this thread, thanks. Have a brilliant day 🤙
---
Once phasing is turned off, the high pop servers are all going to be complaining.
---
Any open world content will become a massive pain.
---
I wonder if they'll ever allow free transfers for the dominant faction from imbalanced servers, such as letting Horde migrate from Stalagg to an Alliance heavy server.
---
I've gotten a druid to 30, but before I get much farther along I think I might want to roll a shaman and give it a try. Before I do so, how do the two compare to one another as far as playstyle?
---
First month is almost through? Idk
---
And the opposite is true that nobody argued meme specs could do dungeons. 
---
The focus has mainly been on raiding, where a meme spec will tank the entire raid's (lol) performance. When that's not even the case. The problem is too many modern players are way too hyperfocused on endgame raiding that they fail to see that was only a small portion of what vanilla offered. 
---
Some of the best dungeon specs were the worst raid specs due to mana reasons, not outright damage. It's sad how people see only guides, pserver parses, or accept influence opinion (many of whom never even played vanilla, yet make claims based on pserver data [much of which wasn't accurate]) as fact without taking time to think or seek to understand better for themselves.
---
Isn’t some scripting here necessary? Trying to recast this macro after the GCD for the trap would just recast feign death wouldn’t it? (Or rather, it might cancel the feign death)
---
Says the guy posting and crying about PvP in wow lmao
---
Maybe he was on a dead shard or something but Boralus and SW is still pretty full for me.
---
Ion is a game developer for both Classic and Retail so i think hes drowning in money instead of bricking himself.
---
Dwarves and Trolls are the chillest races
---
Then let's not make memes political? Why did he have to use Obamas face?
---
Some of my favorite memories are from l2 and Aion, in the early days where pvp just happened.
---
Yes but that walking leads to interaction. Like ants, i know it's annoying, but it has sense
---
Yes. Article is very clear on this data being very unreliable but people just read the graphs and assumes it's truth from blizzard. It's probably very alliance sided but not 99%
---
Well that's the plan but it's harder than you think xD it's expensive and getting a visa is hard.
---
Do it, make a character and level up, a priest is a good starter option; you’ll find groups fast and you can solo quickly as shadow but still heal instances
---
I have such low opinion on streamers and their begging. Asmongold got a fucking parade for hitting 60.
---
The bias to one faction really shows \#FakeNewsMedia
---
Youre way ahead of the curve of normal players thats why. Most players are 30 and under right now
---
\*Barrens
---
Impressive. This deserves all the up votes. This deserves to be pinned to front page. More impressive than any Classic world firsts. Well done. Well. Done.
---
My wife has a gel bag for icing aching body parts.  I put that under the hottest part of the laptop when the fan gets really loud, and it quiets down quickly.  You probably don’t need to spend extra on a special “laptop” cooling pad.
---
less than you obviously lmao. Like I'm the one that got betrayed why are you mad?
---
If you've got a full group of 40 level 60s... it won't matter. People are roflstomping MC. I'm curious to see how BWL is.
---
In vanilla, I tanked MC, BWL, ZG, and AQ with that 31/5/15 build...
---
Yeah get a cooling rig attachment. Cheapest quick fix other than delving into performance issues.
---
That’s WC and you’re Allie. How?
---
Not domestically.

Deflect all you want my dude. You still died and cried lmao

Im actual not sure, but I think you need to have the specific riding skill.

I WANNA TALK ABOUT.................................................ICE CREAM
---
This. I used to work at a company that made equipment for biomedical research, and we were not allowed to sell to sanctioned countries despite the companies being medical research companies searching for cures to diseases that plague us all. We weren't even allowed to call them or accept their calls.
---
My imp is jibham
---
Looks like you ”kissar i kors”
---
Fairly likely but will be paid and probably not for at least 6 months.
---
What is the most active server to switch to for alliance raiding? I was told westfall is very heavily alliance ~70% and very active. Any suggestions? playing priest btw
---
Buddy, are you okay? If you need to talk about something I'll DM you
---
tank dh and rogue
---
\-&gt; classic tank warrior
---
That seems like a rather odd choice considering you don't get travel form till 30.
---
Ooomg they betrayed you? This sounds serious man. You should report them to Blizzard lmao
---
Then play dwarf female, people will just assume you have some weird fetish.
---
Depends on your professions. I had about that much at 30 as a tailor/Skinner, now I'm almost 37 and have about 60g from selling medium/heavy leather, and I'm finally getting to Thick leather which is worth way more so I think I'm on a good pace. But if you don't have a lucrative gathering profession then you're gonna cut it close.
---
When I log on now Details! says that its threat meter is now working properly.
---
I swear kromkush has the most twisted barrens chat
---
You could always disable the Mechanostrider sound or replace it with something else. I always did this with guns and pets as a hunter.
---
You really think blizzard would not mess it up?
---
This is pretty much the reason I didn't go tailor with my priest.  Level an entire profession, pay for the pattern, pay for the mats... all for a BoP you can't make a profit from. Sure it's BiS, but man.
---
You can make the same argument for Tauren, but they are the least popular Horde race.
---
The way stat values work on items at 60 you're better with attack power and flat increased chance to crit.
---
Soul-link build is decent, plus you have Fel-domination to quickly resummon a pet.
---
I'm not sure about the lore part, night elf is a beast when it comes to that (war of the ancients trilogy)
---
Does warrior ever get fun? Just dinged 20 and so bored..
---
To tell me more about how you were betrayed? Lmao.
---
ha ironic
---
i didnt knew that there are +flat heal stats on equipment. Only if you have those you make healing more efficient with lower ranks.
---
nearly everybody failed to mention that besides one or two people showing that that most of the 15 year old players dont understand why down ranking is mana efficient in the late game
---
Are there forges in Orgrimmar that are closer than Valley of Honor? Are there any in Valley of Strength or the Drag? I can't find good info anywhere online on this for Classic WoW. Thanks!
---
It couldn't happen to nicer people.
---
Correct. It saves mana in the sense that it's more efficient to use a lower rank for a smaller heal than to use a max rank for a smaller heal which will almost certainly overheal. The more spell power you have that can apply to these lower ranks as well, the more feasible it becomes to use.
---
Basically decrease the graphic settings to the lowest possible as well as lowering the resolution will help alot.
---
I pass on stuff and I'm broke. It's just pixels man
---
It sells because its BiS for 19 rogues. What specifically about rp servers would change that?
---
Who are these people with nice bosses? Ive never seen such a thing
---
Please stay! As the general populace levels, there will be more people available to do content with.
---
The top raiding guild &lt;GRIZZLY&gt; is alliance on stalagg. There will still be a healthy alliance pop there at 60 to sustain the raiding.
---
There are mob abilities that drop threat, like if your pet get's net'ed the mob will come after you. Some mobs like machines are also immune to taunt and your pet won't make much threat on them.  
---
Threat addons are pretty buggy atm, even at their best they were pretty dodgy - they really only work well in raids.
---
Are you okay buddy?
---
Of course not. Sociopaths don't normally admit when they make mistakes.
---
It shouldn't matter much on normal servers. All that matters is the absolute number of Horde.
---
Fish oil and scales never have any value anyway. They'll be pretty worthless a year from now still.
---
Yeah dude. Just killed a group of allies with some buddies. You?
---
1g20 to 1g80 per stack on Flamelash-EU
---
Dude talk to me, what's up?
---
I’ve got The Rake. I’ll be carrying him all the way to 60. His name right now is just Rake.
---
gz
---
Kinda pointless, you can tank everything up to ubrs as any spec
---
For a lock it has to be horde. Facing melee classes with Will of the Forsaken is just not fun.
---
Also horde are fucking miles cooler... unless looking ‘pretty’ is your thing...
---
I chose Shaman over Druid because if you want to pvp it's more interesting. You can dope around with Enhancement, which is great for countering ganks while leveling. You don't just auto attack and wait, you can weave Shocks (mouseover Earth Shock macro is clutch), Earthbind kite (get a swing timer), and Windfury procs are so satisfying. Then at 60 for raiding you have Resto (Chain Heal is satisfying as hell), Enh pvp if you like, or my preference would be the 30/0/21 Elemental build. Big Chain Lightnings plus nice heals for your group's Warriors, and sufficient for 5man dungeons healing with a single gear set.
---
Contrary to all of those, Druids have interesting pve damage if you go Feral, or you can tank for 5mans. But Boomkin is an absolute joke and in PvP you're mostly good at... Not dying. You make a great flag carrier but that didn't interest me. Tanking is fine for 5man dungeons but not really viable for raids. 1v1 you're just looking to attrition everyone. Yeah Travel Form and free root breaks are nice, but Ghost Wolf is pretty sweet too. They really exemplify jack off all trades, ace of none.
---
What a shitter casual
---
Same, couldn't care less about the actual numbers. I find the psychology interesting though.
---
Haha, cute. We’ve all done stupid shit like this, don’t worry about it.
---
ive actually been wondering , i. pretty sure there is a heap of bugs and changes but my memory of vanilla is as expected pretty shitty
---
An easy one is Mara ,otherwise get a group and do bed farms
---
krom gang
---
Yeah just cat form. Like I said, not great.
---
That was your opportunity to say strangero and you missed it.
---
youre a psychopath
---
Really? That's interesting, is there a place I can find that info?
---
I love the way numbers work so it's fun for me to do calculations like this.
---
hell yeah ashbringer
---
Blow.
---
I wouldn't worry about addons until you settle on a class and get some time under your belt. After a while you'll notice little inconveniences or areas where you could be more efficient, that's when you start looking for addons or macros to improve.
---
Ooh shit, I had forgotten about LFG!
---
Oh yes! Its my two years old xiaomi mi max 2, but soon I will have enough saving for a samsung note
---
Ya no one is abusing guys, don’t worry about it!
---
Meanwhile asmongold layers an entire raid group over while farming crusader enchant and devilsaur leather...
---
I can comment on the API. They changed and kept the whole retail version of it. Vanilla used the be free reign with scripts and addons. It was a glorious time for addon developers, but there were downsides like botting, etc.
---
One thing we did loose (because of the change) from vanilla to classic is a focus target. This was achieveable via scripts in vanilla. Now there is no focus target like we had, which were very useful for CC targets/etc... Not that 1.13 needs cc anymore, vanilla to classic is vastly different in terms of difficulty. This game is a cake walk in comparison.
---
I have like 900 Gold and don't want to waste it on a ugly Horse on my  Warlock, but I can't really spend 800g on Runecloth either...

2H Arms is a hard counter to soft or semi-soft targets. They charge around like a gigantic delete button. Prot doesn't have the damage output to handles softies and gets eaten alive. However, Prot will absolutely dominate a similarly geared *delete button*.
---
This was Prot's most ideal matchup, other than the level differences.
---
They make laptop stands with extra heat pull fans. As well as making sure you clean your lappy regularly with dust off and make sure you dont have background processes running. I know alot of windows features can cause excessive,ram usage and can be turned off easily. A quick Google search can help you with both the stand and windows  to minimize ram. Also get hwmonitor or a different heat monitoring program that you can track the heat with.

I've done my own census a few times and each time it has been either 50/50 or a slight Alliance advantage

I rerolled on the server and I now have a lvl23 Shaman

cool good to know.

Dust out your laptop. It's probably caked with dust if it's old

lol i got you buddy.

Thanks for the tip :)
---
Oh okay, if they are counting alts and people who haven't played in 14 days, then it's kind of wonky, those revised figures are much more encouraging and seem more in line. Been out in Hinterlands today, relatively unpacked zone and have seen a good balance,
---
Ah, thanks for the reply
---
Ahh, good to know.

Any idea about the stopping though? what do you use?
---
People kill people for reasons. Some good, some bad. Racism falls into the latter category. The more we tolerate it the more will die. This or that "joke" may or may not specifically contribute but it's irresponsible speech either way.
---
I don't care about the "rent free in your mind" talk. I am triggered sometimes and sometimes not but either way the right thing to do is to stand up against it and so I do. Tolerating racism is not OK.
---
This is world of warcraft  not world of co-existcraft!
---
Wow what amazing luck you have. Every realm I've looked into has been a cesspool of toxic children and manbabies.
---
I did not. I was about 5-6k into honored until Thursday morning.
---
Does the serrated blades talent for rogues effect skills like eviscerate or only regular attacks?
---
Spirit holds as much value as int when leveling as a warlock, because you are frontloading your dots and then wanding.
---
Start in a pvp Server if you like pvp.. its way more fun than a pve Server

My friend refuses to buy it. He has ankh and ressurecting people doesn't benefit him as much as the money.
---
You doing any dungeons? Warrior feels best when you get heals I think
---
Skinning is great. Started grinding mobs at lvl 35 in Swamp of Sorrows, had 103 gold by lvl 39. Getting gold for your mount is not hard if you actually do some grinding and don’t waste gold on useless spells.
---
Yeah, I'm surprised I haven't seen a list of the obvious changes, would be fun to see.
---
All fair enough but wasn't the appeal of Classic "warts and all"? People were always accused of being overly nostalgic and not remembering all the BS that went on in Classic. This is part of that BS, no? I feel like we can't pick and choose the parts we want.
---
Does anyone else love the feeling of waiting at the zeppelin with a crowd of folks? Then you reach your destination and everyone gets on/off and starts making their way down the path with their own agendas. It feels like you're a part of a true living breathing world.
---
Yeah, if you click the data link you can see a level group breakdown. The 20+ range is more interesting. Lot of mules/tourists sub 20

---
Hes playing. He posted a video recently of him questing and doing some WPVP at level 36 on the streamer server.
---
Improve drain soul requires the killing blow WITH drain soul to work, or has that been changed in classic?
---
I could tell yesterday when I was in STV Alliance outnumbers us like 10:1 but overall since launch I haven't really had an issue getting groups for things and Horde side still seems healthy overall. If we were a PvP server I'd be more concerned. I do wish the servers (especially ones that popped up launch night) had more neutral names for better balance
---
My man. You have to give me hope. I feel like I screwed over my shot at this.  I didn't do the starter night elf zones so now I'm lvl 44 and half way through honored.  What was your rep when you hit 60 and what did you farm to get to exalted??
---
I just got my tabard and wear it proudly.
---
(I sold the gloves though don't tell momma Whitemane)
---
If you don't specify which rank, a /cast NameOfSpell macro will cast your highest rank of that spell, even for spells that use mana.
---
I disagree! Spell damage at that level is widely accepted as an inferior stat, the spell modifiers for dots and drains at that level hardly increase damage at all. You have to STACK shadow damage to make it worth it and there aren't a lot of spell power options before level ~50. Int is a good stat, but I can see Stam being valued higher than int especially for warlocks and especially for pvp. But maybe we live in different worlds. 😉
---
This was a huge myth back in vanilla wow.
---
I would actually use a laptop camera to record him taking a pic then freeze frame and take another pic of that then upload it. Crystal clear

You bet.  As a warlock your more about the utility than the dps, but they are solid at both.  For me the loc shines when things get out of control...so if the group goes smooth and nothing goes wrong the loc is almost un-noticed.  It's when there is an bad pull, and we are in trouble and going to wipe....and the loc saves the day that the good ones will shine.
---
Doing stuff like fearing, but keeping the feared mob bouncing and not aggroing with curse of rec bouncing.  Keeping the healer and tank (and any dps that asks) stocked with candie, and rez stone.
---
For me, a "good" player is one you don't even notice if the run goes smooth.  This goes for tank, dps, and heals.  It's when the fit hits the shan that you'll notice the good player, because he/she made magic happen.  As long as your asking yourself what would make you better as part of the group, you'll end up being good.  It's the people who are not paying attention, or are not willing to adjust their pacing (fast or slow) to the rest of the group that stand out but not in a good way.
---
All of that is just my personal opinion, and what I enjoy from groups.  I'm an old man tho, and realize that things have changed and are changing with the way groups work....so take it with a grain of salt.  :)
---
What does PST mean when people are looking for dungeon group?

---
Literally what the fuck
---
As far as I remember such a thing was added in late vanilla in eastern plaguelands
---
Hello! So I noticed your posting of more journalists and columnists. I'm not sure if this is added flavor, but if it isn't, and you really want people to help and write for fun, I'm super interested! I love this!
---
details.
---
combines a lot things into one addon. including a threat meter
---
but as long as you have any threat meter, your party will be able to track your threat. they're all compatible right now. so pick the one you lile
---
Not the point. Like the flavor of playing as prot and while you an tank anything up to UBRS as any spec, its easier for everyone in your group if you do it as prot. Easier to hold threat, less healing needed, and can do things at a slightly higher level than if you were arms or fury.
---
I usually hate paladins and holy types in games but in the warcraft universe they’re actually pretty badass.
---
Unfortunately, they’re absolute arse to play.
---
The one and only exception that comes to mind is that holy pala was really fun to play in cata. Tanky as hell with tonnes of instant-cast heals making them a great healer to solo queue BGs with to the point where healer carry was even possible.
---
Interesting.  Sounds like a bug in tooltip display where you're not actually doing the dmg, or a bug where it's actually affecting wand dmg.  It didn't on live except when bugs caused it to and those got fixed.
---
Dwarves get bad backne. This is why they are always reminding each other.
---
Please send tell
---
That's exactly what I thought. That he might try and swim away and down to bait him to follow and then drown his ass.
---
Right. But lower ranked abilities that don't use Mana doesn't exist. You can only ever use the highest.
---
You're in luck! 
---
Those zones were in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands and were in fact in vanilla so will most likely be back. Although they were a rather late addition i believe with or just before naxxramas
---
You can, yes. I think that's actually the default keybind for zoom in/out
---
Yeah, but even then it’s just autoattack..
---
Don't worry, I didn't do the night elf zones either. I rushed to 60 and skipped a lot of questing with dungeon farm and a bit of AOE grinding. I was half way into honored at 60. Did the remaining 27k with Runecloth turnins.
---
Or maybe she had a carrot on a stick
---
Don't forget that AQ set the precedent that new spell ranks drop, so progress without affecting the base game isn't entirely gear dependant.
---
because alliance players don't even has their res trained

Hi, /u/RazorSharp10

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4ajpk/what_is_this_sorcery/). 
---
Please send tell. They just want you to whisper them.
---
I thought I was the only one that has ever done this!
---
Is the Reck-Ret pally style still viable or was that mainly for private servers?  I heard something about it being fixed for Classic.
---
Our BG wait times will be tiny
---
buy a desktop pc and join /r/pcmasterrace
---
It all started with Obamas smirk
---
This is why done wars tank with a 2h, especially if they just got an op wep like whirlwind weapons or ravage axe. Much more damage = easier time with threat and more rage...provided you can take the damage
---
the effects are great in some zones i thought i flew to the wrong zone yesterday because i didnt recognise where i was.
---
dont know why most mmo's dont do this anymore including retail (not that i play retail)
---
Or innervate a rogue...
---
TIL that you could keep extra pets! Lol ty!
---
Good luck trying to AoE farm in classic. It’s in vogue thanks to fucking streamers bandwagoning for views and every grind spot with have 2-3 mages per layer, even at 4 in the morning.
---
I have some AoE talents in my build for when the opportunity naturally presents itself but I’d strongly recommend that you keep shatter in your build.
---
Idk what that means
---
casual
---
Yes you can, but mouse wheel is a fairly valuable leybind imo so I save it for that. I remind zoom to ctrl+mousewheel
---
I was born in Germany, but perhaps I am from Tirisfal Glades. I also belong to a community greater than any borders or walls.
---
Stay strong my dudes and dudettes from Iran, we ALL are with you.
---
Wow I think I’m wasting my time then, I had thought it would take ridiculous amounts of cloth
---
I'm so glad to be on Blaumeux, the most balanced server!
---
Greetings from Israel, 
---
I truly hope that you'll be able to play with out restrictions.
---
See you on azeroth,
---
For the Horde!
---
I'm originally from proudmoore I was a gnome warlock from BC-wotlk named Ganndolo. Would be dope to hear from anyone from my old guild "Havoc"
---
Do you mind sharing that build?
---
Yea I really like gnomes because I rolled as one first but... god i want to see my gear and not swim or jump through the tiniest obstacle. Probably going to end up going orc maybe undead
---
I have: Havit HV-F2056 15.6-17 Inch Laptop Cooler Cooling Pad (Look it up on Amazon) and love it. My laptop gets really hot (even with 3 laptop fans) and this has helped it tremendously. I run my graphics at the highest level possible but am also using a gaming laptop meant for it.
---
Mages just getting whatever the fuck they want whenever the fuck they want with ease /cry
---
Just started a dwarf warrior, reached level 13 and followed a random party off a cliff and to darkshore. There are lots of quests my level which is good but I foolishly set the inn. Now the party members think I’m stuck here, is there any way back to iron forge once I’ve finished here or should I level onwards here?
---
Rogues were always my try the starting area class. I've been dozens of level 6-10 rogues across many realms on retail. 
---
I have never mained a rogue
---
that's what I do 90% of the time
---
Rets still worse in pvp than most classes tbf
---
I can go to Orgrimmar on Retail and see many people from many different realms, you are misinformed with how Cross Realm works currently in Retail in regards to capital cities. Now, this is different on RP realms, this should work the way you described it specifically on RP realms. 
---
Also, Cross Realm is not only in old expansion zones. Go to Nazjatar right now and turn War Mode on. I guarantee you, there will be people from various servers with you.
---
As Alliance players we have to show em who’s running the server. Kill every horde player you ever see, no matter level. Gank them over and over again, till they give up and log out. /spit on them. Be as aggressive and crazy as possible.
---
Revelation! overwhelming majority of UD rogue and mage mains googled "what is the most OP race / class combo" before creating thier characters
---
omg i never saw a grammatical error before, thanks for sharing your high IQ, super duper brownie cheese for you
---
As a warrior this gives me a weird boner... 
---
Sighs
---
*Unzips*
---
Whoa there, slow down speedster!
---
i'm level 42 dude
---
The only other discount is from the pvp rank system.
---
Upvoting your downvoting.  I agree with this.
---
Still be more fun than doing TBC and Wrath again.
---
no u dont get it theyre advertising for m+ and m+ didnt exist in classic reee nochanges
---
He also asked for first play through.
---
50+
---
Who hurt you my dude... get help asap
---
No. I'm a healer. I just love it. So, priest again. I however could not be an elf this time so I'm a two toed troll with a pun name.
---
WoD taught me that racials is all they care about, thus they rerolled to human.
---
Ya, WoWhead is pulling data from something else, not really sure what. But it's counting Level 1s and alts and inactive characters.
---
When you factor those out, you get the true results. Glad to hear you're seeing a solid balance too!
---
Ouch. Umm yeah, forget that. I know on Bigglesworth, they're offering free transfers. Hopefully you get an opportunity.
---
Incendius, baby! The only fairly balanced regular PVP server, with a substantial population, and queues no higher than 2,000 people. So glad I'm on that one.
---
Hey, it's definitely not an added flavour, we would be glad to have more people to contribute.
---
As I wrote above to kodyodyo:
---
It’s not THAT efficient, but still! +5 is like you are virtually a level higher (if weapon skill is trained to max). While grinding mob, I often feel like 1 or 2 level difference between me and the mobs is huge: +1/2 compared to me I il probably have to bandage afterward; -1/2 I can kill quite a lot before having to regen. 
---
It’s not 100% accurate, others things are involved in level difference (defense, stats...), but still a nice way to think about +skill efficiency
---
Mate you'll realize this down the road but those "rules" about needing an expensive BoE were made because of that shit. You realize that they get maybe a few levels use out of boe before you can usually get a new upgrade. Lv 60 players who makes alts will twink it out and spend wayyyy more gold on those cause it doesn't matter to them, gold isn't an issue for an alt.
---
The meta developed because people got smarter, just need cause if you don't I will and anyone who actually matters skill wise in this game isn't going to think I'm a ninja. It's just how the game develops. If the guy wins the roll then he can use it, idc but a lot of players will still be disappointed cause the actually value of the item is way less while you're leveling your first char.
---
SM/Master Summ would actually be a stupidly obnoxious build to go against with how much survivability it gives to Warlocks.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing
---
You can set your hearth anywhere.
---
So do you bring this up and say everyone should need all the boes when you pug a dungeon or do you just need shit and if they don't notice and greed, well that's on them?
---
You were chatting (pretty iffy) irl politics in a rp guild. People don't tend to appreciate that.
---
Why not grab one pug? Adds to the social of the game!
---
Questing in Hillsbrad has been so much fun. Constant 10v10 battles. Seemed like every day the control of the zone changed. One day, horde had it. Next day, alliance had it. Was a constant struggle for dominance.
---
Was so sad when I had to move elsewhere.
---
I was deliberately spamming Shield Block to prevent any Overpower, which (via Prot talent) is a 100% block rate for 2x attacks every 6 seconds. He has a Truesilver Champion which is 3.0 attack speed. I knew this, it's also why I wouldn't turn my back to him unless he was stunned (shields won't block from behind).
---
Overpower is something I was deliberately denying him.
---
It hasn't changed, it does require the killing blow, however when specced for improved drain soul, you are likely going deeper into affliction, which all you need are your dots and a voidwalker to be efficient at grinding at that point. Immo, corrup, and CoA will all nearly fall off by the time you recall your void from the mob and drainsoul for the kill. That will increase your chances significantly of proccing the buff. 
---
I'm not a farmer that dots 3+ mobs at a time atm, so dotting 2 and fearing one is sufficient enough for me to maintain my mana pool, for at least 6 pulls of groups of 2 before needing to drink, in the most ideal circumstances. This is also while lifetapping and using healthstones at appropriate times.  
---
If I'm only pulling 1 at a time, it is pretty rare for me to need to drink unless I had to deal with a ganker or an accidental group pull.
---
dilate
---
That sounds so fun and wholesome!  If you guys always have the 4 of you it will be relatively easy to also just grab one more random DPS to fill out the group...  but yeah, if you're over leveled a bit you could 4-man a lot of the dungeons... just might take longer since you're missing a DPS and things won't die as quickly.
---
Why do people keep repeating this?  BGs will be cross-realm, and overall the horde/alliance pop is very close to 50/50.  Queues for both sides will be just fine, regardless of what server they are on.
---
Warriors are the traditional tank, paladins are great healers.
---
You might struggle a bit with your DPS being partially mage. Mages are underwhelming in single target, and your comp wouldn't work for aoe farming. Hunter's major benefit comes from their ability to damage overleveled enemies, which would be nullified if you're overleveling on the dungeon a bit. If you overlevel the content enough that your warrior can 2h/dual wield tank instead of needing a shield that'd help.
---
By no means impossible, just things to keep in mind.
---
I'm surprised that our realm is only 60% horde, I wonder why so many alliance rolled here
---
gAmErS rIsE uP!1!
---
Insightful arguement
---
Thanks for the advice but I don't feel like starting all over again, I guess I need to get used to it
---
Layering is such BS, can't wait for it to go
---
Any chance you could link a sample talent build around level 45? I'm prolly gonna swap, enh has gotten rather lame.
---
Former laptop repair technician here. There's a couple things that will cause hitting your maximum CPU/GPU temp and cause a hard shutdown:
---
-Dust buildup in the fan intake. Getting a can of air and blowing it into the intake may be enough to clear it out, however often times if the buildup is severe enough this won't be enough and the dust cake will either not budge or you'll just blow it further into the heat-sink. 
---
-Because of prolonged use of the laptop at high temperatures with a clogged fan intake, the thermal paste on the CPU and GPU has "burnt" and is no longer providing ample heat transfer between the chips and the heat-sink. 
---
In situations where you're hitting your max temperature this easily, it's likely both of these are the case with your laptop. To remedy this, depending on the model, the laptop will need to be either partially or fully disassembled so the dust can actually be blown out of the machine instead of just blown further into it, and to also remove the burnt thermal paste from the CPU/GPU and replace it with new paste. 
---
For some laptop models (generally older ones) this is really quite easy, a few screws will get your back cover popped off, and a few more will allow you to take off your cpu/gpu heat-sink and clean out the dust and apply new thermal paste. 
---
For some models (generally newer ones) you've literally got to tear down the entire thing just to get to the point where you can get to this heat-sink.
---
If you're interested in posting the make/model of your machine, I can let you know just how easy/difficult it is to get into your laptop to perform this maintenance.
---
any luck yet?
---
Imagine trying to gatekeep being a weeb.

&gt;!Lady Prestor's version of going shopping, but forgetting to change from your pyjamas.!&lt;
---
Congratulations!!! 🎊
---
This is a beautiful story thanks for sharing
---
PST, and that's my time zone too. I didn't think of going ahead into an eastern time server!
---
I still don't understand how retail lost all of then classic aspects 
---
Maybe that's why I quit after BC as I knew it was a slow motion elevator crash
---
As a Tauren Shaman I am a minority.
---
Yeah that's how I've been feeling Stalagg's population difference has been...
---
Actually didn't notice till you brought it up. wow
---
OP had +8 to start with. When he takes that piece off, he loses 8. When he puts +16 on he gains the 8 lost plus the 8 extra. So he gains 8.
---
So you’d be cool with someone posting a trump wow meme? Sure
---
Wow not bad at all, thank you
---
Flamelash is like 38-62 if I’m reading this right ? I hope it doesn’t become even more skewed for horde in the future.
---
People play games for fun.
---
Some, quite rightly, don't want to have to deal with people who believe weird things.  They want to have fun and not have to "debate" sexist subjects such as that men are funnier than women. 
---
Just consider it a bad fit and move on.
---
But when you over heal you're not being mama efficient, that's my point. Sure, in a perfect world where 100% of your heal is applied 100% of the time then you always want to use max rank, but this usually isn't the case.
---
Where have you been? Places I would recommend are Arathi, Badlands and southern STV (around Booty Bay).
---
Thank you for advice, I guess I just need to get used to classic
---
www.classicwow.live has a really great online guide thats free and fantastic class guides as well
---
im playing a paladin for healing but getting ravager was a highlight of the cleave leveling process
---
the best thing is you get to use it from like level 38 to 51 or 52ish
---
At level 14 your gold making potential is pretty low, I would focus on getting your character leveled up while being as frugal as you can be with your money (only buy skills you need, don't buy gear from auction house, etc... all the stuff you have heard already.)
---
Once you hit the 30's and up, gold comes in a lot more easily. Even grey-vendor items sell for considerably more silver and there's a lot more spots you can farm for items people actually want. 
---
As far as joining a guild, there's no real benefit other than having people to socialize with and potentially easier grouping for dungeons. So far I have just thrown my character into a leveling guild that has 300\~ people so it's an extra place to advertise when we need people for a dungeon run. Totally up to you if you want to or not, but you can meet interesting people who are willing to craft things for you for just base mats or even sometimes free and lots of good information sharing. Good luck out there dude!
---
Currently reckoning is hotfixed to only reset your auto attack swing timer, there was a bug that allowed you to get double swings and the attack reset timer.
---
I really hope blizzard is fixing reckoning because the current one is garbage.
---
This is when I level my alt haha just run back to you body and log on to a different toon for five to ten minutes and they will be gone when you get back. Works for me every time
---
Yeah, it's quite obnoxious as hell to go anywhere after Duskwood/Wetlands and basically be outnumbered by Horde everywhere.
---
!solved
---
Forgot about War Mode, but yeah, cross realm is enabled there for obvious reasons. However, I checked both Orgrimmar and Dazar'alor, and couldn't find any players from other realms (and I'm not on an RP server). Maybe it's enabled for dead realms?
---
Cool you're one of thousands.
---
Don't be a fucking weirdo?
---
You mean you got triggered?
---
I would try to absorb and read information as you go.  It’s useful as a Hunter to know which type of beasts bring different things to the table so definitely do some searches on best Hunter pets.
---
Also once you get some stable slots opened up grab a per or two that is just fun for you (not everything should be min/max).
---
Look at a couple leveling guides also to help you decide which skill tree and build to go down.  Beast Mastery and Marksmenship are both pretty good depending on your play style.  
---
I’d also recommend taking time out to learn fishing, cooking and first aid as you go - they can be useful and gives you some relaxing stuff to do in between grinding quests.
---
My issue is that there's rarely a chance for me to 1v1 someone my level, because I know there's a group just around the corner and I can't afford to be on a shit list on Stallag while in a contested zone. Definitely a bummer
---
Let’s see a pally tank MC in classic. Ain’t gonna happen.
---
There was a time where I thought I agreed with them. But even then I thought that was unacceptable behaviour towards your customers.
---
"Kupfervorkommen".
---
Que times won't matter bg's are apparently gonna be cross realm
---
There’s been one up on Arugal AH for 300g for close to a week
---
Great another pixel graphics game. There are so many of these coming out its starting to seem from the outside that it's just easier to toss some sprites in there and call it a day rather than spending their time and energy in halfway decent and modern graphics. Similar in Nostalgia grab culture we've got going on today. People grew up with pixel sprites let's just shit a bunch of those out!
---
I've bumped into a few but most are chill folk who want to play again.
---
If you have picked up the connecting flight paths, you can just fly back. 
---
If you haven’t, you are just going to have to run (and probably die a lot).
---
Either way, make sure to pick up the flight path before you leave
---
Wait, really? Well.. nice.. damn
---
Thanks for the link.  I dont Reddit well.
---
No one's going deep feral for PvP or leveling though. NS+HotW is the most common spec and is great in PvP, and it's mainly feral tree. Even if you ditch NS for deeper feral you can do just fine against warriors and rogues in my experience, just gotta be a bit more careful.
---
Dudes just sharing something that he thinks is interesting no need to bash on his parade.
---
Imagine falling for this joke 10 years later.
---
Those are Russian servers. And I guess all the Russians only want to play Alliance
---
Thunderbluff is the best city in the best zone. Fight me.
---
"Kupfervorkommen". The language of heavens I see.
---
Same... with friends or guildies.
---
You do not need an animal's name to make it like and obey you by giving it food. You need a demon's name in order to summon it from the nether and bind it's will to yours.
---
Why would you scare them?
---
You are more than welcome to provide some view from the Horde side  if you're interested. :-)
---
i dont know if there is a trial just start. i think you are over thinking the whole process of starting with wow a bit.. Just do it.
---
If you like pvp, go pvp Server.
---
I am a Flamelash horde player and I think the factions are evenly balanced.
---
Ran SFK the other day and someone got a low roll in the 40s or 50s. That was the highest roll. I got a single digit and everyone else was either 20s or 30s
---
trump, theresa may, kim jong un.  Go for it.  As long as it's just their picture/expression and not trying to say something about the real world.
---
Makes me want to transfer tbh
---
You’ll need 225 exactly for the quest to show up. For horde you’ll go to hammerfall in arathi and do the triage quest. Use the bandages he gives you on NPCs that show up on the ground. Shift-v helps see them
---
Well fought
---
Earthshaker EU represent!
---
I'm sure faerlina is closer to 60-40 A
---
/u/vredditshare
---
That wouldn’t be very _Classic_ of me.
---
In TBC plus my favorite has been druid. I've had other classes maxed but that was always my fav. Now I'm duo leveling a warlock and rogue, both I've never played.
---
Lmao the boomkins ARE the healer and forever will be if not for people who are willing to try stuff like this.
---
it means GTFO of here with political talk.
---
Gold only. 17 hours Thursday, 18 hours Friday, 5 hours today. Was enough for Runecloth in ah + mount.
---
Yes, use the zone channel you are in, or join channels like /world and /lookingforgroup which are both global channels.
---
&gt;Traversing STV, arathi, and even hillsbrad feels awful. I haven’t reached higher level zones yet but I’m sure it isn’t much better.
---
It's actually better. I haven't encountered any PVP lately except in the pyramid in Hinterlands. All level 45+ zones feel very safe. People want to hit 60 now when the grind is starting to get serious.
---
Yeah, the Shout/Bandie combo I was anticipating either of us would do at any moment so I had WotF on the ready. I never did it to him because I was rage starved most of the fight (Shield Block Spam keeps me low). If you look closely when we were fighting just before I jumped off, I was so starved for rage I had to dance to Zerker stance and Rage then immediately went back to D-stance. I made sure I had a fresh Shield Block up before I did this to mitigate any extra damage from Z-stance.
---
By the time we got in the water and I was ready to finish him, my Bloodrage was off CD.
---
every skill caps out at 300 currently
---
These guys are all totally right that you can, for the most part, play anything and enhancement is totally viable. That being said, keep in mind when playing that as an enh shaman you are taking the same slot a rogue or warrior would take and that generally, healers are much more in demand than dps. 
---
While you *absolutely* can raid as enh (they’re also great in pvp for what it’s worth) just be aware that there may be players who expect you to heal, as it is shamans optimal raid spec and your guild may be short on healers. 
---
Ultimately though, preparedness and commitment is more important than anything. As a raid leader, I’d rather take an enhance that shows up every raid, brings consumables, and knows the fights than a fury warrior who doesn’t.
---
I play on a german server and I‘m from a german speaking country. Still play wow in english because dwarves are ridiculous funny
---
Nobody knows the context. What precipitated the whisper? "lvl # tank looking for run" message sent by tank? 
---
Is it possible that the tank posted "Tank looking for mara princess run" and then the person responded with looking for a full Mara run? Sure. But would have to see the full context.
---
I tanked in vanilla and thru much of BC before moving to healer. I get how annoying it can be, I get the slow leveling.  
---
But I've been running into more and more frequently tanks only wanting to go to dungeons if a piece of loot is reserved for them. Obviously they have priority already on any tanking pieces, but it's usually DPS gear that they won't come and tank unless they are guaranteed it. Which I find odd because I'm level 47. We're not talking about pre-raid Best in slot gear coming from ZF.
---
They added jousting back in Wrath. The Argent Tournament. It's fun, once or twice.
---
Hahaha! This made me laugh out loud!
---
r/cringe
---
Cuz you went outta your way to make it seem its either the 1 boss I wanna kill or it's no boss and then proceeded to press the argument when he woulda been done with the conversation a minute before that.

I cry

Good thing it was mentioned earlier in the same thread that the BGs aren't out. It is utterly ridiculous that we won't have a single BG for almost a year post launch.
---
I love stalking in cat form with stealth and track humanoids. Feels like actually stalking prey. Stealthing when in line of sight and unstealthing to gain distance when behind cover.
---
I like the guys name on the bottom right
---
I'm a 36 fury warrior using sword/board to tank SM in Defensive Stance. I'm holding threat and have had maybe a total of 3 wipes in dungeons so far. Am I doing something wrong?
---
no useless debuffs comes from vanilla when taunt/sunder armor haven't been high prio and got kicked off by too much other debuffs/dots.
---
mortal strike still does damage even if the healing debuff gets kicked off.
---
how much and which debuffs have a high prior etc.. is still not confirmed as far as i know. but we had no problems on ragna with a few arms warries and shadowpriests.
---
that being said:
---
do what your raid lead tells you. nobody likes "unique flowers". and i already kicked my first unique flower before ragna for not doing what he has been told to.
---
Just keep leveling and the gold will come in soon enough.
---
I bought mine at 42 and at 45 i had another 90g
---
Damn even your pet's identity is protected. That's some fine dedication.
---
I will think there's 5 for RFC. Could be wrong. There's some from each of the capital cities. Sone can be shared so usually someone has some in the dungeon group. The big one is a short chain from Thrall that gives some decent gear.
---
There's a lot of quests in WC. The big ones are the ones from a hidden  abave above the entrance. Get someone to show you it can be a little tricky. One quest in there can award a nice bag. Also there's a chain starting at crossroads which ends with you killing some bosses inside and gives you some nice gear
---
Bigger pool of players to pull from as well. Easier to. Ake world pvp raids
---
Had a hunter blaming my lack of prot talents for not being able to hold aggro in Maura. Like come on I have no Rage and we fighting silencing lizards lol
---
what should rogues be opening with?
---
Lol I know it was a mistake.
---
A statue to chromie somewhere us the only change I support.
---
My bad. I assumed that it would work how it did in classic. This is good to know, thanks!
---
brb setting mine to your mom's house
---
Nice.
---
Make love not warcraft
---
Wowhead guides aren't good then. They just want traffic. None of this is new information so I'd imagine this author took creative liberties so it looks a little different from every other prot warrior guide. Fast weapons = faster rage = faster threat.
---
now you start saving up for the next mount, that will be 900g
---
Nice! Didn‘t see that before. Cool post bro!
---
And no flying has been amazing. The world feels huge. I feel like I'm on an adventure just going to each quest.
---
I dont even use the desktop app for classic. Just do /tsm scan once a day at the AH. Takes like 30 sec
---
Warrior gets infinitely more fun once you unlock your 31 point talent, rogues are about as fun as warriors but can be frustrating in their own ways too
---
I was grinding some quest mobs in STVietnam and there was an UD Priest grinding in the same area. I got overwhelmed and was close to dying and he jumped in and helped me kill the mobs. I /thanked him and he did a /wait. He Mind Controlled me just to buff me with Fort! We spent the rest of our time grinding and helping each other when needed! If you're on here Whisperes from Grobbulus RPPVP thank you!
---
Classic!
---
Just take the boat to menethil and fly back to ironforge. You automatically get IF FP as a dwarf/gnome so you should easily be able to get back.
---
Ugh back in TBC, being a clueless warlock starting out ... Soulstoned myself in a dungeon. I still cringe thinking about it.
---
In Vanilla, at least on KJ the consensus was need all BOE's, always. Simply because of ninjas, you learned real fast to prevent the opportunity. 
---
Coming into classic knowing about this mechanic is an opportunity to teach and help avoid that kind of frustration. I try to let others know about a potential BOEs when i know they could drop, however i could go further and make a macro explaining why you should need them.
---
Come to Incendius, closest to 50-50 full pop server  in EST
---
Pick Alliance! They have a great community and are a bit underpopulated so you'll make more gold off of AH.

You're asking for a 1.12 flight map - 1.12 is vanilla Wow.
---
Wow Classic is 1.13, not 1.12.
---
However, the flight maps didn't change between 1.12 and 1.13 so Leatrix Maps (Classic) is what you want.

There was no grinding whatsoever in my journey unless it was forced like a quest item that took forever (RFC medallion just outside org took me 20 minutes of grinding). I only ran dungeons once and it was when I had every quest for it, usually 4+ quests. I did a lot of zone hopping, a bit in Tarren Mill then back to Stonetalon then Ashenvale then back to Stone or Tarren etc. Questing was not a struggle as a rogue.
---
Yea but do you have the ss
---

When you take a photo with your phone instead of a screenshot 😭
---
if i get ganked by groups i usually dont have any problem finding other alliance to help me fight back, definitely feels more horde sided tho
---
To start a dungeon, you need to join a group and go into the physical entrance of the dungeon. You should be able to get help from other players if you ask, or look up where the entrance to the dungeon is.
---
i mean it does mean that sometimes too, usually with more s'es like psst
---
Yeah it's pretty BS to not even give you a warning
---
Trust me its not gonna change.. do yourself a favour and change.
---
i'm alliance on lakeshire ...
---
I don't think you can anymore.
---
Gets a lot better at 40.
---
I’m pretty sure they weren’t in til BC, which is why they’re not in the game now.
---
Did you find yourself vendoring the leather or selling on AH?
---
I wouldn't discuss subjects like the ones brought up by OP with strangers in a new guild.  Know your audience first.
---
He just wanted some of that elf booty
---
Except that some of us actually are, so it's a bullshit thing to use as an insult.
---
No! I must push through the unfun until it becomes fun again!!!!!!
---
Hail N'Zoth
---
What interface addon is this? Elvui?
---
Probably for every server but I really love hillsbrad wpvp
---
Nope. I looted them off of some of the undead mobs in northwest Duskwood.
---
Alliance on Blaumeux btw.
---
Look it up on wowhead, but generally if it's leftover after the quest/chain is completed, it's pretty safe to chuck.
---
Of course, there may be a few quest items that outweigh ever turning in their quest.
---
I don't know man, I feel like calling a low effort, pretty boring meme "perfect"(probably on the basis that it has Husseins face on it)  is politically charged. All I can do is fight back
---
Yes, that is what I would do. You'll be waiting a very long time to get pvp pieces as a prot warrior.
---
That goes against the very spirit of the game genre, we're supposed to be ~~murderhobos~~ adventurers hunting for epic loot, not accountants going over spreadsheets on how to maximise their ~~anal circumference~~ gold income and whatnot. Sure, there are people who find fun in that, and power to them for playing the game in whatever way they want, but it's not right for such a minority to expect the majority to conform to their view.
---
I feel the same with almost every Cata zone. It's just "hey it's the old zone but theres a *giant fucking hole in it**.* Got old real fast.
---
Based entirely on the one image from above...
---
"Humor is a male trait" carries the implication that women are devoid of it.
---
You don't find women funny.  That's fine.  A large part of comedy requires a person to relate to the comedian.  I would hazard a guess that men tend to find men funnier, and women find women funnier simply due to the shared experiences. 
---
The problem is that you have implied that women don't have humour.  Because you don't find it funny, it doesn't exist.  You are negating other peoples lived experience because of your personal preference.
---
You are looking at it from the perspective of a male and stating that the female position does not exist. 
---
I can imagine it being quite draining having to explain to somebody that you do indeed have humour.  It's a doomed conversation from the start.
---
Totally extremely viable at pvp.
---
A well played shadowpriest can take on just about any class.
---
Back in the day on Kul Tiras we had a shadow priest who was deaf, I don’t remember his name but we crossed paths from time to time, and he was well known on the server. Very very good at pvp, and took pride in killing players who were more geared than him.
---
Later on at 6 pvp definitely leans in favor of anyone who’s running AQ40 / Naxx
---
It's not about spreadsheet overthinking, you'll just notice over time. Doesn't take long once you're at 60 running dungeons for better gear and farming gold at the same time. It's not that you will or won't, it's actually fun so when you have to play with 4 other people you have to take into consideration about how the majority will think because you're playing a social game. The majority will want or eventually learn that selling a good boe outweighs the cost using it. Don't be selfish, classic is about community and gold actually does matter to a lot of players if not most and even you.
---
Indeed dude. It was fun to kill escorts, have people hunt on me, a lot of world pvp with a lot of corpses, people actually escorting and protecting stuff as opposed to just following it without any danger.
---
This is a good one
---
lmao. IF you say so.
---
Have fun being addicted to an organisation who creates a game with no end while you give them money.
---
That makes sense. I guess I'm just confused because the pic I posted is from the TSM blog, but I've never seen that when I run the client.
---
Lol thats how i feel as a level 60 on the boat.
---
Why do you deserve compensation when youre all doing equal work as a group?...
---
Literally wanted to cut it up and eat it.
---
Wait BGs won't be out for a year?
---
i was spamming TANK LFG MARA PRINCESS RUN. He shouldnt have messaged me in the first place
---
Yeah he probably added that sound himself, so much incentives for him to do that.
---
yea i was spamming LFG and World with TANK LFG MARA PRINCESS RUN
---
How was that post wrong exactly? And I'm pretty sure HS starts to push forward against mobs HIGHER lvl then you, not lower. I haven't heard about that being wrong
---
Who debunked it?
---
Gold please?
---
I'm absolutely torn between a warrior and druid. I have played both to 30 in hopes that I would figure out which one to go, however I'm stick between them and do not want to stifle my progress and would love some anecdotes and advice on which one to take to 60 first and main.
---
Halfway through Vanilla I started playing a druid and absolutely loved it. Was my main in tbc and wotlk (where I stopped playing). In vanilla though all I did was heal and pvp, in tbc and wotlk I raided as feral/healer and sometimes boomkin. Playing the druid is like putting on a pair of comfy shoes. It's great. I realize that in classic I'm pro ablutions going to be more of a healbot again and unlikely to tank anything more than ubrs.
---
I've never played a warrior before except a few times on the ptr during tbc and wotlk. They're very fun, and I am salivating to get mortal strike. I feel leveling and pvp will be waaaaay faster and more fun once I have another instant strike available. However there are a few times where I feel frustrated and want to just go back to the druid. 
---
I'm having difficulty with being just a healbot again in raids and being mediocre in pvp (cant explode people at 60 like a warrior can for example) as the druid. Having said that though, I know what I'm getting into and it's fun. Stealth runs of lbrs to get the key for ubrs are my fondest memories of wow. 
---
Whereas with a warrior theres a chance to be either the main tank or off tank in classic, and maybe make people explode in pvp?  I feel like the warrior doesnt offer nearly as much as the druid, which is giving me doubts.
---
Oh god please help.
---
How do you guys hit 60 so fast..
---

180 is enough to see a little bit of input lag
---
And people TALK! Wtf! People actually talk to eachother in dungeons and in the world, you often find groups just in /s talking to eachother about prices and everything. I love it.
---
After grinding in max lvl on retail, this is a breath of fresh air. Not even /bow emotes for help on world bosses.
---
Woah you just went full normie there
---
Woahhhhhhh.... The is is fake. Only horde gank.
---
FD+Trap is completely broken and never works in PvP atm. There seems to be a big delay beteen cast and actually dropping combat.

Try to delete it. If it says "deleting this quest item will delete the quest" then you know you shouldn't, but if the message doesn't come up, it should be safe to delete.
---
Yeah I think you're right there.

To the next instance.

Layering doesn't work that way.  Each layer is an entire continent, not individual zones.  They have been reducing the number of layers though, as they said they would.

We're fresh into phase 1 - the first BGs are slated to be available in phase 3. Blizzard has already completely screwed the game up for people who want to pretend to enjoy 2:1 WPvP zerg rushes for 6+ months

---
You don’t get invited by spamming channels that you’re lfg, you get invited by finding a group with an open DPS slot and asking them to join.
---
Does that still go for a phase shifted imp?
---
There’s only 200 level 60s? Or am I reading that wrong
---
Okey? You realise your anectodal experiance and "thoughs" regarding the faction balance holds no water against actual census? Sure, just how precise the census tool is could be debatable, but still..
---
We do live in a time where feelings are facts.
---
This is good except you will definitely want to put that 1 point into elemental mastery when you ding 40. Respec at 60.
---
I really dont give a shit about whats developed on private servers or the shitty attitudes of the players that came from them.
---
It's funny that this is the same on every server, apparently.
---
I ganked a shittone of people this morning, and it was fun, so I just kept doing it.

Best leveling method for a 22 alliance pally? I’m sorta hitting a wall right now because deadmines isn’t giving a lot anymore and the questing in redridge basically requires groups (which I don’t have)

They're gonna dodge by queueing at the exact same time and hoping 7 or 8 get the same game. Or they'll just queue with 4 because that's enough to roll a pug.

The way the system needs to work is you should get almost no honor for anything other than *beating full premades.*
---
oh wow. i stand corrected. been so long i thought it was out sooner.
---
The problem is probably less what your doing and more that most dps don't understand they are responsible for their own threat.

Damn. This feels super bad. Like.. on one hand, this is BiS for a class that should 100% equip. On the other, it's like, 1k gold and you can never *know* that player would equip. 
---
I'm always very inclined (when playing with friends) to always split money epics when farming. If one needs it to use, they get it for 50% that way everyone wins.

Yeah, can't blame the mage for winning, but ugh.. idk

Good point! It is a stupidly expensive  ability. This vid makes me wanna try making a prot warrior twink sometime.

How many oozes have you killed to get the bag? You won't think positively about wetlands when you have killed +50 of them

Just wanted to say my warlock is a blast to play. I had a shadow priest in vanilla but just low level, I didn't really play seriously until TBC. Shadow was fun but the warlock is amazing and having 0 downtime. I don't know that I've drank or eaten a single time.
---
Rogue is a blast too because I'm playing him only with a buddy. Have him pull aggro and then I do two backstabs and the mob dies. Haven't gotten out of barrens with him yet so no PvP, but looking forward to ganking filthy alliance scum.
---
Definitely skinning. You can skin other people’s kills. Letting skinable corpses fade is a terrible waste
---
KOS.
---
Well, the point is that it's for the community to decide on the rules, isn't it? And so far, at least from what i could see in this thread for example, the majority of people seem to favor the "need if you are going to use it, greed if sell" mindset.
---
That's the opposite of selfish, as you are trying to imply.
---
So unless your group establishes their own rules, that should be the default.
---
You chose a great class, hope you enjoy the game :)
---
Ok not sure what Kul Tiras is? A server? And the last sentence 60 PvP is 60 man raids!? And a shadow priest leans in favour of people who run AQ 40?? I recently learned naxx is some sort of difficult boss that isn't released yet.
---
Classic + Blizz should just give alliance Ogres w/ good pvp racial and you'll see better faction balance
---
Unavailable was unavailable for comments.....
---
Binds when equipped. Fair game for all.
---
Why don't you have a seat over there.
---
True. And I guess the horde will be more well known on with the community that pvp regularly because they will be seen more
---
I'm so tired of higher levels ganking you. Seems like the opposite faction only wants to gank you when they're higher level or in greater numbers. I know honor hasn't been implemented, but what happened to actual honor?
---
its unique, can only have one on your person
---
How did you abuse it?
---
What’s your question?
---
Ya unique items work like that. Bad luck sadly
---
You want to look and start getting generic +spell damage prebis items if you can. Yes, Immolate is still good. Drain life is less dps than shadowbolt, but more than wanding usually. But, it’s good for sustaining.  
---
I use Succubus solo and Imp in parties. Since I use darkpack, I use their mana as mine. I use imp passively for buffs unless I’m at a boss.
---
This was on Yojamba. A friend was in the auction house, but couldn't see it, so I invited him to bring him to my layer.
---
The scream on Discord as the dragon appeared above his head was priceless.
---
Assasination Daggers becomes better than Combat swords eventually for raids but iirc it wont be until a later phase you need a fair bit of gear for it to be better, but its not that far behind otherwise if you do want to swap at 60
---
Sure if you play a class that can aoe, chances are you’ve done it at some point to farm gear or exp. it’s pretty easy to find a group for any type of dungeon clear though
---
Sure, and it's a disorder that private server players had in the extreme.
---
They were good at it, and they were right, but it's not something I wanted to deal with and I'm glad it's toned down with classic.
---
Imagine getting this worked up about nothing.
---
Thank you my friend!
---
No lol Someone posted the level splits earlier and levels 1-20 are the most popular still because of people rerolling and trying out each class. You can get to level 20 in less than a day of /played so you will always, always find people in starting zones and beyond.
---
Yup.  Stastically, about half of all tauren players are druids.
---
That was some beautiful play.
---
I'd love to know what ui add-ons you are using. Very clean layout and I like that combat text and chat are separated.
---
Swap layers instead of waiting for respawn
---
In PvE? Pretty sure Ele would be the better pick seeing as how they do more consistent damage rather than the RnG wind fury proc, which albeit can be big, but gotta keep relying on that RnG.
---
Resto on the other hand can be really strong and there’s always at least 1 resto shammy in a raid, the utility totems have are too good
---
I don't know if that word exists tbh. I just assumed this would be how you make a verb/adjective out of puberty. English isn't my main language so I often just kinda throw stuff together and see whether it looks right or not.
---
Only took about a dozen haha
---
Perhaps, but OP has cut the picture short so we can't actually see what they wrote.  This doesn't predispose me to take their corner.
---
"Men use comedy to get laid" is fine.  They probably do.
---
"Humour is a male trait" does not mean the same thing.

If the pattern was BOP then it would be ok.

Honestly if your group is full of decent people, they should let you have priority on it, but greed gets the better of people sometimes.

How is speccing demon for leveling? Im currently specced afflict and liking it but feel like im playing it wrong.
---
The elementals in arathi highlands drop charms that warriors need for their 30 quest. The charms can go for 1g or so on the AH and drop pretty frequently. Also, desolace has really good value for quest rewards.
---
Shouldnt be necessary in 1.12.1, so hopefully not in classic as well
---
I got to level 30 on my warrior, gave up on him and rerolled priest. Way more fun for me. My skills actually do something, I don't need to whore myself out for gear and I can mind control ppl off cliffs. I know the warrior will become more fun after whirlwind axe and mortal strike but I thought: why grind through 10 more levels of pain when I can have fun with priest right away?
---
Who's worked up?
---
I'm just sat on the toilet and have time to type.  I had a firecracker kebab for dinner that is turning my insides.
---
is this an addon?
---
I could see it working well enough with a controller. Move with analog stick, other for camera and the rest of the buttons you can keybind to anything you want. LT could work like a shift button or RT could work like a ctrl button that can you can combine with other buttons on the controller for even more keybinds.
---
And thank God I was. Got through STV, Hillsbrad, and Shimmering Flats only seeing a few Horde that were 3-4 lvls below me anyway.
---
Or eat the lion meat before you got back to Halas.

---
VanasKOS has been redevelopped for classic and works really fine
---
On retail i understand that desire for a 1v1 but on classic the matchups are so lopsided it doesn't really matter.
---
Ugh, Alliance propaganda.
---
Friends list
---
No what you did was be passive aggressive towards half the player base. And then being annoyed when people got snippy.
---
Really? You are gonna recommend a mac to someone who needs advice on what kind og laptop he should get? You are just evil.

What add on for the player and target frames ?
---
I saw a few going for just under 1k on Bloodsail yesterday.
---
Eating his corpse at the end was so satisfying to watch lol.
---
i mean its not going to be good at 60 except at healing in raids. Enh and ele are both good in pvp though
---
Wait, just 500 from neutral to exalted? That doesn't sound right. I've probably looted close to 200 between leveling 50-60. 500 doesn't sound like much at all.
---
If they somehow make classics release cannon that would be sick, time travel is even a thing so it's possible.

You should have no problem finding groups for dungeons. As for raids, it just depends on who is running the raid.
---
Two quick questions:
---
-how to increase bank space? (Playing horde)
---
- just reached 225 tailoring and can't find the trainer to increase my skill capacity. Anyone know where to go?
---
Holy Paladin in Legion and BFA.  Druid in Classic. I don’t want to be a buff machine in Classic and Feral is a more viable off tank than Prot Pally. Plus shape shifting is fun! I don’t like how retail Druid’s have to pick one play style.
---
Something to consider:  let’s say you’re going to spend 20 hours playing in the next week. 
---
- You can spend that 20 hours grinding mobs for trash loot getting you your mount by 40. 
---
- You can spend 20 hours doing efficient leveling at different quest hubs. You get your mount by 41 or 42. 
---
If it still costs you 20 hours playtime till you literally have the mount in-hand, would you rather be 40 or 42?
---
There are some people I wouldn't call friends but I def owe them one.
---
As someone who didnt play retail and quit after TBC.  Is this not what retail is like?  Are there no populated cities?
---
Blizzard doesn’t get to choose.
---
Iran makes its own policies
---
Dark Souls just taught me to Git Gud. Surely applies here
---
On your server, perhaps. People ninja lesser things
---
Best guess is focus on the dungeons/raids and then tune it so we could go to hellfire peninsula at 45ish.   That way you could level in outlands if you wanted.
---
I am torn between a rogue and Druid for what I want to commit to getting to 60 and making my main. I have leveled both to 20 and don’t want to commit any further without being sure about what class I want to play. 
---
I really want the option to have some fun in WPVP but my main focus is going to be raiding.
---
500 turnins. It's 20 runecloth per turnin. Also, when I hit 60 I was 6000 into honored, so 27k rep missing.
---
So add them and put a note ( if you can do that )
---
I wish they did them for bf1 me and my buddy still quote battlefield friends to this day. “Hey guys I’m a MAV!!!!”
---
Well the NSA was spying so... Why not?
---
Greetings from France and Mulgore !
---
I wish you the best of luck and never forget : as gamers we don't have borders, we are one.
---
Maybe you do
---
As warrior man i tank with daggers, the rage generation with slow weapons is horrible.
---
The slow weapon myth is because in the off hand a slow weapon have better chances to hit, also because in main have abilities hit hard
---
But a warrior without rage dont have abilities to use, a rogue or hunter in another hand
---
I started a new hunter just before 40, I'm having fun with him, he's easy to level, and his skinning is making me mad dollars.
---
Sounds fun. Let’s do it. What realm?
---
You’re doing dungeons with the wrong people chief
---
What’s the add on you have over your gear that shows the item level and such?
---
I would not want to be an ally on Lakeshire, that's for sure.
---
Guess this explains why I can't relate when people make posts talking about how being Horde on PvP servers is ez-mode... I've always felt like it was pretty balanced, and I guess for me it is.
---
My small brain can't handle this
---
If you're alliance, yes.  =D
---
What UI suite are you using ?

Nah, hidden reroll gives to next winner.

Cats absolutely,  they go through roughly 1 MCP per boss. It's actually absurd
---
Usually 2-3 MCP will get a bear through a raid though, and often you wont need it, Maul generates an obscene amount of threat
---
Yeah imo herbalism and mining is a bad combo in classic, since you can only track one of them

Keybind both find minerals and find herbs and switch them after every mob, or constantly as you’re running. If you’re not doing this there’s not much point to having them both.
---
I did not know how good it was. I probably still dont but I appreciate it way more now. Glad they gave me a second chance with classic. Having an absolute blast. More fun this time through for sure.
---
Looks like you was asleep.

yup

Interesting... maybe that’s my issue. I currently have the macro keybinded to a mouse button. Changing that tonight, thank you!
---
I really gotta turn on shadowplay to grab some footage of me reverse ganking rogues. Had two rogues on me yesterday that obviously are either geared bad or can't play the class cause after getting cheap shotted, I took them both out. Only to be reamed by a warrior right after.
---
scattered all over the world all glory is lost

F.
---
What a detailed post.. Hope they change it back to the right way. #justiceforwarlockinfernalsanddoomguards

Undead water breathing is legit in situations like this. Run to water and swim down "Chase me if you want" then drown them after they over commit lol.
---
They're also working to prevent the subreddit descending into nothing but utter low effort bullshit.  They're putting in work to make a better space.  Maybe be a little appreciative?

Hey mate, just wanted to hear from you - did you find what of it works in classic so far? I'm very upset to find that killing escort NPCs is not a thing anymore :(
---
The repository for weakauras is the website wago.io
---
Definately start there on your weakauras journey. Doing stuff with range is going to require pulling data with Lua code, I'm not at that level but maybe someone has already made one and put it up there.
---
This content is so watered down that any spec is viable even shadowpriest taking debuff slots
---
Rogues get 2 AP from Agi.
---
Anis are so fucking expensive it's not worth taking until like 50+ when you make one ankh back when selling drops.
---
This isn't due to Iranian policy, it's due to USA policy imposing sanctions.
---
Reduce the render distance setting, that's one of the most intensive out of the settings, it makes an effect on immersion for me, but reducing it should seriously reduce the strain on your laptop.
---
 I wish everyone had updated models. I love classic but the new models fromretail are much better.
---
Just wanted to come back and thank everyone for the tips and discussion. Was a little nervous to get flamed and appreciate the help.
---
Druid here, I've killed ton's of locks. I fought one good one that death coiled me, every other one regretted putting a dot on me. Most locks dont fear correctly making it really really easy.
---
Let’s say you’re doing a dungeon and you find a rare blue that’s BoE in example a lvl 19 item that’s a Twink item, does it look bad to NEED on such a valuable item because of the insane worth it has even though it doesn’t pertain to your certain class or needs.
---
I remember back in the day when I found out about this dagger I started farming it like crazy.
---
I must have farmed that dungeon almost a hundred times and it never dropped.
---
Told my friend about it and he figured he’d give it a try....he got 2 drops in 4 runs.
---
Holy overreaction.
---
No they do not.

This addon will color your abilities red on your action bars if you’re out of range.
---
Is that an addon you're using for durations on the debuffs? Mine don't do that, and I haven't seen an interface option to turn that on.
---
Warlock again, but switched to alliance instead of horde to appease my wife. 
---
Undercity will always be my real home though.
---
its like being a level higher when fighting others mobs in terms of misses and glancing blows which is pretty huge
---
What's the add-on called?
---
The jumping around like he was on fire made a good laugh.
---
I see a limit of 48 attack power.
---
I'm particularly interested in knowing the addon you use for quests tracking
---
While it's not worth it for him to level skinning now, skinning from lvs 40+ are the *most* profitable
---
Do you have a copy of the macro? I’m terrible at macros but I’d love to make something like this.
---
Yes it does
---
UI hidden, actual screenshot...
---
You lost friend?
---
That’s illegal
---
You need a fast weapon for smoother rage generation. If you miss an attack with a 2.7 speed you have to wait almost 3 seconds to generate threat with rage. That’s almost 3 seconds where your threat isnt moving and your dps are doing their thing
---
Also spy, which is hands down the best.
---
Why is there a silver dragon around your character frame?
---
Don't do content you don't enjoy buddy. Ravager has a unique position as a spectacular aoe weapon and that's about it. If you intend to dungeon spam you might want to farm for it. Mograines might isn't spectacular due to the stats and wpn speed, but it works well enough. If you like dungeons well enough I'd suggest heading into Uldaman at 44 and see if you can get the axe. Alternatively Maraudon around 48.
---
Slick, thanks man!
---
I could’ve sworn at one point in early WSG the brackets were like 11-20, 21-30, and ect.
---
I could be wrong, maybe it was just a few occasions where people leveled during their BG queues.
---
At which time period in the lore?
---
You don't, if you get a shit pet name on warlock you reroll.
---
MonkeyBuddy, I have customised it a bit

Submitted a bug report for warlocks sake. I'm a mage and rogue player, but that just sounds like the fun police at work.

Typical blizzard last few years unfortunately.
---
Can't tell if sarcastic or not but Iran is the number one sponsor of terror in the world. Whether it's the Beirut Bombing, seizing foreign investments in their country, funding and training terror groups during Operation Iraqi Freedom or backing a Palestinian government which pays Palestinians injured or killed trying to murder Israelis Iran is simply the most dangerous country in the world.
---
The rest of the world doesn't hate Iran for no reason, the IRGC is a straight up terror group who has been drilling and funding terror cells the world over for decades. Iran can go fuck itself.
---
The fact that the chromie nameplate is slightly off symmetry wise in relation to the hunters nameplate is tilting lol
---
Japanese and Korean architecture look similar and when used as a reference for fantasy architecture it can be hard to tell which was the inspiration. But based on the fact that nelf areas sell Korean clothes (like hanboks and dangui) and Korean food (Iike Kimchi stew) I think it's safe to say Korea was a pretty strong influence as well. Korean culture also practiced nature based shamanic rituals which I guess might have been a tie in for the nelves since they are also very nature-y.
---
Aren't people.abusing layers to get any item in timers.
---
Looks a bit...complicated, but I'll try and take a look.
---
And yeah, it's great for questing, with minion 'n stuff
---
That sounds pretty cool. Thanks for the info.
---
Or Ratchet. There aren’t any guards or anything!
---
No. I would ask you the same but that's just unfair for retarded people.
---
Yeah. I think I'll just forget about ravager. I was getting really burned out on running SM and getting a lot of assholes in groups. In Uldaman is it an axe or a mace? I thought I remembered the final boss dropped a super good mace.
---
Does anyone have a link to a website or spreadsheet that shows all the food effects for all foods.  I've tried googling but the only links i can find are for endgame.  I'm really looking for a complete list, hopefully sorted in some fashion (wowhead list is a mess to sift through).  Any help greatly appreciated. Cheers.
---
Eh. No warlock build is garbage for wpvp. Warlocks are just godlike with soul link. And white squishy without. Use food buffs, keep healthstone up. Keep voidwalker out until you hit 40 imo, or use succubus if you fear 2v1s.
---
All rogues do a large amount of instant attacks, so all rogues want as slow an offhand as they can get, even if its only 2.0 on daggers. 
---
It makes a big difference for your overall dmg output because a fairly big proportion of your dmg is from instant attacks, even if the majority will be white damage.
---
By the time you put up SnD, you'll have made 5 instant attacks for combo points, so yeah.
---
Dude it’s going to be like 6 months at most.
---
Some youtuber did a video on items not too long ago. They mentioned the drop rate for this sword. If I remember correctly it was something like. 07% drop rate.
---
Eh,  you're probably  right.   What  do i   know?  Any chance  they released the code for WoW? I  guess if they did,  we  can  check.
---
Label your axes!

back in the day i would get 2k hp on my 19 hunter it was beautiful
---
I’m one of the 10 players on judgement AMA
---
 Rookie mistake :D
---
I've come to the conclusion that wow players are the least funny demographic on the internet.
---
Does deep wounds stack or refresh if I get a 2nd Crit?
---
lol you're my better half i had one week of wow before school started and got to lvl 40. im now lvl 55. what is self control? idk but you seem to have way more of it than me. im not even trying to rush im just trying to play tf out of it
---
No one can tell the future. BGs won't be out for awhile.
---
I would say probably yes, though.
---
I believe you're right Uldaman might be a mace, I think I passed on it as I went resto about then.
---
Is there any alternative to corpsmaker as a lvl 32 shaman?
---
Did rfk 6 times already and sick of it. Still using the blue wc staff. Just need something to get me to 40 before i switch to elemental.

Welcome to the life of a full pop server.

Yeah and this is why I think it’s time to start a new toon. I love druid, but if I have to go into Gnomeregan 15 times a week I’ll end up manually crowd pummelling my own head against my keyboard.
---
This is amazing. Thank you
---
Is there no way to "powerlevel"? Wife hates early levels but enjoys 40+ and I'm about to hit 60. Please skip the "slow down and enjoy it type comments, I'm strictly looking for answers whether it's possible or not.
---
Yes we call people like that a ninja- short for selfish asshole
---
How would you feel if your class had broken moves that don't work as they are supposed to?
---
Yeah I'm ultimately on Stalagg because I joined a group who rolled a guild on there and I figured it'd be fun.
---
If that falls through or they decide to hop I'll probably just go move my character over to a PvE or RP server to chill.
---
Looking at these stats really bummed me out. I've spent a lot of time lvling alliance characters on Skeram only to see the 30/70 split on that server
---
It was from A warlock addon uuuh. Necrosis iirc
---
I felt the same way when i first started, youll get the hang of it look up guids, read websites, youll be fine
---
As a druid you will likely be healing for end game raids.
---
Rogues provide some of the best raid melee dps in the game.
---
They can both stealth and therefore are both great for WPVP.
---
Ohh. I remember that addon. Thanks!
---
I just switched out herbalism for mining at level 37. I couldn't sell any herbs for shit, but on my server mithril was going for like 1g per five mithril.
---
unless blizzard is aiming for some mega servers i dont see how they are going to remove layers before phase 2. they seemed to really mess up with the 10k  server caps.
---
Go to STV and grab some jungle remedies or the ah and get some free action potions and it should be a breeze to 1v1 any class after 40. Jungle remedy for rogue poison mostly and free action is obvious other than that engineering for stun bombs helps alot. After that not much more than using cooldowns properly.
---
How are the queues right now? 
---
I'd like to give wow a try (never played it before) but hearing about multiple hour queues is keeping me back from trying it right now.
---
Nobody cares. If youre leaving just go. Unless...
---
Oh shit hold up we got a genius
---
It's called worthless because iLvL isn't at all representative of the quality of the item for your spec/ class in vanilla.
---
How dare you have an adult conversation.
---
Nah, it's far worse than anything after vanilla. You'll find out I guess!
---
Someone uploaded bad/troll data or some very outdated info regarding Faerlina that has players from the first few days that quit. The alliance population went up 20,000 yesterday on Faerlina on the site.
---
I've been running census scans on both horde and ally the past week or so at various times of the day.
---
I've scanned approx 20,000 alliance and 24,000 horde that have been active during that time.
---
At peak times with a queue there are approx 6500 horde players online and 5200 alliance. Server size seems to be around or slightly below 12,000
---
Duskwood is good. A lot of skeletons and zombies.  
---
Also you don't need to "have a group". Just wait and in chat someone will write "LFM Elite quests". Whisper them and you would be invited. Or just write in chat "LFG Elite quests"
---
Remember - LFM = Looking for man. LFG = Looking for group.
---
Wow what a constructive response!
---
There really is no way for you to help her level outside of following her around ungrouped and killing the things she tags, which is janky and cumbersome.
---
I hope youre a mage and they are melee.
---
Everything else will become more expensive, that's not exactly how it works. Lots of things are incredibly cheap right now compared to the future because gold is worth more at the moment, there is less inflation of currency and less gold exchanging hands. Not many people are lvl 60 spam farming dungeons yet, probably only 2% of the playerbase. Eventually everyone will be 60, everyone will be adding 50g to the economy every day or so, rather than 5g currently.
---
That’s not a Druid form, lol, but yes. It’s because you’re invulnerable during it, not the same as shape shifting.
---
There are good leveling guides on https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.php for if you just want to level as fast as possible.
---
Go get a swamp jaguar from swamp of sorrows. Level 37, 1.2s attack speed and knows dash.

TSM is for advanced economy. I only use TSM when buying new bags, because it group all types into bulks.

A large chunk of WoW's world PVP is just griefing/trolling to be honest. A game that allows max level 60 characters kill a player 50+ levels lower than them with no penalties or blocking is going to have lots of it.
---
Just because bgs arent in the game yet doesnt mean they completely messed the whole game up
---
Love the other horde just running past
---
Feral would have to be able to kill Kill another class to get a flag back
---
Here is the thing, consider the likelyhood of you getting an epic mount (still playing x amount from now) and how good it is having an epic mount AND the pet :)
---
Wait until phase 2 and your comment will be "I regret choosing Kromcrush. Overpopulated huge queues." If your server has a queue then it's overpopulated.
---
Yeah, but to summon something, you need to first know its name. Otherwise, you can just summon something... well, something very bad. Look what happend to Kel'Thuzad
---
Not sure what level you folks were but I solo'd those as a shadow priest. Equal level or one level lower than the elites. Definitely fun.
---
Sarg and stormrage were pve servers and are alliance heavy
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=classic+wow+battlegroups+confirmed
---
First off, I have my epic  mount (which I paid 900g for) because I know how to farm. Secondly, I did not abuse layering, I'm just a nerd and I play a lot. You should direct your anger towards mages that abused layering to AoE farms. We Warlocks can't do that. You'll be the first one I come for when my infernal gets fixed.
---
I can wait and fish all day!
---
Do you hate then because they don't save lives? What do you do?
---
I wonder where those stats come from and if the country that determined that was accurate had armed and funded jihadists to over throw someone else's country or not.
---

Isn't that a UK Gambling Warning placed on every advert? lmao
---
A hunter needs pet food to keep their pet happy so as to improve their performance.
---
A caster needs water to replenish mana.
---
A hunter doesnt rely on other players providing food for them.
---
A caster shouldnt rely on another player providing water. 
---
A mage providing you with water is a nice gesture, but it's stupid to assume that they definitely are going to provide it and, as a result, not carry enough at all times for your drinking needs.

Thoughts on polls at every bank like OSRS? Adding content only if it has 80% support? Setting barriers to vote count based on level and time played. I would like to think we have learned from our mistakes. Plus it's not like we would have to make up the content. We would just guide Blizzard with our voices and agency in the progression of the game.
---
You can't run dungeons for rep. You turn in the runecloth for 50 rep per 20 cloth.
---
At the great lift I was having so much lag that the horde lowbies were straight up 'evade' ing the mind control spell sometimes. I don't know if this is a byproduct of layering or if it's just them trying to put restrictions on the spot, but it seemed to work better at certain spots than others.
---
"Evolutionary advantages"

Get fucked weirdo.
---
I'm sorry, is this a low level joke I'm too high level to understand?

You did nothing wrong
---
Shamans are way OP
---
The attack power on these gloves add up to 48. The item sells for 48s to a vendor. Coincidence? I think not.
---
WoW Classic 1.13.2 is based roughly on Vanilla WoW 1.12 (the one-dot-twelve patch). They simply artificially removed content and items to gate them into Classic phases.
---
They are not using any earlier patches as reference.
---
People went bananas over bear tanks in BC, I'm not really sure why, because they really didn't gain all that much from Vanilla.
---
&gt; Feral Swiftness (2/2): Increases dodge by 4% in Dire Bear Form
---
&gt; Survival of the Fittest (3/3): Reduces crit chance by 3% and increases stats by 3%
---
&gt; Improved Leader of the Pack (2/2): Heals for 4% of health upon critical hit
---
Those are the buffs Feral got in BC.  I think itemization did more to help feral than any talent changes did.  Nobody really questioned bear tanks in BC, and when they argue about it now they think that its because of some massive sweeping changes the spec got in 2.0, which just isn't the reality.
---
That said, Prince hit really fucking hard if you were in preraid blues, even if you were a warrior, lol.  That fight was more about non tanks not taking avoidable raid damage so your healers could just keep your tank up.
---
ahahah, EL CLASSICO!
---
Yeah because Blizzard totally went back and redid all the models for Classic.  
---
Genius
---
&gt; How much should I balance out money-making and just leveling? I’ve been going and learning new shit from tutors at every chance, so it’s not like I’m being stingy with the money, either. I just wanna make sure I can buy a mount at 40.
---
70-80% of all gold you will get from doing quests. So good strategy - do quests a lot)  
---
Currently there' no way to "earn" money from other players, because they also don't have this money. They also trying to gather gold for a mount, to buy all skills, etc.
---
Dont worry dude, they woulda ran ahead and pulled the whole room anyway without giving you a chance to aggro.
---
that must be the coolest gnome name ever
---
Classic is cross realm. All queues will be the same for every sever.
---
Is there a written guide you're following? I'd love to level a warrior alt and this made me so interested
---
Sometimes I wish I had rolled human for RP stuff like this. Or even a Dwarf or Gnome would know about Terenas.
---
As a Night Elf it would feel out of place to pay respects when we spent the past 1,000 years on Kalimdor without any contact to Lorderon.
---
Make sure your void walker's taunt ability is enabled (default: right click). If it is still a problem, maybe let VW damage him for 1 global cool down and then start damage. It's worth it to wait the extra second to ensure VW has aggro rather than bursting your target and taking aggro immediately
---
is there an add-on that lets you know if an item is better for you than the ones you're wearing?
---
&gt; but in pvp is it possible to be **competitive** without constantly switching to your default race form and casting wrath/moon fire etc?  
---
I can relate to this.  I never have enough food and cheer when something edible drops.  Pull hope it’s only 1 guy, get 2 barely live, eat, loot, repeat.  It’s brutal.
---
Nah BoEs are destined to be forever sold and passed around by players, never ever to be equipped for eternity.
---
That site keeps popping up an annoying message about adblock being enabled and resetting everything, is there a better site?
---
He mentioned somewhere else that it took around 500 turnings of cloth, meaning it took about 10 000 Runecloth. In my mind that is pretty ridiculous amount
---
Is it worth sticking with my druid alt? I got him to lvl 13 and I'm... Really not digging it. Dps is bad. Bear form is a bit of a help, but it plays like a weird warrior. Outside of bear form my dps is bad and despite my heals I don't feel like I have much survivability.
---
I'm assuming it does get a lot better at lvl 20 with cat form?
---
I'm horde on Stalagg and Grizzly is cross faction colluding with horde guilds for devilsaur leathers. It's fucked, I'm going to make a post about it shortly. A lot of us on the server are trying to right against it and camp grizzly members as hard as possible. Pieces of shit man!
---
You can pay for a good leveling guide on https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.php. It will do all the thinking for you and all you have to do is follow the steps to 60. It's a lot faster than just using Questie but it IMO it takes all the game out of the game. Still, it's the closest thing I know to powerleveling.
---
&gt;Plays game intended to recreate the way things were in 2005
---
&gt;Bitches about things being the way they were in 2005
---
My main from wotlk to wod was feral, I changed to pally main after that to current retail.  I went druid because there is no option for paladin on horde, the obvious superior faction.
---
LOL Relatable :/
---
Fixed!

I wish I had it on video. I am 5/5 in the talent that reduces resist chance, and I had to cast fear around 5 times to land 2 of them. I had to spam some dots for a couple of times for them to hit. And I had to pot+HS to have health for lifetaps to keep my mana up.
---
Still I think I was incredibly lucky with the first fear landing. That won me the fight 100%, since I had all the time to spam dots and try to recast fears.
---
Could you share your TUKUI profile? I'd like to have the same as yours!
---
I do lol he's level 6 loyalty don't be so quick to judge
---
Trying to convince my guild to transfer , wish me luck
---
I did it with my partner when we were both 22, used the mace until like 32 so I'd say it's definitely worth it.
---
As a fellow melee, I too hate it when I get rooted.
---
It's really hit or miss with me. Some of the zones I feel were a huge improvement like the Plaguelands, the Barrens, and Desolace. Then you get other zones like Thousand Needles, Loch Modan, and Azshara which I felt were ruined by the redesign.
---
The +4 defense doesn't apply
---
Not sure what level you folks were but I solo'd those as a shadow priest. PWS + proper fear timing is OP. Definitely fun.

Shoulda rolled 62 harder.
---
Orcs remind me more of native Americans
---
i wonder how often his coworkers kept mixing up his name
---
If you play Druid you have to be totally comfortable with using all of your abilities at your disposal. If you just want to go cat and not do anything else, then you’re literally just surrendering the other 75% of your character.
---
I have to remember this. I just took a 2 day-long break because I was feeling frustrated (level 28, had trouble finding a zone to quest in that was also fun, and felt annoyed by the level grind). Got my groove back today. It's good to step back for a bit to recharge.
---
oh i bet he does daddy
---
He don't get any flag bacc for another 6+ months -_-
---
I off tanked everything up to aq40 as a fury spec and never once specced prot for the entire vanilla experience
---
Oh yeah. I use 3 heals, 1 flash and 1 renew. Just feel out how fast the tank takes damage throughout the dungeon and it's all groovy.
---
If it had to be done, best to do it that way. Max level accounts only, etc etc
---
There is but that is not this. That’s only through /roll not actual party rolls like need and greed.
---
If you're talking about questing, then yeah I usually used heroic strike when my rage got up there. In dungeons you should be sundering for the threat generated without losing auto attacks (you don't gain rage on yellow attacks, ie heroic strike). Use battle shout and demoralizing shout to generate threat on mobs you aren't attacking but that might still get pulled off you by heals or whatever.
---
Not for hunters I don't think, I believe Agi only gives Melee attack power if you are cat and rogue?
---
Yep! They put it on all of those adverts because it's extremely good advice ;)
---
Idk man I guess you’re not looking very hard, I have had 0 trouble immediately getting into groups whenever I want as a rogue.
---
Huh that's very interesting from the other perspective. Horde side has a few guilds but I agree it's a very casual server. We didn't have any player getting to 60 in the first week to my knowledge and I think we're just getting to a point where there's enough 60s to run a raid.
---
As for personal experience while leveling (I'm now approaching 55), I notice more alliance out in the contested zones than horde. Some of the more common group/farm areas were heavily camped by alliance groups and slowed down my questing quite a bit.
---
I noticed up front that there was a tremendous bias to people wanting to play on PVP servers. I have almost zero interest in PVP but before release I started making plans to have a 2nd character on a PVP server anyway. After some of my friends decided to play PVE, and I was a proponent for this, I started having second thoughts and tried to sway them to a pvp server but they didn't bite. I will probably make that 2nd character in a couple weeks still just in case.
---
in b4 all the alliance on Stalagg transfer and it becomes a Horde only pve realm
---
This is heartwarming and saddening at the same time.
---
They didn't. They said their intentions were to remove it asap with phase 2 as a backstop.
---
This is in desperate need of some nu-metal from 2004 and bad editing on the crits.

That weapon is awful, even as a 39 twink weapon. You want PoD for 39. Doubt you'll get 160g.
---
I read somewhere holy shield is really mana intensive. I think I'll try with cons and BoS. Just got to get some plate to wear. And a shield spike.
---
If you pick a low-medium population server when you create your character you'll most likely never see a queue.
---
Bruh, Ive plqyed the game for three expansions and quit.  Tried every expo and quit cause it was boring. You're legit being retarded. Firstly. because the video is like a fucking parody of metal music calling out satan. Secondly because if the game's enjoyable you dont need any. manipulation. Thirdly, the fucking messages in that video are lol. You dont know how any aort of hipnosis or sub messaging work if you think thats gonna work.
---
Wyrmthalak eu with naar 100% alliance?
---
I think it’s because they don’t know how to use their auction app correctly.
---
Eh.
---
At that level, Stamina is probably more useful for the Warlock, especially since he can tap for more mana + drain for more health.
---
If there were other casters in the group (Mage / Priest) then I completely understand why he'd pass on it.
---
It's only scanning characters that are logged in though. Certainly the are alts in the data, but it's probably not many.
---
Yea...thinking I'm finished learning useless white gear with medium leather...nope they're just more expensive white gear to make..
---
I just started classic today and noticed the server I joined, Herod, seems to be horde dominate at around 65/35. For a more balanced experience, should I reroll now while I’m still low level or should those stats not be counted on. I pve and PvP with more focus on PvP.
---
Yeah pugging it was fine, I’m talking about how he said hunters weren’t taken even though they were extremely strong DPS and very useful for kiting away the add.
---
First class I ever played was warlock, once I got Max level and realised I was the world's worst warlock I rerolled hunter.
---
I was in two minds about which class to roll for classic
---
I was 27 and made a gnome mage alt for my daughter who was three at the time, used to play with her on my lap.  Mostly tailoring, trying things on, and polymorphing things into sheep and then every other critter when I found the polymorph tomes.  Now she’s in college and might end up in WoW Classic on her own.

Share your talent distribution?
---
They were, don't remember when that got changed but I think we will get 10-19 brackets already.
---
Anyone know if this is possible with other professions?
---
this whole argument is based on mages not wanting to provide summoned water to the group, and was in fact, trying to charge for it!!
---
Hunters have never asked mages for summoned, anything.  
---
So again, WTF does a hunters pet food have anything to do with this argument?!
---
What addon are you using for the bags? Looks neat.
---
Idk why people are calling Heartseeker a  "dead server." Its actually at a great spot. I know all the guilds, I never have a problem finding groups, the economy is starting to pick up rather nicely. And most of all- when I want to play, I get on and play, and I get off when I want to without fear of not being able to get back on.
---
Fuck the queues, I'm done with that.
---
Yeah it’s honestly sad lol
---
What's the best moonwell to access as a horde to farm mooncloth?
---
Yeah, I've seen some wierd drops. Unfortunately I only have screenshots of me wearing it, but not obtaining it.
---
I have that on retail — killed pirates for DAYS for it.
---
I mean farmed staff of Jordan?
---
Your method doesn't use less Mana. It uses less Mana per point healed. You might not need to heal for that full amount, meaning that you will have overhealed and wasted Mana from your already more expensive Mana cost.
---
Potion seller, I want only your strongest potions, I'm going into battle.
---
Oh, that's true.
---
It's been reasonable with tailoring. Slight loss or slight profit on a lot of stuff.
---
Just gotta fill your bags with that gnomer mace lol
---
This might be my new favorite post. Not THAT funny, just really fucking tickled me this afternoon
---
I walked over your dead body yesterday or the day before, I cant remember. Haha
---
I don't use it for the ilvl. I use it to see my stats on the side because the standard interface is lacking.
---
Or you are on a pvp server and opportunity knocked on you hard.
---
Honestly ive only had 1 dps not understand anything about classic but a majority understand tank needs a second or 2 to get solid aggro.
---
Nice timing for sure. You should have rotated some wanding at the end in that scenario to speed up the kill and maximize satisfaction.
---
I should have never rolled a warrior. It's been a miserable nightmare. Finally hit 40 but can't afford my mount. Really wish I rolled a Paladin.
---
R/inclusiveor
---
False, false, false, and more lies. You dont need to be a mage to aoe farm and layer for exp grind. You're a fucking layering as a miner. DUH
---
This was me the other day.  Ten Horde piled onto the boat.  Some skull and others similar level as me (mid-40s) and just like *whistling* as I'm looking around.
---
It's a huge pain in the ass quest line, but that mace can carry you into your 40's so it is absolutely worth it. Try to get one component a day, that's it. That's not so bad!
---
Alch and herb is killer for leveling. You add heals as a 2 minute cooldown.
---

My warlock friend had just learnt their Inferno spell, so naturally went off to Shadowglen to show it off to everybody. We were incredibly disappointed  when it just decided to despawn! I really, really hope that this is a bug/oversight and not just intended game design. We both bugreported, and I'd suggest @'ing the WarcraftDevs twitter account directly about this as well, in addition to bugreporting and posting on the forums.
---
Straight up out played that dude. Well done, very satisfying to watch.
---
But that would mess everything up, too, and why would anyone ever choose to level in the Plaguelands when they can go to Nagrand, for example?
---
If you have people willing to help, yes. If you don't, no.
---
But if you get to mid 30's/early 40's you can solo it and it may still be an upgrade
---
Staff of Jordan dropped for me during leveling! At 42. I replaced it earlier today with Witchblade + Aquamentas though.
---
What’s worth more having a sword at lvl 19 that has lost all worth when u equip or have a extremely high economy to not have to worry abt money for a long time. I think you’re the selfish one for taking a lvl 19 item that you will EASILY out level.
---
Is there an add on which highlights important white items? Things like sharp claws etc?
---
If by real you mean items, gold, xp, then no. But I will take any excuse to get out of the Thousand Needles
---
If you're talking about the upper body movement for the character, WoW's models seem to be split into different skeletal joints in a sense... the upper-half does the movements as normal for combat while the bottom is fixed to the mount. The models seem to be built in such a way to make such flexibility possible, despite it sometimes causing some clipping or looking a bit goofy.
---
Sure that's why i was advertising for only princess runs, people who want to do full runs should look for another tank
---
This is really great info, any good sources or more tips on leveling as prot? I leveled a paladin prot in BC and even though it was slow I loved taking on 3-4 mobs and just out lasting them over time but no one talks about leveling as anything but Arms for speed or Fury for the fun/pvp/dps
---
Lok tar! Not until they stop counting those dirty freeloading goblins!
---
All you have to do is compare the AH price of mats vs the sale price of the finished product. I've been passively making money on linen bags since day 1. I buy over 1500 cloth a day and make bags and just vendor them. I average between 50s and 1g profit per day, just being AFK making bolts and bags.

“For the horde”
---
I missed her so much. Khaz Modan just hasn’t been the same without her in retail, I was so excited when my Dwarf made his way out of the hills and the Loch loaded in.
---
If I can't get mage food in my first 5ish minutes of being online at this point (47 warrior), I'll play an alt until a guild mage logs on.
---
Bees are dying at an alarming rate.
---
Sorry friend, I wish I could be happy for you, but alas, horde scum...
---
this one is in darkshire but also little creepy as anyone else in that damned town...
---
Thanks! Would you also happen to know of a way to hide it if the pet is happy?
---
Yes. They will cry even more when their server is 99% Horde and there will be no wpvp. Why would you even consider rolling horde on a massively horde dominated realm. It’s so fucking stupid to me. I’ve been playing horde for over 10 years in retail, it’s my faction, but hell no, I’m not going horde when it’s overcrowded and alliance players are struggling to complete simple quests out in the world. Of coarse I’m going Alliance, why would I contribute to make it even worse by rolling Horde.
---
Sicko mode or Yojamba?
---
Or when you see any skulls running toward your direction
---
You got me scared! I’m 29 now so about to hit STV as alliance
---
Did you check your character skills? Like by weapon skills. Thats where it applies
---
Play retail?  Are you joking?
---
Then we can complain about hiding polls for a few years. Good idea.
---
Is there one of these for NA servers?
---
Your druid apparently hacks!
---
Yotus played ya self
---
Dont disable your fire wall just allow the program to go through it in the exceptions setting.
---
I don’t mate, sorry! I’d recommend checking the ElvUi forums.
---
I've been buying fade leaf for 2s ea on the ah, and turning them into blinding powder. 1 fadeleaf makes 3 powder which vendors for 1.25s ea.  Not alot of profit but I buy in bulk and make a couple gold every few hours.
---
Ahh you’re the person asking why you can’t afford a mount at 45
---
reroll imo
---
/r/humblebrag
---
Don’t give people advice if you don’t know what you’re talking about. Leveling combat with a slow sword or mace mainhand is much stronger and more efficient that leveling with daggers.
---
Left out that i was looking to do only princess runs in my advertisements, i didnt ask a full run group to do what i want.
---
this honestly depends. are you a little bitch or a totally cool dude? this is important to know for an answer.
---
yes.All feral druids
---
Thanks, I was looking for this too.
---
HOW ARE YA?
---
No, it just means everyone is a ninja.
---
trust my g, i’m in the same boat. lvl 20 warr and rogue, enjoyed both of those but feel there’s more. now going for the ultimate hybrid of druid, hoping i can sort it out lmao
---
Make a tailor, buy wool cloth, make wool bolts, sell wool bolts.  On my server I can make a profit of 0.5-1.5s per bolt, which adds up pretty quickly.
---
I'm having a great time, though I am a little disappointed at the general difficulty after playing on pservers which were apparently overtuned. I think that overtuning was better for the game now that the playerbase is more skilled. Despite being a change, it made the game more similar to actual vanilla.
---
What level are you? Questing is alrdy rly hard even with layering lol
---
Tauren, maybe
---
Skull level players , groups of 20? 
---
Nah this is exactly how alliance gank, when you’re the less skilled PvP faction
---
There is one SW of the FP and ashenvale. On the other side of the river to the south.
---
ur a whore
---
Blizzard, soon tm

I just did this today. Glad I’m not the only one lol

Few of the talents are personal preference (if you aren't a raid offtank, you don't need imp shield block for example)
---
Well see, ogres are like onions...
---
What's the account called? I'm curious now lol
---
Nice luck man)
---
And gz for mount and BIS
---
You're taking about a single button that uses charge when out of combat but when pressed in combat will switch to BS and Intercept?
---
I'd love to see if anyone can implement this, I haven't had any luck but I'm not macro maker.
---
Post?
---
Not every group is made of 5 yous.
---
Not wasting my time replying to people like you with the IQ of a walnut
---
It's based on information reported to Wowhead, so it's not entirely accurate. I didn't look very hard but I don't remember seeing a standard deviation anywhere.
---
I'm not surprised to see horde outnumbering Alliance by a health amount on Herod.
---
To the op?  I did that in a separate post
---
There’s a few bits worth making, but yes most professions are useless until 275+.
---
It looks like it's in great pain
---
Terrible for dungeons awesome for PvP!
---
That is maybe not true always. As I remember from before if a person won the last roll before, they will lose the next tie.
---
You want to equip your slowest, highest damage blade in main hand, and slowest blade in offhand.
---
You'll find more anti logic sjws on reddit than wow
---
See comments
---
How do you know? Maybe I am? Clean your room.
---
It is kinda sad seeing people doing their raid runs already and getting epics but we just gotta enjoy the journey!
---
It is not.
---
Why do people duel in the worst spots lol. I saw some people dueling in the middle of raven hill and they ended up pulling mor’ladim and dying
---
I did exactly the same thing purely by chance!
---
Ungoro
---
Slower/ higher weapon damage in main hand will make your Sinister Strike hit harder.
---
Thanks but it doesn't seem like battleGROUPS are confirmed. Just cross realm battlegrounds, which we already knew about for a while now.
---
How do you know? Maybe I am. Go clean your room!
---
I once had Tarkin. He had powers to destroy the entire planet Azeroth.
---
I just hit level 30 on my pally, I'd recommend Wetlands and Duskwood, they both have a ton of quests and a fairly straightforward landscape to navigate
---
Never claimed to be an angel.  But it's better to be vengeful against those that have wronged you then to go around fucking over random innocent players.
---
I"m an eye for an eye person not a turn another cheek.  And I'm perfectly fine with that.  If you wanna rollover and let assholes trample you then you do you.
---
Make alts and gear them up with your leatherworking.
---
It's worth pointing out that while this holds true for Molten Core and Onyxia, and to a lesser extent Blackwing Lair, AQ and Naxxramas are far stricter on raid comp and spec.
---
Lol I know if I let myself I would probably fall in too deep so when I realized my sub was gonna end just before school started I took my credit card off. I don't have much self control for that, the game is too fun, it's like weed. Not super harmful but you can get lost in it waaaay too easily and quickly
---
On my server, the only herbs worth AH (vs vendoring (up to level 30)) are swift thistle, briarthorn, steelbloom, and gold thorn (? Idk just picked it yesterday).  I wait til I get a stack of 20 of the other low level stuff and just vendor.
---
And this is why I kos all warlocks and priests.
---
Yikes
---
Nothing like running into people you ran dungeons with at earlier levels. Classic WoW is best WoW.
---
Retailers.
---
Me, too.
---
They should honestly consider themselves lucky that so many of the players who left are willing to come back for Classic and give them their money.
---
They really need to use this opportunity to go in a more positive direction and cut less corners.
---
Sounds like a good time to bring up my server's rival guilds: &lt;Definitely Not A Cult&gt; and &lt;Definitely A Cult&gt;. Good times.
---
Demo for leveling is more fun imo. I think aff is the way to go for min maxing and playing with a dps pet etc.
---
Personally I love to focus my gameplay more around the pets. I like to have my voidy hold aggro better, I like to be tankier, I prefer the ability to quickly re-summon a pet mid combat. 
---
I love how I can mass pull with dots and sac a walker to hellfire without cast pushback. And how I can summon another walker in 0.5sec if I need to.
---
Also you are incredibly tanky as demo, enough to fend off or kill most gankers.
---
I approve, for what it's worth lol
---
6 days? Doubt.
---
Lol what? .... A decent hunter could absolutely do this you're fucking delusional
---
Yes it is. I made that same mistake when I played this game back in the day. Engineering is BIS for all classes and it only takes 1 of your 2 profession slots, so definitely train that at 60.
---
And?  Classic+ is about change and why does 50+ leveling have to be the worst part of the game?
---
ten storms definitely doesn't feel this unbalanced, and most of the horde players seem garbage at pvp anyway
---
It didn't happen all at once. I'd say flying mounts was the first mistake.
---
Wow this is a serious throwback!
---
Don't remember the name but you get it in Undercity. There are two easy (and stupid) parts before this one.
---
Lmao that mechanostrider is so lame
---
What if one time he said it in a really somber tone, with a hint of dread behind it.
---
Yeah that should work pretty well. A tip that ive found works well is to not use heroic strike unless you have excess rage. Save that rage for your other skills. Its probably more relevant when your level 20+. Also dont buy skills and upgrades that you wont use much. Save that gold
---
Isnt that cheating lol?
---
This, pretty much :D
---
You're not making a good argument here.
---
I think Ive been doing it wrong
---
layering has no effect on /who/
---
I thought your name was Harambe for a second.
---
At least your defense and daggers leveled up. You’ll get them next time!
---
Layering, BfA UI, spell batching, 12 yard melee range. Just what I remembered.
---
Yes. Especially because you need to be in battle stance for charge and berserker stance for intercept. I would like to be able to intercept to an ally while in combat with the same button I’m using charge with. They are very similar abilities , one generates rage, one costs rage and can be used on allies too. If anyone has an idea how to do this let us know!
---
Never too late. Starter areas being barren is a good thing because it’s easier to get the stuff you need while in there since everyone won’t be fighting over one mob. And there’s plenty of people you’ll see while leveling as well as end game
---
Yeah its crazy how much more difficult it was on pservers. I always imagined they were undertuned lol. This is like ezmode now
---
Where is this?
---
Is this set up free?
---
And twice the keyword metrics on some server somewhere that paints a nice picture of that weird porn genre you're into!
---
This is a fair suggestion, since I have to stick with combat, thanks!
---
Lol yeh. Well I was just taking the piss with ya. You can cap out but of course go over with lures or gear. Happy fishing!
---
When does it take place?
---
I legit saw 2 lvl 60 mages ganking hillsbrad just yesterday, both too stupid to let me keep curse of tongues on them. This resulted in a chad 49 shaman kicking their asses 1v2 (kinda 2v2 since I spam casted tongues and corruption on them when they didn't resist)
---
Warrior here, sword and board?
---
Nice!! How are you controling the camera so well? That's the most frustrating part of my set up
---
What addon are you using for debuff timers?
---
as a mage that number is only really a good 24 hours of play time tho
---
caus mathematics &gt; feelings
---
TELL ME WHY!
---
Swiftkey is unremovable bloatware on my phone and for that reason alone I can't stomach even the mention of it.
---
Yes I've tried removing it with root, it breaks things.
---
The operating manual for samophlange. Trash it as soon as you start to the quest
---
&gt; They simply artificially removed content and items to gate them into Classic phases
---
&gt; They are not using any earlier patches as reference.
---
I don't know about you but these 2 lines sound contradictory. The first one sounds like what I asked, and the second refutes it.
---
Metzen is not a good writer. I always get in trouble for pointing it out. I'm not attacking the man's character. I like and respect Metzen. Doesn't make him a good writer though.
---
Tauren definitely.
---
If you truly want to know if you can trust your friend in a zombie apocalypse, just watch how they play multiplayer games. Do they gank, ninja loot and never buff? Then they'll backstab you first chance they get.
---
On a serious note, people just put much more value on their own feelings than other peoples feelings. It only works out as a net positive if they genuinely enjoy helping other people out instead of putting them down.
---
...is this a copypasta?
---
It should basically just be if no combat - charge otherwise -berserker stance and intercept
---
business is business
---
It notifies you that your game logged someone nearby entering stealth. Can't show you where they are.
---
Time to go to Costco then. Tell my family I love them and will return in the spring.
---
Cause the hit rating required with dual wield is 3x greater than a 2h weapon.
---
Your rage generation will be higher but you will miss more.
---
Are you actually offended by my totally 100% serious shitpost, enough to psychoanalyze me? Christ.
---
All rolling need is basically saying we all ninja it so that no-one can ninja it.
---
I'm hoping the opposite happens and a lot of Horde leave for Heartseeker.
---
Stay strong ally bros!
---
You're probably losing silver on the AH fee but great job
---
Undead too
---
Not if all you do is log into newly created undead characters! 😂
---
Yessir what would that look like in macro
---
Can we get those as Hordes?
---
Not at all.. Half the people I know my level easily had double that. I don't sell stuff on the AH and they did.
---
I'm not trying to control a market with "COLLUSION". I'm trying to get people the recipes they want from the other faction, something that could already be done, but isn't happening. Why are you against getting a few cooking recipes without being price gouged? But based on your forum history you're just extremely negative and uncooperative in just about every aspect of socialization lol. Good luck
---
Lol so funny to me that calling someone a 'casual' is considered an insult. I should hope everyone is playing a video game casually, if you're maining wow in your life then you're either the .01% of people making money as a professional gamer, or you're a fucking loser deadbeat who thinks video games are life!
---
Everyone knows YouTube doesn't give a shit.
---
My Classic experience was complete the other day when I got invited to a spam chat channel by a gold seller.
---
is there some way to include an if statement that checks a players level and applies the proper fort buff per defined level ranges?
---
I don’t get it
---
Finish Searing gorge, head to ungoro and do everything there.  Ungoro alone Will get you just around 2 levels.  Lets say you get to 53 after these two. 
---
 Then head to fel Wood and start doing the stuff at the lower half, moving up to the upper half following the chains in clusters.  Eventually youll be 54 and bouncing between felwood/winterspring for the 2 ”main” quest lines. 
---
With the killing to be Done lets place you at 55. 
---
Head to WPL and start doing the calduron quests there and the watch towers.  Boom should be close to 56,  move into EPL. do the Tirion quest line and keep doing it untill you unlock the Stratholme painting quest.  
---
Accept all other quests to strat. 
---
Get a quest run for BRD. Make sure you get the MC attunement quest. Do that. Youll be half way to 58 if not 58+. 
---
If you arent quite 58, get ther LBRS quests aswelll and do the lot of them. 
---
Once you are Done there.  Make a group for full stratholme runs. 
---
When inside strat and you need to loot the supply boxes - walk up to them slowly while mouse-overing them.  If the tooltip changes to ”dissarm” Its a trap box.  If not. Open it. 
---
You may need to do two runs to get all the stuff Done,  but youll do more than two since you need the gear aswelll. 
---
If you manage to finish the quests. Hand em in and you may just be 60
---
Pre-Congrats!
---
I’m cool with a Finnish genocide
---
What math? I consistently survive a fight with more health while dw compared to 2h.
---
The prequels and disney star wars are not canon.
---
Retail players.
---
I don‘t think its sad. Everyone enjoys this game in their own way.
---
What conversation?
---
Im ally on Stalagg and its ridiculous how many allies are crying and threatening to transfer
---
What's a good class to get the most out of Engineering? My main is only level 22, but I picked mining/skinning and have a bunch of bars lying around and engineering looks like a really fun profession.
---
I was potentially thinking either priest to make use of all the cloth headgear while supplementing dps with the bombs, or ranger to make use of the guns.
---
The only downrank I feel is decent low levels is on shaman for that ancestral guidance proc (the one that grants bonus armor when you critically heal). Can spam a rank 1 or 2 healing wave until it crits and then just hold out on other stuff with that increased armor %
---
Has to do with the miss chance of dual wielding. Its math. 2h is better untill you get hit-gear.
---
Sadly I'm not familiar enough with the syntax to know.
---
had MANY a death runs during this in the name of science....but,
---
I can do this all day-
---
Slower than dw, less rage generation.
---
How are people like you still such absolute fucking disgusting noobs 15 years after a games release? Like do you just refuse to learn anything?
---
Yes you can see detailed instructions from this thread:

As bad as you are at grammar I guess
---
Only if they are below' level 20, the vast majority of your spells and ranks just have their max coefficient
---
A 2% drift is going to make you reroll? Really? That’s as close as you’re likely to ever see and beyond that you would need hundreds of players pvpibgin a huge melee to make a statistical difference in an given scenario. 
---
This will make no difference in stv or anywhere.
---
You sure pvp server is what you want?
---
I think the A:H ratio across all pvp realms is screwed unfortunately. It's pretty much the same ratio across all realms by the sounds of it.
---
I take a different perspective. I just do it because I want to. Classic is about the journey, not the destination. I completed the missing diplomat for a ring I didn't need. It was easy to do as I traveled around. Then you have dungeon quests. Good excuse to run a dungeon. Good XP. Good times.
---
gitgud
---
There was an alliance player that posted a video of dinging 60 by discovering org. It was pretty sweet
---
Why shouldn't they? YouTube doesn't own WoW and doesn't owe it a filtering service.
---
Hunter and Engineering are a natural fit, definitely.
---
Any class can get a lot out of Engineering, though. And it is really fun!
---
Once you hit 20 it flies, druid is top 3/4 fastest leveling classes.
---
thanks
---
I passed you earlier. /prayed and moved on. Figured you were paying respects to poor Lordaeron.
---
Look at aaaaalll these sheekens!
---
RP realm? That would make it so much funnier, and well played.
---
I'm a warrior main in retail, doing a Mage now. Will probably do a Warrior later, but I don't want my first go-through of Classic to be one of pain and suffering :P
---
Ok, I was having this problem and I figured it out last night!
---
I had been charging my phone via my computer but for some god-awful reason when I would plug my phone into my computer, it would use my phone data instead of my WiFi!! (Did not know this was happening)
---
Well last night, my Wife asked why we just got an alert we have used all our data for the month when we were both at home and on WiFi. I was very puzzled, grabbed my phone that was charging and unplugged it to do some research. As soon as I unplugged it I DC’d. This is what caused me to figure it out. 
---
Now to the disconnecting every 5 mins, my damn cord had a short in it and if it moved, it would stop charging and start charging again, essentially disconnecting me from the internet for a short moment!
---
What about that is a good thing? Gonna answer my own question before you can and say nothing. Nothing whatsoever.
---
But if everyone has the same chance to get it how is anyone a ninja
---
im not even looking forward to fcing because of randomly getting locked out of travel form for up to 5 seconds upon leaving a building

So for leveling a warlock on a pvp server I'd just stick with the green. The damage you gain on DoTs from the +sp isn't even noticeable and Mana pool doesn't matter when you have improved life tap.
---
What warlock robe?
---
Scrolls? And no, not if they are different types.
---
It's stock TukUI. The debuff timers are part of the built-in Unitframes module.
---
Barrens has been unplayable laggy all day on Sulfuras, how are your servers? Annoying.

---
from someone that played shaman a lot in vanilla, this is all wrong.
---
enhance is very fun and viable for pvp.
---
Except you literally cant because you have no way to break a deadzone since feign/traps dont work. Your pet is going to get murdered within 4 seconds and you are incapable of using multishit because then youll pull aggro.
---
You are just bad and probably level 11 your opinion is worthless
---
While it’s not 1 button I find binding stances to shift +1,2,3 and charge/intercept to 1 feels pretty good. With my muscle memory I don’t even think about it now.
---
Are you using an add on to make your graphics better or is my computer just old?
---
Thanks for the quick response I'll have to check it out!
---
Little do you know, a Horde player then proceeded to try to kill this very questgiver and died.
---
The Cringening
---
As someone playing on that server, it doesn't seem alliance sided at all..
---
He was firing warhammers from his composite longbow +3 obviously!
---
Just run dungeons
---
They dont replenish and the weapon is useless once the charges are depleted. Its not a hard farm but obviously tedious. If you are going Druid to play Kitty DPS then you should just go Rogue. If you are playing Druid because you like the versatility and maybe want to try Kitty DPS you can be competitive but it requires that extra bit of effort.
---
Tauren imo
---
Ahh the meme server
---
that was almost 15 years ago. it’s fresh again. go back to retail if you can’t handle it kiddo.
---
Dungeons and raids aren't essential, correct? I can just pve quest to 60 by myself or with another person or two (even if it takes a long time)?
---
Near the Nesingwary quest hub in STV. I was accepting quests and they were fighting nearby, when I saw both of them drop at the same time I went and took the SS.
---
You're not farming enough mobs. Theres a reason you can convert light-&gt;medium-&gt;heavy etc. I'm lvl 27 hunter and my LW is at like 165. The heavy ammo pouch isnt equipable until 30. I've been making myself a lot of gear tbh, although there isnt much to make anyways. Try to do more quests with mobs that can be skinned.
---
Nope, it requires 2 button presses, but all actions in macros are gated to one button press one spell. It works because after you cast feign death you are no longer in combat and that line has the \[combat\] condition. You can also only cast a trap out of combat, so they will never conflict.
---
Man when the camera goes in and out like that super fast it makes me feel sick.
---
I think you mis-read my post. I’m not saying I want to re-roll for 2%. I’m asking if there really is just a 2% difference. Is that accurate? Or is it really a higher % difference?
---
No waaaaay man, that's so cool!
---
You're literally fucking making this up to get karma you piece of human garbage. I played vanilla and people always rolled need on the more expensive BoE items. Only actual fucking noobs don't know this.
---
Dude...finally someone is bringing attention to this.
---
I noticed this didn't work and was actually heartbroken. When I first heard about the release of Classic, this is one of the first memories that popped into my head when I wondered if I should come back.
---
This is extremely disappointing, and anyone who says otherwise should think again. YOUR Class could be next.
---
No proc, no proc, no proc, have to heal, mob is at 20%, proc and triple crit...
---
Yup. I love skarm. He knows what hes talking bout.
---
Except those are different games...And btw League is mentioned on Dota subreddit and vice versa occasionally. 
---
This thread was about a grind in Vanilla and a very similar grind in BC and sharing that experience.  It's retarded to think that's not allowed because one happened in BC.  And BC is mentioned all the fucking time in the posts about "what might happen after classic".  BC is extremely relevant in both the negative things that started to happen in BC, the similarity to classic because it was right after, the good things in BC like class balancing, etc etc.
---
BC is talked about all the time and it should be.  It's the successor to vanilla as opposed to those other games you mentioned not being directly tied to each other.
---
So yeah that's a stupid way to look at a subreddit.
---
you shouldn't level instantly like in retail
---
Minus 50 DKP!
---
Yes. You can see the setup details from the other thread. But the controls can be much improved from that video. 
---

I like how many people use this kind of layout for their frames, almost feels like blizz should take the hint and put them there normally. Or at least make the UI movable by default. I guess it can be a little overwhelming for newbs to have so many elements to screw with but you could hide it away in advanced settings
---
I just dinged 18 last night. Guess the next 42 levels are gonna come thick and fast from here then.
---
Ah yes. The ghetto of WOW.
---
Watch Skarm’s video’s, one of the best tanks in classic WoW. He probably had a video on it.
---
on Benediction (Alliance) I’ve gotten invited to a channel for that at least once every 2 hours since I started. on Sulfuras (Horde) it never happened
---
"Not my problem."
---
This is some acid trip low effort post
---
Rise above homeboy. There are a-holes everywhere but they are vastly outnumbered ime here.
---
they just picked mages for easy fast aoe leveling while abusing layers
---
Got this add myself yesterday
---
Simply put, yes, and secondly it is not griefing as defined in Vanilla ToS.

Lol, it's a BOE- You can't get mad for someone rolling on a BOE. Everyone should roll on a BOE purple at that. It's not a ninja. 
---
Glad he won it. Best of luck next time.
---
I'd say that's when the fun really starts
---
I do this every time I log out. Not only for `I M M E R S I O N`, but also because the habit makes it way easier to remember to log out at an inn for that rested xp.
---
Its the same as doing quests in Westfall then at lvl 22-23 you decide to go BFD do it once. Nonsense.
---
Once you get sweeping strikes it will get fun and every time you get a new weapon you will feel powerfull even at 60 you can feel your character gain strenght with every item upgrade you get, makes them very fun to play.
---
Can’t blame autocorrect...or caaannnn you?
---
You’re really stretching here, man.  It’s okay to be wrong, just learn and not do it again and stop justifying your mistakes.
---
Dungeon grinding will always be an option, and level 50+ dungeons have lots of 'preraid bis' type of gear as well. 
---
A lot of the PVP will likely be in the highest level zones, Silithus, EPL, etc.  I think by far the tougher task (compared to leveling 50-60) will be farming end-game mats!
---
But when would he have time to work on his dhadgar jokes?
---
Why the down votes? Was just pointing out that min maxing isn't the same in classic as it is these days.
---
Was just thinking the same thing!
---
Yes and No. It's vastly easier than when I played the first time which is kinda devaluing in my personal experience. But at the same time it's very chill, nostalgic and still fun to play, more than most things.
---
You can't get more circlejerk than that.
---
Horde on pagle. Feelsbadman
---
Don't take a hunter with you and you're good.
---
haha that was awesome
---
Oh fuck no old school plaguelands were the best. It felt like it was a 3 way war between the argent dawn, the scourge, and the scarlet crusade
---
I was sub and it was amazing for world PvP. I was always ready for combat. switched tho because blade flurry is so good for grinding and killing mobs on my own was rough. I'm enjoying combat tho and still do lots of damage in PvP but ya slow stealth is rough
---
For anyone wondering how these effects were achieved, you'll need a GeForce GPU, and the latest GeForce Experience driver.
---
First, change your wow.exe in your C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_ to anselintegrationtestapp.exe
---
Then, once in game press Alt + F3, and some settings should come up (iof not press Alt+Home and go to your nVidia settings and enable Game Filter). Add some Brightness contrast/color/sharpening, play until it looks great to you (can take some time) and you've just upgraded your game to the next level!
---
Everywhere looks *so good*. Its insane. 
---
Sorry if you're AMD. I heard of some options for you guys but I dont know about them, as I have nVidia.
---
Thanks to /u/Wooboosted for the initial guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d36st9/to_the_dwarf_priest_who_posted_a_couple_days_ago/ezztdyu/?context=3), I just thought more people should know about this.

 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oi0V0oZZVAGusft0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oi0V0oZZVAGusft0o)  Is what i got from your base. What else would you have put points in for frost? I didnt think i needed wand spec
---
What is the current average?
---
I’ve never done this yet, but certainly contemplating it you have to look at the bigger picture buddy
---
I have yet to be in a group that pulled SM correctly. Every mob flees. Why aren't you pulling back at all?
---
You *might* run low on quests as you're getting towards the end from, say, 52 onward but I think you should be fine. You can definitely get by without doing any dungeons :)
---
What is this sorcery and how do you set it up?
---
horde confirmed the pvp faction and alliance the rp faction
---
Whenever that happens I just /tickle the person riding near me. Nobody ever does it back. :(
---
ABUSED LAYERING TO GET 60? LOOOOOL you don't even know this player and you think you can make an assumption like that.. There are plenty of 60s in the game my misinformed friend. Go back to BFA and quit crying cause you're not 60
---
I did it together with another hunter. We kited the dragons about forever. But we killed both the red mobs, as two.
---
Yes. Every bit of it (except layers)
---
Yeah doubt you're the 1st. I've been there on like 5 separate occasions on my server showing others how to get there.
---
isnt classic like 1.12 im confused how 1.8 was before
---
Add up your own math there
---
No I actually mained horde until recently. Now I play on a 1:4 alliance:Horde pvp server. I just thought your logic had a fallacy in it.
---
Yeah, the biggest significance of the imbalance is really just shorter queues for Alliance when BGs come.
---
Ha, jokes on you guys! Hes not wearing any gear!
---
my guess is your mana regen pulled
---
Ok dummy - let me explain - it raises your defense skill by 4...but you have to have maxed out defense before it applies. If you’re not melee - it’s unlikely you’re maxed. 
---
Let’s say for your level you can have 20 defense, but you’re 13/20 defense skill. It now means you can have a 24 defense capped - but you still are only going to have 13.
---
You can’t take advantage of it until you’re capped.
---
Your Feral Harness of the Monkey auction expired.
---
That's exatctly what we're hoping for!
---
its on a single server
---
U sure your imp isnt attacking?
---
I have had the opposite experience. But maybe that's because I'm a Horde who largely plays in solo mode. 
---
He who solos gets ganked. Regardless of faction.
---
From what I've seen throughout the years, the vast majority of people prefer "cute and pretty" characters. Just look through a random city in FFXIV and you'll see hordes of catgirls/catboys and very few of the bulkier, more monstrous races.
---
Same with Guild Wars 2, same with WoW once Blood Elves became a thing, same with Monster Hunter: World which isn't even an MMO, and the list goes on. People just seem to gravitate towards the pretty, human-like characters regardless of genre.
---
you mean DM run.
---
It does at the beging at [0:42](https://i.imgur.com/Ywuj6jN.png) I added the timestamp at 0:40 so people don't miss it...
---
There aren't really big storyline events in vanilla. The closest you'll get is the Onyxia attunement quest in Stormwind, which is Alliance-only, and the AQ/Naxx opening events, which are available for both factions. Thrall just kinda sits in his throne room for the whole time.
---
Bro, any BOE epic world drop is fair game
---
72 hrs of work in the past 6 days...but I'm already 60 with an epic mount so I'm not missing much :p
---
Experiement and find mobs you can kill that satisfy the following criteria. 
---
-provide cloth/coin/vendor items
---
-easy to kill for you
---
-has good mob density / not contested 
---
There’s really it. Experiment.. you may have to get a couple spots you go to because if there’s an area with those three criteria met you better believe it’s on somebody else’s list.
---
what if he just swings back?
---
In terms of looks? Hmm I quite like the orc female looks with full t2.
---
Now, it took how long??? 4 days or something like that???
---
This is not vanilla. This is a remake of vanilla set up in 2019. And things evolve.
---
I know that I guess it’s really low pop server, stalagg has probably a thousand level 60s
---
In vanilla I was a NE hunter. I chose NE because I played Warcraft 3 and always thought they were cool. Chose hunter class because I was young and wanted a pet lol. 
---
When BC game out I switched to BE paladin, because BE looked awesome and I wanted to try out pally and I ended up loving it. 
---
I stopped playing at some point during WOTLK and when I came back for Classic I went with my original race, NE but chose Druid class because I always liked them but never leveled one passed like 12   
---
Level 34 now and loving my NE Druid
---
Kk thanks. I have skining so should i vendor or AH all the leather i get?
---
Had a Gut Ripper drop the other day, before any tolls go out the warrior called for everyone to need so that no one can ninja. Moral is just have everyone need on epic BOE drops, that'll stop a lot of hurt feelings.
---
Can't tell if this is a language issue or if you guys are just being obtuse. NOBODY IS SAYING YOU SWALLOW THE FUCKING POUCH.
---
"Why wouldn't I Need on a Shield as a priest? Training my Enchanting is more useful than that warrior using it for a few levels" 
---
This is you, don't do that.
---
and he can't equip it, he doesnt actually need it, where is this made up BOE rule?
---
Immolation potion.

Dire maul is fun but it’s not comparable to the first VC run
---
Saw you posting in trade chat, this must be fixed
---
Why the fuck didn’t you all agree to roll need? Honestly I don’t feel sympathy for these “ninja” loots. Everyone should just roll need.
---
If I still had a copy of adobe illustrator I'd probably try it. Not sure what I'd write about though
---
gun trainer is in thunder bluff just heads up
---
Definitely a reddit thing. This site is full of made up rules and standards.
---
I play as an ironman, so personally it gets boring fast that the best way to do 90% of stuff is just spam slayer for supplies, gold, exp. It also makes most bossing trivial since you can just wait for a task to make it 15% easier. Its just a completely overloaded skill, way too much is gained from doing slayer vs any other activity in game which in my humble opinon isnt good game design.
---
During my first time tanking as an arms warrior in rfc, I was having trouble keeping aggro. The enhancement shaman kept getting aggro. How can I improve my tanking?
---
How did you find out who their guild leader was?

This is why everyone rolls need in boe epics

---
Trolls have BiS mount for the Horde so if you want to be big pimpin' go troll.
---
Yeah this happens and it sucks. This is straight up ninjaing. To avoid this, suggest everyone Need on the purple BoEs. Have the conversation in chat before selecting Greed/Need.
---
Best part is it lets you track people who have killed you and builds a handy Kill On Sight list, then alerts you when someone on that list is nearby.
---
Gank me when I'm so low level you can one shot me? I'll remember that and get you right back when we meet on more equal footing.
---
Thank you friend!
---
I don’t care what color it is. Need &gt; greed.
---
A lot of groups back in the day would agree to all need roll on world drops, to prevent this.
---
Biggus Dingus!
---
Mark targets for focus dps if you arent already. It makes tanking so much easier for a warrior when you arent having to aoe as your main source od threat (you will still have to aoe to keep aggro off the healer)
---
Yeah, I also figured out how stupidly easy it is to farm karma on here by saying literally anything bad about retail.
---
Some of Azeroths greatest heroes put factions aside for various reasons. Tirion Fordring saving Eitigg life at the cost of his status among his people. Thrall and Cairne also come to mind.
---
Feels great to see so many people in an online again. Man I miss the heydays of MMOs from the mid naughties.
---
Vendor. A lot of people are lvling skinning so the market is really bad at the moment. Not really worth it to sell on AH.
---
Pretty much all the zones you listed are the place to be for your level. You can get to Desolace by taking the boat from Menethil to Auberdine. The boat that docks on the *right* pier will take you there. From there you can just run south through Darkshore, Ashenvale and Stonetalon Mountains until you make it to Desolace. Make sure to grab the flight paths along the way too! Getting there will take a while but it's worth it.
---
Spread the word! Horde are definitely becoming aware of it and hopefully beginning to move. No one wants it to snowball to terrible 75/25 or worse
---
True, but those are months/years off.
---
And even then, if you show up to raids you are likely to have a secure raid spot, so long as you arent in a cutting edge guild
---
Should have a cancel macro just like Ice Block etc.
---
Happens to me all the time
---
You create your own story in Classic :)
---
If it is epic BoE not from a raid, you all need. Quite simple.

And here I just started levelling a hunter after giving up on my warrior at 30.
---
Furthers my argument that all alliance players are sociopaths lmao
---
Nobody needs an epic world drop, everybody does need 100+ gold right? Need anything purple that is BOE
---
If you are just looking for 1v1 duals, then Ret Pally might be the better option cuz they never die. In BGs/ World PvP when you can get a healer, Warriors are unstoppable and Ret Pallys become somewhat meh.
---
Ret gear and Holy gear are totally different. You'll want Str as a Ret Pally, and Holy Pallys gear for typical healing stats, and sometimes even wear Cloth armor.
---
Sell it, mount.
---
Completely different thing. Spelling out racist stuff with dead bodies is not the same as preventing a high level mob from killing lowbies. They haven't made lvl 15 quest givers immune to the other faction, they haven't put DKs in phase 1, they haven't created a no corpse camping policy. It's obviously a bug.  
---
They've specifically said they're interested in recreating the corrupted blood 'incident' lol.
---

Oof, I am Alliance on Mankirk. I didn't really think anything of the server name. I just picked a server where I could play both factions as I wasn't sure if I was going Alli Rogue or Horde Shaman. As a lvl 34 rogue and this kinda just makes me want to reroll on another server but getting to 30+ has already taken me forever. If I reroll I doubt I ever get to 60.
---
Stop joining dungeon cleave groups and you won't have problems with dungeon cleave groups lmao
---
source?
---
Stupid AF. Rolling ’need’ is for when, you know - you NEED the item, to use it. To make gold by selling it? Yeah, that’s greed. If you dont need it and cant sell it, you pass on the item. It’s almost as if the roll-options actually had a thought behind them...
---
I’m the friend that quit. You’re kidding yourself if you don’t realize much of a waste of time that game is. And that’s putting into consideration it’s good points.
---
Sure?
---
100% be orc, stun resist is too strong
---
That money you’re claiming will circulate in the economy will in-fact go to an NPC for spells this early to launch.  Moreover, your argument is a fallacy and I hope it’s out ignorance otherwise you have no consideration for others.  Do a hypothetical retrospective, a party member can either walk away with a new tool to level their character or another character can make a quick 19silver at the expensive of a party member’s benefit.
---
Your big picture benefits your picture, not others.

Mana is still important

What podcast we talking about bud
---
Hey was that on ashbringer? My corpse is still there!
---
Cool. Good talk.
---
That's a fucking ninja and you goddamned know it.
---
If everyone rolls need to sell it's one thing.
---
When the group is greed rolling, or someone is clearly need rolling to equip it, you fucking hit greed as well unless you can also equip it. Otherwise you're a piece of shit that deserves to be blacklisted from every group you ever try to join.
---
Arena has no item drops. All you can earn is honor &amp; arena rating

It's funny how Chromie was always a weird character, but eventually in the years we realise they're a bronze dragon.

I would too if I saw a 60 messing with a level 49.  If you get your ass handed to you by the 49 you deserve to be laughed at for starting shit.
---
I think he means the Arena event in BRD. 
---
The arena gives you one out of 5(I think..) bosses, and there are a couple of amazing pieces to get most noticeably the gladiator chest which is amazing for dps warriors and hunters. There's also a caster belt that's prebis from there.
---
Getting these pieces take a ungodly amount of attempts, the chance to get the chest is like 2-3% from entering the arena.
---
Undead= better in pvp

Troll= better in pve

&gt; You can say avoid cleave groups, but now I can barely find any groups that want to do regular runs.

You can say avoid cleave groups, but now I can barely find any groups that want to do regular runs. ZF GY farm only, BRD Fire Runs, SM Cleave (before and after the bug fix)

Casinojack is fine, as it could be considered an in-game nickname.
---
I personally was put off the whole auto attack, but have been leveling one up and it isn’t that bad for me. It’s frustrating when you see other classes just doing all the things but i have learned to love it in a weird way. Sometimes less is more ?
---
Not as important as having a really cool sounding spell like DEVOURING PLAGUE!
---
I've been vendoring everything up to heavy leather. Thick leather seems to start selling much better on AH.
---
It's stock TukUI. Everything you see is built into it somewhere.

I tried it and it would stop casting if the target wasn’t pick pocketable

Youre basically complaining tht people play different or more efficient after 15yrs of wow

I just got home, NO IDEA...
---
I was running SM Lib yesterday and as we were running out of the dungeon because our AoE group pulled too many there were only three of us left and I decided to kill the monk that was almost dead and dinged (I was the healer) and one mage and the tank were still barely alive so I dropped a earthbound totem and slowed the mobs and then proceeded to kill the guys we were just running from it was the definition of clutch
---
Most classes miss a lot with DW until later levels and some plus hit gear. Missing can be a big pain in the ass. I prefer the consistency of a 2h when I can get one.
---
That’s what they all they lmfao
---
You're living in the world and you see the aftermath of wc3, but you're not gonna be personally questing with Thrall. You're just some adventurer.
---
Actually it is
---
Did you just have a stroke?
---
I think a big part was how new expansions were added to the game. They were essentially pasted on top, invalidating all the old content and thus making it feel increasingly like a chore to get through to get to the "real game" rather than a cohesive world to immerse yourself in from start to finish.
---
The super brain is to do Arena angerforge and golemlord runs in 12 mins since you can't do more than 5 runs an hour anyway. This way you can invite a healer for the golemlord trinket, casters for belt and boots, and rogues for HoJ.
---
If you are planning on making a 39 twink that will use these you should save. If you are not sure about even what class you want to be a lvl 39 twink or not even sure if that is something you will do, sell now and get them gold pieces
---
It was absolutely terrible on some private servers, like no use in even trying just go afk and rez in a couple minutes because you're not getting a single cast to stick.
---
I mean, for me personally, I'm sad that I'm not level 60 with them because I've been held back by real life shit :) wish I was getting my epics but I'm only level 34
---
Some people reeeeeeeally need to chill the fuck out
---
Did he ask for a reroll?
---
"Lol I need gold" is a piss poor lie that shit people tell themselves to make them feel better. He ninja'd it and that's not going to change because you're trying to rationalise it.
---
They could put a bounty of switching from a PvE server. 2 or 3 times your level in gold to move a character over.  I was leveling as alliance on Thunderfury and the level 40+ zones were bad enough I just swapped to a PvE server.

I found this addon - description says on target so, fingers crossed.
---
It's so good. The world feels alive. Every single zone has people.
---
Wow that's a comprehensive UI! TY
---
I’m more than happy to sink the 31 points in if needed, I’ve raided a long time ago but never as a tank. i wanted to see if there was an in-between build which is popular, doesn’t get shield slam, but is still decent for tanking, but has some use in PvP outside of WSG and AV.
---
I buffed one of the NPCs on the “Missing Diplomat” quest with a stamina scroll. Then had to fight him. /facepalm
---
Horde on Pagle... I guess BGs will be quick queues.
---
That might be a problem with players more than the game.
---
Vanilla wasn't perfect. It has these issue and players need to learn to overcome them. There are optimal ways to do it and sub optimal ways to do it but it can be done with some care.
---
To make the changes you suggest would be to change the experience of that original WoW experience, warts and all.
---
I think you are likely coming up against players who aren't used to that and approach it with retail mentality of having the perfect stats and spec and gear.
---
So did you take it out?
---
LF DPS SAVAGE GLADIATOR ON RESERVE BTW!
---
I've done countless dungeon groups and I haven't had a single cleave group.
---
I'll give it a shot and let you know.
---
Stop spreading bullshit.
---
Welp, I dunno what they accept as I always pay with PayPal. Maybe ask a friend if he could buy it for you in exchange for the PSC?
---
You can't outlast his snares because you're not hitting him back. Are you planning on him getting tired and giving up? You didn't even hamstring him before you conc blowed and tried to run away.
---
Classic blunder, gatta watch out for those Nightelven deadfall traps! Its a dangerous world (of warcraft) out there!
---
It's because the kids don't get their instant gratification and leave before they hit group levels. Plus the servers *actually being servers* fosters a community which means people have some fear of being held accountable, at least for some things.
---
^ Why are there any other comments?
---
Dude, I'm Kromcrush alliance and even our side, Ironforge and Stormwind are packed. It's amazing.
---
Hey hey heeeeeey!
---
More accurately he is complaining that the game rewards sitting in a fucking dungeon all day reclearing it on repeat instead of actually playing the game properly.
---
It's not the players fault, it's the game design that fucking blows, and I hate whoever discovered this technique because the game was great without it. I won't shame anyone for a different playstyle or for playing efficiently. That's natural. It's the responsibility of the game design to promote good playstyles by rewarding it.

---
I'm a lvl 33 warrior, would it be worthwhile to pay about 10g for the elemental charms for the WW axe, or should I just grind it out and eventually go for the SM axe? I have no help for the quest items.
---
I just wish the "leaders" got their shit together and realized we all live on the same goddamn planet.
---
Not sure why’d you want to ruin somebody else’s experience when there’s so many other things to do.
---
I agree. The retail mentality has definitely seeped into the game. Had players asking guildies what their BiS ratios were just to run UBRS.
---
Once you get to thick leather and up you can start auctioning it for good profit. I'm at least gonna stick with skinning until I get the mats for my devilsaur pieces then I'll think about dropping it for engineering. Probably gonna keep it until I can squirrel away all of the mats I need to power level engi tho
---
Square is trap, moon is sheep.
---
I created an alt and i can always create stuff thats 1-2 lvls above me. I set myself this challenge and i honestly dont have space for quests except the ones with animals. The grind for mats seems to be quite the amount of grind you also need for lvling. Been 10 lvls now only killing animals with almost no quests. (first 5 levels literally no quests at all just grinding boars)

Macros can help with pvp as prot. Look in too some old arena teams there was a few great prot warrior's back in the day that had builds for what ever you needed
---
Oh shit my first ever Reddit shoutout thanks friend :)

Pickpocket potions have saved me so much time from avoiding death walks. I've even had enough to pop the smaller ones on cd to avoid down time. Pickpocket is great as long as it doesn't get resisted

My census has about 33000 for horde but this includes 3000 level 1s
---
Guild chat, especially in rp guilds, is not for conteoversial or political discussions. Keep that shit to barrens chat. Some cesspool guilds are just second barrens chat but dont expect an rp guild to allow that stuff. 
---
A gkick out of nowhere might be a touch extreme but if it was my guild (whether i was the gm or officer) id have immediately taken you aside to tell you to cut it the hell out. Definitely not the sort of conversation to make people feel welcome/comfortable regardless of gender or political views.
---
KEEP YE-

All those addons and you still got played
---
Oh sweet!
---
He streamed it all brother.
---
Prime example as to what's wrong with Classic's community right here.
---
You can't charge in combat though.
---
Rag is being downed like crazy so competitive PVE isn’t a real thing in classic and competitive PvP took time back in vanilla, not sure how it translates to current classic but PVP is being released slowly through the phases
---
Groups of classes that can't cleave do runs.
---
Or guild group runs.
---
ED gang! 
---
*throws gang signs*
---
Polymorphing other mobs apparently was in vanilla. I haven't seen any proof from either side which is rather frustrating.  
---
Walljump removal was a bit of a necessary change. Recreating it as it was just wasn't really feasible and it wasn't an intended thing. 
---
There are quite a few changes out there. Some of them are essentially just bugs not fixed yet, others are intentional legion features like API, various settings, graphics, and lots of small QoL stuff
---
Yeah it's an helmet

What do you call a group of neckbeards? A bottleneck

---
 Unfortunately as a rogue, a lot of people start on you.
---
This is awesome, thanks!
---
Don't learn all your skills (no, they aren't all useful). Definitely dont learn all your profession skills. Most are useless. Just get the ones u need to skill.
---
I m sad about this. I am one of the people with one of these mounts on EU realm. I liked that race back in the day.
---
I trust randos more than friends lol
---
I want an MMO with somewhat classic mechanics (mainly RP immersion) with updated graphics. Nothing crazy, just throw me a few more poly's
---
I getcha, I think the word you might be looking for is 'Curated'.  Because cata leveling is definitely that.  And you're right, a curated questing experience does make you feel less like you're trapped on a hostile planet where even your allies are assholes, and more like you're in an adventure movie.  But the 'you just live here' feeling of classic does basically prevent holding onto story threads while leveling.  in Cata EPL there's a great chain where you accompany a caravan of paladins and travel across the zone with them.  Burning Steppes has you rigging up an elaborate trap to get revenge with John ~~Rambo~~ Keeshan that spans the entire zone.  
---
There's a few plotlines that actually have more than one event in them in classic, but they're often so spread out that if your goal is leveling up you're much better off just skipping them for the static 'I'll stand here, you go kill things' quests you mentioned.  I just did the Shimmering Flats / Booty Bay chain that involves sabotaging one set of racers so Kravel can bet on the other guys and make money, and you pretty much have to stop and go to another zone to level up in the middle of it, which completely loses the plot (not to mention taking a boat back and forth at least 4 times). And then you don't even get to see the race or make any money off the scam, it just kinda ends.  Between this type of thing and being constantly derailed by running into brick walls of unsolo-able quests and the like, you're MUCH better off following a questing guide for all your outside-dungeon leveling, which basically wipes out the immersion entirely, for me anyway.  
---
I mean just look at the threads in this subreddit, people are excited about how satisfying it is to get their mount or finally get a decent weapon upgrade rather than any kind of story event or characterization.  I have a hard time getting excited about being able to continue playing the game after being slowly stymied by having to scrap together money or using gear so bad I can't kill even level mobs.  That's removing an annoyance, not giving me a gift.
---
So yeah I'm glad folks are enjoying it, I just wish I was playing the same game they were, like I mentioned above.
---
I've the FINEST wires in the land.

---
I don't like a single zone they changed. I like most zones they added in every xpac, but changing every old zone was kind of insulting to me, it was the entirely wrong way to "improve" leveling. 
---
All those old zones you like? We think they're bad now. You can't be in them anymore.

I'm a first time player and im playing a Horde Druid. I've had teleport to moonglade for a while and done both of my quests linked there, but every time the only way I could figure out to get out is to hearth. Is there a way to exit moonglade without hearthing? 
---
Also if I recast the spell I'm just teleported to the moonglade spawn point.
---
Don’t tell me what to do

Anyone saying a bear can't tank raids is just scared of trying something not meta. It's been done plenty of times over. You're not the absolute best but who really cares when we've already done this before.

I wanted to pick the smaller population this time around, but last minute I decided I wanted to play Shaman. This is gonna be rough, I hate queue times.
---
This is my first time playing WoW, do these population demographics snowball and get worse, or stay consistent?
---
Training + Mount is 90g combined.
---
Oh yeah, Swiftkey isn't doing that. Definitely not
---
90g for the training plus the horse.
---
Literally could have taken less time to find the answer themselves than it took for them to insinuate I was talking out of my ass.  Which I wasn't.  But thanks for the downvotes, nontheless.
---
it just struck me that I literally have no clue where the inn in UC is! i never even thought about it! woah!
---
You don't - but you can help kill the infernal if you want to be the good guy. Internals are actually very weak, people just assume they are strong because they look like they should be. The spell also has a 10 min cd, and costs the Lock 50 silver.
---
Not that it matters, pretty sure blizzard nerfed them to only attack the summoner when dismissed. I think that is the wrong move, but w/e, internals tend to become pointless late game anyway.
---

There should be a tunnel out iirc (in the south). I thought there was also a flight path.
---
I ambush, sinister strike, and 2 combo evis and they are dead. Also speced into improved eviscerate. Been playing a rogue for 10 years. Cookie cutter builds aren't the only way to get things done.
---
What the fuck. I sincerely don’t understand why this happened. It’s seriously frustrating. I want to talk about this!
---
I agree. I dont have the time anymore. I just bought a house that need to be renovated. Its gonna take me a year to finish. So i think about getting a boost, then i can play with My 60 friends if i get some free time in between.
---
Use the auction house. Any cloth you don’t need to progress your first aid should be sold on the auction house. Occasionally the greens or blues you receive have stat combinations that are sought by one or more classes. Search the AH for similar items to get an idea of pricing. If they don’t sell the first/second time. You might as well vendor the item.
---
Pro Tip: hold onto any BoE blue pieces as they may be worth A LOT of gold when PvP twinks become a thing when battlegrounds are released.
---
Nothing is perfect; WOTLK is just the greatest.

---
Just got 60% at 44 1/2 last night (as a mage), don’t feel bad. AOE spots in the world are pretty hit. Herod horde ratio is like 70:30 it seems as well.
---
Yeah I never understood the need for people to have the biggest dick on WoW. The contents not going anywhere and I'm sure itll be at least year before they talk about moving us into BC
---
This happened in vanilla aswell
---
Literally to prevent this. Think before you type.
---
Okay, thanks a lot
---
invite me to layer, cause mine is fuckin empty
---
There is a quest chain in Arathi that leads to a nice 1h sword with str and sta 2.3 speed.  It is one of the elite quests in Stormgarde.  I sold it on my mage this morning.  You won't be able to access that area for a few more levels though.
---
TFW you dont want to spend 10s to fly to Ogrimar from Stonehedge Mountains so you fly to Thunderbluff instead. 
---
Helps that ThunderBluff is hella smaller makes running around less fucking annoying.
---
We all need 700g just as much as he needs an item, it is BoE not BoP for a reason. Why wouldn't every single item just be BoP if some items weren't made to be traded/sold? 
---
Please try to be less braindead I am begging you.
---
You can train 2 Primary Professions, and everyone can train the 3 Secondary Professions, which are Fishing, Cooking, and First Aid.
---
Theyd be more jelly of the 20k gold than the parrot surely.
---
Yes. The class quests are one of the main things brought up about missing from current wow. You shouldn’t have a problem finding people to help. 
---
I was able to get my warrior whirlwind axe right at level 30 because of some awesome people helping me. 
---
I know the streamers and a lot of others may make you feel pressure to get to 60 but don’t rush. They will clear everything and be bored and move on to another game within a month or two. Enjoy the game and take your time. Plus most of them have been playing private servers for the last 3-5 years and have seen the content recently.
---
Yeah but all the top guilds and players on most servers have already abused it. Server economies are already pretty screwed lol. Just one example - but Black lotus is selling for about 20-30g on most servers. In Vanilla, they were worth over 100g. I can't imagine how bad it will get if layering continues for a few months ro longer - specially with more and more players at 60.
---
This isn't close to the biggest issue.

I loved new thousand needles. All that strangelkep $$.  Well at least before they fucked up proffesions to the point of no point.

Frost definitely didn't take the game a little slower. My man did an accidental 27 hour stream and hit 60 in the first week.

Blah blah blah I get it you're an asshole

Is it worth re rolling if I'm on an unbalanced server?
---
Lvl 21 horde on Mirage Raceway
---
Unless someone can use it right?
---
Do you have a tutorial on how to do this?
---
I remember in WotLK in the character window there were dropdowns that let you choose to see different specific defensive and offensive stats. As a mage I could see my spell power, chance to crit with a spell, etc.
---
Is there a way to get these back for classic?
---
There's 2 different flightpaths. One only takes you to Thunderbluff, and another acts like a normal FP but it requires quite a few other fps to work most of them are highlvl.
---
I'm guessing orc then?
---
WotF makes it pretty one sided. Although in wpvp, anything can happen.
---
enslave demon works fine he might not have a high enough rank. each rank says how high a level it can enslave. i havent had any problems with this.

depends on the context-

received one or two i believe from either travel form druids or spirit wolf shamans, those are E/S

Wasn't max lvl water a drop, not a trained skill?
---
If they sell for 20k gold then I'll be annoying the people willing to pay 20k gold for it
---
Yeh except your epic mount stays static.
---
Actually, you Revenge him right before you Conc Blow, so you could've used the rage to Hamstring -&gt; Conc blow. Why wouldn't you expect him to get out of combat after 5 seconds of him not attacking you and you not attacking him?
---
And yeah, you did kill him after you dedicated 80% of the fight to trying to run away -- trying to run away while you're snared and he's not.
---
Sorry unrelated, but what's the add on that changes your party healthbars to that?
---
I read your name wrong as StrikeyWifey at first
---
I give bitches 10 if you want more then pay me
---
I see no reason it would, its apply a filter on top of your game through nVidia. Its like changing your monitor settings as far as i can tell.
---
Team player. I like it
---
I'm super buzzed on promethazine and oxy (post-op), and so I'm having a hard time processing all of that, BUT
---
I disagree with most. Costly flying, eh, worth it. Better than it is now. Dailies were great for farming. The finder tool is great, and I would like it in Classic IF it was a locked playerbase from THAT server. Free loot bosses were somewhat silly, but I know it got several good friends of mine into the game very quickly, and they still play today.
---
We raided a lot, so obvs agreed on that part. Aesthetics, no contest from BC to WOTLK. I mean it's laughable.
---
Layers aren't going away, a lot of servers have 60k+ pop.
---
Literally wanted to upvote this twice.

Can I change which primary I want to do whenever I want? Or once I start is it locked in

---
Yea. I actually got the ivory back in vanilla and exchanged it for one of the others because armor is cool! Still sad about that
---
Hahahahaga love the comment
---
Its a great choice.
---
IMO the population curve went south because WOTLK was the third act of WoW, it was the summit of all that had been happening. Everything since then has been BS.
---
I'll cosign
---
OK, so it sounds like faction isn't an issue. What about class? Are there class storylines? Like the most fun I'vehad in WoW is the class order halls. Anything like that? I'd love to learn more about mages, for example. But if there's nothing really class specific then I'd probably just roll priest.
---
ah.. you mean cheating.  Nice one...
---
He just wants a big tiddy self gf.
---
I don't think it's that long away. They have stated that they want layering removed before phase 2 is released and Ion Hazzikostas  has stated that they want phase 2 out within a couple of months to get world bosses, Dire Maul, and the PvP system out.
---
LFD has its ups and downs. And yeah different games for sure, agreed.

---
You can drop any profession at anytime and pick up a new one, but you will lose all progress you've made if you ever decide to pick it up again.
---
For example, you can have Mining up to 75 and drop it for Enchanting. You will start Enchanting at 0 skill. If you then drop Enchanting and pick up Mining again, you will start back at 0 skill.
---
gtfo youre actually trash
---
Exactly!  I think in vanilla I got my mount around 42. But I enjoyed my time questing and seeing different areas. To me grinding would be too boring and I’d end up being burned out with the game by then. Plus quest rewards get better and trash loot from mobs get bet in higher zones.
---
What was that addon called to see an items item lvl and does it still work for classic?
---
people normally don''t have any idea about what they're talking about and just repeat what they read on the internet. 
---
as you said, dps scaling is a thing in raid, since we're talking about consistent DPS. Burst DPS for hunters still high even in late game. Anyway, PVP is not about DPS. Warriors are one of the best DPS in the game and still, they suck in WPvP. SP have mediocre DPS compared to warriors and mage and still are top tier in WPvP. PvP is about CCing and not going into OOM.
---
You too, go join him
---
You should have given you the INT buff first.
---
They quit because the story ended, for all intents and purposes, with the death of Arthas. All content since has been lame.
---
Yeah, I take offense to seeing blood elf and weeb in the same sentence. Nothing weeby about them, just some pretty boys with green eyes. :)
---
It’s sooo good!
---
Retail has a lot of conveniences but those conveniences have cost us that sense of community.
---
Things like phasing help tell a more immersive story but it separates us l. The auto-group finder makes it so much easier to play with people even from other servers but we can’t form any real lasting connections when everything is so automated.
---
While there are some things that are great that they added, they may have added too much conveniences we have lost so much in the process. We lost the core feeling of being in an MMO.
---
While personally I'd sooner say I was from Norrath than any place on Azeroth, this post made me uncomfortably emotional - it never ceases to amaze me, how common our experiences can be despite how radically different the conditions of our lives are.

---
You’re not going to get 5k. Maybe 1k in 6 months to a year or so. 
---
I was very into the AH back in the day. Even during TBC it was only fetching a few hundred gold. 
---
While being the only epic pet in the game and crazy rare, there are no pet battles or pet journal to keep them in, so it’s just cosmetic, and people will grind the pet out before laying out a guild bank of gold on it.
---
Do yourself a favor. Be the man! Use that booger and keep him out all the time!
---
Gondola operator?
---
LFD had its uses, and I prefer locked communities.
---
BRE is mainly a pvp weapon, arguably the best pvp weapon in the whole game for warriors(except for Might of Menethil)
---
Any BoE that's worth any amount of gold is always a NEED.  The other way this isn't a thing is when you are playing with a full group of friends.
---
How is it fair if a 100g boe drops that someone gets to need an equip it in a pug?  If he wins it he can equip it if not everyone contributed to the clear and has an equal right to get the item to use or sell.
---
idk about that but a skull undead mage only resisting what, 2 spells from a 20 dosent feel right
---
Im confused but dont you think its a bit early for a plants to cost over 100g? Im fairly sure its still a bit early for a flast to go for over 100g
---
Imbalance faction only really matters for world pvp, so it comes down to how much world pvp do u want to do? also affects farming area's for professions etc. as you get ganked and can be frustrating for vast majority of people
---
One thing to consider tho is alot of people rn are forming cleave groups to spam level in dungeons, so this negates the impact of world pvp as you're likely not going to see the opposing faction from anywhere between level 30-45 (or wherever cathedral stops becoming good for xp)
---
Maraudon is an instance in Desolace and princess is the highest boss. That means the lower area of that instance will be skipped.
---
LFD on a locked server would have been killer.
---
Not with a cam though, and coincidentally he uses a cam on his streams now...so who knows
---
Black lotus were worth very little for like half of vanilla because flasks didn't last through death. After they started lasting through death they were 20-40g on every server I ever played on.
---
Nope still a clown
---
The first part of Legion was super. The second part was shitty in the exact inverse proportion.

Dude he's 7 levels above me. As soon as he charged from his fucking mount my mind was 100% run away. I knew I could do that in the water. My focus was that water.

You’re assuming way too much. Sure, Iran is very backwards, aggressive, and a radical state. However America did prop up a dictator there which fueled this fire. And yes, the current administration has been a lot more harsh with passing sanctions on Iran so they were literally pushed by the United States like I said. Stop assuming shit.

Shoutout to Bowsandhoes and Scratchnsnif for rescuing our party of under-levelled allies in stranglethorn vale. Defended us the entire journey.

Based off the 20 memes daily that say the same thing, yes.
---
Warrior prot isn't really meant for grinding 3+ mobs out in the world, but you can do that in any spec as long as you have a friend. Its main concentration is making regular dungeon runs and many pvp situations a lot easier. 
---
For focusing on counter-ganking, I always pick up:
---
-Improved Revenge (basically a 3 second stun on demand against melee)
---
-Improved Shield Bash (can catch most mid-tier mages completely off guard, and great against spriest)
---
For Shield Slam, I typically respec at 40 to grab it. It can deal really good burst, and can even dispel vital buffs (ice armor!!! ice barrier!!!)
---
Storyline contributed a lot to the decline, as that's essentially the end of the story. I'd be fine with non-cross-realm LFD.
---
They don't even have heterochromia!

[this is unironically my inventory](https://prnt.sc/p681ij) as a lvl 43 war going through STVietnam for the 2nd time, i literally gargle so much drugs i turn into a witcher like geralt.
---
I out range the boulder, and when the boulder does hit me, I cancel cheetah before the dmg hits me to avoid the daze.
---
What we used to do in vanilla is irrelevant.
---
Doesn't change the fact that someone could have easily hit need instead.
---
I'll agree with you brochacho
---
New to this game. Picked a human rogue. Can somebody link me a guide to leveling, gear, questing, etc..? 
---
I feel like I'm drowning. Theres so much shit to do and I don't know what is neccesary and what is a complete waste of time. Please help
---
Same parroting on that matter
---
Wow have not seen this in a long time.
---
The first half was so good. The second half was excrement.
---
We don’t 
---
Without layering it becomes multiple times slower than it was in vanilla
---
Nah. TBC was ugly, tedious, and boring.
---
This wasn't well known enough for them to have actively fixed it.  I'm betting they accidentally fixed it with how the imported the old data in the modern engine.
---
Still, it's a real shame.  Makes broken tooth the only viable pvp pet in phase 1 now.
---
On the real!
---
Lol you guys are so dumb. Stay mad noobs.
---
Just take your time and know what you're doing. Sounds silly like there isn't, Just breathe when someone opens on you, check CD's, Decide on next step. 
---
It'll get easier and you'll get better and better, especially with prediction too. So again, Practice.
---
Underappreciated zone, one of my favorites. Nice screencap.

I used to make millions of gold just playing the ah in retail years ago, but that isn't really doable until you have some money already and the ah is also very volatile right now. So while you're leveling it's more about slowly and steadily building bank without splashing it on all kinds of non-essential things. 
---
I just hit 31 and have about 40g by selling literally everything (have herbalism and skinning). I have a bank character placed in a big city so I just mail everything that isn't junk to the bank and sell it at the ah. 
---
You say you vendor green and white items, stop doing that. Never vendor green items, and only vendor white items if their ah value -cut is less than vendor value, which it rarely is. Green items will always be worth something due to the DE value, even if the stats are awful, and items with decent stats are worth way more than their vendor value. 
---
Most money (unless you get lucky with BoEs) comes from white items which are mats for all sorts of things, and therefore you should never sell anything without finding out what it's worth. You can't rely on getting BoE items that you can sell for 100+ goal because that's unlikely to happen, you just have to get the most return on the items you do get and for that, vendor is not the best option (my only non-green BoE so far was a cloak worth half a gold, and my highest selling auction so far was 95s). 
---
Generally post items at short duration and then repost 2 hours later is far more effective (and cheaper) than posting them 8 or 24 hours, but ofc you also have to repost them more as you're not going to find a seller for every item in 2 hours. 
---
You can probably take advantage of the fact you have leatherworking, but as I'm not too experienced in that department I'll refrain from giving you advise that might be wrong.
---
Interesting. Can you screen shot the ui with it?
---
Would you able to share the steam link controller setup? I think those are exportable, this setup fixes all the problems I encountered trying this the last time a thread like this showed up
---
I’ve soulstoned so many random people instead of myself over the last two weeks.
---
Hahahahahahahaahaha what a loser.
---
Yeah it feels like theres a way bigger imbalance on that server
---
I'm not saying I want it that way. I'm saying it is that way. The fact that theres a definition from dictionary.com or it has greek roots doesnt fcking change that. In English it means the mental illness, nothing else. I literally said in my posts that theres no other correct usages, yet you act like my argument is about what I want. Lol
---
They patched it right? I thought you could only layer every 3 hours or something. Did you do this before then?
---
I'm rational, you're being a child.
---
When you say game design, you must mean LFD.
---
I only like the concept of LFD in a locked community. 
---
Premise, lore, aesthetic, raidng, etc WOTLK beats the stew out of BC.
---
What's sleep?
---
I feel yoyr pain
---
No, it turns out that Sunken Temple quests aren't in phase 1, but they will be in phase 2. So you'll probably see questie saying that quest is available but it's not yet. The same with "An Imp's request".
---
I for one appreciate that I don't have to `/cancelaura [form:2] Bear Form, [form:3] Cat Form`... For every single macro and can use `/cancelform`. Otherwise, I agree that we shouldn't be limited in the way you're describing.
---
Now i'm curious as well
---
New patch?
---
Level BS or QQ.
---
My server is leaning horde by about 4k. My dwarf Hunter calls
