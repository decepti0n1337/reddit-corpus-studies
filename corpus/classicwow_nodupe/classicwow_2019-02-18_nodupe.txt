I always just did 1g. To hijack this thread with my own question though, if I had a warlock alt, where would be the best place to put them as a summoning slave?

---
True story: I didn't know black lotus existed for my first year with my herber because they were farmed so heavily that I never found one.
---
I played horde side, and the best place to set up a portal business is kargath. That's just a lot of time standing by the mailbox spamming when someone hearths in. It's not bad if you are doing something else like watching TV or something but otherwise it's just not engaging. If you duel or walk away to farm nearby another mage is going to take your spot. But otherwise it's great for passive income
---
Mage: Shatter, AP, Combustion, PoM, Pyro
---

---
Tactical nuke on anyone.
---
It's less common because you'd need two people with you in order to summon. Maybe brm and later on silithus would work. 
---
The most haunted place on Azeroth. Ghosts everything, just waiting..
---
Think 1g is about the rate really after a few months. It's not a fun way to make money though is it...
---
2004-2010 was the wow golden age. 
---
Vanilla TBC Wrath are all great. 
---
I was a fan of using that engineering wand that turned them into a leaper gnome which auto-dismounted them.
---
I used to run a prot/holy pally in BGs where people would spend a lot of time trying to kill time trying to kill me while I healed.  I'd wait up until I had a stack of 5 and then sometimes kill people when they were at lower than half health.  It only really worked because they didn't expect a prot pally to suddenly burst them down.
---
PoM Poly worked too, iirc. 
---
i would charge 1g but for some reason i am always out of runes :(
---
Vanilla BC and Wrath crew need to join forces. We are all on the same team 
---
do it for free and everyone will love you.  they can tip if they want 
---
Very possible during the Cataclysm
---
That‚Äôs why I go desolace and Feralas, so I can quest and 1v1 as I see opposing faction rather than hide from higher levels or get gabled by pairs of people. 
---
I used to do it for tips and most people tipped 50s to 1g.  It's not a good way to make money.
---
Likes similar to the WCIII version
---
Belf was sort of ok, but not that good. Dranei was laughably bad.
---
I chill there as a 60 ally but I only fight other high llvls
---
I do get a kick out of seeing horde run up and come to a dead stop with me targeted. I wait a bit before I /wave 
---
&gt;PVP:
---
This is correct.  The horde has better cohesion than the alliance thus they roll PUGs, but pallys used right are OPed in PvP and alliance pre-made groups are very , very good.
---
&gt;PVE:
---
PvE tends to be harder for the horde.  Horde also tends to have fewer mages due to the lack of a good looking mage race.  On the other hand horde attracts older players which results in better over all raid groups than the kids the alliance tends to get.
---
Not gonna happen for the first month or so, the foot race will have people (mostly) on even ground 
---
Did the OP you replied to edit in the final point 'while they just beat on me and I dont die'?
---
Because that's the difference between retail and vanilla. You get hit once or twice and you're in trouble.
---
What guild are you in?
---
Thanks man, i'll level up a pally then. 
---
STVietnam
---
They can also sleep beats and dragonkin
---
Depends on where your guild tells you to put them. People  dont do it on private servers because multibox isnt allowed.
---
You also didn't say what faction you were on, but alliance doesn't really have a need for people spam selling summons because they get around so easy.
---
Further, a mage sitting in kargath (the best place for someone to sell portals) still makes significantly less than any other method of farming gold.
---
Hey classic warcraft had northrend! Classic wow just removed it
---
#noonerememberswc3
---
I really think there's just too much talk of min/maxing.
---
I plan on leveling tailoring/enchanting on my warlock main, switching to skinning/leatherworking on a shaman, and BS/mining on a warrior, and I plan on doing it as I level.  Why?  Because it's more fun.  And that's what I plan on playing the game for.
---
PvP servers add a constant element of danger when doing everyday things.  
---
For example, earlier I was leveling mining on my 53 orc hunter when a shadow melded 60 NE hit me with scattershot, dropped a freezing trap on me and got ready for aimshot.  So I sicked my pet on her to delay the aimshot, trap broke and I FDed before she could hit me with aimshot.  I then hit bestial wrath and we nuked it out.  I won with 120ish HP left.  Now I don't always beat those gank attempts, but when I do, it feels great.  For the rest of the ore farming, I was on the lookout for this hunter so I could get the drop on her next time.
---
A lot of people will pick the opposite faction just to kill said streamer, I'd wager.
---
Orc rogue is not objectively better than undead rogue in pvp.
---
Basically it makes the game feel alive. Killing someone that ganked you earlier in another zone, or 3-4 lowbies ganging up to take down a high level ganker, or making a group to take down 2 rogues running around killing people are the experiences that make the long slow drag of levelling worth it to me. Yes it's annoying sometimes, but in levelling to 60 you probably spend less than an hour being really frustrated by the pvp, but you gain 200+ hours of the world feeling alive and the factions actually meaning something. PvE on the other just feels like you're constantly missing out.
---
I hope you guys know how limited the modern api already is, chances are we won't see any changes to it what so ever and if we do they'll be for the better. 
---
That's always a problem on such servers.  I've always wanted blizzard to implement a faction join limit on them when it gets more than 55-45% imbalanced. 
---
So let‚Äôs say you didn‚Äôt win. And that NE hunter kept killing you and camping you. Let‚Äôs say none of your friends were online and general chat was empty so you had no backup. 
---
You just cycle through releasing spirit and running back to your corpse. How many times will you do that before it‚Äôs no longer fun being on edge. How many times until you think, I could be farming ore on a pve server right now
---
You did not beat a 60 on a 53, unless this is retail we are talking about. You would have just missed every shot or had small glancing blows. I call bs
---
Local defense was actually used in vanilla
---
Use local defense 
---
Yep and in the first month or two you should definitely consider static vs fluctuating/inflatable costs ie fixed things like training and mount costs are worth ignoring not just early in your levelling process but also early in the game's economy.
---
As more players pump gold into the economy AH prices will slowly increase so buying early isn't really an issue, but would be worth holding onto anything that you think will sell well, at least for a while, unless of course you immediately need the gold for an investment that will pay off even more.
---
So holding onto valuable pieces for a while, as well as at least initially targeting your professions towards selling to hardcore raiders (ie gathering and say alchemy) who will pay stupid ammounts for that initial early push are good ways to accrue mount gold.
---
I remember being cucked when trying to farm for blood troll tusks in STV for days. Just wanted to be fair that no it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúusually‚Äù just last a few hours per 60 levels. 
---
It was mostly low, 3 on all the draw distance sliders, with a few things on high. I don't remember if that was at 1080p or 720p, but either way I know you can turn on FXAA with basically no performance hit.
---
Things get a bit rough with lots of transparency, since the 2400g is going to be amazingly bandwidth limited.
---
This was with 2933MHz CL16 RAM and the stock cooler in a really, really small chassis, so nothing exactly exotic.
---
&gt;You would have just missed every shot or had small glancing blows.
---
No glancing blows in PvP and ranged glancing blows are not a thing.  You clearly don't know what you're talking about.

honestly fuck the ore, in 8 months you will remember winning a gank you I still tell stories about some of my pvp escapades to people 15 years later. I can't even begin to remember how many ore's ive farmed but I can tell you my friends and I don't sit around talking about "Oh man you remember that one time we farmed so much ore?" Because the game isn't about farming ore. Its about cultivating experiences and having fun.
---
My favorite part is that I can kill any horde in my way while I‚Äôm questing, or gathering or whatever I need that I don‚Äôt want them to have. If a horde is looting a gromsblood ahead of me I will fight them to the death for it! Or those damn stealth panthers that are so hard for me to find, I play nice until they tag something ahead of me.
---
On a pve server I have to share, no thanks. Kill or be killed.
---
Yeah i played on Alliance with Netherguard   
---
Great group of people.
---
PvP servers aren't for everyone. I don't really understand what you're trying to achieve with this thread other than establishing that differences in opinion exist.
---
Ore is meaningless if it took you no effort other than running around like a bot to get.
---
Not if they were in the air, that‚Äôs why I had to buy the wand schematic.
---
I can see that. Killing to preserve control over a spawn
---
That sort of thing happened in vanilla, people were keyboard turners and clickers. I drowned a lvl 60 rogue once on a 30-39 ish druid once, and remember fighting several lvl 60s(Not at once just during the un'goro leveling process) as a 52ish in un'goro as a duo and occasionally solo. 
---
Find somewhere else? Do dungeons, chill out. Thr quest is not the end all and sometimes we can't do every quest that holds us back.
---
Genuinely trying to understand why people think it‚Äôs the best and only way to play. If people are going to trash me for playing on a pve server, I‚Äôd like to know why
---
Except no one is trashing you for playing on a pve server, just explaining why they prefer pvp servers. Its simply about memories. You also seem to have this idea that its all culminated around leveli g and getting ganked, but truthfully it adds a ton more battlegrounds to the world - its why southshore vs tarren mill ever even became a thing.
---
OMFG!!! I can't believe this is happening right now... I'm shaking!!! Two things:
---
**1) I have spent the better part of the last fifteen years hating you two (Bove and Hatrix). I say "better part" not because I've stopped hating you since, but because I only started hating you circa 2006.**
---
**2) One of my favorite and best all-time WoW memories was because of you !@#@\^&amp;\* scumbags.**
---
**Story time!!!**
---
**Chapter 1**
---
...All this happened, more or less. The Molten Core parts, anyway, are pretty much true...
---
The year was 2006, and the guild I was in with Nailo, Pyrie and Rawk - \[The Defiant\] - fell to pieces. Nailo, who had become our GM, was a much better player than most of us, and though he tried to carry our heavy asses through ZG as a bear tank, it just wasn't working. I still remember how disappointed and ashamed I felt as he broke the news in Ventrilo, explaining that we would be all right without him, something which we all knew was not true. I remember even thinking that he might have stayed if I was only a better player (I mean, come on man, I was 14 and played a huntard). Heartbroken and dismayed, the rest of us scrubs did what any real OG Vanilla player did in such circumstances: we cauterized the wounds, dusted ourselves off after a lengthy Ventrilo cry, and went back to the grindstone with grit and determination.
---
Enter \[Veng√©ance\] -- our new ticket to Molten Core and phat lewtz, our new hope. We were a disparate group of ragtag veterans from failed guilds who had a new sense of appreciation for raiding and guild cohesion. Though none of us said it, we each knew that we needed to git gud fast or else we would find ourselves in a Nailo 2.0 situation, guildless and forever condemned to wear Tier 0.
---
**Chapter 2**
---
\[Veng√©ance\] was reluctantly led by a country-redneck-by-day-Orc-Warlock-by-night named \[Thulsdoom\]. He had a no nonsense kind of approach when it came to loot drama and tactics, which made him a good leader at the time. Anyway, we were progressing along quite well until one day when we walked into Molten Core and could only zone 38 people in. The final two were trying to get in, but -- lo and behold -- it said the instance was full. Strange behavior, but classic WoW was full of stranger things, we thought.
---
While the last two kept repeatedly attempting to zone in, the main group proceeded into the instance. The main tanks and hunters began to pull some molten giants -- but -- what was this? -- out of nowhere an unknown, unguilded duo of strangers were running straight at the raid with a collection of core hounds and giants in their wake. SPLAT, SPLAT! Dead. The raid, including the two griefers, was flattened.
---
Ventrilo became an exploding pinata of curses and insults: "WTF! How the &amp;(#% did they get in here? Who the \_&amp;\*( invited these !@#hats!?!? Why the !#\*&amp; are they pulling?!?! How the @#$\^ did they get saved to our raid?!?"
---
Needless to say, we tried to zone in a few more times and pull some packs, but !@#%ing Bove and Hatrix were always waiting there, ready to pull every mob in sight and wipe the raid.
---
We called the raid off.
---
**Chapter 3**
---
What proceeded for the next several days, and maybe even weeks, was one of the following scenarios:
---
1) We would raid on Tuesday with our full 40 and we would progress as far as we could. Since we knew that someone in the guild was letting them into our instance in the middle of the night and saving them to our Raid ID, we could at least raid for one day without any trouble.
---
2) We would station "watches" where we would keep an eye on the location of guildies, seeing who was in Molten Core and doing an around-the-clock /who check on Bove and Hatrix. Like McCarthyist America, we eventually narrowed down a list of 5-10 guildies who could be in on the ruse with them.
---
3) We would write pleading notes to the GMs, begging for assistance to shut down these griefers. They literally told us no. It was our problem. (These kinds of situations will be interesting to see play out in Classic, as we will have very little to no GM assistance). One of the most iconic moments of the whole ordeal came while \[Thulsdoom\] was filling out a message to the GMs. Hatrix recorded him on Ventrilo and then saved one of my all-time greatest WoW moments for all eternity: 
---
[http://thulsdoom.ytmnd.com/](http://thulsdoom.ytmnd.com/)
---
Thulsdoom, the most laid back, beer-and-bourbon-drinkin', hog-huntin' good ol' boy was ready to throw in the towel. I distinctly remember him saying that if something like this was happening to a high profile guild like \[Dark Apocalypse\] then the GMs would be all over it. To this day, I think he was right.
---
In Nerf Sap 1 Happyminti literally [beats a 60 at level 51](https://youtu.be/Xnww5gc0Kc4?t=33s), and later at [level 52](https://youtu.be/Xnww5gc0Kc4?t=4m56s). A friend of mine who loved to duel kept in the 49 bracket for ages and spent a fair amount of time dueling 60's and winning a number of them.
---
PvP misses/resists really aren't that big of a deal, and more than anything the level of bad that some players are is just mindblowing.
---
**Chapter 4**
---
For several long weeks, we tried a variety of methods to sniff out the mole in our midst, all to no avail. We had one final Molten Core scheduled. "I hate to do it," Thulsdoom explained to me in a whisper, "but after tonight I am going to have to disband the guild." I felt the lump coming back to my throat; another waste of time, another failed guild, another fruitless hope, I thought. He asked me to keep it private, that he would break the news to everyone after the raid in the small chance that they would forget to pester us that night.
---
We entered Molten Core that night with hopeless delusion. It was the sort of delusion a wounded animal feels with seconds to live, imagining that the bloody claws will somehow release from its neck and let it walk away in peace. Instead, as all such animals do, we felt the fatal fangs snap into our veins. There they were: \[Bove\] and \[Hatrix\]. Inside again. Waiting.
---
**Chapter 5**
---
Thulsdoom began messaging me. "Sorry, friend, but I think it's over. We had a good run." With burning cheeks, the entire conversation began playing through my mind. In a few moments, I would be back to square one, listening to an exasperated guild master assuring us all that we would land on our feet one day. How many of my friends would be split up this time? Would I even want to find another guild? Should I just quit playing altogether? I started clicking through my spellbook and bags in denial, idiotically imagining some miraculous answer to be found there. That's when, by some miracle, I did.
---
"One second," I whispered Thulsdoom. "Let me try something."
---
**Chapter 6**
---
As I ran up to our next trash pull, I saw Bove and Hatrix off to the side. They were waiting -- dutifully as always -- for us to pull before they would grab the next packs of mobs. As I called out into Vent that I was pulling, I quickly changed out of my gear, donning only the [\[Ripped Ogre Loincloth\]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=15794/ripped-ogre-loincloth). I told the raid to back up and threw on Aspect of the Cheetah. Bove and Hatrix had grabbed their own set of mobs by this point and were trying to lead them back to the raid. I, however, did not lead my giant to the raid, and Thulsdoom immediately commanded everyone to stand down. Instead of kiting back to my group, I made a bee-line for the pair of limaceous invertebrates. While a prey may sometimes be smart and slippery, a good hunter will always track it down eventually. As I neared the reprobate duo, my heart began racing. "Please don't fail, please don't fail, please don't fail," I began muttering with increasing tension and excitement. Now, the moment was ready! The trap was complete! With the experience of many days, I held shift, hit '2' to go to my second action bar, and pressed the '5' key. As the giants began to swing at me, my troll hunter grunted painfully and seized up, his arms clasping his heart as he fell to the ground in a limp bundle. I shrieked in real life and sank down into my chair. For all intents and purposes, both in game and in real life, I was dead. I removed my hands from the keyboard so as not to cancel the spell. As I watched everything unfold on my screen, my eyes widened and my heart began pounding with glee: SPLAT, SPLAT! Dead! The two griefers were flattened! SUCCESS!
---
With the euphoric anticipation of a small child on Christmas day, I waited for the monsters to return to their positions. The second that they did, I popped up from my Feign Death and immediately began unwrapping my loin-covered package upon their dead faces. Up, down, up, down, up, down -- again and again I pressed 'x' and watched my troll perform squatting gyrations all over their corpses. I copied and pasted /spit and began mixing it into my workout routine. Growing tired of steeping in my salivary teabags, the perverse pair released their spirits and we entered our final two raiders, effectively locking them out of the night's raid.
---
**Chapter 7**
---
In the glory of my loincloth, the coming-of-age ritual was complete: I was no longer a huntard like in the days of Nailo, but Holyfire, Troll Hunter, slayer of dragons and master of the World (of Warcraft)!, and -- above all -- savior of the guild! Ventrilo burst into curses again, this time triumphantly. Many variations of "GET PWNED B!#@\*\*$!!!" were said. We raided the rest of the night without incident.
---
As the story goes, Thulsdoom was actually personally threatened by Bove and Hatrix (or vice versa), and their personal information was apparently disclosed to each other. Thulsdoom, being a crazy Kentucky boy well-versed in shooting shotguns, claims to have scared them off for good after messaging them confirmation of their real names and addresses. Whether that was true is the stuff of legends. As for me, I like to think that it was a puny and desperate hunter from Sin'Jin Village who saved the guild that day.
---
\~Fin\~
---
Can someone explain wtf was going on there? I definitely got murdered in that area back in the day but I didn't realize it was *a thing*.
---
Sure, we can be friends... if you're planning on playing horde, that is.
---
I get bored too easy on PvE servers.
---
To me they seem pointless.  Standing next to my mortal enemy with no ability to fight them is dumb and unrealistic. 
---
Not in this thread, but the general opinion everywhere (reddit, YouTube, twitch, discord) is that if you play on pve, you‚Äôre doing it wrong and you are just not good enough for pve. Like why would you ever play on pve, that‚Äôs just terrible. 
---
I recently got to lvl 60 on a very popular and hostile new pvp server (had 4-6k players and I was levelling right in the bulk of it) and I think there's only 2 occasions in 240 hours levelling that I really got slowed down or seriously inconvenienced by gankers. Yes you die a bit during STV/Tanaris, but more often than not that's a 2-3 min corpse run to get going again. It's very rare and unusual for someone to purposefully camp you for 15+ mins, and even if they do you nearly always can hearth/escape if you really want to - and if you can't you can just stop playing and go do something else, or level an alt.
---
For dedicated premade groups I would say it shouldn‚Äôt matter. Both factions have slight differences but with people who know what they are doing you see the benefits in either side as long as you make groups around them.
---
Now for random pugs, I would say alliance has an easier time in pve. Pally buffs are simple, and for example Druid tanks are easier on alliance (anything below BWL where they are good) because they benefit from pally buffs and not stuff like wind fury. If you are a solo playing Druid tank life is easier on alliance.
---
And for horde solo wpvp is easier for an undead or orc. Because yes those racials can save your life.
---
Noteworthy to mention if you want to play strictly 2h dps warrior, you will see better numbers on horde if you stick with a shaman.
---
All classes would be strong, but damn would warrior be some fun!
---
Mortal Strike + BloodThirst on diff cds would be nutty and unhealable. An orc warrior would have 40% stun resist lol. The warrior would have a 5 second stun and a 3 second silence with a 13 second disarm.
---
Death wish + Sweeping strikes?!?! With enrage, flurry, sword spec/hoj procs, etc.
---
In trouble? No problem. Just pop your 16 second shield wall (75% damage reduction) and last stand for 30% hp.
---
I never played live, but if you quested here on a private server, then it was fight after fight due to high population. It was a constant brawl with high level ganks and  it honestly felt like a war. My favorite zone. 
---
The problem with free is that the reagents add up pretty quickly.  20s each portal I think.  
---
&gt; So let‚Äôs say you didn‚Äôt win. And that NE hunter kept killing you and camping you.
---
Not possible. Because A) I carry invisibility potions mostly to escape group attempts at corpse camping and B) it's not hard to escape a solo corpse camp using terrain, CC, and other tricks.  Learning how to do it isn't hard.
---
&gt;How many times will you do that before it‚Äôs no longer fun being on edge. 
---
When I was first leveling wow, a horde group camped me in Tanaris where there's no real terrain I could use to escape it.  Group 7 or 8 60s and I was 50 or so. I didn't carry invisibility potions back then, otherwise, I would have popped one, ran, mounted up and headed back to gad.  
---
I realized escape wasn't an option, so I decided to waste their time. So I alt-tabbed and went and surfed the internet. I derped around on the internet for a bit, watched part of a movie and checking back every once in an awhile and after about 30 minutes they left(very dedicated group).  At which point I rezed up and got back to playing.  I'd just managed to make 8 60s waste 30 minutes of their time doing nothing fun while I continued to have fun.  
---
This ganking party left the area after unsuccessfully corpse camping me.  Remember, gankers want the satisfaction of killing you over and over again and when you take that away from them, you've effectively ruined their fun.  Which is why I find escaping/killing/evading gankers so much fun.
---
I play wow to have fun encounters, doing stuff like farming ore is how I fund that fun, but the act of farming is borning.  It's much more exciting when farming leads to PvP which is one of many reasons I love PvP servers.
---
No, sadly.
---
10 levels range worth of quest turnins right next to the entrance to the questing area with the largest population in the game. Basically always destined to be a gangbang if the server population is remotely up there.
---
You do you buddy. No need to be rude. Why? Because everybody enjoys the game in their own way.
---
WoW is a very deep and intricate game and min-maxing everything is very exciting to me and I love when this kind of stuff appears on reddit. Especially while we're waiting for Classic.
---
It's a lower status to play on a PvE server because it's effectively an easier version of wow. 
---
Well it has been 15 years so I guess I forgot glancing don‚Äôt work for pvp. The other comments are saying how dumb people were in vanilla, but you said it happened the other day, and from my experience people playing ‚Äúother‚Äù servers aren‚Äôt brand new players, so I doubt they will be keyboard turning.
---
I still call BS but I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not sure if glancing blows work in pvp, so you could be right there.
---
It makes the world feel more alive to me. It turns a hub of quest objectives/mobs into more than a revolving door of people tagging mobs and looting items, it becomes an active battlefield at the same time.
---
I also enjoy how it brings people together. You may not speak to or team up with the player you run past in STV on a PvE server but in PvP you may need to fight off gankers together or even group up JUST IN CASE to protect yourselves better from enemy players.
---
One thing that I commonly did was stay in group with people I quested with, even after we parted ways and went to different parts of a zone. If one of us got ganked we could help each other out if possible or just know what areas to avoid at that particular time.
---
It makes the world more realistic. You are at war with the other faction. Seeing your enemy out in the world should cause tension, and their should be battles over valuable resources and zones. 
---
You miss out on so much this game has to offer when you play pve server. 
---
I haven't gathered that notion whatsoever and I follow a ton of classic wow information. You seem to be misunderstanding - the point is not "you aren't good enough to world pvp and pve servers are for casuals" - it is "by electing to play on a pve server, you are missing out on a big aspect of world of warcraft and what made it so great, an aspect that was at its peak in classic / vanilla, that being the open world pvp - still, if you want to opt out, the pve server option is available to you, as some humans simply don't enjoy confontation."
---
Just because you fall into that secondary category doesn't mean people are attacking you. 
---
Yep. It depends entirely on if you're facing an opponent who uses stuns or fears.
---
Only an alliance dog can pull out pussy moves like this. 
---
The spell learning part is not quite right. You get to train/upgrade spells every 2 levels only. 
---
Also on the side note: Most of the time you will be far far away from your class trainer. So it's better to look up what spells/upgrades are available for your level as it might be worthless and you will just lose time traveling.
---
This is another thing, assuming that since I don‚Äôt opt to face greater adversity with zero additional reward (pvp servers) that I didn‚Äôt play during actual vanilla. 
---
Alexensuals community definitely shits all over pve players
---
Will never happen as accessibility is one of their pillars of game design
---
Could you give us the original source?
---
I wish this vote with your wallet was a thing more in video games. I hate seeing AAA companies getting away with their total bullshit moves, mostly whit new games. 99% of AAA games are buggy as all hell and nowhere near worth the 70 euro tag (where I live). 
---
Sounds familiar.
---
Hahah. I'm dying. Yeah, I think our guild was named something like Pirates with a bunch goofy ascii characters. I think you'll enjoy this video featuring all of us. I think it even has the Scholomance wiping I mentioned with me booking it out last second around 3:20. The quality isn't that great, but hey, it was over a decade ago.

People were so lazy back in the day. They barely ever flasked only if they absolutely needed it for a hard kill. Compared to today where people pop enough consumables to buy the whole guild epic riding in just one afternoon.

Nost actually buffed the spawn rates. They respawned even slower during actual vanilla. It's not mathematically possible for a server to support every guild flasking each week. That's why no matter where you play they will be relatively expensive.
---
Not true. You leave the starting zone at level 6. This takes an hour (max 2 for new players). 
---
I'm pretty sure anchor weed at the start of bfa had a very similar respawn rate to the lotus and the playerbase hated it lmao.
---
Vanilla was *made* for world PvP. A balanced, populated server that actually took the "Craft" in "Warcraft" seriously? I'll pay $15 a month for that.
---
may as well just bubble, beat them up, and /afk at that point
---
I'm thinking of rolling on an RP-PVP server (probably only 1 or 2 will exist or the population will suffer). I think there will be a higher chances of seeing less common class/race combos. I think it's cool being a less common choice, like a Tauren Hunter or a Troll Warrior.
---
I want this as a poster 
---
I never saw the issue with this though. The whole point was to be more accessible, and you still needed some semblance of competency to complete most of the content (at least until it was farmable). As someone who had been super excited and loved the LFG system (EVERYONE was excited for that) I hate that the LFG system produced LFR and there were no attunement quests, but I felt fine with the loss of the latter at least so people could actually experience content. 
---
LFR was a step too far though, and I still disagree with it. 
---
:D !!!
---
I think the video didn't link for some reason, unless you're still here to troll me 15 years later!
---
To me, vanilla is all about that unpredictable PvP and constant state of danger when you're out in the world. Factions rivalry and open world PvP contribute a ton to making the game feel so immersive and the community so alive.
---
I would be so depressed to level my character without engaging in world PvP a single time while all these enemies are just running around me in the open. So much wasted potential for epic skirmishes and memories, bonding with your faction, making mortal ennemies, being part of the community. 
---
Sure, sometimes you'll get ganked. Yeah, it's stupid that a lvl 60 would even waste his time killing a grey player. Or maybe they got ganked first and came back for revenge, and you're just a casualty of a massive war in the making, involving your whole server, hundreds of players engaging in a battle so big and exciting that you'll remember it for ever as an amazing gaming experience.
---
I usually accept whatever payment they give me if they're sub 60, and if they're 60 the unspoken agreement seems to be 1g.

The PvP servers will inevitably become 90% one faction, just pick the one with the majority faction you want and you're good.

I remember Juggernautx had the massive two-handed sword from ZG and I thought he was ridiculously badass.
---
&gt;from my experience people playing ‚Äúother‚Äù servers aren‚Äôt brand new players
---
You'd be surprised! Especially in recent times, where thanks to Classic it has garnered more attention.
---
Also, people being better players nowadays is an awkward topic. For one I think that most people are overestimating that. But even more so, what people tend to forget is that good players have gotten better as well. Overall I don't believe that the gap between an average player and a good player has changed in the slightest.
---
Heck, once the influx of new players hits its peak on Classic's release, I wager the difference between an average player and a good player will be larger than it was back in actual vanilla.
---
i'm in a wpvp group that frequently kills 60s in stv while most of us were in the late 30s to 50s. even at say, level 40, i was able hit 60s with ranged abilities (as a hunter) and do a bit of damage, so im gonna give him the benefit of the doubt and say he did do this
---
They meant while /sitting.
---
Ability crits like SS should still give a charge while your sitting if it's blizzlike.
---
You can look at it from two perspectives. World PvP getting in the way of you having fun or world PvP being fun. In my experience, for every one time it got in my way of doing something else I wanted to be doing, there were 10 times it turned into something more fun than I had planned. 
---
If you're unsure which category you fall into I would still suggest PvP because, despite the horror stories you hear, it won't be as frequent as you might think. 
---
&gt;. The other comments are saying how dumb people were in vanilla, but you said it happened the other day, and from my experience people playing ‚Äúother‚Äù servers aren‚Äôt brand new players, so I doubt they will be keyboard turning.
---
Just because someone is experienced doesn't mean they're good at PvP.  
---
I suspected she expected me to try to run away while mounted after she freezing trapped me.  But I died to someone a couple of days ago who did that to me. It's hard to outrun aimshot, autoshot, multishot while undergeared.
---
So I dismounted immediately and used my pet on her which disrupted the pattern she was expecting.  After that it was FD to stop Aimshot, pet erange, pet stun, hit a healing pot and doing my normal DPS rotation.  Fight was over pretty quick.
---
You are in the wrong here, buddy. The guy said that he could pull a pack of mobs and AOE them down without even losing a lot of health while the mobs ARE HITTING him.
---
In Vanilla if you fail to frost nova 1 or 2 mobs from the pack, then your AOE pull will be done for. 
---
It's not possible to pull an entire pack and AOE them down, while they are actually hitting you. I know that from experience. You should know that too.
---
Hype, I'll join. 
---
generally said by people who installed it with a friend to play on every so often 
---
I can't imagine anything I'd rather fight less as a rogue than a dwarf paladin or warrior.
---
Is there going to be an OCE realm?
---
Where‚Äôs your source for vanilla being made with world pvp as it‚Äôs intended ruleset?
---
Portals are 1g and you're just gonna lose money at it, because all that time you just waste in town could be spent *making money.*
---
I don‚Äôt remember it forever as an amazing gaming experience. I remember it for a year or two as a couple nights I wasted trying to farm the materials for my whirlwind axe
---
Youtube doesn't ban videos on private servers so it's unlikely they would ban streams either.
---
So in essence you agree pvp servers are kinda dumb
---
What you're describing really only happens on older, established pvp servers. People have been playing on them for extended periods of time and are bored.
---
On a brand new pvp server, you won't bump into max level people you can't fight against. You can generally fight back against people 5 levels higher than you... not that you will even see that many if you are playing a decent amount of time. And if you do see the, half the time, they ignore you because they are trying to hit 60 and go do their own thing.
---
The exciting part about new pvp servers, is bumping into groups your own level. You're minding your own business in Hillsbrad... get into an occasional fight here and there... and then, the alert goes up in defense chat that someone is being a jerk and camping.
---
A group forms up to kill that guy... he comes back with a group... before you know it... the entire zone is up in arms in what amounts to an open world battleground. It gives a nice little break from the usual level grind and lets you make new friends/enemies.
---
I've personally toured every overworld location on Azeroth, that's my source. I don't know why you're talking about "rulesets" because the only rule in war is "win."
---
STV has a massive level range and it‚Äôs not that high so many people end up there. 
---
One of my favorite too. Such a long journey and that feeling you get when reaching Earthsong Falls after scraping through the muck and slime and then getting to jump in that water. Feels good man. I also healed it a bunch on my shaman and it is exasperating. Especially those damned slimes! Earthbind em and kite, boys! Poison cleansing totem is a godsend here.
---
Its WARcraft.  
---
Okay just wanted to point out your presenting your opinion as fact without any sourced basis. 
---
It's really not that big of a deal. Every race is viable and those "select" race/class combos are just a hair better than the others if played exactly the same.
---
As long as a raid has a couple of Dwarf Priests then they won't care what rave the others are. If you're decent you won't get rejected, good healers are always in high demand.
---
Also, your skill is going to be the end-all-be-all of your WoW experience. You can play any race you want and still a top dog. In my experience, the human fury warriors didn't dominate the meters, the best geared/skilled Warrior did. Picking Human doesn't automatically make you better, you have to be a highly skilled player either way and there's far less good warriors out there than there are human warriors üòÇ.
---
Point I'm trying to make: 
---
Don't pick bases on these minuscule bonuses because they won't make or break your performance. Pick the race you enjoy playing the most, for ANY class.
---

You have *got* to be fucking kidding me. 
---
For leveling, it adds more to do and experience out in the world. I like having moments where I have to run away from a group of hostile players, or where I fight an alliance player over a resource node. I even like the moments where me and an alliance player *could* be fighting eachother, but simply choose not to. It's not always fun, but it keeps the game from feeling static. 
---
Another reason, and this is subjective, is that at max level I want my progression to mean something. Getting better gear and using that gear to get into harder dungeons means absolutely nothing to me. Like, okay, my numbers are higher, but what does that make me next to another player? Gear makes you fight better, but unless you're fighting it's just a collection of items. But on a PvP server, that gear you worked hard on getting absolutely does give you an edge out in the world. You are going to be fighting people and it's not going to be a level playing field, and the desire to get that advantage is what motivates me to play the rest of the game.
---
A topic for Nightmarefuel...
---
Cant wait I was never a high end raider in wow that was far to easy I would camp and pvp all the best spots and I would do it at the same level! Cant wait #thisishowIclassicwow
---
Oh it's there now. Haha.
---
One of the reasons my guild finally got tired of PVP servers and decided to move to a PVE one instead.
---
It‚Äôs just such a foreign concept to me. I pay to play this game unless another player chooses to ruin my fun. Did you know there‚Äôs a type of gamer out there who only enjoys a game when they are ruining other gamers ability to have fun?  Yes an actual published psychological gaming archetype. 
---
Truth.   Vanilla and the first two expansions all had me so excited. Cataclysm is where they lost me for good. 
---
&gt; On the other hand horde attracts older players which results in better over all raid groups than the kids the alliance tends to get.
---
Is this the general consensus? Because when I started playing vanilla as a kid, I chose Horde because all my friends played Horde. The edgy badass undeads, the stoner trolls and the muscle packed orcs were just more attractive than humans, smaller humans and even smaller humans. Nightelves obviously had a huge impact, but did they really make up for it?
---
Not that it'll matter much in classic since the average player will be much older anyway. 
---
Who‚Äôs complaining? I think it‚Äôs great!
---
I would totally buy this if they had it on displates.com
---
Stranglethorn was the go to place to gank some low leveled people for various reasons.  That specific area is a commonly returned to quest turn in/pick up area, thus people camped the shit out of it.
---
Why not? Don‚Äôt they limit character creation on high pop servers? Don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs different. 
---
Shadowmelding for 15 minutes waiting for the right time...
---
Many people including myself ditched at the end of Wrath due to an ungodly content drought 
---
You must not have seen the private server launches. People are packed so tightly together that it'd 100% spread... like... the plague.
---
I mean, okay. But it's not just the act of ruining people's fun, its how the presence of that side of the game impacts everything else. WoW is absolutely a skinnerbox, and in order you get invested you need the right context. On PvE servers (which btw I played on for years and years back in the day) I feel like I'm playing this super time-consuming game basically for its own sake, which isn't satisfying. I'd rather play retail, which has way more fun dungeons and raids and requires much less busy-work. But when world pvp is a factor, it feels like I'm part of something, you know? I like to help people, too. I'd always run dungeons with my friends when they were gearing up long after I'd gotten my stuff from those places, and I had no issue helping people with gold or grinding with them for mats. That's fun, social. And it's even more meaningful to me on a PvP server. 
---
This is exactly what i do throughout the leveling process. I always have hella gold when i hit 60. Grind for those last few levels and youll be sitting on a stack of gold
---
World of *War*craft.
---
There was already a stat squish in the past before that too.. i forget when..
---
&gt;I would add that it's ok to try out many classes to let's say lvl 10 or 15, because then you can make a more informed choice for your real main class.
---
Eh idk. 
---
For sure it's MORE informed, but a lot of classes only get rolling at level 30ish. Many classes mobility, damage, interrupt potential, etc. change a lot between levels 10 and 30 specifically.
---
That being said you'll only really know what you like when you play it, guides can help to a certain extent, but for example, while I find warrior theoretically interesting, the way rage plays out as a resource doesn't feel good to me while playing- for me it feels like it limits far more often than it enhances the experience, but that's only something I learned from playing it to mid 40's.
---
Just by reading all your responses to people replying to your thread, I can tell you're super cucked about people saying you're bad for rolling on a PVE server. It makes me wonder why you made this thread, were you just trying to attract even more of the same attention?  
---
I don‚Äôt get players like you, if I‚Äôm level 45 and you‚Äôre 40 and you‚Äôre taking my quest mobs I‚Äôm going to kill you and it works the other way too. Too many players keep rezing and try to do the same quest that they just got ganked on AGAIN. You gotta go grind somewhere for a little bit for them to finish the quest, or work on a new quest. Sure you will get ganked for an hour if your grinding quest mobs that the other faction wants, you just gotta suck it up and move somewhere else for awhile sure it sucks but that‚Äôs PVP severs.
---
Two sides. Faction war. Pve servers are fine. So I'd easy mode in a single player game. Anyone who shits on you for playing on easy is an asshole. WoW was made to be played on a pvp server just like most video games aremade and balanced around normal difficulty

That's hilarious man, I'm cackling! It's extremely blurry but I can see that I was typing in chat. I'm still in contact with two of the people who were talking in Vent, and I remember all of them.
---
The creepy tween-voiced child was Bashan, a Tauren shaman.
---
The grumpy low-voiced Asian guy was Tsohg, an Orc hunter.
---
The hillbilly was Thulsdoom, of course.
---
The metrosexual sounding guy was Gabrielxx.
---
On fresh servers i set my DND to: "2 gold portals | 1g per stack of food or water" so people leave me alone in the FLOOD of people wanting cheap transportation and sustenance.
---
Sometimes ill be nice and give free portals / food to gnomes or dwarves, but it ends up clearing a lot of the rabble and making a fair amount of money early on.
---
&gt;Right now, you can disenchant practically everything because that's what Live has become
---
Well this is awkward. 
---
STV was a great zone to level in for a large range of levels with many quests and bases/camps for both factions. Due to both factions having camps, additional neutral camps (like Nesingwary), flight paths/boats/zeppelins for easy access, and the neutral city of Booty Bay, it became the beginning of many player's engagement in constant PvP while leveling because of the intermixed Horde and Alliance. Prior to this many players are coming from zones that are strictly controlled by Horde or Alliance and you wouldn't see many other players of the opposing faction. By this level you will be familiar with your character and it really puts you to the test, as moving forward zones are mostly neutral and really give that sense of adventure and always watching your back (PvP server). With the large level range between northern and southern STV it was common to see players many levels higher than you as well, hence getting camped and many players having a terrible time simply trying to turn quests in.
---
It is definitely *a thing*!
---
Back in the retail days Alliance had more PvE focused players than Horde did until WotLK when they gave Humans Every Man For Himself.
---
The reality is that both factions have great PvP racials. Dwarves can dispel blind and viper sting, gnomes can remove slows and roots, humans are god tier stealth detectors thanks to Perception, Catseye Ultra Goggles and Catseye Elixir. Night Elves... get a participation trophy.
---
Fair enough 
---
You no longer need Salvation in today's meta, this is a shadow of the past.
---
If you're playing with good players, Horde&gt;Alliance all the way.
---
guess so, but its not like it's that hard to make gold after like lvl 40 
---
Lol!! I'm glad you stopped by North. I'll be playing mage this next go around. I liked your session with Josh on Countdown to Classic.
---
I'll even fix it just for you. &lt;3
---
But why would you willingly submit yourself to that when you could just as easily *not* play on a pvp server lol. Like there‚Äôs so much added risk and no additional reward
---
Oh, I'm so sorry! It just seemed like you looked at my picture because you thought it was legit fingernail art, got upset, and decided to attack me over my mistake. Way too many toxic people online. 
---
Thank you for liking it though. 
---
My roommate and I did Druid/Rogue and it was a pretty potent combination. We could both stealth which was great, then he could HOT himself and go bear while I shanked things from behind repeatedly. Or he would just stay cat and we'd shred things.
---
Lol, that was me today .  Waiting to spawn in so I can turn in quests and bounce.
---
Weren't the Eastern kingdoms originally referred to as "Azeroth?"
---
Risk in and of itself is fun.
---
I always enjoyed the added fear and excitement. Being an ally rogue on a pvp server in STV was the most fun I had in WOW even though I got ganked a ton. Leveling on a pvp server is just meh, there is no risk.

Troll sword rogues look cool as fuck, albiet the weakest pvp race you dont have to deal with orcs as one at least
---
Two more expansions to go until Eastern Kingdoms gets shoved onto the Outland Map.
---
Best part is, there were two of these. The first wasn't so bad because there were 3 or 4 other quests to gather tusks, ears, and skulls from the same mobs so you could possibly get quite a bit done while completing those. The later one was getting items from the skullsplitter trolls which were tougher and often times in tighter packs, sometimes with tiger pets. I always do them for the sheer exp and cloth etc drops but yeah. It can be a slog.
---
tauren warrior is the best tank, and its even the best for pvp.  You underestimate the value of that extra bit of hp
---
Someone else posted the top map around here with the intention of fixing retail's land masses back to vanilla lore proportions - Kul Tiras and the Broken Isles going back to island status, Northrend going back to being huge and so on. I don't think anyone got the point though.
---
Warrior + roots
---
Top reason I won't be playing on a pvp server.  :)
---
It's not passive income though? You have to actively do it whilst you could be farming somewhere else. 
---
Still have avs and 30 man raids. It should be a good enough barometer 
---
Very well said sir
---
At a base clock with good ram - at least 8gb of 3000mhz -  you'll probably dip no lower than 50 fps anywhere outside of raids and city hubs. The 2400g is capable of 40-45fps in GTAV on all high settings with a surplus of ram, so I wouldn't worry with that setup if I were you. 
---
He removed all his videos and plans to start content again when classic is rolling. This (bootleg) video is probably what you wanna see: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av24724879/
---
Ha ha I killed so many in STV while leveling and with my 60s. I got killed plenty too so I don't feel bad at all. World PvP encounters are some of my best memories in-game. Even getting killed was satisfying if I could get away. Worst case log onto an alt. Best case bait the enemy until my friends arrive to help.
---
Haha thanks man, enjoyed the read.
---
Enjoy mage, shit's ridiculous.
---
True, it's not passive in the same sense as a transmute CD or something. I could have worded that better. Maybe inactive income.  I meant you could be watching TV or hanging around a hub at the auction house and still be able to pick up some cash. I never advertised selling portals but it didn't stop people from buying ports or water from me. 
---
Do you mean use x as in sitting for crit from mob?
---
Yeah i see what you mean 
---
I'd be an incredibly cautious Sub rogue and I'd only fight neutral mobs like Zehvra one at a time. You'd never catch me without my cooldowns. I'd build a PVP  build but I wouldn't actually fight anyone because I'd not a psychopath. I probably wouldn't run dungeons ever. Alternately I'd run a healer. People would adore healers.
---
Yes it is, just like Orc Warrior is better than UD Warrior in PvP. The prevalence of UD Rogues on pservers just shows that people don't worry about min-maxing nearly as much as flavor and I think it'll be even more true for Classic.
---
There are many more stuns than fears in WoW.
---
I think warrior should go up on this list.  Warriors had an extra talent point for some reason during some patch, and it made them totally busted in pve (it got them an extra X1 talent).  While one talent point wasn't enough to break much in pvp, arms and fury definitely have some synergy.  
---
As to the top of your list, I'm not sure how to sort that 1-3 list.  Mages seem to synergize real well, but warlocks like, all the trees mostly work together.  By comparison, rogues really only have one truly meaningful 31 point talent (premed isn't terrible, but vigor sure is), but everything pretty much makes you punch harder in combat and assassination, and having those talents plus prep really does seem like it would be top notch- I'm just not sure it would stack up next to that lock uberspec.  
---
Well thought out list.
---
I dont mean to nitpick but I'd wager one would go for more like 15k per. Nobody wanting to buy it would drive that 100k down hard, unless you're on a realm with a hardcore guild, which definitely would rather spend the money elsewhere and farm em. I dont even know why I wanted to say this but enjoy reading this waste of space!
---
For the Hordiance!
---
I've heard Paladins generate half threat with healing any idea if this is true?
---
True
---
I hate to admit it, but I just learned about Black Lotus a few weeks ago. I thought it was a rare drop from Purple Lotus. I was never an herber but goodness I can name every crafting material from every xpac from the top of my head, this stuff sure made me look dumb!
---
Agree to disagree.
---
3-5 months is much more realistic 
---
The content in WotLK was amazing. It was more the constant changes to classes, gear, skills, etc. that hampered the experience. This was when Blizzard began their crusade against fun
---
Because it's fun and more rewarding. 
---
Look what they did to my boy...
---
That was one of the few quests in WoW that actually got me engaged.  And made Tirion Fordring into my hero, because he just wrecks a pack of 60 elites like it's nothing.  At least, when I did it in Vanilla, because I just hid in the hills while all the fighting was happening.  On the private server I played on, you couldn't hide in the hills.
---
Priest is really great. Lots of fun, great at endgame healing or pvp, the most diverse healing kit. Paladin is really good but very boring to level. Druid is good and not many people play them, but also takes a bit more time to get good at
---
I‚Äôm really keen to see what you come up with for WPL - my first character (warlock) hit 60 in Andorhal! (Specifically killing a ghoul near the house that chromie is in). Anything around that area would be pretty much an insta-but from me!
---
That's really cool, I wonder if it might be actually in the game and just unaccessible.
---
Warlock would be an absolute nightmare is the best possible way
---
It is definitely *not* "just like Orc Warrior".  
---
You're free to prefer orc rogue.  But undead rogue trivializes any opponents with fear, charm, or sleep.  Sleep mattered more in the early patches before they nerfed the sleep dust quest, but charm is part of what amounts to a one-hit combo, and fear is quite plentiful.  You can make the case that a random stun resist is better- it's a reasonable point.  But by no means is orc generally better than undead for rogue pvp.
---
*Wooo* It's your **4th Cakeday** -zerocreativity! ^(hug)
---
I mean, it's fun to help people and get a little profit from it.  Just standing around and waiting for customers, I mean, no, that's not fun, but you're probably doing something else on your main monitor if that's how things are going.
---
The problem is accessibility.  
---
TBC dailies were necessary for grinding gold and mounts.
---
Wrath added one 'necessary' raid-grind rep, that gave you a shoulder enchant.
---
None of the other dailies were needed for anything progression-critical. Their reps provided toys and mounts.
---

Warrior is only slow because you need to reset often to regenerate, which slows down your rage generation, but your uptime scales hard with your rage, meaning with a healer in the back warriors chew through everything super quickly. There is also no leveling content you can't do or need to skip because you can always just grind it out.
---
On top of that you play the two most sought out classes for dungeons, meaning you can pretty much find dungeon groups on demand and finish those sweet dungeon quests quickly and efficiently.
---
Also Priest in solo content isn't slow, it just feels that way but Priests have basically 0 downtime if played right. After 40 they become actually really fast and can handle situations that other classes simply can't.
---
Tough choice. I'm gonna consider what each class has going for it.
---
Hunter: Track Humanoid. Become the world's greatest bounty hunter/person finder. Always know who's around you. Or Track Beast and find people's pets.
---
Rogue: The problem with rogue is that most of their abilities are just shit the average person can do (and the world is worse off for it). I guess having one Vanish would save your ass. I'd just have a hard time not wasting it. I already dither on using it when it's a 5 minute cooldown.
---
Shaman: You'd only need to cast Chain Lightning or Water Walking once to become the greatest cult leader on earth. Or you could bus in thousands of sick people and throw down a disease cleansing totem. With the proper logistics, you can save four terminally ill children every 5 seconds for 2 minutes if the "party" limitation is there. There's factors like are they afflicted by just one disease? etc. IF the party thing isn't there then that's everyone within 29 yards 
---
Paladin: Does anything come close to bubble?
---
Warlock: Yoinking the person of your choice out of detainment or a bad spot with summoning would be pretty cool. 
---
Warrior: Someone more experienced with warriors will have to help me out here. Drawing a blank.
---
Druid: When I turn old and gray, one day I'm just gonna turn into a moonkin. I don't even particularly like moonkins and wouldn't know what I'd do as one, but eh.
---
Priest: Spirit of Redemption. Anyone who kills me will spend the rest of their lives wonder just how cosmically they had fucked themselves. I can fit a lot of bloody oaths of vengeance in those last few seconds. Or if I die peacefully I get one last goodbye to my bewildered loved ones.
---
Mage: I got nothing. Blink? Frostblock?
---
Actually same class/armor type is the least important factor.
---
For a second I thought I was on r/wowcirclejerk
---
Dude imagine 39 coordinated people popping bubble at once if that tank loses aggro. That would be so amazing to see.
---
You could easily recruit warriors and priests if you were so inclined, as well.
---
Ive been max level on a PvP server. What I found was that most of the memorable PvP happened when I was leveling and found other people my level to fight. At max level the world pvp slowed down considerably except outside instance portals for UBRS.

In the world, no one bothers to pick a fight with you when you are clearly in BWL/AQ gear. People seemed to like to only start fights when they felt confident they could win. So once you gear up your main, I hope you have an alt, because people stop initiating combat with you unless its like 3 on 1.
---
It was the opposite for me when I played on a private server. I skipped stv completely because every quest there would be like 5or 6 horde just standing waiting for respawns. 
---
uhm ackchyually... you leave the starting zones at level ~10. No idea how long it takes to lvl to 10 tho.
---
I don't believe Blizzard has stated anything regarding number of Classic servers or their whereabouts.
---
SL orc warlock.  Or orc warrior, really.
---
dude wtf. Are you really that desperate to sell your shit? [smh not even trying](https://imgur.com/a/ulQIpHq) .
---
Imagine an AP POM Fully stacked combustion with shatter pyroblast coming your way. And being able to reset the cooldowns to that shortly after
---
*Red stripe, its beer! Hooray beer!*
---
I don't even bother trying stuns on orcs if I ever face them (I mostly play horde). Warriors can be tough nuts to crack regardless, but I'd probably open with Garrote then Rupture to punch through that armor rather than roll the dice with the stun abilities. I'm with you about the SL warlock though.
---
Get that alliance garbage away from our beautiful horde symbol.
---
Iirc from my old exploration, they don't exist on the Eastern Kingdoms map file for Classic (At least for 1.12), though they are certainly accessible in the Alpha build if you get a sandbox up and running for those. They're pretty hilarious, lots of misplaced Stranglethorn prefabs, bridges all over the place - Clearly not developed further than just a rough shape and some prefabs thrown around. 
---
OP actually talks to himself lol
---
It had a huge effect in PvP because it allowed you to get MS and Deathwish at once. That was what the famous Pat BG video was done with.
---
Oh, I stand corrected.  
---
I still don't think that full talent specs would help warrior as much as the pure classes, but I definitely think warrior is too far down on that list.  
---
Cold Snap only resets Frost spells, it wouldn't refresh AP or PoM.
---
&gt;I really think there's just too much talk of min/maxing.
---
Would you have us stop talking?
---
[removed]
---
Don't know why this has to be about women. It was a gay couple.
---
Maybe some quests. But it is unreasonable to level for 1 month in a group 100% of the time. 
---
I could see people grinding at mobs when their friends are offline. But Wars would be rare because most would simply be the first to die in a dungeon situation. Due to them being a melee class that is tanking the damage. If the heal messes up, your gone. Rip
---
Haha ez tactics.
---
Sneak in as ghost -&gt; rezz -&gt; turn in -&gt; accept follow up -&gt; die
---
Aaand repeat. Needs only quick fingers.
---
If anyone wanta to read quest textes before starting the quests this is officially the end of your WoW carrier. Sorry please try another game
---
this video was amazing. got a legendary neck beard &lt;3
---
Take a shot everytime someone says runescape, osrs or new content.
---
The wow classic drinking game. 
---
And no you will never beat naxx so don't worry about it. 
---
This is why I can't do home office.
---
And stuff like this is why grinding is always better (beside some quests for really good Equip)
---
Was trying to keep the empty area out while zoomed in, last I checked it was wow sub, not a whine how pictures are done sub. 
---
I loved the bug where you could spam it, I used to light up people in area 52. 
---
Another question  
---
How does Redoubt increase your block chance  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20137/redoubt  
---
Assuming i have 8% block chance will it increase me to 10.4% (8%x1.3) or to 38% (8%+30%)
---
I know this, but you can ice block if they try to reflect it and then re nova them
---
Even though Repression isn't that far off just wanted to say the dps spec is called Retribution. It's probably autocorrect but wanted to point it out just in case!
---
Paladin, retri with reckoning. Make macro to sit to stack reckoning stacks, profit.
---
also left after wotlk, but it was because of the class and skill tree changes. i loved my paladin. then they fucked up the whole class with the holy power mechanic.
---
38%.
---
Even though I agree with you, we gotta remember that the game will be based on a previously tested client. Meaning that it has already been tested. Of course there will be changes , and those should be tested but considering this, the beta phase might be really short.
---
Ironically black lotus CAMPING isn't even a thing on private servers because they all use completely custom spawn locations in which there's between 50-100 possible spawn locations in each of the possible zones instead of the usual 5-10 that were in vanilla. 
---
I always try to find a low level mage and overtip them. 
---
Like give them 5-6g and they explode in gratitude. One even added me as a friend to be my ‚Äùpersonal taxi service‚Äù lol. 
---
5g is alot in low 40s
---
This quest taught me how to make macros lol. Thanks thottbot!
---

---
Why not just leave and form a new guild with the 35 or so people you want?
---
I did enjoy this! But mixing up racials having a cast time. Channeling an ability is different than a ‚ÄúRacial with a cast time‚Äù, right? Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Felt cheated there :P
---
Thanks man!
---
I think the rogue talent tree is my favorite in the game. So many goodies and they all compliment each other nicely. I feel like rogue has the most viable specs out of any class.
---
Short, bearded, and loved beer, religion and fishing a little too much. This is basically my crazy uncle from Virginia.
---
To expound on what others have said, nessy was also the best quest hub in the zone. Three separate quest **chains** with multiple steps that all involved killing a static number of mobs, so every part got you XP without grinding for a random drop off mobs (god damn goretusk livers)
---
This is right, arms is best for levelling when you expect wpvp. For an even more PvP focus you can grab imp hamstring for snare (death sentence vs warr) and booming voice to break stealth with demo shout.
---
I'd love to tell you, but my Classic WoW client is currently down.

You‚Äòre right but the stat squishes before, didn‚Äòt entirely ruin the whole item progression in vanilla raids. You still had, not as steep as it was originally, but at least you felt that you get better and more powerful from raidtier to raidtier.
---
it takes slower to level, but the trade off of that is that 1) you get a greater sense of progression 2) there is more depth and complexity 3) the world is relevant below max level and not just at 60.
---
you start out fairly weak, but this means that gear upgrades will have a tangible effect and make you feel more powerful. quests are mostly for green quality items, blues come from dungeons. you still probably can't pull more than one or two mobs at a time without dying, so you have to be careful.
---
while it does definitely depend on the zone, a lot of quests aren't confined to the zone they start in and will send you all over the world. a typical questing zone in classic will have one (maybe two) major quest hubs that will send you all over the zone, and there will probably be other small quests sprinkled around that you can stumble across and/or be sent to by a different zone's quest, eg someone in orgrimmar sends you to hinterlands.
---
you have to train your spells and different ranks of them, some zones have trainers but usually you just go back to the main cities for that. it takes a lot longer to build up a pile of gold. classes are pretty distinct from one another and each one has certain things they can do and will excel at more than others. they are also generally more complex and you will find yourself getting lots of new abilities as you level up. some require reagents or special items (like hunters buying ammo) they also have talent trees, the best way i can describe it is that rather than picking a specialization when you hit 10, you get access to three talent trees with minor upgrades that add up and some bigger spells further down the tree. you can put points in multiple trees at the same time and aren't confined to just one spec, and you get one point per level.
---
tldr pretty much everything is different, the overall pace of the game is much more slow and relaxed and more heavily focused on the rpg elements. the game is significantly more difficult compared to modern, but not really that different in terms of gaming as a whole, just requires a bit of thought. it's pretty fun and i hope that you enjoy it!
---
No problem mate, I am happy that I could save your time.

Doesn't really matter if he gets through Naxx himself or not. After Naxx has been around a while servers will begin dying as the top guilds migrate to new servers or retire, either you go with them or you are left in a ghost town. Either way Classic will be something new, how it lives or dies is anybody's guess at this point. Your drinking game is a good way to kill yourself though...
---
When was this?
---
Leveling an alt and having your main parked in the same zone. Clapping anyone who instigates. That's that good shit. 
---
if you actually read the post i made, you would see me address this as not counting it due to the 3% hit gain being tied to achieving within 10 weapon skill of a boss, which is already done by combat rogue talents, so you will not get this bonus from human weapon skill so it shouldn't be attached to it.
---
still gonna play my human pvp rogue. what u gonna do?
---
Vanilla butchered lore just as much as the later expansions did.
---
I'm gonna main a shaman for PVE stuff and a rogue for PVP and to get bloody revenge when someone fucks with the shaman. One an orc and the other a troll. I'm still dithering one which will be which. My current thinking is: orc rogue for jumbo sized ambushes (provided Blood Rage doesn't ruin stealth), looking good in leather, and cool stealth animation. Troll for shaman because they look cool as hell with 2handers and berserking might help there a bit.
---
Ritual = Russian roulette. I‚Äôll pass!
---
In W3C at the ending you were presented to a world-ending event where all the relevant mortal races and their kingdoms participated, thanks to the guidance of Medivh. Having another few giant continents without any mention and any explanation, why the people from there didn't help is a plot hole.
---
You don't need to start all stories together at once. But you need to have consistency in your rules when you start a story. One of the rules is the setting of the game, the existing civilisations. Now you don't have to show every civilisation, you can have a few shown as mysterious and foreign, but then you have to explain the reason why they aren't fighting a big battle that everyone should fight. Or don't create such situation.
---
Good example for this would be the War of the Ring in Lord of the Rings: Every civilisation was present there, or was explained why they didn't make it. So once that war is over, you can focus on those other civs if you like, but the introduction of those do not feel like asspulls.
---
Depends on what you consider the starting zone.
---
suggest a better race for tank then? 
---
Sweet i was worried it might be almost useless =)
---
As someone who leveled through STV as a level 30-40 hunter, I can confirm.
---
Orc is the best tank on Horde side, Human is the best tank of the Alliance.
---
I can go into details if you wish.
---
You're forgetting LWing Saltshaker. There are 3 total cooldowns. 
---
I think I'd do it this way:
---
For the moment only plan on lvling 2 characters to 60. I want my main to have Engineering and neither of my 2 60 chars are casters, so they don't need Tailoring.
---
You can distribute the remaining 3 professions slots with all the gathering preffoessions, this gives you access to all mats in the game, even high lvl ones cause you're at 60. 
---
After this I'd lvl 3 characters to 35 and assign Alchemy, BS, Ench, LW, Tailoring how I see fitting. Keep lvling if I want to. 
---
Whenever I want to make a new character, I have 5 more slots for characters I'd lvl without professions until 35 where id assign 2 of these: LW, Alchemy and Tailoring, so that i can make use of the cds. 
---
Ironman has ramped up difficulty in BFA significantly with how old world scaling now works. 
---
For context on how difficult it is to do the ironman challenge now, there are only two 120s who completed the ironman challenge since BFA release.
---
Or 13
---
I really enjoyed rolling as a mage in vanilla &amp; bc for both raiding and later in PVP. I returned to the game at the lvl 85 or 90 cap and fell in love with running arena's as a resto sham with a warrior, but found lfr painfully boring. 
---
Will I find raiding as a resto sham boring in classic compared to my days as a mage? I like the idea of resto sham for pvp, but am afraid I'll get bored raiding/farming quickly as a healer.
---
I want to dedicate a lot of time to end game content, but also want to smash face in pvp.  
---
First a comment about doing the mail-bag extension. I can safely say this is more harmful than a benefit in the long run. I have done it multiple times and EVERY time it will result in loosing a LOT of materials when you dont know if its first sent or you have still the returned 30d on it. Its easy to manage first, but after lets say couple months to a year you are totally lost what was sent and when.
---
So sure, use it at launch when you dont have bag space, but after you have a L60, CLEAR OUT every chars mailbox. Even vendoring stuff will result in better result than loosing them completely. 
---
2nd thing, MANAGE YOUR BANK. I regularly notice that i have shit on my mains bank thats literally worthless, while hungry for bag space. So while things like wool cloth is nice to have in bank for example your tailoring alt, fast forward 3 months and unless you want to use 500g+ on bags + bank slots, you have to cut your losses. Same thing on quest items that you either discarded the quest or completed it and the item stays in inventory. Throw that shit out.
---
3rd part, figure out what you want to do with each profession. If you want to just have alchemy for transmutes, you might as well leave the alt at L35 (until you have time to level it up further). If you want to make like mana potions for main, you need to get it to \~max level. I would suggest on main healers to have herbalism+enchanting (unless you want tailoring for BoP epix or engineering for pvp), because of DME duo runs with a warrior that has mining and those will result in some kind of gold even running around, even if you dont actually actively MAKE enchants. And on main dps classes what ever you want + engineering. On warrior/other tanking class i would take mining.
---
What im thinking about actually, is starting out at fresssh with skinning+leatherworking even if i dont plan on using either of those (on that char). Loads of mobs, super easy levelup, you could do first month transmutes (every healer wants that back) and then go whatever you want (with a mount). Engineering is relatively cheap to levelup what ever you do, so if thats your 2nd prof just use AH to complete it.
---
Tbh, thats still up in the air, i want to see what the server population and respawn system is going to be like first.
---

This worked for me in a macro during BC/Wrath.

---
I havent played druid since then, really. I would reckon macros will follow 7.3.5 logic - considering what we know now.
---
orc racials are useless for tank
---
No, they absolutely are not. Weapon skill is one of the most coveted stats for melee classes in classic WoW because of its effect on glancing blows.
---
tell me what axes do u plan to tank with?
---
My stupid ass thought it was a scorpion at first, his name did not suggest a human. Needless to say, the search went on for quite a while.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?items=2.0#0-2+1
---
none of those are threat weapons, there are much better options for highest tps, and if you are going for defensive options, there again are better options
---
Elaborate please. What is the qualifying attribute a weapon possesses that makes it well suited as a tanking weapon?
---
weapon speed? I don't think u know much about tanking.  Orc isn't bad if you want to pvp, but if were talking about min/max tauren warrior is the best tank
---
Weapon speed has no bearing on your ability to generate threat or rage. This is a very old myth which I'm glad to say has been mathematically disproved a long time ago.
---
The only tanking ability a Warrior has which is reliant on attack speed is Heroic Strike, which is an ability you would only use to dump rage in scenarios where you are rage capped which should not happen.
---
I wouldn't be so hasty in proclaiming anybody's supposed lack of knowledge if I were you.
---
Yes indeed, and preferably with a nightfall axe or annihilator.
---
Honestly I'm not sure. I raided as horde in vanilla and I've raided mostly as horde on private servers aswell. I believe its available to both factions.
---
The truth hurts, I know.

*Wooo* It's your **1st Cakeday** SalutationsGaming! ^(hug)
---
PvE server chads are laughing at you.
---
Why? You're mad because I didn't say BfA or what? Have you even thought about that there's maybe something true about that Wotlk was so good, when so many people liked it? Calling it circlejerk, holy shit. You know what? I'd say you didn't even play it and you probably started playing in Legion, or even BfA.
---
Now go back to that shitty sub you mentioned where bunch of fanboys are making fun of people who criticize anything about the current WoW meanwhile being so brave in their safe space. It's actually funny to see how that sub is inactive.
---
How would a random dude be able to ninja an item from a first AQ raid kill?
---
Damn it, Blizz, give us chainmail tunics.
---
It's absolutely not a must have. Want to PvP? Just flag for it.
---
People will try and coerce you into playing on them so they can have more people to gank. They seem to be very afraid that without that rabid pressure others might decide for themselves...
---
(Obviously, there is nothing wrong with PvP in itself. What is funny in a sad way is the cult like hustling for PvP servers. :)
---
would be at least better than always having loot trading without a choice.
---
I'm seeing their potential as a FC in WSG stay solid at the very least.
---
At max level it really shines. Raiding become very tense because you want to get your world buffed guild into the raid without another guild stripping them of their buffs, for example. Yojamba Isle and BRM can turn into a hotbed of wpvp at raiding hours!
---
Alex is a god! Love u bro
---
More a less
---
I still don't think it will be the majority though. Classic will get a ton of tourists, sure, but some of them are bound to stick around playing whatever janky class/race combo that they picked on launch day. Hell, not to mention the casuals that intend on playing and don't really care on race aside from aesthetics.
---
The number of optimal "combos" will be higher than actual Vanilla, I'm sure though.
---
Resto Sham is one of the Highest skill cap healers in game,  do research and check for totem-twisting while maintaining high HPS in all my servers only saw 4-5 people total pulling that off well, could probably name them all also. 
---
For PvP  you mostly wanna do Ele, as priests are healers of vanilla PvP
---
No word yet but I'd be willing to bet money that there will be (the infrastructure is already there with modern WoW OCE servers).
---
&gt;Lol you can‚Äôt release a game without bug testing.
---
Why not? Blizzard did with BFA ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

WoD, was nerfed in Legion or BFA.
---
At one point, it was so strong that, quite literally, every single character in the top ~100 or so in the 3v3 bracket was a human (aside from classes that couldn't be humans of course.)
---
Why would you willingly submit yourself to running across the entire continent to get to a dungeon? 
---
Why would you willingly submit yourself to scrimping, saving and scraping every copper piece to afford new spell ranks and maybe, just maybe, afford a mount at level 40?
---
Why would you willingly submit yourself to spending arduous hours questing and grinding to reach max level?
---
Why would you willingly submit yourself to spending your weekend with 40 people you don't know and some guy named Buff telling you what to do, when all you get, if you're extremely lucky, is a single piece of loot? 
---
Because you could just as easily *not* play on a Classic server. 
---
Would be interesting to see tipsout getting like 8/25 points
---
So we pay blizz a sub fee to celebrate the sacking of 800jobs?
---
Many thanks!
---
I'd just charge a rune of portals and a tip personally, but there's merit in having a set price too. Anything up to like 1g is arguably okay, beyond that you're kinda taking the piss.
---
Dire maul, zg island, gates of aq
---
Yeah for pvp alliance will be both the best amd worst, while horde will be in the middle, as a vague rule of thumb. Being on an alliance premade is magic.
---
everyones down voting u but its true, if u dont maintain ur looks why would someone want to spend a night with u if theyre no longer attracted to u? also assuming were talkin about "spending a night with the wife" if u catch my drift, sexual stuff. sex stuff. havin sex. puttin ya cock in her pussy. maybe ass too if ur lucky.

There cannot exist truth about whether vanilla is made for world pvp. Raiding only for the sake of raiding is not really appealing to a lot of people hence there is no real game without world pvp. Btw this changes in TBC because skill based fulfilling pvp is accessible to pve servers.
---
Why would anyone pick a fight they know they'd lose? That's idiotic. And I guess you forgot that it doesn't matter in PvP server.

They will not have permanent sharding. Most anti Classic idea ever added to game. And they will not have cash shop - Vanilla community would buy so few and so many would leave. 
---
I am certain right click report will be in game and loot trading but hope sustained beta feedback can kill them
---
the zone you start in
---
Yeah I thought the same. Great quiz tho! I really enjoyed it
---
My ideal server would probably be something like this:
---
PvP server (not opposed to RP-PvP, but many of my irl friends have no intention of rolling on PvP servers)
---
Original server cap (maybe 500-1k people over the original server cap)
---
Pretty much even split between Horde/Alliance. Would be fine if it was 45/55 either way.
---
A server full of fun people. I want all those creative people over at my server. The people that does lvl 1 raids to Orgrimmar to zergrush people who lost duels, the people that kite world bosses to other places to create havoc. The people that summon Doomguards to Goldshire and watch the world burn. Oh, and active World PvPers. 
---
Don't have any problems personally with MC falling in the first week. It might be a little cheesy, but if the bleeding edge min/maxers want to go for it, then i want them to have fun. Them clearing MC quickly won't impede on my leveling or joy with the game, so if that brings them a lot of joy i am happy for them.
---
Finally i want a limited amount of elitist dicks. I like people who are knowledgeable and good at the game, but don't care for people who are rude and use their years of experience and years of theorycrafting vanilla to lord over the scrublets. Most people are receptive to learn as long as you aren't a total dick about it. 
---
And maybe a tiny bit of server drama to top it off. A war for Devilsaurs, Black Lotuses and that one dumbass ninja looter getting blacklisted by everyone.
---
AFAIK most fear spells are not classified as magic. Pretty much the only fear effects I know of that are magic are Warlock spells: Fear, Howl of Terror and Death Coil.
---
Howl of Terror and Death Coil were later buffed to unclassified debuffs in TBC, and Howl of Terror was also classified as a Terror effect so that Howl of Terror and Fear no longer DR'd with each other.
---
To the best of my knowledge every other fear effect is unclassified and can only be removed via abilities that specifically break fear such as Divine Shield, Tremor Totem, trinkets and Will of the Forsaken.
---
P sure this is just the "alliance kiddies" meme peddled by every edgy 13 year old horde player
---
IIRC in one of the vanilla world first boss kills there's a Hunter filming the fight and he had like 2k gold, a full set of 18 slot bags, but he was using cheap vendor ammo for the world first boss kill.
---
The mentality was just different back then. Everybody basically went out of their way to spend as little gold as possible on raiding because we hadn't really understood yet that consumables were a mandatory part of raiding meant as a sort of 'raiding tax' on players.
---
Oh hai r/runescape
---
#NoChanges and patchcycle 1.1 to 1.12 minus all bugs.
---
Only if you would otherwise be grinding or whatever. If you're in town for AH or just relaxing and shooting the shit with guildies then it's obviously an upgrade
---
I plan on doing tailor / enchant and then dropping tailoring for engineering when i focus on pvp
---
People are good enough at the game nowadays, that even the below average leveler will never die while leveling on a PvE server. Overpulled? Hamstring, feign death, frost nova, gouge + kidney etc.
---
and run away. 
---
Leveling on a PvE server feels like playing retail. You never die and the only time sink is that you need to eat/drink more than in retail WoW. 
---
There is no risk anymore and thats not fun for most.
---
Yes only because they are strong at max in general, but assuming everything is equal (gear, player skill, professions, luck) you won't be winning many fair fights solo.
---
what 7 mounts drop in dungeons/raids?
---
ZG (2)
---
Strat UD
---
then there's the 4 Qiraj Resonatinc Crystals, but they're only available inside AQ40? not really much of a mount?
---
It's the little things, like buffing up every player I meet. On a pve server that buff is meaningless. Sure the friendly will be able to kill mobs a tiny bit quicker but it wont prevent a wipe. In a PvP server that friendly might take notice and help you out when a rouge jumps on you. Or he might survive a warrior's swing just enough so you can heal him up.
---
On a PvP server I try to level on a slightly lower level zone to make sure I'm able to defend myself. That takes planning and patience.
---
Yesterday a hunter friend asked me to help him out kill the Nesingwary big elite white tiger. We actually had to coordinate A LOT because of the enemy players. This would've normally been just a simple get there - wait for spawn - kill mob kind of situation. But here we had to sneak around, scout ahead, try to get another guy to help.
---
And guess what, while waiting to respawn I routinely helped killing already tagged mobs. One of the friendly noticed this and when the boss spawned he joined us and fend off a horde player on his own.

What the hell is up with that BFA map?
---
Some day, the factions will be more or less gone in the progression game and Classic will be the only one with proper factions. It's the next RPG feature to get the axe ^^^even ^^^if ^^^it's ^^^probably ^^^for ^^^the ^^^best ^^^at ^^^the ^^^point. ^^^At ^^^least ^^^as ^^^an ^^^RPer.
---
Threat&gt;survivability if durable enough to be healed. So +skill trumps the 5% health u get being tauren. 
---
Every class that can keep you on distance will be a pain in the ass.
---
To max the chance of winning a fight you totally need to know your cooldowns, how to stance dance in the right situations, you need to keep track of your rage and you literally need to play with the map (blocking LoS for example).
---
Furthermore engineering is really good for extra damage and utility. Also Free Action Potions are Superior! Max your weapon skills, the range weapons as well. A lucky crit can save your life.
---
Mages with a little skill eat you like breakfast btw. It takes a lot of knowledge to win 1v1 against mages.
---
Most rogues are pretty bad at playing their class, even on private servers at least half of the rogues I got attacked by killed themselves after I've used retalation. Good rogues can outperform you tough.
---
You are trashing PvPers and their servers just like allegedly they trash you, because you cant consider that there a different strokes for different folks. 
---
People *enjoy* worldPvP. I *enjoyed* being ganked by a level 60 and then drumming up 5 level 35s and we took a dump on the 60. He was even PvP geared with engi items and we still took im down.
---
It made another STV panther/tiger/raptor grind into a memorable experience that I still think fondly off. 
---
The additional reward of PvP server is the PvP itself. The PvP is *fun.*
---
Physical damage dealers had a chance against higher level players, they don't miss that often.
---
You can forget about magic though, it's just resist-resist-resit. One of my biggest issues with vanilla to be honest.
---
1% hit = 1/100 of your frostbolt damage
---
1% crit is the same.
---
Thanks for all the advice ill keep them in mind
---
I remember back in 2006 I'd just got off the Zepelin at Undercity and I seen a red ?? player... My mate warned me not to go near him as he couldn't attack me due to to it being a friendly zone for us. 
---
Instead I said I'll just got and sap him to annoy him, so I did just that.. 10 seconds later I'm stood there /laughing at him only to have him destroy me in a split second. I was adamant that sapping was not a hostile action, but I guess it was!! 
---
Ahh good memories..
---
Obviously I can consider that pvp has a big following, hence the op. 
---
no streamers and no non-americans 
---
A place where i can do 40v40 with 60 fps
---
Collect 4 Zebra Hooves that takes about 4 days played 
---
My perfect classic wow server would look like Avril Lavigne sk8terboi era so I could play wow and have sex with her at the same time. 
---
Money will be tight and there'll be a ton of other players if you start at the same time as everyone else. Makes money tighter because being new you won't be at the front of the pack, (those guys get rich!) but learning to play quite a bit easier because there's always gonna be help nearby.
---
If you're being a CC class just know that some are trickier to use than others. Warlocks can cause big trouble, hunters need to be skilled, mages have it easy, and the others don't work on most targets.
---
Maybe plan to be on discord with your friends so they can help you easier.
---
If you're getting too much advice all at once don't sweat it, it's slow to progress so you'll have lost of time to learn the game. Have fun!
---
Yes, but youre constantly trying to belittle or tell people how dumb PvP is in a game in which PvP is a huge part. 
---
Would you tell people that Warcraft3 PvP is dumb, because you can take on red creep spots for them sweet items?

&lt;DOMINATUS&gt; [OCEANIC] [HORDE] [PVP]
---
Time Zone: GMT+11
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+11 (days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP (Details TBA)
---
Contact: https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX
---
Guild info: Dominatus will be a late-night, semi-hardcore guild with a no-dickhead policy. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+11 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).
---
   
---
Join the discord here https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX and feel free to message if you have any questions.
---
Cheers!
---
Weapon speed is nice. But it's not the end of the world unless for Vael (Alcor's + unlimited rage=insane HStrike spam). But + skill is as well. And the boosts it gives is higher. 
---
Tauren only brings effective health boost (5% total health + NR boost), no boost in threat. Orc brings more threat but no survivability boost. 
---
So the difference lies in how to itemize: **+wskill is way harder to itemize than survivability.** So a tauren would need to get the likes of edgemasters/anubisath/maladath/hungering cold(heh) to get close. Of all of this only edgemasters are obtainable early and not only they are expensive as hell, but lack any other stat as well, so you're losing more stats which likely overweigh the minimal health boost. 
---
&gt; Good rogues can outperform you tough. 
---
As long as they don't get decimated by Overpower crits, sure.
---
I mean pvp was not a huge part of the game when I played actual vanilla because I played on a pve server.  I remember having fun in warsong gulch when it first came out. I played it a lot that weekend but that was kind of it. 
---
It's still adds up to a lot out of your pocket for no compensation
---
No, but once they start the cast you can come out and get a free fireball against them while they are casting. Bonus points for blinking through them too.
---
&gt;To die a lot
---
and then to die some more.... even in the starter zones you will not be safe.
---
Collect 4 hooves with a drop change of 10%.... massacre!
---
Faithful druid here: there are a ton of class-specific lists.  Three lists are pretty easy to obtain on Google searches.  Since I know the druid one, I can say it includes crafted items.  Honestly, the list of crafted items on my list near pre-raid BiS is so limited that I never considered pursuing a craft.  For healers, the most obvious is hide of the wild.  Flamecore wraps are high on the pre-raid BiS, but bracers of prosperity are extremely close and drop often of tribute runs. Corehound belt is exceptional, but is also BoE. So in short, the two best items can be made by others and the other items have near equivalent works drops
---
I played on a PvP server and the PvP was relentless and most of the time a lot of fun.   
---
The problem with PvE servers for me personally is that there are only 3 BGs and thats all the PvP you will experience in 95% of the cases.
---
On a PvP server on a sunday evening you normally had 10-15 "BGs" running all over the world. 
---
GromGol was assaulted without fail by 20-80men raids. I clearly remember shamans sitting on the guard towers shooting chain lightnings into the alliance sieging the gate. 
---
World bosses I only encountered on pserver but often it was a 5hour slugfest until one side could claim victory. 
---
BGs feel more like a minigame once you encounter and embrace the PvP that happens in the world from 1v1 , 2vX skirmishes to 600 people fighting over a boss.
---
MotW buff :)
---
An calander addon for raiding with your guild, signups and all that
---
In warrior solo PvP I highly recommend engineering.  The goblin rocket helmet, in particular, can get you close enough to fuck up classes who like to kite. Also, free action pots. 
---
So it is clear PVP servers are not for you. Your goals in the game are vastly different than most people in this thread. You enjoy gathering mats for a quest or profession without interuption of pvp. For others the possibility a rogue is sneaking up on you or a hunter trying to get the drop is a very exciting thought and keeps the game fun. As others have said you will lose some of the ganks and you will win some, you will definetly remember the wins very fondly (atleast I do).
---
It can get annoying if there is no other person around to help you out. But thats when you log off and play your alt for a bit and continue later. But you will probably see this point as interupting your desired gameplay, where others dont mind this so much. Roll on a pve server, enjoy the game you like and dont be so insecure and say people shit on pve servers. Pvp servers for me are the only way to go, running around in a hostile zone being on edge makes the game so much more fun, couldnt imagine not having that.
---
 
---
&lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it.
---
We have players with experience in vanilla ranging from none at all to a full clear of Naxx. We are also accepting unoptimal or non-orthodox specs although we hope that these players put in the extra time required to perform well at the level of other, more optimal, specs. 
---
 We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week in a semi-hardcore environment. Players who want to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared.  Raid dates: TBD
---
# Talk to us on Discord!  [https://discord.gg/2C6gJZw](https://discord.gg/2C6gJZw)
---
Nah mate private servers might has some mobs that has 50 armor less so they aren't accurate to actual vanilla wow, and it will ruin any expectation of how ACTUAL classic is gonna be.
---
Auto dismount addon knocks out of form I think. 
---
Thanks mini
---
Ahh yeah, good feeling
---
every class but druids disabled
---
&gt;save your gold for other things like food/water
---
Better still, there is no Nomi so you can just learn the cooking &amp; fishing skill and profit from that. Selling the mats from Fishing can be worthwhile as well.
---
Haha take it easy mate
---
It‚Äôs not great. Even a R14 Warrior will struggle against a fresh 60 Mage. It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing because other R14 classes easily own any fresh 60.  It‚Äôs a big reason why Warriors don‚Äôt like going out in the world alone because 1v1 is such a hassle for them. 
---
Triathlon i'd say... exept you wont be able to cycle as it will be all walking/swimming until late 40s (for most).
---
&gt;blues come from dungeons
---
And also, there is no personal loot. Huntards get to roll &lt;need&gt; for anything.
---
No streamers Server
---
But they REGENERATE HEALTH
---
You get the added choice of beef on top of bear and cat steaks
---
Quite subjective. PvP racial suits shadowmeld as well, but it requires more preparation for combat, usually only worth it in open world PvP, unlike the in-combat utility of stoneform. That said, it is quite more versatile. Ambushing, hiding, outplaying versus a straight cleanse+inmunity for a while. 
---
Looks are just personal choice. 
---
So much bad happening to wow and activision keep putting store mounts in the shop annd here people are subbing to play project 60.
---
Ya, druids would be nigh unkillable, but also couldnt really kill much themselves when fighting against other 'all talent specced' classes.
---
&gt; looks more like overcrowded pserver gameplay 
---
4 human players on screen *at most* in this vid. Yep, must be overcrowded private server things! Not representative *at all*!
---
That insane number of people will *never* congregate so closely in Classic, yep. Definitely not for the most lucrative herb in the game. 
---
On private servers the most toxic hours are NA hours.
---
Pvp server
---
5000-6000 cap
---
Blizzlike progression. The hardcore guilds will stomp through the raids anyway. Buffing the raids will only slow down the casual guilds which is pointless. 
---
with a bunch of consumables (free action potions), engineering tools and top gear. 
---
basically if you are 1%pop tryhard.
---
if you are a basic bitch warrior, you won't be able to do much against most classes, if they aren't noobs or notably undergeared.
---
watch some monkeynews wpvp videos.
---
Started midway Wotlk I believe, i thought the racial was called every man for himself. 
---
&gt; I don't see how any class with just 51 talent points could beat a Warlock with 164 talent points. They'd be like a dungeon boss relative to everybody else
---
You have to compare with the same amount of talent points.
---
Every private server is 90% european and the entire private server scene is a total shithole. 
---
Will of the Forsaken is definetly better for PVP.
---
Hunters vs warriors are entirely about who gets the jump on the other. If you can charge in and get a hamstring off then you'll win 9 times out of 10, and if not you're in for a rough time.
---
Right? It's almost like it's the only choice for Horde when rolling Druid.
---
I don't really get what you're trying to achieve with this thread. You're asking the community why they enjoy PvP servers and what their motivations are for playing in a PvP environment, but at the same time you're trying to come up with counter arguments for everything as if you were trying to convince yourself. 
---
If you don't want to take part in any PvP because you're afraid of confrontations just stick to PvE servers and pick flowers in a peaceful environment, nobody cares and you'll probably end up playing with like-minded people so it's all good. It's quite obvious PvP servers are not for you.
---
They are mounts and they drop.
---
Why is the quiz on YouTube. Urgh.
---
But say your friends are alliance and the server limits you from joining because there's a fraction imbalance. That would suck. 
---
Okay, I'll bite.  Why no paladin?
---
&gt; Night Elves... get a participation trophy.
---
Hunter shadowmeld base defense is pretty good. And shadowmeld -&gt; mind control into lava isn't too bad either.
---
I can only speak for myself but I believe it's too early to even think about something like this right now.
---
The game is not even out yet and recent events made me question severely Blizzard's ability to make good decisions.
---
I'm not even sure they will make Classic right, let alone change it.
---
If it turns out I'm totally wrong about them (I hope honestly) then I can talk about the future, now is not that moment though.
---
GARROTE
---
Big streamers will always play pve realms.
---
That is a very good point. I really hope they deliver what they have promised.
---
Currently downvoted, but right. 
---
uhm, no
---
Eh, it's just 9 agility + whatever modifier percentage you get on top of that. Not a huge difference IMO. Lots of people favour stoneform over shadowmeld, so that's a consideration unless you want to literally just raid log.
---
Best hint, works thanks!
---
Hi people I‚Äôd like to find a guild to join for classic. 
---
EU
---
Preferably PVP server
---
Horde or alliance, I don‚Äôt mind
---
I can commit 2 week nights to raiding (GMT)
---
Im looking for a friendly and mature group of players to experience classic wow with. My main focus is PVE content, running dungeons and eventually raids, looking forward to making friends and working together to help each other get geared. I will definitely join for bgs and w/pvp too. I‚Äôve got experience with wow over various expansions throughout the years and have a decent knowledge of multiple classes, I‚Äôll be playing hunter though which has been the class I‚Äôve enjoyed the most. 
---
Please PM me or if you could send me discord links that would be great. Thank you
---
Orc stun resist is strong as fuck though.
---
What did I say wrong? I'm just tired from fanboys on r/wow and here calling absolutely everything circlejerk. I said Wotlk is my favourite expansion, that means I'm circlejerking?
---
I'll hold onto the dream thanks.
---
For the simple reason that we both want to win. (Blizzard and classic fans) 
---
If Classic is done right it'll be the best money grab it could ever be. It's a new game level of income on an older falling game without anywhere near the dev cost/time. It's easy money for Acti-Blizz, and the better it is the more it will make.
---
They will no doubt also be "Happily surprised" at having wows numbers back up for the next investor call.
---
I think they were trying to emulate Warhammer Online in making ‚Äúunique‚Äù mechanics for classes.
---
Enemies can kill you.
---
WotF fucks with warlocks and warriors. Hardiness fucks with warriors, paladins, rogues, shadow priests, druids and occasionally hunters. It's true that WotF is more reliable though.
---
If they add things into it, I hope it's just cosmetic options (emphasis on options). Like the possibility to choose retail models and animations for example. Or seasons where you can prestige your character and do the game all over again. No change in gameplay or more raids with additional gears and loots. 
---
That said, I'm ok with no change at all. And right now it's preferable, as we can't fully trust Actiblizz.
---
There was one patch during vanilla where, for about 1 day warriors had an extra talent point- 31/21 arms warriors running around death wish mortal striking people. It was everything I dreamed it could be.
---
The server will be 5k capped and PvP. 
---
The game will be patch progressive like on private servers, but not only items, talents and spells will also follow the emulated patches. Same will work with the resistance changes, I expect a Curse of Shadow to give bonus damage from the negative resistance. 
---
The release schedule will be something like this:   
---
July 2019: server release
---
November 2019: Patch 1.2 (Maraudon)
---
January 2020: Patch 1.3 (Dire Maul)
---
March 2020: Patch 1.5 (Battlegrounds)
---
July 2020: Patch 1.6 (BWL)
---
August 2020: Patch 1.7 (ZG)
---
October 2020: Patch 1.8 (world dragons)
---
February 2021: Patch 1.9 (AQ)
---
May 2021: Patch 1.10 (T0.5)
---
July 2021: Patch 1.11 (Naxxramas)
---
September 2021: Patch 1.12 (World PvP Objectives)
---
After that I would like to see a transition to TBC where we can copy our characters over so we have the choice to stay on vanilla or go for TBC. 
---
The 2.0 pre-expansion patch should hit about July 2022, marking the three year anniversary. 
---
The reasoning behind this patch progression is to keep the game in 1.0-1.8 as long as possible because honestly after that Vanilla becomes extremely raid focused because PvP becomes retardedly imbalanced and just outright boring with everyone one-shotting eachother. 
---
Lastly I don't actually want to know the schedule, I want it to be a surprise. Like if Blizzard posts that the next week will have a new patch. 
---
They needed TBC S2 gear to get that really ganky look going strong. [https://imgur.com/a/UYNlrmM](https://imgur.com/a/UYNlrmM)
---
I used to collect rogue artwork, the Forsaken section was really the best :) [https://www.pinterest.co.uk/Lastroguepvp/forsaken-rogues/](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/Lastroguepvp/forsaken-rogues/)
---
I think adopt the OSRS approach. Jagex revived the game as it was in '07 and after a couple of years of building up rapport and trust with the playerbase, started to poll potential changes to the game (both balance changes and content). Fast forward to 2019 and Jagex have seperate dev teams and both games are treated like their own standalone releases. It's not perfect and like with any MMO it's impossible to please everybody but I think Jagex found a perfect balance to restore a truly great game to its former glory and proved that it wasn't "just nostalgia". :)
---
Haha, you should not have gkicked, but rather gquit with the chosen players and form a new guild using excuses like 'we're trying to raid more hardcore'. 
---
It's what happens so many times without causing too much drama. Especially on new servers. All the 60s from various guilds leaving to form their own guild because they dont want to wait for guildmembers to catch up.
---
It didn't affect classic at all though. Also, the restructuring program will allocate a 20% increased budget on all game franchises. Say what you want, but no devs got fired and they now have a 20% increased budget to make the games better.
---
Maybe I wouldnt even feel so much backstabbed (it happens...it's an online world with peeps you dont know) as much as realizing you apparently was 'one of the worse players' where you probably thought you were considered one of the better ;-)
---
This seems really interesting. I didn't know that was how they handled it.
---
The "industrial revolution" comp.
---
Because people just have no patience. The top MT leaves and next day half the guild left instead of just waiting a few weeks to gear a new MT.
---
I agree with the trust issue. Just based on the interaction, or lack thereof, with the Classic community it seems uncertain whether or not we will even get what we have been asking for.
---
Based from what devs have said it is going to be as close to vanilla as possible. Which means no lfr, no mounts till 40 etc etc etc. Only thing that might be different from obvious things is possible sharding and right click reporting. 
---
DYOR.
---
Blizzcon 2018.
---
&gt; For one, most of the people who were playing the game back then no longer do so. 
---
I'm sure Blizzard see Classic as a way of pulling in new customers rather than appealing to people with current subscriptions. For each player active right now there are many, many more who used to love the game but drifted away over the years. 
---
I'm sure some kids who've only played recent expansions will be distraught that they have to wait until 40 before buying a mount (if they can afford one) and actually have to try to level rather than faceroll a levelling experience that isn't much more than an interactive cut-scene for endgame content, but I really doubt they're not the target demographic.
---
 **&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance**
---
**Language**
---
English
---
**Guild Type**
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm firsts and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out, as long as you have a mindset that‚Äôs willing to learn. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay, and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay. 
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule (GMT+1)**
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
During new content release we expect to dayraid
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM‚Äôing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!
---
[https://discord.gg/vwhNZdj](https://discord.gg/vwhNZdj)
---
&gt; I feel like they only exist for high level players to kill significantly lower players while they quest.
---
So you have never met an enemy player of equal or slightly different level?
---
yes but they were comparing undead vs trolls. i still think undead rogues&gt;orc rogues because it allows them to stay on warlocks better. which are kind of a weakness for rogues. orcs will ofc help you verse warriors/other rogues but i think its best to work on your weaknesses
---
Mining has an incredibly annoying bridge you need to cross: From Tin to Iron. You will see thousands of iron nodes everywhere while still a couple of skillpoints short. It's pure aids.
---
If you're unlucky, the same may happen with the Mithril -&gt; Thorium bridge. I literally had to mine 60 mithril nodes for the one final skill-up. 
---
That's what makes a lot of things more rewarding. The harder it was to get your gear piece, the more value it has for you.
---
&gt;But unlike melee that use ranged weapons exclusively for the stats
---
No, melee used it to pull actually. Not that they needed a good one for that of course....
---
I normally leave Horde alone out in the world as long as they're not being aggressive, except for undead rogues. I bash the fuck out of every undead rogue I see. 
---
&gt; I pay to play this game unless another player chooses to ruin my fun.
---
Some people don't see fighting enemies as "ruining fun". It actually makes levelling more interesting and thrilling for both sides.
---
Also, world pvp brings a lot of good memories. I'd say for me personally about 80% of fun memories from vanilla experience are tied with various forms of world pvp.
---
That does sound kind of fun
---
They also added an account level requirement in order to use the in-game poll booths too to avoid vote manipulation. Again, not a bulletproof solution but I think everything will have some flaws. There is some bias with the current system, for example polling PvP nerfs are almost always going to be rejected by the PvP community and accepted by the skilling community, especially if the proposed nerf indirectly buffs skillers and vice versa. Jagex also don't hide poll results so votes can be affected by confirmation bias. Ironically, hiding poll results was polled and was rejected lmao. It's not a perfect system and does have flaws, but it seems to have worked for the most part.
---
Well democracy isn't perfect but I guess it's the best way for people to feel like they have been heard.
---
Most of this is off the table.
---
However, they will make every single possible change to vanilla if they see that it can cut their costs. Such as sharding, loot trading, automating things etc.
---
Not if you had not been able to afford the epic riding skill yet :) It would just be sitting in your bank waiting.
---
i always thought nightslayer looks awesome on trolls
---
Occasionally but it‚Äôs disproportionally represented
---
By your logic, we should all wake up and realise there is no point in living. Because almost everything you like in your life is just someone's money grab.
---
Same here. I hated the skill tree rework. 
---
I was figuring I was just wrong or doing it wrong but the responses from this thread have taught me that I wasn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll try to enjoy my time on pve servers and just deal with the fact that they will be empty because everyone (judging from this thread) will be on pvp
---
Why anyone would ever want to be a tauren over a night elf is beyond me, but I guess there's no accounting for taste
---
I mean.. they literally said that the goal is to make the experience as vanilla-like as possible and from what we have seen/heard so far it's going to be great. Loot trading is the only thing that will not be vanilla-like + sharding the first week or so.
---
That's easy I would get the biggest chunk of Iron I could get and use my new spell [Transmute: Iron to Gold](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11479/transmute-iron-to-gold) ;)
---
I have never killed a player or been killed by a player on Undocumented servers and felt I was enjoying my game experience. Killing a player is just a moment of safety that quickly fades and getting killed by a player is several minutes of frustration and anger
---
seems plausible.
---
Play an undead and then realise who you think you are, that's Vurtne
---
well, but isnt that the point ? They said! such-and-such, but how realistic is it that they are gonna hold on to that "promise", and even if they do, just for how! long ?
---
Portals don't sell very well. You'll get maybe one customer every 10 or so minutes, and that's being generous. At 1g a portal, that's 6g an hour, which even a level 30 could clear easily just by grinding. You're much better off grinding/aoe grinding, especially as a mage. 
---
Then again, I think you'll find more interesting things to do than to pile gold when you start playing.
---
hm...your word in the wow-gods ear;
---
Wait so you cant have High Warlord 2hand axe as human warrior????? 
---
&gt;Based from what devs have said it is going to be as close to vanilla as possible
---
but that is exactly the problem, isnt it ? "as possible" can be interpreted any number of ways, meaning it gives them whatever leeway they whish for to create their version of vanilla, rather than the actual, original thing. and I think that is exctly what is going to happen.
---
The sword you get from the New Ore Sample quest is actually worth a decent amount of silver. The quest itself is simple too as the mobs are spread all over 1k needles. You'll be able to kill kobolds while you do other quests in the area.
---
&gt;Blizzcon 2018
---
y right, bc pr events nowadays can actually be trusted as reliable sources of information
---
Pvp server 
---
3000-4000 server cap (not going to play on a pvp server if the cap is more than 5k, been there done that and it's a complete shitshow every time)
---
Slow PVE progression so I don't feel like I need to rush anything, I want to take my time leveling, getting my preraid BiS and then do Molten core for a few months
---
And finally, NO min/maxing no lifers =)
---
You're telling me.  As a paladin on a private server my hammer of justice gets resisted *a lot*.
---
I think they will, changing classic too much will make it an instant failure which means they have wasted 2.5 years of resources and time on nothing. We don't have to worry
---
Well if you don't believe what they say idk what to tell you. Because from what i gather no matter what they say you have hard time believing them.
---
Don't be too afraid of being turned away by raid groups. There will be much less people on official servers than on (popular)private servers. Guilds and raidleaders will have to work with much smaller pools of raiders and can't always afford to nitpick.
---
I hate the automated system as well and the entire idea of "offensive" speech, but if they are not interested in removing it, a sensible compromise would be to just reduce the punishment. 24 Hours is way too cruel and they can be way more flexible. They can do some or all of the following:
---
1. Start with 1 hour or even 15 minutes
---
2. Warn you when you have been reported and how many you still need (Information we don't know)
---
3. Only muted in the chat you were reported for
---
4. Unable report members of the opposing faction
---
5. I am not sure what the qualifications are for a GM, but they can perhaps just reduce the salary/lower the qualifications. I don't think you have to have a degree to just judge "offensive" behaviour. If they have more GM's they can go back to the previous method, where offensive behaviour was still reportable, but reviewed first
---
What i remember is that after the first zone i was not able to keep it on par with the leveling, so i had to go back and catch up on mining. This might be partly because there are not that many nodes, at least not as spread out as herbs so you might need to go away from your quests to mine in some cases in order to catch up. 
---
Make no mistake, this automation will not only stay but be even more present going into the future and classic is surely going to include automated systems for reporting and mutes and bans.  There is no hope for any kind of improvement in game master oversight or communication.  Many many times they've claimed they want to improve communication only to never do it and now with the lay offs we can see actiblizz doesn't give two shits about its employees nor its customers.
---
Unfortunately the AH is very limited with search options. We shouldn't have to search through several pages of auctions to find the stack with the correct amount we want. 
---
Just play on a private vanilla server  
---
Many are concerned about the abuse of left click report player automation and not the automation of the rest of customer support.
---
Strangle thorn Vietnam. Is it just me or are horde usually extra A**holish ?
---
PvP servers are really good for the strong. If you're no lifing it and you're ahead of 90% or more of the rest of the server, it means you have free reign over almost half the population. Someone trying to farm the same camp you are? Just kill them. No competition allowed.
---
I've noticed that I don't mind wpvp that much now that I'm playing on a fresh server and that I'm nolifing it, meaning that I have more gear and more levels than at least 90% of the server. But honestly, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you're playing with friends who absolutely insist on playing on a pvp server, if you plan on being middle of the pack/slightly behind, I'd recommend a pve server. 
---
If you plan on staying home and playing for 2 months straight without doing anything else, then sure, go ahead, play on a pvp server. It's probably going to help you more than it hinders you. 
---
A lot of people itt talk about how it makes the world "alive" and "dangerous", but I personally never experienced that. It's not like you can really play around ganks. Quests require you to go to specific areas/cities and if the opposite faction wants to gank you, there's very little you can do to avoid it. You can res and run the fuck off once it happens, but you can't really play around depleting your ressources while questing, you have to use your mana, your CDs, your healthbar, in plain sight of everyone who passes by. It doesn't feel dangerous, it just feels normal until someone decides to kill you and now you have to corpserun, not really that big of a deal. If there was bigger consequences to getting ganked, sure, it might give you a sense of impending doom whenever you play, but there aren't. Just a couple of minutes to corpserun. 
---
I think the biggest 'first filter' that new players encounter in WoW is the Agamand Mills quest chain for the Horde and the Murloc fins quest in Elwynn for the Alliance. If a new player gets past those quests without quitting, then he'll make it.
---
Cool leveling spec I did something similar before, and I stacked only +fire dmg items \[of fiery wrath\] and my fireballs would take 30%+ of the mobs HP lol good times. 
---
We only used free for all loot in all raiding, from ony to kt with no ninjas or drama, besides this.
---
His stock analysis "you can expect the stock to continue to drop throughout the week" is so awful. Jesus dude.
---
I am concerned about the population of servers over time, hopefully they will allow character transfers in case the server with your character turns into shit. That way atleast some servers will last forever
---
&gt;the Murloc fins quest
---
Ah yeah, those shitty little runners :)
---
good, if you can see them they aren't doing their job and need a lesson 
---
Sincerely, The Horde
---
Pretty much want the server that you want just more horde players since Im gonna be playing ally + an active rp community.
---
that is true; mostly bc the only thing they have said is that are going to make it as vanilla-like as possible, and have not gone into any measure of detail as to what the game is not! going to have/be like, which would be far more relevant.
---
at least will of the forsaken works against polymorph
---
just a heads up, insect swarm before 60 does like no damage. You would be way better off going for the feral talents after getting Furor. The extra crit and attackpower would be a big boost for leveling
---
hm...until the all the casuls start whining about how hard it is and how much they have to farm for just one piece of blue rarity gear...until it is wotlk icc all over again.
---
but, we will see, I guess.
---
Oh my god I forgot this
---
wtf is "x"? lol
---
SO hard to choose between Mage, Lock and Rogue. I think it also depends what gear levels we're talking about too. 
---
Who would this game appeal to if they added a bunch of the quality of life stuff that BfA has?  Retail players would just continue to play retail, and people who wanted classic would just continue on pservers.  I don't think Blizzard has much incentive to try to "improve" classic; it will more or less be a pretty faithful recreation of vanilla.
---
Most of the replies in this thread are based on 2005 meta and bad memory I think. 
---
The fact that people use free action potions and other consumables as a put down in itself is ridiculous. Warriors do just fine but have obvious flaws, the main problem is being kited. 
---
Even without consumables, low effort tactics like simply charging a frost mage to bait a blink without attacking will not leave you slowed and you can usually run out of combat for a reset. Most mages prioritize Blink &gt; Nova &gt; Ice block. Waste their blink and they are suddenly forced to either eat at least a white swing, ms and ww if not popping ice block, if they ice block, you still have intercept OR if you manage to get distance fast enough, you‚Äôll reset a third time. 
---
That scenario won‚Äôt happen all of the time, and it‚Äôs not meant as a fail safe. It just goes to show that the way people played this game for the most part is exploitable and you can make pretty much anything work if you put some time in to learn different match ups. 
---
FAPs and LIPs costs basically nothing and make up for most of your class flaws, use them
---
You also have the situation where some blues are better than epics of the same iLvl somehow. And that player power is at least 2x what it was back then. Aaaand you only have MC, BWL and the AQ raids since ZG and Ony were taken away.
---
The last time it was worth doing level 60 stuff was WotLK. After that it became pointless sadly.
---
well, lets hope they see it the same way as you do...
---
PvP  
---
5000 cap  
---
T0.5 available with BWL     
---
Cross Realm Battlegrounds in pools of 5-8 servers  
---
Naxxramas never gets released
---
I charge 50s. Most people give me 1g. I'll also accept the reagent from a lowbie.
---
I'm fine with that but only after like 2 years. Let's see how it all plays out first.
---
&gt;a R14 Warrior will struggle against a fresh 60 Mage.
---
lol no
---
Some funky wall jumped location near Dire Maul
---
Im not sure, it would be some wierd amalgamation of classic, tbc, and wotlk. With all the strengths but avoiding the potholes the game fell in.
---
Classes would be interesting and viable, but not homogeneous, content wouldn't become obsolete no flying mounts, keep faction identity so no horde pallies. Some Qol changes, area loot, better mailboxes but mostly minor stuff, limited catchup mechanics so that skipping raid tiers isn't very feasible after the content has been out awhile increase drop chances and add a few more total items dropped by boss. To make getting geared through older content not a total slog if you take a few months off or level an alt.
---
Do you even pserver brah?
---
this really doesn't need to be a video.
---
it will be portalninety though
---
Reminds me of nihilism.
---
0/10 would not recommend thinking and living this way.
---
Honestly this has more reason to be a Video than 80% of the 'classic influencers/content creators' Videos
---
At least it was enjoyable to watch .. unlike a 15 Minute Guide on ragefire chasm 
---
posting a thread title with the only content beeing a youtube link should be a bannable offense
---
We never had much drama.  We were a small guild and had gotten to know each other quite well.  However, as is the natural course, our GM wanted to grow the guild so we could actually start raiding.  In Vanilla we didn't have enough dedicated 60s to even do ZG without help (we had 10-12 dedicated players).  Come BC and we're recruiting players.  One day somebody logged in during the dead of night and looted all of the good stuff out of our bank and gquit.  After that it became very hard for our GM to trust any new recruits.  Previously he was pretty loose with the rules and who had access to what.
---
Only other drama I remember was when I "ninja looted" in Kharazan.  We had gotten our second full clear done and the tier 4 mage chest dropped off of Malchezzar.  The GM was a mage and so was I.  We had the settings to group loot because the raid was our ten closest and longest tenured guildies.  I saw the piece and rolled need.  As I did, our Vent chat started congratulating the GM on getting his T4.  Hearing this I start to panic and say "oh shit that was reserved for you?  Damn I rolled for it.  I really hope I don't win."  But of course, I out-rolled him and got it.  I apologized soooo many times but was met with total silence from the GM and everybody else in chat.  At that moment I wanted nothing more than to crawl into a hole somewhere and disappear.
---
I was so annoyed when it dropped during a BRD run on my Priest, after having failed to ever get it on my Rogue...
---
Go to Karazan raid, pull 200 mobs, put them in FOV - 30+ FPS - you are ok.
---
Also that Vega 11 GPU is somewhat comparable to Nvidia GT 1030 - which may show up in some benchmarks.
---
Not better than stun resist sir.
---
Classic and retail will share a subscription, it would make no sense to tailor classic to appeal to players who are already subscribed.
---
I mean, if I'm a warrior running Deadmines, and I have the choice between three healers: a Druid, a Paladin and a Priest, I'm obviously going for the Priest. Why would I intentionally pick one of the classes who also need Smite's Mighty Hammer?
---
Of course it is a money grab. They wouldn't dare to even make this game if it didn't net them some money. 
---
Classic will probably not overtake retail in terms of subs and active players, but it will bring a lot of players back who have either quit a long time ago or quit recently because they didn't like the newer xpacs. It's not outlandish to think that Classic will help retain some subs too, as it will give some people a reason to stay subbed for a month or two longer if they are burned out on retail. Not to mention the Classic players that find out they like retail, perhaps play both, perhaps spend some money on tokens, store mounts and/or buys the next xpac just to follow the lore and whatever.
---
Overall i think it will deliver a lot of fresh dollars in to Blizzard. So of course it is a money grab. It sucks that many people in Esports, King, QA, marketing and so on lost their jobs, but speaking strictly about Classic i don't think it will have any impact, really.
---
They have already commited to this project and have no doubt spent money on development and reverse engineering. They need it to succeed for it to be worth it, and for it to succeed they need to deliver what we want and what we were promised.
---
why not ? bfa is not classic, maybe they would want a vanilla world with bfa features. well not maybe, they surely do.
---
Except for Marshal Windsor on Alliance side.  Mandatory if you want to do Onyxia.
---
It also has a best pre-raid best in slot ring for healers as a reward.
---
**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
The panel at Blizzcon went into a lot of detail of how they are planning to go forward with it and why/how they are making decisions. 
---
If you have a problem trusting what they tell us, then i have no idea what to tell you. Just wait and see. But you hopelessly agonizing over "what if they aren't telling the truth" isn't really helpful. Summer isn't that far off.
---
Mages do not have infinite mana at low lvls so they often go oom using all their instant cast while trying to run from you. Shadow priests,BM hunters and SL warlocks with VoidWalker are strong and pretty much always win whenever they get the jump on you. 
---
Go arms and you will do alright on a pvp server while lvling. 
---
If you are talking end game dueling you need engineering and alot of trinkets to even be competetive.
---
At least the Horde can't gank you inside BRD
---
&gt; Project 60 on **Horde side** of Moon Guard NA
---
Horde Paladins do not exist in Classic.  This is an extremely basic thing, but now you know!
---
Any class with heals + a warrior is probably strong. Double mage. 
---
Healer + Tank if you wanna do lots of dungeons.
---
Pretty much. The games Industry is moving heavily towards automated things because it costs a LOT less and to them is 'good enough'.
---
If the OP won't play classic because of this then he/she isn't playing classic. I agree with the OP whole heartedly but the reality is what you said. This stuff isn't going anywhere.
---
Suck it up and start focusing more on the games and less on the companies OP. 
---
I feel you, but friends are friends in a guild, regardless of skill because... yeah its a videogame :D  
---
he didnt expect em to kick him takin advantage that he was out.  
---
  
---
And even tho he mayyybe realized he was "one of the worse players", he got horde first c'thun with the other guild lul  
---
But maybe he didnt care about "being one of the best or worse"
---
Thank goodness no.  If any part of that quest actually involved escorting him out in the world, the outcry would have been so bad that I'm sure Blizzard would have changed it to in-dungeon anyway.
---
Since you want to be an ass about yet, then yes.
---
This problem is easily fixed by hiring gm volunteers. Credible people that will follow the rules.
---
They won‚Äôt do that obviously because of reasons. I think they‚Äôll neglect classic and ruin it sooner or later but I really hope that they wake up and see what they do.
---
PvE.
---
2500 server cap.
---
All raids retuned so it's mathematically impossible to beat the end boss without gearing up on the earlier bosses.
---
A few choice spells and talents poached from TBC to make the failed PvE specs closer to viable in PvE. A bit more mana for elemental and moonkin, a bit more total raid damage for enhancement and ret (probably folded into their party buffs), a taunt and fixed talents for protadins, #nochanges to the current top dogs, except for warriors (see below).
---
Warriors nerfed to do less damage than pure DPS classes.
---
Tier 0.5 sets retuned to be BiS or close to it, and available at release.
---
Buff stacking cut back to TBC levels, world buffs not allowed in raids. Unlimited debuff slots.
---
Honour system replaced with TBC honour system, top PvP rewards tuned to be in line with current tier content.
---
An orc with a neckbeard named Nochangar hidden away in a corner of Orgrimmar that does the /cry emote every now and again.
---
No ninja looters, griefers, ADHD kiddies or anal spammers.
---
the real purpose of a 19 twink rogue is to keep him logged in redridge
---
its always funny when they pop evasion
---
Somalia has taxes.
---
What they should is just show the ballance on each server when you log into it so that you have a good idea on where to start as a group.
---
I'm still bummed that they chose to go with only 2 factions instead of some of the early concept of multiple factions.
---
Would've been awesome to have the complexity of multiple allied, neutral and enemy factions to your faction.
---
Yep, it's good. 
---
&gt;close to no taxes
---
Right, so we've established a completely unsurprising lack of reading skills, but that was assumed the moment you said "taxes are theft," which completely ignores THOUSANDS of years of reading material about the well-known concept of the social contract. Without the social contract, then the threat of violence becomes a lot worse than whatever amount of violence you think exists from not paying taxes.
---
But then there is clearly a thing if they want easier loot and whatnot then they can go play retail wow. 
---
Thread number 9.345.232 on this exact topic.
---
When another male undead skull lvl rogue kills you it feels just like you get another welfare epic from a quest in BfA. 
---
Bland and so much overused.
---
You are new to this but there are times when you are outdoors that a druids roots are the most OP form of CC.... I will give you an example. In your late 20s-mid 30s... there is a quest in Duskwood to kill this elite skeleton. He is nearly untankable he swings so fast with his 2 hand sword he wrecks people. However if you have a druid you can keep him rooted and everyone can just take him down with range attacks. There are other instances throughout the game where certain Melee NPC's are made easier by roots. 
---
This sort of holds true too in pvp but diminishing returns (using the same form of cc over and over has a lesser effect each time to the point of immune) . 
---
Play what you like however if you are leaning towards a dwarf priest you will be a hot commodity.
---
Without taxes, there is no government. Without government, there are no corporations. You are correct in this, since corporations are legal frankensteins created by the existence of numerous laws all intertwined.
---
As for me, I‚Äôm not convinced of any utopia. I do believe taxation is theft, and I believe government is a necessary evil. Sometimes, they are just a little more evil than necessary.
---
They haven't promised anything really, they've been very quiet.
---
Aparently reckoning doesn't trigger by sitting or so i heard. 
---
Like bringing your main and stomping the shit out of some no life gankers, this story brings warmth to my heart. Thank you for sharing. Legendary
---
It's a representative democracy. It is only as evil as the people allow it to be. Unfortunately, your average voter is either ignorant or indoctrinated and doesn't give a shit if we hurt our citizens or immigrants or foreign countries for exploitative reasons.
---
Much of their tax collection is done outside of any written rule set however. They ride up to people with guns and take their stuff. They are a little more obvious about the theft part, and the effective rate can be enormous for the victims.
---
You‚Äôre an idiot
---
I am looking for an Alliance EU guild on a PVP server.
---
I originally started playing half way through vanilla and didn't hit cap until TBC. I only stopped playing retail this year after falling out of love with BFA but raided and played PVP throughout the rest of the game (bar warlords where I quit for reasons)
---
I plan to play a Human Warrior and am happy to tank or dps.
---
If you are looking for a long time player for raising and PvP then pm me as I am looking for similar people to experience vanilla again with.
---
Not to mention so often every representative on the ballot is a pretty crappy option, and everyone has to vote for the lesser of two evils. You still get more evil, but you HAVE to vote for the lesser, or you get more evil even faster.
---
So much time spent shadow melded under the dock... And then you gotta decide if you can kill the one straggler before more arrive. 
---
This is amazing. I actually went and leveled a toon just to see if this would work. I was able to level tailoring to 300 at level 5. I was so unaware of this change. 
---
Thanks for the insight! 
---
That is great info. Thanks
---
Looks like great APU to pair with console like case. Thanks
---
I came here to say the same sort of thing. Almost all of the drama I have experienced in guilds have been when there have been women involved. Often to no fault of the girl. Playing games with girls seems to do strange things to people.
---
First off, you have the white knights. Say you're raiding and someone happens to fuck up, causing the entire raid to wipe. Now, say that person just happens to be a girl. Obviously she should be treated the same way as any other player would be, to learn not to repeat the mistake (especially if it was something really dumb). As soon as this happens, you suddenly have a handful of white knights jumping down your throat to protect "m'lady". This will carry on, building up more and more tension in the guild.
---
Secondly, you have the girls who become a bit too accustomed to desperate guys handing them everything on a silver platter. I'm not saying this happens to everyone, but it *does* happen. Eventually they start *expecting* free gold, help with whatever they want, and first choice of loot. This has literally happened in guilds I've been in, where women would throw a complete tantrum because a higher performing raider got an item over her. 
---
I'd say the problems that occur are mainly down to the male players who don't know how to act around people of the opposite sex. 
---
I do both div 2 is an absolutely epic rpg there is no shortage of competing products that are to my liking. Still gonna give my 2cents to improve this product by voicing my dissatisfaction with some things and promoting things I do like. The classic dev team does actually read this reddit I'm fairly sure off giving it's much less toxic then the classic wow forums:P
---
Everyone else has a possibility of innocence. There are no innocent undead rogues, only ones that haven't ganked you yet. 
---
&gt;Ride up to people with guns and take their stuff
---
I'm not exactly sure what you mean. But the obviously response is that is the government doesn't exist, then you're gonna have people riding with guns to take your stuff and it won't be because you didn't pay taxes. It'll be because they can. 
---
&gt;Pretty crappy option
---
The worst democratically elected representative is still better than the best autocrat. Because the best autocrat is just one calamity away from going on a murderous rampage, while a bad democratically elected representative can be voted out. Furthermore, this is the purpose of primaries. If you don't vote in primaries then you don't get to complain.
---
Oh hell yeah, voice it loud man. We should never fall silent.
---
So nobody ever noticed theres a massive dick lake on kalimador after cata? 
---
Cold Blood Eviscerate
---
The prefered premade spec is sm/ruin but you occasionally see SL on ab weekend for solo holding a flag.
---
you vastly undervalue COT, that + fear + dc+ dispel + silence and good burst makes for a valuable asset in the middle fight. Every gcd that gets wasted on COT is one that isn't spent doing anything more valuable, fear is also still a fantastic cc. CoT is fucking outstanding you aren't spamming heals or frost bolts if your dispelling cot, and if you were you are wide open to silences and losing substantial throughput. The only thing is warlocks are so good at spamming tongues that you really don't need more than one.
---
You are generally one of the first called back to help defend the FC ( although I have had groups that prefer other classes first)
---
That would help but in my scenario this would be a friend starting later. 
---
I never played in vanilla, but I have heard you can go for Nightfall/conflag and help burst people down.
---
Your defensive/offensive dispel and interrupt comes in handy too.
---
how rude
---
and pointless lol
---
What's an anal spammer? I would search it in google, but I don't want that history on my computer.
---
Id wait till summer and just play then, but what are the things that you remember from that time if any?
---
In what way? There‚Äôs almost no way I could make this as a non video 
---
What would you need to prepare for? On release day, setup a subscription, pick a server and create your character.
---
I was amazed how easy I got all the sound ones, considering I haven't played with sound since before I hit 60 in vanilla!
---
Absolutely. You lose Holy Shock (which you pretty much never use in raids) to slightly improve the performance of the most important person in the raid. Well worth it.
---
RP-PvP, pop cap 5000
---
In my ideal world, each patch comes out as soon as I have the content on farm and I've completed my set. Exception being bgs, I'd like them to be out on launch.
---
Op did you post this thread just to argue with people?
---
We know what they‚Äôve told us. Nothing more. What‚Äôs the point in worrying about everything we don‚Äôt know. Hell, Classic might be turned into a mobile game. We should definitely complain about that now because we don‚Äôt know that it won‚Äôt happen. 
---
That‚Äôs the thing. I feel like a total noob. Will probably be at a disadvantage from the get go.
---
On the other hand, I will be able to play wow as it was a first time. Maybe that‚Äôs not a bad thing.
---
He means stuff like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt vendor your skull of impending doom‚Äù
---
Look out for X
---
Save your Y
---
Don‚Äôt waste time doing Z
---
He‚Äôs basicly asking for a list of Dos and Donts and maybe pre raid BIS lists for his character, best professions to take etc
---
No
---
I was playing Warrior during Vanilla, as arms : The Unstoppable Force + Mace specialization, it was a great help to 1v1.
---
Perception as an active talent is actually quite powerful in PvP.  Will allow you to always get he opened on other rogues/druids.
---
I did.  Even though this is entirely my fault, I'm going to keep true to the WoW player mindset and blame Blizzard for it.
---
Not true, in that scenario if I got jumped I would scatter+feign death+freeze trap. Get to max range and do an aimed+multi+serpent combo and conch shot while out of range and burn them down.
---
If they berserk charge I will raptor strike, wing clip and scatter to land another combo, then deterrence to dodge attacks until freeze trap is up again. Hunters should never lose to warrior 1v1.
---
Thanks for the quick reply.
---
I thought so, its just that fear has such a short range, that you could get intercepted easily by a warr and obviously that locks get trained when the enemy has the chance.
---
I am still deciding on what to roll for classic.. Its either mage, rogue, lock or hunter, one of those 4. 
---
I am edging towards the rogue, but I heard that the tier 1 and 2 sets for them are actually better than the high warlord set.. also in premades.. I like to farm for my set and be able to use it.. otherwise its kinda like no fun for me at all to spend hours and hours for no gear and going for rank 14 for the weapons is a very slim chance for me.
---
Can‚Äôt get nuked down by mage when he‚Äôs getting ripped apart by your full BM spec pet, while you have TSA, scatter, stronger traps, more ranged distance, and wyvern sting.
---
While it may not be amazing on a lot of raid bosses, it REALLY pays off to have on trash. Imp packs in MC, Razorgore, Nefarian. There is a few bosses it really shines too, like Princess Huhuran (that last 30% the reflected damage adds a solid dps increase!)
---
I'm in the same boat with the same classes and mindset, unfortunately rogues are even rarer you see 1 or 0 on most premades. I'll probably end up going mage or Hunter even though my heart kinda wants to go rogue
---
Basically the female night elf hunter of the Horde. Overused and most of the time terrible, ganking those is doing the opposite faction a favor by keeping their population in check.
---
Because you aren‚Äôt going to bring in more subs that way. You already have one demographic subbing for bfa, why would you target the same demographic for classic?
---
I would honestly say don't do anything so you have the same sense of wonder that you experienced the first time you discovered the world. I wish I could go back to that.
---
They will just use the dungeon finder that blizzard is putting in. 
---
I mean if you think about it cata came out like what 8 years ago, so there are a lot of players who have never experienced the original barrens or old world in general. 
---
Zulian Stone Axe
---
Yeah, this one.. My dog of 15 years died exactly 1 week ago today.
---
Why not just play a single player game? 
---
These things were often impossible to know until you looked it up in thottbot
---
Lost count of my score,
---
Ended up somewhere around a cartman.
---
Conjure food would give you a few loafs of bread... Wouldn't keep your family going for very long!
---
Bannable from YT streams as well. I know a handful of people that used to stream on YT but don‚Äôt anymore because they got punished for it. 
---
The most fun I had was Affliction alliance warlock.  Ride in to Blacksmith AB, dot every horde player there. Use rocket boots to run away while they drop to half health and the Lumber Mill team dropped in from above to mop them up.
---
Assuming you survive the taming process, which you most certainly wouldn't against a Grizzly Bear.
---
This is pretty close to my thoughts, moving forward and relaunching expansions and allowing people to migrate over their character seems like the best of worlds for players.
---
Hooefully this isnt shut down by them having to use more servers/split server use to allow for this split if playerbase. 
---
A lot of people, myself included, are excited for vanilla wow. But I came in about halfway to 3/4 to TBC release and it is there I had my most experience at endgame and would like to get to that point again.
---
**&lt;Always East&gt;   |   Semi-Hardcore   |   PvP   |   Server Region: NA, but all are welcome!   |   Faction: Alliance**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"**  Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
\- We are players spanning throughout multiple expansions of Retail WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content.
---
\- We look forward to reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts.
---
\- We're looking for a more mature audience; 18+ only, please - some exceptions can be made if proven.
---
\- Everyone earns their spot with us, regardless if you are a Raider, PvPer or Social.
---
\- Above all else, we strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"**
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever!  At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up.  Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but again - as stated above - we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic.
---
\- While we want to progress efficiently through the current raid content, our goal is not to have a "server first clear."  See our raid times below for further details.  
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people!  We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics.  Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week, with a floating third when/if needed; **Wednesday and Thursday** (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - **NOT** when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than **8:15PM EST**.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around **10:00PM EST** for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than **11:45PM EST**.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be **PREPARED** and **READY** to raid when the time comes.  
---
**Reach out if you have questions!**
---
We can be reached at **Parker#1571,** **Tharkun#4460** or  **Kegg#8900** on discord.  Or drop me a direct message via Reddit.

R5: There's something in this map that is NEVER seen in any other EU4 game. Can you find what's wrong with the British Isles?
---
1. Break up with girlfriend

2. Sell your house/flat

3. Quit job

4. Move back in to parents basement

5. ???

Back in bc I was in the rank 2 guild of the server  played a rouge, had the most dkp the first gleve dropped and the guild leader appointed it to the other rouge who was his arena mate because he needs it to get gladi..... 
---
The same night I left with about 1/3 of the guild. Never cared what happend to the rest and or the actually managed to get gladiator.
---
True, and it's to prevent Holy Paladins from Heal Tanking. If they produced full threat and spam healed they'd produce enough threat to tank.
---
MURDERFRESH PLEASE FUCK MY BITCH
---
this man knows how to wow
---
Ranjii is a hero of the alliance, get shit on kid
---
Any  semi hardcore NA guilds that will be raiding later at night, like 9:00  p.m. PST. Prefer horde but willing to play alliance too if I can find a  good community.
---
I raided as a mage in Vanilla. Cleared MC, BWL, AQ 20/40, ZG, and Naxx, cleared spider, abom, plauge, and 2/3 DK wing.
---
In  TBC I played mage again for the first raid tier, then switched to prot  warrior and was OT for my guild through TK, SSC, BT, Hyjal. For Sunwell I  switched over to resto druid and killed M'uru (fuck this guy) pre 3.0  and KJ after. Class switches were at the request of the guild due to our  needs not me just class jumping.
---
Went  super casual in WoTLK and just pvp'd/arena'd while pugging around for  raids. Quit early into the expansion and also did not play during  cataclysm and mists. Came back at the tail end of WoD and cleared up to  Mythic Archimonde playing mage.
---
Played  in Legion and raided in a top U.S. 100 guild as a healing priest.  Cleared mythic EN and TV. Cleared 9/10 mythic Nighthold. I quit when my  daughter was born and my guild killed Gul'dan the week after.
---
And  now I am here, no interest to play retail from everything I have been  reading but fully pumped to play Classic. But between work and family  time, I can only play late night. I do not know what class I will play, I  am tossing around mage for nostalgia but would not mind going priest  heals or war tank.
---
Any warrior worth their salt is going to taunt your pet before you scatter/freeze trap and get out of it instantly.
---
You can switch weapons/shields in combat (and I think even while you're stunned???) so why would you want to stay 1H? Healing as Holy/Reckoning PvP, switch to 2H when you want to unleash your charges then switch back.
---
**&lt;Working Adults&gt; \[H\] US Pacific - PvP**
---
We  are all working adults now with a much greater time commitment to real-life and less free time to play than we did 10-15 years ago. But, we still want to progress and do the best we're able with the time we have to play. 
---
***We plan on being a semi-serious raiding guild*** with a very structured weekly raiding schedule to allow "older players" a chance to progress without burning out. Raids will be capped to ***twice a week and 3 to 4 hours per raid night***.
---
We are mostly PvE focused; PvP will be supported but not required. 
---
We currently have close to sixty members (and growing) with a core of almost forty that plan to raid; we would love a few more to help us progress on early content and beyond (as the grind to level 60 will take some much longer than others)!
---
***All classes welcome!*** *(but we could use more blacksmiths...)*

Best advice, play with friends 
---
&gt; In BfA like 70% of the damage a fire mage does is instant pyroblasts
---
pretty sure the highest damage source for fire mages is ignite in bfa
---
I know, I've read the guides. I'm going this route because I want to level with something I came up with myself, not something I read up online. Even if it's not strictly better at reducing my 1-60 time, it gives me a different tool kit to play with and that'll be fun. I also want the Imp Healing Touch, as I plan on healing dungeons and in group PvP and getting that quicker heal is a nice bonus.
---
I disagree on the druid thing, being able to play boomkin with hotw and swiftmend would be really strong. You would have to play caster druid though, feral wouldn't get as much out of triple spec.
---
I got Epic Vanilla Veteran. This was a great quiz, and a nice change of pace from the usual Vanilla content I watch.
---
You are hilariously wrong by the way. The default mode for world of warcraft was Normal. PvE servers were called "Normal" in WoW. And in the beta they didnt even add the PvP realms until right up against release.
---
This is verifiable by going to check the patch notes from 15 years ago. IIRC it was like 0.8 when they finally got around to testing PvP and deciding which zones would be auto flagged and which would not.
---
Not that this is surprising. PvE was always their focus, thats why the game shipped with 2 raids available but no PvP rank system at all and no battlegrounds. PvP was the afterthought. I think PvP in this game would have been ALOT stronger if they had given it the pre-release attention it deserved.
---
I'm feeling pretty attacked rn

 **\*\*&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA ‚Äì PvE| Semi-Hardcore\*\***
---
**\*\*Introduction**:\*\*  
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft‚Äôs launch on the Zul‚Äôjin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was ‚ÄúThe causal guild that raids hardcore‚Äù and we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  We expect to progress through raid tiers in quick order.  
---
**\*\*What we Expect of Members**:\*\*  
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It‚Äôs important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.    
---
For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time.  We also expect raid members to be well read in our raid strategies and able to follow the raid leaders instructions. 
---
**\*\*Guild Culture:\*\***
---
We want this guild to feel like home, as it did for the members who were part of the original KT guild!  We are committed to building a guild environment that is friendly and helpful and is respected throughout our server.  
---
**\*\*Raid Times:\*\*** 
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.  Sundays will drop off when content is on farm.

---
Yeah between Charge, Intercept, and fear you should be able to get a few hits off on a mage in between being kited, and with that gear discrepancy you only need a few hits.
---
LMAO. Boogie is so unintentionally funny.
---
Yikes dude
---
Sanctuary is not as desirable as something like Kings or Salv, obviously, but as long as you have 4 or more Paladins (so virtually every 40 man, and maybe some 20 mans), Sanctuary is going to be used.  
---
*Everyone wants Kings, so that's one Paladin on duty.
---
*Everyone wants Might or Wisdom, so that's a second Paladin.
---
*You've got a bunch of Paladins, so put Light on everyone for better healing so the 3rd pally is occupied
---
*And then everyone wants Salvation, so that's a Paladin #4.  Or, wait, not everyone wants Salv.  Tanks will toggle it off.  So, they have an open Blessing slot, and therefore you may as well give them extra damage reduction and threat, even if it isn't huge.
---
*In the event you hit 5+ Paladins in the raid, then may as well put Sanctuary on everyone.  So long as everyone's getting the primary blessings, may as well chip a little damage that slips through off them.
---
Added benefit to this (based on my experience being a vanilla prot paladin) - if you're the one who takes the plunge for it, it increases your chances of getting into raids when they are full.  You bring something to the raid that a Ret paladin doesn't, and if you grab Illumination in the Holy tree you'll be 90% of an equally geared Holy Paladin.
---
Molten Core finished in the first week? Which nerd with no life is going to be 60 in 7 DAYS!? LMAO this is original Classic, not a pirate server with increased rates
---
I can also be contacted via Reddit!

Easy there, much of the population is still sleepy
---
The degree of ignorance about capitalism really troubles me. Everything a business does is a ‚Äúmoney grab‚Äù but that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Blizzard would have never made WoW in the first place if it didn‚Äôt think that it could turn a profit. The magic of it is that it was worth it to them to sell the game for $60 (or whatever it was, I don‚Äôt remember) and to charge us $15/month to play it, and it was worth *at least that much* to us to play because of how good it was, so we both came out ahead. That‚Äôs how capitalism works.
---
The breakdown occurs when a seller (ActiBlizz) doesn‚Äôt really understand what the buyers want, and are willing to pay for, or when niche buyers with a lot of money (micro transaction whales) drown out the many low dollar buyers, so the company pushes the game in directions that don‚Äôt attract as many players, which is why they are bleeding subs like a sieve. It seems like they have begun to understand this however, so they are giving us Classic, and I am counting on them being smart enough to understand that the best way to grab the most money is to give us authentic Classic.
---
You're way too jaded and cynical to have a real conversation on this topic. The game will go the 07 scape route and be great
---
He is definitely not asking that.
---
They‚Äôre turnin‚Äô the freakin‚Äô murlocs gay!
---
Seems you're new here. 
---
Because I want to group with other real life people for quests, dungeons and raids? This question seems silly
---
People over-rate fear ward. Yes the first and second instance are very valuable to a raid, but after that there are massively diminishing returns. Min-maxed raids will prefer human priests to dwarves after a point.
---
For PvP or if you're just looking to pug alot than sure dwarf is the clear choice, but there are valid min-max reasons to go human priest.
---
I would advise to wait till realease. I was more or less in the same boat as you. But decided to play on a Pserver for a bit to help me decide on which class to play. And even though I'm loving my time on this private server. I do kinda feel. Damn I got to do all this leveling and grinding again in the summer.
---
Why should they want classic with bfa features?
---
Perhaps you'd be interested in &lt;Always East&gt;?
---
We are planning on going Alliance, but if that's not a deal breaker, check out my post. Might have to scroll around to find it.
---
A lot of us are in similar boats: players of days past, but now dealing with a kid, job, etc.  Let me know your thoughts and hit me up if you want to chat.
---
"Back to work!"
---
Bespoke: The man baby would go as well. He just doesn't get invited.
---
Yeah I think that will work for both. Some will still progress through Naxx even after months. And they can always release some new vanilla servers at that point. 
---
I've experienced vanilla on private servers and Wrath on retail, but never TBC so I really hope Blizzard will do something with that expansion. So many people tell me it's the best. 
---
Equal skill, gear, and everyone optimally specced, warriors should rarely win any 1v1. However, those are unrealistic expectations outside of tryhard dueling. Even then, you can get lucky with crits/resistances/misses etc. 
---
In reality, many people will be lesser skilled or geared, and running around with suboptimal PvE specs, lower HP, missing cooldowns. So you can still get plenty of 1v1 kills in world PvP/BGs. Rogues, hunters, priests, and warlocks are your best targets. 
---
Oh yeah. A lot of people like you who roll a Warrior are in for a reality check when Classic launches. 
---
The video is just you saying out loud what is written. Do you assume that everyone watching it are illiterate and so it needed to be a video?
---
Thanks for the correction! 
---
A lot of people are preparing on a private server. Can‚Äôt say which one but it‚Äôs not hard to figure out. 
---
Instead of trying to force my own play style on you like some people love to do, I'll ask a question before I can fully reply:  
---
Do you like to min/max and be the most efficient player you can be  
---
Or  
---
Do you like to explore the world, take your time, and enjoy the journey?
---
What part of "no politics in this sub" did you not understand?
---
Crossbows are best. 
---
"9/11 was an inside job! Look at the life insurance records!" 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôd be yelling about the Goblins being Globalists as well.
---
He's just making a joke about conspiracy theorists calm down
---
A good warlock can dominate the whole fight with cot, fear, coil, silence, pet dispel. I say good warlock because it takes some skill to coordinate everything correctly. Most warlocks like to dot everything and call it a day while his healer is still sheeped. 
---
"Operation Northwoods!" haha silly Peon.
---
6k-8k pop.
---
PVE
---
The initial patch cycle is fine by me. 
---
* Roll out the itemization changes at the same time intervals.
---
* A dedicated world chat channel created for the server.
---
orange man sad :*(
---
Was reading your recruitment and digging it until raid times came up. I am PST, your raids would be too early for me
---
It doesn't matter what he was trying to do. What he did breaks the rules.
---
Maybe when you're a little older you'll understand why it's important not to allow this.
---
I'm currently addicted to private servers but for a new player I'd recommend staying pure until the game officially launches. There's a great deal of mystery and excitement you'd be depriving yourself of by playing a pserver.
---
Understood.  Good luck to you!
---
Play on a private server. This will give you the feel of vanilla
---
This is very private server-y lol
---
Kill that cocksucka
---
I'd always /sit and watch when I saw another Warlock fighting a 1v1 in WPVP. If they can't win solo, they were weak.
---
You have to remember there is 13 years of theory crafting on this game now every bit of information you need or want is just 1 Google search away
---
Interfere of course. 
---
Work is da poop
---
What about priest fear?
---
and any hunter worth their salt would wait out the taunts which they easily can.
---
If they look like they‚Äôre going to win I‚Äôll let it play out. If not I help out. 
---
Everybody should consider taking skinning while leveling. It sells well during launch when all the leather workers are skilling up. And even when the prices inevitably crash due to oversupply it vendors for decent cash - thick 3s/ea and rugged 5s/ea. All from creatures you were killing any way. It's free real estate.
---
PvE Server  
---
Somewhere between original server cap and 2x server cap (2.5 - 5k) nothing more.
---
Pretty close to even split between factions
---
I do not want to play with any streamers or private server elitists. I want to play the game with people who are still learning and figuring things out.
---
I would prefer if MC wasn't released RIGHT away. Maybe 2 weeks after launch, to give people some time to enjoy leveling without feeling like they HAVE to rush. Following that I would like to get progressive patches that leave raids in their PRE-NERFED state. The game will already be "easier" because of the many many years of theory crafting etc. I still want a challenge.
---
 /bored
---
This isn't some japanese Bushido crap we are dealing here, this is WAR. Red is dead. No exceptions. (well, maybe greys)
---
Since it‚Äôs classic, I probably know both of them, so it depends on who I like.
---
All I gotta do is invest in a cage style bear trap. Or get a park ranger to tranq one.
---
Only if you run 5+ pallies or the pally who buffs salvation also does small blessings of sanctuary on the tanks. And then only really if the tank isn't dual wield tanking (yes that's a thing).
---
I knew a bunch of hunters that would solo farm the boss for them as raid arrows. At least thats what they claimed. I hate playing hunter it
---
s such an odd and wonkey play style to me.
---
Yeah warlock is my vote over mage/rogue. All the talent trees have a lot of damage synergy with each other unlike mage (3 separate elements), and their big 1 point talents are more impactful than rogue.
---
Obviously they'd all be monsters but so much of Warlock's power is tied up in their talents. If you did the same experiment with 0 talent points, pretty sure they're at the bottom.
---
Alexensual is arguably the worst content creator on the market, nothing but doom and gloom and a negative attitude about literally every single thing out of his mouth. There's a reason his channel doesn't get many views, because most people are aware of that and ignore him. I would recommend you do, too and maybe your irrational opinion of how others view you for wanting to play on a pve server will quickly change.
---
Depends on how much I like the person on my faction, or whether I just think it'll be amusing to watch them die.
---
He most definitely is 
---
im not saying weapon skill is bad, its certainly very good but its the +AXE skill that is useless.  If you need threat, ud want alcors or another fast weapon, you lower ur defensive stats so you take more threat = more rage.  This is why tauren 5% hp is so important so u can create a larger buffer to not die
---
At which point you're dead because you let a warrior sit on you for 3 seconds.
---
I used to be single target remover. (Destruction build in AQ40 gear)  All out one whatever target the BG leader gave me (usually a healer)  and apart from that obviously using as many curses and fears as possible to weaken the enemy. 
---
yes threat &gt; survivability, axes do not give the most threat, fast weapons do
---
you just proved ur own knowledge of tanking, if you think vael is the only fight where a tank can be rage capped ur wrong.  Very wrong, and proves u actually are just another basic tank with hardly any knowledge of how to play vanilla
---
Savage Gladiator Chain from BRD is a chain tank top on female models
---
Drop a moonfire and keep trotting.
---
Oh i get it and id do the same. But maybe you have been lfm for 30 minutes getting sick of looking for a priest.
---
implying warriors somehow oneshot hunters ? 
---
I'd wait until the duel is over. If the enemy wins, Ima go and finish the job lololo
---
I would play a pvp version of that
---
Bloodfang looks pretty ganky, so does D0
---
6,000 online players cap
---
50/50 Alliance/Horde
---
2-3 hardcore PvE guilds on each faction
---
10-12 casual PvE guilds on each faction
---
2-3 PvP ranking premades on each server
---
This would be the ideal experience for me personally
---
People who spam "ANAL [Item/Spell link]" in trade/general chat. Most popular is probably "ANAL [Dirge]". Don't know when this started, or who ever tought it was funny, but it's been a thing for years.
---
1. Do Nothing
---
2. Profit
---
The more you prepare, the less surprises you'll have when you do play.
---
Let the fight play out. If it looks like my guy is going to lose soon, quick heal, let him finish the other guy off. If somehow he still dies. I kill the other guy.
---
It‚Äôs a really old meme (at least in NA) for people to spam ‚ÄúAnal [ability/item]‚Äù in trade chat.
---
Examples include ‚ÄúAnal Hemorrhage,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnal Rupture,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnal Fireblast.‚Äù
---
It's a PvP server. There's your answer.
---
Not exactly a classic story, but, I started playing right at the tail end of vanilla. I remember my friend got me into it and would walk around with his level 22 rogue while I started out on the first of my many pre-10 alts. After my Dad watched me play one evening he decided to give it a go and probably surpassed my highest level toon in his first night. 
---
Fast forward to evenings of me watching him raid with his guild.
---
 I‚Äôll always remember him getting up for a break after a Naxx wipe and asking me to run back to the raid. I was probably playing a toon around SM-running levels and so when I got up to the giant floating dungeon and saw multiple portals I was confused. I picked up his headset and used the PTT to ask nervously which portal to take. The Vent lines erupted with different designations and threats for choosing the wrong area. I sat outside the raid until my dad came back and the whole guild started laughing. I was immediatly invited to join the guild on my highest level the next day, and was periodically sent leveling items in the mail by many of them. Really a great group of people. I never played a lot of end game content, but that community kept me coming back for years.
---
Really? I cannot for the life of me imagine that working out. Even by accident there is bound to be some people who click shit too eagerly.
---
A good portion of what I remember was doing spirit walks back to my corpse. 
---
No Fun Allowed! 
---
Can‚Äôt relate haha üòÇ 
---
But what about the fun Aussies???
---
You are the one saying a bunch of crap, acting like a douche and pretending you know stuff. Without alick of source. Haha. I love the idiocy of people that don't source. Reminds me oh to well of the left. 
---
Do the whole 1.0 through to 1.12 progressions with talents, dungeon/raid release schedule, itemisation etc
---
Normal vanilla populations. RP-PvP
---
After 1.12 do a 1.13 that includes...
---
Cap respec costs lower or add dual spec for 1000g and then it only costs 5g per spec after the initial 1k. Still have to do it at a trainer.
---
Fix up Prot/Ret Paladins, Boomkins and SPriests a bit to make them more viable in PVE.

Add Kara, ZA, Ghostlands, Blood Elves as a neutral race (no paladins), finish Hyjal, Azshara, Furlbog city, Grim Batol, CoT, Sunwell...
---
Add guild banks
---
Heroics
---
...basically add all the good TBC shit that was in Azeroth and not space. No space shit ever.
---
It's the only way. 
---
Hide and watch, and rez my faction player if they lose. Or, wait for the opposing faction to win, get to full hp, and /ready at them to have a go myself. 
---
Epic Vanilla Veteran! Heck yeah! This is a great quiz though you really should remake it into a different format, so people don't have to keep track of their scores.
---
Stay this madness!
---
It's really not a complicated game, you'll be fine.
---
This sounds like your post from 6 days ago. Have you thought of taking up a professional career in doomsaying?
---
Until they meet a hunter. Then they created to run and hide.
---
Horde raids do way, way more damage. Can‚Äôt even compete as alliance
---
All of this.
---
The standing rule of PVP in any mmo: Red = Dead. 
---
oh ok i didn't know
---
you're saying a fresh 60 with likely little pvp experience is going to stomp a r14 warrior who has played countless hours and knows their class inside and out.
---
You're delusional. FYI I play/have played on multiple private servers.
---
Like always, here's some sound advice for you virgins of the jungle:
---
1. Group up. There is safety in numbers, gankers are far less likely to target you if they see you are with someone, even if it's just one person.
---
2. Don't get paranoid. No, the jungle isn't crawling with stealthed Rogues just waiting for you to lower your guard, people really have better things to do, so relax. Most people just want to quest in peace, it's only rarely will someone go out of their way to gank you.
---
3. Learn the jungle. This won't take that much time, once you've spent a few hours in STV you'll start to get an idea about where the contested spots are and how to go around them. Avoid the roads as much as possible when Zul'Gurub is released as they will be crawling with 60's.
---
4. Use chat! When you approach Nessingwary's Camp, call out in general chat if it's clear of the opposite faction or not, if you get attacked try to stun or incapacitate them for a moment and call for help and give coordinates if you can, you never know someone might be nearby!
---
5. Don't give up! Sometimes you'll be happily questing and you'll get jumped by 3-4 people, or a level 60, you rez and try to move to a different area when it happens again, and you get the feeling that they won't stop. Don't get discouraged, just alt-tab for about ten minutes and come back, 90% of the time, the people/person ganking you would have moved on, bored waiting for you.
---
6. Help them! If you see someone getting ganked, and if the ganker is around your level, don't just stand there or run past, help them! 2 on 1 are far better odds so you'll either guarantee a kill or the ganker will run away and you might make a friend in the process, this is an MMO and most importantly you rolled on a PvP server, so PvP!
---
Server cap 7k
---
All blue and epic gear drop rate drop to 1/5 what it is now.
---
PVP gear removed from game and replaced by consumables and trinkets that while really good have long cool downs.
---
Progressive release of all Raids. All raids dropped in hardest form and left very hard but not impossible permanently. 
---
Slightly Higher pop Alliance faction.
---
Also I would Take Portals and Teleport away from mages and give them to Druids. Mages get too much already. Their quality of life is absurd. I think it's a good boost to a druid without really messing up the game.
---
I‚Äôm on a private / first time classic  made a gnome rogue. I hate the alliance side so I won‚Äôt be playing on alliance come launch. But I wanted to just see if it was nostalgia or classic would be dope and worth the resub. And it‚Äôs dope. So awesome. Took a bit to get to 12 bc I‚Äôve never played alliance so I have this adventure in me still. Finding chests are the best. Idk man. I wouldn‚Äôt prep but the hype is real!
---
so how do you ruin the aimed shot?
---
and standing to cast fireball will get you big pet pushback
---
I personally never trusted private servers so I advise against playing on them.
---
BUT
---
If you don't know, ALL private servers use opensource emulators, the code is legal and if you run it privately on your PC, you don't break any law.
---
[CMangos Classic](https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-classic) is the "go to" emulator for vanilla, it has a [playerbot feature](https://github.com/cmangos/issues/wiki/PlayerBot-Features) so you can play in group with summoned bots.
---
Here are the instruction for setting it up on Windows: https://github.com/cmangos/issues/wiki/Detailed-installation-guide-for-Microsoft-Windows
---
Don't burn yourself on it though, it's an emulator, Classic will be a bit different, but I find it useful to try and see all the classes, playstyle and crafting profession, useful to decide what to do when Classic comes.
---
uhhhh no
---
Neither does ISIS these days, I guess they both seen better days.
---
It depends on the situation. It was very common in classic for certain players on each faction to be well known and respected cross faction so that if you saw them or they saw you, you would play nice. That was pretty common when using the forums was really the only way to speak to people.
---
You also have to remember that you were a representative of your guild. If you started ganking people or engaging in suspect behaviour, other guilds would put you on the hit list. As i've mentioned before, even though it may seem "dishonourable", letting someone die in a 1v1 may actually be a net positive for you and your guild, so you may have to let it slide.
---
That being said, if its 2 on 1 or 3 on 1, fuck that lets mix it up you Alliance wretches.
---
Hahaha, the Destroyer of worlds. I too had that sword. Definitely one of my favorites. 
---
I always let them fight it out alone. If my faction member got his ass handed to him, he wasn‚Äôt worth saving. Maybe he‚Äôll toughen up next time for his sake
---
Did you PvP a lot? I think I remember that name!
---
This is wrong unless fighting vael (and even then it's due to unlimited rage which allows all white hits to be HStrike'd for max flat threat applications).
---
Lowering defensive stats from armor is something expected if u overgear the content since getting rage will be hell, but it's not something expected for progression, depending on healers' gearing since it's their job u r making harder. 
---
The same can be said with fast vs slow weapons. I've only seen Alcor's (or Julie's, following the 1.3 speed rate) used extensively either on Nostalrius times (due to threat mechanics being bugged in favor of fast weaponry) or Vael (already stated). The ultimate threat weapons I see considered are TF (1.9 sword...) and IF if well-geared (2.40...) specially for human but notice: having +skill for such weapons (axes in orc case) the glancing blow reduction it gives gives an edge to stuff like Deathbringer or Crul because of straight damage (thus, threat). 
---
HS is a flat threat bonus to an auto, doesn't scale aside from ur weapon damage AA and, since you shouldn't be rage capped in most cases so spamming it will be hard thus making 1.3 weapons weaker because of white hits being weaker (which means less threat...). This is all considering u have the appropiate hit pieces (Accuria, Don Julio's...) since missing with a slower weapon is worse.  
---
Just wait.  
---
I know what you mean. Good point. I can't wait to be a part of a guild again and work together to take down bosses. 
---
Anyone have a link to bradygames PDFs?
---
I've heard that before, but that's not the orgin on the name for me 
---
Recently i made a char to an RP realm and a class that i have never played before and kinda hated it too. Now im really enjoying bfa and the class so much that im thinking of making it in classic too.
---
Either the 4th or 5th paladin should go the 30/21/0 spec. One should spec for Blessing of Kings. A second should spec for Imp Blessing of Might and Wisdom. If your raid wants both Judgement of Light and Wisdom, then both your 3rd and 4th paladins should spec for those. If they deem Sanctuary more important than having extended and frequent double Judgements, then paladin four can spec for Sanctuary, otherwise paladin five can do it. In an ideal world, I think your healer breakdown would be something like 5 pally, 5-6 priest, 3 druid for progression. 14 healers is probably about the max you would want, but that leaves room for 5 paladins if you can get them.
---
Why do you think they would not be allowed?
---
Because respec caps out at 50g and it was a progression guild so they raided MC 2-3 times a week...
---
I figured I would rather be handicapped in raids than PvP but I never made it past the first raid because I didn't realise how awful Hemo spec was for dps lol
---
America = from south to north right ? People from the USA are not American there are U.S Americans. You don‚Äôt own the whole continent... 
---
I‚Äôm happy you also want to play with Mexican and Canadian ;) 
---
You'll be surprised at how much you'll remember from 2006 once you hop back in. At least i was when i started up on a private server a few years ago. I'd just make sure your pc is able to run modern wow client (it probably can). Anything else like getting a BIS list is information that will be everywhere once the game launches. You could join private as a way to network in game and maybe find a guild but i think most of them are pretty far along in progression right now so your options would be limited. 
---
I'm sure blizzard will enforce you to level past 19...so dumb Haha. Why would it be banned lol?
---
Alright! It literally means ‚ÄùTesticle‚Äù in Finnish ^^
---
I hope you find your old friends!
---
lol I was just laughing because "grizzly hills theme" is a big recurrent meme over there, chill down man
---
Pet isn't really a problem for mage because you can blink away from it, and it wont kill you fast enough. The Hunter would be useless because you literally would die in a few seconds max
---
I've helped people in that situation, and then they yelled at me for ruining their solo kill. Later, the same guys were fighting again and he lost, and this time yelled at me for NOT jumping in. So fuck 'em, do whatever you want lol.
---
This guy knows how you breed a strong army.
---
I love this story! And lol @ at those descriptions of their voices üòÜ
---
hatrix here. fun times. one of your guildmates had an autoinvite mod so we just grouped with him and promoted him to leader then jumped in MC to steal your instance.
---
[i forget how we got into ventrilo tho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS-QXO8-scQ)
---
Always step in to finish off a horde, best to get him out of the way before 3 more greenskins pop out from under a rock nearby. 
---
I guess it'll be handy if you don't have the internet and need to look up Murloc health.
---
only way to get honor is by getting honorable kills.
---
&gt; You also have to remember that you were a representative of your guild. If you started ganking people or engaging in suspect behaviour, other guilds would put you on the hit list. As i've mentioned before, even though it may seem "dishonourable", letting someone die in a 1v1 may actually be a net positive for you and your guild, so you may have to let it slide.
---
What planet was your server on that ganking people got you put on some sort of list? What does that even mean?
---
Gank all day.
---
Now I'm not going to defend Activison, but clearly someone has hurt or betrayed you in the past. If you don't deal with that psychologically, you're only ever going to see the worst in others, which makes the world a terrible place to be.
---
Which is way different than lower actual level, because hunters will just bestial wrath during leveling. 
---
Yeah the server I'm on I'm about to the point where I'm gonna vendor all my leather.
---
If I knew alliance leveling as much as horde, I'd switch to alliance.
---
How is something that is build to be in maintenance mode can fall ?
---
They just want to close the private server and make people play on official and sub-based server.
---
This is gonna work ! They need 3k players to make it work and trust me they gonna have 10x that amount of player.
---
Even the progressive EQ1 server is alive and do great and it never got close to WoW classic reputation !
---
Cash grab ? Yeah maybe.... but we get what we actually ask. We asked for a classic server by Blizzard. That‚Äôs what they give us. Nothing less, nothing more.
---
Now you‚Äôre making nonsense up? I never said any of that. I said a R14 Warrior will struggle against a fresh 60 Mage. 
---
You‚Äôre clueless. 
---
I concur with the general sentiment of red equals dead. The question then becomes. Do we kill our enemy before or after our faction member dies. To which I say. Am I farming? If so watch the ally do what I can not and kill my rival. Then kill the Ally. If I am just passing through. Then just kill the ally. 
---
Hi, /u/Luciifur95
---
Try to think about your goals and possible role. 
---
Acquire realistic expectations about capabilities of each spec in the end game. 
---
This release schedule makes a lot more sense than what they proposed.
---
I interfere. Beause it's what I would have wanted if I were the opponent, it gives them the opportunity to have some epic moments.
---
Winning a 2v1 is way more epic than a 1v1, specially if you are recording for your PvP video.
---
So, real talk, Alex Jones has never said anything racist or even in line with racist tropes as far as I know, and I used to listen to him at work to break up the boredom. It‚Äôs just something repeated by people that have never listened to him, but know that he is bad because the TV tells them so.
---
That said, a lot of what he says is unsourced nonesense (but then, so is a lot of CNN) which is why he is best listened to as a kind of entertainment, with an enormous grain of salt. He‚Äôs  also a huge self promoter and pushes silly ‚Äúnatural remedies‚Äù endoresed by total quacks, which gets annoying. At least he seems to have fun with what he does, and can be fun to listen to.

That's what I have managed to find over the years...if there are more, I'd love to see them.
---
And moonglade the only zone.
---
Bring your own zimtschnecken
---
They will be allowed. But you‚Äôre mostly going to face other twinks. 
---
If the target gives honor then I am killing it. Especially while leveling, every bit of honor matters as you want to get the rank 3 PVP trinket as soon as you can. 
---
I don't play private servers anymore for the same reason. What's the point? I'll save my breath for Classic.  
---
As badly as I want to play, I'd rather the experience take place on the official platform.  
---
I do log on to pservers from time to time, either to check something for my preparations, or to see if someone out there is worthy to receive my unbound Frostsaber that I still have.  
---
Of course not. Obviously all twinks will banned because... because reasons!
---
Ye u need pots and grenades to kill me, but if I don‚Äôt have something like that and the warrior hits hard, it can get annoying, potentially, sometimes.
---
No. Blizzard will delete all level 19s that are packing gear.
---
I mean, what kind of question is this?
---
Your last point, but in every big City 
---
Eng is an absolute must when it comes to warrior vs being kited 
---
I agree. Prep for Cold Blood, Blade Flurry, and AR on top of KS, vanish, sprint etc? It just seems like the control is off the charts as well as the damage. 
---
It doesn't matter how much survivability or burst other classes have if they have no opportunities to use them.
---
This has happened to me a few times on my warlock so far. I ended up killing them both, and tea bagging them.
---
Ohhgee's premade guides are worth watching:

---
Red is dead, don't care how fair or unfair the fight is. Low level anything always kill
---
lol
---
Strip down and /dance furiously
---
then get back to the game and interfere 
---
No but without exp locking and exp locked BG's you won't be able to fight only other twinks and will have to resort to easy kills of legitimate leveling toons.
---
But then that's what you wanted all along.
---
I choose whatever ends in more dead Allies.
---
They want new/old players, as in more people paying. What on earth would be the point of making it appeal to people who are already playing retail? That wouldn't get them any money..
---
Probably the best response you could post. Now get the fuck outta here you clueless moron and go learn vanilla pvp before I camp your scrub ass. 
---
I'm no aladin master, but assuming that reck charges don't vanish when you change weapons, I'd say that it's probably better to tank the rogue/etc damage with a 1h+shield and then swap to a big, slow 2H when you are actually using the reck charges.
---
So, I don't know why would anyone hit reckoning with 1h+shield (again, unless swapping weapons resets reck charges, then t would make sense).
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; - EU Horde, Raiding &amp; PvP, is recruiting knowledgeable players.**
---
**Introduction:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive ! The plan this time is to push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from the first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. For this, we are providing a very strong core of original &lt;Hate&gt; officers, along with our quite massive experience in both raiding and PvP.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
To be knowledgeable and dead serious about raiding. Should be noted that &lt;Hate&gt; is a place to be for really good players, not a school for beginners.
---
**Our Raid Schedule:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week, starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
**Bottom line:**
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don‚Äôt be shy and join our Discord server: https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK or directly apply to [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/)
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
If they don't srsly plan on going through Naxx, then I have even less understanding of the 100 OSRS, Runscape and what comes after Naxx posts. 
---
Everyone in this sub hates hardcore raiders anyway, why would anyone even care if they leave.
---
And since I don't want to play an Activision game, I will know when to leave.
---
;)
---
https://i.imgur.com/kEiFd4s.png
---
lol vanilla expert over here
---
fyi a fresh 60 is doing 600 damage with a frostbolt. they'd be lucky to get one cast off against a r14 warrior with trinkets. 
---
You can (and will) still be crit while sitting.
---
What You can't do is get buffs like reckoning if you force a crit via sitting.
---
So basically I made an Alliance poster back in the day and literally glued it to my wall. If I wanted to take it off, I would have to repaint the wall a couple times. And now, I am gonna be a Hordie... 
---
Haha! Yeah, that's pretty cool. I played on 4 different servers in vanilla and the only person I'm still ever in contact with is Hatrix. I just messaged him yesterday and he said he'll play again for sure and bring Bove along with him. There were just so many "acquaintances" in all the guilds that it was hard to remain friends with any of them. I always wonder if some of the people I raided with are still playing WoW or going to ever play again.
---
You know how most of the people in those guilds were already older and getting married, etc... I just feel like there's no way they're even still playing MMO's or PC games at all. Kinda sad.
---
**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone! 
---
We are an alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual". 
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory. 
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO. 
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004. 
---
**Raid Times (PST):** 
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders. 
---
**Membership:** 
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They      will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things      with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the      end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend      recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that      is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of      Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a      period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move      on. When they come back, its like they never left. 
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the      effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to      keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100%      sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they      are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have      a full 40 members every raid. 
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to      keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no      special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known      each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is      great for members of our guild. 
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and      stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any      major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and      will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals. 
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

As a man you let them finish the fight. The opposing faction is fighting for his life and if he slays your teammate it just proves he wasn‚Äôt ready for battle. 
---
I let them finish the fight and let them live (should they win) until I encounter them again on my own. 
---
50/50 A and B even in full group of friends.
---
if with atleast one random then ofcourse b.
---
2v1 isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúhonorable‚Äù kill no matter how the game rewards it. 
---
I go with B if I don't know the folks.  
---
I need on everything I need. The rolls make it fair.
---
Cannibalize has no cast time, but it has channel time.
---
I‚Äôm wondering more if BGs will even pop for low levels for the first few months. On fresh private servers, it‚Äôs pretty rare to see low level BGs going until 4+ months after launch. 
---
I‚Äôd be really disappointed if at Classic launch, no one queues for BGs because I want to stop at each bracket for a bit to PvP and catch my professions up

Also, nice CNN jab there. Fail and balanced TM CR,

Pet out vs warrior is a liability, feeds them rage when attacking and if you can't get rage to close distance you can attack the pet for a quick intercept.
---
Respect the 1v1, always.  
---
See I am struggling to get traction with BFA as it stands! There just seems to be diablo like repetition with WQ's and Heroics being the main catch up merchanics for :/
---
Yeah!
---
Also, look up benchmarks of the 2400g on YouTube and overclock benchmarks. I know that the 2200g, on a beefy overclock, can do apex legends on all max at like 30-40fps average, so the 2400g will be an even greater beast. 
---
It's fine as a video. It would have been difficult to do the sound quiz (my favorite part) without it being a video. 
---
Yeah I agree! It sucks though because I would love to have been able to experience it sooner! I just know that it will Kerb my enthusiasm on the game release!
---
Alliance premades are top for two reasons. Firstly you are underestimating how big the alliance advantages for pve actually are. Fear war, Paladins and, Humans pretty much make a pve Trinity horde can't box with period. Human sword spec is one of the most insane things in classic pve as rogues and warrior dominate the charts.
---
This causes the Alliance to on average have much higher gear scores then horde. Because of this Horde tend to dominate pvp through BWL because the raids are easier and gear matters less but after AQ40 and Naxx drop. The raids get much harder and horde that can do it begin to fall off quickly. This also leads to alliance premade domination.
---
The other reason Allies win premades is because paladins. In bg pvp and any form of group pvp. Shamans are a steaming pile of crap compared to paladins. Paladins are the most OP support class in classic pvp by a mile. Especially after Naxx. 
---
Oh!

And the Ryzen 3000 series will be coming out later this year, too. The next version of the 2400g will be the same price and more powerful, and I'm pretty sure the 3000 line will be released before classic.
---
So you get get a next gen cpu OR get the 2400g for cheaper than $129.
---
Is this not kinda like the gun argument?Like "Guns dont kill people,people kill people"? 
---
What is stopping you from having like a max 2 hour sessions a day,other than self-discipline ?
---
Typically with friends it's always who needs it more, in a dungeon with pugs I would talk to people prior to the boss. If I'm on my last piece of pre-raid bis I'd be pissed if a guy that can get 4-5 upgrades needs on the only thing I do
---
I usually let them get it on, but if the opposing faction representative looks to be winning, i‚Äôll interfere lol
---
You'd have to have a ridiculously high bar for "racism" to think Alex Jones has never said anything racist. Even giving that, he's absolutely an antisemite and his conspiracy theories obviously play into antisemitic tropes. 
---
If our guy is winning, let them have at it. If losing, help the guy out. It feels better if you win a 1vs1 without help
---
Warlocks with Felhunter out* (or demo spec and able to sac VW and summon FH in 0.5 s)
---
That freaking Felhunter pet is such a mage bane. Imagine he's just as tough on Priests too
---
Doubt it will be hard to find games in the first few months. The game will have plenty of players. It wont be hard to get low level bracket matches until after a few months when people quit and/or only play their higher level mains
---
Mages struggle against the other casters, as a lot of their kit is based around dealing with non-casters. Counterspell and fireward vs warlocks are your only spells that counter anything they do
---
Control .  
---
(CoT, Fear, Spell Lock, Death Coil, Devour Magic + CoEX in WSG).   
---
A locks contribution to control is far more than just CoT, although that's absolutely crazy good by itself. If the opposing team are decursing they aren't doing more harmful things.  
---
Ranged Burst   
---
Don't play SL in group PvP and sacrifice your burst, it's the worst spec by far. Once warlocks start to get some gear their burst damage can be pretty nuts with Ruin crits. Shadowbolt + Shadowburn with crits is basically capable of globalling people on it's own. 
---
Played warlock to R13 on a private server and was always taken to the mid fights. Only left to defend forward  bases in AB once we had taken them. They used to want the locks in the mid fights to blow people up. Kind of more important for alliance, as horde have ele shamans for this.   
---
Large fights are all about the control and burst mentioned above. Smaller fights Warlocks CC and dots are amazing.   
---
CoEX can be pretty strong in WSG, during mobile fights. Same premise as CoT, if the enemy team have to decurse it to keep up they aren't doing more dangerous things.   
---
Rogue have pretty niche roles in Premades. Defending or ninjaing bases in AB, defending and running down FC's in WSG. Usually better to have another warrior for the group fights. Rogue's are very CD dependant so not great if constantly in the action.  
---
Out of the four classes you mention, mage gets the most use out of the PvP gear as their tier sets have a distinct lack of stamina.   
---
What? Why not? Its war. Not some jousting match
---
I didn't know TF and IF count as axes..... we are comparing orc racial to tauren, even in ur argument for TF and IF  being the "ultimate threat" weapon, orc gains no benefit from those.  And for max threat tanking, u absolutely lower defensive stats for more rage, alcors is best.  
---
Im not saying orc racial isn't good if you choose orc and wish to tank, but choosing orc specifically and saying it is the "BEST" tanking race on horde is wrong
---
dont be mean to the dude, but no dude there is no problem making a twink, i dunno if they have the xp off thing though?
---
What about ghost wolf to close the gap
---
Personally, I‚Äôm really impatient so I started playing on a private server just to get the feelz for it. I‚Äôm not a true vanilla player I started playing around a month before BC released but I still feel it‚Äôs not a far cry from where I started and I love it. Plenty of people on the server to group and quest. 
---
I‚Äôm having a blast so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs totally your call, if you are patient enough to wait then the gods be ever in your favour!
---
Lol I've never understood paper game guides. Downvote me to oblivion but I just don't get it.  
---
Always B when I'm not with friends.
---
How old are you?
---
Cause man. It‚Äôs war. Man on man. Not 2 men on one man.  Now if it was like a battleground or something that‚Äôs different but just walking into someone else‚Äôs town and challenging them that‚Äôs gotta be 1 on 1 to the death. 
---
Depends entirely on the class
---
Is it a fellow healer ? Yes 
---
Is it a ‚Äúpure‚Äù dps ? , he dead I don‚Äôt care 
---
The innocent ones are targeted for picking Undead Rogue. They then think World of Warcraft is a ruthless world, and then become gankers themselves. Trapped in the cycle
---
Want instant to 10 minute queues for PvP? Roll alliance. 
---
Want to [look like this guy before your queue is done](https://i.imgflip.com/75awb.jpg)? Roll horde.

War is different from dueling. Not many veterans that have fought in real wars would be pleased to hear you telling about their dishonor in defending their country because they weren‚Äôt equal in numbers with the enemy
---
[Just dropping this here to show ](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/the-hate-report-infowars-is-the-gateway-drug-for-white-supremacists/) how places like infowars are a breeding ground for hate and white supremacy. He‚Äôs been neck deep in Islamophobic rhetoric forever. There is a neat little list in the article o linked and you‚Äôll notice a trend in it. He only vilifies people of color, immigrants, or the left wing. Was it a white guy? False flag. George Soros funded protestor. Blah blah.
---
There is a very clear indication of racial prejudice when it comes to Alex Jones. He‚Äôs an absolute moron, and he screams the small details loud, but he‚Äôs still smart enough to not give the whole thing away. Also, if you look into the things that got him started in conspiracy... like it‚Äôs an antiseminte‚Äôs wet dream. 
---
whats not to get?
---
where else would you get the information from?
---
I will let them duel. I would be upset if someone helped me (or them), so I am just obey ye olde golden rule. 
---
Option A leads to drops earlier in the instance that are upgrades going to greed as people save up their one "polite" roll for the biggest upgrade in the instance. Imagine a 10man UBRS where no caster will roll on any of the cloth before Drak because they wall want a shot at the turban.

8th grade. I think that was in 2005. Haven‚Äôt played for a few years but looking forward to joining the new Classic community.

PvP doesn't give xp.
---
Me full nax geared with MoM and scarab lord as enhance while everyone else is rocking dungeon gear.
---
Damn pservers really shuts down some people's brain and manners heh?
---
What is the actual difference between PvP and RP PvP servers? I have never really gotten into the RP scene, what does it actually mean in WoW or how does it show?
---
Oh wow, I struck a real nerve. I don‚Äôt even want to argue with you, I kind of feel sorry for you to be honest. Have a good day.
---
I am such a big fan of bestiary's. I wish it was more of a trend in gaming to have them. The one in FF10-2 was fun and getting books like this and in DnD were cool. I think breath of the wild has one that you make if I remember right. We need more of this!
---
Ah, don‚Äôt want to have a conversation because you don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on. Gotcha. Get back to T_D, I bet they miss you.
---
then why it say +59 honor after the dude dies?
---
For my main I'm planning to grind mobs for most of my way to 60, I'll do quests and level slower on my alts that I don't care about.
---
Some say no some say yes 
---
I don‚Äôt remember at all , we‚Äôll just have to wait 
---
I would say that play some other game, take a break from wow and maybe try it again when classic comes?
---
All this thread confirms is that no one really has no idea what Classic is going to be like.  It's all speculation until we see it in person.
---
You must be younger. This is from back when we needed stuff like this. People didnt have high speed internet and smart phones in their pocket. If you didnt have this guide you would have to log out and spend 10 minutes on the internet trying to pull it up. 
---
Yep! You sure showed me! +1 internet points for you. Go tell your mom, she will be proud of you.
---
Its a game bro.
---
Lol let me be clear, my comments don‚Äôt apply to REAL wars. That‚Äôs much different, do what you gotta do to defend your country / get home. 
---
Now in digital wars i.e world of WARcraft. It doesn‚Äôt count as a win if you don‚Äôt do it alone. 
---
I guess that's why I'm fucked on my alliance favored p server. I never gank anyone I find it boring. But I'm constantly being ganked
---
The only enforced difference is there are restrictions on non fantasy names. If youre named "xxxpwnzuxx" or something and you get reported enough you have to change your name.
---
Other than that its just encouraged to get in character as youre grouped, trading, etc. Its all up to the community, and not everyone rps all the time.
---
Always help a brother out.  Murder that Alliance scum.
---
Well, the other guy is dead, I‚Äôm alive, its a victory no matter how one curses my dishonour while corpsewalking.

&gt; Bloodfang
---
[this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/d/dc/Forsaken_Bloodfang.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060921143411) is what almost made me play undead rogue back in vanilla. Best classic set in the game (apart for one more iconic one - you can guess what class I ended up playing lol)
---
Take my time and enjoy the ride for what it is. I'll worry about addons later.
---
Your choice really.  Me personally, I take my time.  I enjoy the journey, at least the first time around.  I often level alts at the same time too though, and craft.  I'll hopefully be doing a good bit of bgs with it.
---
Some people like to min/max though.  Doesn't mean we all have to.
---
There is no xp in BGs
---
Some had macros that said "1vs1" to let you know.
---
Kill me all
---
Alright. Does RP:ing in character mean talking in certain way(like a shaman for example, yelling for the aid of the elements :D) or just acting more mature than in normal pvp servers? 
---
Nah, my moms a crazy right wing lunatic like Alex Jones. Bring verifiable claims to an argument and they just vanish, it‚Äôs super interesting. But I‚Äôll take the Internet points though.
---
Basically this but with an authentic Vanilla 2.5-3.5k concurrent player cap.
---
I‚Äôve played WoW for 12 years and never once felt the need to make a support ticket
---
Play with as few addons as possible IMO, I'm on a private server currently clearing Naxxramas and other than using Luna for unit frames and questie, I use nothing else.  Keeps the game difficult and lets you see how your actual ability is.  
---
FWIW I'm playing an Orc Restoration Shaman.
---
What are you talking about?   People love classic gaming.  Did you notice how the NES classic sold out in about 5 minutes?
---
There's no other MMORPG currently available that fills the same type of niche that Classic will.  There are going to be at least a few tens of thousands of folks that will stick with it.
---
Instant quest text does not require any addons, it's a built-in feature. 
---
&gt;addons that remove the flavor from classic
---
That's a very personal definition of what exactly it is. And I don't think you should speak for everyone in this situation. Just play the game the way you want and that's it.
---
Both. Unless you wanna rp as an immature rogue or something 
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say younger than the modern internet.
---
I used to get Nintendo Power magazines when I was a kid.  Best reading ever.
---
No it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs an MMORPG, r-tard. 
---
B, always B. Let the rolling system decide. Only exception if it's a friend and I'm being nice.
---
I don't remember anyone really doing A in my time in '04-'06.
---
Yeah and there is a group of people out there that think it‚Äôs doable. Im with you 100% though.
---
Oh that's the worst.  It's like a lion toying with a baby deer.
---
Who can forget their reliable, trusty Anal Stiletto?
---
Take a look at some youtubers with vanilla content, but not too much so you‚Äôll still have lot to re-discover!
---
As a horde i let the enemy kill the friendly player first, then i kill him. This way i get 2 dead allies. I hate everything that can have ally in their name!!!!
---
I think everyone has there code, for me, with no information on the nature of the fight, I have no choice but to assist my faction member.
---
I however abhor ganking and if I see that my faction member was the aggressor, I usually move on. If I dont have conclusive proof that he was the aggressor though, even if it looks like he probably was, I always give the benefit of the doubt and assist.
---
Well, it is different in a few ways, but most of it is the same. Will try to explain.
---
First of all, most people are just normal and chill, but you have some "RP flavour" in group content and such. Unless you are incredibly dedicated you won't really RP in comms and such with your guild while raiding. An example of this might be something like "May i suggest a mana break?" instead of "stop pulling idiot or u will die" 
---
You see a lot less names like "itamedruids" for Hunters and a lot less "clever" word-plays/puns on character names to get around profanity filters and such. On an RP realm, no one wants to be friends with "buttjuice" even if you think that name is funny. On retail you can actually be forced to switch your name by a GM if you have a name as such. It doesn't even have to be crass or rude.
---
RP servers are generally more Alliance dominated because humans and nelfs are prettier and their overall "archetypes" and racial lore is easier to act out. Also, Goldshire. 
---
In my own personal experience, RP servers are generally more chill and the people are nicer. Not saying everybody on them are saints, nor that anyone not on RP realms are shitheads, but in general they are just more pleasant to deal with. Also, all the oddballs and the quirky people go there, so you see a lot of weird and funny things there. One of my best friends back in the day was an Undead without a jaw, so all he did was emote and mumble/gargle stuff. Quested, did dungeons, did PvP and so on, never said a word to me, ever. 
---
You will find some "elitist" RP'ers that do nothing but lord about how shit your RP is, be it your backstory or lack thereof, how you are not totally "in character" all the time etc. You will also find some people that create a character just to tell you that you are a loser for playing on RP servers.
---
Sometimes there are big RP events organized by players/guilds. These can be anything from just traveling places, raiding Stormwind, big 1v1 duel tournaments where everyone puts 2-3g in the pot and the winner takes it all etc.
---
But overall it is still a PvP server. Just the populace will be mostly different people that generally care more about the "flavour" in the game. You see a lot less "gogogogogo", if that makes sense. Most people won't give a shit if you act "normal" either, but if you actively go out of your way to ruin events/immersion then you will be blacklisted harder than most ninja looters.
---
Unless it's friends or a guild, always B.
---
With guilds it can be whatever.  I personally find DKP more trouble than it's worth, and can be a recipe for drama.  I think 1 piece per person per raid is a good rule in guild runs.
---
Hey that's why you have a quest journal.
---
I pretty much instantly go into attack mode when seeing the other faction. However I never kill grays unless they are beating up on my faction. 
---
I'd take a few things into factor, but number one would be whether that specific enemy faction player had jumped me before then I'd probably get involved.
---
Uh oh... I'm starting to think maybe the people playing classic wont be quite as fun to play with as those from vanilla.
---
&gt;Bottomline: I don't feel like paying for a sub-par product compared to a free alternative that's the same only better.
---
People are getting creative with their mental gymnastics to justify continuing to use the free private servers once classic is available again from Blizz. Now they just can't possibly justify paying for the legit version of Vanilla because Blizz layed off support workers apparently. 
---
ill do a mix. i can enjoy the process and still reach 60 at a competitive time.
---
World of Warcraft: Prepare to Die edition
---
Haha that jawless undead is great. Thanks for this info. Maybe I‚Äôm consider RP pvp server instead. Could be fun, even though I might feel cringey sometimes if the roleplaying gets too deep lol
---
So basically the guild should grow to the point that you consistently get 40 players online for raid time and have a good balance of players. Thats baseline goal. Too much recruiting beyond that isn't going to help your guild at all and may even cause issues. If you hit 40 players ontime for raids every time with 50 players in the guild great. If it takes 60 fine. Hate to say it but you need to focus on your healers and your tanks. The rest comes naturally. Once you progress into later raids you will probably want to groom a few replacement raiders incase you lose your core or they get bored. This isn't hard to throw half your newer recruits into the older raids since alot of your geared players may not want to run them anymore anyway since no matter how far into raiding you go you'll still be farming MC for bindings etc. But in general your guild needs to just manage to get 40 people online ontime and that's the ideal size to start with IMO.
---
There is no real way to tell how active your members are. Sometimes you need to invite some because you can never fill the last 5 spots only to bench 10 people next week. Both create frustration. And you need a solution for when ZG releases. Many go for a split raid but it is important to avoid a second class raid B.
---
Generally you can never have too many members before you are regularly raiding, and you should never stop recruiting anyone you can get that isn't an immature clown. It's a serious struggle to get enough reliable people together to do raid content as people are going to be leaving constantly for greener pastures until you're regularly clearing raids.
---
If the question is just total number of people, and not ideal class composition, then general rules of thumb we had during Vanilla:
---
* In any given raid about 5 of your "varsity" raiders wont be able to make it.
---
* "Alternate" raiders usually leave your guild if they dont see action in 4-6 weeks.
---
* You want about 6 "ambitious" alternates, anymore and you risk them leaving and pulling other members with them
---
* The best alternates are "old farts" who log on when they can, and dont care how many opportunities they have to join raids. You can never have too many of these. Unfortunately, the same traits that make them good alternates also usually make them un reliable.
---
* The most important thing is to have adequate access to "alternate" tanks and healers. DPS is the easiest fill-in to find, network with other raid guilds and you can often "soft share" your pools of backups.
---
How does he write the sound the creatures make? Lol
---
Watch my brother fight it out. If he is about to die I‚Äôll intervene. 
---
It's an unclassified debuff, same way Mortal Strike or Gouge is.
---
For raids, I find guilds without DKP or other similiar system troublesome. Call me greedy or anything else you like, but even if its a guild run, if something drops in a raid that is the only thing I have been needing in that raid for the last 3 months and have been waiting and building up my dkp or whatever just for that so I can get it for sure. Now, if there were no DKP system and the person who just joined the guild last week gets that item, there is no way I feel that "1 piece per person per raid" is a good rule nor do I think it is fair.
---
Yeah, it can be. But there isn't anything wrong with opting out of the deep RP stuff. Personally i always nope out when people have really edgy and tragic backstories and such. 
---
If i was playing solo and not with my irl friends i would 100% be going on an RP server. Will probably create an alt there at some point. In most games i play i always do some off the cuff light RP in my head. Like, having a hunter that hates eating cheese and you just vendor every cheese food item to buy bread or whatever won't impact your overall gameplay much, but those tiny things makes me a lot more invested in my character. And that is what Vanilla was all about for me. It's about the journey. 
---
Making friends on RP servers is incredibly easy, so you will easily find a crowd that fits your overall "style" of RP relatively quick. 
---
I plan on down loading the game and playing. Don‚Äôt really need the add ons until I get to raids. If I end up in a raiding guild I‚Äôll get the guild required ones and figure those out. For just running around I never really found any that helped out that much. 
---
"&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore"
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like. We have chosen to run with the suicide kings loot distribution method as well.
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel that is fresh, still getting everyone invited to it. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.
---
Bnet: Feral#11785 Discord: Feral#0846 
---
If it‚Äôs evenly matched let them do their thing. If it‚Äôs a wash? Well, I‚Äôm not trying to end up in someone‚Äôs PVP montage, but maybe I‚Äôll help? 
---
You're looking at Fear Ward in a vacuum. I.e its effect on only one person (the tank).  
---
The more FWs you have available to the raid, the fewer total raid members will be affected by fear per fear cycle.
---
The longer a fight goes, the worse fear effects get for Alliance because FW is on a 30 second cooldown. The only solution to that problem is to have more Dwarf Priests.
---
Healing output, or total healing per spell cast is not so finely tuned in classic that you ever encounter a boss fight where the extra 5% spirit from the Human racial is a necessity to make it through an encounter.
---
Its a fucking game do whatever you want. 
---
There was no such qualifier in the OP.
---
There is no guide for taking it slow because you can do so without guides. Speedrunning and hitting 60 as fast as possible takes skill. Doing the same in 4x the time does not. It may be more fun though (for you).
---
Mobinfo. RIP, GG
---
I agree it‚Äôs way too early to think about additional content post Naxx. Let‚Äôs all just hope Classic will be true to what Vanilla was first.
---
BT with full Bm talents, on top of Full MM and Full Surv, hunter is probably higher up than this thread is giving them. Mage can blink but he ain‚Äôt  stopping a Wrath Brokentooth, and he isn‚Äôt going to keep his distance either.
---
FRESH!!!!!!
---
For me it depends on the classes and levels.
---
I'm afraid I have to cut this discussion short now because it's not very productive.
---
CHAAARGE!!
---
&gt;hitting 60 as fast as possible takes skill.
---
Eh, no.  It takes memorizing quest routes, a little bit of luck, and basically having no life for a week straight so you can finish.  
---
What others said. Also you should partner up with another guild. It is much easier to create 2 good raids from 2 guilds on a night than 1 raid from 1. There are always nights when you have more ppl than you need and there are also times when you need that 1-2 more healer or an off-tank. The other guild can help in that case.
---
It's one of the more obnoxious things about retail, too. Since you can pair it with achivements. Anal [For the Children!] gets tiresome quick. 
---
If a version of atlas and atlasloot is available I'll probably download it, only because I hate getting lost in WC and like to be able to lookup dungeon drops.
---
He is a piece of shit and deserve some serious karma for this
---
Download all my addons and take my time. So a mix
---
You know, I really REALLY like this.
---
30.
---
Yeah, then he'll know how to be the most boring person at parties.
---
Yeah but some fights are inherently unbalanced.  If an enhance shammy comes across a hunter while leveling, that shammy is fucked.  Some classes are automatic 2v1.  But yeah, if I see two ranged or melees duking it out, I might wait to see how it goes.
---
I have never really used addons and i don't plan to use them in classic either. Im going to take my time and level my paladin and have lots of fun.
---
In classic there are so many quests that become memorable if you read the text. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwZhIbiBsI8 This is an example of a quest that i remember really well, and its even cooler when you read it since you kind of feel tricked :P Take your time, enjoy the game :) no rush :) If you want a real vanilla experience, you cant reach 60 in under 27 days. thats how long it took when the game was first released if you were fast :P
---
If only there was a massive network of computers on which people communicate across the world, we could use that to share the information. 
---
Well, counting RL days and counting /played separately can cut out the no-life aspect.
---
Memorizing quest routes is big part of this yes, but so is learning your class well, your rotation and a countless of other things. Like kiting as a warrior, having spirit gear that you equip for mana regen, never being full on either of your resources, always pulling the most amount of mobs you can handle (gets really tricky with a druid, juggling your 3/4 resource bars)
---
I will keep the addons very minimal, or possibly none at all at first. I'll probably level fast at first, as I know Mulgore back to front by now. But I expect to slow down considerably as I get higher. I want to do a lot of dungeon runs. Like, really a lot. I'm sure a druid healer won't be the most popular choice, but . . . 
---
I feel the class you play affect your choice. As a warrior one might incline to help, since warrs rarely have good 1v1 experiences. I also play a support class so I always go in and support, that is just second nature to me.
---
Had you read this subreddit you would've seen that that's not an unpopular choice at all. 
---
I roll on everything I need, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. I'm up for a second run of a dungeon if someone really got unlucky though (in a good group if I have the time).
---
If it looks every matched, let them duke it out. Then pick up the scraps if your guy lost.
---
If your guy is losing, come to the rescue.
---
&gt;If you see a delivery robot driving down the streets why not kick it and smash it and do w/e you feel like doing to it because it's a machine and not a human being so you are morallly allowed (let's not kid ourselves on humanity's worst tendancy's here). 
---
I stopped reading here.  If this is truly how you would act you are what is wrong with society, not blizzard. 
---
I like that idea. I will definitely try it out, at least with an alt. Thanks for the tips and help man! I really had no idea what it actually means.
---
Yeah, no worries! Hope you have a good time!
---
What region is this?
---
PST
---
Always do B, except when let's say I already took a Robe and another one drops with slightly better stats. I just leave it. 
---
One of the most successful casual guilds I was in during TBC era went out of its way to recruit for a social rank.  We wanted players that would contribute to the overall conversation taking place, but also they were encouraged to assist the raiders by harvesting materials for flasks, etc.
---
They were brought along on raids after they were on farm to help their gear, but they came into the guild knowing that they were there as friends/family/casual.
---
I would say this increased the size of the guild by about 30 or so.
---
Welcome to retail wow 
---
Kotick Man Bad.
---
I didn‚Äôt use any add ons or macro‚Äôs until TBC.  I‚Äôll probably do the same for classic

And said internet has clearly existed since the dawn of man. I actually think the Bible says that God created it on the fifth day iirc

Corporate man bad

Rogue talents sure merge best into the same weapon swing. Mages waste maxed ice damage when casting fire and so on.
---
Thank you for not using the Drake template. 
---
A druid playing as feral with swiftmend and fast, cheaper crit regrowths would improve their survivability by tons. I don't see them ever casting a starfire or wrath in that configuration though.
---
&gt; All raids retuned so it's mathematically impossible to beat the end boss without gearing up on the earlier bosses.
---
Maybe this is too much but I would love raids re-tuned.
---
The rest - for me change PvE for PvP or RP-PvP and I'm coming. Absolutely awesome that would be.
---
Feel the rhythm!

Feel the rhyme!

Get on up,

it's Guillotine time!

First thing first is that you cannot know how many of these players are ACTUALLY going to hit 60, and at any time decent. A lot of people wish and convince themselves that they are gonna be super good and nolife when they in reality can't.
---
Another thing is, it really really just depend on your guildies and isn't something you can really prepare properly for. I think over recruiting is worse than underrecruiting, because it gives people this idea that they are going to be raiding in your guild, but in reality is benched all the time. 
---
Option A is what I remember from back in the day and it fucking sucked. I remember doing UBRS with masterloot and needing an item early on. Then I needed something later, but the master looter said I couldn‚Äôt because I had already gotten and item and disenchanted it for the group to roll on. Never again, Option B always

It's a fun meme but what he said wasn't actually incorrect.. On the demo will of forsaken actually worked on polymorph and he said it in context of the tournament on it, where it was fair game to use.
---
But hey I don't like the guy either, lets just blindly hate on him!
---
Sounds cool, which part if the EU are you from?
---
"you could tell I needed help that time". Then everyone clapped. 
---
yea cause I proved you don't know what ur talking about, ill say this, in a situation where threat is the number 1 priority and axe will not be your first choice for a weapon, alcors, tf, if are all better options than +5 weapon skill using an axe.  5% more hit points is very significant as any serious tank but I wouldn't expect you to understand this since you clearly don't know much about vanilla tanking.
---
rip Iwata
---
epic. now what website back in 2004 gave you this information? 
---
Because I can tell you right now that Bradygames Guides were WAY more in-depth than websites were back then.   
---
Also back then the idea of having an online walkthrough or guide didnt exist. Things like thottbot were just catalogs of data received from player addons. And didnt track things like a monsters abilities (the bradygames bestiary guide does). I remember having a bradygames guide for FF7 and Pokemon Emerald/Firered.   
---
If you could find lil' ol me an online guide to these games that also told me everything about every zone, every item, every monster. id be impressed.  
---
Obviously these things exist now. But they didnt back then. And this is why paper game guides have really seized to exist today. 
---
Actually this is one of the rare cases of "content" on this sub where I think video format is the best solution. Certainly better than a 10min engineering videoguide.

Faction? Which country are you recruiting from / languages?

This is only time I would pass on an upgrade in a pug group is if, by rolling on the second piece of gear, it would completely replace the first piece I got earlier. Can't say that scenario happens very often though.
---
Why? He's doing his job.
---
There will be no BGs at launch.
---
oh, good point! gear also isn't restricted to class as much, a warrior might do better with that leather piece for dps, a paladin might need that cloth for healing, ect. be prepared for that. they're (usually) not assholes, its just how vanilla works
---
Classic wow sub reddit is a circle jerk echo chamber ? No!!! Who would‚Äôve thought it?! The horror! 
---
Quite good. I like the idea and the quiz was actually good.
---
Though I would say the difficulty of the questions were kinda random. Some questions like gadgetzan door, thousand needles rocket, ragnaros were REALLY easy, but something like vaelstraz and the aq20 bug thing is something next to none knows(prolly everyone guessed this one). 
---
I didn't really like the sound part that much, well because I don't play with sound. But other than that really this is some of the better vanilla quizes i've seen. 
---
nintendo understands, look blizz this is how you get people to lub you as a company. 
---
Let's not pretend that Nintendo doesn't [layoff workers](https://kotaku.com/nintendo-of-europe-will-lay-off-320-people-this-month-1627924242)
---
It worked fine, guild leader once said it was a test to see if someone is a retard/ninja. Better to lose some loot then deal with assholes. 
---
I will probably mix it. Speed leveling as much as possible to lvl 30, slow down between 30 and 40 and focus on skilling up professions, dungeons runs for gear between 40 and 50, farming gold and ignore most quests between 50 and 60, basically killing stuff for both level and gold.
---
Bruh we aren't talking about 2004. OP says this is being used today. So today, I don't understand the use of paper guides. In 2004 I winged it. 
---
Alcor's Sunrazor was only used for tanking on Nostalrius because of an error in the rage generation formula, which was corrected in late 2015.
---
Stop.
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
That is 2 global cooldowns, scatter is instant, there is no time to cast taunt unless hunter is slow/shook up or just bad. In duels I would spam scatter as countdown was going down and in world pvp with andrenaline running, a warrior would have trouble doing a charge&gt;Tab&gt;Taunt&gt;Tab back and also hunter would have to suck to let it happen. 
---
Dude it's world pvp. There is no "fair". There's only alive or dead. If you want fair go play some duels in front of your main city. 
---
A second monitor with a browser open? What year is this. 2019?

Every successful business does once in a while. It is unrealistic to think that business don't have to reshape or reform once in a while. Is it shitty that people lose jobs? Yes, but that's how business works. There are better ways to lay off employees but let's not sit here and act like this is crazy.
---
FWIW I have no allegiance to either side of this employment event, people just don't seem to understand how the business cycle works.
---
This is it. The most ignorant, brain dead, low effort, hyperjerking shitpost ever. Congratulations
---
Realistically? Really close to yours. Low-is pop-cap, RP-PvP, slow PvE progression (I want to take time leveling to 60 and don't want everyone to have T3 when I get there)
---
&gt;Why are all these videos telling you to download these addons that remove the flavor from classic?
---
Short answer? That's **YOUR** flavor. I don't give a shit about leveling, my game starts at 60. Other people like different things than you
---
So did the Gestapo. 
---
Agreed. The more I need now the less I'll need later. You can get your stuff then.
---
It's been talked to death already.
---
Blizzard has 3 options:
---
a) Re-re-release classic for FRESsssSHH experience. This is bad because they want people's characters to matter.
---
b) release new content. This requires lots of works, and is a gamble because the community might not like it.
---
c) release tbc. This requires zero work, and there's already a stable fanbase of TBC players that loves the expansion.
---
Wonder what they will choose...
---
I plan on skulking around Duskwood. The atmosphere is perfect for an undead.
---
I don¬¥t know if I have it in me to look up wowhead every time I need a location for some fetch and kill quest. Not talking about that arrow that navigates you like a robot but some help is not off the table. 
---
There are many encounters where fear is not a mechanic at all, especially in the later tiers. In all of those encounters the slightly higher throughput of humans will be preferred. 
---
While the human spirit does not represent the same increase in expected success fear ward does on fights where fear is present, it does mean you can run with fewer healers or with more power infusions. Letting you split clear or clear faster.
---
There's a valid min-max reason to prefer humans on some fights, even if don't agree that in total humans will provide more average benefit after a certain number of dwarves. Night elves on the other hand...
---
You would totally PvP.
---
I let them fight until it looks like my boy is going to die and then I step in. If he's winning do nothing - it's so much worse for the enemy to lose that 1v1 knowing that a dude didn't even step in.
---
Gotta use psychological warfare. 
---
I don‚Äôt care about fair, I want my fair kill. Don‚Äôt jump in and help me if I‚Äôm fighting some scum 1 on 1. Getting jumped 2v1 doesn‚Äôt bother me, I get bothered when someone jumps in when they think I need help, I‚Äôd rather die alone lol. 
---
Private server launches are 5-15x more crowded than nonsharded retail launches.
---
Wait it out until the last second.
---
If the same faction wins, heal him up (hubrid class or first aid)
---
If he is about to lose, Intervene WWF Style and lay the smackdown.
---
well when I used to have 256kb download speed. It was often a lot quicker to just look at a paper guide than to wait 5 minutes for one page to load.
---
Hey just checked out the subreddit and discord and im definitely interested (really like the dkp system you guys are using.) Im wondering what your policy will be regarding hand of rag. I plan on playing resto shaman in raids but I want to accumulate hand of rag and enh gear over time (as im sure many other shamans want.) Just wondering how you guys plan on handling that. Will the first drop be a loot council roll? Or will it be a dkp thing since its more of a pvp item? Also aiming to be mining/bs to be able to craft the hammer myself. 
---
Have you never heard of a voice recording before?
---
Keep ignoring points, going for the speed fallacy. TF/IF were brought as proof that better procs (compared to measly fire dmg from alcor) for threat are there and using lower speeds is an option and it is better in most cases. But part of it is due to human racial +wskills. 
---
But the same happens with the strong axes available in orc's case. The only case where Alcor's gets better (aside from the one fight I mentioned) is when lacking hit due to reducing the threatless window on a miss but glancing blows are still there hitting hard, unlike when you're using an axe which the +skill make smoother. And I don't expect a mugger's belt or you smuggling ACLG from a dagger rogue. 
---
Tho ONLY point for 1.3s are full-time HStrike spams due to the flat threat added by each on top of the one brought by the damage itself.  
---
And well, you're reducing defensive stats... this includes health/stamina. So the 5% is also reduced. Not to say this bonus is around 500-700 in BiS depending on how buffed you are. The flask alone is more. 
---
This.

#DO YOU SMELLLLLELELELELELLELE, WHAT THE CHAIN LIGHTNING IS COOKING?!
---
Very nice what you just wrote. Yes, I really do like to play SM/Ruin instead of SL, because SL is kinda boring imo. However, I just cant stand to get globaled down while getting stunlocked and having no way to get out. Warlocks lack mobillity so much.. Its a shame.. even tho I am def going to play on the horde side and Orc, its still feels weak vs rogues and warriors who will train you in a BG and having no way to escape.  
---
Do rogues use their high warlord gear or do they really just play with their pve set? (5 pieces of tier 1 for 10 extra energy for example)   
---
I really like the playstyle of chasing the FC and defending the room as a rogue tho.  
---
I like the rogue because it also has a very nice pve rotation and can top the meters. Mages aswell, but their rotation is very boring with just spamming frostbolt.. Hunter has a nice rotation aswell, but their dps is very bad around AQ and Naxx, so its not very motivating for me to play one,  but in PVP they are a lot of fun tho.. Lock has everything I look for in the class fantasy design.. just the mobility and bad escapes makes me think twice before rolling one.  
---
Its so hard to make a desicion based on all this. meh
---
Yeah I was searching for someone to mention this. Just wanted to say the slow scroll quest text is so annoying for me. I have no idea how some people can play with that turned on.
---
Thank you, I saw that one yes. Very helpful
---
On our server then we had some kind of gentlemen agreement. Yet there were epic battles down there many times. I was 30 and had high end gildies who gladly came to help.
---
&gt;  *I think over recruiting is worse than underrecruiting, because it gives people this idea that they are going to be raiding in your guild, but in reality is benched all the time.* 
---
I agree. I always ensure that there is a guild rank that specifies your status. Along the lines of Raider, Substitute Raider. Not being clear is one the fastest ways to drama. 
---
^This
---
World PvP in vanilla is inherently completely unfair.  At least one side was likely not excepting to get jumped.  This isn't a duel where both parties know what to expect.
---
The Golden Rule of "Talk shit get hit" is in full affect.
---
Red = Dead
---
By the time BWL is on farm all Priests spec 31 points into Discipline anyway. Holy is only a necessity when you're undergeared.
---
You walk toward your destination in between shots to save travel time.
---
So were the Nazis. 
---
Why does it have to be either "Take your time without addons" or "Addons = Gotta go fast"?
---
I will be using addons for things like quests, and will obviously use damage/threat meters. But i've never been a speedy leveller.
---
If this book is actually useful I'll dildo my shitter. 
---
&gt; "as possible" can be interpreted any number of ways, meaning it gives them whatever leeway they whish for to create their version of vanilla
---
Omg, wow, it's like you just got here.
---
Yeah, duh. This is what the past few years of private server debate‚Äîand now r/classicwow‚Äîhas been about. Newsflash: Without changes, you actually end up with a non-Blizzlike game.
---
Because it's not 2004 and because the gaming landscape / community has changed so much, it turns out that you actually can't have the actual original thing *ever*.
---
So now it's about making smart choices to get back to the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of what Vanilla was like.
---
Caught up now?
---
For classic, there won't be pvp rewards out of the gate -- however I still will follow that exact statement of red= dead.  
---
&gt; thats not fair its war!
---
"All's fair in love and war"
---
PVP happens, the only honor that matters is what I gain from killing. 
---
I'm 99% sure their schedule is not the final one, but more a rough guide, or at least I hope so..
---
It's Alliance, Europe, English language (first line in post :).
---
Yeah I'll really miss his bi monthly posts on the forums.....
---
Everyone has a different approach. Some like taking their time and enjoy leveling, some want to be max asap. Some want to mess with wPvP early on, some try to avoid it. There's RPers and min-maxers.
---
In my case I'll just take it easy and enjoy it while keeping a light bunch of addons, mostly profession or dungeon/loot based ones. Well, and heavy macroing since I'll be needing it to wreck with my hunter.  
---
That is pretty messed up of that group and the master looter. Definitely not what I had in mind with option A
---
Hell he can have his whole guild hiding they all can get it one by one. I‚Äôm all for the Red is dead no doubt. I‚Äôm just saying if I see a fellow horde in an even fight in the wild, I‚Äôm not stepping in. I wanna see my fellow faction mates prosper not get carried by gankers. 
---
Seemingly daily reminder that they laid off non developers and even have loads of developer positions they want to fill.

WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WHIRLWIND BOMB OUTTA NOWHERE!!!!
---
I always did in vanilla. I had two 60s and several alts. I don‚Äôt play private servers. 
---
Me and my friends did!
---
Oh yeah sure, if he's winning, let him finish the job.
---
If he's about to lose, step in and lay the smack down. You might need him alive if another 2 alliance witness the tail end of that fight.
---
Ythisen is a hypocritical dickhead that has this entire sub fouled. 
---
99% of the quests in vanilla are a horribly generic and a boring variant of go kill X of Y, gather Z, or gather Z by killing Y.  There's really not much depth there.
---
If they're the same level as me you betcha I'm joining in.
---
In classic wow, watch
---
In retail, finish my ‚Äúkill 10 players‚Äù quest
---
tell me what axe is better threat weapon then? we are comparing orc to tauren racials only.  When u use TF/if or alcors, orc racial does nothing.  Im not saying +5 weapon skill is bad, but +5 axe skill does nothing considering the weapon choices u have as a tank. 5% hp is the best and only option if you want to be a dedicated horde tank
---
I think the people who are posting the memes are the oned who get karma. 
---
lower defense = more  rage, good luck rage dumping with a 2.9 speed axe.

You Stop. :)

Mal\`Ganis was one of the original CST launch servers.  Quite a few in southeastern Wisconsin rolled on this server
---
Sanctuary still gives a total reduction in damage, so it doesnt matter if the tank is DWing
---
FD to eat and drink instead of bandaging is useful on some fights like lotheb, so it has some use, but yeah never just to drink and there are few if any fights where a mana pot or 2 and maybe a rune wouldn't keep you going.
---
I used to take shits to Nintendo power 
---
I'm not, I'm referring to Nuremburg and "just following orders". That doesnt absolve you of shittu behavior.
---
Would you recommend tailoring at all for warlocks? I keep hearing the bloodvine set is GREAT but if classic launches at 1.12 and there are upgrades from bloodvine already, there may not be a point? I am in a similar boat for really wanting engineering for pvp, but don't want to gimp myself for money or pve.
---
Sorry, but if "ruining the industry you're supposedly a part of" is part of a CEO's job description, then we need to remove all CEO positions from every single industry.
---
Because people like Robert Cocktick are ruining gaming. They're setting the precedent that you can have literally the most money you've ever had, and still "need" to lay off employees... In EVERY culture, that is known as an Ultra Dick Move.
---
I am sorry but Instant Quest Text is a must let me tell you why. There are times where you only have a small window of opportunity to accept/complete a quest before you get killed, it could be drowning, mobs, or the opposite faction.
---
As for add-ons get what you want it really doesn't seem to affect how I feel about the game. I even like Questie in pserv I don't need it for the directional aspect but I like it for the fact that it helps me remember obscure quests so I don't forget to grab them.
---
See but my viewpoint is I might let him lose either way, who‚Äôs to say this asshole getting beat by the other faction doesn‚Äôt have a character on that side of the flag as well? Maybe it‚Äôll be different when we go back to classic since you can‚Äôt have opposing factions on same server but in today‚Äôs WoW I‚Äôm letting him live or die by his own sword lol. 
---
/W help?
---
I would take deterrence over 5/5 survivalist, it is a great tool for waiting out your scatter and trap cooldowns against melee. Also entrapment (while terrible in pve) is probably better than improved wing clip in pvp. Just don't drop it in raids or at least make sure your healers know not to stand in the traps if you do.

Looking forward to the bi yearly updates now.

That's maybe true in early MC and possibly in t2 gear depending on which itemization blizzard goes with. But once you have ZG enchants its often harder to be under hit cap than over it. Even early on if you have a hit scope it can be hard to find any upgrades to your other +hit pieces.

WoW Classic won't be progression will it? Or do we not know? I know they said something about releasing at 1.12, but maybe that will just be the patch for balance sake and still release content progressively.
---
I'm wondering if wow classic will change these profession priorities at all. I defintiely want engineering maxed, but don't want to gimp myself in terms of gold and pve progression
---
Gut them, camp them, make them call in their guildies who camp you, you call in your guildies. Southshore fun in the sun.

This was savage xD Nintendo really hit every other publisher that fires people for "restructuring" hard 
---
This happens everywhere. The problem is that it creates a cycle where you have to keep ‚Äúbeating‚Äù on your earnings as a company so your stock price stays afloat. You can fudge the numbers for a little bit and make it look like your company is doing great but it catches up quickly. In order for their next quarter report or EOY report to beat the previous year... they figured they had to cut all those employees.  Companies that do this can‚Äôt last that long...
---
&gt;Lol I've never understood paper game guides. Downvote me to oblivion but I just don't get it.
---
Murloc pr0n?
---
There are examples but generally, no, I wouldn't expect it.
---
It depends on my mood. 
---
Here‚Äôs my take on it. I also believe this is why retail is the way it is.
---
Generally people will seek simpler, faster or most convenient results. Especially in terms of effort. Shortcuts are regarded as good or desired. It 
---
"Everyone does it" is the laziest justification ever.
---
People are getting fed up with the unsustainable beast that is unregulated free market capitalism.
---
We desperately need capitalism reform in this country.

That‚Äôs the game. It‚Äôs a harsh world and it‚Äôs not fair.

Hook a brother up with a frostsaber? ;)
---
Nef axe is threat machine for starters
---
* A cap of 3-5k players, with a good portion of that logging on daily. 
---
* A decent mix between Horde and Ally, though I prefer more allies than horde by a narrow margin, maybe 60:40 of 55:45 favoring ally
---
* The biggest thing I care about is a good pug community. Since I will be doing a Hybrid class(Feral/resto Druid) I will not be specced for hardcore raiding. The only way I will step into a raid is likely in a PUG either run by myself or a friend who doesn't care about my less than optimal build. I wouldn't mind seeing GDKP runs become a thing, though who knows if that will happen
---
* Good PvP community. Hopefully a good pug PvP community, I don't want it to dissolve into "Be in a premade or don't bother PvPing"
---
* Look If loot trading is going to be forced into the game then I want it to go one step further, that only lets people roll Need on an item they could actually use. I don't want to see a Mage, Rogue, and a priest rolling on a shield or 2h weapon for their warrior friend. or cloth wearing being able to need plate. 
---
* I don't mind sharding for the first zones, and MAYBE for the 2nd zones for a few months after release. There are going to be tons and tons of tourists who will play Classic just because it's included in their sub. Most of these tourist likely will not level past 20 imo. 
---
Why would you put a dildo in your toilet......oh nvm. I'll just leave you be then. 
---
Yup - but unless you are running with a stealthed cat then you dont really get the full effect of being invisible and it only gives you the opener. Once in combat, stoneform allows you to drop things that really turn the tide of a fight and come back from a losing situation, rather than just a "win-more" racial like shadowmeld, if that makes sense. Stoneform lets you drop rogue crippling poison, blind, other hunters viper sting, etc - things that generally would make you actually lose a fight vs a good opponent. The "win-more" term is common in the game industry but generally it refers to things that dont really help you completely reverse a bad situation but rather just help you get the opener you might have gotten anyways by good positioning, that kind of thing. Thats my understanding of it anyways haha
---
It's not justification it's reality.
---
Yeah I had a nice little raiding guild but at the behest of one of my more over achiever officers we decided that backups were a good idea in case a few people couldnt make it but the problem is backups dont want to be backups and the more people we brought in the more drama ensued to the point our core members started leaving and then we were left pugging and once we missed a few raid days I got fed up and decided to try Age Of Conan for a month.                   
---
                 
---
Came back 3 weeks later to find the guy I left in charge bounced and handed GM to some random new person who used the guild as his personal bank, I was super pissed the guy liquidated the guild but it was my fault for leaving so I went back to finish out my AOC week and I was going back to sea duty anyways. 6 months later I returned and a ton of my friends changed servers and before Real ID so i've never seen them again, I've been bouncing from one guild to the next never finding many people I can call friends and never a place to call home and now since guilds are basically pointless in retail I'd lost hope of ever catching that magic feeling that was WoW but with Classic I think it's my 2nd shot.              
---
            
---
Anyways recruit until you can comfortably do raids, better to miss a raid day then have your guild torn apart with drama.
---
An oceanic server, PvE.
---
- Good night time population with pugs always running 5 mans and ubrs.
---
- world chat that doesn‚Äôt descend into politics/gender theory/etc (this shit triggers me on pservers)
---
- 4-5k concurrent player cap (if oceanic could fill a PvE server long term like this, I‚Äôd be stoked). 
---
- more broken down release gates (full patch releases would be fine but I don‚Äôt really care if Mara and DM are in at launch). 
---
I‚Äôm trying to think of more but honestly it‚Äôs all the obvious stuff like no sharding etc. 
---
Prima guides too.
---
I am in chicago and I do plan to play. who knows what the servers will look like
---
Hah you reminded me of one of the few banes of my existence in Vanilla - dishonourable kills. A permanent mark on your record that would make me not want to join raids on capital cities, etc.
---
LOL absolutely not.
---
retail is a better option to bridge the gap with 'fair play' if that's what you want. you can get ganked in BFA by someone 20+ levels higher and still win the fight now.
---
classic is the opposite, thankfully
---
Unchecked gaming monopolies, buying out any game created by people who care about the product they produce, not what kind of crap they can paint on their mobile cash grab 'games'. If only there were laws to prevent this...
---
I mean we don't know what the classic rage formula will be, but on popular servers right now having enough spare rage that the speed of your weapon is holding you back from dumping rage then you are probably prioritizing your skills wrong (on any fight that isn't vael, and maybe firemaw and saph)
---
Please do define ‚Äúskill‚Äù

Who will do the trust busting when the politicians themselves are getting paid? Legalized bribery (lobbying) is one of the biggest flaws in the US government.

If u dont like world pvp you have to roll a PvE server otherwise u will hate the leveling

What's your opinion on the situation then?
---
Depends entirely on what itemization Blizzard chooses, doesn't it.
---
Dude suck it up life is not fair
---
Twice or three times at most.
---
the guy made a single comment saying he thought he was somewhere else. you took it to mean something it didn't and got really upset. you should not have gotten upset about anything dude he wasn't insulting you. that's why you're getting downvoted
---
Free market capitalism is the cure to big corporations not the cause. It is the very regulations that you crave that breeds these publicly traded mega corporations with million dollar CEOs. But in the rules it says no politics so meh.
---
To be fair, Nintendo has been a powerhouse in gaming for 40 years now. Maybe something about their business philosophy has lead to them to out survive much of their fallen competition?  
---
Actually it's the other way around. The internet created God.  
---
like others are saying, yeah, you should play the game like you want, and to answer your question about why you're seeing so much min/maxing, looking at guides is probably more common among people who are trying to optimize their strategies, while the type of content you're looking at is probably less interesting to someone just exploring the world

To be fair though, even back before my family owned a computer, I couldn't stand flipping through the damn book. Drove me nuts.

I just played everything blind instead. If me or people around me couldn't figure something out in a game, I just stopped playing for awhile and came back to it.  
---
Yeah the immensely high Japanese suicide rate due to employees feeling worthless if they don‚Äôt work 95 hours a week. 
---
How we handled "backups" was to assign them weeks. X spots in the raids are open to backups, week 1 is for Abackup, week 2 is for Bbackup. etc. If they miss their week then not my fault and we fill in with extra backup. Having too many raiders is a good problem but requires being sensitive to their desire for gear. At some point they were able to schedule themselves for the most part and everyone was happy.
---
Only for T2 gear. Pre bis, T1 and T3 all have plenty of hit at any itemization. 
---
"the only way to put out this fire is to keep spraying it with lighter fluid!"

Which is pretty much what he's saying.

Its 2019, you don't need an excuse, just slide it in. Its fine. Accept your kinks and yourself.

I haven't heard of this, got a source?

oh you are misremembering. dailies in all their glory were introduced with TBC:
---
* netherwing dailies
---
* skettis (shatari skyguard) dailies
---
* quel danas (sunreaver onslaught) dailies
---
* ogri'la dailies &amp; apex shards
---
* WANTED dungeon (normal &amp; heroes) dailies
---
* call to arms instanced pvp dailies introduced in tbc
---
* zone-specific pvp dailies introduced in tbc (although the watchtowers with zone-wide buffs were iirc introduced with the classic naxx patch)
---
* profession dailies
---
dailies didn't really change much until they introduced world quests
---
I am Spartacus!
---
learn to gear for threat and u will have more rage to spam heroic, it obviously doesn't apply to most players since majority of people will not be playing at this level but to say orc is the best tank over tauren just because u want to prioritize using an Axe  for +5 skill over better items that are not axes is just incorrect.  the 5% hp boost tauren gives makes it the best tank hands down
---
Soon(‚Ñ¢)
---
Aside from the tons of people who are misreading your post as you complaining, I don't expect anyone to be fair in wPVP. That's why wPVP is so fun.  
---
When I see a higher level roaming through my leveling zone, I know I am at his mercy completely. I just mind my own business and hope to the sky that he doesn't dismount. As soon as he does, I give it my all, knowing full well I'm dead.  
---
That said, I have my own *personal* code that I follow. I don't attack people who are in combat with mobs. I don't attack anyone who isn't in the "yellow" level range. I will even help enemy faction if they're struggling with a mob. And the number one sacred rule is to respect the 1v1. If there is a 1v1, fair level battle going on in wPVP, I stop and observe. After that I clap for the winner and either ride away or wait for full hp/mp and attack him myself depending on how I feel.  
---
this is accurate
---
Seriously fuck this sub 99% of the time. 
---
So why am i still subscribed? Because its easy to just ignore a lot of these posts and i sometimes want to read that one interesting post. I domt visit any other classic wow news outlets.
---
Not confirmed?

Then we allowed them to buy their own stock in the 80s with Reagan, then we gave them massive tax cuts under Trump, permanently

Hey, maybe politics DOES matter?! It would be nice if we stopped incentiving CEOs to destroy industries for short term profits
---
Maybe not corpse camping in the game.  I mean, Jesus came back before because the Romans weren‚Äôt there to corpse camp.
---
Did you just compare Kotick to Jesus?
---
Resto shaman isn‚Äôt a great pvp spec, but if you‚Äôre just talking pub BGs just having healers is often enough to get many wins you wouldn‚Äôt normally get. Don‚Äôt expect to get spots in the top premades though. For just random world pvp lock+Healer is going to very strong.
---
I think if someone comes in here and says "X class is going to be better with a shaman" but you don't want to play that class as much as you want to play warlock, then you're doing yourself a disservice by switching.  
---
I think no matter if there is *any* negative feedback about these two grouping up for PVP, you should stick with the class you want to play.  
---
You'll do better playing a sub-optimal group of classes you want to play, than you would playing an optimal group of classes you don't want to play.  
---
Now to be fair, this comp would be fine. You could mess with lock/resto or lock/elemental and have a lot of fun. With lock/elemental, it's an interesting set up because either one of those classes left to freecast is going to be a pain for the enemy. Another interesting component is ankh + soulstone.  
---
Shaman anti poison would help you a lot with rogues, and frost shock + earthbind would help you a lot with warriors.  
---
There's more to be said about the comp, but I am willing to say it's a fine comp. Your shaman will have to be really good though at support.  
---
Once you can automation a position, you're just waisting money if you keep employing someone in that position. Eventually technology will replace a role, and a company no longer needs the workers.

If there were a book with HP values, armor values, spawn locations, and loot tables, I'd buy it instantly. More like a tome.

Hey guys. Obviously people have been floating around the idea of post Naxx content for some time now. Mainly Kara as its the biggest no brainer. Just wondering how ya'll felt about some of the other missed opportunities from back in the day, and seeing i made a video on it figured i'd post it here.
---
Im a big "no changes" guys fyi, just keep in mind the original content cycle is complete after Naxx. So imo expanding Classic's longevity in this way both circumvents infringing on the original Vanilla experience, while also exploring underutilized areas from back in the day. 
---
What do you mean by that?

I'm still holding onto my bet that it's April

**&lt;Pertento&gt;** 
---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE** ***with a social atmosphere***
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‚Äòsemi-hardcore‚Äô guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‚Äòoff-spec‚Äô. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, **we may also try to vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.

---
Xp locking was added in wrath but I really hope it's added to vanilla because I want to be able to kill higher level "raid" mobs with other twinks.
---
this is legit the only answer that makes sense but id argue its not worth it to go orc just for this one axe
---
Alright so I'm a guy who rushes to 60 and I have to say I think quests in vanilla are far better than later quests. There might only be the 1% good quests, but that 1% kicks the hell out of the quests in later expansions.  
---
This was from the same year that the CEO took a massive pay cut wasn‚Äôt it?

Oh god, dont' let Xanthak on Classic Discussion forums see this. He'll be triggered beyond repair at "Get gud"  
---
What about ele/resto mix? I believe I saw some healing raids and do bursts in pvp with it
---
Agree to disagree I guess, but taurens aren't even in the running for best tank. You can make a good argument for trolls and orcs, and even undead have their uses, but 5% health doesn't do anything for your threat no matter how you gear. And at the end of the day tps is the only stat the matters for a vanilla tank.
---
A. Building a good reputation was a thing. As a dps it‚Äôs nice to be known as one of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù guys.
---
April first /cry
---
It doesn't really matter. The vast majority of PvP players don't attack enemy on sight - it just slows your levelling down so much you'd never actually get to 60. Most players will only kill/camp players that first kill them for no reason. Because of this, anyone who spends time killing others for no reason find themselves being killed and camped 10x more than anyone else.  
---
It's not necessarily a good/bad thing, just the way it is. There is a natural sort of karma system. If you kill someone for no reason they will probably tell their party, general and guild about it and then you'll see them again in a week when they're higher level than you and they will kill you twice.  
---
But yeah, world pvp is not about /dueling - it's about attacking someone when you think you can win. Only an idiot attacks someone when they're not sure they can win.
---
Naw if anything it would be the gang becomes who every the guy who made fable is. 
---
Give the green a heal and the red a dot and be on my way
---
Dictionary definition: the ability to do something well; expertise.
---
My definition: The ability to react, anticipate, and adapt to dynamic situations occurring in some predefined setting.
---
What falls under skill: pvp, most definitely.  tanking and healing in raids, and doing it well.  I will also say some solo pve, such as elite mob kiting and being able to juggle multiple mobs.
---
What doesn't fall under skill? Memorizing quest objectives and compiling or following a static point A to point B list of directions that will get you there the "fastest".  And as I say, luck as well, as in, being lucky enough to get a quest drop you need right off the bat, or parrying a final blow from a mob that would have killed you just before landing the killing blow yourself, saving 5 minutes of corpse running.
---
Healing shamans are pretty awful but yea if u are just gonna Pub bg and random world pvp ganking your classes wont matter mutch
---
Dual wielding/fury tanks with world buffs are capable of reaching the buff limit and won't want sanctuary because the damage reduction is negligible and not worth a buff slot for them. (at least for private servers, let's see if there's a buff cap for classic)
---
Buffing sanctuary is a very edge case and can be done with the 30/21 spec but it isn't really high priority nor should/can it always be done.
---
I'm literally taking as much time as I like. Rushing is going to ruin and burn the games content away and restrict me from fully experiencing the community aspect.
---
Dude completely slaughtered that. I was going to help you and correct some mistakes but I lost all interest after the fifth one just in the first frame alone. Still have no idea what I read, however given the context I'm going to guess it's Blizz is the bad guy for firing 800 people and Nintendo is the good guy for taking a paycut. I've heard it so many times already I don't even need to read the text. If you're so upset, stop playing. Seriously that's all it takes. Running around the internet like a bully, stomping your feet and crying about how other people run their business is really childish. Since I don't share the vocal majority, go ahead and proceed with the downvotes. My internet feelings are crushed, I don't know what I'll do with myself after losing all my fake internet points.
---
Great Evil? Jesus?

what monopoly does Blizzard have exactly?
---
I know what you're trying to say and, if the original team who developed vanilla were in charge of creating such content I may even be on board. Sadly I don't trust the new crew with Activision in command.
---
Dodgykebaab actually posted a pretty good video based on cut content and data mining showing his hypothesis of what the original content was meant to be before TBC was selected. I do believe this is probably close to the original intent and it would have been glorious.

good luck generating threat when ur dead :P

Are you for real? Have you bothered with checking what that sub is? Of course you haven't, so don't tell what his comment means. So many times when people say something bad about the current WoW, or how let's say Wotlk was good as how I did, there's someone like that guy with exactly the same comment. That's what made me "upset", altough I don't know why you assume that.
---
Also where did I ask about why am I getting downvoted?
---
Becauae they werent in 1.12
---
the only reason u see orcs tank is because people like to pvp and/or go dps warrior but then change their mind or are forced to become tanks and stick with orc.  A dedicated tank is tauren and no other.  I don't even need to talk about troll or ud for tanks, don't make me laugh
---
Free markets gave you some pretty clean air. Before free markets you had to burn a fire in your house to keep warm.
---
How didn't I see sooner that this place is an even worse circlejerk than the main sub?

They didn't say anything clearly yet. They said, they will make an announcement, when they have something to say.

I've owned this book since about 2005 and I found it in my attic today along with the Battle Chest. It was a gift from my father. I won't ever get rid of it, as it means a lot to me and I have many fond memories of  using it.
---
I read this book time and time again, flicking through the pages, amazed at how much there was to this game - in which I could endlessly explore an entire world. I was only about 8 years old, but my dad had a computer and he let me play on it whenever I pleased using his account.
---
Not everything you read online is fake, or staged, or misleading. Not everything is negative. You don't have to be a part of the negativity. 
---
Yeah before the EPA our country was a great example of the free market in action
---
I disagree of course they have their issues but its a good representation of what to expect. Better representation than retail. 
---
Don't get me wrong I'm not a huge fan of every quest line having dozens of cut scenes and phasing and junk now.  And I am looking forward to the brain dead questing of basically just grinding with quest bonuses but there's hardly a lot of depth there.

Well met!

LF a stable EU PVP/RP-PVP raiding guild with a lot of experience in leading/organizing. Leaning more towards a german guild, but I would also appreciate an english speaking one to improve my spoken word. On release I plan to take at least one week off of work to level my dwarf hunter. My approach to the game will not be super hardcore but raiding is something I really care about. Call it casual ambitious or a little more than semi-hardcore (2-3 raids/week). I can not take the game super serious anymore since the working life does not allow it. I play the game since beta, raided in classic until bwl (priest/rogue), collected a lot of experience as GM and RL in various addons and leveled a hunter to 60 on a famous pserver. I am also willing to take a specific role in the guild (classlead, dkp, whatever) as long as it is not getting a fulltime job ingame. I had that many times as a RL and atm I can not see that happening. Maybe in an emergency case :D ... anyways... I  garantee for 100% attendance besides on vacation, since I know how difficult it can be to fill up raids or to recruit new good and reliable players. As I know that there will be only 2-3 hunter spots, the only thing I insist on is a guaranteed raidspot. I do not look for a server first guild, but I am definitly in the mindset of a progressive player most of the time. Top 5 on our server would be nice. I do not care about comparison to other realms. Min-maxing is something I often really like but nothing in comparison to my old days. I am kind of bored of it, as I realized in the grand scheme of things, it somehow makes a game less funnier in the long run (gearscore, etc.) So a guild with the reputation of a solid and skilled player base is something I look into, but not in an elitist way anymore. Since I am not getting any younger the social factor in a guild is more important to me than the hassle to get all raid consumables all the time to top some logs nobody cares about (especially as a hunter).
---
I am already working on personal spreadsheet for my journey in classic. And yes, I will be an engineer. Hit me up, If you liked what you read and I got ya attention. Cheers!
---
You could play a resto Druid with the feral/resto hybrid spec. (0/31/20 or 0/30/21) I can‚Äôt remember exactly, but that lets you do a lot as a Druid and you can stay that spec until BWL+ raiding. So if you just care about wpvp, forever.
---
However you would be the bulk of the damage, which with two healer hybrids wouldn‚Äôt be all that great compared to if one of you went pure dps. But you could tank heal or dps with gear swaps. And the two of you would be very hard to kill. And battle res+reincarnate+innervate sounds cool. Play what your heart desires there‚Äôs always cool advantages.
---
STOP THE GANK! THAT PALADIN HAS A FAMILY!
---
BAH GOD HE GLOBAL'D HIM! 
---
Lol when in doubt blame the "rich people." A tale old as time.
---
If you have units in an RTS that aren't doing anything and you're losing resources by having them exist, you delete those units.
---
The same principle works here.
---
I'm a class gear officer in a Naxx progressed guild on pserver and have to say that these lists are of limited use for Classic.
---
All the servers these refer to had progressive itemization. Items received buffs, new items were added to loot tables, etc.
---
All evidence so far suggests that Classic will release with the final balanced versions of all items. This drastically changes the "stage 1" prebis lists.
---
Also, depending on which items are available during release (blues and greens), prebis lists will be changed *significantly*.
---
For instance, for Warlocks and SPriests, if "of Shadow Wrath" greens are out during launch, that changes their prebis and even bis lists (for stage 1).
---
Other things like DM items, like Blade of the New Moon which is lock prebis are different than those lists, since they assume (ironically) blizzlike progression whereas Classic will not have blizzlike progression and instead will have only 4 stages of a huge amount of content lumped together as it currently stands.
---
If you're interested I made a pretty in-depth post on frost mage stat weights on the Nostalrius forums [https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=34186](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=34186).

Alliance faction

We are based in Australia (Sydney/Melb). We will be taking time off work at launch after then returning to work playing on a 6pm-12pmish schedule while trying to keep a balance of life. Weekends times are all day if possible. We are mostly 30+ but we have a few younger members joining us as well.
---
Priority is raiding and Dungeons. PVP is secondary but still promoted. We will be using EPGP as our loot distribution system (Not fully set it stone yet) and we will not be letting anyone just over-ride gear calls except to the main tank or unless there is some serious reason to otherwise.
---
Anyone can apply - more the merrier just PM me on reddit and I can send you the discord info. This includes those outside of Australia who play in the same time zone. Feel free to bring in friends we don't have a limit on numbers.

Another industry will eventually take its place. Look at just 50 years ago, we had millions of people working down the mines or in the steel industry. All of this is automated now, and new industries such as software development have popped up.
---
The layoffs have been in customer support roles mainly, which are becoming automated for the majority of cases for their games. For example the authenticator has protected accounts much better so they don't need people to help recover accounts, and you can also restore items via the website now. If they staff aren't needed it's silly to just keep them on. New industries will open, and roles with be there, although eventually yes, automation will take over a lot of roles. At that point no one really knows what will happen, universal basic income is one of the things being discussed, as is taxing companies based on the amount of automation they have 
---
Oh, please explain to me then how firing 800 people after having the most profitable year ever is a good thing, i'll wait.

Bro that Stormwind quest that spans like 15 levels is legit.

I forget what it's called but Derpsout did a video on it and it's like the 1 thing I agree with him about.

Activision Blizzard is 4 billions in debt. They can't afford gms.

Knowing blizzard it will be on like September 21st, that last "official" day of summer.

People who do are best suited to PvE servers, tbh.
---
no it‚Äôs not. 
---
I noticed that potioning became BM over the years. Vanilla it was expected, than in WotLK it suddenly became bad manners to pop a potion in battle.
---
I think it has something to do with how casual Wrath became.
---
No you don't, you send them in to attack someone. 
---
Found Bobby Koticks Yes-Man.
---
Yeah, except this is real life and not a fucking video game. So this "same principle" does not work here. Sorry. These are actual people and not pixels on a screen. They have lives and families and you signed a contract to work with them and not fuck them over because you're not making all the money in the world.
---
Do not try to justify this shitty, irredeemable behavior. It makes you look like a corporate worshiping retard.
---
I'm hoping within the next couple weeks. I just need to know when so I can schedule 2 weeks off.
---
I know people who picked night elf purely for the reason you moved faster as a wisp when dead 
---
Just watch your threat addon and its fine.
---
I do see what you mean. You're thinking which class would dominate the "regular" classes most if they had unlimited talents. To me it seems more natural to compare each class if they all hypothetically were able to fill all trees. Which one would then be the strongest.
---
I usually just install add-on's 'as needed' and try to keep my game/char as clean and simple as possible.
---
I'll also be taking a long time on my first character, keeping all my skills up to level.  Fishing, first aid, trade/gathering skills etc will all be progressing with my character level.
---
I'm in no rush.  Vanilla for life.
---
Do you think corporations are looking to polute the environment? What does this have to do with Activision-Blizzard prioritizing short term shareholder profit over the longer term strategy of making great games?
---
We're 5+ months away from a release. Joining/making a guild now really has very little to do with what the guild will look like 2 months after release. If you have 50 people signed up you have no real life connection to, I'd be very impressed if 10 of them were still in your guild 2 months after release.

That‚Äôs a funny way to spell lvl 25 Druid.

In group pvp, when talking about Shaman, the answer always is ...
---
... ELEMENTAL SHAMAN.
---
Combining 2 of the most OP end game pvp, area denial-style classes, known to be capable blowing people up instantly? 
---
Umm, ya. It will work.
---
It's a blizzard game sub, of course that was going to be the case. 
---
I can foresee it now... All the corpse camping UD Rogues with "twitchtv" or "ttv" in their names. 
---
Even improved ghostwolf has a 1sec cast time in vanilla, and is counterable.  Also, there is no movement speed reduction suppression in vanilla, so he is still slowed in ghostwolf so it isn't much of a speed boost.  
---
Worse case is the fight starts with him on top of you.  That can hurt, but with nova and blink he shouldn't be able to finish you.  Try to poly reset, if he grounding or ESs the poly just move and use R1 frostbolt to clear the grounding and keep him slowed until he can't stop the poly.  You can use imp CS to preempt the totem or the shock as well.  
---
Off the poly reset to max range, your frost spells have a 16 yard advantage over his shocks so you should be eating him alive at max range with him slowed and you not, even if he ghostwolfs he cant close the distance since you will still be faster.  If something goes wrong, he reflectors or has some other gimmick like a free action potion, just repoly and hard reset again.  There is no arcane reflector.  
---
OP is talking about the announcement of the classic WoW release date.
---
No they weren't.  GMs were not allowed to socialize with the players in any meaningful way.  Each had their own flavor of how to go about the job, but they were expected to follow a basic script.  I don't know anyone who normally talks about the great social benefits of customer service reps.
---
The problem is, if the mods remove all the crap like this we'll be left with 1 or 2 posts a day, if that, then everyone will think it's a dead sub and leave. 
---
As much as I hate it, having crap like this makes the sub more active and keeps it alive. 
---
You can follow a quest guide and it's way less boring and faster at some points. A mix of the two is probably the fastest.

It makes the shareholders and executives more money.

Hi, /u/primus_suckss

Interesting. Played Horde in vanilla so never faced shamans. I could have sworn that by 1.12 improved ghost wolf took it from 2 sec to instant.

lol. It's because Horde have 2 bases, 2 flight paths, Airship directly to Org.
---
Pretty easy and simple answer. Both sides are equal dicks to each other. Nearly every single pvp exploited area in the game is influenced entirely by map design and travel limitations.
---
Fair enough! 
---
I will say that joanna was pretty adamant that some amount of questing is good for every class and that I take his word over people who have tested on privates (I'm assuming that's what you have done - sorry if I'm wrong).
---
Idk man all ik is I‚Äôll be raiding MC while you struggle to turn in Big Game Hunter in STV. Camped for the thousandth time that day. While PvE chads slay dragons. 
---
He also said he wants to take the fun out of game development, and create an atmosphere of fear and paranoia.
---
I did enjoy how each GM put their own flavor on how they addressed your ticket. 
---
I'm one of those people who HATE automated responses from customer service from any company. It often fails to address my actual concerns and gives them an excuse to ignore you if they fail to do their job.
---
Yeah I understand, I should have clarified I think it often leads to people power tripping
---
I have bought 4 of these books in the past 3 days....looks like this number will be moving to 5
---
Who cares about developers, we need customer service positions to support the game that hasn't been developed yet!
---
1v1 open world challenges occur often, especially late game when the community on both sides get to know each other.
---
You just use /say nearby asking if they want help. This ... this is hard to figure out?
---
If you want that PvP edge I‚Äôd go Orc, the stun resist is just too good against some of the locks natural enemies such as rogues and arguably warriors. 
---
Imagine paying someone full-time job salary for posts like this. God, I wish I could have a job like that. A dream which inevitably came to an end in this case.

---
I actually watched the whole video, I don‚Äôt know why. He never mentions classic wow at all. Thanks for wasting my time.
---
i sure do love having to awkwardly talk with some idiot cringe-RPing while not answering my questions!
---
I don't completely ignore quests, I go for ones that reward nice gear but it's very different between warrior and hunter, they are basically on opposite terms in regards to levelling as a hunter is basically immortal and can easily take on multiple dangerous mobs where a warrior can struggle against just one sometimes.
---
Quests often take you to dangerous places with higher armor mobs that warriors wont be able to kill efficiently, if a quest rewards you let's say 1k xp but it takes you 30 minutes to complete where you could instead farm for 30 minutes it's all about weighing how many efficient mobs you can kill in that time and from my personal calculations farming comes out on top very often.
---
NEVER expect it. Accept it as a rare bonus if you come across it.

Defending corporations means I'm gonna be rich some day!

free honor
---
I was just messing with you man :)
---
Absolutely for open world. I think I'd go undead warlock if just doing BGs though.
---
Depends on how deep your hatred goes. 
---
If PvP on your server is plentiful, then you wouldn't need to ask useless questions.
---
If you didn't experience hardship yourself, then there is no need to inflict it on other. But if it's normal PvP server, the chances of that are slim.
---
Exactly like your post.
---
You want free honor or not?
---
You love classic WoW, we all do. And Classic WoW will be run by the people posts like this are about. Fans have valid concerns with that. Grow up, covering your eyes doesn't make bad stuff go away.
---
Ikik I laughed at Beta Brad can‚Äôt say I heard that one before 
---
Ythisens is awesome and it's people like him that made hit titles like Overwatch, Legion and Battle for Azeroth a possibility.
---
&gt;Do you think corporations are looking to polute the environment?
---
Uhh, yes absolutely. Apparently you missed a few recent history lessons, cause you don't even have to go back 100 years for about 100 way examples of exactly this.
---
It's expensive to keep the environment clean while producing shittons of everything to sell. Avoiding things like setting rivers on fire or keeping air breathable or properly disposing of your waste and by-products cuts into quarterly profits quite a lot.
---
You're insanely naive if you think corporations would voluntarily hold themselves to the same standard that we do through the government. Which is also the only thing with the power to break up what would be heading towards giant, monopolistic entities that control every aspect around your life (and thus, you) without intervention.
---
I'm guessing you're still in your libertarian phase?
---
While the title might be a stretch, the quality of customer service in WoW always blew my mind. One of the most jarring things for me coming to SW:ToR and especially GW2 as a WoW player was how abysmal the support experience was.
---
Twinks are extreme most because there are no level limits on enchanting in Classic.
---
Blizzard won't make a drastic change like that while following an admitted "no change" attitude upon launch.
---
Here's a fun story - I was leveling up in redridge mountains as a warrior, grinding out kobolds for EXP and wool to stock up on bandages. At one point, when I'm on low health, this alliance mage player several levels higher than me (edging on red I think) walks by, stops to notice me on low health, and then keeps walking by. I /wave, and the gnome /waves back without stopping. 
---
I start healing and keep an eye on them. The moment they pull a mob, I charge them, hamstring, and kill them with the help of the mobs. I would never be able to win against a high level mage 1 on 1, but now that they're dead and will always respawn with half health I'm able to corpse camp them for a solid 10-20 minutes until they eventually getting back up. 
---
Anyway, no, but it's nice when it happens.
---
He‚Äôs not wrong though, that‚Äôs literally business 101.  It sucks all of these people lost their jobs, I‚Äôve been there and it feels terrible, but to act like this isn‚Äôt a part of life and business is soooo naive. 
---
In most of the MMOs I PvPed in that had open world/zone PvP, 1v1s would happen in a designated area. Most PvPers understood that interrupting fights in these areas was BM and you'd probably be griefed for it. And we understood that fights anywhere else were fair game.  
---
Not sure if vanilla ever had unofficial rules like this, I started in BC where the only real world PvP was in those control points on the new continent that people waited to flip at 3 in the morning when no one was there to stop them.
---
Has anyone seen Bobby Kotick and Mark Hamill in the same room or THAT IS Mark Hamill and I‚Äôm high?
---
Indirectly, yes. Polluting the environment was and is cheaper than eliminating waste in a safe way
---
"Sorry guys we meant summer 2020, our bad, but you can follow further updates on your phone! :D"
---
Read my earlier comments. I did mention 2 of them. An Onyxia drop, so early raiding option. The other option mentioned comes from BWL, Nefarian drop.  
---
I always played on PvP servers but I did actually RP in some fashion. I put some effort in with the naming process for example. I did light RP like behaving  or phrasing my sentences in a more elegant way if I were playing Blood Elf. I remember when I played Undead, I would often respond like a cave man would, basic and concise, cuz I figured Undead were zombies with rotted brains lul
---
In my experience, giving it your all against a high level player rather than standing still or emoting increases the chance they'll spare you on low health. It's happened to me a few times at least.
---
Sorry to play the devil's advocate and get downvoted to oblivion but here goes: if blizzard had the tech to automate player support back then, they would have done it without hesitation. 14 years ago, AI was so inferior to today's that they can't even be compared. Blizzard had no choice but to follow the EQ system and hire people to help players. But today, the AI is so convincing that most of us couldn't discern a human from a machine. Hiring numerous people to interact with players would simply be a waste of resources from Blizzard's perspective. 
---
That said, there must be a real human somewhere in the chain to deal with more difficult situations and that is likely going to be implemented. But to say that GMs were such an integral part of the game is a bit of a stretch. It was put in place ONLY because they had no other viable option. And frankly, in the years I played, I interacted with a GM maybe 3 times so I'm definitely not going to say they were part of any of my social dynamics. 
---
They‚Äôre a lot more reliable than random speculation...
---
Instant quest text was a checkbox, not an addon.
---
I‚Äôm going to have to respectfully disagree with this. I feel WoW became more like you‚Äôre describing as more Expansions were released. Vanilla probably had the most travel and the most flavor behind their quests. (cut scenes kinda killed that for me) I feel like I found myself actually leaving the zone i acquired the quests in to complete them far more often.  
---
I don't need to justify that because that's not what happened, but you and seemingly this entire sub can't be arsed to spend 5 minutes getting the full story without spreading bullshit on the internet
---
This was only relevant during duels, no one cares if you pop a potion in wpvp.
---
shouldn't it be "gitting gud"?
---
Questing in vanilla isn't hard and far from so difficult it requires third party software to help you. There's like 5 quests out of hundreds that have kinda of vague or all over the place directions. Literal 10 year olds got to level 60 without addons just fine in classic.
---
Unpopular opinion, but when your stock price plummets, you lay people off, especially those people who aren't key players on titles in development. You cut things like HoTS esports which is unprofitable. You have to make these hard choices, it's the shitty reality when you take your company public, you are beholden to the shareholders. If you have 800 non essential, or easy to replace workers, you don't keep them on the payroll, with all the costs that come with that, pay/benefits/stock options/bonuses, etc. 
---
You trim the fat to try and save the business.  Activision has lost almost 50% of their value over the past 6 months. Anyone who thinks firing the 800 employees is the wrong choice just isn't being objective.
---
BGs did not give XP at all in vanilla. 
---
From what i understand... Those 800 were not developers of games. 
---
However good this may be. They artificially short their stock with every product they release.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt specify, my bad. I always think of WPvP first by habit.  I Would lean Undead if you wanna BG farm.
---
Because everybody is giving you ass replies, here is the announcement:

---
&gt;but to act like this isn‚Äôt a part of life and business is soooo naive.
---
I'm not acting like it isn't a real thing. I'm saying it SHOULDN'T be. Because it really fucking shouldn't... You shouldn't work your ass off to make sure your company does well and get FIRED because of it... You should NEVER do your best and get punished for it. Because that's what happened. Those 800 people got actually PUNISHED for making this company successful.
---
Fuck that and fuck anyone who defends it.
---
Ah - good point, I was thinking more for the private server meta. 
---
Yeah but those " Gm Jokes". 
---
For all the people that said always go with B when your not with friends, if I get clearly ninja looted I'm dipping out of that group quick.
---
I know this isn't even about ninja looting- but if the druid healer rolls on offspec gear, I consider that ninja- and I'm leaving that group as soon as it happens. 
---
If it‚Äôs Red it‚Äôs dead. Best motto on a PvP server. 
---
As far as when to intervene, that depends on how much satisfaction you want to give the member of your faction that was fighting alone previously.
---
Thank you. 
---
You can't be "fair" in world PvP because there are so many different variables seperating people. Levels, gear, organization, etc. You need every advantage you can to kill someone or keep from getting killed.  
---
If you want "fair" PvP wait for battlegrounds. Arena wasn't added until BC.
---
I'm sorry I just can't get excited about why some random jack ass wants some boar livers in every zone I go to.
---
Add no retards like this to the list. 
---
We don't know servers names, locations, etc yet. Hopefully we'll learn those details just before launch.
---
if my guy is winning, i'll leave them, be and spectate from stealth, or secure the surrounding area to ensure no disgusting alliance filth interfere. 
---
if my guy is losing, that guy is getting corpse camped for an hour 
---
So when you have 800 extra workers because the esports for some of your games died and you don't need as much support staff for some of your older titles anymore you just keep paying them forever just because? 
---
I mean if we were talking about cuts due to a family product like the Wii U, sure Nintendo's stance works. Or if we were talking about maybe 50 people you could maybe shuffle them around, but 800 people is a metric fuckton of people to shuffle around. 
---
Yeah it blows for them, absolutely, but if you were a business and you had 800 more people you were paying than you needed would you keep paying them all in perpetuity? 
---
Well, I'll say one thing: if they want testers to speed test leveling content, grab some private server hardcores ... fastest Alpha ever!
---
Sorry, we don't allow naming (or abbreviation) of private servers on r/ClassicWoW, so your post was removed. Please try r/wowservers.
---
If you care about pvp, I think you should go horde. Sacrificing horde racials for warlock is worse than other classes, because besides having to sacrifice wotf or 25% stun resist, you also have to deal with wotf on your opposition frequently. Tremor totems from shamans are probably a minor consideration also.
---
Meanwhile, I feel like the pve threat gimping shouldn‚Äôt really change your overall experience that much, I mean you are still being compared to other warlocks with the same issue when in raids, and your personal dps isn‚Äôt what matters the most when there are 40 people in a raid. I guess if it actually makes a difference between raids being fun for you or not (being able to go ham and have an easier time doing well on meters), you can‚Äôt put an objective value on how important that is.
---
i had an hour conversation with a GM once where he would give me movie quotes and I would tell him what movie it was from. it was late at night, great fun for both of us, and really humanized the experience for me.
---
Great quiz dude, I almost didn't click the Youtube link because I expected something easy but all the questions were creative.
---
My only criticism is I was too busy listening to the questions to notice the countdown had started going. No problem for some questions but for some of the longer ones it didn't give much time to digest the question/answers on the screen.
---
Hope you make another one so I can groom my neckbeard.
---
WPVP is one of the first things that forced me to realize that people legitimately can have very very different tastes than me. There are people who truly do get a pleasurable thrill from the suspense, risk, and defeat that come with WPVP. I can understand enjoying being the hunter, but there are a lot of people who enjoy the feeling of being *the hunted* too -- they like the game better when they know that they can be thwarted at any moment by a thoughtless mortal strike from a passing warrior. I don't understand it, but I can't question it. There are a lot of people who like to be tied down and beaten as part of sex too.
---
Minus the fact they would need to sign an NDA denying publishing rights, and would get copy strikes thrown at them until accounts banned.
---
But hey, go for it!
---
Heirlooms weren't added until WotLK so twinking will take more work in vanilla, if that's what you're wondering.
---
Stop sharing pictures of me, Jesus..

---
*  Balanced faction ratio (within 5%)
---
You are sidetracking this conversation. 
---
I don't think any company has the goal to polute. It seems almost insane to think that. The government makes the rules and companies play by them or they get closed down. If there are no rules then what?
---
Please don't get personal it is not appropriate.
---
what? *how?* hes got a first and a last name, and his surname is even a "title" or some label youd give some spooky bandit man. and beasts dont ever get first and last names in fantasy stuff lol

I suspect that people will abuse the right click reporting figure and get people temp banned lol. 
---
Wait for Classic. I quit in wrath of the lich king.Cant wait for classic it will be like i never left.
---
What waste? How did you come by this information? Does Activision-Blizzard do this? Why are you bringing this up?
---
It‚Äôs not easy being an alliance warlock in pvp. 
---
I am wondering is the orc stun resist a flat 25% bonus, meaning 1/4 will be resisted or does it mean that the stun resist is increased by 25% of your regular value? i.e. stun resist x 1.25. 
---
Maybe the anitchrist
---
And it works.
---
u/stevenconrad
---
I‚Äôm going fast. Plan on hitting 60 in 2 weeks max. 
---
When my shaman was level 32 recently, a 60 warrior attacked me and I still tried rofl. The first frost shock landed and I thought I was going to make it to Tarren Mill. Yeah.  
---
No.  
---
He murdered me rofl.  
---
But I'll still hold out hope for that kind of honor when Classic comes around.  
---
I personally wont attack greys. Unless of course I build a character who's sole purpose is to attack greys, but if I do that it'll be a night elf priest.  
---
The trash bwl drop is decent as well
---
is there people working on classic wow add-ons since the old once will not work.  
---
Oh ! You make me sad dear U.S. American ! I might need to get a free healthcare check...
---
Warlock threat is a big deal in PVE. Even with salv, you can be middle of the pack in DPS and still pull agro. That's my least favorite part of the class, in fact -- you have to throttle yourself so much. You're a DPS who frequently can't afford to compete on the damage meter because you'll wipe the raid or at least eat a repair bill. Pre-AQ40, you really are mostly there to banish, summon, imp, and HS.
---
Sure, mages spend half of the boss fights in MC competing on the decurse meter rather than the DPS meter, but there are fights where they get to go hard too. Warlocks have to wait a long, long time before they're able to go hard in fights. BiS caster gear in MC and BWL is almost wasted on them; it just means they'll pull agro in fewer casts. 
---
Long story short, yes please play alliance warlock.
---
it depends if it's progress raid or just farm. it always hard to get 40 people for progress raid ecept for MC and some extent bwl (vael), my experience you would need to have 2-3 tanks that are more than casual who can be there for 3 of the 4 raids all the time, with one MT that have like 100 % attendens atleast for progress raids. I would say around 100 members, farm raids will always be over populated by around 20+ atleast for BWL. with 100 casual members you will fail a couple of times to get full 40 for AQ  40 and naxx progress raids (personal expirience).
---
If you want to PvP as a warlock, play Horde. It is that simple.
---
Things you have to worry about when playing Alliance: 
---
- Any Undead, Warrior, Blacksmith, Shaman, STUNS (Every class has access to them, and they are the most crucial PvP ability.)
---
Things you have to worry about on the Horde:
---
- Any Warrior, Blacksmith, Dwarf priest, Threat
---
I 100% agree. I only posted these for general idea of progress. But yea, I can certainly see why it will be 100% inaccurate.
---
I just worry that decent horde guilds would prune their roster of warlocks if they contribute less and pull agro more... definitely care more about recking face in pvp tho so this helps a lot :)
---
Please explain how keeping 800 employees in redundant positions is a good business move.         
---
Yes, it sucks for the 800 who lost their jobs, but keeping 800 people employed in jobs that aren't needed is kinda dumb for any business.
---
It used to bother me a lot but mainly because of how much time you lose in the process.  I try to go into it with a first person shooter mindset these days which psychologically takes away the sting but it still doesn't give me back that lost time which is still annoying as fuck.  In an FPS, time to kill/time to death is fast but so is getting back into the action and players are all on an even power level.   MMORPGs have too large a gap in power level between low level and high (both character level and gear level) which just makes the entire process a shitfest of bullying back and forth.
---
There's no free-for-all WPvP in World of Warcraft.  Free-for-all PvP means you can attack everyone, regardless of faction (Horde vs Horde etc).  Eg; Age of Conan has free-for-all PvP, WoW does not.
---
Also in the Chicago area! Planning on playing Ally Druid!
---
God Tier: Double Warlock
---
Good Tier: Warrior+Any Healer (go full arms, you can still tank 5mans). Mage+Warlock/Hunter. 
---
Okay I guess Tier: Any caster+druid, any hunter+healer.
---
Why.jpg Tier: rogue+anything ;_;
---
Cringe
---
I'm not sure its even possible to get to 60 in seven realtime days. It can be done in five in-game days, if you are really good and playing an OP levelling class, but that was with rested xp IIRC, was not done at launch, and real people need to eat and sleep.
---
I guess if you had a butler (by which of course I mean your mother) to do all your food prep and chores for you, and you didn't sleep much, so you had to do literally nothing but play wow, go to the toilet and sleep, it could barely be done.
---
But finding forty people like that on one server? That would take some doing.
---
There are a few silly pirate server supremacists running around saying "we are SO MUCH BETTER than Joana ever was, we can get to 60 in under four days and have enough gold for a mount at 40 and if you dare imply this might possibly mean our server is not blizzlike we will downvote the everliving shit out of you". I look forward to them looking silly on a truly blizzlike server.
---
The only good post in here. Sadly, "free market capitalism" is thought today to be the heavily subverted cultural marxist and morally relativist shit storm that is our society. This is a prime example of O'Sullivan's Law at work, especially with blizzard. Essentially, non-gaming boomers, leftists, recent grads, and other societal trash have ruined the company. If I have a sliver of intuition than maybe Bobby actually rid some the company of some multi-colored hair SJW trash and other retarded garbage/human waste (see pic related: [https://imgur.com/a/BSSm4zS](https://imgur.com/a/BSSm4zS) ). Sorry you got down voted into oblivion bud.

So then you would require dynamic spawning for resources. This is a major change and therefore isn't an emulation of Classic. It impacts how the game plays all the way up to Raiding as resource limitation restricted consumable access through both collection and market pricing in order to maintain Raid difficulty.
---
This is a core Classic design feature also balanced with world map design, mob placement and quest design and numbers. The large pop private servers have warped the concept of what was Classic by design. Their concept of "bliz-like" is light years from what "no change" means when make the closest possible emulation of how Classic really was in patch 1.12 (ignore the content progression).
---
It's great you like this population limit ... those population caps still exist on private servers. If No Change is the real direction of Blizzard, population caps will be far closer to historical precedence and align to many systems balance against a very specific limit.

Yes it is, you don't need fear. It's just a crutch new and bad locks lean on.
---
Great retort man. A lot of thought behind that I can tell.
---
Imagine waiting for the release of Corecraft, for 4 years... My patience is strong from that.
---
not only have they said repeatedly that vanilla is vanilla and they want it to be as accurate as possible, they have a very good idea of what that is. example: blizzard said azerite was going to be fun and interesting, to the majority of people it is not. however, azerite had not been done before and maybe in their ideas it did seem fun. BUT vanilla wow has already happened, they know how it worked and what they need to do. it's the difference between being told to do an abstract painting and to trace a reference photo. 
---
also while reddit does not represent the majority of wow players, a LOT of people on wow reddit have been complaining endlessly about objectively modern things and wishing for things from vanilla back, which is a far cry from ''every retail player is a helpless baby who will throw a tantrum if they cant go 800 LPH (levels per hour)''
---
even if you believe blizzard is an evil corporation with only money on their minds, flat out lying to everyone about what vanilla is would screw them out of all their money. the vanilla lovers would hate it and the entitled retail babies you bring up so much would rather just go back to what they believe to be the more developed of the two games. your only proof is ''i dont like blizzard, so that means they are evil and want to fuck me over specifically''
---
Yep, missed Edge of Chaos. 
---
I know a lot of players love to say Warrior + Healer.
---
That combo exists because warriors NEED a healer to be efficient. It has nothing to do with maximizing leveling for that duo. The moment anyone mentions a Warrior, when it comes to the leveling process to 60, a Druid would be superior in any role, in any duo when it comes to xp/hr rates.

Hahha the fact you just ASSUMED ( I can use caps too wherever I want) all 800 employees worked their ass off and actually gave a shit about blizzard is hilarious.  The fact you said they made the company what they are is even funnier.  We‚Äôre talking about people that were laid off in a field (customer service) that is getting replaced by computers every day!  Anyone with half a brain can see that day coming.  I would know , I work in a company with a huge call center.  Guess what, half that call center isn‚Äôt going to have a job by the end of the year.  Your the type of person that thinks everyone should get a trophy.  Gtfo of here with that garbage.
---
Once again this sucks.  Blizzard IMO made a terrible decision for short term game.  I haven‚Äôt supported one of their games in over 10 years and I am leaning towards saying fuck classic because activision blizzard is a terrible company now.  
---
This whole post either screams that you're a troll, or you're new here and haven't kept up on the Classic development process since the end of Nostalrius like a lot of us have... 
---
I'll give you the benefit and assume you're not trolling, and address your concerns...
---
&gt; Do you have any confirmed info regarding any of my points ? 
---
Lots...
---
&gt; dungeon/raid finder (aka the death of social interaction...)
---
Confirmed in the classic panel not coming to classic.
---
&gt; never oom until high/max level instead of every third mob / having to stock up on and use food, water
---
Playable demo confirmed this is fairly accurate to the vanilla experience.
---
&gt; roughly one buff per class (if at all) at no mana + reagent cost, grp/raid wide
---
&gt; buying gold in the blizz shop
---
They haven't made an official statement on this one and it's a point of discussion. they've stated as of now there's no plan to having a wow store in game on launch, but they could change that. 
---
&gt; instant max lvl service
---
See above. Additionally, this is VERY unlikely based on how they do max boosts on retail. They let you boost to the STARTING level of the new expansion. Not the end level. They only allow you to boost to max during the prepatch for a new expansion. They won't allow people to boost to 60 in a vanilla server. 
---
&gt; mounts at lvl 1/20
---
&gt; flying mounts on Vanilla maps
---
&gt; easy respec at all times at no cost
---
&gt; transmogs
---
&gt; one-shotting quest mobs with max heirloom gear
---
&gt; easy raid progressing / gear farming via raid finder or similar (excluding myth)
---
We already covered LFR/LFD, and in general a lot of the raids wont be hugely challenging compared to retail raids, just time consuming.
---
&gt; tanks dealing obscene damage in grp/dungeon content via aoe

This is a side effect of their new talents, abilities, and all sorts of things that weren't around in vanilla. Classic wow is based on 1.12 talents and abilities, and the playstyle of classes will be accurate to that. Once again, see: demo.

After answering these questions, I'm 100% sure you're just trolling for attention. All of these questions could be answered by the playable demo, the blizcon panel and dev interviews, or common sense.
---
Please at least attempt to do some research on your own before posting stupid threads like this. And if you were just trolling, then gg you got me good. 
---
Yeah, Nintendo also does layoffs. Just like everyone else has or eventually will.
---
arms+priest/pal is pretty fast. (Faster than leveling a warrior alone. Not that much faster than priest alone.) And ye - it's mostly about the experience at 60.
---
Double rogue would be pretty ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)  tier. 
---
No one can force you to do anything you don't want to do. Realistically all they could do is kick you out of a group. Most people won't kick healers regardless as a good healer in PVP is less about spec and more about how you play and think.
---
You're going to get slaughtered by people so I might as well be the first to say it: Rated Battlegrounds don't exist in Classic.  
---
Also just play a Paladin, they're PVP healing gods.  
---
Awkward for me to post these videos again but I think they're also helpful to you:

They will list what kinds of classes and specs, and their roles, that you'll see in premade battlegrounds.  
---
You might be able to but I'd say you'd need to be a lot higher level than normal, probably something like +5 levels when you're meant to be doing the instance, like Level 25 Deadmines, lvl 35 stockades, lvl 45 SM, lvl 50 ZF etc...  
---
I'd say warrior + healer(pally or shaman easily the best), or BM Hunter also with Pally/Shamy. Warrior with good gear is stupidly strong, you're right that you wouldn't go Prot though. I'd probably go fury. Yes you take a bit more damage but a tanking fury warrior with good gear can easily do 2 to 3x the damage of a normal class with 100% enrage uptime and lots of rage. I'm sure hunter could work too but would be a lot more work trying to manage aggro and CC rather than just facetanking and dpsing everything.
---
Holy pally is the best bg healer by far. You provide insane utility and you won't instantly die to warriors and rogues.
---
Why are you concerned with the ease of leveling?  
---
I'm in Chicago. Pretty casual player (ill be on a lot but plan on taking my time leveling. Mixing in some Pvp/professions as well). Playing on ally warlock so feel free to hmu if you wanna discuss server options/wanna group to level.
---
I too watched Asmongolds stream today
---
Warlocks weakness is exactly as you say, and there's not much you can do about it. Contrary to popular opinion, I think alliance warlocks are easier to play in group PvP, at least with decent players. Blessing of Freedom + Protection complement warlocks so well, and even gnomes Escape Artist saved my ass all the time. Escape Artist + Curse of Exhaustion can get you away from melee surprisingly often in BG's. Rogues tend to have their sprint on cd, warriors use their intercept to get to you in the first place. Horde locks just have to kinda take it. Your best bet here is engineering and consumables. As Horde Succubus is more viable, which could be used to help against melee in less serious play.  
---
Honestly Warlock is a bit of a strange class because there are so many variables to them, in terms of which pets are out, spec, size of the fights etc. Matchups and situations can be completely different. They can adapt to a lot of situations if prepared correctly in advance, but you don't get this option a lot of the time. World PvP was quite frustrating for this reason, and also deaths were punishing. Res, buff, re summon pet, eat+drink. That's a good minute almost that you are screwed if attacked after ressing. Compare this to Rogues, who can res and stealth straight away.  
---
I don't know enough about rogues to answer the gearing question, sorry. Would just like to clarify what I meant in my last post though. Rogues are usually taken in premades and very good at what they do, I simply meant in the large team fights warriors are generally better.   
---
Honestly all of the classes have their place in premades and I don't think it's worth putting too much thought into that in terms of choosing your class. Sounds like you should make your choice based on the playstyle you enjoy and wanting to be competitive in both PvP and PvE?  
---
Warrior sucks to level on both sides. Pve tank advantages nelf/tauren. Pve DPS advantages human/orc.   Very little difference on either side. Play whatever you think looks cool.
---
Pally is the best pure support. Huge efficiency and throughput, plate armour, cleanse, BoF, BoP, Bubble as well as HoJ is just awesome.  
---
Priest is next best and has a more offensive bent with fear/manaburn/mind control but is pretty squishy against well geared melee and needs peels.  
---
Shaman usually goes ele/resto and is more like a support caster built around providing WF, purging, burst dps and support heals.  
---
Druid is the weakest pvp healer with slow purgeable heals and no way to remove fear/poly/snares off teammates. Also they mainly stay alive by kiting with snares and roots which doesn't work in org pvp because enemies will be getting dispells.
---
Leveling wise horde have it better because they have more quests and their leveling route is more streamlined. 
---
Pve wise alliance warriors have a better life because of salvation. Horde warriors have big threat issues especially early on in vanilla. 
---
You mean people like me. :D  
---
Can't wait to be an Alliance warlock!  
---
Nah Northrend is perfection. The music, the level design, the ambience, the story, the quests. Beautiful continent.

Welcome to the Horde.
