Wanting to play with people at or above your own skill level is not toxic. 
---
---
---
There's the danger of PvP, plus after the first 2 rounds of kill quests, there's a LOT of travel time in the later parts.
---

---
STV is still really good though.
---
Durotar is sunny every day
---
Agreed.
---
That and it has always been well withing Blizzard's ability to host legacy servers...they just chose not to. So be it. People far smarter than I will ever be are out there running private servers which I am happy to play on. 
---
That separation still exists by the way, it's just not in gear anymore. 
---
You can be a 410 geared anything and still do trash damage, or be awful at tanking or healing.
---
I think it’s one of the better zones in vanilla.  I look forward to hitting it on ever char. 
---
What polls would that be? [Here's](https://www.strawpoll.me/17557953) a recent one showing Shaman and Paladin in last per usual.
---
Some PvP info about druids. Druids are the hardest class to kill in vanilla, being hard to kill is kind of "our thing". We don't deal alot of damage but can still beat some classes 1v1 by outlasting them. We counter rogues, mages and warriors (the three most played classes lol) but struggle against the other classes (assuming they are geared and good) but you can run away from them whenever you feel like. 
---
going there at-level (or slightly below), and yes the fact you couldnt walk 5 feet without aggroing something could make this a hell on earth - to say nothing of the devilsaurs.
---
but go back at max level as a skinner, with a couple of pieces of gear, and its a paradise.
---
The MMO mice take a bit of effort to learn, but it is so worth it. You kind of need to relearn how to hold your mouse in order to use it effectively. I rotate my mouse in my hand about 45° to the left. This exposes all the buttons to your thumb in a much more natural way. Then, you need to slowly start incorporating the key binds. Like only having a spell on mouse button 1. Use that until you get comfortable with it and stop having to think about it, then put a spell on mouse button 2. Rinse and repeat until you're comfortable with all 12 buttons. Once it clicks with you, you wonder how you ever played without one. 
---
Great answer I'd just like to add if all you're interested in is disenchanting you can DE any item with only level 1 enchanting in vanilla so no need to waste money leveling it if you don't plan on being your guilds dedicated enchanter. You can even make level 1 alts to DE any boes you pick up.
---
Delusional. 2 people aren't defending against 20 attacking.
---
I literally play AV 4 days a week. its all I do on the server.
---
Cya
---
In TBC, my druid would do more jumps than heals during a fight.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh, and I was casting a heal every GCD.
---
Care to expand on your point a little bit? Pretty sure most people will agree that Horde are favoured in WPvP and casual BGs. Horde warlocks have access to Hardiness and WotF, in addition to not facing people with WotF.
---
I guess it's because Horde have to deal with Paladin cleanse, while Alliance locks can benefit from BoP and Freedom? 
---
My favorite version of the quote hinted at in the title:
---
"Build a man a fire, and he's warm for the night.  Set a man on fire, and he's warm for the rest of his life."
---
Depends. Am I talking about an honorable shahman like thrall? Or are we referring to those Bitch ass shaymins players who purge me from ontop of safespots?
---
Good meme! More of this! 😂
---
I guess paladin it is for me then. The class fantasy and my retarded brain that enjoys ret vanilla paladin makes me an excellent candidate.
---
Yeah it isn't that simple. Some bosses require you to have consistently high movement speed to kill solo at all, which Warlocks don't have. But that's a completely useless argument. We're talking about efficient farming options here and the Warlock's options really are a mix of the Hunter's and the Mages',
---
I don't want to say the way I mainly made money because it was cheap as fuck and was literally free money, but what the hell, here it is.
---
Buy or craft advanced target dummies, they have a large chance to drop fused wiring or wires or somesuch, which is needed by .. something, I don't recall and sell for like 10 times the amount you paid for the target dummy.
---
Priest duels in vanilla: mana burn, mana burn, mana burn, mace bat, mace bat, mace bat - repeat until someone dies.
---
Isn't fused wiring used for repair bots?
---
Druids have very mana efficient spells, can dispel poisons and curses, can innervate and battle res, can stealth, can travel form. We also do have mitigation of threat via talents. 
---
&gt; Mages will literally suck yo dick for this.
---
Man, I was in the wrong guild in vanilla.
---
comparing a 1 point talent with 5 point talent, the value you get is miniscule for 2h. 
---
I really want to do this as well, but how much do you think this will slow down your leveling overall? And are you still going to go back and do Westfall? Westfall and Redshore? Lakeshore? Whatever that other area was called might be my favorite area in all of WoW.
---
Why do you say that?  I've only experienced it as alliance but this time around I'll be horde
---
30% threat reduction buff definitely helps.
---
I was a die-hard WOW fanatic from when I started playing late in Vanilla until Cataclysm hit.  WotLK had some stuff I didn't like, but it was still a blast.
---
Starting in Cataclysm, I've gone away from WoW to try different MMOs, because it seemed WoW had moved past the point of no return on things I didn't like.  I tried SWTOR, TERA, FFXIV:ARR, Wildstar, and TESO.  Some of those I pretty much knew I wouldn't like, but tried anyway to see if it was at least better than WoW.  I tried other Blizzard games, like Diablo 3 and Hearthstone.  I tried League\*, Heroes of the Storm, Mechwarrior Online, and others.
---
But it seems like every game that's coming out now is a convenience store.  Everything is easy, except a few things that are really grindy (unless you pay money for it).  There's a few older games in my Steam library that get hit up from time to time, but where I've found the most fun is WoW private servers.  I'm still subscribed to WoW, so I don't feel like I'm stealing from Blizzard.  
---
But when Classic hits, I'll be happy.
---
*\*League I actually liked, I just didn't want to take the time to learn what all the heroes do so I could bump my play to the next level.*
---
I actually got a 1-day ban from the Blizzard forums for referring to a server (that I didn't even name) as "a bunch of smegheads."
---
Keep in mind the paladin and shaman numbers has to double if we assume an even split amongst the factions.
---
It's actually a pretty big one.
---
No cash shop, people actually have to do things to get mounts and such, which means there's more people available for what you want to do.
---
Diagonal jumps but never towards them = "i mean you no harm"
---
Holding a Knife makes you run faster = everyone knows that
---
Casting rejuvenation in midair makes you heal better = I believe it even though its not true
---
Reeeeee mah Pvp immersion reeeeeeee
---
Either non existent or very one sided. What sane Alliance player goes to Ashenvale?
---
The problem is that WoW 2 will most likely be like Madden 19, Battlefront Reboot, Diablo 3, or any other game that's been rebooted/sequelized in the 2010s.  
---
Take out the heart and what made the game unique, throw in a lot of things to make it easy to learn and quick to play, toss in a cash shop on top.  Make it formulaic, and then throw in something mindnumbingly dull that will require players to log in every day or be left behind, so that players keep playing.
---
Hand of Rag  
---
Thunderfury  
---
AQ Mount  
---
Atiesh  
---
Andonisus, Reaper of Souls  
---
That was easy.  
---
I suppose the difference is that flasks are the only reason to go Alch on your main, otherwise a level 35 alt can do it all for you. The advantage of having enchanting on your main is you can DE all the end game gear for a higher profit.
---
It all really depends on your alternatives. None of the crafting professions you need forever, just to get what you need. Add in one gathering profession and you have one spot left. In almost all cases, that other spot should be Engineering. But if you don’t go Engineering, which means you’re a healer, you could consider Enchanting as an option. It’s certainly more profitable than Engineering.
---
Preach!
---
My leveling speed suffers greatly because of all the world pvp in certain zones.
---
Think I spent like 2days played or so in the lvl 30-35 range and will probably do the same again.
---
I knew someone that did this, he was an economics major. Leveled with us  til about 40-50 than sent all his gold to a level 1 alt and all he did was play the auction house, log in, scan with  auctioneer, log out, study the market.
---
Dude was LOADED, but he wouldn't share haha. I'm fairly certain he sold gold to the china farmers.
---
There will always be a black market.
---
Desktop on the right next to your mouse?! Ouch. Move that shit to left, get a keyboard and you're pretty much there!
---
I dunno, I just stumbled upon it from doing some quest and looking up the ways to get fused wiring. Than I looked at how much it was selling for on the AH.
---
Escape artist is pretty good, and yes the problem is mostly paladin cleanse.
---
WotF is actually not really a big deal if you think about the classes that can use it
---
You're with out doubt the worst MMORPG I've ever heard of.
---
BFA: But you have heard of me.
---
Yeah but 1-60 is longer than 1-120 on BFA. Leveling is a major part of the journey in classic. You keep your weapons and armor for longer periods of time 
---
Why make things simple, right?
---
That's interesting! So we can expect the mean age of horde and alliance to be about the same, alliance having a slightly larger deviation from the mean. The average horde player will be 1-2 month older on average. In other words a negligible difference. This is of course a very crude estimate based on the data you just posted
---
What suprises me is the number of people in the age group &lt; 25. A 24 year old in 2019 was nine years old when vanilla was released. This group will most likely have the highest "turnover", but I might be wrong.
---
Is hunter an okay class to main if focus is pvp and not raiding? I hear the LBRS crossbow is really good starting ranged weapon for hunters 
---
Is that 5-1? 
---
&gt; The advantage of having enchanting on your main is you can DE all the end game gear for a higher profit.
---
On a mature server the end game enchanting mats quickly become oversaturated. The purple shards or Nexus crystals for for just a few gold. Large Brilliant Shards and Illusion Dust have razor thin margins, and usually is a loss compared to just vendoring the items unless you specifically DE low value items.
---
I had Enchanting on a main during Vanilla and have enchanting on a main in pservers, have had multiple years of Vanilla experience during retail and on pservers with every single profession other than Blacksmithing.
---
The only reason anyone should go enchanting is for flavor. Look, I love the flavor and wish it were more profitable. But this is just the truth, although unpopular.
---
But I'm not tied up in a bundle over getting people to understand this. The fewer Alchemist + herbalists out there, the fewer people actually making money with profitable professions like mining, the better it is for the rest of us that know what we're doing.
---
So by all means, go enchanting. But I couldn't say this to a friend asking me if they can make a profit, if I care about them as a friend.

---
I think the OP was mainly looking at PvP.
---
I think hunter fits best. Mages don't really have the whole kiting and then blowing people up kind of thing, where hunters definitely do. 
---
&gt;Later on as the market gets saturated and demand plateaus those same blues are likely worth more to vendor than DE.
---
This. Illusion Dust and Large Brilliant Shards have razor thin margins. On a mature server, it is only sometimes profitable to DE end-game greens and blues, and even when it is the profit is extremely low.
---
Even with mind bogglingly rare enchants like Crusader, you only pay 10g tip.
---
You can easily make 10g in a day selling trainer taught potions on the AH, don't even need a recipe.
---
You do have to g out of your way a little to grind some meats though right? I've tried to do it multiple times but always found gaps that would need to be grinded. Need to look more into this.
---
This is some of the best information I've ever read.
---
My post didn’t advocate going for enchanting, though it is odd that you went enchanting in Vanilla and on pservers and and 15 years later you’ve decided it was all a waste of time, lol.
---
Finding tanks for certain dungeons like strat live and BFD is really hard. Sucks especially for BFD because the quest wand from that lasts a loooong time. 
---
Every server is supposed to be an instance of Azeroth. Your Azeroth. Modern WoW with its sharding and cross realm BS has totally lost that feeling of being part of a world.
---
You can sell the mats from what you DE.  But in my opinion it's not much more worth it than vendoring the item (unless it's like a cloth wrist).
---
Well if you plan on leveling as disc/holy then it's not a bad idea to put most points into disc and pick up Divine Spirit as well. 
---
5/5 Spirit Tap is a must-have though and should be the first thing you spend your talent points on.
---
Druids are inferior to priests in every way, your heals are slower and less efficient. What makes druids useful is innervate and combat rez.
---
If you really want to heal well, don't go druid. If you like the class fantasy and don't mind being more of a support character to your raid, then go for it.
---
For leveling, it's actually not bad.  Ret DPS isn't bad while you're leveling.  You get some ridiculously good weapons.  What my friend and I are doing is we both went ret until we get Seal of Command, and then he is going deep ret and I'm going into holy.  
---
This is pure gold!
---
&gt;one proc, the proc doesnt even exist in a state like that until the pre naxx patch and then its capped at 1 stack
---
Idt you realize the implications of exe into hamstring or intercept for big team fights like ab bs battles, which is most of your role as a warrior
---
The best thing about ashenvale is that, because it's so full of trees, you think you can always hide from the opposing faction and run away if things get tough.
---
Of course, as soon as you go off the main road, you get swarmed my mobs and die. At least in Tanaris if you see three people riding towards you you can just say "well, guess i'll die then." Ashenvale constantly gives you the illusion of safety when its anything but.
---
Forced restroom break while your avatar flies around their ass to get to their elbow.
---
Nah, I could pump out the math behind a decent gearscore addon, not that I ever would, lol. It would just need to be implemented on a per patch basis. You would first define each classes BiS gear for each spec. You then take all of the stats from that gear and you add it together and this provides you with your "perfect" gearscore. You then run an excel spreadsheet with their optimal rotation. You do it with 0 gear "ie no bonus stats" in the calculation. Then you do it with the stats from the BIS gear included. This gives you an equation that defines a point value "gearscore" to stats. You could even go a lot deeper and factor in racials and things as well. People think gearscore ie something that just wont happen, but I'm telling you, it can be done well. I'm not saying it should happen, I disagree with the premise of it entirely, but the math behind it isnt that tough. 
---
It's a lot harder when most of the good stuff is BOP.
---
Hey dude. This is really great.
---
Would you mind adding a "Reset filters" button next to "Apply"?
---
Yup. That's one of the things I love about classic. Everything looked unique on toons, outside of leveling gear and even then you had some crazy looking one-offs.
---
This was super key in PvP, too. You knew how hard a random Mage grinded to get nothing but the BIS gear for +spell damage that isn't tier gear, watch those glowy red rings flow up while a golden eye popped off above him and you knew dude was about to straight up format the hard drive on the server with a Pyro hahaha! 
---
I look forward to those days of paying attention to casts, positioning, jukes, etc. So good.
---
It would be interesting to see a group of five or more night elves use coordinated tactics to ambush and eliminate the horde players. 
---
If you start soon, you can read most of them by classic launch
---
Hellhole? The questing in this zone is so optimized and smooth it makes you feel warm inside. I cried when I was done and had to leave.
---
This be a good one matey 
---
You'd definitely love to be a healer. If you want to go Alliance, you can play Paladin, Priest, or Druid. If you want to be the MOST wanted healer on the faction, Dwarf Priest would be your best bet. 
---
If you want to go Horde, you can play Shaman, Priest, or Druid. If you want to be the MOST wanted healer on the faction, either Shaman or Priest is your best bet. 
---
Be aware though, healers can be harder to level if you level in healing spec, so be careful about being a diehard healer throughout your leveling journey. You can look up some leveling guides on YouTube for how to efficiently leveling Pallies/Priests/Shamans/Druids.
---
I got ganked by two night elves constantly when I was leveling up in Ashenvale. I still remember it to this day. A female night elf hunter and a female night elf rogue. They beat the shit out of me so mercilessly that I took my Druid elsewhere to level and only came back when I was leveling my warrior who I was constantly feeding great equipment to. I figured I would be safe, or at least safer...
---
Because  you can't just fly over horde territory
---
Dank 
---
Yes, I ran an alliance guild in Vanilla called 'AH Lapdancers' for bank alts. I'd make about 5g a week dancing in Ironforge while scanning the auction house.
---
Compared to other MMOs, there's very little penalty to dying. Compare it to a game like EverQuest, where you would lose all the money you're carrying, or even a piece of gear you had equipped (depending on the server) to the person who killed you. In WoW, you just lose some time running back.
---
Sure that can be annoying. But think of everything you lose out on when you play on a PvE server. You don't get to earn Honor naturally while leveling so you miss out on the potential mount discount at 40. You don't get those intermittent breaks while leveling to slay some elves in Ashenvale or whatever. You don't get to take part in the massive open world PvP battles over stuff like Kazzak and Azuregos spawns.
---
So, IMO, you lose out on a decent portion of the game by not playing on a PvP server, and the trade-off is some occasional inconvenience. When you weigh pros vs. cons, PvP feels like the way to go to me.
---
This is why azshara FP is a must at early level
---
I live in northern Minnesota. We still have snow. 
---
Why would they do that when they can just roll around in a zerg?
---
I remember reading in to the lore, and it talked about how huge groups of horde would get annihilated from every direction when venturing into Nightelf lands.
---
Unless they just ran at the same time
---
Maybe they are like pigeons: they only know how to get home so you have to take another flying mount when you get to ashenvale and then another one when you get stonetalon and so on until you get to your destination. Now, why don't direct paths exist could be because they are different factions and/or races thus they use a different kind of mount. Ratchet uses gryphons while night elves use hippogryphs.
---
Also, it might be a way for blizzard to show off the world. There are locations which are inaccessible but can be seen during the trip.
---
Fishing pools being in from the start can impact the economy especially with how easy it is for gold farmers to set up bots.
---
Contrary to what r/classicwow believes, you don't win BGs by spending the entire fucking fight in shadowmeld. Especially as a healing class.
---
Yea, but he can go mining, skinning and then get Engineering after he gets his mount.
---
Unless you're an enchanter or blacksmith, Vanilla reps weren't a big deal.
---
This isn't TBC, where you have to grind five fucking reps to revered, and three to exalted to get your pre-BIS.
---
It depends on your dialect. I am from northern Minnesota, so I have that thick accent everyone knows, and those two things are pronounced IDENTICALLY to me. You sound like you're trying to add an intrusive r in your pronunciation. I'd guess you're from the northeast maybe? 
---
Inpacts the economy in what way exactly? That fishing is more fun?
---
Fishing is a strong way to bot gold even without schools, you can make good gold just fishing blackmouths in wetlands a couple of my friends tested it and made around 30g/hour on a pserver. Anyway fact is, one of the reasons schools were added was to PREVENT botters.
---
Very true.
---
This watering down effect is what happens when corporate greed takes over. Make everything easier and more accessible to a broader audience.
---
Look at mass effect 1 to 3
---
Look at dragon age series and fallout series he’ll even elder scrolls.
---
Each time a new one comes out it feels closer to a mindless FPS situation with far less role play aspects 
---
I'll follow people around and help them with their quests after I have finished mine. It's nice to not make an enemy of every opposing faction player and nothing is better than an "enemy" player helping you out months later because that person remembered you from that one time. 
---
Exactly
---
&gt; vendor greater magic wands 
---
does this require tailoring? 
---
I ever charge with warrior to travel too. Love the creative movement speed hacks lol 
---
I'm also excited for Classic, but BfA will seem to get some good changes in 8.2
---
I was herbalist/alchemist on my druid, perhaps by chance. In the end, though, I valued the hell out of it, and I was night elf. A tauren obviously gets even *better* herbalism! 
---
1.) Animal forms for dashing between herb points on the map
---
2.) Cat stealth for creeping through dungeons (or past MoBs in general) for herb points, i.e. ghost mushroom farming in Maraudon
---
3.) Cat steath AGAIN for you and a rogue buddy to try to stealth past packs of MoBs to 2v1 certain bosses to get you a potion or flask recipe drop
---
Come WoW: Classic, I'll FUR sure be using this tried and true FORMULA (LOL so BAD...)!
---
&gt; This clip at 1:06 shows what PI disc priests do best. 
---
More like it shows what a geared burst class can do against fresh 60s in greens who have ~2,500 hp, compared to his ~5,000.
---
No just enchanting. 
---
Yeah. Chinese hold sellers
---
The starting zones will be most likely sharded.
---
Thanks!! Yes, I can do that for sure! I'll add that in a couple hours when I'm home. I'll let you know when that change is live 👍
---
Not soon enough amirite?
---
00/30/21 with zhc\\blue dragon 
---
Haha. Yeah I mean more like you pay them back, with interest, in WoW coin not real money. 
---
I like it. It’s like the Sopranos, but more nerd-like
---
Don’t worry about the private servers. Small sample size. Also, don’t make your plan off Naxx. Naxx will come so late in the game you may not even care about raiding by then or even better you may be such a core raider you will def be in the group.
---
What people are doing on private servers now, isn’t what they did back in the day and it won’t be what they will be doing when the real servers launch.
---
Druids are super optimal, essential and amazing. 
---
Side note - In vanilla Naxx was a flop. It came to late, didn’t really matter and it kinda bombed. The next thing they did was expand the game to 70 and I think their execution of Naxx played a huge part in that.
---
People worried about Naxx shouldn’t be. 
---
I hope this helped!
---
Pretty sure he is running sm/ruin and just has his keyboard affixed to his chair so that he can put shadowbolt on every keybind and slap his dick around to get some of that big dick dps.

Also, you could save a ton of room on your desk if you turned your tower 90 degrees and put it behind your monitor.

Was the fact that you didn’t have a rez frustrating for you? It’s my main turn off to resto Druid. Only one b rez every 20-30mins would probably be annoying for 5 mans. Did you make an effort to run groups with priests and pallys as a result? Or perhaps engineering for jumper cables??
---
Too bad they had to lose X amount of subs until they changed the game for  the better, the players who unsubbed won't be returning until classic.

doubt there'll be a 8.3 then

You missed one at 4:22 in video
---
During the entirety of Vanilla I was a turbo noob and can truly attest that most people were that way.
---
I picked enchanting again to "do it right."
---
I learned more in 1 month of playing pservers than I did during the entirety of playing retail Vanilla.
---
That's largely due to the fact to the nature of the internet, ample guides, reddit threads, etc. And of course the community is more knowledgeable, especially the pserver community which tends to be made up of superfans and very hardcore players.
---
Vanilla is also a lot more punishing because your characters never really get very powerful. I have been in a full group of 60's boosting a guildie through Gnomeregan, a level 30 dungeon, and we still managed to wipe due to a really bad pull.
---
Unless the group stack buffs and consumables with really high levels of gear, you will never reach the point where the group can just zerg through content like you can in retail when you get a few more itemlevels of gear than the content is designed for.
---
Because there are only 20 quests for alliance in the whole zone. Many of those quests are pretty awful as well. By contrast, the Horde have 34 quests, many of which stack up well for efficiency.
---
Even though I wont need rank 14 weps I'd go for green pill. 
---
Why does everyone assume the waves will last that long? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. YouTubers, forum posters, everyone seems to agree on that 6~ month timeframe. I’m going to be shocked if it’s more than four months. 
---
Orc racial is the single most broken thing in Vanilla. It is huge against Rogues, Warriors, Hunters, Paladins, Shadow Priests, Elemental Mages, and every single class that specced Engineering.
---
Don't forget that enemies did not have cast bars visible either
---
you had to use an addon and it was ...
---
not always correct. 
---
Well shiiitt!!! Yes a thousand times yes then!!
---
Sorry for the confusion. I was like. What are you talking about?
---
Bring on the beckman!!
---
they're too drunk to give a shite
---
Yea, I’m just messing with you, bud. I was an enchanter back in Vanilla too and I don’t see much of a reason to do it again. I also plan to go Priest though, so without a big urge to go Engineering, I don’t really care much about my professions, other than likely herbalism eventually.
---
Engineering + Herbalism is the 300 IQ profession choice combo. 
---
Just a friendly pointer.
---
indepenand -&gt; independent
---
Thanks for the guide
---
How did you get this info and is there a guide for rogues you can send me to? I remember levelling my rogue was hell.
---
Haha, but you still need to purchase all your ore for engineering, and it doesn’t feel very needed on a healer to be honest. Am I really going to be using goblin sappers? I don’t need the res. I dunno man, haha...sell me on it!
---
It's common sense, humans are too plain, gnomes are too nightmarish, and nighelfs are gaybois. Dwarf is only logical choice
---
You'll always hit a spot here or there where you can get a ton of handy meat.  Good example is the level 30 turtles in Hillsbrad, or the thunder lizards in South barrens for Horde.  Both of those mobs drop a very high% of meat that can easily get you 30 -50 skill points with very little grinding.  Plus you get XP.  win win

---
Spirit buff is pretty nutty if youre not lvling solo tho
---
In you can also do this in Lock v Lock (or whatever) 1v1s, wait out their shadow reflector and CoR yourself, and enjoy your death coil immunity.
---
You were in a progression raising guild. Nice man.    
---
Well I was in a guild. None of us play WoW anymore. Not even many of us game anymore. We all stay in touch though. We were in a Guild. Guilds like that are far and few between now. 
---
Unless you are a tank
---
It usually works out better if they attack the Pally first.
---
Right as I thought I had made my decision of a undead holy priest, everybody in this thread saying resto shaman..... The struggle is real 
---
Yeah, and you need to tell us, what we need, because we don't know.
---
Thus why the fellowship didn't take the Eagles. WoW Vanilla explains so much. 
---
those were pretty common drops in places like Scholo etc, too
---
What about that FP at the bridge in Azshara?
---
Repentance can be useful in a premade I've heard. IIRC it doesn't share diminishing returns with other CC.
---
That being said, they are a support class, not a damage class. 
---
Shaman is the second most played class on Horde in the pserver that rhymes with Crow Nose 3. 
---
PvP is the best choice 
---
Man this is me too. Druid and priest are interesting to me but I love paladin and it is my favorite class. It will likely be an impulse decision on my class when we were finally able to play classic 
---
somebody on /r/wow made a really good point that was like, why would somebody who only does world quests and warfronts need to get mythic quality gear? to do world quests and warfronts faster? the mobs already drop like flies, and that really stuck with me
---
i appreciate that in vanilla your gear makes a tangible effect in combat but also doesn't turn it into a complete cakewalk
---
Engi is most important for melee classes (as many as possible should have it) and then for mage/warlock/hunter (who will each pop a sapper before using their respective AoEs) and lastly on healers (who will occasionally use sappers or dynamite but more often will help in putting out chickens and dragonlings).
---
Strictly in terms of end game raiding PvE, healers are least essential to have as Engineering. Of course if you're considering PvP, then Engi is an absolute requirement to be competitive (ie top end).
---
God, people are so sensitive to suicide nowadays, you are apparently an asshole if you mention the word...
---
How about you add it up? 25% looks big on paper, but it's not anything of interest when only getting 100% of your regen back while casting during innervate.
---
Yea, I’m only talking about raiding. Seems like Engineering is a bit of a waste for a healer. Though, pulling us back full circle, it seems like all professions are a bit of a waste. You take herbalism and you want Tailoring for the chest piece and bags, but afterward, it doesn’t seems to matter what you drop Tailoring for. 
---
That's great and all, but the amount of shaman who will care about your BiS list is pretty damn small.
---
Ed..ward.....
---
Yup, WPvP is one of my favorite parts of the game and I know many others also feel this way. 
---
I leveled as feral Druid  tank with my best friend who was a priest. 
---
I would recommend leveling feral. Both for groups and for questing. Feral tank Druid is great for 5 mans. Never had one issue.
---
Whatever they are asking for, if they don’t ask, then 0g.
---
I manage a furniture store. Sit at a desk basically doing nothing allllll day
---
Harder.   Theres alot of 25-40 year olds living at their parents in today's economy.   
---
Ahh interesting. I was stuck in the mindset you would be healing every 5 man
---
Dwarven mage for me
---
Battle rez is OP. Not being able to Rez a group does suck. But you can B Rez your healer or someone who dies In  fight that could Prevent the wipe.
---
Not sure if sarcasm... it’s just a bunch of running around
---
The real WC.  Because not a single group I was ever in knew where to go!  
---
Ohhh
---
Scholomance easily for me 😁. Loved the atmosphere, danger and feeling of going deeper. RFK/RFD would be up there for me too. 👍
---
If you're interested in WPvP and BGs, I'd say get Engi NOW!!!
---
But if you're purely interested purely in PvE, and were only interested in that, I'd say take herbalism + alchemy. You'll be extremely popular in your guild and you will always, always be rich.
---
Remember to get alch 300 you need an alt at level 35. People will also be trading you mats or trying to buy pots off of you during raids.
---
Of course if you don't want to mess with a crafting profession you can take herb + mining. Even though you can't track both, you'll learn where the Rich Thorium veins are and will know to swap the tracking with a macro keybind.
---
You can ofc take tailoring for the BoP robes but they'll be replaced, and they're expensive to craft (especially factoring in 300 tailoring).
---
Also, getting bags through tailoring is a meme as well. Yes, it's very important on a fresh server, but after the server establishes just a bit Traveller's Backpacks go for 6-10g which is cheaper than the mooncloth price alone that goes into crafting a Mooncloth Bag, ie it's more profitable to simply sell the Mooncloth and buy Traveller's Backpacks off the AH.
---
Druid
---
Favorite would be SFK.
---
Least favorite would be that one in Ashenvale (BFD I think?) I have nightmares of trying to make that jump at the beginning of the dungeon on my super old, super shitty monitor that was like 200% darker than it should be. The jump was just complete darkness, and if you fail it then you fall into the water with some turtle elites. Sometimes I would fail it 2-3 times in one run then just log out from shame. 
---
A long time later I realized I could use Arcane Explosion to trace the edges on the floor. 
---
ST. I still have that place memorized. I loved it when I got asked by my group: "How do you know where to go in here???"
---
The Deadmines is hands down my favorite. It's so good it makes it hard for me to roll horde.
---
One patch won’t fix the game either. When youre class is boring as fuck and there isn’t anyone to play with, the game is still gonna suck. It doesn’t matter how they change your neck piece or some new transmit update, you’ll still be grinding mind numbing pve warfronts and waiting on mythic dungeon chests once a week. 
---
The only reason I knew my way around is because of the strategy guide I had lol ... place was fucking humongous!  
---
No way. I did human/dwarf area in vanilla. I’m going full Night Elf this time and dont care how long it takes; I will be getting my money’s worth out of this to say the least.
---
Not a fan at all of RFK or RFD. They did look cool but they just dragged on forever in a bad way for me.
---
Scholo on the other hand felt amazing because you had finally achieved a high enough level to venture into it and it just felt so rewarding. Not to mention it was beautiful as well aesthetically
---
 
---
SFK was amazing :D I always refer in my memory to cath or SFK when I think of classic dungeons. SFK was just so neat because of the spookiness. Had some dank blues in it too.
---
I have 5 character names, classes and races picked out and on launch day I'm going to make all 5 on my server then pick one and go.
---
Yea, I’ll probably end up herbalism and Alch, but will likely detour for Tailoring first. I’d really like to level skinning too, so I’m not sure how I’ll sort it out. I’m also going to have to figure out how to get the two enchanting wands early...
---
Think of WoW as the Mona Lisa. Let’s say some psychopath smeared feces all over it. Sure, some crazies would like the feces-smeared Mona Lisa and would like to smear even more feces on it. Most people would just want it back to what it was, forever. Because Masterpieces are Timeless.
---
Yes thats a good point. I like how in Vanilla if you want upgrades you need to push yourself to do the raids. You cant just do LFR and titanforge yourself an upgrade.
---
Some people think thats bad design to make content for the minority, but it adds some mystery and exclusivity to the content that is hard to find in games.
---
And ofcourse, no matter good geared you are, there are still mechanics that you wipe your raid in seconds if even a single player fail to react to the mechanics. I'll post our C'Thun pull today as an example: [https://youtu.be/LaHmLZHuynY](https://youtu.be/LaHmLZHuynY)
---
It is 1.12 so no.
---
I didn't watch it :\  
---
The Corrupted Blood Incident took place during patch 1.7, but Classic WoW is based on 1.12. It wouldn't contain the same bug.
---
Ya I'm crossing my fingers for some sorta graphics toggle.
---
/e applies a hefty amount of lubricant before getting down on both knees.
---
That's great and all, but we aren't in 2006 anymore. You're free to massively gimp yourself and your raid by proxy by running full tier as a paladin instead of actual healing items. Saying paladins/shamans benefit from spirit is as wrong as saying hunters benefit from Windfury. They simply don't, because that's not how they're played.
---
You're entitled to your wrong opinion.
---
That’s some prime time to play Peggle!
---
BRD and it's not even really close (though Strat is nice too 😛 ).
---
It's just how the whole place is designed/structued that makes it really special for me.      
---
It really gives you the feeling that you're actually in some kind of city and there are multiple ways to progress through the dungeon. If you have the key or a rogue with sufficient lock-picking skill you can do a relatively short run of ~40 mins while skipping most bosses, but if you want to do everything the dungeon has to offer in one go, you're going to be in there for hours.
---
The sheer vastness of the place in combination with the freedom players have in how they approach it is just something not many dungeons offer and it's almost like BRD is the polar opposite of most dungeons in "modern" MMORPGs - I always liked that (even though my first ever BRD run was a nightmare that lasted more than eigth hours and resulted in us giving up before even seeing the end boss).
---
After BRD, I believe Sunken Temple was the best designed dungeon in the game.  
---
Basically, if you like structured arena style pvp, classic is not for you.
---
If you like unexpected brawling in questing zones and constantly looking over your shoulder, then welcome home!
---
Perhaps, however the source raid came from Zul'Gurub end boss. In classic the Zul'Gurub will be introduced in stage 2.
---
Zul'Gurub will be released in stage 2. It's possible they could be stupid.
---
Wait ... is *that* why?!
---
As someone who never touched a warrior or engineering in vanilla: why would you really want to take engineering on a warrior? 
---
Obvious Troll is obvious. . . 
---
I constantly jump when travelling in WoW  
---
It's been a habit since I started playing the game. Even after a 10 year break, I came back and ...? Immediately started jumping.  
---
THat's great, and all, but reddit is not an indication of how people will actually play.
---
Oh, and you are entitled to your elitist opinion. :V
---
Added the button! Although without thinking I called it "clear" instead of "reset". But does the same thing 😅
---
And many priests have Tailoring/Enchanting as their professions.
---
Depends on how big the servers are.
---
The first death always sparks the argument, too.
---
I think I still have ptsd from that fucking turtle quest...
---
Its a tie between BRD and Zul Farak for me honestly.
---
I don't think they hinted at all.
---
Its people just speculating. 
---
It's like a 10-20 minute walk/swim from Grim Gol Zeppelin, and you can get a teleport for Gnomer. As far as dungeons are concerned I think Horde have it better, and you can still get that deadmines in! 
---
I mean, you literally can just type your title into the search bar and figure it out...
---

---
You might just get shot down while you AFK.
---
Yes so they'd purposely have to readd the bug, and then undo it later. Wouldn't make much sense
---
Tauren have the best butts... I call this census biased!
---
Blizzard released some images at Blizzcon that had some gnomes with rather coincidental names, and very specific levels (I think literally a gnome named July who was level 17?).  These same names were shared with a character who also had coincidental information attached to them.  
---
Like getting a few millions of people back? Abolishing group and raid finder stuff? Killing sharding? Reverting all the other shift after WotLK? Count me in!
---
Maybe, but the green fire plague makes me think otherwise.
---
it was some "Easter egg" thing at blizzcon. but not confirmed in anyway.
---
Yeah I'm juggling between druid and paladin as my alt. I really like flag running as a druid and herbing, but being able to one-shot fully worldbuffed mages on their way to raid with a reckadin is very tempting too... 
---
all of SM dont make me choose one lol.
---
That bug was fixed long before 1.12... 
---
Yet they claim they lost all the old source code...
---
I’m not sure what I want to do more for endgame: tank or heal. That’s my struggle between those classes &amp; warrior.
---
Interestingly I just watched George Carlin going to on about suicide. Now I read your topic. The universe is trying to tell me something, but I'm too occupied waiting for Classic.
---
You might consider going fury for raids and then when you get a big two-hander, speccing arms for PvP on the weekends.
---
Avoid all escort chicken 🐔 quests
---
I figure it's probably going to the closest faction flightpoint since Ratchet is neutral. From there it just goes to closest known.
---
Gentlemen, milady... you will always remember this as the day that you *almost* enjoyed Battle for Azeroth.
---
It's perfect
---
Man, come on I had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man.	
---
That is false. Don't know who told you that but they were incorrect. Source code. Subversion systems have been the standard in the software industry for many years specifically so old data isn't lost.  
---
  
---
Blizzard having the source code for Vanilla was confirmed when the Nostralrius dev team visited Blizzard.  
---
https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=44218

That's what they make you believe. It's the Alliance Airlines cartel that's ripping you off, backed by their unions that don't want to see flight points become obsolete.

UBRS 10 man felt epic... ran it 15+ times to finally get a draconian deflector

You'll get plenty of tips.
---
BRD by far.  
---
  Every single part of it is what a dungeon should be.  
---
Shoulda used this one
---
https://youtu.be/4ajZqoeC-So?t=4m44s
---
Dungeon: ZF.
---
Raid: ZG.
---
&gt; my first ever BRD run was a nightmare that lasted more than eight hours and resulted in us giving up before even seeing the end boss
---
I think that describes 95% of BRD runs.
---
Never made it to raiding in classic.
---
I was a huge TBC buff as a teenager. I spent night after night going for that BT attunement. It took me around 7 server hops and 2 months to finally down Kael'thas. Such fond memories. 
---
I did run ZG for the first time at level 70 on my druid though and shit you not got the tiger mount first drop / first time. I didn't even know it was rare at the time and a buddy of mine let me know. Love that fucking tiger. 
---
Hmmm. I still think it might error again lol.
---
I should of made it plural. Plenty of beautiful dungeons for sure. Fucking love SFK! 
---
Summoning means that someone actually ran to it. If they could, why couldn't the others?
---
I don't see why I have to run towards the summoning stone and wait for another person to arrive while the other 2-3 guys are still questing/farming.
---
Those kind of people always got a first warning and then a kick, surprisingly we still were able to get a replacement within seconds, MAGIC.
---
I really want to go feral druid as a main in classic, for both PvP and tanking in dungeons / raids. I don't really have interest in healing. The common consensus is that to gear up for feral you need the heal but in your experience / opinion would it be possible to just play feral?
---
I'll be pretty casual for reference, I don't have the time and commitment for top end raiding or to really get my teeth into the PvP grind. :p
---
k
---
He would learn that people would criticize his decision to not train fear ward.
---
What makes me laugh is the fact that we DID have something like Classic/Vanilla the entire time (Private Servers) that tried to emulate it... and it had well over ten thousand players across all servers.
---
Obviously it's not Nostalgia.
---
Dude, I have the same story only add that the paladin was lvl47 and went engineer for the jumper cables just so he could rez people.
---
god i hope its sooner than july 16th, thats so far away still
---
Lel, very ironic. 
---
There was a small minority of people who thought that, and nothing more.  
---
But yes I remember. Age of Conan? or whatever it was back then.  
---
Also I doubt Classic is going to kill retail.  
---
I appreciate this! I guess at the very least that’s extremely interesting lol 
---
Gosh i forgot about this... 
---
I honestly can't recall a single time I made that flight in the past 14 years
---
Agreed
---
That's why I just overdrafted my account to get mcdonalds on ubereats
---
unles you're giving an arcane crystal or black lotus they prob wont be happy with a mats tip
---
&gt;Your wsg already has a FC.
---
You heal, root, and contribute to DPS on occassion.
---
&gt;There's a fight at BS deciding the game.
---
&gt;A t3 holy pally is spam /spitting you.
---
Cool story. Neither of you can kill each other.
---
&gt;Every other class can spec to fight for pvp
---
Except healers/support?
---
&gt;there are often times when it's really handy to be able to kill people
---
Druids are not helpless. There are classes they can beat, classes they can't, and classes that stalemate. They're fine supporting groups; people are happy to have any heals they can get. And if you get focused you can go bear and tank some hits or slip away and come back when they give up. Being a slippery healer has its advantages. 
---
You're seemingly not understanding the whole support class thing. You're also seemingly undervaluing stealth in PVP for whatever reason.
---
JBL LSR 308 are pretty boomy if you have a small area, otherwise maybe some floor standing speakers.?
---
I say it depends on your playstyle. Pvp will have more trihards and ganking. 
---
well tbh if you are playing the game from launch then you probably won't be camped by some lvl 60 atleast not before leveling an alt.
---
world pvp is a huge part of the game, it's 100% worth it to sometime take drawbacks of getting camped.
---
To add to this you can make a pickpocket cheapshot opener macro so you pickpocket every mob.
---
Cata, it was a guild perk

A snippet from my latest video. You can check out the full thing here!
---
https://youtu.be/dRmITed6rjk
---
Idk if it will or not, but the fact of the matter is, it's the only game thats come out in the last 15 years that really has a legitimate chance.
---
Back when things like AoC and whatnot came out the core of my argument was 2 fold: 1.) Blizzard would have to make some major screw ups with WoW (BFA is evidence that this has happened) and 2.) The "WoW killer" would have to be of sufficient quality to draw players away from WoW in droves. (Which classic has the potential to actually do). 
---
It may not happen but I can't think a lot of people would be terribly upset if it did.
---
Nice, thanks.  It was one of my favourite zones as alliance so I'm really looking forward to it
---
Level 1 enchanting is sufficient to get 98% of the value out of enchanting.
---
The other 2% requires no-life grinds, sucking up to your GM to get boss enchants from raids, and pissing away hundreds of gold on leveling a skill that doesn't make you any money unless you are one of the first 5 enchants to get a recipe on the server.
---
PVP servers will be a roller coaster of joy and frustration. It will be a wild wild ride.
---
October 2020
---
&gt; it's 100% worth it to sometime take drawbacks of getting camped.
---
I honestly would say I agree.  Getting to 60 on a pve server means nothing...might as well go play some offline single player game.  And I do love the organized city raids and world pvp when it's "fair"...or at least close to it.  True as well that if you at least marginally keep up with the curve you should have a 60 on hand when it comes time to level alts.
---
The problem is...I'm old and really don't know if I really have the time or patience to deal with the other dumbfuckery that comes with it.
---
It was a Private Server that made me think about this sort of thing. The kill quests aren’t bad because you can group up to complete them. It’s the loot “x” item off the ground quest that you could spend an hour plus trying to complete. On Light’s Hope there was about 10 people around one object and people kept spilling in. It was absurd and at one point I felt I was wasting my time and moved on. 
---
Of course, and yeah...some 40 hunter ganking your 38 mage at half health is part of the game and is what makes it so satisfying in the end.  But dealing with level 60 gankers camping you with an epic mount so you have no chance at escape really isn't appealing.
---
I'm not sure about CTRL, but I bind shift. It's more ergonomic to bind shift than to bind control, your pinky is literally standing on the shift key when your fingers are on AWSD lol.
---
I mean it's just logging off and jumping on an alt or do something irl if it actually happens, which is very rare that it actually does.
---
Unless youre raiding Naxx i dont consider bringing a ret palading etc carrying. This game is insanely theorycrafted and it makes every raid prior to Naxx a joke. 
---
I've been toying with being a female dwarf something just to be that snowflake. 
---
I need it to be June, 2 months summer break as a teacher would be perfect!
---
But PVPing as you level is awesome in Vanilla!
---
Shadowfang Keep
---
It's disappointing that it took *years* of success of Old School Runescape for blizzard to realize "Wait, maybe our players *actually* prefer the older style of game". 
---
Don't get me wrong, I think there are a many good reasons why "standard MMOs" tend to be dying or dead, but still- I think a ton of people are going to genuinely enjoy Classic Wow for years. 
---
Druid Tanks are actually great. No joke. Sure they're not as reliable in Raids as Warriors because they can't get Defense Capped, but they have a great toolkit and are kings at mitigating damage through raw health numbers. They usually have a better time vs. casters as well.
---
I agree, a bit too late for some. But at least things are changing.

---
UBRS was more of a PUG thing.

ZG was a masterpiece though
---
*All* classes are used in end-game raiding, but not necessarily all specs depending on the guild and how much they're min-maxing. So, just roll the class that looks the most fun! And, find a guild that doesn't mistreat you and wants to raid.
---
It's completely fine.  I feel like for a topic such as this that the length doesn't matter because the same kind of people that could benefit from this kind of post are also the same kind of people that will read a post of this length, and vice-versa.

Aw man I kinda liked Age of Conan haha
---
It is if you have the rare ass recipes
---
As an American where tips do exist, it's still a stupid practice that needs to go away.
---
Well it's not like we have public opinion surveys on who thought what, personally I remember as some kind of very widespread prophecy. It definitely wasn't a given for a long time that the genre would fade almost to irrelevance before wow gets replaced by another mmo.
---
They predicted that with just about every MMO released between 2005-2010 at least. Dark and Light (this one was such a fuck up it made me immune forever more), Warhammer, Age of Conan, Aion, you name it
---
World PvP was amazing
---
Clear is perfect. Thanks!
---
Thanks, I know back in the day there were so many rogues that I never made the cut.  I don't want to play rogue again.  My hunter was fun but play him for years.
---
I can almost relate. It's like every time I make up my mind on what I want to play, something happens that changes my mind.
---
In fact, just yesterday I told myself I was going to main a Rogue. Then I went and ran WC, on a server I wont name, and my tank was AWFUL. Now I'm telling myself maybe I should play a tank because I actually know how to do it and well. 
---
The struggle is SO real...
---
Thanks, I think that is really good advise.  Thanks.  
---
I am okay. :-) I was making a tongue in cheek commentary. The guy I replied to was making a joke and I was just going along with it. Might have gotten a little long winded!
---
are yours, almighty father.  One god forever and ever.

Imagine a world where people have a profanity filter and an ignore command, but still feel butthurt enough to vindictively report someone because of their fee-fees.

Oh, certainly.

Type /ignore and then the toxic behavior goes away!

No, its just he is missing the connecting flight paths that will shorten it.

The perspective I had back then was that the tuning was utterly insane, to an ungodly unfun degree, not counting when C'thun was literally impossible, which I never personally experienced fortunately.
---
In TBC and after, my perspective mostly stayed the same but with the added hindsight that it was likely deliberate to make it "last" until TBC was released and that it would have probably been tuned more reasonably if they weren't going to do an expansion.
---
Yes/yes because yes obviously 
---
Why do you go to dark shore on a warrior?
---
Wake up sheeple! The map is flat! Look up "flat azeroth" and you will see these flightpoints line up perfectly!!!
---
You're welcome! 
---
Nothin' better than a dwarf to jerk you off after a hard day killing horde... I Guess
---
You can also skip the jumping part just by swimming across, it skips a few trash mobs too
---
Rock it man. If you really wanted to play hard core it would best to resto your way to the beat gear before making the switch. 
---
Playing causally you can totally play feral. Get all your blue gear from Pvp ranks. That stuff is super solid and better then most feral epic pieces you can get before aq40 try as hard as you can to get a good weapon. There are very few options for feral druids. 
---
You don’t have to be a hard core grinder to get your full blue set.
---
Tatters
---
Scholo or BRD
---
Don't forget step down healing with pushed +healing. I was blasting ht 2-4 in raids when 35 dead as only healer left up. One time our main force mostly wipped on magmadar and it was me and two tanks at 10%. Raid laid dead for a good long while as I healed the tanks tween fears. Finished the fight with 70% Mana. "Would you just die already" for like 10 min untill dead. Said "I could talk shot to the rest of yall but I'm better than that" blasted my innervate on a priest that face planted short after.
---
I didn’t know all that. Thank you for sharing. My guild didn’t have problems. With C’thun but I think we faced him post patched when they fixed him.
---
I'm extremely excited to get back into vanilla as well because when I was younger I'd just always quit. I had no patience until the next expansion. I really only got to enjoy the 5 man dungeons - this time around I hope to get into some serious raiding. 
---
I'm going to be tanking as a druid in our leveling group and I think our healer is going to go shaman.
---
But you and I both know that a dps should not be dying, as a general rule.
---
There's a rogue assassination talent Murder where you can get 2% Dragonkin dmg
---
I love Tauren cat form lol, saddest patch me was 3.3 when they changed it 
---
Played resto in classic and tbc, I actually got kicked from groups before even starting a run because I couldn't res
---
Ally til I die
---
Ignoring toxic behavior literally solves the problem, because trolls thrive on pissing people off.  Deny them their prize, which is getting mad, and it stops.
---
Do you really want to play a game where everyone is fake-nice and is afraid of reporting each other for the slightest offenses? Because that’s where gaming will be in a few years if this shit continues.
---
The fuckin lag pit ugh
---
We dont even have a confirmed date for beta, expect launch to be late august/september like every other blizz summer release
---
Auberdine =&gt; Theramore is the best flight in Vanilla! Its actually faster to take the ship back to Menethil and then take the ship to Auberdine than to take that 20 Minute flight!
---
But we have realised so many more things over the years about the meta. The most new discoveries we have found are probably about feral druids more than any class. feral off tank is actually the most optimal off tank u can run. If u don’t believe me, look up taladril. He wrote a literal essay about it. It’s very well done. Even feral as dps is far better than we used to think. Guys like shedo get top dps numbers as a feral dps. It’s not memey or suboptimal as we thought. I’m not trying to sound condescending, it’s just the truth 
---
It's what, 15 minutes? that's longer than a fucking hearthstone in retail, plus it's easy to get more than one hearth
---
info comes from sources like [vanilla-twinhead](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=920) and [classicDB](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=920) - supported by the OG Bradygames strategy guide.
---
Twinhead ^ has accurate XP values, ClassicDB is great for comments.
---
Guides for rogues? Use the tools and make your own! Find out what's best for your playstyle, and build a guide around that, you got time.
---
All classes have an use, but not really every spec.  
---
   The thing is that classic will have a LOT of truly researched ground, most people base stuff off private servers.  
---
  Back in the vanilla days there was a lot of people completely turning player perceptions around on what classes could do, feral for example is a spec that's extremely underrated.  
---
  Add progressive itemization to the mix and I feel there could be a few surprises.  
---
  But like others have said, it heavily depends on how far you want to go and to find the right guild.  
---
  For example, an enhancement shaman could raid all the way to even AQ with not that much trouble if he tries but the further we're in the content schedule the harder it might be to find a guild that's willing to fit you in.  
---
The only thing I did in WOD was save up money to buy the chicken mount. No regrets.
---
I can’t believe you got downvoted for saying you can just solve the problem yourself with the ignore command.
---
The funny thing is that, after playing retail, it seems incredibly sparsely populated by red mobs
---
They didn't fix backdoor walljump on current retail WoW, so I highly doubt it. Dunno, if we are talking about the same spot but you need 100% mount for that now.
---
lightwell? Try having Shield discipline as your top talent
---
Uh what?  Un'Goro is the shit.  Linken, Shizzle, SO much thorium.
---
No sir.  This is WoW's Sandals resort.
---
My guild disbanded because the officers thought warhammer online was going to be a wow killer
---
Thorium mining here is second to none IMO
---
In the open demo during blizzcon the render distance was pretty high. 
---
In addition to what he said:
---
You can actually get decent crits with Starfire, and Starfire Stun is pretty funny.  I remember that personally from back then.  Don't seriously do Moonfire spam.  That actually is a meme for real, not whatever weird definition "meme" seems to have these days.  It is semi-decent if you absolutely have to be constantly moving, but it'll still just drain your mana.
---
The WoW Peggle  addon was actually more fun than the official peggle game! I loved how they had a talent tree for peggle toons 😃
---
camping is really rare, and you can easily just spirit res and go to a different zone anyway, or log off for a little while.
---
You must be my long lost twin because I rolled those exact 3 classes to 60, and all night elves. FWIW I was able to do some raiding in MC on my rogue and hunter with limited success given that I was in school and couldn’t devote much time to raiding during week nights. 
---
#nochanges
---
I lost an account for selling gold. Would do it again. Leveling was faster after that point anyway.
---
Yeah, I think my guild might have had a 1/2 if youre the only one going for the item or something like that. i dont remember it being an issue for me back in the day. I remember being able to get a lot of good stuff from ZG/AQ in those item slots as well or quest items. In the end, it really depends on the raid youre in and how well they manage loot to make sure the whole raid progresses together.
---
Damn you Loch Ness Monster! I ain't givin you no free fiddy!
---
Wailing caverns or Mara for sure. Love the different zones you work through in Mara. It’s fun fighting your way through the corrupted areas until you reach princess in what feels like the heart of the earth
---
*checking* no, my ex-wife doesn't want to put a computer next to mine and spend hundreds of hours playing together
---
I hadn't even thought of this until now, but the fact that everyhing in vanilla will remind me of my ex-wife... FUCK
---
This terrifies me but I have a sneaking suspicion that it may be the case. I’m just giving myself small pserver injections to get me through the weeks. 
---
Wishful thinking I guess. I'd prefer they took a bit longer.
---
The better way to state this would be to tell them to go ahead and be ret paladins (or any other "meme spec"), but just know going into it that it will take longer to find groups. If people are ok with it being harder to get picked, then it's fine. The difference is pretty huge too. You might spend hours in IF looking for pug spots as ret, meanwhile you'll get messaged while questing on a mage asking you to come DPS something. So which is more important? Getting into groups quicker or playing the class you want? For some people, it's the latter, and that's ok.
---
Yeah, I never saw any kind of problem with a non-Priest healer class back then, only the players.  The only thing Priests have to make them stand out a lot is Prayer of Healing/Holy Nova, which is extremely useful for a few things but so mana inefficient that it doesn't make other healer classes useless by comparison.
---
Btw, just to be clear, Innervate really is Spirit-based mana regeneration.  But of course it's not completely useless on Paladin/Shaman either.
---
Had a couple pals get short-term bans for /roll gambling. 
---
1-59 -&gt; Loss
---
60-100 -&gt; Double your bet
---
It wouldn't be stupid to recreate corrupted blood, it would be sad if they didn't.
---
Problem is the rest of the team takes the jump route, and swimming alone is like wading through tar infested with elites
---
It’s funny, I’ve made the same observation that people are completely talking or their ass when they pretend they know how the progressive itemization will work in Classic. Other than changing to six phases, Blizz hasn’t really said how they’re going to handle this. The closest we’ve got is them admitting they’re using 1.12 data, which leads me to believe we’ll get nerfed Savage Gladiator Chain, and buffed Deathbone set. The obvious exceptions being scourge invasion items, which honestly help people leveling more than they help 60s. 
---
&gt; But 128 armor ~= 2% Damage Reduction (IIRC, I could be off here)
---
I will say that armor has diminishing returns, so how much armor 2% mitigation is would depend on how much armor you currently have. I don’t recall ever exceeding ~45% mitigation from armor, but I’m not constantly checking it. 
---
It works even better if you just stay mounted, and engage at a smart moment, instead of being 30 yards behind the fight in shadow meld, wasting time mounting up, running to the fight...
---
Far out man. 
---
Haha, of course reddit got triggered by the truth, it’s Reddit.  Come to Gab brother
---
Raids? Resto shaman horde, holy pally holy priest alliance. 
---
5mans? Tank. 
---
With duo paladins, you'll regrettably only be able to watch half as much pornography as a solo paladin...
---
I predict players will attempt to recreate the bug. They might not be successful, but if they are it will require a hot patch. Hence history repeats.
---
Yeah I'm facing a similar dilemma. I no longer have the kind of time I need to keep up in an early days arms race. Also I'd like to enjoy the ride and not feel like I need to rush 60 to optimize my survival. Otoh I never played PvE on Vanilla and it would feel kind of lame.
---
Two elements to take into consideration: first, the more buddies the safer. Servers will be crowded during the first weeks, and it will be time to take advantage of that social aspect everybody is gloating about. Quest in groups of 3 if need be, have a guild, have friends around. Indeed once you've got a 60 up and running and a decent FL these issues present themselves kinda differently.
---
Secondly there will be no talking dumb fucks out of their dumbfuckery, some of them will literally live for that and compete to be the biggest pain in the ass. Part and parcel etc. The big question mark is how bad it's gonna be indeed. I assume pretty bad.
---
My favorite is SM: Armory just b/c of Herrod. Smug bastard had some dope shoulders mail wearers.
---
&gt; They are both very valid healers in PvP 
---
Lol, no.
---
Vanilla is bursty as fuck, and druid hots suck at healing bursty damage. Your targets die before the hots tick.
---
Hey, I'm pretty sure I was in that run! We had a lvl 16 Paladin healing and a druid tanking for the first time.
---
I was the rogue, duo with my pally buddy!
---
Cheers!
---
Have you been watching me play?
---
Put your faith in me, and I’ll show you a 30 minute lava run. 
---
Upvoted before the "fun police" start complaining.
---
I feel kind of the same way about Wailing Caverns. I hold it in high regard alongside BRD and UBRS. Then there’s 40 levels of mediocrity in between (or maybe because I’ve only run them each a handful of times).
---
You are correct on the Armor DR, and I just assumed the DR for the single item alone there out of simplicity instead of trying to get into a EHP/TTK conversion thing which does not DR.
---
It looks like PvP is pretty unanimous 
---
Imma do it!!
---
Yeah, C'thun was fixed relatively early on.  Only a few guilds, the top in the world, had reached C'thun only to find it was impossible to do much of anything because of the tentacle eruptions and Claw Tentacles doing too much damage, as well as a certain bug or two that I forget right now.  The guilds had to literally argue with and provide incontrovertible evidence (several combat logs) to the lead dev to get it fixed.
---
Also, this is important: perspective is not always the reality of things, which is why I italicized that word.  But I was being honest in my opinion of things.
---
We'll thought out post, but it doesn't really matter what anyone says. We really don't know exactly how they will implement items/progressive items yet
---
As a night elf druid I loved Ashenvale. It was dangerous and exciting to level there. It never even occurred to me to fuck off to the Eastern Kingdoms. I can't wait to go back in Classic.
---
I've met the mages that were in my guild. I do not want them to do that.
---
Look if you want to have shit gear it's really easy. Just wear shit gear.
---
Trying to match old itemization will just confuse players. The people who are aware of it will just hoard the items anyways.
---
The hard part is abomination stitchings. Don’t usually get guild runs for Strat UD, and when people see you roll need, they figure “Fuck it, I’m rolling need too.” Even if you say “No, I need 10 of them for this stupid quest.” They ignore you and say “well, I might need 5 librams some time in the near future.” I hate that quest. 
---
Those large, scary night elves...
---
It’s common to get guild runs until you start downing bosses in MC. 
---
Pretty sure ST holds my record for Longest Single Dungeon Run. I was down there for like 3.5 hours once. I could probably run it in 1.5h now, but it was damn confusing back the.  
---
Yeah, but the Mograin/Whitemane fight is so cool. 
---
What’s your point here? That you want the final itemization out of the gates? That’s just stupid, regardless of Deathbone being close to other items or not. 
---
That doesn't sound like any Chinese language I know.
---
*To whom it may concern:* I just got confirmation form u/iDylo (the one who managed the Survey) that I'll have access to the full \~18.5k responses on this coming Monday or Tuesday! So I'll hopefully be able to update the tool Monday Evening PST (or Tuesday) to include all responses and not just the 10.2k available in the post I linked above.
---
I'd recommend checking out [this](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/) guide if you're gonna level a priest. It should answer most questions about what do while leveling.
---
&gt; If I remember my classic correctly, bonus armor was always the highest valued itemization per ilvl.
---
Huh. I was not aware of that. Based on what calculation? I’m not disagreeing, but most bosses combine melee damage with spell damage, which would lower any form of mitigation compared to health. I just remember getting buttloads of stamina from my first few T1 pieces. 
---
Can this same argument be made for spell casters and healers?  
---
If you discover talendris point in azhara (you can do it at lvl 20 without problem) it gets fixed
---
Pick the class you want to play, and play it well. The guild will fall into place as a result.  
---
Also, be ambitious. Do you want to join that guild? Apply. You can't get into any guild you don't apply for.  
---
The people in the best guilds are people who joined and were afraid they might not be good enough. The pressure was applied and they met the challenge.  
---
Again, pick the class you want, and LEARN it. Don't be lazy.  
---
It is though just because they do so little damage and bring nothing else to the raid that a paladin in the right spec brings. It's not really about elitism its just about clearing content in a timely manner and being a contributing part of the team. It is absolute crap to lose tier pieces and pvp gear to some guy who's at best competing with your worst DPS.
---
Of course guilds can clear any content with ret palas in the raids but again it's just about being as quick as possible and that means maxing out DPS. It's not about server firsts for me as much as it is about getting out of MC in under an hour
---
Yea it wasn't really apparent until Patchwerk if I remember right.  Most of the hard fights before that were not hard because of raw damage output on the tank.  Fire-resist was the armor-equivalent for most of MC.
---
Hey I was on Perenolde too! I was a shitty Paladin named Thehate, maybe we met at some point haha 
---
Fair 👍
---
Patience, a good selling macro and weir ass recipes, my last toon on private servers was an enchanter, lvling is a pain in the ass, and you need to spam like crazy in org/ if if you want some money, idk anyone else, but I rather farm dreamfoil and fish in azhara 
---
First of all, u gotta level as shadow or ur just shooting urself in the head before starting 
---
I'll like 99% be playing solo because I plan on going on a PvE server no matter what and I doubt many of my friends will join me, if any at all.
---
Ha. Had my pal following me when I took my normal route off the cliff. Felt bad when I forgot to slowfall him too. 
---
I like the idea of Lightwell, but you're right.
---
For all intents and purposes, I am aware of 3 items that changed and got spell hit, pre-raid.  
---
Most of the spell damage items were changed over time to account for various other changes happening at the same time.  Melee combat changed quite a bit over the patches, with weapon normalization and various tweaks to scaling.  
---
This more or less necessitated similar changes to casters.  You see this with the adjustment of the cost of spelldamage and healing per item level in patch 1.4:
---
&gt;+Spell damage and +Healing effects have been increased in effectiveness to make them more attractive to players. Effects that increased damage and healing done by all magical spells received the largest increase, especially if the previous amount was small. We also fixed a couple bugs relating to these effects.
---
Loved the spell during Cata, peak Lightwell era.
---
U will have to do some dungeon as fresh 60 to not get deleted, and, once in awhile, joining an MC/ZG PU can't hurt. Remember there's only 2 pvp set, one u get fully at rank 10 and the other at rank 13. Blue set being on par with t1, epic is between t2-t2.5 power
---
Compare it to when the US and Europe couldn't fly over soviet Union airspace and had to stop through Alaska for flights to East Asia 
---
My point is that people like you think the final items are more powerful than they are.
---
They powerful items are already being excluded, bar maybe the PvP items.
---
Honestly, in regards to Cthun, no casual guild on my server ever downed him. 
---
I honestly have no idea what you are asking. What exactly about the mailbox would you change from Vanilla and why?
---
Really? The blood of heroes is what was irkin my girken. Lots of people grabbing them without needing to, low spawn rate, tons of lvl 60 mobs around...frustrating.
---
Granted I did beg my guild to help me get the stitchings.
---
I felt like such a baller w that breastplate though
---
Now imagine that flight when flight paths wernt linked, and you could only go one at a time, land, then click to go to the next... That is a  change I'm glad there sticking to, and using 1.12 as a base. 
---
That's hot, tell me more.
---
You could get addons in vanilla that did the same thing so who cares?
---
Armor has 'diminishing returns', but the amount of armor that you need to get to have a 1% damage reduction at any particular armor level, compared to the previous value is the same.
---
It takes as much armor to go from 0 to 1% armor reduction, as it does to go from 50% to 50.5% reduction.
---
Oh true. I played with minimal addons back in the day. So didn’t know that was a thing
---
that is funny
---
It's been confirmed during Blizzcon panels that mailboxes will operate in a vanilla fashion - it will take an hour to arrive from the AH or from someone else.  
---
For yourself it will be immediate, but it will also be one item at a time.  
---
Addons should help, but whether or not they will be there in time for launch is another story!
---
Hello,
---
&lt;Birds of a Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) are looking for new members for raiding/PvP in Classic WoW. The core of the team is made up of veteran MMO players who have been playing for over 10 years. We're looking forward to being able to relive a special time in our lives.
---
About Us: We're looking to construct a team of people who are mature, committed, and willing to be part of the team. Our raid times are still TBD based on the people we recruit but we are shooting for 2 nights a week and at least 2 hours on those nights if not more. We are looking for people who will be able to attend AT LEAST 80% of our raid nights in a given month. We will be running loot council with a priority on those who attend raids and help the guild both in raids and outside.
---
[If you're interested you can shoot me a PM on here or check out our guild app and I will reach out if I think you'll be a good fit.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PHu9MGpp5CpfVXSEVfw9EmAKmadYRF0we6baYLIO4Lc/viewform?edit_requested=true)
---
Webwood Venom/Egg onwards is not a big deal as these drop from the spiders and while it's true the eggs rely on a respawn it's not too terrible. It's pretty much the only static respawn you want for launch, apart from the sea creatures in darkshore.
---
I think we should make some good games of our own too. Gab is a nice website and shouldn't be the only one like it.

Are you sure? I didn't play vanilla when it was current, but I know in wotlk there were level ranges you needed your skill to be to disenchant items.
---
Hopefully there will be a TSM like addon eventually with classic launch.
---
Looks like the route crosses Mulgore.
---
Or just don't die.
---
Man I really enjoyed this.  
---
I wish I could do a version for myself but I'm too lazy and I don't have editing skills like that.  
---
And I wouldn't release it because I'm weird.  
---
Idk if youve done rag before the thorium brotherhood sets came out in bwl patch but it destroys the meme that mc is a cakewalk. Buffed items and easy access to better items was blizzards way of nerfing content when new stuff came out. Mc on release is actually a bit harder than bwl on release, but with bwl and insane FR sets it allows more casual players to fly through mc. Same with zg/aq20 gear to allow more casual people to experience bwl. Like progressive itemizations preserves the difficulty of the most difficult raid out at any given time, instead of raid difficulty being what it is in 1.12 where mc/bwl was meant to be more puggable, aq requiring guild and voip coordination and naxx being insane. When only mc is out, mc should not be in its puggable state (from characters being MUCH stronger with post-1.1 itemization, along with mostly insane fire resist tank gear) and it should be preserved as the hardest content out at the time. 
---
Magical rooster is a fuckjillion gold. Good job.
---
&gt;Not as efficient
---
Druids are the most efficient healers in the game.
---
&gt;It depends on your dialect. I am from northern Minnesota, so I have that thick accent everyone knows
---
I'm from Australia and I have no idea what that accent is. 
---
Definitely! I played on a RP server last time (Thorium Brotherhood) and I'm looking forward to doing it again. I have about 10 RP friends who are going to join me. Haven't decided on whether we're going to make our own guild or join one yet.
---
Haha love your comments... Thanks, good read
---
Maybe private servers aren't the best representation of the real game, but how can you say that MC is more difficult than BWL? I'm really asking, because I don't see how.
---
I've even stopped smoking pot until release. 
---
I could write a dissertation on deadmines.  It's both amazingly good and astonishingly bad at the same time.  I'll always have fond memories trying to get my emberstone staff.
---
Oh. Cool. I was just curious.  
---
#3 mages.
---
The problem with retail is that it is the definition of "Top and bottom heavy"
---
So you have Mythic and Mythic+ keys, which as you said, are very challenging. Then you have literally everything else that is more or less a complete faceroll.
---
So the difficult curve isn't there, and the content is catered to either complete brain dead people or very hardcore people. Most players aren't in that category. Most are in the middle. They are not complete retards, and they are not the most knowledgeable or skilled.
---
So what do they do? Back in the day they would have a lot of different interesting things, with attunements and even professions and rep grinds (which are very mindless nowadays) being somewhat challenging and offering cool progression for yourself and your friends. Most people didn't kill Naxx or even C'thun. But Onyxia? They sure did if they wanted to! And it gave those harder places, a sense of incredible wonder that you would aspire to. You'd love to go there and experience it someday. Maybe have full T3!! Now that was a dream! These kinds of things kept you hooked, even if you didn't manage to achieve them. You'd always be working towards a higher purpose, and if you got there....oh boy the joy.
---
But I digress, nowadays what do those middle level players do? Normal? It's more or less LFR with extra damage.... And btw, speaking of LFR. Why would you work hard and keep a schedule to raid if you can literally step into that nonsense and be able to see the raid, experience the story and get somewhat "ok" gear? Most of what made raiding fun for me was progressing my character not only in power, but in story!
---
So maybe you do HC? That's a little harder and it's at least somewhat incentivised with the "curve" achievement. Okay, so do you join a guild? Not really...You can pug it pretty successfully and be done with it in the middle of the tier more or less. Considering the stupid amount of gear that is available out there, and how everything scales to absurd levels EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PATCH, you wouldn't really want to farm it for long. You'd complete it for a couple of weeks and be done for that "season" pretty much. 
---
So what now? Time to go back to the brain dead content? Maybe make the jump to mythic? Why? At this point you've already "mastered" that raid in 3 other difficulties. Is a fourth one really gonna incentivise you enough? Why would it? because the gear has a slightly different tint and the meaningless iLvL number that is gonna get reset next "season" is slightly higher???? WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IT????
---
There's no incentive to go past HC, especially since the ridiculous and arbitrary jump in difficulty between HC and Mythic is so freaking large! Why would I waste countless hours on it? I'd rather go join a synchronised swimming team. Most average players won't care for mythic and with good reason!
---
So Mythic is beyond overtuned and the rest of the content is more or less undertuned, how is this a good system? And with literal loot showers from emissaries, mythic+, warfronts, etc, etc....There is no point in farming raids. So what the fuck do you do then? After you complete the story and have your character well geared on that "season" what do you do??? Go level an alt? Fuck no, leveling is boring as fuck and class design is terrible.
---
You log off and go find some other game. Which is unfortunately what many people are doing... I may have seemed a bit harsh on wow, but I really love the game. I loved Legion! Story and content was so interesting, and class fantasy was a an all time high! You really had multiple reasons to level multiple classes with the class campaign and the mage tower challenges! Absolutely loved doing it and made raiding on the side so much more fun! Story was also great! Suramar? All the quests and rep grinding made you connect with the Nightborne and you really wanted to raid to complete the story.
---
BFA sucks dick unfortunately. Hopefully patch 8.2 fixes it.
---
Lol I used to feel so proud when people would ask and I'd tell them "I play a 60 mage"  
---
One does not simply fly over Mulgore
---
[When t2 dropped in mc](https://web.archive.org/web/20050526053743/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/itemset.html?setid=210) it was nothing like t2 that came along in 1.5 or w/e
---
Ragnaros with prebuff items (even a lot of t1) is harder than vael/chromag/nef with t1 level gear after its first round of buffs. (Was buffed a 2nd time later aswell). I mean purely progression kills MC with 1.1 itemization is harder than bwl with 1.6 itemization
---
&gt;My pet peeve, when the entire group wipes, it's usually only the healer that has to run back.  Get moving, especially in case of repops, aggro, etc.
---
That's where the NE priest shines my man! Wisp form so clutch for those corpse runs! :P 
---
At least one of the flight routes fly near freakin' Thunder Bluff.
---
He was my ot. I was mt. Feral druid
---
Always loved Blackfathom Depths. The whole ambience &amp; aesthetic of this water logged underground temple was pretty sick imo.
---
if you get upset about not getting a tip, charge a fucking fee you idiot.
---
Service for a price, decide if you want to purchase
---
But you could bind shift in vanilla?
---
Plus it was essentially in-line with WC3 death knights that way! None of this pally BS. That shit's for the living!

Resort 1: Healing potion

Resort 2: Engineering

Last I checked it more or less doesn't have DR, it just stacks multiplicatively. So your first 100 armor reduces dmg by 50% your second set of 100 armor reduces *remaining* dmg by 50%, totally to 75% dmg reduction. Each 100 reduced incoming damage by half, so while the first 100 armor reduced the most dmg, the effect is still quite powerful.
---
I say the same thing about the mage talent that increases the % of slows on their spells by 10%. If cone of cold is slowing an opponent by 50%, increasing that to a 60% slow might look like just a measly increase of 10%, but when you are at 50% speed, losing 10% and dropping to 40% of your total speed was an added loss of 20%. 
---
One has more content then the other.
---
Haha, I went in in cat form for my first time (reduced fall damage). It was going okay till a devilsaur came up from behind lol. 
---
I played guild wars 1 after wow, took about five minutes to figure out you can't jump. 
---
Never dropped a game quicker in my life
---
What's this "day of rest" shit?!
---
Defense was not budgeted realistic itemization points in early wow but dev.s revalued it in 1.5 or something, so if you're basing your argument heavily off def of a few items you might want to consider that warriors got ZERO def from their [t1](https://web.archive.org/web/20050207014147/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/itemset.html?setid=209) and [t2](https://web.archive.org/web/20050207024846/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/itemset.html?setid=218), so high def on a few non tier items was needed until blizz finally sorted it.
---
The fact remains that there exists documented evidence that these items were changed to give players a progression leg up to getting into harder raid content.  I don't personally care if blizz goes one way or the other, and for the sake of a smoother release would prefer they only tackle the most offensive item changes.
---
That doesn't change the fact that this isn't "private server data".  These changes happened for a specific reason, and to ignore that these items could potentially break raid progression sounds a bit silly to me.
---
No doubt blizz has access to this same information.  Maybe they only tackle a small amount of specific items, or maybe they put a lot of effort into scaling everything up naturally.  Either way sounds good, but releasing 1.12 itemization straight out of the box sounds a bit dicey.
---
Problem is that if RP-PvP servers will be filled with non-RPers who keep ganking others, including roleplayers, roleplayers will have much less incentive to play. Especially if they look at normal RP server and see that community there is thriving, because only disruption of RP they have to face are people from their own faction running naked around them in Stormwind.
---
This basically happened on RP-PvP servers on Retail. Slowly but surely, they became filled with people who wanted easy game ("because RPers suck, lul"...many of them do, actually, but that´s another topic) and RPers ended up being a minority. Eventually, remaining RP population couldn´t stand it and moved to RP PvE servers.
---
My prediction (and fear) is that this will happen in Classic too.
---
the axe is awesome as well. and that fight is fun/ a little unique plus the "hidden" boss.
---
 Wailing Caverns, I'm really loving the jungle theme, also ambient music in dungeon (AQ/Tanaris/STV) is just too good.
---
In vanilla a druid should tank 5mans, not heal. There is a distinct lack of tanks in the game and druids tend to level in feral, making them better tanks than warriors for 5mans.
---
As a ret paladin in vanilla I dominated DPS in 5 mans, consecration is insanely overpowered and in dungeons were you can use exorcism you can put out some crazy DPS
---
But consecration in general was your bread and butter, with judgement of the crusader up on the target it did godly numbers.
---
Even an enhance shaman? I really wanna play one but I don't really wanna be forced to heal. Pretty much going back and forth between rogue or shaman.
---
lmao thats hilarious 
---
If we don't get a significant beta, there may not be any addons at launch.
---
Typical german.
---
Molten Core jamming out to old school Panic at the Disco,  which came out right when I started raiding more seriously as a teen
---
Or go hybrid feral/resto. Can still tank 5mans and for casual low tier raids, like ZG, the missing resto and balance talents won't gimp you too much.
---
That's no classic battlestation.
---
Need a whitebox, officechair, bigass cheap chinese pc speakers, shitty mic, 15 inch CRT screen.
---
That exact but don't pronounce the "t"
---
Enhance Shamans are in a really rough spot in 1.12. You could try to make it work and you might have success if you try hard enough / are persistent enough, but just be prepared for literally everyone else expecting you to be a healer.
---
You say that while Ragnaros gets stomped like grass week 1 on fresh private servers. Nostalrius clones even have pre-buff gear and no DM loot, still no challenge.
---
&gt;And with a 3-minute cooldown
---
It's 6 minutes.
---
You’re wrong

Praise the sun, brother

I think it was [ a reference to this](http://i.imgur.com/7XQeZhp.jpg?1)
---
Yes
---
Because it feels good to watch someone get sliced in half by the almighty kang the decapitator.
---
Sounds like what happens when suits and focus group numbers are brought into game design rather than lifting up individual with creative ideas.  
---
WoW was conceived in an era where online gaming was really taking off for the first big time, and each system took a lot of creative thinking and design.  It shows, and it's fucking great.
---
Now it is all about what x size team can build in y time, and how it can be monetized most efficiently.  As someone who was becoming an adult in the time of diablo 2 and wow thinking about today's blizzard/bethesda/EA's creative quality makes me sick.
---
Its my class fantasy to  grab a nightfall and  press windfury totem then grace of air totem every 10  seconds while afk auto attacking.
---
Shawmun crew reporting in.
---
Yeah just remember "griefing" deep down is just people that want everyone else to engage and role play more. Praise the sun, brother!
---
The fighting was always just east of astraanar from my memories. 
---
I had forgotten this was a thing!! 
---
Strat then zul farrak then sunken temple. Spent a stupid amount of time in all of them. Id say brd too because it is truly a masterpiece but I was in there so long I died a little inside.
---
everything gets stomped week 1. in fact everything gets stomped not just day 1, but hour 1. it has everything to do with practice and the realization that vanilla difficulty stems from coordination not personal mechanics.
---
Well said.  I do indeed find it funny that once blizzard had a feasible way to make money off of classic wow they pushed it forward very quickly.  A lot of it was due to public outcry, but a big motivator for companies is money, and classic is going to make blizz lots of money.
---
&gt;#2: Holy paladins/resto shamans
---
I never understood why Alliance always wanted to go to Ashenvale. There's a lot more Horde than there is Alliance in that zone due to its proximity to the Barrens, it makes for a shit PvP experience when you're outnumbered 5:1.
---
You could either raid resto and then join alt raids as enh or just make a shaman alt and just do the alt raids with him/her
---
This conversation is still currently happeing (i play retail). People constantly say stuff about wow being dead or what hte wow killer will be. Things have definitely changed in the game but people still react in a very similar way. 
---
I can't wait for classic. I just don't know how i will split my time between that and current wow.
---
We can't have finalized 1.12 stats on every item, it would affect raid difficulty making everything easier, but on the other hand we can't have items get new stats every patch, it will lead to loot getting distributed based on the final stats of the item - leaving the item essentially dead until its patch - or a general confusion among the more casual playerbase. 
---
WoW is not a venue for discussing important political issues. Is it not the letters section of a major newspaper, or a town hall meeting with your elected representative. Importing rhetoric about free political speech to justify being unpleasant or offensive in a video game misses the entire point of free speech. Clue: Free speech was never about enabling you to make racist jokes in Barrens chat.
---
Nor do you have a right to be proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt before a jury of your peers while being defended by a publicly-funded lawyer before your racist, lying arse can be muted in a video game. It's a video game. You are not being imprisoned or fined. Get over it.
---
You can go to reddit or discord or many, many other venues if you really have to get that racist remark out of your system.
---
WoW is a video game kids play. Play it as if there were kids in the room when you are in general chat, because there are. Or don't let the door hit your bum on the way out.
---
There's alot of good ones... I enjoyed Zul'Farrak immensely. Also really like LBRS and UBRS alot but I have to say BRD takes the cake. That dungeon is seriously epic.
---
[This wall](https://youtu.be/i6se4_rHyBc)  
---
People are saying that the backdoor exploit was fixed by 1.12 but that private servers use the broken version so that Horde stands a chance of winning? And I guess this won’t be the case with Classic so Horde will have to go across the bridge. 
---
Tanks are always welcomed in a guild. Ferals are really good tanks.
---
I don't expect many people to actually read it, i just had to let it out \^\^

Why is it so far away??? It's a 15 year old game being re released by a multi billion dollar video game titan of a company

Always hated this

&gt; I wondered what happened to "stick and stones might break my bones but words will never harm me"?
---
The suicide rate for bullied people is on the phone, it says that things aren't magically true just because they are a saying.
---
&gt; When I was in school and you got bullied the only way to get out of it was getting stronger physically and get a thick skin mentally.
---
Or kill yourself, or suffer long-term psychological harm.
---
I know, I know, reddit is full of lying liars who post variations on "I was bullied by a gang of black belts five times my size but one day I just raged out and uppercutted one so hard he flew through the roof and Albert Einstein applauded and everyone carried me around the school on their shoulders and nobody ever messed with me again!", but that just gets posted because it gets upvoted by nerds who were bullied. If you believe any of it I have a bridge to sell you.
---
&gt; Freedom of speech is something I hold dear to myself and I think it is the cause of alot of innovations in the world. 
---
Somehow I do not think when anyone is writing the history of the 21st century they will look back on the Barrens chat of 2020 as the intellectual hotspot that spawned the defining political ideas of the age.
---
This isn't about the free exchange of novel ideas in political philosophy. It's "edgy" kids wanting to act out in a shared space and get away without consequences.
---
Also why it was beneficial to do one last jump just as a speed buff ran out.
---
Mage is one button, cat is shapeshifting and farmjng pummelers, fury is having 10 buttons and rock the meters.
---
Oh ok so warrior it is. Thanks!
---
Mage = frost bolt spam so unless you want pvp more count out mage till AQ
---
Its most likely the class with a lot of buttons to press. Plus you can tank. But pre raid bis gear is expencive...... 
---
Yea I’m conflicted I want to do both pve and coop, but i would bore myself with mage/rogue pve so I think those two are no goes. Thank you.
---
It's hard to tell what you are going to be happy doing.  If you have friends that won't take you because of your class, I hate to say it, but they are poor friends for not pushing to get you in.
---
There was a lot of elitism back in the day, even in my own guild, so it did happen quite a lot where players had to sit out because of one reason or another, but finding a group that you click with is the most important thing.  
---
Every guild member needs a sense of purpose.  It's something that took me a long time to learn, and most vanilla wow guild leadership was quite new at the time of vanilla.  As it was likely their first MMO like most.  So I can't blame their guild policies for being as tragic as they tended to be at the time.
---
I'll end this by saying.  Once you find a guild that accepts you for who you are and values what you can do you will be much better off.  Race and class have little to do with the equation.
---
So ignoring that the Dark Iron set may not launch in phase 1, lets look at Fire Resist Plate pre-1.6.  We have already established that standard tank items were fine and arguably better pre-1.7.  So if FR plate is also better, than your point is moot right?
---
Well in this case sure the Dark Iron set is pretty strong, but only really the Helm, Legs and Gloves, since they lacked reasonable competition at 30 ish plus FR each, and the Boots if you rolled lucky.  They also completely lacked other useful stats.  Totaling 40 total stamina across 4 slots...  The rest of the set was defeated by better items easily.
---
Then we get to Rag himself.  The difficulty was not really fire related, it was always the Adds.  I may be miss-remembering, but I think people used less than 150 FR even back in 1.8-1.10.
---
Holy fuck I forgot about Mp5 gear lol
---
No need, hes a dwarf.
---
Sharding will make sure there are 200 people per instanced zone doing the same quest, not 5-600 people crashing the server. It'll still be swarmed.
---
What ruleset are you planning on using? 
---
You were killing the wrong monsters then =)
---
Here is the 2 magic words that will make you rich:
---
"Wool farming"
---
I was debating on rolling a Pve server for your exact reasons.  With the little time I have to play aint nobody got time for random fuckery, but there is something to be said for perceiving through that, and emerging victorious at level 60.  It feels really good, and I'll be rolling PvP for that reason alone.  Just think of it as another sort of grind :P
---
This was actually pretty fun to read. It's hard to say what the raiding scene will be like in Classic, who will be doing it and how much. Of course the hardcore guys will plough through everything but what about the rest of the server. Will be interesting to see.
---
Problem is I don't want to heal. 
---
Thanks for setting the record straight. Resto ruids are begged for in raids and liked in pvp. Their decurses are absolutely needed in vanilla raiding. Tanks that don't like them just make it harder for their fellow potential raid mates to gear up. 
---
See, this is what I am talking about.  This is private server nonesense.
---
Rag was world first killed in 1.4 with 1.4 healer/caster itemization ilvl changes.  Rag has never been killed with 1.1 itemization.
---
&gt; Someone spent a whole day ~~having fun~~ griefing newcomers to the game because they got off on ruining someone else's gaming time how terrible
---
You... are not wrong.
---
Which its why its gruelling. Its not very interesting walking from point  A to point B to point C back too B and then back to A again. Something that is gruelling does not need to be mechanically or intellectually difficult, on the contrary its the opposite, its something mundane and long that saps your energy.
---
Ratchet is literally in horde territory.
---
What is this WoW peggle and why have I never heard of this
---
Well, there you have it.
---
What? He never said HE would be the one giving you the "wealth beyond your wildest dreams"...instead you get to find it yourself while doing this little job for him! Amazing, it's like a theme park!
---
You know, come to think of it, Alexi should actually charge you an entry fee ... :D
---
What do you think about a balance/ resto hybrid for PvP with alchemy to back it up can it work effienctly ? Thinking of doing it at endgame 
---
Be warned.  Leveling warrior is no simple task.  It will take a lot of time, feel really slow for most of the progression, and lacks basic tools for some time.  But, the end is worth.
---
Other classes have more fun stuff they can do while leveling, but warriors keep their heads down and grind.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I don’t plan on rushing just enjoying the leveling for my first 60. I just didn’t want to put blood sweat and tears into a class and have a 1 button rotation end game lol.
---
Pointless videos like these trigger me
---
Scholo...i mean deadmines....listen, strat undead or living...no no no....zul farrak for sure.... okay, you’re right, i liked the wings of scarlet monastery......f it too many to choose from 
---
VANILLA WAS KINGSHIT!!!! 
---
Well, if you insist on recreating the Velociraptor feeding scene from Jurassic Park I with you starring as the cow, I guess it can't be helped :D
---
I'm 100% never playing on a PvP server again if I can help it. When I first started playing I had to be on a pvp server to play with a friend of mine, then throughout the years I've joined guilds on pvp servers to raid. I'm incredibly glad for warmode in BFA.
---
You are mistaking the 'catchup items' with 'all the rest of the items that were changed over time'
---
Many OG guild wars guilds stopped playing when warhammer came out as well.  Unfortunately that game did claim a victim other than itself.  The guild wars player numbers never recovered.  Even BC didn't make as big of a dent in the population as warhammer did.
---
In a pserver I NEVER had anybody tell me I can't tank a 5man dungeon. Ever. It is pretty much common knowledge that bears can tank.
---
A lot of the really good thorium  brotherhood items are gated behind turning in mc mats anyways. So you gotta do the content to make it easier. Unless you farm dark iron for weeks instead of just clearing mc with a little less FR.
---
FR is optional in MC anyways if you know what you're doing.
---
My post demonstrates that your argument is patently false.  The 1.10 items in this care are arguably less powerful than the Pre-1.7 items.
---
On the bright side, even though it's horde territory, it's ALOT easier to reach as an alliance player, and there is simply no one there...all these precious mobs, just waiting for you :D
---
I ignored a lot of BoE world drops because they are unreasonable.  This is more private server madness.  
---
You're just cherry picking the one stat that got nerfed across the board because Blizzard undervalued it originally (Defense).
---
As I said elsehwere, there are 3 items in the entire game like this pre-raid:
---
http://itemization.info/?search=phase%3A1%20has%3Aspellhit
---
I farmed the tiger mount every week I could solo as a terribly geared hunter which was hard as hell and never had it drop. I was super buthurt when that went away.
---
This guy is either trolling or misremembering.
---
Fade doesn't get you out of combat or drop aggro, it just temporarily lowers your threat. Mind control doesn't last all that long especially if the target is taking damage. At best this would let you get one elite killed and then the rest of the pack would gank you.
---
You can run for the exit, but the mobs run faster than you do. So even if this worked at all, which I am skeptical about, it could only work on packs near the entrance.
---
Compared to killing non-elite world mobs that drop wool this cannot possibly be a worthwhile money-making tactic.
---
Blizzard joked that there is a toggle somewhere in the game's code that turns corrupted blood on and off, and that they tried it and nothing happened.
---
I think it would be amazing to see again, and I'm sure it wouldn't take that much time to code in a softer version of it to launch with ZG at first only to have a hotfix ready.  Like a pre-planned unannounced event.
---
I know, part of me wishes I got to use some of those set bonuses haha.
---
UBRS 100%.  Every section had a story, and the pace of the dungeon felt like a real slog through a well defended stronghold.
---
It gets a lot of credit for being great, and deserves every bit of it and more.
---
I made that exact argument about the Gnome warrior vs orc warrior and the two racials a couple days before this post! Funny
---
Dude yes! A unannounced event would be a solid nod. A tribute to one of WoW's infamous moments in history.
---
rag wasnt scripted right on nost.  He didn't one shot ranged when no one was in melee range which made the fight a joke.  Don't tell grizzly that tho, it's all they have in life.
---
Probably the unpunctuated stream-of-consciousness rambling annoyed people.
---
I let all 3 of my subs run out. Playing ESO for now.  I will probably return to WoW next xpac 
---
Few games have me remembering every single group dungeon as well as vanilla wow did, and I've gone through end game in a lot of different games since then.  
---
Not raiding tanks.
---
Link?
---
Rag was week 2 on Nost, week 1 on LB and week 1 on ND.
---
One-shot mechanic apart Rag was unintentionally overbuffed on Nost and LB due to his attacks not being elemental. It meant that armor as well as FR was a requisite for the fight because his attacks were physical with additional fire damage. On ND the fight was finally properly scripted for the first time.
---
Hard agree on the grizzly comment though. Definition of peaked in high school.
---
Hah fellow teacher here, going on vacation that ends on the 16th
---
In vanilla my, extremely shitty, guild got stuck on Twin Emps. I got tired of being the only person theorycrafting, speccing optimally, etc. My guild had nice people in it but I'd say about 25 of them sucked at the game. I quit, started a guild with around 20 people, and in two months had caught up to and passed my old guild. We killed Twin Emps before they did. We killed Nef, with I concede about 15 people who had already done the fight multiple times, on the 2nd pull. Our tank was NOT one of those people, I just told him what to do and he did it. 
---
The hard part was finding 39 other people who weren't monkeys. Most guilds found this incredibly difficult. Nef is certainly a fight where one person doing something incorrectly can wipe the raid and having 40 people compounds the likelihood of that mistake happening, but at the same time the fight just isn't that difficult for any given individual. If you find enough people who can do simple things consistently, the content is really that easy. 
---
That was vanilla. Add to that no one will be playing with bad ping, a slow computer, etc., anymore (or at least, it'll be much rarer) and really everything gets even easier. Obviously there'll be guilds that struggle at every boss but they won't be struggling because the content is hard, they'll be struggling because they either are bad or, more common, tolerate some amount of bad players to persistently be in their raids. Nearly every wipe in my shit guild that I ditched was caused by 1 of 10 people. We could have kicked all 10, recruited different people, and been massively improved as a guild. But we didn't, we kept letting them sap our time and energy until I got sick of it, and proved it could in fact be done better. Our first MC clear we didn't even have 40 people, an empty slot is better than a bad player precisely because of your point, that one mistake by one guy can wipe the raid, so you don't raid with those people and then it is easy. 
---
Okay yes there are some mechanics like you said, but compare it to modern bosses say Mythic Mekkatorque. When 1 ability has more mechanics in it then 1 phase that you described.  
---
Wormhole Generator is cast teleporting all players onto a marked player, 3 players are marked with bombs that need to be line of sighted so they have to run too 1 of 3 zones to drop them but there are also radiation zones there from previous bombs that 2 ticks will kill you.  
---
Now after the teleport the boss crashes down on the teleport location so you have to move out of the circle before he lands, that would not be too big of an issue if it was not for 4 raid members getting sheeped at crash down location and 4 members being teleported to almost lethal height right above the crash down. So healers need to dispell the polly and players need to find a way down from the teleport like getting gripped by priests.  Also the people with the bomb can be targeted with both these mechanics...   
---
That is just one mechanic in a 6 minute fight. It's over in 3 seconds yet that much needs to happen.
---
Nobody seems to have said it yet, so Druid trick: You can turn into a bear while you are a bear to get rid of roots and slows (or a cat while you are a cat). You need to use a macro because you can't click on the bear power while you are a bear.
---
I used to have a macro that would turn me into whatever I currently was, so I could just mash that one button to get rid of slows whether I was a bear or in travel form or whatever. Very handy in WSG.
---
So why you acting like shit t2 dropping in mc was some big imba
---
*hopping, my bad.
---
Well, exactly what I was trying to say? PI + best caster burst class = lots of dead. 
---
Elemental shaman is the best on demand burster in the game, hence it only makes sense to team up with one to have fun.
---
It also really does not matter if you get hit for 6k damage in 3seconds if you are naxx geared to a fresh 60 if you have no healer.
---
Are you not aware what sub you are in? 
---
Zul’Farrak and DM. I think they have strong flavorful themes, and very memorable scenes. 
---
No i can confirm it is a viable tactic.  Soloed up to every first boss often slightly above my level.
---
Must be Alliance lol
---
Because it’s awesome? Plagued animals, demons, ashenvale.
---
You didn't consider FR gear for tanks in MC, which is a lot easier to get with rep recipes being available off the bat, which is the hard part about MC really. You also didn't consider the fact that some items simply weren't in the game by a certain patch, the axe off strat UD comes to mind, which is really good threat for tanks.
---
That seems reasonable, and it is definitely something to look for in a class, but a lot of the one button rotation classes still offer a good deal of utility to any group.  Hunters tranq, locks summon, mages conjure, just to name a few.  It's less about how a class plays in vanilla, and more about what you make of it.

3 common PvP specs centered around the Disc tree. Before you ask, yes there are PvP specs centered around having more points in Holy.
---
There's at least 10 ways to spec a Priest, it all depends on your personal preference and playstyle!
---
most leveling guides opt for a route that's pretty much hopping between darkshore, redridge and loch modan, skipping most if not all of westfall
---
Pathfinder. 
---
How on earth do you choose between mage and resto drood?
---
I love resto druids, but I started my first rdruid in TBC so I was playing arguably the most improved class in TBC. It was amazing.
---
But frost mage is just SO fun. And if you don't like the feral playstyle, mage is also so lovely to level in Vanilla. The only thing is, mage raiding is a snoozefest compared to a healing role.
---
What would you do? What would you level first?
---
It's amazing how quickly a boss dies when it's been on farm for years prior.
---
Wow, is it off gcd?
---
Point out another one and I can probably draw the same conclusions.
---
I always loved the night elf zones as alliance. First PvP was in dark shore, first time being decimated was in ashenvale. First time really messing with horde was felwood. It’s all got a certain charm to it, winning or losing. 
---
There is another post in this thread about FR I will refer you to.
---
So there are a pack of five mobs. You MC one and start a fight and it gets killed - if that happens without heartbeat resist breaking the MC. Now four of them are after you. What happens then?
---
Fade won't do shit.
---
If you MC one of them then the other three will beat the shit out of you.
---
Plus you'll have no +hit gear while levelling so MC is unreliable as hell.
---
And if you are running in and out of the instance between every kill, how the hell is that going to make "great bank" compared to just killing world non-elites that drop wool?
---
My guess is this is some pirate server thing where MC or Fade or something wasn't coded right.
---
Hope you gave your gold to a friend right before..
---
Yes. The server reputation was such a big deal. I had an enchanted friend IRL who completely monopolized all Enchanter mats in the AH. He would buy out everything under his Asking price. 
---
He had quite the negative reputation. It was awesome.
---
yep, if it's too crowded just move on and do a different quest and grind mobs somewhere or along the way to mitigate the lost xp
---
during big pserver launches i skip quests entirely (except class quest) until i hit level 12-15 depending on how fast i can escape the zerg.
---
can't wait for some news about launch/sharding etc. it totally changes how you tackle early levels
---
For real, so many amazing dungeons.
---
Contested mate
---
it's because he's missing the azshara fp
---
Because of the guards you mean?
---
Neat trick to stop keyboard turning.
---
What do you mean? Does retail have more red mobs? I dont play so just curious
---
Best Dungeon? Easy!
---
Gnomeregan or Stockades.
---
Jk. I didn't even did those. 
---
Literally those types of situations is what made vanilla great. With all this cross server bullshit, you aren’t held accountable socially for what you do in the game. It creates a disconnect.
---
Are you talking about retail vanilla or a private server?
---
just kind of sucks that guns get dropped as far as gear upgrades are concerned =/ theyre all dumpy melee stat sticks once you start raiding, sadly
---
How many druids do/did you run and what specs?
---
Horde or alliance and why?
---
Ah, well you'll probably be able to find a guild. Just no guarantee like other classes, though.
---
Even pally can be a trash tank.
---
Flight paths have weird things. In my guild I found it is faster to fly to get to everlook from ogrimmar.
---
It’s faster to fly to azshara then to everlook because ogrimmar takes this ridiculous scenic route. 
---
I thought I was such hot shit rolling in on my kodo with t2 shoulders,  crown of rag, and earthshaker 
---
Lmao. 
---
On top of warrior DPSing you (have to) change it up every once in a while.
---
Most furies will farm some kind of tank gear to hop in and offtank on certain bosses and trash, so you will not even hit the same abilities always, but switch back and forth from tanking (in fury spec) to DPSing.
---
I wasn't?  I was using it as juxtaposition, but I guess that was lost on you.
---
Go arcanite reaper in the meantime 👌
---
Once the servers are around for a bit you can usually find them on the auction hall.  Outside of that you'll just have to hoof it over there and get them yourself.  
---
Great memories of sitting next to my picnic set up on my 19 twink..
---
Sort of, but not really. There were plenty of fights in mc and bwl where shield block guaranteed nothing. I mean just a regular fight with no melee slow is 1 attack per 2 sec and shield block is 1 block per 2.5 sec. And anyway even if that were true, why you ranting on about def and deathbone as if it's the be all end all.  You're talking about armor that some paladin's going to wear to tank zg when zg's been irrelevant for months.  
---
Itemization improved, talents improved, mechanics improved, generally all to make the game easier.  +melee hit didn't remove dw penalty until like 1.6.  There was zero spell hit in the game.  Yes there were offsets, like non-normalized SS and negative spell resistance, but net, with gear, with everything, you were up shit creek in early vanilla.
---
Drop rate is highest in the Deadmines itself....  but if you sneak into the Gold Coast Quarry you should be alone.  a lot of people i know stay away from tight places like caves for questing.
---
I really enjoyed your video, but the last 1:30 of audio kinda went down hill. Had to turn my volume way up after Drill Sergeant Gnome.

Defias mask is bop.  You're thinking of blood elf bandit mask.
---
I'm gonna say Scholomance, for the atmosphere. Least favorite is Mauradon. I HATE that dungeon.
---
For PvP everything is fun on it's own because you are using everything you have. 
---
PvE though you are limited when it comes to raiding in terms of being as efficient as possible.
---
Mages - 1 spell
---
Warlocks - 1 spell
---
Hunter - 2 spell
---
Rogue - 3 spells
---
Warrior tank/dps - 5+ spells
---
Healers imo are the most fun when it comes to raiding because there's no rotation you are a reactive class
---
Healers (priest/pally/shaman/druid) - many spells and many different ranks of those spells. 
---
As far as lvling is concerned again its about being efficient so you generally don't want to button mash every mob. Warriors and rogues are the only melee class that can't heal so you have to be selective with pulls but rogue does have an oshit button. You pull too much (more than one mob) on a warrior and your running back to your body. 
---
You might be curious to know that the best in slot, pre-raid belt used to be [something like this](http://itemization.info/item/4329).  So I cannot really find fault in some blue belt being good too.
---
So when they were developing WoW, the only way they could get flying taxis in the game was to route through very specific spots so that the game could stream all of the graphics and textures while maintaining an acceptable framerate. 
---
Kind've funny because when they showed flying taxis at E3 2003 an everquest developer was pissed off because his developers told him that flying taxis were impossible to implement.
---
I’ve never seen someone play WoW windowed. Interesting. 
---
Also - Ventrilo and Fraps.  Nice.
---
Um no, boss swings were much slower than 2s mate.  
---
I'd rather the game had no censorship. Including racism and real world trading advertisements and anything else i don't agree with. 
---
Not to mention that specific quest only gives like 300xp, if nobody is fighting over it or the mobs there it’d prob be worth to grind out Trolls for xp and the troll quest, but otherwise the tools quest just isn’t worth it. 
---
Cool but this is bc
---
yeah.  lack of knowledge.  if people ran 1-60 and ragnaros for 15 years hed die with 1.1 itemization
---
All things considered, rogue + priest or pally/shaman will make life so much better for everyone involved. Questing can become 2x as fast, and you have the privilege of being able to start a dungeon group and only need 3x dps
---
I honestly feel like retail WoW is overencumbered.
---
If every mob (Diablo 3 affixes) and every boss has shitloads of abilities and makes you a pirouetting ballerina it loses it's appeal. There is nothing special about a Nefarian if the rest of the bosses also have a gazillian abilities.
---
It takes out the RPG element in favor of MOBAesque APM spam and movement checks. 
---
Just my opinion!
---
if youre not FR capped as a tank youre instantly dead.  and tank items are not better before the 1.7 defense nerf.  until 1.5 or 1.6 t1 warrior sets didnt have any defense on any of the pieces, half of them were dps pieces, stamina and crit, a wild array of stuff.  really go check out the items.  https://itemization.github.io/all/armor/legs/legplates-of-wrath-16962.html for example, and that is an insanely strong piece for 1.1 still. has 0 defense.  in order to tank ragnaros in 1.1 and FR cap you basically need almost every slot literally a green of fire resistance which seriously gimps you on stats.  a couple high fire resistance items from strat undead, some of the only statted fire resistance is the brd incendius loot.  imagine main tanking rag with a bunch of random fire resi gear, vs tanking rag with dark iron set that has insane stamina and double the fire resist, such that you can put on regular high stamina tank gear in the other slots
---
There was no one shot mechanic on rag on nost.  He just spun around like a ballerina when no one was in melee range.
---
DING! 
---
nope.
---
The food isn't necessarily free because the items have value to other players. You are spending time to gather materials and choosing to use them for yourself instead of sell them for gold. They are free in the sense it won't cost you gold at a vendor but it will cost you time.

The guy who got me into wow was an undead rogue high warlord. So naturally I rolled undead rogue. Looked so cool to me. Spent two weeks dicking around and got to level 17. Came across a level 60 Tauren Druid with the giant tier.5 should pieces the big bird wings that shout straight up. From that moment on I was hooked. Spent time looking into druids and decided I wanted to play night elf because I liked the shoulders better on them. 
---
My whole Druid and night elf decision was made solely on those shoulder pads. Which I farmed for 2 years and they never once dropped for me. Hahah!
---
But I'm so looking forward to fem NE and shadowmeld + drink or shadowmeld + mind control (or just being able to afk in contested zones in general) :/ Also NE have tiger mounts by default.. so yeah, toughest choice I'll have to make.
---
That's beause technically Azshara is a level 20 zone - you visit it once, to mark the flypath, and never return until endgame.
---
One Druid, basically every spec. I had a full boomkin, full tier sets, full+heal set, full mp5, full tanking set, full car set, and poison and fire resistance sets.
---
&gt; I hate the fucking Eagles
---
right, they broke World PVP in the Return of the King expansion
---
Retail. Never been on a private server.
---
Don't know what or who you teach but if they're teenage kids definitely write something WoW related on the board on the last day of school.
---
I know if I saw my teacher reference WoW like that it'd win him a million brownie points.
---
Something like: 
---
"And remember kids, stay out of ST:Vietnam if you know what's good for ya ;)." - /u/StuffitExpander
---
&gt;is that why?!
---
tbh it's because he doesn't have the azshara flightmaster tagged
---
I don’t see much negativity in it as a long as your heals stay good in raids and your happy.
---
Um, rag did 500 firedmg/s, not really game breaking.
---
Grats!

Hey numbnuts were all waiting on the release date, it should be the shuriken. 9x

I want to read that dissertation! 
---
Could you share the top few reasons it's good and that it's bad?
---
If you budget well, innervate shouldn't be necessary.  It's more like a slight hps increase cd.  I'd say it's best used for people that get battle rezzed.
---
I can't say exactly what it did in retail vanilla since I was young and a mage.  I can't seem to find a definitive answer to that.  All the private server databases show what I remember from playing on them, which is by no means accurate.  Innervate is just 400% increased mana regen(not yet spirit based), and 100% of mana regen allowed while casting.  So a shaman with +50 mp5 on gear will still increase 400%, but the 2nd bonus of the spell isn't very helpful.  Spirit based regen is always stronger though, especially with 100% mana regen while casting.  However, I do remember getting full mana as a resto shaman with Innervate.

Plainsrunning for Tauren?  It'll completely break the game!  We need a mount for Worgen?  How about Plainsrunning!

---
These are the kind of changes I'm OK with.  I don't want you to pick a specific version, I want you to pick the things that were the most fun and make sure they make it to Classic.  Like Old AV.
---
That would be ds/ruin
---
Yeah I'm not downloading and running that .exe. Can you share what exactly this program is supposed to do?
---
I hear this all the time but nobody ever gives any argument for it.
---
Only important thing bears lacks compared to warriors is good CD abilities. While that is a useful thing it does not make bears unviable. They have similar threat and similar mitigation as warriors in a competent group.
---
Defense capping hasn't been on the table for warriors for quite a while. People became so much better at the game that the single biggest factor for tank is threat generation. Warriors sacrifice their defensive gear so they can output more damage. Some even go dual wield partial fury spec just to keep up with the damage dealers.
---
Yet on the other hand we dismiss bears simply because they can be critted. Which, with the insane armor and hp or bears isn't really an issue with competent healers. 
---
On the other hand no warrior can ever achieve the amount of threat a bear can output, which, as I mentioned above, is the single most important thing that defines a tanks performance. If you can survive the encounter without draining the healers mana too much, you are defensive enough. And bears achieve that no problem.+
---
I suspect there will be a huge number of "play what you want" guilds.  I'm not going to Classic to be optimal.  I'm going there to have the most fun I can.
---
Which one?
---
Hunters seem to have a pretty complex rotation.
---
&gt; warhammer online
---
That was a heart breaker.
---
I disagree, wand spec should be first, spirit tap second. 
---
Aimed shot multi shot on CD that's about it
---
Is it going to happen any that 40-man raids build groups consisting of 1 balance and 4 mages, or something like 1 cat and 4 rogues/fury?
---
This wasn’t even in Vanilla. It was removed in beta.
---
A long costly flight with multiple changeovers from wyvern to gryphon hippogryph... a true vanilla experience. 
---
I'm fine with the change as long as they're only able to run on actual plains and can't use regular mounts.
---
I remember this. Not many people do and when I talk to others that played in vanilla most of them don't even remember it. 
---
Haha that sounds like an epic Jurassic Park adventure!
---
Yes, that's what I said, no?
---
Do whatever you want up to 40. Then tell him to have Windfury Totem up 24/7. You will feel like a god.

It was changed very early in, I might not of even been 60 and I played at launch

Hi, thank you for your feedback!

Ergodox ez with brown seitches for keyboard and zowie fk1 for mouse
---
Still fun.
---
At least if you get the killing blow, you cut down on their repair bill!
---
The small implementation of trading and potentially sharding are QoL changes. Not being able to roll the opposing faction on a PVP server is a fundamental. Won't happen, they don't need to confirm it.
---
I need sunshine and exercise, but I live in England, so I guess just exercise will have to do.
---
So what if people hoard the items? They still need to farm them, they still have to do everything. I'd rather have that than people having access to it from the start.
---
Telling people to just wear bad gear is like telling someone to go play vanilla on retail. Just top levelling at 60! Right....
---
It would be funny if they enabled it for a short time after zg launches to commemorate historic the outbreak.
---
I leveled a mage recently on a
---
pserver and 3/3 definitely did override CoC with the much shorter duration blizzard debuff. 2/3 is the way to go.
---
Here's a picture of what it looks like

---
You could take it further and make it have options for what kind of thing they prefer, e.g. melee, caster/ranged, able to tank, able to heal, mobile, etc. It'd actually be a useful tool at that point as that's what I always tend to ask people, you break down the classes into what you'd want and find by narrowing down the choices. 
---
Apart from the cross faction collusion issues, sometimes it's nice to just log in on a random server you don't normally play on, and level on your own without having to talk to anyone on your friends list or in your guild. Sure the big thing about classic is the community and that's what I'm looking forward to, but I remember before battle net I would have some private characters for when I just wanted to chill and level without talking to people.  It's like you can't play any games in private any more or at least not without having to go invisible etc on Steam, I don't think there's even a way to do this on battle net? 
---
You can also skip the jump and a trash pack by hugging the wall on the left 
---
You don't demonstrate that. Are you saying that there arent specific items available in 1.12 that make even some raiding items obsolete? It's fine if you just add together stats, that's not what this is about.
---
Fact is that NOTHING got worse in 1.10 compared to 1.7. I cannot think of a single item that Blizzard really nerfed. Even if you somehow prove that there was another 1.7 item that was better than this other item improved in 1.10, it still doesn't change the fact that 1.10 made good items way easier to get, which is the whole point.
---
every new zone in retail is insanely packed with red mobs, in part because of world quests, so even if un'goro is technically full of mobs it feels barren by comparison
---
Shit, I really should have known better from playing Druid nearly all of Classic.  I mixed the cooldown up with later expansions'.  That's really embarrassing, but oh well.  Anyway, that even longer cooldown just further strengthens the point that people shouldn't place too much value on it.
---
Also, I thought base natural mana regen was still decent?  Huh, I guess not.  My memory's a little unclear about that.  I do remember Spirit wasn't very good but it also wasn't too bad either.  However, the more I think about it, the more right you sound, to the point it'd probably be better to use it on even a Mage, I think?
---
That's a great idea! I'll be sure to make an updated version with those features. Thank you so much for your feedback :)
---
What if the 16th July was a hint for the next “step” (=Beta) and not the release date?
---
I totally feel you.
---
Currently you can set yourself as "Appear Offline" in Bnet which also hides you when you're in game. Unless your friends added your character's name, then it will pop up for them.
---
how come planes never fly over the poles, if its a shorter route :)
---
&gt; on a pserver 
---
Go ahead and throw that expert opinion in the trash. We won't know for sure how official Classic will work.
---
That’s how it works on pservers. No guarantee that’s how it will work on the official classic server. There’s likely very few people who took note of how these spells interacted in vanilla. 
---
I don’t see a problem, it’s classic WoW, y’all bastards cried how badly you wanted the old days, suck it up princess.
---
while i definitely see the appeal in being able to do every raid or why somebody might be upset that a new raid basically means there isn't any new content for them, i also really agree that it adds mystery and allure. i started in cata and i would read everything i could find about naxxramas and aq40, obsess over the lore, how you had to open the gates, how tough it was to get to the final raid. i realize the factors surrounding that now but my point is that if somebody joins wow now, they aren't going to have those same feelings over old raids like tomb of sargeras or siege of orgrimmar even if they're good raids. i probably won't get to naxx or aq40 in classic and i'm okay with that.
---
that's a cool video btw, congrats on getting him down! i think the difficulty of that is understated and even if retail has more mechanics in a single boss fight, they are less punishing. you can argue til you're blue in the face about which one is ''harder'' but it's an objective fault that if you screw up one of the 10 mechanics dbm reads out to you your whole raid probably wont die like they do in vanilla
---
&gt;I don't have time for the pathetic children that think it's "fun" to camp low level zones on their 60s.
---
your pre-emptive level of butthurt at hypothetical situations makes me 100% sure that a pve realm is a better fit for you
---
As someone who never played Classic WoW but just from hearing from both sides This is my take away.  
---
1) Leveling Takes about 30 billion years (and I don't know about you but I think Leveling is the most boring obnoxious shit to ever exist in an MMORPG.)  
---
2) You had to walk LITERALLY EVERYWHERE (Even in retail it feels like it takes too long to get places. I'm here to play my damn dungeon not play walking simulator 2004)  
---
3) The Grind made the game near unplayable. (some people like slamming their face against a brick wall for 30 years just to get 1 thing, but yea that's just not for me)  
---
4) Classic WoW was much more of an RPG than retail. the biggest true RPG element in retail is the like 1 racial ability.  
---
5) Adds were actually a real danger in standard content. (Now This is just my opinion. But Throwing tanky and high damage adds at the players instead of complex and interesting mechanics to play around is just lazy game design and not worth playing)  
---
Basically. Fuck leveling. It's boring. The fun in pretty much every game that is in the MMO vein is in the end game content.   
---
Grinding isn't fun. Grinding is shit. Playing something repeatedly for a drop that has a stupid low drop rate or just having to do about a billion things to get what you want is just time-consuming and lazy design because they couldn't create something interesting. They just had to make it take forever.  
---
Travel. Yea fuck that. Hell even getting to another place in the Open world areas of Warframe with the crazy movement took too long. I got my Itzal Archwing which is the fastest for doing that. Still felt too slow.  
---
High HP pool and High Damage adds without special mechanics is lazy. And Lazy game design isn't worth funding.
---
A great example between these 2. Deadmines v.s. Shrine of Storms. Deadmines: Basically just DPS race everything.  Shrine of Storms: Adds with Buffing mechanics that you need to kick, Adds with special Armor buffs that your Priest can mass dispell, Adds with super high DOT effects that HAVE to be cleansed or they die in like 2 seconds. Every Boss has multiple special mechanics that have to be played around. Even the named adds have special mechanics. 
---
People like to shit on Retail WoW for so many things, but honestly. Retail WoW brings something to the table that Classic just doesn't Interesting mechanics. Not just "don't die and kill the enemy"
---
Classic has 2 things on Retail. Professions not being a joke. And a couple of RPG mechanics. That's really about it. and to be completely honest. If I was looking to play a true RPG I wouldn't play WoW (in any version) lol. It was never really an RPG. It was an MMO dungeon crawler with a couple of RPG mechanics. If you want to know what the real RPG experience is, then play Pathfinder (the table top, not the videogame) or Divinity (1&amp;2 are both good).
---
name checks out, yes dick smasher/ruin build  
---
I never played lock til tbc, so I never realized demon sac was a common build.
---
Don't worry, there won't be "progressive itemization".
---
Everything will be 1.12, no item will change properties over time. Blizzard will keep back certain powerful items (what exactly, to be decided by them) until certain content release phases. It should work out relatively nicely.
---
And really meant to be more tongue in cheek than anything else
---
I would say that coming across a wand early enough for wand spec on a fresh realm wilö be difficult so spirit tap might end up being more worth early. However I agree that wand spec is better for levelling speed 
---
Dick smasher/ruin...
---
This is the new name now.
---
Someone phone blizz, spread the word, tell your friends! 
---
It looked pretty dam cool though, much better than the within running.
---
And nothing stopping then from adding a mount as well.
---
However my intention was some levity rather than a serious suggestion for adding something removed in beta!
---
I was saying, and demonstrated, that the 'overpowered items changed over time' are not overpowered, and are merely competitive with other pre-existing options.
---
I then go on ,in this thread, to point out the 3 known items of major contention in the spell hit area because I was asked about spell stuff.
---
I can find you the list of 1-3 melee hit items too if you want?
---
There was also many items that were nerfed over time.  Should we bring them back in their OP states?
---
I'm sorry you feel this way but "pathetic children that think it's "fun" to camp low level zones on their 60s" *is* world PvP... :) (Yes, there are people who do other things but there will never be a PvP server where obnoxious assholes ganking is not the absolute majority of "PvP".)
---
&gt;/g Sorry guys, I'm gonna be 3 days behind you in getting 60 - need to get my Red Defias Mask from Westfall.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*Excortez has been kicked out from the guild.*
---
I love how people like you will literally make up stuff to fit your narrative. 
---
No corrupted blood, no living bomb pets, no vael bombs. This is obvious.
---
Most people bought gold to finance their mounts, that’s why gold farming was was such a huge problem, the WoW economy just plain sucked.
---
He'll feel really stupid when he realizes that all the hours he spent farming all that was completely pointless and that the content is easily completed without them. 
---
I mean ideally yea. But it probably won't happen.
---
It's about not having a completely static list of items in a changing game. Having some early items be good, having later items be buffed, that's what i want.
---
My point is that if you have 1 good item or 4, then having 4 is easier. 1.10 made it so that good items were way more abundant. Even if you prove that this one 1.7 item was as good as all of these 1.10 items, it still doesn''t take away the fact that in 1.10 items in general were better.
---
When you have 3 hours a day that's not really an option.
---
I realize that. But this is the best answer we can get for now.
---
My favorite by far is the second part of Maraudon that you acces through a portal.
---
Everything in this dungeon is amazing (for me), 
---
-The first "leap of faith" into the water while you see how BIG this whole thing is 
---
- The beauty and the collors 
---
- How vast and open it feels even while underground 
---
- the reaction of the newcommers when they finaly reach the 'princesse' of this stunning land :D
---
after 13 years of playing horde, i lately started playing a night elf for the first time
---
holy shit. the flight paths are a pain in the ass. i need so much time to think about a good flight and ship route.. 
---
High quality gameplay
---
Depends on what you mean by a WoW Killer.
---
If you mean actually kill retail to the point where its player numbers are too low to support Alliance v Horde and everyone just plays 1 faction to have people to play with..... then no. No chance classic does that.
---
Will classic Keep kicking? sure. but dont be surprised when you see huge numbers for the first month and then a 20-40% player numbers decline. I think it will probably be sitting somewhere around 60% of BDO's player base. 
---
Lesser magic wand, easily craftable with enchanting and usable at lvl 5. Also greater magic wand at lvl 13. I plan on buying these for my warlock at those levels, and crafting them myself if they are too expensive.
---
For design, BRD - so many different approaches you can take, elements to focus on.
---
For feel - scholomance or stratholme! Can’t decide which, but stratholme with the links to Warcraft 3 makes it for me.
---
Whilst levelling, I love ST and SM
---
Soemone is acting like a snowflake. Further your assuming alot there Baribe, do you not discuss possiblities of what can occur. God people like you on this thread are entitled jackasses.
---
Newsflash there Karen, Blizzard has a track recorder of messing things up and having to patch mistakes. So yes it's very possible with the release of Zul'Gurub it could happen. 
---
Further this is SPECULATION not fake shit to fit a narrative. 
---
That's right, they also said they were keeping current current client mail UI improvements
---
20 minutes of flight time :-/
---
Boy are you going to be disappointed when they announce August release date
---
It's those damn swoops!
---
Hmm. I want to say it was on the GCD, I think I have a memory of the GCD going off when I did it. But it was a long time ago.
---
The only game that ever felt similar to WoW to me was Rift. It was no WoW killer but it probably might have had the potential to become one. It was a great game in its early days. 
---
"It's all about the reward, not about the journey." 
---
There is place in classic wow for this mentality, don't get me wrong, but I hope this won't be the majority.
---
Really nice! Good mix of some theorycrafting and just general interesting opinions. 
---
I mean, it really depends. I was always avarage to bad at wow PvP and I always do not like the fact that it rarely is a fair fight (gear/level discrepancy, starting health pool) so a win is only partially made of skill.
---
For this reason I never liked to make others life miserable nor I like when someone decides that I don't get to play the game.
---
Pve servers are a blessing. There I can focus on the lore, on the story and on the dungeons while cooperating with other guys of the internet to achieve this goal. All without creating a toxic environment.
---
I mean, to me it's stressing enough the race to the mob tag in a overpopulated zone. Or some quests still gives me nightmares: those turtle scales in 1k needles....
---
Would be a shit guild if it does not help rogues getting a red defias mask anyway xd
---
Mages tend to not stack spirit either. 
---
You should innervate one of the healers, or save it up for when it's needed.
---
Chances are one of the priests or druids could always use the mana. Especially druids can just toss out some inefficient but powerful HoTs to the tanks and warlocks while under innervate to get most out of it.

Just shift-click their name in real life

If you weren’t a literal child and/or a moron, you’d realize corrupted blood wasn’t a bug, but a design flaw. It worked exactly how it was designed. They didn’t see the consequences of the design choices. After the incidents, they made the debuff dispel if you weren’t in the raid instance. There was no ‘bug in the source code’ 
---
It literally cannot happen again unless they specifically want it to. Your baby bitch ass would realize this if you weren’t ten years old. 
---
Go make some pewdiepie memes or whatever morons like you spend their time doing :) 
---
The retail analogy does not line up at all. Talk about a pre-baked reply. Try having a bloody thought from time to time.
---
If you want to experience bad itemization you can. No one is stopping you from tanking MC in a pink dress. My friend used to do just that in 2005. 
---
Classic isn’t for you. But there’s a reason why Activision is shite, and Classic is being made. Think about that for a moment.
---
I couldn't imagine being bad enough in any version of wow to ignore anything besides ilvl and primary stat, jesus christ this is a retarded hyperbolic post.
---
Lol you could tell if someone was a veteran on retail if they did this. It means nothing now so
---
It’s going to be awesome to say it and it feel like you accomplished something.
---
soon all comments and posts will be nsfw.
---
It can be, but a well-timed divine fervor+ &lt;insert big heal spell&gt; can save someone and have more effect than a cc that is broken so easily with AoE.
---
And well, any hybrid even in their most offensive variant is still supporty in nature. But there is a world between a supportive frontline bruiser (as any ret or prot variant geared as such is expected to work) and a full-fleshed backline healer-cleanser as holy is. 
---
it's exactly like saying if you want pre-nerf bosses then just be bad on purpose to make them harder. Or if you want flight paths to not be connected just only fly one trip at a time. Oh you want BG's to not be queueable in cities? Just walk there instead.
---
It's not up to the player to impose rules on themselves (and nobody else) when what they want is a shared ruleset for everyone. If you don't understand that then i really dont know what to say.
---
Its amazing how far Disc priest has come tbh, Vanilla Disc is barely any identity other than mages loved you for giving them PI heh.

No changes

There was a WoW peggle addon that let you play peggle in-game when you were waiting for something - it would automatically pop-up whenever you would fly and whenever you died but didn’t release (waiting for Rez) 
---
It was a full-fledged game, did not feel like an addon, and the niche thing was the addon version of the game included WoW-style talent trees for the peggle characters that the retail version of peggle did not have 
---
1) don't put words in my mouth, I never said the debuff was a bug. The plague was a result of a glitch.Congrats, you made yourself look like a dumbass. How about you get your facts straight before coming on your high horse. 
---
"The disease would also be passed on to other players who were simply standing in close proximity to an infected person. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul'Gurub instance but made its way into the outside world by way of hunter pets that contracted the disease.
---
The disease would eventually go away as time passed or when the infected character died. The only way that a player was able to bring the disease outside of Zul'Gurub was by allowing a pet to get the debuff, dismissing the pet in less than five seconds, then summoning it in a populated area. (When dismissed, the pet retains the debuff and the timer of the buff is paused.) It caused problems because hunters dismissed their pets after being infected, and brought them out later at the stable masters in large cities."

---
Your wrong in the total of your post. I will no longer reply to a troll who doesn't do research before opening his mouth. God you yougsters annoy me.
---
So from what I can see there is only 1 item that gained hit, and it was the Bloodmail boots, and at the same time, a ring lost the same amount of hit.  This is a net loss of hit.
---
So thats out of the way.
---
Now the AP set.
---
The Leather Scholo set gained 136 AP and lost 36str 23agi instead.  Ok looks kind of bad.
---
Belt was equaled by: http://itemization.info/item/11686  
---
The Legs by Devilsaur Legs or various other high agi/str options.
---
The gloves are rivaled by several green quest options.
---
Ergo, it does seem like blizzard is on the ball.  I assume the lack of finalization on the pvp timing is due fully to itemization concerns.
---
On pservers it does override. I personally go 3/3 even so, the extra slow on Blizzard makes it much easier to do the sort of AoE farming I’ve been doing - bears and chimeras in Winterspring.
---
Pffft, get outta here with your pserver lingo, no one said that in vanilla. 
---
Why wait til 40? WF totem is 32 iirc!
---
This is probably the case, and imo the best case.
---
I think blizzard might be trying to add 2 phases of pvp gear, based on their lack of timeframe.
---
It's fine, not everyone has to be at the top :) 
---
&gt; Getting to 60 on a pve server means nothing...might as well go play some offline single player game.
---
This. Also, on a PVP server the world feels more immersive and dangerous. PvE servers feel more like a tutorial mode to me. But that's just my preference.
---
I still haven't decided, I plan on playing a healer and I feel like being on a pvp would probably be more fun for dps characters. I won't be killing anyone, just on the receiving end mostly. But I do worry about pve servers being too boring.
---
wow, thx for the links i didn't even know such forums exist. 
---
he skipped earth totem quest though, which is not what you want to do for the actual run. 
---
also i did on a live Lightbringer server, which had lags. these guys doing it on on isolated local wow server with 0 ping which speed up thing massively and is unrealistic aswell. 
---
but ya thx again, thats what i wanted to see, if anyone is actually faster.
---
I look forward to playing 12 hours a day weekdays and 20 hours a day weekends. 
---
There is one change. After I hit rk14, I was so sick of pvp and like almost stopped pvping entirely.
---
I think post naxx blizzard should let you take the items after getting rk14 and upgrade with some ridiculous amount of honor. 500k to like give a piece a stat boast.
---
Well, then Broodlord (resistance focus) and Patchwerk (as the hateful soaker, due to overall higher armor and health) are quite good for druids. It's just that Jin'do's poly makes it quite more annoying on a warrior compared to a druid. 
---
That's true! And would you say it was better if they do it prior to 1.6 where you *need* the rank currently to have the pieces equiped or post 1.6 where you can derank and still use the pieces?
---
I would honestly prefer post 1.6.
---
If you don’t have a lot of time and want to focus on endgame PvE content, then PvE server.
---
If you can stand getting  ganked and being camped on your journey, then go for PvP.  Especially if you really enjoy that immersive aspect of the game.
---
I personally don’t have time to enjoy dealing with drawbacks of running to my warrior corpse when I just want to play the base PvE of the game.  I’ve burnt myself out on most PvP gaming in general anyways so I won’t be missing much.
---
Both shaman and warriors are effective at 'hamstring kiting' with slow 2handers. WF totem, earthbind + a fire totem depending on single target or aoe. You'll be set for life. Don't really need to go Resto while leveling.
---
I run a Roleplaying guild for Classic called [***The Argent Vanguard.***](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/a-h-rp-the-argent-vanguard-calls-to-arms-guild-recruitment/17723)  As the name suggests, we'll be an Argent Dawn themed RP guild. Whether you are looking to smite the wicked or spread the good word of the Holy Light, we aim to be every Argent Dawn roleplayers premier destination. 
---
Nothing wrong with that I hope you have a fun adventure. 
---
There will be Roleplaying servers. Just not ones with a PvP ruleset. 
---
I honestly wouldnt hamstring kite.
---
As soon as a warrior has a healer, he wants that sweet rage from getting hit by two mobs as the healer can throw a heal once in a while to keep the warrior topped off.
---
However I agree that enhancement is the way to go.
---
What the fuck, really?
---
Make sure to have your shaman heal in dungeon and grab all that sweet +spirit and +int gear. You will have the aggro anyways, so the enhancement shaman going with +int and +spirit does not gimp himself.
---
Go enhancement and never stop again.
---
Make sure that he grabs a 2hander as you will have the aggro most of the time, so he really does not need the survivability up until level 30-35 once you enter proper contested zones.
---
Oh no, big baby shat his pants, mom!! 
---
Completely agree with everything you said.
---
Warhammer online and Age of Conan. I recall both coming out around the same time about people thinking it would be a wow killer.
---
Great article, I did want to point out one fatal flaw tho.

"These arguments lead to fallacious conclusions and slippery slopes." When you said this I'm pretty sure you meant "phallacious," and in that case why not just use the slang word "cocklusions" instead of conclusions?

Holy priests are the best solo healers. And the best healers overalls. This thread is about what classes are low pop compared to demand. You won't have a prob finding groups as a holy priest. It will be easy af
---
Activision is shit because they (Like EA) are a publisher who doesn't care about their consumer or their development teams. (There is a reason Bungie told them to go fuck themselves) 
---
And Classic WoW is being made because they are certain that they will get a return on investment. They dont care if it lives or dies. all they care about is those first 6 months. Thats when they will make their money back. Its literally the same reason that they make shitty reboots. Cash cow. Easy Peasy. And that's Classic WoW. Ever thought about how the Classic wow Development went full steam around the same time that Activision started getting hands on with the company?
---
I still mourn the loss of what that game could have been. It had so much potential, but fell victim to EA
---
Warriors are very engaging with their mechanics. Despite what people say, I also found them one of the most fun classes to level as long as you don't slack on your gear. Getting one or two consumables (food buffs) off the auction house goes a LONG way as warrior too.
---
They don't care about it. They just want the e-peen of beating content and have the easiest time getting gear. They don't care about someone's fantasy or playstyle. If it's not optimal change your build to it, even if you hate it. 
---
They complain about selfishness but they react in a similar way.  
---
How does one get 876 gold by their 40s
---
It don't matter to Jesus!
---
Cash cow how? If there’s in game payments and stores with real money, the game will die. Cash cow because they will have millions more subscribers, but none of them will be paying hundreds of dollars for shitty pets and mounts and whatever else retail has going on right now.
---
The only question here is this; do we want Vanilla or do we want something different.

---
This is the real reason. I always make a habit when I discover astranaars flight path to run all the way and grab the fp just inside Azshara for this very reason. It connects Astranaar directly to ratchet without going around the world.
---
Yep, he doesn't have it. Hence the detour, lol.
---
Yea I don't think the 'choose your handicap' is ever very satisfying.  
---
The hoarding is also a non-issue outside of Nexus Crystals.
---
I think the main point here is that the power creep (there is at least some), is primarily in the dps area.  Raid DPS was never really the holding factor in classic.
---
The Barrens is Horde, not contested.
---
I read it, and I also agree with it. There will be guilds that get through the content without much hassle, but there will also be people/guilds that are used to having an easy ride have a big wake up call and not be able to progress. Also, I like that consumables are so important. It means you have to be prepared which adds the the experience.
---
Allies dont get those Jinth A'lor quests either right? Especially the one with the awesome 1% hit trinket and the other with the spellpower cape.... thats just wrong man.
---
Because the people who spend money in the cash shops on Retail arent going to play classic. Different groups of people.
---
Classic will drag back a bunch of old players who had cancelled their subscriptions and get a bunch of new subscriptions. you bet your ass there are going to be some subtle hints in classic to convince you to go play retail. 
---
The income from Retail will not be heavily impacted. Now think about the amount of people who will buy character boosts (if they offer them which im sure they will) on classic. 
---
"Gz" was 100% a thing in vanilla
---
The more popular being...
---
"Gzgz"

And...

"Gzgzgz"

And then you had...

"Gzzzzzzz"

I gained 11 stone playing Vanilla.

Do not challenge me.

I don't understand these downvotes 😂 I get what OP is going for but the way that this meme format works made him say literally the opposite of what he meant 
---
Wtf ofc we did. Pretends to be veteran but started during cataclysm 😂
---
I don't want Blizzard to change the game.
---
That said, if Blizzard were to change the game I'd be the last one to complain if they changed the PvP system. I love PvP but the time investment is simply put insanely unhealthy.
---
Yes the strongest slow takes precedence, aka an imp blizz will override a coc, and a coc will override frostbolt. Was like this in retail vanilla/tbc aswell.
---
Just look up yt videos
---
You realise that you have no way of confirming how official Classic will work, but in the same sentence you still claim that your explanation is somehow valid. That's some real cognitive dissonance.
---
xd
---
Can druids perform well in 1vx? If so in what way.
---
They buy it
---
Your story is similar to many others on privates. People grind to rank 14, burn out and quit the game for good. It's supposed to be fun during *and* after.
---
I think that WoW killed itself in the end. Now they are trying to revive it, by bringing back the best version of itself (which I'm excited for).
---
PvP.  PvP is the highlight of vanilla, no other version of the game has this greatness.  You will regret so much rolling on a pve server.
---
This is what happens when you break PVP Larry. 
---
Okay - I've never met anyone like that, that I can remember -  but I'm confident they exist. 
---
I'm hoping to play on a RP-PVP server. Just hope Blizzard actually facilitate this.
---
I got hooked on bejeweled by playing WoW...

yea man we have no idea, its such a mystery
---
Fear ward had a 30s cooldown in vanilla. 
---
It was upped to 3mins in BC.
---
Saves money too! Only reason you do the flight is if you're making food or other afk stuff.
---
BRD and Scholo I think. I like linear dungeons, where you're basically forced down a corridor, and Scholo was the best of those imo. But the sprawl of BRD is so cool that it probably gets the top spot anyway. Just the amount of events and stuff in there is pretty insane. Too bad you have no real reason to do most of the dungeon more than maybe once. And too bad boss design was pretty much not a thing, mechanically it's one of the most boring dungeons. I assume it was one of the first they made for the game. 
---
It’s actually both. People are speculating whether they hinted at something or not ;)
---
That's actually really cool!
---
You are actually delusional, dude. Character boosts? Classic players switching to Retail? Bro.... Get help. Seriously. 
---
Relax bro. It's just a video game we are talking about.
---
Adds who just do a lot of damage and have a lot of HP without any interesting mechanics that you have to play around is bad game design.
---
Look at the difference between Deadmines and Shrine of Storms. Deadmines is boring. just dps race everything. Shrine of storms has Mind control mechanics, Separation mechanics, etc.
---
Dead mines is a poorly design dungeon. Shrine of Storms is an amazingly designed dungeon. BFA mythic+ Dungeons are easily some of the most fun content in the game. and some of the most well designed.
---
Mechanically the game has just gotten better and better as the game has gone on. It went from basically just DPS races on everything to Almost every boss having some form of special mechanic. 
---
Just part of the challenge that comes with the experience. This is World of Warcraft.
---
I could be wrong, but is the phrase you're looking for "effective health?"
---
Play on a PvE server but keep yourself flagged for pvp. That way you have 2 options - turn it off if you start getting camped and just want to be left alone. Or turn it on an entice people to have a go at you!
---
Low level camping is quite rare, if somebody decides to camp you - log on to a alt and play there a short while, or take a break.
---
Your attitude is what makes it fun to camp you - just ignore the them.
---
Same thing is happening with all the battle royals 
---
NO MAN. YOU DON'T GET IT. THIS IS SERIOUS.  
---
^^^^/s
---
The bigger problem with the ranking system is account sharing, which can make the entire point of it moot and should be the number 1 thing blizz should look at.  
---
This is World of Warcraft for some people. For others it's something entirely different.
---
I'm saying it often. It's curious how the biggest "social" aspect of Classic is for many to make others life miserable trough Wolrd PvP.
---
I prefer and plan on playing pve server because in my experience most “world pvp” happens when you get jumped when half dead after combat or whilst still in combat. 
---
I didnt really enjoy the pvp side of the azuregos/green dragons and other world events. It just gets a bit frustrating. I can see why people enjoy that aspect but it’s just not for me. 
---
There are a lot of cool engineering thing that will make your life easier especially in PVP. The iron grenades stun your opponent for 3s, sprint boots, charge helmet etc
---
There's also the aoe tanking epic shield, and dynamite can help you generate aoe threat too.
---
You can always buy potions (will be expensive though) but you can't buy engineering.
---
If you have enough playtime to have a farming alt you could go miner + engineering on the warrior and herbs + alchemy on the alt. It's what I plan to do.
---
True but hunters in vanilla were included in radiator their skill usually.  Kiting mobs in BWL, trapping and adding a ton of utility.  A brain dead hunger would be a much bigger detriment to a guild than a grin dead priest or Pally
---
Your evidence was linking a boss from tbc. So you have like negative evidence.   
---
I admire your hustle nodrak, but sipher makes a lot of good points. If you weren't such a twaty contrarian I'm sure you could learn a lot from him.  
---
20 hour days? Is that a typo?
---
Oh yeah, it is the perfect complement to Rebirth!
---
Also, hmm, I know that's what it says on the tooltip, but I'm mostly sure the spell data on database sites means only natural, Spirit mana regen, and I'm very doubtful that MP5 effects are affected by anything, but we'll see this Summer.  I'll honestly keep it in mind to try it out.
---
Sadly the real money in skinning is about after lvl 40.
---
Wow killed itself a long, long time ago.  
---
   But wow might revive it, what a weird turn of events.
---
Lol you honestly think they wont have character boosts? It may not have been there originally, but I am sure they will add them. 
---
Also Lets break this down. Someone who hasn't played wow in a few expansions comes back for classic. Completes all the content in Classic. wants to scratch that wow itch. Starts playing Retail. its not that hard to imagine.
---
On top of that. Even if they dont have Character Boosts (which just wait. they will be there, even if the Dev team doesn't want it. This is Activision after all) Multibox shamans will be a thing. So they will get bonus money from that. 
---
If you think none of this will happen, Get help. Seriously.
---
That was painful.  
---
Wrong.. This is Wotlk. Check out the profession he got at under his minimap
---
Yeah, I figured Mages would have low Spirit, but I was wondering if there's a use for Innervate if healers don't need it.  Guess it should always be saved for some kind of strange emergency no matter what.
---
The best answer we can get is wherever the pserver got their answer from. In this case it's likely they have it right because there should be plenty of videos around showing debuff behavior. But it's better to talk about those videos instead when people are asking questions like these. Don't just assume pserver devs got it correct. 
---
No second monitor showing discord only, you are not ready my friend.
---
&gt; Trying to match old itemization will just confuse players.
---
What? We did it back in vanilla, we can do it again. Trying to not "confuse players" is how we ended up with retail's hand holding.
---
Probably an alt. This is likely taken during TBC as he has the 3.0.1 PTR patch on his desktop. 
---
At least I can make a chicken
---
There are a lot of videos showing exactly how they worked. 
---
&gt; The closest we’ve got is them admitting they’re using 1.12 data
---
"Closest"? It tells you everything you need to know. They stated at blizzcon that they literally _do not have_ all the pre-1.12 data, so there's absolutely no reason to assume there'll be any kind of progressive itemization unless they explicitly say otherwise.
---
I think achievements would be cool IF you couldn’t link them in chat and no other players could see them. They were just for your records. 
---
Yeah we will just add a ridiculous tax to counter the tip
---
Lets be real here. The only real content in WoW is the Dungeons and Raids. Questing? lol. Questing is a waste of time that exists purely for leveling. Which leveling again is a waste of time. It Exists purely to either A: Get you to buy a character boost. Or B: waste a month of subscription before you get to the end game content where the fun is.
---
Raids and Dungeons are really the only content that is fun to play. Everything else exists purely as an obnoxious sidetrack that you are forced to do.
---
We can see the insecurity on you dutch boy
---
I'm completely relaxed, and thank you for conceding. It was becoming awkward.
---
dude dafuq everyone dinged in vanilla xD

&gt; We don't know for sure how official Classic will work.

Can't cure your stupid, sorry.

I want to play a warlock on the alliance site. I don’t like gnome so i will play human. Do i really have that Big disadvantage because im not an orc or gnome? I want to play wpvp and bg‘s in a normal „Rating“

This thread is literally asking if 3/3 imp blizz overrides CoC and you say we cant know for sure, are you this willfully ignorant to everything in life? In this regard we know exactly how classic will work because we have retail evidence.
---
Release date for the video???
---
Just casually stalking him in the shadows, watching them play through their window... 
---
There will be plenty of such guilds. Also if you can get yourself in a meaningful role in the guild, you can have a say on what times could be good for raiding.
---
Hunters are good for PVP, yes and they're not as much gear dependent as a warrior.
---
If I was you, I would farm (a lot) and buy a few MC runs from a hardcore PVE guild to get the ancient leaf from Majordomo. I think the drop rate is something like 30% and once their hunters got it, it's no use to them anymore.

It will pop a quest and the final reward will be [http://classicdb.ch/?item=18713](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18713)
---
inb4 activison pulls a sneaky on ya and offers character boosts.
---
Azshara is level 20? Someone's been playing too much retail
---
Not pointless at all.
---
Use consumables &gt; get invited into a better guild &gt; clear content faster &gt; get geared faster.
---
Good luck fighting that AQ40 geared rogue while you're still stuck on Nef.
---
If you started at 6 and ended at 9, you would be missing dinner with your family. That's a homewrecker right there
---
I'm not sure how I can disagree more with you. Leveling is a an essential core part of any RPG and MMO. It provides the sense of progression. It is also to serve as a learning curve for the average player to better understand his class, the game dynamics, game areas and last but not least, lore.
---
If we were to compare leveling 1-60 in Vanilla and 1-120 in retail... Well, we can't. What I said above is valid for 1-60 in Vanilla. But what *you* said is also valid for current 1-120.
---
If I was to level a new toon on retail right now, of course I'll see it as an obnoxious chore which is simply a time gate before I can reach the 'end game'.
---
But in Vanilla WoW, the journey to 60 was a very fun experience in of itself.
---
People need to understand that if they want to play Classic, they really need to take everything they know about retail WoW and throw it out the window. It is a completely different game which caters to a completely different crowd.
---
Pretty much, that cave in night elf starting zone with those spiders were rough. One second i was inside and alive, the next second i was outside and dead 🤣
---
The consensus is the top 1% of guilds will not take you.. you probably wouldn’t want to play with them anyways.
---
Otherwise, you will be slightly gimped but you can make up for it with being extra studious and learning your class well, grinding consumables, etc. Overall, I’d say being a slightly less than optimal race is worth it if you can’t stand a certain aesthetic or lore. You don’t wanna level to 60 and realize you hate your midget body.
---
If we all listened to the tryhards, we would all be orc warrior/lock/hunter, gnome mages, and dwarf priests. Druids wouldn’t even exist.
---
Do as you will, a grand adventure awaits :D
---
Are you going to rush to 60? If not, maybe level them simultaneously?  It would suck to level one, regret it, then do another 60 levels to start off your classic experience.
---
Both classes are fun and good in pvp, but druid will never be a one man wrecking ball the way mage can.  Do you care about logs?  Any healing class can top the meters.  Mage isn't very likely to do that without an advantage.  
---
These are the things I'm considering at least and probably why I'm going to pick a mage.  I most recently played a resto shaman and felt like pvp was a waste of time, but in a raid I was a carry.  Now I'm choosing the opposite, because I want to feel powerful in pvp. :D
---
You just solved LotRs biggest plot hole.
---
hey thats me
---
It's mainly an EU thing instead of a US thing.
---
What's it like to heal in a raid ?
---
I had an alt priest in Vanilla, I enjoyed healing a lot in dungeons and PVP but I always thought 40 life bars would freak me out !
---
Are you responsible for the whole raid or you just have a group of 5 to take care of ?
---
Classic Wow was never really meant to be fair so things like premades stomping on people is just par for the course, similar to a T3 geared DPS instant killing a guy in dungeon blues.  I never really ran into this issue as I was usually only queueing with guildies(not R14 grind) and by TBC when I did solo queue mostly I was insanely overgeared so I didnt pay much attention to who I was deleting(win or lose). Usually for both WSG and AB a premade vs non-premade is at least over mercifully quick.  The only problem is with non-crossrealm you will probably just get rematched right after.
---
Note:  We don't know if we are getting crossrealm BGs do we?  With crossrealm I feel like it happened less but that could also be because R14 was pretty old by the time crossrealms came out.
---
I wouldn't be too pesimistic about it until they actually release the realm list. The community has been very vocal about this issue and the Classic dev teams seems to listen to us.
---
We don't know for sure how it will work, because we can't see the future. Whether it's correct or not is besides the point. It's embarrasing I had to spell it out for you like this, but I'm sure you're used to it. Just know that it made me extremely uncomfortable.
---
I'm in the same boat as you in a way, with the NA raids times.  I work 3rd shift and need to leave my house by 2200, so raid needs to end by 2100 so I can get ready.  I think I'm going to be forced in to trying to raid when I get home from work some time after 0700. I've actually given very hard consideration in just playing on EU realms even though I'm east coast NA. The struggle is so real, and with classic around the corner I'm started to stress about it 
---
^ this 
---
Totally overlooked the idea of this.. 
---
Find a guild in an earlier time zone?
---
Paladin T2 set, how attainable is it for a casual? I work till 5pm-ish every weekday plus Saturday if needed(sometimes even 7pm, I’m a self employed contractor so work has gotta get done), so let’s say I can on average play for a couple hours most days, and some intense 6 hour grinds on the weekend if I’m up for it. Am I gonna ever see that t2 set? What are some alternatives?
---
I'm in the same boat as you.
---
In France they start raiding at 9pm until midnight or later.
---
I can be IG from 6 to 10pm but later than that it's going to affect work the next day.
---
I never found a French guild that had the same timing than me.
---
Yeah, it could definitely be the same on both sides of the pond. Could maybe have skipped "Europe" in the title.
---
Most people will want to get home after work and do some things before raiding. 17:30 would be way too early for them.
---
Still, keep looking and perhaps create a guild if you don't find any.
---
Bad sarcasm?
---
Maraudon because it felt like more than a dungeon the first time I ran it. It felt like a whole new world I was exploring, especially the later parts. Running in circles, jumping, and falling. I was so lost the first time and knew I couldn't walk back to the entrance if I tried but that made it feel so much more epic. 
---
There’s usually weekend raiding guilds. If you can commit to two 4 hour raid nights a week I think you’ll have no trouble clearing bwl and more.
---
Yeah it was a pretty bad system but a change to it would have to be pretty big, and goes against recreating the feel of vanilla. I think it actually worked well at low levels, it’s just blizzard never expected people to play for insane amounts of hours. 
---
Mac user here. Guess I‘ll not use that tool. 
---
Which actually makes me wonder how many people will play Classic on a Mac. I guess there have been no polls on that.. 
---
Yes but think about the players that love PVP but don't want to raid and can't be R14. They will never get good enough gear to compete with the raiders.
---
I am CET. IDK how far east I could go while still having people speak decent english and being open to having many nationalities in the guild.
---
Shit you're really digging yourself deeper aren't you 
---
The same goes for Norway, there’s still a meter of snow left even though the suns been kind enough these past weeks. 
---
That is totally understandable, but I don't see how they would all be concerned with that kind of stuff in the evening, but still have no trouble being underslept for work the next day.
---
Wait....you can make food and other stuff while on a flight?
---
depends we used to have tank healers and group healers, usually 1 healer a group and 1 dedicated to tank and offtank
---
just make sure you ask whats expected of you and ull have a great time
---
Nice, thanks for the reassurance. That much I can definitely sacrifice.
---
I did snakes/turtles in Mara from 45-51 (?) or whatever time you usually start lasher farming on a fairly popular pserver. Some things to note -
---
- It's a little rough at levels 45-47 as you get misses and can't pull large groups. 
---
- make sure you get leatherworking to make some  very nice gold
---
- if you don't have invisibility potions, I'm not even really sure it's doable early as solo killing the hydra is hard, even though it's soloable, and it will kill you very fast if it gets in range at all.
---
- i really liked it for leveling though, good cash and leveling speed
---
I think ranks should never had rewards to them.
---
They should be the title of a very dedicated PVP player that's it. So people would not have spent 18 hours per day in BGs.
---
The gear should have be obtainable from a kind of faction grind so that a hardcore player can get it in 6 months and a casual in 2 years (but still get it).
---
It would have been much more healthy this way.
---
But first I need a mouse :( 🐭 🍑 
---
Finishing the raid at 11-12 isn't that late imo. If you got a 9-5 job or even 7-4
---
You're not raiding every single night, just a couple times each week.
---
Yes I remember this. It sucked to have to land and go to the next place manually. This was a welcome addition
---
You can't start raiding the moment you walk into your house most people want to rest a bit so 19:00 is reasonable time to start raiding 
---
It's not late, you're just early 
---
I was ready until my gfx card pooped out. Hopefully I have time to save up before release.
---
Not gonna totally rule out creating a guild that suits my timings, and then see if other people would like the same. I'm not super experienced on guild leadership, and there are also a lot of classes and raid encounters I know little about, but creating an open atmosphere and recruiting other leaders who could fill out my weaknesses it could work.
---
"What's that? A new Fortnite update?"
---
Blackrock Depths. Because it really feels like a city of dark irons, not just loot corridors. All newer dungeons are just made for convenience of players. 
---
Is that really normal in the rest of Europe? Here, it seems most employers have you inn at 07.30, and then you're done at 15.00 or so.
---
&gt; Whether it's correct or not is besides the point.
---
So you're suggesting they will change vanilla class mechanics just because they can? Or for fun? It would have been much easier to admit you made a mistake and move on man.
---
&gt; Just know that it made me extremely uncomfortable.
---
Yikes.
---
Way too many Ron-flakes in this cat's diet.  
---
It might not be honestly. From what I have understood the grind could be that insane, it's based off of relative performance so it can get out of control if everyone else is playing a lot.
---
If I remember correctly only the first part of it is low level. Once you venture out it goes high level. It's been so long
---
Such is life.  
---
There are winners and there are losers.  
---
Dude, just ignore those guys. They are a vocal minority, that scream on a subreddit. You'll find people to play with and clear endgame content with in your favorite spec, don't worry.
---
This is the reason why I hate those guys, even though I myself don't care about what they say.
---
We never tell them what they should do, just that people in wow, a game, can do anything they want. In the other hand they scare people by saying minmax is the only way and you're damned if you disagree.
---
Just fuck them. Really.
---
Yeah this is how I imagined it being too
---
But is it really normal to start at work at 9? It seems really late. Here it is normal to work 07.00 or 07.30 to something like 15.00.
---
Sounds like a crap system.  
---
Looks like a NE Feral Druid haha
---
That is correct, there is an opportunity cost attached to it. I still deem it more efficient to actually use the food while leveling for the powerful buffs instead of just buying food while leveling and then buying the food on the AH once you are 60 to get up the skill.
---
You could start one and advertise. That way you can get people on similar playtime on one server.
---
Pingfu did the job for me when I was studying abroad
---
Ty!
---
Friend of mine hit R14 then quit on the popular pserver lol.  
---
Dont solo queue
---
It might be not as bad as other classes but as a flag carrier, it became the most boring thing I could ever do.
---
95% people will be more concerned with how geared you are rather than what race you are. The other 5% of the time they will be concerned with your skill level. 
---
If you finished a raid at 11 and went to sleep immediately you would have about 7 hours of sleep. That's pretty good isn't it?
---
Most jobs in my industry are something like 8.30 to 4.30 in the uk where I live. Maybe 8-5 mon-thurs and a 12.30 finish on Friday if your with a good company. 
---
Embrace the lag as part of the legacy wow experience!
---
What if said skeptic played vanilla on release.... hey but I'm happy to grab popcorn and watch this go down. This is free entertainment for me.
---
First. WoW is not an RPG (I know I know I know, Its in the name MMORPG. Its not an RPG. one session at a D&amp;D table will confirm that for you) WoW is an MMO. 
---
Second. The "Sense of Progression" is a buzz word for "Please give me some way to justify this massive waste of time". Now the learning curve is actually a legitimate argument. But I still believe the best way to learn in any game is to be thrown into the fire immediately. I played CSGO for 2 years. Was a silver player. 2 months of playing custom against people better than me in every way. I learned pretty quick. Getting thrown in the deep end immediately is the best way to improve and learn.
---
Leveling being a fun experience? Yea I'm not so sure on that one. I've probably played 10-15 or so MMOs. Literally never has leveling been anything more than a chore. I dont mind gearing. Its playing a game without all your abilities that is boring. Pressing 1-4 keys for 20 hours is really not fun in the slightest. The fun in an MMO comes from being able to utilize your full kit. When you dont have that full kit its not fun.
---
The closest Ive ever had to enjoying leveling was Blade &amp; Soul. And really it came down to 2 things. It was visually stunning and yea..... you really needed to learn your shit. In WoW (maybe its because I only play healers) You really dont need to go through a slow leveling phase to learn your character. You just need to sit down for like 2 hours with the full kit to get an understanding for it and then you will gradually become more comfortable with it. B&amp;S.......... I leveled an assassin and im going to be honest. I wasn't entirely sure wtf was going on half the time. The sheer amount of combos and abilities that can be cast with no cooldown if you have already cast something else or abilities that require you to cast other abilities in a certain order with a certain timing to even be able to cast them is pretty intense. WoW is a very simplistic MMO that doesn't need a really long leveling phase to learn.
---
Depends on your job. But here in England most people start work around 8-9 I think. 
---
When you think about it, blizzard casualized the game by removing meaning from various systems, that in turn being done by removing a possibility of failure:
---
- Leveling became meaningless, you can no longer fail at attaining max level.
---
- Items became meaningless, you can no longer fail at attaining purples/legendaries/artifacts/whatever they come up with next.
---
- Professions became meaningless, you can no longer fail at picking wrong profession because only alchemy seems to matter anyway.
---
- World became meaningless, almost every location is easy to traverse and you dont need to concern yourself with anything but travelling in straight lines, even without flying.
---
- iLvL is becoming increasingly obsolete, you now just sink more time and eventually rng will throw titanforges at you.
---
- Rep grinds became meaningless; on one hand, you get to around half-way to revered without effort, on the other they never end anymore.
---
- Quests are meaningless, they no longer facilitate your questing route or grouping with others, pulling you on a string.
---
- Combat in world is meaningless, too. You can't really fail pulling one, two, three mobs.
---
I recently did a quest on retail where I had to "protect" an npc from Big Bad Dude. I took big bad down to 90% hp and got a doorcall. I picked up the mail and cooked something quick and returned a whole 15 (FIFTEEN) minutes of afk later to see the NPC lost 1% hp, and I lost 9%. 
---
Nothing matters on retail.
---
You're missing the point entirely.
---
Why should all of WoW Classic PvP be what is essentially Rated Battlegrounds with no class tuning and no matchmaking?
---
Cross-realm BGs would be a huge issue for the Vanilla Honor System. Highly doubt that is going to happen.
---
Hello buddy.  My question is, are we gonna have some sort of a quest helper in classic??  ty in advance :)
---
Hi, /u/Sawyermblack
---
What isn't at this point? Summer 2019 when?
---
IRL food.
---
How good can i farm with a shadow priest? 
---
Skilled 0/3/48?
---
I personally tailor my leveling routes to professions instead of questing guides or profession guides. Yes, you need to grind here and there and there aren't any internet resources that will guide you through perfectly.
---
The goal is always to get to 225 skill when you reach about lvl 35. For cooking specifically you don't need to grind all that much, just a couple of minutes here and there. The cooking meats you need to skill up are very much available to you.
---
For horde cooking you can do it roughly like this:
---
1. Durotar Boars
---
2. Crossroads Tailstriders
---
3. Southern Barrens Thunder Lizards
---
4. Stonetalon Thunder Lizards &amp; Stags OR Ashenvale Stags OR Hillsbrad Bears &amp; Lions
---
5. Arathi Raptors (for both Eggs and Flesh)
---
6. Stranglethorn Raptors &amp; Tigers
---
7. lvl 35 Cooking quest
---
8. Tender Wolf Meat &amp; Monster Ommelette from basically any 40-60 zone.
---
As you can see all of these beasts are heavily tied into the appropriate leveling zones and all of them have kill/gathering quests for these zones attached to them. You only kill a few extra.
---
If you level fishing alongside cooking you don't need to grind at all.
---
Yeah, base hearth is 15 minutes and you can get that to 9 with a choice you will want to make, and there's a ring you will want to get with its own 30 minute hearth that requires no raiding, just a bit of grinding
---
the zones are really small, and most of the roads, let alone other areas, are packed with enemies 
---
https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
when the warchief drinks wrong polyjuice
---
Let's hope not.  There's always quest helper addons.  
---
I'd like at least 60 minutes between raid end and hitting the sack. I'm afraid falling asleep fast isn't my strong suit :/
---
Waow someone didn't use flawless grammar and sentence structure on the internet grr
---
Ay mate, eastern european here, I'm pretty much limited to 22-02 raiding hours, judging by all the UK and German guilds recruiting, hope i'll find some fellow slavs with better time zones.
---
Who named the two islands Kalimidor and Eastern Kingdoms?   
---
The horde see duskwood as duskwood and the alliance also see duskwood as duskwood?   
---
Did horde characters get together with Alliance and decide on the names? Who knows? 
---
&gt;only the first part of it is low level.
---
the flightmaster, to be specific. And also a few low-level mobs - but, if you got to the flightmaster, you would surely make it to the level ?? mobs.
---
So anyone in retail will have: 8 hearths per hour
---
3 Dalaran hearths per hour with portals to most places
---
3 garrison (WOD) hearths per hour, plus a 4 hour hearth. portals to most places
---
I've seen this kind of comment before, I leveled as shadow both in vanilla and more recently on unofficial servers. Why is holy priest faster?
---
Not at all, but what am I going to do about stupid people ganging up on me? I made one attempt, that's all I'll do.
---
no they dont. rogues are strong pvpers, just not in every aspect.
---
with their huge CD toolkit they are one of the best duelling classes and their ability to pick and choose fights makes them strong in world pvp too.
---
now for casual and especially premade battlegrounds there are definately classes that shine a lot more here but they can find their niche.
---
Try reading it again, or perhaps multiple times. With any luck, you'll understand it some day. Good luck, kiddo.
---
What time zone are you inn?
---
This won't exist in classic fortunately. Cross faction collaboration is forbidden.
---
Sub-par rogues are hard to beat as a skilled player. 
---
Premade vs Premade could last hours
---
With enough weed and mountain dew this victory could be an almost sexual experience
---
See the world, they said... 
---
It will be fun, they said...
---
And here I was planning on rolling an orc lock. 
---
Last weekend, WoW had that promotion that you could come back to the game and try it for a weekend, so I downloaded it and logged into my character - for the first time since 2006.
---
Naturally I checked /played and apparently it took me 13 (!!!) days to reach lvl 60 and that was on a PvE-server. Holy hell, didn't realise I was that slow.
---
well as long as something exists, its all fine by me!  what about cross-realms? I rly hope not...
---
Yes my guild Lakeshire Guard is themed. But whether it's pvp or rp-pvp is up for discussion. And the RP would only be for the world pvp and hanging out within Redridge, casual rp.
---
Are you suggesting that a solo queuer should be on an even playing field while ranking to a member of a successful organsised team?
---
Ofc the dedicated team should have an advantage, just as the 40 man raider should have better gear than the guildless solo quester.
---
It's an mmorpg. Get in a team.
---
My sweet summer child
---
"Waste time"? I love doing open PvP. For me it is fun and exciting and the reason I choose a PvP server. I probably wouldn't even play WoW at all if there was no PvP server option. Speak for yourself!
---
Speechless
---
Are there going to be any RP realms?! 
---
Full Maraudon run like 4.5 hours minimum.
---
I meant in regards to Americans, my bad! 
---
"For those unfamiliar, Premade vs Premade could last hours (no timer in Vanilla) while PuGs are efficiently farmed for honor which is necessary to climb ranks."
---
I dont know what you are talking about, premades want a quick win. farming GY's is shit honor /hr
---
I'm very much #nochanges on this one
---
you come for nostalgia you stay for the community 
---
That's a quick way to make vanilla private servers relevant
---
Him and Madseason. 
---
Looks like an Orc from Elder Scrolls
---
Was post and auction house post instant in 1.12?
---
If the fight needs more DPS because of some enrage (more frequent on higher tiers) then yeah, innervate the DPS, locks or mages.
---
I loved my Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon card back then, although not that powerful, it gave me a good trinket to use until i started serious raiding.
---
I forget. Did Un'Goro have a mailbox?
---
Lol, they farm GY while their druid runs 3 flags. You're clueless.
---
Funny how truth about vanilla raiding being easy is so hard to swallow :) 
---
I loved rift when it released. I played a warrior tank and really enjoyed the first 2 raid dungeons. I quit shortly after the 3rd came out, as my enjoyment had burned out fairly quickly. 
---
Irl food. You can’t cook your gryphon. 
---
That's honestly really good. I wouldn't call it slow at all. If it was your first 60 that's quite fast. 
---
I took roughly 27 days played to hit 60. But it was a great 27 days played. 
---
I'm suggesting that he gets solo Q'd into a random team rather than have 10 geared and experienced players standing at a graveyard while their druid runs flags.
---
No they are very powerful in PvP.
---
In the open world they are still the best duelists along with Druids and Hunters.
---
In organized BGs and open world premades they are used for their strength: Defending flags, backcapping, hunting down respawns, scouting etc.
---
They are simply the best at being Rogues and nobody can do what they can do. However they kind of suck in big zergs. A Rogue who knows their strengths and weaknesses will always do very well.
---
.......close enough

Done at 15? Where do you live? Most countries have a 8 hour workday which may or may not include an hour's lunch. Something like 8-9 to 17 is pretty standard.
---
Are there any clear cut, hard and fast rules, as to when to use a battle rez as a Druid in a raid? 
---
Chicken.
---
Shakespeare's corpse just had an orgasm.
---
It is that hard to imagine. You haven’t even played Vanilla. Why are you talking as if you have any idea? I’ve played retail. I quit because it sucked, and was only beginning to suck harder. 5 years later I’m correct.
---
GMT +3, feels bad man
---
People prefer you to hold it for tanks and healers. But you will be the best judge of using it. Keep in mind there is also Soul Stone from Warlocks. Each player or class might have an important role in a specific fight. Also I typically wouldn't use it on players that just "fuck up", because chances are they will again and if you rez them they won't learn it.
---
So it's premade vs premade, solo vs solo. Dont you see that would cause an issue where it might be advantageous in a purely honor/h context to solo queue instead of assembling a team and coordinating over voice comms?
---
Do you understand why that is a worse situation than someone who refuses to participate in a team getting beaten soundly?
---
I remember grinding pvp a lot back in vanilla to get to the high ranks.
---
As soon as i was done at work, straight home and on the grind. I only managed to hit R11 and felt that R14 was impossible.
---
We had a NE hunter hit R14 on our server and it was later discovered he had been letting multiple ppl play his account almost 24/7.
---
So this time, if i see another R14 im just gonna assume they either a) is being boosted or b) they seriously have no life cuz no way in hell you can get to R14 with a normal job (or gf/wife for that matter)
---
My point is, don't worry about it, R10 should be possible for a normal player if they put some effort in and there at least you get the first set of pvp gear to use.
---
30 minute q penalty for dodging problem solved
---
BWL can be cleared by the most casual guilds given time. It is only AQ40 and Naxx that require heavy consumables, gearing and preparation. All the other raids require some specific stuff but it isn't even comparable.
---
So yes, given time and a nice fitting guild, you will wear your precious, cool looking T2 set at some point :)
---
Hmm.  
---
I guess what I just built was probably overkill then.  
---
Why the fly go through ThunderBluff then?
---
Too bad it didn't make into the game
---
I certainly hope your right. 
---
We don't really know how good tech Blizzard has at discovering account-sharing these days. Hopefully they will be able to catch the majority.
---
Boosting services is something I fear in general. I hate retail chat when you read boosts for HC raid clears. But I'll just block anyone who spams those things in Classic.
---
U couldn't share account now, blizzard detect it instantly 
---
My Vanilla server literally did it all the time. It was great.
---
You can be both right, *and* an unpleasant asshole at the same time, you know?
---
Healers are mostly divided by tank healers and raid healers. The raid healers are looking at the 40 grid.
---
Also keep in mind that you will learn the encounters and your teammates with time. A good healer knows who will take damage and when, almost before it happens with experience and just by looking at the actual screen.
---
Why are there ads for a platinum credit card? What is this sorcery?
---
That looks like a ret paladin.
---
Generally just save it until a raid leader calls for it. Eventually you may know situations where you are just going to want to fire it of asap, but that's going to depend on the fight, the situation, the raid makeup and a ton of other stuff. If you're not sure it's better to save it.
---
They're literally recreating vanilla and there's evidence this is how it works.. What's your argument? That they might forget to do it?
---
Gotta love that they made several parts of the game pay to win.......Or not.
---
Looooool
---
they farm GY for 3 mins max?    they don't sit farming GY for hours. 
---
unrelated to the honor farming, but you getting personal and trying to insult me after just one post - you are acting like a child. people wont listen to your arguments if you come off as petty.
---
I love this whole "retail wow is bad" circle jerk. I am not sure you actually played retail. Now I'm giving my reasons for what I believe are classic wows issues. And also why I think retail is a better product. 
---
And don't give me that "there is no community" bs. No one ever provides a clear cut reason from a gameplay and mechanical position on why they believe it is better. Because mechanically WoW has only improved. Just look at the bosses in mythic+ bfa vs classic wow bosses. They just don't compare.
---
&gt; The consensus is the top 1% of guilds will not take you..
---
I never heard of any guild not taking someone because of their race choice. Good players just gravitate towards eachother based on how they play, not based on their race choice.
---
&gt; If we all listened to the tryhards, we would all be orc warrior/lock/hunter/rogue, gnome mages, and dwarf priests. Druids wouldn’t even exist.
---
That is some serious misinformation in many regards.
---
This would be perfect for me if you decided to play on a PvP-server instead
---
Agree with all these points. The game is so soft-core casual that it's no longer rewarding. Instant gratification on almost everything. it's more like a single player game with godmode on.
---
Blizzard didn't expect people to play for insane amount of hours? Cmon man most of them wanted to build an MMO because they loved MMOs and the grinding and the accomplishments. They 100% knew that their PvP design would mean that only the true neckbeards would be able to achive the highest ranks. 
---
I'd really like to raid weekends instead. Like early saturday/sunday raids would be great.
---
Raiding on a week day is just exhausting to me. You can't do anything else that day, it just consumes your whole night. I'd love it if there was a guild who raided at 10am on a sunday. Just wake up, raid MC for a few hours and relax for the rest of the day. Raiding when i have to get up in the morning is just stressful.
---
But i'm with you in that I don't like how raids end at 23:00 or 00:00. That's super late, and by the time i get ready for bed at watch an episode or something i'm going to sleep at like 1 am.
---
WHY IS THERE NO RELEASE DATE YET
---
If I we're an elf id take mt chances with a bunch of flower pickin Taurens over a bunch of bloodthirsty Orcs. 
---
Depends on the fight and raid makeup. There may be fights where you're just healing the whole raid, but that would be on fights with not a ton of raid damage. If there's a lot of damage going around assignments will usually be more specific.
---
Dude, 13 days to reach 60 in vanilla isn't that bad at all. 
---
Does anyone go to sleep immediately after finishing a raid?
---
Like first of all it would take me at least 15mins to just hearth back, check the auction house, say goodbye to people, you know, all that. Then get ready for bed takes maybe 5mins. And i can't just sleep as i hit the bed, i need to watch something first. Is it normal to just go to sleep right away?
---
So this is what gettinf your post reposted feels like. At least you added the bottom image.
---
I'm a Brit but work in GMT+3 (GMT+4 sometimes cos no daylights saving) I'm in the same boat
---
I think vanilla was a great game but there is also strong nostalgia. It has both factors going for it and people who buy into both of them are the people who are going to get the most out of the game. I think talking about these things here is kind of an echo chamber, where its really hard to say how it will be actually received, which only time will tell. Personally it is about nostalgia for warcraft universe (from wc3 to tbc), which just is a complete different thing thematically atm. Everyone has ridiculous looking mounts and taurens are paladin and all that, and the original experience is hard to come by. What gets me most hyped for classic is that its basically game that hasn't existed for a long time now. Sure there are private realms but everyone of those have their own quirks that make it somewhat different in slight ways, which I'm not a fan of (but hey, thats the best we'v had for a long time). I so so hope that this classic will stick around so 10 years from now I can log on and enjoy some classic, similarly to what I can, say Diablo 2 or Morrowind.

You can actually collect and wear all the gear that Stormwind Guards wear. That always looks impressive.
---
Hitting 60: DONG!!
---
Gzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!
---
Sorry, PVE all the way.
---
I'm gonna get a windows computer for the first time to play hope I don't have to spend too much haha
---
Weekend raids are great, when I have the time for it. I think I'd rather not commit to filling the weekend with raiding though, since a lot of other stuff also happens during weekends taht I'd like to go to. But yeah, if I have an entire saturday or sunday, I could see myself spending 8+ hours raiding if it worked out that way.
---
Hope you find what you're looking for.
---
Untrue.
---
I don't really do anything on 10am on a sunday anyways, ever. I'm more likely to have some event going on at 9 pm on a wednesday than i am at 10am sunday.
---
Sadly i wont find what i'm looking for haha.
---
It doesn't even need to be account sharing. A big enough PvP guild can usurp all rank 14s on your server and unless you pay them, they won't let you get it. Better pick a less known realm if you wanna go for PvP ranks alone.
---
If memory serves me correctly they said they were going to keep the modern iteration of the mail system. So I expect it will be the same as it is on retail. Which is fine to be honest, it doesn't effect too much.
---
Well that and the eagles are sentient beings that would have to come to the decision to fly there and not just do so at the whim of a wizard or hobbit. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't the eye of sauron powerful enough to kill the eagles outright and once the ring was destroyed so was the eye of sauron?
---
If my memory is correct it wasnt till much later that mail became instant. Classic was a 1 hour delay afaik
---
I remember this one. I like that it's subtle but you really get that warrior feeling
---
Too bad the warrior tier 3 set they got was a death knight set
---
I tried several times with friends and it was not possible due to us logging from different locations
---
 **Will be playing in Japan, any suggestions?**
---
Sure. Beware of Cataclysm. :)
---
Blackrock Depths: The maze design just blew me away. The Molten Core attunement. Honestly still today I don't understand all the ins and outs of the dungeon and I can't wait to go back and explore and understand all the mysteries.
---
Sunken Temple: I loved the theme of ST. More importantly I understood the layout better than most people, so I would always be the dungeon guide for the group.
---
Wailing Caverns: Being an altoholic and 90% of those alts being Horde I ran ALOT of Wailing Caverns. Having played a bit of undocumented server lately, entering that dungeon was exactly going 15 years back in time and remembering every little thing about the place.
---
Yeah how dare people ask the class with utility to utilize their summon! If you roll a warlock you’re gonna be summoning. Accept your fate. This is akin to a mage refusing to give people water because it’s annoying to make it and trade it off. And especially in classic where time management and efficiency is important you better believe if I see a warlock get invited to the group and I’m out questing in another zone I’m gonna wait for the warlock to get there and summon me so I can squeeze out more exp in the downtime. 
---

Na, play what you want. The racials are useful, but not worth worrying about in the long run. Play what you enjoy and you will perform much better than something you don't enjoy.
---
I guess so. Unless I am traveling for an event, I'm pretty much never doing anything saturday and sunday morning and afternoon.
---
Doesn't make any money? Oh, you poor deluded fool. There's lots of money in enchanting. The trick is to not sell the enchants, but to sell the mats instead. Note that the auction house charges a deposit based upon a percentage of the vendor value for the item being auctioned. And that the vendor price for enchanting mats is zero. So you can put them up for auction as many times as needed until they finally sell at cost, with the AH only taking its cut when the mats finally sell. At one point when I was active in working the AH, my 'toon was handling about 70% of the enchanting mats on the AH, with the associated income. And she didn't even need to be online spamming trade for hours since she was simply selling the mats that other enchanters were using to actually perform the enchants. Remember, when a player wants an enchant, a frequent procedure was for the player to give the mats and a tip to the enchanter, who then applied the enchant. Think of where the player got the mats.
---
I've been wanting to play Druid for classic. I have interest in both endgame pvp and pve. Is there a spec where u can still get a healing spot in raids, and be able to actually fight players in BGS instead of just healing?
---
You're technically correct. But I'm going to assume if there are videos from actual Vanilla showing that X is true, it will also be true in Classic.
---
I find 2/3 Blizzard annoying to play with compared to 3/3 
---
I agree with 90% of your bullet points and I'm not even gonna nit-pic the ones I am unsure on. 
---
"Rep grinds became meaningless; on one hand, you get to around half-way to revered without effort, on the other they never end anymore."
---
This is huge. I remember it was an achievement of you got revered before am Expansion came out. It was hard enough in Vanilla and it taught you that balance between going ham and pacing yourself. 
---
Then the BC rep grind I think was easier for some factions but others still took awhile. 
---
If you think about it it's like real life. There are difficult things you could do before having a kid like taking every bit of overtime or entering for promotion. Or you could just coast by.
---
But when that kid comes that past opportunity is gone. You've got new shit to do. So weighing carefully the concept of "I have a limited time to do this, it's got it's rewards, but it's a big task" was a binpart of Vanilla BC for me.
---
I know some other games do this. Maybe retail still doesnI don't know. I just remember I miss it.
---
Some people like taking on extra work or tasks and some don't. I think it's fine to lock some basic stuff lie mounts or top 10 armor for any slot or a unique cape design behind a rep grind *as long as th Brest of the content is still amazing and plentiful.*
---
The wait is killing me slowly
---
I am becoming batshit insane 
---
OMG. Did you at least inform him afterwards about the quest so he could remedy his lack?
---
Trolls are the best
---
That's account theft protection. You unlock it once and you're good to go. They can detect it, sure, but they don't ban it unless you do something else that's shady. 
---
Rift was great. I was playing a Cleric and hat so much fun. The rifts in the open world were a really cool element. I was only playing for a few months though. Tried it later when it was free to play and pay to win but then the game was completely different.
---
I'm hoping it's LATER then July 16! I'm moving back to America this summer and won't have access to my PC until late July D:
---
I completely agree...which is why I reach for /ignore. No need for administrative oversight, totally not abusable, problem solved.
---
I will play on a Mac. Speaking of which, I am worried that Alt and Kntrl are hard to reach.
---
Level ranges got added in tbc prepatch
---
Level boosts aren't p2w. They are pay to skip the garbage filler. So you can actually do the fun content at the late game.
---
its stuff like this and devilsaur mafias that sends chills down my spine, we got served a huge chance to go back to a world we all enjoyed, why ppl gotta be like that smh.
---
Most jobs in Europe end around 17:00.
---
The commute from the workplace to home is another 30 min. on average. So, most people will be home at around 18:00. Regardless if you got family or not, spending 30-45 min after you got home, for a shower, a meal, 10-15 relaxing on a coach or having a coffee, etc. and all of a sudden, an European with a job will probably fire up his PC around 18:30-18:45.
---
There is simply no way, for most working Europeans, to start raiding in WoW before 18:30 at the earliest. And you still need like 10-15 min to sort out your in-game shit before actually start raiding.
---
As for "grown up" guilds that might start earlier...I don't see how this will be possible outside Saturday and Sunday, for Europeans. And since Sat and Sun are family time days, or going out days...
---
Being a grown up in Europe implies jobs and/or family. It also implies working until 17:00, on average and commute home for another 30-45 min. And it also implies weekends for IRL stuff.
---
If anything, the "grown up" guilds in Europe will most likely start raiding around 19:30-20:00.
---
Add in the time difference between Eastern EU (GMT+2), Central EU (GMT+1) and Western EU (GMT+0) and everything is a total mess for raiding starting hours.
---
19:00 is the most acceptable time for Europe. Can't go around it, except for weekends. But as I said...weekends are for IRL.
---
a stack of 45 food?  what planet you from

I was really burned out on BC when Warhammer Online got going so it was a nice change of pace.

Too bad the engine was clunky as fuck.

Removed for Rule #7 as being not obviously related to Classic WoW beyond the post title. Sorry!

Yes, but he seemed uninterested for whatever reason if I recall correctly.
---
Removed as a repost, sorry for the inconvenience!
---
Removed for Rule #1, being not really related to Classic... sorry about that!
---
I feel you. I go up at 04:45 and I am at work 06:00. Raiding to 23:00 and maybe 30+ minutes for extended raid would mean like 5 hours of sleep. Sure, I could sleep when I get home, but then it's like Work, sleep, WoW, sleep, Work... Wait, that sounds great! ... ;)
---

It's a matter of preference tbh. I don't know your sleep pattern so I can only make a broad assumption.

Nibba Starwing, purple w tiddies, was flying through the sky on a Griffon named Jim. Nibba called him GRIFFONE because she taught it made him fancy.  Jim hated that.  \*My name is Jim\* he would muse resentfully. "Oh, GRIFFONE.  How did you get so Fancy?"  Jim narrowed his eyes and shuddered.  She heard what sounded like a cannon and moments later was engulfed in a giant net with Jim,plummeting downward. After what seems like an eternity or no time at all the net snagged and was wrenched upwards.  They were hanging from a wooden watchtower.  "GRIFFONE! Are you okay?" He stared at her intensely then started clawing at the net eyes wide with frustration.  Stardusttt saw something green out of the corner of her eye amidst the orange landscape.  She look down to a buff green guy looking up at her, with a hungry expression and a little smile on his face.  "Shrek?" she asked tentatively.  "NO ME NO SHREK NO" the buff green man stamped his feet and ran in a circle, apparently irritated.  Jim was clawing more viscously at the net.  \*What could be worse than Shrek?\* Jim thought terrified. The net gave out and Nibba and Jim hit the ground hard.  Jim shook the remains of the net from his wings and flew away immediately.  A few moments later a muffled, "MY NAME IS JIM" reached her ears from high above as the buff green man who was not Shrek was running to her incentively...
---
You could and I know plenty of people that did it 
---
These days it's harder because blizzard has better tech to detect these things so I think the issue won't be as common  
---
How much aoe do shamans have?
---
And are shamans able to do much any solo runs or mid and end game content? Like a hunter can go example?
---
Dont everyone get to start from scratch in Classic servers anyway?
---
Isn't that BiS all of Vanilla for some healers?
---
It's WotLK. See the inscription right there?
---
It's annoying me greatly not having a date yet, I need to organise my summer vacation and I'm holding off. I am guessing end of August being we are only 55 days to summer now.
---
Since it promotes unhealthy gameplay I wouldn't mind if the amount of honor required to rank was reduced. 
---
Vote up, vote more! I wanna see Apple get stomped by one open source boi.
---
You're not clearing it faster though with all the time you're wasting between the raids. It's like spending two dollars in order to save one dollar. 
---
He can drop skinning at any time. It can be after 60. He just needs engineering once he starts raiding.
---
That just isn't true for my country. Normal here is 07 / 07.30 to 15.00. If you tell me other countries start at 9 I'll believe you, but damn that seems late.
---
&gt; Can't go around it, except for weekends. But as I said...weekends are for IRL.
---
That response is so weird. Just categorically stating that it can't be done, and that I should just give up on getting what I need.
---
Voodoo mask from ZF is always a good one imo
---
Never liked the premise of a single guild-enchanter, guild-smith etc. Too much power and gold for one person. There should always be several designated crafters that take turns with recipes. 
---
That would be an unexpected result to be sure :)
---
us west might be alright for ping, timezone difference will be a shit though
---
IDK about you, but I would also like some time between raiding and sleeping. That is a lot more important than having time between work and raiding. Once I get home, give me 15 minutes tops and I'll be ready.
---
Good stuff!
---
Reason for starting at 19 is you need to land at home, eat some dinner with your family or s/o before going online. Also starting 19 in Classic means you need to start getting buffs and stuff from 18. 
---
What's all this now?
---
The non-conjured food that requires lvl 45, which you can buy at most inns
---
Please try r/wowservers for Vanilla WoW macro requests.
---
Im not a min/maxer but just remember that as soon as i started raiding i got some +healing and Mp5 trinkets (Shard of the Scale fx) that served me better.
---
Listen to your classleader or raidleader
---
The burst does lessen as the rogue's opponents get better gear however the rogue has so much CC that it doesn't really matter. 
---
Rogue is still very good at dueling it's just that you have to try at high levels. 
---
Some new players even think CC is "dishonerable" (lol this is a high fantasy simulation of life and death mortal nemesis war where each of us has the agency to kill the enemy on sight). Those players that don't like using CC need to play another class. Rogue is very dependent on CC.
---
Username checks out 😂
---
I leveled a lock to level 58 and couldn't even get to 60 cuz of how God awfully boring the class was to me 
---
Agreed. My job ends at 17:15 and I can be home as soon as 17:30/45, depending on traffic. By the time I change clothes, get a drink and fire up the PC it's more or less 18:00. Add the usual 20-30 minutes of catching up and browsing Reddit, and I'll be in WoW around 18:30.
---
I think in OP's case, it might be best to wait for realms to launch, roll somewhere and start a thread on that specific realm/forum and start gathering people with very similar free timeframes so he can raid with them.
---
If I ever raid, it would also probably be between 19:00 to 23:00 latest, since sleep is as important as air.
---
Oceanic realms on US might be a good solution. -1 to +1 hours timezone difference so you can play prime time. Latency may not be too bad (you can ping retail oceanic to find out) as the servers are in Sydney, Australia with a majority English speaking community.
---
Really? what happens when you have a vpn switched on and off and/or multiple homes? It is nothing of Blizzards business how you log in to the internet. 
---
I don't really have any problems falling asleep quite quick, I am usually so exhausted that my girlfriend says I fell asleep 30 seconds after I reply to something from bed.   
---
However, as you say, Imagine the Raid goes really bad or you win/lose an item that you have wanted to much, then some time to calm down could be real useful.
---
Boosting is just a modern word for a sell run. It was there in late stage vanilla too. 
---
Thanks for the links.
---
&gt; I believe that because the player base is nothing like it was in 2006, slight changes are justified 
---
Why do so many people assume that just because youtube guides are more available for example the playerbase automatically turns into hardcore players ?
---
Do you get more free time and more willpower to rank and raid just because it is 2019 and not 2005 ?
---
Its all about the ratio of hardcore vs casual players and in my opinion the ratio got even more extreme then back then.
---
How many hardcore guilds were around in Vanilla who battled for world firsts, how many are there now ?
---
Will the playerbase from 2005 who are now around 30 play more hardcore than in their teens ?
---
Did the overall gaming community turn more to the hardcore side ?
---
(Unreal Tournament, Quake , Starcraft Counterstrike vs Fortnite, Clash of Clans Mobile Games, Facebook Farmville, Flavour of the month Lootbox Games)
---
What do you think is more likely for the average retail player who is used to LFG tools to do:
---
Press a button and solo queue or organize and play with a premade ?
---
Ah, gotcha. That makes more sense, though it would be amazingly immersive for factions to be targeted if they flew over the opposite faction's territory.
---
I’m a Japanese/English speaker and advise that you definitely roll on an Oceanic server. Western Australia where I live now is the same Timezone as Tokyo and having a guild with Aus and Japanese players isn’t uncommon. 👍
---
Is there a dressing room where you could also add rings, amulets and trinkets?
---
Are protection warriors viable in PvP?
---
if you don't wipe which is likely the case when a raid is on farm, having all consumes and world buffs can shave off a lot of time 
---
Since raids promote unhealthy gameplay I wouldn't mind if the amount of time required to clear raids was reduced.
---
See how this works?
---
I completely agree.
---
Except Mulgore I guess?
---
IIRC Ion said in an interview that they would make it instant in classic. I don’t believe you can shift click mail though. 
---
Yeah. Finding a weekends raiding guild will make or break the raiding in classic for me.
---
I just can't stand the sleep deprivation anymore. If something is in my way to get 8-9 hours to rest, it's time to say goodbye to such thing.
---
Yes if you're using spreadsheets and pre-bis lists even with progressive itemization you will still find ways to break the MC gearing path however the majority of players won't be doing that. Progressive items is important so that little Timmy can walk in MC in his set of greens see a shitty vendorstrike drop and shit his pants in excitement over literal vendor trash because everything before in the game is total crap. This isn't a real example but that's the effect we're going for. There are a ton of items that are super short lived in vanilla that you will only use for a short amount of time. By adding progressive itemization you increase the value of these items. Why the hell would I bother farming out my epic warlock chest when I can just get robe of volatile power in MC? Make loot as shitty as possible so people have loads of stuff to go farm.
---
ikr? It's really funny when people rant about doing all that intensive farming just in the end to save 1-2 hours a night, while the actual farming process lasts an unfathomable number of hours (plus the subjective aspect that it can quickly get pretty repetitive and boring to farm all those things).
---
But what can we do. Being an asshole is a lifestyle.
---
Paladins exist with Illumination. 
---
Druids are great tank healers though. 
---
Where are you from? Could you join a guild with other people from your country since it seems to have a different schedule than other places in Europe?
---
play rp-pvp to avoid kids ahah i think they are gonna add it as option.  
---
BTW , I think that one of the best aspect of having a reboot is to have a more mature community fro 25 to 40+ years old... i dont think many 15-16yo will go to end game here ...they have fortnite nowadays
---
Not sure if its possible to explain to you how Vanilla is also difficult if you cannot see past the amount of mechanics.
---
Unless you have played it yourself you wont fully grasp how limited mana, limited CC, limited interrupts and mob packs that are larger than the tank can handle while being able to twoshot DPS contributes to a very different experience with difficulty in its own way. 
---
I also could not disagree more that Deadmines and vanilla dungeons are boring DPS races. My experience is the polar opposite. Every dungeon in BfA was a boring zerg where you spammed aoe buttons on targets where the tank has infinite aggro.
---
Great post and I agree on your points. It's pretty telling that there are so many negative responses in this thread that give little to no actual rebuttal to your salient points. Obviously there are some items that got better and some that got worse and in general the changes aren't game-breaking for the average gamer (or even the average raider). This sub at times just feels like an echo chamber with everyone just parroting the PServer veterans and they get can militant whenever anyone else presents counterpoints. Blizzard has already stated that they are holding back the major offenders in itemisation until later (Titanic Leggings, etc.) and that should be sufficient for balance purposes.
---
I get that the #NoChanges movement wants full progressive itemisation, but we need to be realistic with our expectations. Blizzard has already stated that they have lost a lot of pre-1.12 data and itemisation history. That they are restricting access to stuff like Titanic Leggings at all shows, in my opinion, that they are doing everything they feel they can to replicate the true Vanilla WoW experience. Having old T2 drop in MC and then taking it away and then changing it for BWL would not feel good at all.
---
Everyone that has played PServers for years will have trivialised all content regardless of itemisation regardless. The game needs to be balanced, not for those players, but for as true to a Vanilla experience as Blizzard is capable of creating with the resources they have (within reason).
---
I don't claim to be an expert on Vanilla (I made it to Loatheb in Vanilla raiding without personally killing C'thun). I just want to see constructive discussion on this sub. This post was well done and it's perfectly fine to disagree with it, but please be constructive and use evidence to counter the claims.
---
I remember doing this and then tricking others into doing it after I found out what it did lol you can't get that level of satisfaction in retail anymore. 
---
That alpha female troll is nightmare inducing.
---
I want to Tank and heal, mostly 5mans and maybe ZG/off tank MC etc if I get a hold on enough gear. I also want to be a healer PvP. I do not want to respec for any of this. What spec could be optimal for my wishes? I'm thinking something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTMscMdLVxfoso
---
Raids are nothing like the honor system.  You're not gonna lose loot gained from raids if you take a break for a week, and you don't have to raid 24/7 to get epics.
---
/e has reported you afk. Type /afk to clear this flag 
---
Thanks dude, this is the exact clarification I was looking for. Cunningham's Law in full effect.
---
ohhh sorry i thought u meant there were 45 bits of food in a stack haha
---
Just log on retail and check. You can play til level 20 for free. From Shanghai I got about 230-250 on the various oceanic servers, and about 280-300+ on USWest.
---
To be fair, you cannot really fail at attaining max level on vanilla either, it just takes much longer.

You're saving like 30 minutes by farming for hours. We didn't use any of that shit back in the day and we didn't wipe and we cleared our farm raids in like 2 hours tops.

There is a belt in scholo that drops off the gargoyle boss it gets changed in a later patch
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=13956
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13956
---
As you can see they add 1% hit making the item pre-bis for warlocks until you can get access to rare epics like mana igniting chord in MC.
---
Why do I know about this? This was an item that Nost failed to progressively itemize when they did their item passes so I was essentially breaking the game and getting access to items sooner than I should have been able to. It felt bad to wear this crappy blue belt with no real stats on it over purple belts and destroyed the belt slot for my character entirely for months until new items got added.
---
As a warlock you didn't SS the healer when you got into the dungeon? Odd choice.

LF US guild for causal raiding and pvp. I have a FT job and family commitments so it’ll be random as far as playtime goes. Ally or horde I don’t care. Raid times preferably 6-10/11pm CST. 
---
&gt;A great example between these two. Deadmines v.s. Shrine of Storms. Deadmines: Basically just DPS race everything.  Shrine of Storms: Adds with Buffing mechanics that you need to kick, Adds with special Armor buffs that your Priest can mass dispell, Adds with super high DOT effects that HAVE to be cleansed or they die in like 2 seconds. Every Boss has multiple special mechanics that have to be played around. Even the named adds have special mechanics.
---
Here's your problem. You only focus on endgame raiding and how mechanically complex it is. Which is not what Classic is about AT ALL.
---
Classic is at its core a social game. People didnt play the game for 10 years on private servers because the game is particularly challenging, but because of how deeply ingrained the need to socialized and be active in the community is in the game.
---
Ooooooo lol ok
---
true, but classic will be different ghan vanilla. lot more powerful computers (no 3-fps raids), better server and connection (no 800ms average raidlag), the internet is 100x more powerful in terms of information, tricks etc.
---
A casual player today will play a lot better than 15yr ago, even if he doesn't try to minmax at all
---
Ping to west coast NA isn't so bad. It's around 120
---
Oceanic will be slower at around 200-250, but the timezones match up better
---
It's an easy choice for me. All my buddies are in NA and I will move back eventually too so it makes sense
---
I feel like if classic is a huge success they may consider creating a new expansion or new content in vanilla's image. 
---
Ofc they wont. Classic is built on the idea that your choices and reputation matters. It takes a LONG time to get 60 in Vanilla, which serves to keep people behaving well and in check. Character boosts, realm transfer and name changes are the most toxic and worst features to have ever entered retain in my opinion, because your reputation and your own social standing as a player lost all meaning.
---
Thats a level 64 Paladin wearing quest gear from Zangarmarsh.
---
He wasn't too far off, honestly.
---
Yea, the logic is backwards. Once the content is on progression, the time used to farm exceeds the time saved from the buffs. Many guilds on pservers used to go around getting world buffs before each pull of a tough boss though.
---
Lol isn't it it's like a blue Mike Wazowski.
---
You farmed for the progression run.  IF you wanted to be in the first kill raid you bring all the buffs you could think of.  
---
My Druid carried a set of agi pots.  For most of my alt raids.  (Sure I had flasks on him but I don’t think I used them).   
---
But let’s phrase it like this after two wipes on a hard boss at a certain place you just tell everyone to pot up and clear him.  Jindo  is an example of first time we faced him after two wipes we asked kindly to buff up what every you got/ downed him.  Same goes to first time we cleared Baron Geddon in MC.  Or veal in BWL.   
---
[First Mate Hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2955/first-mate-hat). It would be hard to specifically farm that one though since it's more or less a world-random-drop.    
---

Wow, what a time capsule. Crazy you haven’t played at all since 2006. Did you level up to 120 over the free weekend?
---
you can hop to wetlands and back a few times. ive never actually done ashenvale yet because the horde:alliance ratio was always massivly imbalanced.  might give it a whirl if i play druid/rogue though
---
Thanks mate.
---
Excellent players will be considered regardless of race choice. It just happen to be, that the players wishing to join a top tier guild. Are themselves aiming to the top of the line players, and will pick the best racials for their class.
---
Revamped from a proper mmo into a lobby game. 
---
Haha no.
---
Good: Starts out easy with non-elites and gets progressively harder
---
Bad: You won't know your group isn't capable until the lumber or smelter room, wasting a LOT of time
---
Good: the entire human starting area lore leads up to this instance/VC
---
Bad: You completely defeat the brotherhood and the story line abruptly comes to an end, segmenting it from the rest of the game.
---
Good: Picking the door lock doesn't alert smite and cause guards to check it out, rewarding!
---
Bad: Did you ever really notice if it was harder or not blowing up the door? not rewarding.
---
Good: Pre-dungeon area was perfect for an MMO back in those days with previews of the types of mobs and a great place to grind with 2-3 people while putting together a group.
---
Bad: Never used for that, people rarely visit the undead part, rush past and train mobs to instance portal near the end.
---
Good: Last boss spawns adds, a great introduction to the mechanic for new players and rewards communication and good target focus, skills you'll want for group content for the rest of the game.
---
Bad: cannon glitch widespread, newer players learn to hop on a cannon instead of all the good stuff.
---
I could keep going.  The place is amazing.  Super linear made up of major rooms that are very VERY easy to tell apart compared to some other early places (most of WC looks the same to me).  Non-elites mixed with elites because it's an early instance and the use of miners as non-elites is super thematic and not just done for balance.  But at the same time there is so so much wrong with the place. 
---
Also it has calendar, achievements and even dungeon finder suggesting that this picture is on or after patch 3.3.0
---
&gt;https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGshbZbvt0c0q  
---
&gt; You still have five points for either spiritual healing or mental strength. Choose whether you need more +healing, or more mana.
---
?? Spirit of Redemption instead of Divine Spirit? Why would you go that talent? That build is actually close to the standard healing Holy healing build though.
---
well naturally this is what would happen if classic is a hit, however I feel like they would maybe also change retail wow to fit vanilla's image 
---
Let people do as they do, The hardecores will play with the hardcores and everyone else who is looking to just play will get to play with like minded people. 
---
The hardcore will be a small % of players spread out over several servers so its not going to be something you will see or deal with. 
---
Yea, BRD is the best dungeon for sure. It’s pure RPG fantasy done perfect. I’m most excited to get back in there with a guild group. No m+ timers to deal with — just the adventure of it.
---
And you think private servers are any easier? lol
---
It **is** archaic game design, though. Not sure what it was revamped to adapt to, though... perhaps a more conservative business practice by Activision-Blizzard, heh.
---
During Vanilla?
---
Yes because it’s not like it was.  I have tried hardcore raiding. But eventually I started my own guild and we had a totally different approach to it. It did work with less hassle for me.  As gm.  
---
IDK, i'd say that you can fail by giving up. Most people have a mental limit, and close to 0% of people will reach that limit on modern wow, where they can't take it anymore. Meanwhile there will be lots of people who give up in Classic, either because it takes too much time, or they died *again* and got pissed. 
---
To be fair, Paladins can also pull decent numbers using Crowd Pummelers. SoR base it's damage off of weapon speed, and Pummelers increase speed by 50% meaning you get a 2.0 scaling on the Seal with a drastically higher attackspeed.
---
With that high of an attackspeed, and a spellpower build, your Dragonsbreath Chili and Shadow Oil start going off all the time, hitting for 500-900 damage each with spellpower gear.
---
Is it expensive? Yes, very. But if someone is willing to do it you can do competitive damage.
---
FeelsRetMan
---
No, I just logged in, checked out my gear (better than I anticipated tbh apart from that Bonescraper MH + Bonescraper OH thing I had going on :D), what I had in my bank and run around a bit in SW with the new harbor and all. 
---
So pay to skip leveling, and then pay at max level to buy gear on the auction house. Sure, thats not gonna *clear raids for you*, but it's a huge advantage. Enough to make me not want to play the game.
---
In the modern game, people seem to think that you're a scrub if you take over 10 days to level. But it's fun to take your time and waste it too.
---
Eyepatch from UBRS is always a good one. 
---
ZF plate shoulders are pretty iconic.
---
Full scarlet chain set plus herods shoulder and helmet. 
---
The crux of the issue is that you're competing against other people instead of just doing tasks A-Z (like frostsaber).  Difficulty is 99% determined by other players.  If no one is doing 16 hour days of honor grinding you won't need to do that either to keep up.
---
The only option to give blizz control over the high rank grind would be to remove the cap of players who can be rank 14, thus removing the competition for those spots.  They could do that, but it wouldn't be a small change it would be a change to the basis of the system.
---
Not surprising. If anything, I'm surprised I didn't get more.
---
Agreed. The [Imperial Plate] set consisted of Boots, Leggings, Gloves, Bracers, Shoulders and Helm. It was crafted by a Blacksmith and I believe the level range was around 40-47, most parts requiring Thorium.
---
Like buying a Ferrari for the sole purpose of driving 10 minutes to work.
---
I’ve definitely heard of guilds exclusively picking up Dwarf Priests because of fear ward. Like I said, they are the 1% tryhards. They’re not prominent but they’re out there.
---
Sorry if I exaggerated, I’m a scrub just trying to join in on the discussion. Are Orcs literally not the #1 PvP race because of the stun resist? And gnomes the premier casters because of +int?
---
By that logic you can fail at everything else you listed.
---
Like it or not, vanilla wow was already super casual when it came to leveling because it is literally impossible to lose progress, aka, fail.
---
If you are talking raid then honestly almost no classes. 
---
Mage only frostbolt, Warlock only shadowbolt, rogue SS Evis, Warrior bloodthirst rage dump, Hunter aimed shot on CD, feral druid shift claw bite, 
---
Throw a dart and see what one gets chosen. 
---
"everyone must have access to the best gear" Is something you can find on retail if you'd like.  I didn't mind never hitting 14 I was fine at rank 7 or so.
---
It certainly is archaic game design, but there is nothing at all wrong with that.
---
You do not wan to be a enchanter, you want to be a dis-chanter, if you play the right class you can solo 40-50 lv dungens for nice Large Brilliant Shard.
---
What's a hunter doing there
---
experienced players opinion? yes
---
rogues get outscaled by most other classes, and if being played by someone competent, becomes difficult to deal with
---
It wasn't based on honor if I remember, it was based off overall rank.  If you had the most honor that week you moved forward the most, regardless of if that was 1000 honor or 1,000,000.
---
Competing with other players obviously promotes serious competition, just like Scarab Lord.
---
Give it a try, it works
---
Not seen in this picture: Shadowpriest and Boomkins sobbing.
---
Wont Classic servers be a fully new character roll for everyone?
---
Seen some ppl say they cant wait to use their old chars, que?
---
STVietnam, the gate at Blackrock Mountain
---
Keep your eye out for a guild that does the times you want.
---
Problem is most people are not even out of work by half 5 / 6 let alone home have washed and had something to eat which is why 7 is the normal raid time, Lets you get done what you need to get done after work and still be on time to the raid. 
---
And since then they've had no reason to make the non max level game fun because people will just give them money to skip it 
---
Giving the Trueshot Aura!
---
Good to know, it is against ToS tho
---
Wow, no bully.
---
I want the mechanics to be the same but I would prefer more straightforward numbers instead of the almost arbitrary correlation between honor and rating.
---
I don’t think they should change the system at all.
---
In terms of finding a system that is not time sensitive they could remove weekly honour cap and set the ranks to a certain amount of honour rather than standings (based of current honour figures, with decay factored in). Then people could save up marks of honour and do a mass turn in to hit a specific rank or similar.
---
This way total time spent and success needed (for pre-mades) to get HWL would remain the same but not to such a strict schedule.
---
Yeah but we still get Salv and Kings :)
---
Most european people stop working between 4-6pm so count travel time, shower etc and u get why 
---
I had Twisting Nether on as part of my mounting set.  Never know when you'll randomly die.  ;D
---
Try Québec, some are on French server
---
In no particular order: ST, ZF, Strath, Scholo. All really cool and a joy to run.
---
I want it like in the beginning, gotta keep the rank to wear the gear
---
Yeah it’s not like Everquest where you’d lose xp. I’m not saying it’s not casual, I’m saying it’s a lot easier to give up/fail in a game where it takes longer, and at every point things have the opportunity to kill you. Compared to a game where a new player will probably make it to max level with a tiny number of deaths to dissuade then.
---
But again, they’ve said literally nothing regarding progressive itemization. It’d be nice to hear it in a blue post. 
---
If they release the game with support for linux I will be there
---
enhancement. your pal would have way too aggro from healing and it doenst worth it anyway. i played shaman+warrior with my brother until 42 and we were beasts. healing in dungeon is just enough, intellect gear is important to have on the sides, otherwise have fun rolling for strength:p
---
and also, be orcs. that duo is insane
---
They confirmed they will be the "open all" feature. The argument was that if they didn't, everybody will DL an add-on to do so
---
everyone will have to make a new character, no character transfers from retail or old characters from original vanilla
---
Shenna
---
I bet Joana will have a new in-game guide for Horde. I always like Brian Kopps guide for alliance so their are options.
---
Boosters charge over a thousand just to farm a single island/pandaria world boss mount, imagine the prices for rank 14!
---
&gt;That just isn't true for my country. Normal here is 07 / 07.30 to 15.00.
---
Fair enough but all of our countries work day is 09:00-17:00 or in more recent years 10:00-18:00 
---
I assume you are in a hot country like spain or some such where you need to be home before the raging late afternoon heat takes you out but most of europe is very mild and our work days reflect that just like yours reflects your countries climate. 
---
&gt;That response is so weird. Just categorically stating that it can't be done, and that I should just give up on getting what I need.
---
No hes not, Hes saying that the whole of europe with a mostly established raid time (there are outliers like yourself or people who work nights that form their own guids that fit their playing hours) but you can not and will not get all of europe to change their raid times just to fit you. 
---
You work around guilds, Guilds dont work around you. There will no doubt be a guild the times you are looking for you just need to keep looking. 
---
Fair enough. To be honest, my prediction is more of a plan. The plan is to create a giant RP PvP based guild that levels slowly as a giant group but would remain formidable due to it's size. Hopefully, wherever we go we'd act as a bug lamp for the server's world PvP. But we'd also show up to deal with defense issues a lot too.
---
considering that the barrens were quite the only reliable way to navigate through Kalimdor, the only one being some Stonetalon Mountains and Desolace with an extremely curvy path.
---
Also, there were a lot of class, Alliance and neutral quests in the Barrens.
---
&gt;I don't really do anything on 10am on a sunday anyways, ever.
---
Still sleeping off the hangover at that time. 
---
Not at all, the only thing you bring is a medicore stun
---
btw, you can't use enemy faction flightmasters and flight points, anyway.
---
I'm not huge on WoW lore but I believe zone names are unique and used by both factions. Sort of how the country "France" is called "France" by *most* other languages, some being slightly different.
---
It's also no secret that Orcs and Humans could understand each other in some cases, so in random points in time when either faction was exploring the other continent, they might have learned the real names of each zone from the inhabitants.
---
Also for convenience's sake it's easier to have them all the same.
---
In vanilla the leveling is a major part of the game. Plus, being 60 and having gold is a right of passage that shows you know at least a little bit about how to play your character. 
---
yes
---
They are in the battleground Alterac Valley where tanks are needed for completion 
---
that will kill you on any sign of contest
---
Both Windows and Mac. Built my PC for gaming but I have a MacBook for travelling / work. So when I'm on the move I'll be using my Mac and PC while home.
---
I feel like this is due a bit to itemization. Something I hope they fix in the future.
---
No see here's the thing, if you time it just right with your seal of blood...
---
Reasonable point, but you can literally just tank it with a sub-par sword &amp; board arms/fury warrior :(
---
Why? Depending on what you have, it might still work. Should be both Windows and Mac supported. Linux via Wine might also work with some fiddling. You can also always Dual-Boot a Windows OS to play Classic.
---
me for last 15 yrs as ret main in every exp
---
Not sure I totally understood what you are saying but the horde definitely didn't name kalimdor. In WC3 medivh tells thrall about kalimdor before anyone on Eastern kingdoms had apparently heard of it
---
Give it a try on a pirate server? Thank you Your Honour, I rest my case.
---
NO WE CAN DO IT FFS WE CAN DOOO IT
---
\#CHANGE
---
What do you guys estimate how big will the wow client get once classic launches? (In gigabytes)
---
i approve and i am a pally main
---
This game was made by gamers. They knew that if they didn't have this forced down time we would never take care of ourselves. #poopsockingit
---
New doesn't mean something is better.
---
Balls of steel to be heading to Scholomance at level 5 man 
---
There really has to come an official date soon, otherwise im gonna be pretty worried that Classic wont come this summer..
---
Doomhrm : &lt; Yell&gt; : KEK
---
welp im dead
---
It's not about the things that we already have, it's that most of them suck compared to classic.
---
I'd say it's pretty chill and I definitely enjoyed it. There's basically gonna be a couple people designated as tank heals and the rest are gonna be raid heals. For most fights this is gonna be a game of whackamole where 8 other healers are trying to whack your moles (heals) before you. Unless you're a shaman and then you just cast chain heal because it looks cool and actually smart heals.
---
For the most part, no.
---
A prot warrior can fill in some niche-roles. Prot warriors can be quite good flag carriers in WSG. I did some premades with my guild as a designated flag carrier. It's also great to have a prot warrior able to tank hard-hitting NPC's in AV.  But, your niche as a prot warrior in PvP can be done by a feral druid too. In particular, the flag carrying business. 
---
Prot warriors are of course great vs rogues and other warriors in a 1vs1, but against ranged classes? Forget it. Same goes for any class with the ability to heal.  
---
The rogue rotation wasn’t complicated but it is very rewarding to maintain and position yourself well.
---
Uptime on a mob as well as keeping snd up is a very zen feeling.
---
Indeed the time/price is the only thing that makes me thing that it won't happen that way :) 
---
This is a pretty vapid video. Top lists are for comparison or choice. There are barely more than 5 legendaries in classic as is! 
---
Yeah but winning should be about skill not about who can raid.
---
Why your PVP achievements should depend on your PVE progression ?
---
Imagine the protests if to be able to clear Naxx you had to have R14 gear ...
---
It seems some hardcore gamers love to cheese everything : get a metric shit ton of  buffs so the raid become easy mode and get overgeared so PVP is unchallenging.
---
2am flight paths. Love it 
---
They will just create a lvl 1 character with the same name, same race / class / physical features than their old char.
---
I was hoping to join a Japanese guild for free Japanese reading practice, so this might be the best bet! thanks!
---
You won't see them in raids either  ^/s
---
It’s hard to describe, I’ve been playing on a pvp server and it’s annoying to be ganked but when you have a good fight vs someone it’s such a good feeling afterwards
---
No they're not. Even a fury warrior isn't optimal unless overgeared (yeah I know swifty, hence my overgeared comment).
---
You have clearly never played Warsong Gulch.
---
He was speaking about mail. I think mail became instant in patch 2.01 just before BC.
---
We said grats not gz. 
---
I will raid as shadow one way or another 😭
---
12GB
---
they are intelligent enough to not show up to raids
---
No, no-one ever said gz, they said grats. 
---
And more strictness in terms of cross zone players, I.e. Chinese can’t play on NA except with a VPN
---
did we play different vanilla wows?
---
hunter is #1 dps contender during all of preraid content and MC and Onixia
---
hunter still belongs to top dps in BWL
---
Hunter falls back at AQ and Naxx compared to pure dps classes, still viable dps and necessary for tranq, trueshot..
---
we must have played different games i guess.
---
I was under the assumption that it was going to be a separate client.
---
Ding yes, grats yes, gz no. 
---
One for only ~200 guilds to clear naxx in vanilla and we didn’t use any consumables other than on the main tank and mana pots. But then we didn’t have “alt raids” etc. 
---
It was way more chill than you’re making it sound. Perhaps pserver audiences are way more hardcore than “hardcore vanilla” players. 
---
I started in the open beta. We said grats not gz. 
---
The only way to change how your character looks  is to put on or take off items. There is no dressing room. 
---
It's using legion client so technically it's not 15 years old game
---
Kiljoy, and i dont think so.
---
It only adds to the sadness that is being a hunter in raids.
---
They give you a small taste of greatness in not having to worry about threat so much, only to be at spot 10-15 after a couple BWL clears and only going down.
---
P.S. I like playing hunter
---
Same. I understand the logic, but after testing both, 3/3 blizzard slows the mobs SO much and makes the aoe grind far more forgiving 
---
They barely have any aoe. Fire nova totem is the only real one. They can’t solo instances like a hunter can. 
---
Raid wide damage was much rarer though. Using it after raid dmg or off dmg hit you were pretty certain not to take damage again until the hot had expired. 
---
It's almost exclusively due to itemization, AQ for example gives a huge boost to most classes, while hunters get (almost) nothing.
---
Exactly, and that is true not just in game design.
---
On EU servers I get around 300 ms from China (Guangzhou), which is not great, but definitely playable. Only sucks a bit if you plan to PVP, otherwise it’s almost irrelevant imo.
---
No
---
After the first progress cycle through naxx we might see changes like that. Don’t get your hopes too high just yet.
---
Yeah I know, but their raiding time is usually around 1 to 5am !
---
Also, it's essentially a Canadian accent, but in the US. 
---
Depens when you did those raids, hunters got nerfed during almost every patch because they were imba in PvP and Blizzard had problems to balance the class.
---
Right so after the first couple of years I think they should add a few small items across all raids that close that gap a bit.
---
Whooooosh
---
Where is the comparison for spellcasters?
---
I love to complete as much as possible, so I want to go in many zones while leveling.
---
But I will also play as human and want the nelf mount.
---
My plan for this is to go to teldrassil directly after character creation and then do all quests in the zones teldrassil, darkshore and ashenvale. After this I would go to elwynn forest, westfall and duskwood,...
---
is this a good plan or would this hinder my plan to also get the nelf mount?
---
I believe its just Chain lightning, Magma Totem and Fire Nova Totem.
---
The 1.12 version of vanilla can surely be improved by fiddling with talents etc. but it can also be destroyed by recklessly changing things without thinking them through. So I undertand the hesitation of the no changes folks when it comes to things like this.
---
What the, are you levelcapped or what? 1.8g for a single quest?
---
How can you argue being good at the start and then only going down, as a good thing?
---
The only few upticks a hunter can expect are: full t1, full t2, chromaggus xbow and trinket swapping.
---
&gt;For most fights this is gonna be a game of whackamole where 8 other healers are trying to whack your moles (heals) before you
---
Yeah it's what I was afraid of. I won't make a healer main then.
---
Yeah same here, really early on in vanilla, ashenvale wpvp raids was very common, often bleeding into the barrens. I even remember playing the open beta sometime late 2004 and attending a huge wpvp raid in ashenvale. On my server, the SS/TM battle started a few months later when the honor system was released, when there was no battlegrounds around
---
Yeah premades will ruin any casual PvP attempts but that just means I wont be touching BG's outside of AV (Maybe not even AV with the changes) Its not a big issue, You adapt to it and become a premade or you dont play that aspect of the game. 
---
I have an annoying big monitor and I would prefer if I just had 2 instead, especially because you are specifically talking about Classic, I think a 2nd monitor is a no brainer.
---
In Vanilla there’s a lot of down time or “brainless” time where you can have youtube or farming guides, whatever, open on the 2nd monitor while you farm mats or something.
---
Find a guild in GMT+2 or +1 and you will raid earlier, no ?
---
Oh I played the hell out of regular peggle and peggle 2, didnt realize this addon existed, will have to give it a go!
---
Don't forget about that Nerubian Slavemaker, which will help you defeat all the other bosses after KT... oh, wait.
---
It's not mandatory for the guild master to also be the raid leader, it can even be a good thing to separate the roles.
---
I got that exact stup lmao. 8700K  @ 5Ghz and MSI 1080 GAMING X. and I LOVE IT ANYWAY!!
---
In my opinion changes to items is more manageable than talent changes and I don’t put them on the same level of importance.
---
Talents should almost never be changed.
---
Items are small stat boosts that are more controllable. 
---
Oh god imagine being that sad. "This guild did not get server first 60! DISBAND THIS GROUP OF CASUALS!"
---
Safe? Not really no, You need to head to westfall and kill defias. Best bet is to get it from inside the dungeon. 
---
Ive done several 3-5 hour sessions of brd full quest run. Il gladly do em again :)
---
Sure, but then items get changed, hunters are better at DPS and then ret palas will (rightfully imo) expect changes for them too. But I don't think items are enough to make them viable so talents have to be changed which might lead further down a pass nobody is willing to take.
---
I would stay as much as you can in the Night elf areas. Look up a guide on all the quest that give rep for Darnassus. Even then you will still need cloth turn in or morrowgrain to reach exalted.
---
&gt; Now I am not going to handwave away all the concerns, but I do think most of them are strongly overstated. Spellhit started showing up in a lot more places. At the same time, T2 started not dropping from MC... That's right, T2 used to drop in MC. Is that something we want too? 
---
And this is when we know to ignore your post. T2 never dropped in MC on private servers.
---
I think paladins would get that buff before hunters I was just talking. 
---
You are right items aren’t enough to change it completely, just close the gap a little.
---
Small changes over time done with precision I think is the only way to do it correctly.
---
I used to have a Hunter pet named "RetPallyDPS". 
---
There's a shaman/pally shield that looks like a big spinning gear that drops from Maraudon. With a cool 1h you could throw together some kinda plate techno warrior look.
---
In a competitive raid guild you'll be clearing farm raids in less than an hour. The really try hard ones running stupid amounts of fury warriors can clear them in under 30 minutes. Not saying that's the right mindset, but buffs make a huge difference.
---
I'm gonna be playing either a Warlock or Mage when Classic rolls out, and have been thinking about the different professions lately. 
---
While leveling I'm gonna go with two gather professions (Herb &amp; Skinning or Mining &amp; Skinning) but since I wont be able to play all day everyday I've been conflicted in regards to which professions to use when level 60. Since I wont be able to play the amount of hours I want would it be smart to go with Herb and Alchy for the gold efficiency or should I go with Tailoring + Herb/Mining/Skinning for the gear.
---
Ret pally can contribute. Dont expect to be number 1 but with the most effort you can end up middle of the pack
---
CoH and Warhammer... ouch.
---
It has always been overwriting CoC at 3/3. Source: I aoe grinded two mages in vanilla.
---
Its a meme yo
---
1 hour into the raid:
---
*a random priest drops into shadowform*
---
Raid leader: "wait a minute.."
---
Holy shit this might be the first time I've seen someone use "kiddo" in a derogatory manner non ironically. Yikes, dude. Not a good look.
---
I'm not talking about reducing in-game clear times, I'm talking about reducing the time it takes you to get a given raid tier on farm.
---
A MC geared rogue with full consumables and worldbuffs will pull off better DPS than an AQ40 geared rogue with only player buffs. It's not rocket science.
---
A hunter is not a #1 dps contender during any part of vanilla. A feral druid will beat a hunter 9/10 times in raids like MC and Ony.
---
Yes but you still have to spend more time farming consumables and buffs than you save come raid night. 
---
Dude if you need hamstring kiting with a warrior AND a shaman, you're doing it wrong. The shaman should just frontload his spells / totems at the beginning of the fight then regen mana while auto attacking the mob. A heal every 2 or 3 mobs, rinse and repeat. They will never stop !
---
Why? Hunter is a pure dps class that can’t even dps, boosting their damage doesn’t mean ret damage should be boosted, as paladins already have a spec that performs in raids.
---
Nonsense. I have *Shadow Weaving*. Warlocks *need* me. Right ? RIGHT  ????!!!
---
Consumables on progress makes sense if you can't complete the content without them. World buffs doesn't since you'll lose them after the first wipe.
---
My current computer is a 2012 MacBook air that overheats playing anything, I figured windows would be cheaper than Mac if I want to get something new that can play games semi decently
---
I started in open beta too. We said both. 
---
You don't NEED to but it's being efficient. Nothing is stopping you from front loading while kiting. Kiting lowers your downtime by quite a bit.
---
I'd go for two, which is what I have. It's nice to have the very clean separation and fewer issues with comparability in funky apps.
---
Safe, why do you want to be safe ?!
---
I went to Dun Morogh with my lvl 15 troll hunter alt to steal a pet from the dwarves.
---
Did I die a million times ? Yes.
---
Was it worth it ? Absolutely !
---
Come on man we’ve been doing this journey like weekly for over a year now lol this stuff is fun but pushing limits is a journey in and of itself. 
---
A lot of the stuff I’ll put work and time into is like a PvP tourney, BG premades, world pvp raids, and stuff like that. 
---
It was WotLK launch and all I did was farm Herbs to sell on the AH, Herbs were in high demand since Inscription was a new profession.
---
one prot one holy for max aoe funtimes. You could do some quests in 1 or 2 pulls.
---
What an ODD child.

I wasnt a shadowpriest before Wrath, but i used to be put in the main tank group cuz of the Vampiric embrace healing, good times... 
---
Your edit is actual cancer. 
---
In retail vanilla while I was ranking we never really had queue dodgers. But when we got another premade it was an all out battle to see who gets the first flag, whichever side capped first would win the bg, capping the last 2 flags. Pretty good compromise to avoid 1-2hr WSGs.
---
Then on pservers, literally every horde premade we ran into would end up splitting (forming multiple 4mans) or dodging. Or they would call in the help of their top players (ex rankers) to try to hold us hostage in a wsg, which never worked for them, even though those games were really fun. Dodging/splitting really slowed our honor gain, but boosted the shitter alliance premades honor gain in relation to ours. TLDR: Something needs to be done to dodgers.
---
So a lot of times, we weren't able to get good queues, since the horde premades knew we were trying to queue, they would just split into smaller groups to avoid us. So then we just split into 4mans and simultaneously queued, and would 8/10 times end up with our full premade anyways. That system doesn't really work, capping group queues to something less than 5, and anyways it's a complete shit thing to do.
---
Also, it's probably more honor for a random solo queuer to keep getting paired against a premade and lose REALLY fast (token farm), than it is for him to get paired with other tryhard solo queuers who will almost always drag the game out longer than premade vs premades do anyways.
---
Ahh okay because I was thinking of just 2/3 split screening on an ultrawide monitor
---
Using autoshot alone without hit cap??? What are your parameters? Spec/rotation/consumables?
---
You're saying equal geared feral is going to beat weaving auto aimed auto multi?  Don't think so.
---
In all seriousness I will never understand why minor changes to tweak some abilities or change coefficients is such a big deal.
---
Honestly, I'd prefer a BC progression option after a couple of years than this or new lvl 60 content, etc. I just don't trust current Blizzard devs to not screw the pooch.
---
Can you tell me what this is about?
---
And here’s the reason why there will never be changes to classic.  No one knows how to ‘balance’ these classes and they don’t even know what classes to even balance.  Because we all think about balancing different today and it wouldn’t be a vanilla esq change.  Before you know it no one is Ooming anymore and everyone is doing the same damage and then we are back to where we are now.... with no vanilla gameplay 
---
Its great Because we can run it highdef 4K ultra Everything now instead of &lt;30 fps CRT monitor. So going all out is very worthwhile.

---
 [https://wowclassiccountdown.com/](https://wowclassiccountdown.com/)  This website basically explains the prediction.
---
It s a butterfly effect. Tweaking one class can alter the whole power dynamic
---
The point of worldbuffs is to ensure that you don't wipe.
---
If you've got better gear, you can get harder bosses on farm quicker. You can think of consumables and worldbuffs as loaned gear. Either way, it doesn't matter whether you think that they're moronic or not, it's a fact that they significantly speed up your progress through raid tiers.
---
I only ever used or saw romanji. However, discord might be a good place to practise as well. 
---
Maybe, but as part of a guild and raid, everything isn't about just you. Some people have things to do, so the faster you finish, the faster your raiders can do other things. You can farm your consumes at whatever time works for you during the week, so it's flexible for people schedules. But raid times aren't usually flexible when you have 40 raiders, so it's important to use your raid times wisely. 
---
You motherfucker you gave me a heart attack
---
It was revamped to adapt to players moving on to other games, which includes both the casual players who were caught off-guard by the seriousness of the 4.0 dungeons and the hardcore players who gradually lost interest throughout Cata as a result of Actiblizz's kneejerk response ("keep people subscribed and keep making us money no matter the cost") to the former group's complaints.
---
I just told you there won't be any downtime since the shaman will regen while auto attacking. 
---
The mobs will die faster, the warrior will take the hits but will mitigate better than a solo shaman, so less heals needed. If you need to drink with a warrior / shaman duo you either took a big ass elite or you're not allowing the shaman to regen (ie you're doing it wrong).
---
But practice what you preach and show us a video, I can't wait to see 2 idiots running around mobs thinking they're such efficient levelers :D
---
Oh if you were after anything new anyways, then you're right, it's cheaper for sure(by a large margin).
---
In this regard, I strongly recommend you visit /r/buildapc or maybe rather /r/buildapcforme . Mostly, that's even cheaper/better than pre-built PCs.
---
Currently, it's pretty damn cheap to buy a good 1080P Gaming PC.
---
You shouldn't clip you autoshot and Sometimes you have to kite.
---
You got to know where and what your pet do at all time.
---
Regardless of WoW version or content - unless we were undergeared, having a competent raid leader who has some reasonable set of minimum standards for attendees and can lead over VoIP, the content is doable and fun. The times when raids haven't been fun are when there is no competent RL and/or we just pack warm bodies to fill the slots. 
---
Your post hits the nail right on the head.
---
Howdy, if you are flexible about joing the Alliance then Glamorama could be the guild u want. We aim to do PvE-content while it's releveant, ie clearing BWL before AW etc. We will raid twice a week, 20-23 CET so perhaps a bit later then you want. We are a guild for grown up ppl that want stuff done but having fun doing it
---
Pls drop by our Discord and talk to us if you are intrested. We kinda need hunters so you'd be more then welcome  
---
**discord** [**https://discord.gg/92V5CCD**](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) **,**  
---
I agree that’s why I left that guild. My own guild ended up reaching aq40.  But I think it was a fair middle ground. We ask you to buff up when we where failing. No yelling no complaining where other rules we had.  Only problem I had to do was talk to a hunter once who showed up without arrows. That was not ok as it prolonged the raid.  
---
Just FYI I know in vanilla wow you couldn't get the starter quests in a zone different then your own race, I would recommend doing your own zone til lvl ~6 then going over and starting in the second night elf zone in teldrassil. 
---
Shoot
---
At 300 ping id rather just not play, even 100 ping is annoyingly slow to react to key presses.
---
Ofc this is aswell an option and as I wrote I choose not to touch regrowth in the explanation since you again here need some gear and such to keep it up with mana spamming regrowths. However in a perfect world where you have a good raid this is possible since no fight should be longer than 2 minutes. However the healing doesnt get that higher with regrowth but its true that you can use it in that way but its more high-end. In a sense its better in hectic fights. But then again, no fight should be long enough for you to go oom and stand there doing nothing. If you know how to manage mana you use regrowth if you dont, dont. Never go over R4. 
---
Which happened throughout vanilla, and was in a pretty bad place overall in 1.12.
---
Part of the culture of vanilla wow was the constant lobbying and anticipation of needed changes.
---
Once you have a second you will never go back to one
---
That's what I mean. Instead of pushing WoW in new directions (those that would make it seem like a completely new game in 5-10 years), they instead kept consolidating existing mechanics over and over and over. 'Revamping WoW' with each expansion past WotLK is what I was referring to by the 'conservative business practices.' 
---
15 fucking years later WoW is still some tab target MMORPG. With resources that each WoW expansion provided Blizzard we could've had something with Star Citizen's vision in a fantasy world, but nope. They (Activision, presumably) did not want to take any risks because WoW was too big of a cash cow for big, reformative, design decisions.
---
Top 5 zones of all time
---
Thank you!
---
As a long time shaman, I'm just here to enforce the comments that ench Shaman and arms Warrior are in the god-tier league of duo levelers.
---
Here's the spec I use  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbux0hZxVbdVMut](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbux0hZxVbdVMut) start in the ench tree obviously.
---
So you think you will have the regen to both front load with damage and then heal up without having to take any breaks while leveling? Sounds realistic. Literally the only difference between what I'm suggesting and what your suggesting is that kiting leaves you taking less damage overall while still having the same output. I fail to see how that is somehow worse. 
---
Why are people so much obsessed with an idea to fix stuff which is not broken? The most crucial flaws (like you have to maintain rank) are fixed already as patch 1.12.
---
People are not very honest when they are using "unhealthy playstyle" argument - why don't you just make a little step further and limit the amount of time you can play, for example 8h max per  day.  
---
But the hard truth is that you want to have these r12-r14 rewards. But you can't handle the grind because reasons. 
---
You can cope with some people having more gold, you will accumulate enough for your needs eventually. You may get lucky with epic item drops and get the same awesome tier set the other guy owns. 
---
But people can't get rid of a crippling thought that they will never ever get those dope r12+ rewards. You are not entitled to own this gear. And here the "can we have changes plsss" begins.

How's progress on Lucifron? (j/k)
---
https://youtu.be/lXMguMnsyak
---
Let me leave this here for you.
---
Yeah but they don't. If the point of world buffs is to use them when you won't wipe then they are used on farm, and you'll spend more time getting them than you are saving. Makes zero sense. 
---
And what did rag do if nobody was in melee? Fire resistance was very important.
---
The gnome int is nice but people rather pick them for the cc removal or for flavor. Stun resist is huge in PvP, but noone cares for your PvP race, not even premades.
---
As for Fear Wards: If a HC guild has the choice between lets say an equally skilled and geared Dwarf Priest vs Human/NE Priest and both seem nice people will they prefer the Dwarf? Probably yes. But that is a super niche situation.
---
Keep in mind that very good guilds recruit differently. Pseudo HC guilds who recruit strictly for race/class combos are ridiculous and should be avoided by good players. If you are already in a very strong guild before you level up then people will ofc discuss this and maybe you'll be pressed to take a dwarf, but even then I doubt anyone would fault you for not doing so. Again niche situation. But in terms of recruiting people look for *how* you play rather than what you play. Good, dedicated players are a rarity and moreso healers.
---
Again, good players naturally gravitate towards eachother because they recognize skill and dedication. Your gear, mount, enchants, PvP rank and more importantly your behaviour and ability in PUGs/5mans etc. Have a much greater impact on who you play with than your race choice or even class/spec.
---
Those who do these strict class/race combo recruitments are not only rare even amongst HC guilds but also ridiculous. People who put that on their priority list basically have it upside down even from a HC perspective. A skilled player who is dedicated to their guild, is efficient at getting gear/consumables on their own has much more worth to a good guild than someone who chose the superiour race/class combo because they read it on reddit.
---
If you don't have the time to stay for an entire raid night maybe you shouldn't be in a raiding guild? 
---
😂
---
You have to go through felwood and TMH, so you'd wait till your 50's to do that right?
---
On the other hand, scraping together a ragtag team and journeying far into enemy territory to do it is a tried and true horde tradition. Especially if it's just to get your rogue buddy some gear.
---
At least the silver lining of that would be that the classic team is following the old blizzard standards of "Soon(tm)" and "when it's ready"

But I want to be able to add trinkets, rings and amulet.

Also, having separate monitors means you can purchase your monitors for separate things. For instance I have a 144 hz TN panel as my main monitor and a 60 hz IPS as my secondary. TN panels have a quicker response time than IPS panels, but they dont display colors or brightness as well as an IPS, and the viewing angle on the tn is awful (but that doesnt matter because it's the main monitor). 
---
The issue with Ashenvale has always been the lvl gap when actual contact between the factions happen. Horde reaches the western part at the end of their journey through ashenvale - So they walk into low level NE.
---
Meanwhile the NE who are past the quests of Astranaar walk into squishy horde players.  
---
Sure for the derps who get a kick out of a no challenge 'I squish low levels' fight its fun. But that's sadly not really a good example for well designed confrontations. Same goes for Feralas mind you
---
Tanaris and STV do a much better job on that front as both factions basically go after the same targets at a same-ish lvl range
---
Yep that's what i'm saying. Preraid-bis feral with consumables beats preraid-bis hunter with consumables 100% of the time in MC.
---
Premades happened, and premades are going to happen, and if you want rank - you're going to premade. You're going to play WSG until your head explodes, and you're going to love it. Sorry
---
One thing to consider that no one else has said yet, but there are low level wands that you can craft and sell on a fresh start server. The first wand that is available from a vendor is level 15 req, but the enchanting ones are level 7 and 13, and fairly easy to craft. 
---
Look, hardcore guilds don't approach raiding thinking how they could cut down on time spent ingame. Their primary concern is getting as much as they can out of each raid reset. Consumables and worldbuffs are a way of doing that. If you don't like it, don't join a hardcore guild.
---
Auto shot
---
Trouble is that people can get influenced by the constant barrage of these memes to justify now inviting a hybrid to as easy a raid as mc despite their gear/effort. Or a 5mam for that matter. 
---
IDGAF, traveling to dungeons was the shit.
---
Getting a group (especially a pug) together and meeting at a dungeon entrance was an accomplishment all on its own. It made the dungeons feel that much more special.
---
Reverting items wouldn't even make a difference when we're ignoring the biggest factor of trivializing raids in phase 1 and 3, the talents. The talent tree's we'll have access to weren't even available until naxx progression. Kinda confuses me how purists are so anal about minor things like spell effect, but don't seem to care about items and talents not being like they were at launch.
---
And as a warrior you'll have plenty of corpse running anyway :D
---
In this case I think getting the Aszhara FP fixes this and makes it much quicker. Alternatively you could take the boat from Theramore &gt; Menethil &gt; Darkshore which I think is faster but requires you to be actively playing. 
---
You know that it's the worst possible situation if this website actually is right with their prediction. Because this means that Acti-Bliz has once again enforced a release date instead of sticking to the original concept of 'it will ship when its done/ready'
---
100 days is way too long fck that next week
---
If you’re just going to quest yeah Shadow is the way to go. However, Holy priests are sought after for being reliable and strong healers. Being a holy priest almost guarantees a spot in a group.

This 100%.

If Tauren get Plainsrunning then Undead get to be undead.
---
Hello there.
---
My question is : will we be able to use add-ons in classic? Are there going to be any? 
---
Yeah, I think I watched the same video as you, but I've always felt iffy about Progressive Itemization. I kinda support it and I kinda don't. I CERTAINLY don't expect it.
---
Blizzard said we are getting 1.12 as that was "the most complete version of Vanilla". They are progressively releasing the raids and world bosses out of a necessity to not invalidate end game content due to an overflow of endgame content. 
---
Here's why I don't think Progressive Itemization is going to happen:
---
- We were told 1.12 was the version we would be receiving. This is what we should expect, all the content at the 1.12 level. None of the items, even from the blue post about the 1.10 gear release schedule, are being altered. They are simply not going to show up until later.
---
- Items that were changed over time *will and should have their 1.12 itemizations*. Not only was that what we were promised, but the fact is loot will be distributed not based on what is good NOW, but good later. That is, personally, something that is not an accurate interpretation of Vanilla WoW, as no one had foresight and could see what the gear would shape out to be.
---
- Blizzard won't spend their time picking and choosing what patches to *inaccurately* slap onto each release phase for itemization. That would take too much time and would still contain gear that would trivialize content at some point in the timeline.
---
It is a problem made out of the air, as *we have been told that we are receiving 1.12 Vanilla WoW, not anything else*. Asking for anything other than version 1.12 is unrealistic. We have convinced them to delay the release of some powerful items that were already within 1.12 (which I'm ok with), but I can't agree that Blizzard needs to go through all (or even most) of these powerful items (in a list that was made to appear inexhaustible, or "tip-of-the-iceberg" to be exact) and decide what patch is balanced enough for the current content release phase, and then change the itemization of each of the items along their content phase plan. All items would, of course, have to be gone through. Otherwise, there's going to be some piece of gear out there that at least one class can use that will help them trivialize content, and that's just as unacceptable as if you left all of the items in.
---
They'll effectively be altering the balance of each patch based on their current personal thoughts on when and how to stagger these itemization changes, not by how it was back in Vanilla itself. Because of that, it's strange that any no-change advocate would ask for such a thing.
---
The only reason why I kinda support it is because I would like the content to be balanced more closely to what it was supposed to be like back then during each patch. That is not, however, realistic, as Blizzard doesn't have the data for all of Vanilla.
---
**Classic is not and will not be like Vanilla release when it releases.** It is supposed to be 1.12, with a dire necessity to stagger content release in the game. Asking for it to be anything other than that must also advocate for the alteration of the 1.12 data, for the purpose of hopefully emulating something that happened in Vanilla. That is not a no-changes ideal (no changer implying no changes to the 1.12 data, I know some want Classic to emulate all of Vanilla, which is unrealistic).
---

---
No, if you want to win, and no BGs won't be available at launch. Here's what will happen...You'll hit 60 and want to PvP. You'll wait for the patch with BGs, and by then people will have cleared MC and Ony and have farmed out the BiS pieces for their class. You'll join in quest items and get rolled by guildmates who farmed their gear together.  You might even be the best \_\_\_\_\_\_ on your server....but this is vanilla WoW where time-sink &gt; skill (which is what ranking is). After those full T1 folks are full T2 and you're still in greens and blues, it will get much worse. The flag runners will be unkillable to you and they will have their unkillable healer buddies with them. You will get 5 capped in AB. You might be OK farming AV except when the raiders get a wild hair and decide to attend.
---
At least get BiS blues from 5 mans so you have a chance. People decked out in PvE gear are going to have a huge advantage in PvP, unless you're rank 13/14. Rank 10 gear is pretty decent blues but still not great.
---
Yes, however they will have to be new Addons as the client will not be the same as it was in vanilla. 
---
If we get a beta, people should be able to start making Addons before release. 
---
Wow you had an LCD screen? CRT master race! :D
---
Seriously though I remember when I upgraded from 512 MB RAM to 768 MB. That boost was sick!
---
Today with 48 GB RAM I think I will not re-live this excitement. 
---
i guarantee that in MC i could do more dps on a ret pala than all the slacking warriors and rogues who inevitably show up to raids.  i dont plan on joining the ultra min/max tryhard guilds cos thats not fun for me
---
but tbh i'm mainly just trolling my old guildies, i'll almost definitely be holy
---
You know we are
---
🌶
---
Yeah, very true. It would show that they really had this date planned all along.
---
I mean at the end of the day, they are a business, and there are strategic ways of releasing a game, so saying "we'll release it when it's ready" simply isn't true. They wouldn't, for example, release classic 2 weeks after BfA launched, even if it were ready. They'd be adding in competition for their own game. Instead, they'll use the classic release to recharge their playerbase in a dip in activity.
---
We would do the group, and watch on the map and/or by the 'who' command their location.  If they didn't move within 5 minutes (bathroom break, grabbing a snack or drink, etc.) -- then they were just dumped from the group.  Don't have time for slackers or those who feel their privileged.  This includes those 'elusive' tanks who say... "No summon, no tank."  We're never desperate enough to give in -- and there's an app called "Extended friends list" wherein you can keep comments about players on your server.  Comes in handy when they app to your guild.  :)
---
&gt;middle of the pack
---
Just above the tanks, healers, and people who died
---
Which is why I’m sad Classic is starting at 1.12. Weak hunters and shitty AV. 
---
Yes.
---
Ret palas deal more dmg than hunters in naxx :) 
---
Enh sham can be seen blowing out the candle
---
Yes but how do you get more out of your weekly MC clear if you do it in 90 minutes instead of 120? Especially if you have to spend an hour going around getting various buffs? The math doesn't make sense, it's just incredibly stupid. 
---
I tried ulteawide but I dont like it. Had to move my head to much while playing, cant pay attenion what happens in the corners of your screen. 
---
Second sreen is just way ti handy for everything. I also play Wow windowed mode so I can move my mouse out of my main screen without alt-tabbing.
---
It’s fine kuz t1 is the only good looking set on Tauren imo
---
As Horde I did shimmering flats every character because the quests were so good. I remember getting ganked there but I also remember it was tolerable. STV was pretty bad, but my tactic was to never take the main roads and just kill everything on the way to where I was going and try to stay LOS and watch my surroundings. Hillsbrad wasn't quite as bad as I expected, but I was mentally prepared to corpse run a lot. As horde you can pick off a few quests that are somewhat safe.
---
Gankistan/Tanaris IS THE WORST. Nowhere to hide.  EPL/Sillithus/WPL are going to be painful for whoever the minority faction is too, so those are my top picks for worst. You will be doing those well after you ding 60.
---
OHH I'm thinking of winterspring wamp wamp

Depends on VPN if you’d come from the same public IP but it would be impossible to tell if it was you or another person if you’re both using the same VPN service provider.

Though if blizzard are using other metrics to determine whom is playing what account you might still get caught out.
---
Probably more trouble than it’s worth for you &amp; blizzard tho
---
Right.  Please spec into shadow weaving, put the rest into healing talents, and heal like the motherfucking class you play.
---
Also, keep shadow weaving procced.  Thanks.
---
19s 19c, too... talk about breaking the bank
---
If we're talking about optimal raid comps, then shadow weaving will be applied by a holy priest spec'd deep enough into shadow to pick it up.

Man, Steady Shot was a godsend in TBC. That alone flipped the script when it came to Hunter DPS. That, and Kill Command to a lesser extent.

shadowpriests can wildly out-dps hunters, I don't even know why they're included in this image.
---
Nobody uses worldbuffs in MC unless they're speedrunning. That's a whole another matter - speedrunners do ridiculous things to prove that they can. You can tell the guy who finished Super Mario Bros in under 5 minutes that all the time he spent preparing was wasted, but he likely won't care.
---
It doesn't sound like you're very familiar with the current private server regrowth meta.  Relies on regrowth spam, relies on using all of your mana and innervate/mana pots/runes to keep going.
---
Used by Druids to top/compete on healing meters
---
MAD respect.
---
You do know they did the same thing with the cata release date? They said there was a 12.7% chance of a cataclysmic event happening, and it indeed did release on the 7th December.  
---
None of the videos you linked had ANY dps data for feral druids in MC, so i dont know what you're talking about.
---
And Blizzard might do that later. For the first time though, I just want vanilla and not a Frankenstein's monster of a server. 
---
Progressive itemization adds a tiny amount of opaque nuance to the BiS hunt for obsessive min-maxers at the cost of *drastically* *changing equipped items* across the server, introducing uncertainty and breaking the immersion of fixed gear properties. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for why this tradeoff is worth making.
---
My priest died to rogues pretty easily, and geared warriors. The tradeoff is really that you can dispell and that's handy if you want to remove druid hots, mage shields, etc. Priest feels like you run out of mana fast and you're always drinking. If you give out A SINGLE stam buff, you'll have to drink. If you want to give out stam buffs as you see people, you'll always drink.
---
Also another downside that you'll  have that you didn't with a paladin is viper sting. Paladin cleanse removes everything except curses, priests are fucked on poison and all of the hunters will know to viper sting you. You'll get sheeped by mages and viper stinged into oblivion. At least with a paladin, your cleanse costs less mana than the actual viper sting so you can laugh it off.  You also have that insane bubble and lay on hands, which you don't have as a priest.
---
Paladin is just the ultimate terminator-like PvP healing machine. Weaker against casters stronger against melee, but I would say stronger overall. Priest is very squishy but still very good at keep people alive. Do what you like of course, but if I have it to do over again (which I do), I'm going Paladin all the way.
---
Says I'll be playing as a hearthstone, guess I'm roleplaying an innkeeper
---
Yeah, the plan is to play a class that can tank or heal on the way up, and then off-tank or heal (as needed) in the endgame. I'm fine with either role so I'll do whatever the guild needs dictate. We have at least one warrior tank set up for raiding but I'm not sure she can get to 60 quick enough and our core 5 priority will be to grab the UBRS key so we can start the Ony attunements.
---
We are already getting a Frankenstein's monster. It's not an authentic Vanilla wow experience.
---
I plan on going mage. I will go tailoring and herbalism. After I aquire Robe of the Archmage, tailoring will be pretty useless.. unless paired with enchanting as you can disenchant whatever you craft in tailoring. However, after getting Robe of the Archmage, I’ll probably go Herb/Alchy or Alchy/Enchant, to be self sufficient in regards to enchant, potions and gold making. 
---
Steady shot gave us something more to do but it was scaling being adjusted thst fixed hunters. All those melee AP only buffs starting to aplly to range AP also, ability coeficients scaling properly with AP, even the pets getting buffed iirc.
---
Just built mine. 8700k, 1080 to, 16g 3200 Corsair ram, 850 gold power supply,
---
Think Blue Dragon is better for overall mana reg than Shard of the Scale but I could be wrong... Rejuvenation Gem is the one trinket every healer goes apeshit for.
---
Alright, sounds good. Thanks for the answer 
---
Yes even in BfA FPS is dramatically different when you compare vanilla zones to BfA zones. Thats why I always chuckle when I see those "WoW Intel HD fps test" videos with footage from starting zones. Ah sweet 60fps...
---
Are finnish allowed?
---
Yessir.  I recently built a monster with a 2080ti Founders Ed, an i9 processor, 32GB of RAM and a 240hz monitor.
---
I actually built it for other games, and I feel somewhat goofy that I'm going to use it so heavily on WoW and have recently been enjoying such graphical intensive games as Crypt of the NecroDancer, yet here we are.
---
Every time you go out questing, you would save up like 10g from vebdoring items.
---
Then you get back, and realize you havent learned spells for 4 levels.
---
By the time you leave the major city, 65% of all your gold was spent on vital skill upgrades.
---
While you're correct, that build is still pretty overkill, even for 7.3.5
---
Coz they oom
---
A frikkin 15" Dell LCD screen. And it was black, ulike the standard white monitors at the time. 
---
Haha, I feel you dude. I had 256 MB ram and 64 MB graphics card. The game ran beyond bad! I could not enter Ironforge, because the framerate was so bad that it would have been more meaningfull to measure it in "frames per minute". Also, loading a new continent took me forever. I just barely made it to dry land before the ship would set sail. 
---
A few day's later, I looted my piggy bank and uppgraded to 1024 MB Ram and a graphics card with 256 MB memory. 
---
If you want to complete as many quests as possible before they turn gray, then you’ll need to plan out your route accordingly so that you visit each starter zone before you continue on to the follow-up zones. And yes, you can complete nearly all night elf quests in Teldrassil, despite being human. If spillover rep works as it should, then you’ll also benefit from completing human, dwarf and gnome quests as well.
---
I’m in the process of developing an Alliance Quest Completionist Guide for that very purpose, which can be found here:

---
i7 9700k RTX2080 + RoG GSync 4k. My body is ready.
---
Yeah obviously I was not implying otherwise 
---
With the way warriors and melee in general are broken I'd say that the raiding part of the game is already gonna be destroyed.
---
I loved the way that a Dwarf looks on a Nelf cat. Mount.  (Actually, I like the Nelf mount most out of all racial mounts). While level my Dwarf Hunter alt, I did every single elf quest after I decided to go for the Nelf Cat.  I did a lot of quests that were grey at the time, so I’ll probably  consider questing in teldrassil and darkshore.  
---
Tyvm for the post and replies, it's really helpful! 
---
In early days wow, it was difficult to get together 40 people at lvl 60 per week.
---
Getting to lvl 60 was kind of a litmus test, and then MC or Onyxia was really the trial by fire.
---
You had to be not only good, but dedicated in the time you were putting in each week for DKP.
---
Top tier for half the game is more than can be said for most classes. It certainly means a good contribution to raid DPS, which is what the post is about.
---
Well that's impossible. But let's keep it as close as possible. 
---
On a sidenote, I would really like Blizzard to some time in the future release the vanilla IP so that anyone can legally make a server with whatever changes they want. There are so many good ideas that exist on the private server forums that are impossible to make because Blizzard will just take them down and they can't be promoted.
---
Why aren't you posting any of the data? You're the one saying druids beat hunters at all points of the game in DPS, so surely you have some.
---
If only classic had raytracing 😂 nice build dude.
---
Really only Paladins can handle being focused. Druids can get away from their attackers but the heals are generally hard to get off. Priests and shamans will needs peels
---
There's a Swede here who'd love to play as a Shadow Priest again!
---
The Eagles are decent, I specially enjoy Hotel California.
---
Kalimdor was the name given to the original contient pre-sundering. The Eastern Kingdoms used to be attached to Kalimdor as well. Since the Night Elves stayed on the west half it continued to be called Kalimdor while the Eastern part was abandoned for the most part by the Night Elves other than a few travellers and the exiled Highborne who became the pink High Elves.
---
can people of your kind go back to the garbage mainstream gaiming market already and stop bothering with classic?
---
Lots of folks complain about the devilsaur mafia, but I've still yet to see a compelling argument of how this isn't just a great example of emergent gameplay at it's finest.  I get that it's frustrating, but if the mechanics of the game allow for it, it's not against the rules, what exactly is the problem here?
---
I have a 32” 1440p 144hz monitor. I’m honestly thinking about buying a 34” ultrawide same specs. Someone stop me please I have a mortgage!
---
Why is it impossible to just do a timed released of each patch exactly as it as in Vanilla?
---
It isn't. We just don't want to play the buggy, imbalanced mess that early versions of the game were.
---
I don't want Tier 2 pieces dropping in MC.
---
That's why I'm glad we have CHANGES.
---
Same exact build here. Enjoy it dude crushes whatever I throw at it.
---
Hi, /u/Whatley187
---
I just have my own experience. I don't see why the burden has to be on me to disprove that hunters beat feral druids in DPS like it's a law of nature.
---
It's fine if people don't believe me. I think if you ask almost any high end raiding feral druid if they beat hunters in MC, all consumables allowed, they'd say yea. 
---
This is all valid, but I think you guys are also overlooking the super obvious strategy of siblings or a dedicated friend group literally sharing a physical location to accomplish this as well.
---
Same. BFD doesn't seem to make many top-lists for dungeons, but I always enjoyed it. The entrance is located on the beautiful Zoram Strand and is very cool. You run down these ramps into the the damp underground ruins and swim in.
---
Furthermore, it's a pretty big dungeons with hidden areas and bosses, (Old Serra'kis enyone?) and it ends in an Old God temple. All-in-all a very underappreciated dungeon imo!
---
Yes you can. You just need to be friendly. I'm not sure if you start friendly with Night Elves as a Human though.
---
Sister and I wanna level together. She’s going nelf rogue, what should I roll as a Nelf? 
---
What are you talking about? The gameplay will still be there. Raid and dungeon mechanics won’t change. Making the game have a bit better itemization or some improved talents can only bring a healthier game.
---
For anybody who doesn’t know what this is a reference to... plz at the very least YouTube “Full Metal Jacket Drill Sargent scene” it will make your day 
---
The best synergy with a Rogue IMO is a Druid.  As a pair, you'll have someone who can tank/heal dungeons for quicker groups, and the two of you will have way less downtime plus the ability to stealth through quests together where appropriate.  You'd share gear but I wouldn't worry too much about gear when leveling anyway.
---
Wipe if it weren't for starshard.
---
I'm just gonna spec into full healing if I have to heal. No way I'm running a gimped healing spec just to buff the warlocks, get a shadow priest if you want that 
---
If you're ignoring mp5 then yes 
---
Don’t have to worry about down ranking as much. PvP fights are generally shorter and you can get out of combat to drink or die and rez. Healing PvP is enjoyable, you use every cool down you have and each fight/situation is unique. 
---
Hunters in vanilla have the most involved gameplay in pve raids of any class, an actual rotation and takes some skill to master, has 2-3 different viable pve raid specs, and is also a top tier and high skill cap pvp class with many specs to choose from. In tbc hunters relative dps increased, but they specced BM the whole expansion in both pvp and pve, and it was the start of the infamous "1 button rotation" macro for hunters, where you put all the spells you needed into a single macro that you spammed the entire raid to do max dps.  Yes hunter dps was relatively better in tbc, but the class as a whole got absolutely gutted, perhaps the only class that got less interesting and fun to play compared to vanilla. In my opinion of course. 
---
They'll be new characters. People are probably talking about recreating their original vanilla characters.
---
No, at the same level as warlocks that don't put in the effort.
---
I believe the saying goes, "You have to kill a paladin three times." So that's the way to go if you want to be hard to focus.
---
Absolutely, trying to even get rank 13 nearly ruined my life when vanilla first came out, a game marketed at teenagers shouldn't hold such a carrot in front of a group of people with extremely poor decision making and impulse control. 
---
I was basically a walking zombie, I slept maybe 4 hours a night, would sleep through classes at school, neglect doing homework, neglected, chores, pretended I was sick so I could stay home, and in spite of all that I still never got it. There was just never enough time.
---
Whoa, now there's a throwback website!  Welcome back bro.  You owned a spot on my bookmark bar a solid 4 years back in the day.
---
Anything that can be fiddled one way can be fiddled back. 
---
Im very relutant in paying 13€ a month for a 15year old game, no material how good it is. They really are milking this franchise. Could spens that on a game pass like ps now and play a bunch of different games. But for some reason everytime I come to this subreddit, every screenshot of the game makes me tickle inside and desperte for the release of this masterpiece. It really was love at first sight 15years ago. We miss you Blizzard.
---
2. Probably gameplay wise, they needed the transition to the later levels especially because at the time they didn't have as many quests. Or so I heard: extra quests came in one of the vanilla patches.
---
3. I agree with them; watching the class design panel, it was better to keep certain gameplay functions exclusive to some classes.
---
I think all the classes had enough in their toolkit, but maybe I'm biased to how good I think vanilla is.
---
TBC brought stuff like Bloodlust and Slow. However I feel classes like the warrior already had enough on their plate at the time, adding something like shockwave would be a bit too much.
---
Druids got force of nature in TBC, which summons 3 treants. 
---
Vanilla was awesome, but it wasn't perfect, and I'm sure the devs didn't foresee the complete meta until they wanted to start giving hybrids some more oomf in TBC.
---
Yeah I get that, but it feeds misinformation about certain specs being unplayable and encourages the "lmao lolret", "lmao not grouping with a feral" and "lmao bad just play Xrole/spec" mentality.
---
Plus this is a forum for discussion, I was discussing.
---
Because their oldest code was from 1.12.1, the database can be edited but the mechanics can't. So we won't have negative resists, wall jumping etc. I would really like the talents to be changed back to previous patches, which definitely should be possible.
---
You don’t accept Danes? ( 
---
No dps warriors then since they should tank like the mfing class they play?
---
There are literally 40 spots in raids. Who cares if Balance druids or enhancement shamans dps?
---
No changes means no changes. Or if you embrace the obvious necessity of changes, then all specs should be on the table.
---
It's really not all that radical, changes happened throughout Vanilla.
---
Shamans normally dont go full healer in terms of spec, because their last skill points are just so useless for PvP. You invest 5 points in manatotem which gets destroyed or outranged, the 31 talent is a good totem that unfortunately also gets destroyed and has a 5min cooldown.
---
Therefore most shamans go elemental to heal + purge + burst. 
---
Priests do the mainload of the defensive dispells as horde does not have paladins. They also do most of the healing. So they are the bread and butter in regards of healing in a premade.
---
Druids arent really that good as healers, they rather go as FCs.
---
Regarding R14 it will depend how Blizzard implements the weapons. If the healing mace and spelldamage dagger is gated and does not get released with the proper melee weapons and such, most casters will not go R14 as their 1handers and 2handers do not hold up too well against BWL items such as Lok'amir or Chromaggus dagger.
---
Way to end your argument on a super strong point. 
---
Yep. I did exactly that back in the day. On some fights, you'd wish you had Improved Renew, but you can make do with some smart healing.
---
Nope sure won’t.  You change one thing it changes it all.  This is why people like you can’t grasp this stuff because you are only looking at raiding as the meat and potatoes of the game, when it isn’t.  I understand why you think that because that’s what it has been in retail since wotlk, but in vanilla it’s not.
---
For example, hunters are insanely good in pvp in vanilla, especially world pvp.  Their issues don’t really come from mana but just raw damage, you buff their damage and they will completely destroy in pvp.  Or let’s say you change priests or boomkins damage.  What’s the point of even being a pure damage spell caster anymore?  It changes the whole game.  
---
Saying itemization doesn’t change the game is actually hilarious to me.  I guess you must have forgotten what items like shadowmourne did to the game.  A single item changed the meta of arenas completely when it was introduced.   
---
&gt; Also, there was an NPC offering a buff every hour. As with vanilla buffs, there was nothing such as Battle Elixir or buffs replacing buffs, so it would stack with any other buffs. **It would disappear upon entering raid, though.** 
---
You probably just misremember this, but thats not true. You would keep the buff upon entering raids.
---
You can see the buff active in Nihilums Kel'Thuzad kill: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN\_Cn2L2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A) 
---
&gt;Hunter falls back at AQ and Naxx compared to pure dps classes, still viable dps and necessary for tranq, trueshot..
---
Pure DPS like fury warriors.
---
2 Hunters out of 40 is optimal in Naxx.
---
I have to say that for the most part, I agree. 
---
However the Devilsaur Mafia, is based around opposing factions, working together to have the monopoly on the market. This is not allowed and is done/unable to be tracked due to the sheer number of "Out of Game" chat devices that are now available.
---
There lays the difference between AH playing and the Devilsaur Mafia. 
---
I've never understood the point of posts like this, regardless of what they're about.
---
Yes someone on the internet disagrees with you. You really need to make a screenshot and share it on some place filled with people who don't?
---
Yeah, it’s not perfect there’s hard counter classes for everyone. Priests don’t have it any easier against shamans either. Still, paladins are amazing PvP healers. Viper sting? Cleanse. Sheep? Sacrifice. Rogue? lol plate and shield. Mage? lol blessing of freedom. It’s quite good you’d have to agree. Lot of utility and high survival 
---
We are keeping norwegian as the language for both guildchat and discord, so unfortunately no 😞 I wish you luck finding a similar minded guild however!
---
Only really good for Priests and Druid, and then only in later tiers when you start getting more spirit and the fights last long enough that you need the additional mana.
---
It's a very good trinket though.
---
Skullflame shield. Best looking item in the game. And Teebus blazing longnsword. 
---
Did tips even play Vanilla wow?
---
Retail players pay for NEW endgame.  Classic players don't.
---
They won't require new expansions to play Classic.
---
I like how people are so against me as if i'm just making stuff up when they're doing the exact same thing.
---
"hunters are a top 1 contender for DPS in MC"
---
"no they're not, in fact a feral druid will beat a hunter"
---
"PROVE IT!!"
---
Like serioulsy guys. All i'm saying is that on a boss fight a feral druid will out dps a hunter in MC. That's it. If you think differently then fine, but it's both just our opinions, it's not like either side has any proof that i've seen.
---
My personal preference is to start off by putting 2/3 Imp. Blizzard and then going lower in the talent tree, my reasoning is that I prefer using CoC as my ”oh shit”-button at lower levels.
---
After imp. CoC I’ll put the last point for 3/3 at which point I’ll use CoC every pull. With both Ice Barrier and Ice Block the override doesnt matter as much. 
---
Thats what I recall from 14 year old memories at least, super stoked to do it again this summer. 
---
sounds like hes desperate to pretend ferals are a viable dps source for raiding. sometimes its best to let people their believes.
---
I subbed to pewdiepie before the TSeries war, does that count?
---
I have 2 and its always been great. People tell me to get an UW buti cant see myself liking it. 
---
I mean I didn’t build it just for WoW Classic, but yes this is going to happen and it will be GLORIOUS!  I played Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath on a white plastic MacBook.

Do you think trash packs matter?
---
How many thousands of manual crowd pummelers :  1,000 or 10,000?
---
It's not so much that it's a grind. There's a spectrum of fun grinding and tedious grinding. Classic WoW PvP ranking leans heavily towards the latter category.
---
There are things that are definitely broken about the system. In a lot of ways it forces people to sacrifice fun to increase numbers, which is exactly what results in a tedious grinding situation.
---
People are forced into premades, although playing within a premade or going up against a premade is really a waste of time for everyone involved. Players would rather have a challenging conflict which would be either PuG v. PuG or Premade v. Premade. However when PuGs go against Premades the PuGs just afk while the Premade goes around capping everything without a challenge, and when Premades go against Premades they just dodge each other because the system doesn't reward Honor based on challenge, so it's a waste of time for everyone involved.
---
This results in the ironic situation that if you want to actually have fun and be challenged in PvP you don't join a Premade, but if you want to actually progress in PvP rank you join a Premade. The entire system is broken.
---
Within those premades, there's collusion for who gets to rank up each week. People calculate their honor so that the specific people for that week get to progress. This isn't realistic, or fun.
---
You need to get the Azshara flight point, that's why.
---
Not ooming like warlocks? 
---
Maybe :)
---
Depends on your norwegian skills. If you can understand us and we can understand you, it probably wont be a problem. Just dont start this "halv fjærs" crap when it comes to numbers and you're halfway in 😂
---
I used to think that the food shop in Orgrimmar was a shoulder store because the picture of a ham on the sign looked like shoulder piece to me. 
---
Well said
---
Yeah they never oom at the cost of the healers mana.  Try again :) 
---
Are there any weapon procs that benefit casters?
---
that's the classic experience.   
---
If you make it easier (read: less time consuming, less intensive commitment requirements). That messes with the entire balance of the game.  
---
If everyone can reasonably expect to get rank 14 or even rank 10, much gear from instances and crafting is made obsolete.  
---
The insentive to do raids and dungeons severely drops, when you could just be spending that time afk in a bg to get your welfare pvp gear.
---
Thank you so much
---
Druid/priest is good with rogue
---
Hahah omg. Halvfjerds or sytti, does it matter? 
---
Nah, I’m actually pretty good at understanding you guys. Or so I like to think.  😄
---
Classic wow will kill retail. Mark my words
---
"15 fucking years later WoW is still some tab target MMORPG. "
---
The tab target combat system is what makes it the type of game it is. I mean I do like the slightly more action oriented combat of games like Tera Online but at the end of the day WoW hasn't changed this because it's working.
---
He said top contender DURING preraid, MC, and onyxia
---
You can usually get away with 1 for every 2 bosses. Takes 5-10mins to farm one, so it's about an hour a week if you wanna raid MC. Hardcore shit i know.
---
I played a while on vanilla but didnt even raid. Was just a kid rerrolling everytime I saw a cooler dude in Ogrimmar. Today I can only play for like and hour on work days and a couple more on freedays, guess Im gonna take like 3 months to lvl my question is can I even think about raiding in vanila with so little played time? 
---
So I’m in the minority, but I’ve come to prefer the simplicity of a single monitor + tablet setup, having done triple monitor, ultra wide, and more setups. I play in borderless window and can switch to a guide whenever if need be (although I’m going to try not to) but then can bring my Netflix/YouTube/Plex/whatever with me while i get more coffee, take a minute or two to walk around, etc. 
---
Obviously a dual monitor setup would work with this as well. 
---
I’m not saying it’s the best option for all, but for me, it works perfectly and cost a bit less. (Fire Tablet 10” is cheap)
---
You can sub without having current expac.
---
And they've given zero indication that Classic will release on July 16th.
---
Yep, since Classic will be using the 7.3.5 client (or higher?), we'll likely have access to all of those advanced graphics options not available in 1.12
---
You get 400% of your regen back while casting during Innervate. I'm going to take the published article's formula over yours when you don't even know how Innervate works.
---
Then we should have a beta already. I'm guessing late August.
---
Of course it changes the game, but then you adjust again until you get to a decent balance. The thing is the game has always undergone balances.
---
Take a look at other games like say, Diablo, Magic the Gathering, or even Smash Bros.
---
They don’t just release and call it good, they constantly tweak
---
Jk, I know you guys usually don't take kindly to finnish, that's why.
---
Then feel free to join the discord and see if this is something for you 👌
---
They pay for access to new content. The addition of Burning Crusade again would take enough work to be "new" or remixed enough to warrant buying again right? 
---
I mean I'm pretty sure we'll get base game free with sub but I'm mostly curious about the other stuff. 
---
Especially if we ask/demand them not to do the things that we hated in BC and then in Wrath. 
---
I feel like there were some even more outrageous ones in Eastern Kingdoms that could have you flying from Booty Bay, all the way the fuck up the the Plaguelands, then all the way back down to get to Blasted lands if you were missing certain flight points. 
---
You do realize anecdotal evidence is not proof right? I honestly don’t recall if anyone said gz but I would not be surprised in the slightest if people did. 
---
Nobody is saying it didn't happen, or that the classes are all in a great place. We just don't want to risk it getting worse. 
---
Classic isn't perfect in many ways, but we know exactly what we're getting, a tried and true experience, flaws and all.
---
LC is biased 
---
DKP is fair
---
hard/soft res in pugs works
---
Honestly I want to join a dkp guild even though my time is limited
---
If you get a Lupos then you actually kinda have a Ret like DPS pet.
---
Will actually be worth it if you have the hardware to put it out. WoW Classic at 165hz widescreen is gonna be glorious.
---
Good lord, I'm about to witness a karma homicide.
---
I could probably whip up a version for mac, but that will have to wait for the updated version which I'm gonna get to work on later tonight. Thanks for your feedback :)
---
he did afaik allthough im not sure what that has to do with the server data.
---
Don't you mean you will have a second mortgage soon?  ;-)
---
Exactly.  The game would get constantly tweaked and balanced and tweaked and balanced just like what happened in the past and look where we are at.  A vanilla where mages/rogues/warriors/warlocks aren’t THE top dps is NOT vanilla, no matter how you look at it.  Tbc without op SL/SL locks is not tbc.  Wotlk without shadowmourne being op in pvp is not wotlk.  
---
This game isn’t being made to tweak it and adjust it to make vanilla better, it’s being made to bring vanilla back as a museum piece, full stop. 
---
 Even though I’m for #nochanges, I kind of wish they would remaster classic with completely updated graphics like WC3Reforged.

i could be wrong but I believe azshara fp  is missing and that's why it takes this route could be wrong
---
Loot council is #1
---
Yeah, I've been thinking the same. If it really was going to be a July 16th date, we'd need to start hearing more real soon.
---
You are right about batriders. I don't recall dragonhawk riders. And I don't recall obsidian statues being in the game at all.
---
also what do you do with all the strange dust?
---
I like LC for modern smaller groups, do you think it will translate well to classic?
---
I brevet really learned how MP5 works. When people say priests need to get good at playing around the five second rule, what are they referring to?
---
It's his choice though. He doesn't have to stream classic at all. He CAN keep his identity a secret and have a good time. But nope, money is in the way. 
---
That and being able to just fucking buy a boost even further trivializes leveling and guts it of any meaning....and I despise the "hurrr durr I only have 30 mins a week to play, I shouldn't have to invest so much time into this game I CHOOSE TO PLAY". Equally irritating is the 'I paid for it, I should have access to everything' argument, which is also bullshit. Not being skilled enough to progress, and refusing to make any attempt at getting better, doesn't equate to being denied access. If people don't want to invest the time and effort necessary to succeed at a game..well, fuck them, there are thousands of other games where you can win without doing anything and without investing any time. 
---
Holy strike was in beta.
---
Lmao this is why I hated most mmorpgs after Wow
---
dude did you make a BiS for deadmines? 
---
It seems most guilds plan on using the LC system, though I have seen some cases of guilds using other systems, but Loot Council is very popular.
---
I remember our first rag kills we had a late wipe due to DPS issues. We were so close. Jump in office chat. We tell our officer who loves playing shadow and can do it well first thing we get in. "Nachos. Go shadow". "Ok". Next attempt he was down and Nachos killed the meter. 
---
ive got a i7-4790k, 16 GB of ram and a GTX 1080 and i mostly only play oldschool runescape and plan on playing a shit ton of classic when it comes out. **Overkill FTW**
---
I could only hit rank 12, it was tedious and fun, most of my matches were pugs. I disliked bgs for a while but now I think I’d do it again.
---
So pretty much it looks like the modern methodology of Discord+LC will remain the same for Classic? Is it weird that I was almost hoping to see some people using ancient guild sites, DKP and Ventrilo lol?
---
I agree with all of this, except I’d usually let the Raid Leader make the call.  They may have already decided that the current attempt isn’t going well enough in general to warrant the use of Battle Rez. 
---
I mean.. yes? I wasn't talking about raiding at all though.
---
Urgh playing as a horde in hillsbrad atm on a p-server, it’s a nightmare trying to finish the battle of hillsbrad questchain
---
The argument I see a lot is “if ret paladins did the same dps as a warrior and also brought buffs and offheals then why bring a warrior?”  
---
But really tho this argument doesn’t make any sense because if you look at retail where dps is more or less balanced, people still play as warrior... because they want to play warrior. 
---
It could work but it wouldn’t be the authentic vanilla experience which is the main goal.  There are unfortunate side effects of #nochanges such as class stacking and whatnot but I think I’d prefer the real thing instead of “vanilla 2.0”
---
Hey we can‘t Trust? Because it is blizzard we are Talking about, because sh*t happened before and the only way to minimize the risk of getting a shitty product is to make them get the product to the point where it was good. 
---
If everyone tells the devs what to do, there would be 1000 opinions and it would be a desaster. So it is easier to tell them „Go back as close as you can“ so they have a clear path to follow. 
---
Allthough i get your QoL concerns, but if you want to properly ret pala, you should go retail or live with a meme spec in classic. 
---
550 w PSU is kinda low for that build. 
---
Well yeah I know that, but that's why I just wanted a discussion. Feel kind of betrayed by the downvotes because I'm just trying to be earnest.
---
Hah, this is awesome!
---
The ganking falls off after level 50. At 60 you won’t experience much if any ganking.

400% of your mana regen while *not* casting, and 100% *while* casting.

Cool, thanks! :)

It's Booty Bay, right?

WTF with the resolution?
---
\*\*shakes head and walks out mumbling to himself\*\* 
---
Hey chum,
---
Do you know what level of enchanting you need to DE every piece of gear that Vanilla drops?
---
1.
---
You don't need to grind any reps, in order to get level 1 enchanting.
---
I have my doubts they'll do a public beta tbh, just internal friends and family
---
Wasn't the resurrection sickness debuff like 30mins in classic?  
---
I think Vanilla 2.0 could be something that comes later that people would enjoy. 
---
I can see their argument, but then why not just limit the group emphasis of a paladin if they choose to DPS? They'll fulfill their role, provide some off utility that is mediocre or less then. 
---
Essentially you don’t start regening mana until you stop all casting for 5 seconds. What this means is learning to front load spells ahead of time, (like as many of your dots as possible etc.) so you can get into regen mode as fast as possible 
---
Oh I mean I love the meme spec hardcore, but something as gentle as just giving them easier mana management couldnt be so bad, but I've got to admit i am short sighted on this as i really cant guess what the repercussions would be.
---
So what that's almost better. Fuck everything being safe and by the book. That's the problem now.. game developers are now corporate figures not just passionate artists. So everything is by the book according to maximizing profit.
---
The black market fits the game better in terms of role playing even. It's not mainstream so many people are encouraged not to do it or don't even know or trust it. When it's in the game it's easy and encouraged. Even when certain players do dab in the black market it's like not breaking immersion cause it seems to be shady characters doing shady dealings which every world has. Imagine some sleazeball in the alley ways of orvrimmar copping a stolen mount from a Russian farmer. Hey blizz should even consider it's inevitably and create a neutral faction choice so farmers can choose goblin as their race for lore reasons

---
You suggested that the problem was that we were not trusting the devs. 
---
We are not questioning the devs. 
---
You just cannot buff ret for example and expect the game to change only for them.
---
The problem is that the smallest class change will end up in landslide balance wise for everyone.
---
Yeah, IF you survive, which is a pretty big if. 
---
It would look like retail.

This is why everyone loves Nachos. His cheesy goodness, his variable spiciness, his guacamole, his shadow weaving
---
1. Kael’Thas and the Illidari (what we got in TBC for them was terrible). 
---
2. Garithos doesn’t get mentioned at all, which is bizarre. 
---
3. Mages have nothing to do with Dalaran (a real pity, they could’ve had Dalaran be for mages what moonglade is for druids, or at least let us see the ruins and have some questing there. At least we got to see Dalaran in WoTLK I guess).
---
Thank you very much, this is the type of stuff I want to see! I have been tempted to make a human paladin to join just such a guild. You could have stuff like Duskwood duty for initiates as a way to get your name out there; They would patrol around Duskwood helping players, spreading your influence, inspiring others with their general rp atmosphere. 
---
Did you play TBC or just ROC? (Honest question. Those are both TBC units so that might be it.)
---
Use a search function next time, there's like 20 of these types of threads posted here everyday.

Such a beautiful rhyme. School still is getting on the way of your WoW enjoyment.

---
Weigh your choices and watch videos that talk about it ( in a fair an open minded way,  not slanted like some vids ) and then rest easy in knowing that if you want to raid, you will get a chance.
---
I mean...what's going to happen? Are people going to whisper random dwarf priests saying "lol, fucking scrub min/maxer!"? 
---
LC is really popular on private servers even with casual guilds. And of course every guild has a Discord. You cannot function without one. 
---
Ok so you have spirit and you have Mp5.
---
Spirit increases the amount of mana and health you Regen out of combat.   In combat, your spirit will continue to Regen, if you don't cast for 5 seconds.   That is typically referred to as the 5 second rule.   If memory serves you can wait, 3.1 seconds and then cast a 2 second heal.  At the 5 second mark, you get the regen and the .1 second after the cast hits and you stop regeneration again.
---
Mp5 is much simpler.      If it says the effect is 10 mana per 5 seconds.   You simple get 10 mana every 5 seconds, so long as you are alive.
---
for sure
---
Payback for all those days rolling on everything (jk)
---
I was very saddened that I did not have my own account and my older brother forced me to roll alliance as he made an alliance toon.
---
I always was a tauren at heart and I wanted to make a tauren shaman so badly back then.
---
Alas, I were bewitched when I saw the horde premades roll over our group in WSG, seeing that mighty tauren twoshot me. I never felt bad, because I felt I belonged to the horde. 
---
Only on private servers a couple years ago I could really embrace my disgust with the alliance and make them pay on every step I took.
---
Sounds like something someone who doesn’t like progression would say.
---
lmao, who knew an archaic game from 15 years ago is ten times better than a modern mmorpg?
---
Must be 1 shitty mmorpg.
---
LC is superior
---
Ofc we need to be prepared. Not fun to play wow with 30 fps max. Even though I have a 1060 6gb, am still happy with it. Nice gpu.
---
Only dwarves had fear Ward in classic.... 
---
It will hurt financially. You’ll have to live on instant noodles and sell your car but sacrifices must be made!
---
DPS warriors top the meters. Shadow priests don't.
---
No that is a stupid assumption no offense. Buffing ret paladins to do damage that will make them existent in the dps meters will not cause any dramatic shifts.
---
Worried about pvp? Then buff ret pallies in a way that won’t buff the so called reckoning spec. Even the actual ret spec is shit in pvp
---
Also please don’t give me that stupid excuse that, “oh no but then there will be more competition for the gear” because that just goes against the mechanics of the game.
---
I really like EPGP, but it's quite hard to make it work. 
---
I totally understand your Point on changing things astranaar-like. It‘s just not manageable to implement things that aren‘t obvious. It‘s because... too many dumb people giving advice that The company then takes serious and we get something that just sucks. 
---
To Be honest, it‘s because we as a whole community aren‘t clever enough to get to one major opinion/solution. I could live with changes that i don‘t want, but too many can‘t
---
World PVP is "A" part of the game.
---
It is NOT a huge part to everyone.
---
Please for the love of elune can the pvp crowd understand that not everyone is wired that way. And those that arn't are not some minority. Don't make me whip out the server break down by type list again! ;-)
---
It's actually based on Legion engine. I can assure you it will require more than WoW did 2005.
---
That's awesome! I love hearing stories like that because as a wrath baby, they didn't really happen for me. The first time I entered MC was on a private server where everyone (except me) already knew everything there is to know about the raid so we just steamrolled through it. Definitely hit the brakes on my will to play vanilla. 
---
Later on I did get that feeling when we finally downed CT after almost a month of trying. It's still not the same though, or at least it sounds like it was more awesome back then. 
---
No one is really asking for ret to do as much as a warrior, just want them to do enough dps what would be good enough for raids
---
At first I didn't know what was up. I saw a ???? Rogue. Mounted in mulgore when I first logged in. Didnt even know it was a player.  Human. He one hit me. I wrote his name down and saw him our side of IF 9 months later will low health from a duel. I charged, execute.
---
Full time kiting is bad because it's much more APM than just face tanking mobs. It's absolutely not needed in a duo (and coordination is harder anyway).
---
I don't know many people that will level this way from lvl 1 to 60.
---
And you risk of pulling other mobs because running around is the best way to agro something you shouldn't.
---
So now you have to go full dps and full heal. You waste your mana and spend the next minute recovering or running from the graveyard.
---
Levelling is a marathon not a sprint.
---
Btw I levelled my first warrior with a priest in Vanilla. We never ever stoped for regen unless we pulled something big like 3 or 4 mobs (yeah shit happens \^\^) or attacked a big elite (devilsaurs in Ungoro).  
---
Obsidian statues: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Obsidian_destroyer
---
He came to explain the Law, not change the Law. Moneychangers? GTFO!
---
It's going to take you a lot more than 3 months, but you can definitely raid at 60 if you can be available for raid times.
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
Well, that's a bummer. Since I'm horde
---
There was a mortar team in vanilla! You have to recover ammo from near the yeti cave and deliver it south of kharanos to a mortar team. They even take shots at practice targets.
---
Zarlman Two Moons in Mulgore was a spirit walker. Obsidian statues/destroyers are found in AW. Gazlowe in ratchet was a tinker and Anubrekhan in Naxx was a cryptlord.
---
I still get your point but just some observations for those that are curious.
---
I was really thinking about going Shaman. That's a bit discouraging. :/
---
If it weren't for Steady Shot, post-deadzone hunters could've had a fun rotation involving frequent melee-ranged dancing.

Hi, /u/Peppiping
---
There are some tutorials on YouTube of an electronic shaman farming air packs in DM.   Definitely looks harder to do than say a mage, but he gets some packs down.
---
I don't think a shaman could do a tribute solo though
---
I'm ok with some qol stuff like flight path adjustments and bug fixes but anything that would change class balance I'm against.  That's coming from someone who is going to main a meme spec.

---
I get that LC is theoretically the best but whenever I see a guild looking for members and it says its a group of people who have been friends for 10 years and they'll be using loot council i know who will be getting all the loot.
---
I'm getting a 34" ultra wide.  When Borderlands 2 came out I bought a 3x 24" NVIDIA surround setup and it was a lot of fun but the support for most games was poor or nonexistent.  E.G. can't play DotA2 or WC2 on it.  You become peripheral blind to the bezels after playing a while.  I will say, you never will experience eye fatigue like playing on 3 monitors if you haven't before.  It sensory overload and everyone has to adjust to all the additional inputs.
---
For Classic I expect to drop the bezels and be able to leave my bags open while grinding.  Or have my raid frames up on the side and not block any action.  Being able to see the whole immersive skyline, this important to me.  It may be a little weird in small dungeons and caves, but we'll see.  I can get over that.
---
I wish I could have a chance to try before I buy, but I still feel confident I'll love it.
---
If they implement sharding like they have it in retail it will be far less than 200.  There aren’t even 200 people in Org these days.  
---
There are two options for raiding that I can see:
---
* Being in a raiding guild and raiding weekly (one day, two days, etc)
---
* Being in a PUG (pick-up group)
---
If you can't commit to raiding on the same day(s) every week then it might be hard to join a raiding guild (although some do accept socials and have alt/social raids. Joining/creating a PUG might be your best bet.
---
Since the game has been out for so long, and people have experienced the mechanics of those raid fights before, it might be easier to get into a PUG that it would have been in the past.
---
I would not worry about raiding at all until you've got yourself to max level - that's going to be a journey in itself!
---
In MC and early BWL, maybe.
---
Even then, why would you want to raid with people who are just slacking off and don't use consumables, if you're willing to put in the time and effort to get as much out of your character as possible?
---
At that point, wouldn't it make more sense to just play a spec that isn't garbage, to allow you to play with like-minded people?
---
LC in 40 mans is going to be hard to swallow for a lot of people when they never get loot. 
---
That wasn't what they were talking about.
---
Not this time around. Ran a guild without such limits in vanilla, and while it was an epic journey, it also had its limitations. Most people never said anything ot engaged in vocal discussuons because they had to speak English. Might not sound like a huge deal, but Im removing the language barrier in Classic to improve on what did not work so well last time 😊
---
Can't please em all!
---
Here is the HUGE problem with that.
---
You are ok with giving control over your life and decisions to some asshat!
---
Wait I only have 100 days to choose a class now? Fuck.
---
I wouldn't say rules, but you need awareness of the mechanics and timers.    I would always assume the person I was going to Rez was an idiot that stood in fire.   So to help them, make sure you aren't in fire.   Wait until after the big aoe to Rez them.  
---
Nothing worse than rezzing someone and they accept immediately and for again.
---
And don't Rez hunter pets.  Or hunters.
---
I played on a US west coast server from Korea, and the ping difference was hardly noticeable after the first day of playing. 
---
I logged on during the free weekend. Decided to tank an instance with a pally I had at level 39 from back in the day. Threw a few skills (captain America shield, consecration, and the taunt) onto my tool bar and said fuck it. Hopped into a dungeon and tanked  everything with such ease eventually I was just fucking around pulling every mob in sight and still we had no problem killing them all and the healer kept everyone at full health. 
---
Hah, I couldn’t even spend mana! My mana was always at 100% somehow and I was spamming consecration for fucks sake!
---
Why is fear ward so hyped even though only 8 bosses have fear abilities? I get the potential for PvP
---
They have potions and a self heal. The point was that they have a mana pot in a spell with no cd, try again.
---
I totally agree. Rp was great in the earlier versions of wow. No crazy mounts everywhere, no races not fitting in the horde and alliance, no lore breaking retcons in every expansions etc. Classic had that fantasy simplicity I love so much. I just can't lose and immerse myself in the modern versions of wow. It's gotten too much for it's own good. 
---
Let's hope Blizzard listens to us and gives us both types of Rp servers
---
It just depends on what you want to do. 100% healing is obviously off the table, however you really do mostly healing, then purging and only DPS in burst windows to secure a kill (if you are a good shaman, lots just want to be a worse version of a mage by just DPSing all game).
---
Imagine purging a character with fortitude and shield. That's 1500 "damage" dealt if you manage to purge these two buffs. Then you mostly heal and really only when the TC announces a kill target or you see a window of opportunity you strike. 
---
Utility is also immense. You anticipate an endurance fight? R1 earth shocks and frost shocks, purges only on the kill target, heal the rest of the time.
---
A great aspect of elemental is how the gear overlaps heavily with healing gear. The vast majority of items give +spell power and +healing power, so your healing will always be ramped up. 
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEbzqcMqZZVcIz0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEbzqcMqZZVcIz0xo) 
---
Such a spec is normally used to be a viable healer and a viablo DPSer. 
---
Mana (and health) regeneration ticks every 2 seconds if applicable. But the timing of the ticks has nothing to do with what the player is doing, so a player could get the regen tick anywhere between 5 and 7 seconds after the last time they used mana.
---
Yeah and that’s part of their tool kit, which kills them, it isn’t free mana by any means it can only be used when you are safe.  Your point is meaningless in context to what I was getting at. 
---
Try again :) 
---
Thank you Blizzard &amp;lt;3
---
If you have a weapon with speed 3+ it's literally only 20 more clicks per minute if you are constantly fighting. That is absolutely nothing and it can potentially halve amount of incoming damage you receive. Only one person has to kite while the other just follows the mob and hits. If they take agro then they kite.
---
Situational awareness is part of the game, pulling extra mobs really shouldn't happen. And if your in a tight spot, just face tank. The point is that for a miniscule amount of effort you can significantly bring down your down time. No one days you have to do it this way, but you can and it's an effective way of leveling. OP asked for some tips and so I gave him/her some tips. That doesn't mean that this is the end all be all of leveling strategy, because it's not. You absolutely don't have to go full heal full dps. 
---
Priest are an entirely different beast to shamans as they have wands and wands are op. They also have vastly more mana effective heals + they have way more use for spirit while leveling than an enhancement shaman does. You really can't even begin to compare the two in this setting. 
---
I had a troll priest in Vanilla. Since it was an alt I didn't have good gear.
---
I really enjoyed healing so I decided I would heal in BGs too.
---
As soon as the enemy saw you heal, it was instant focus (heals were very very rare in BGs you stood out immediately).
---
Since I was dying before I could use all my mana bar, I went to the Ah and bought max stamina gear to be more tanky.
---
I think I managed to get something like 4k HP but it was still not enough. So I was trying to be sneaky about my positioning, but once you're focused as a priest it's bye bye if you have no assist.
---
I was dreaming of being a paladin back then, just for the "fuck you bubble" ;-)
---
Since I nobody will play Classic by the end of the year anyway, they might as well delay it
---
But how will pooor little Activision show market capitalization if they don't sell those boosts? Or the barbershop? Or name changes? Oh my gawd, won't someone PUHLEEEESE think of the shareholder valuations?
---
The time it takes a warrior to level to 60, gather several expensive gear sets and prepare for raids would be enough to get two raid-viable characters.
---
Yeah then the Spriest wipe away their tears with the corpses of almost every of class in PvP. 
---
My guesses:
---
Part of the people advocating for it never went beyond nefarian anyways.
---
Another part of that pool repeats whatever they hear (Which should not be surprising)
---
Another part wants to have the whole raid fear warded by 8 dwarf priests to save up time in a fight (Where damage is lost due to DPS being feared).
---
And lastly, probably everyone was in a pug group once and they died due to fear mechanics any good guild won't have big trouble with anyways, but they don't want that to happen again.
---
You definitely should have a Fear Ward for the Tank as Alliance since we have the option and ignoring it would be kind of stupid, but the absolute insistance for more of them on this sub is borderline cancerous.
---
Here’s my 2 cent, take it or leave it. 
---
A large part of what made Vanilla raiding difficult, besides the coordination of 40 individuals with more than likely subpar computer equipment was that the genre itself was new. Most of us raiding during that time had never played an mmo before and we had nothing to base our experience on. Sure if you compare it to the complexity of some of today’s raids it may have not been as difficult, but virtually everyone I’ve seen make that argument fails to incorporate the decade plus of added expertise of players between those time frames. 
---
There’s a lot in general I prefer greatly about vanilla than current retail, with my opinion being by and large it’s just a better game. Everything it does it does better, questing, professions, social aspects, raids (they seem more like a job now), and so on. 
---
Do I think Classic raiding will be hard? No probably not, at least not to the extent that it was back then. There’s a reason guilds like Method exist now because the game seems more of a job than anything. For me it’s always going to be a game I loved that was a huge part of my childhood. Raiding with 39 friends on Friday nights because there was literally nothing to do where I grew up (seriously the highlight was hanging out in parking lots at the Walmart the next town over - hard pass) will always be a highlight of my life. I don’t like retail because it feels like a single player game set in an mmo where once LFR is established for the raid you barely need to even speak to clear the place. 
---
Haha, it was either a Raptor or a bug thing from Silithus, can't remember. I definitely do remember raiding with it though. 
---
Lol @thrall irl
---
Wow, you really know a lot about this. Thank you very much! 
---
&gt; 850 gold power supply 
---
Dude your power supply is almost as expensive as an epic mount !
---
To be fair you have to be very careful with revamping. Trying to reinvent what a large percentage of your user base enjoys otherwise they would not be subbed does not work very well as we found out with Star Wars Galaxies.
---
I remember my main was an undead warlock, and I there was this one dude, a level 45-ish human paladin, who ganked my level 36 ass while I was grinding in the shimmering flats on his way to Tanaris. Now I’d been on a power trip before he came along, having killed a number of Alliance in that session thanks to Warlocks being OP in general, so when he cut that short, and then rubbed salt in my wound by camping me for three kills, I grew curious.

I remembered that name, and wrote it down. Killing that bastard was my big motivation in life from that moment on; in fact I stepped up my level grinding a crazy amount just so next time I saw that smug fucker I’d be ready to burn his ass to the ground. It was a bigger motivation to level than any dungeon or even my mount.
---
Well, two or so weeks went by and I was now level 44. I’d been no lifing hard. So there I was, grinding away in Tanaris, when I saw him, trotting heroically past upon his golden steed. And he had been slacking; he was only level 48. I wasted no time; I hopped upon my felsteed and chased that glowing bastard down. When I caught him, I rained dots down upon him, threw shadow bolts his way while my loyal felhunter tore at him. He gave as good as he got; it was epic, a true battle of good and evil in the middle of the desert. But as time wore on, my superior Warlock DPS wore my enemy thin, and after being forced on the defensive, I won the day, watching him fall with glee. 
---
After his defeat I cannibalised his corpse, just to rub it in, and camped his body, just as he’d done to me. The next fight, I was again winning; this time, I forced a bubble hearth out of him. After /laughing at him, my desire for revenge satisfied at one kill and one minor inconvenience, I mounted up and continued on my way.
---
Perhaps that should’ve been it; but the cycle of vengeance never ends that quickly. Two hours later, I was still in Tanaris when I heard that all too familiar sound of a cheap shot hitting me. As a Night Elf rogue tore through my robes, no sooner had I broken from the cheap shot than I was hit with a hammer of justice.
---
He’d returned, and this time he brought a friend. With no hope, I was destroyed quickly, my pride broken once again. Unwilling to admit defeat, I sent out a message to the general chat; ‘Alliance killing Horde at Dunemaul ogres, someone help please!’.
---
Sure enough my call was answered; a rogue and a mage came to my side and we destroyed them once again. After that he must’ve logged because I didn’t see him again all night.
---
For the next few months, I saw my rival now and again. And each time, either I’d attack or he did. At first it was no honour; the more mobs on us, the better. At some point though, the hatred turned to mutual respect. I think that started in the Plaguelands; I was low on health when he came by me, and he actually waited for me to heal to full before attacking. From that moment on it became this unwritten rule between us; we also only ever fought 1v1, if I was with a group I’d tell them to leave him to me no matter what, and he did the same for me on a few occasions.
---
I haven’t seen him since early wrath, but I’d love to know where he is now.
---
Simple kids we were back then
---
It provides them with free mana. You implied everyone goes oom, locks don't. 🤥
---
Yeah, we’ll probably need an addon for collecting all mail items.  
---
Shit like this is how they got to retail. Go play retail.
---
Yeah new doesn't mean better, old doesn't mean better either.
---
Some games *haven't* aged well. Though I don't think Vanilla WoW is one of them. 
---
True, in the strict sense of the term. However, the point I tried to make was that short leveling is a cop out, to make early content just a timegate rather than -the- game. 
---
Back in the day I had never attained level higher than 58 and the game had to be engaging early on to keep me going. Nowadays an exuse can be made, that early game doesn't have to be fun, because the "real game" begins at max level.
---
Set max FPS to 25 and no anti aliasing for the true experience. 
---
It already does, and has. 
---
Everyone knows you go NE priest because they look cool in the armor set/lore
---
1. They probably though it would make the Shaman op. But I think you're right. Blood lust was just too iconic.
---
2. They had to come up with a lot of zones, especially in kalimdor, since the EK and and Kalimdor were only shown through a few zones back in the warcraft games.
---
5. I think Tauren shamans basically represent the Spirit Walkers.
---
8. Vanilla had no underlying theme. That's one of the reasons I like it. It's more about exploration and forging your own story. MMOs are terrible for telling stories for obvious reasons. I think WoW lore died when they tried to continue the WC3 story line. They just couldn't do it in WoW the way they did it in WC3.
---
Something that I always found an interesting idea is giving shamans different spells based on their race just like with priests. Shamans differ from race to race as each race follow different spirits/gods.
---
I think it would have been cool if Orc shamans would have gotten Blood lust, Troll shamans some voodoo spells based on the Shadow Hunter and Tauren Shamans spells akin to the Spirit Walker. Unfortunately a missed opportunity. The shaman feels a little unfinished to me compared to the other classes.
---
Ah, right. I did not make the connection between AQ and Undead unit from wc3. I wonder how it became an undead unit.
---
As a raiding enchanter with basically all the recipes (even the rare raid drops) in Vanilla - you might make a few tips here and there, but I doubt it ever covers the cost of levelling Enchanting in the first place.
---
“Some men just want to watch the world burn”
---
Because fearward is significantly easier and safer than having your tanks try to stance dance the fears.
---
Thing is, the hardcore guilds will have the tanks capable of doing it, it's the casual guilds that will get screwed without fearward
---
I don’t play on private servers so I wouldn’t actually know. 
---
Do you understand what point I was making when I said “and no one ooms” yes or no. 
---
I remember having to pull a pack or two in MC with Eyes of the Beast and doing some Freeze-Trapping. Pulling that off successfully felt good. 
---
Yeah, people say paladins have so many "oh shit" buttons. It's kind of unfair
---
Ion said there’s a july 16th percent chance of them not admitting azerite was a mistake 
---
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here
---
&gt; Cata 
---
I'm gonna take the controversial route here and say it started ramping up throughout Wrath. The growth rate for the game was pretty close to stagnating compared to BC.
---
I don't really put much faith in buffs since I play alliance. They are either going to be purged by a shaman or people are going to just die soon anyways. And I find buffing at the gy pointless, it's better for you to quickly get back to healing. Just my opinion/playstyle. 
---
I only take spirit of redemption in the first build because that spec is designed for "I just got 60 and have never even raided' pvp. I expect an ungeared priest to be spending more time dead, and thus Spirit of Redemption comes in handy.
---
But most of the points can be shuffled around to fit playstyle. 
---
This is a really good answer. 
---
Once you have that T3 you can finally get all that cash on top of the mailbox!
---
That guild doesn't get to exist for very long if that happens. 
---
Obsidian Statues / Destroyers in Wc3 were Nerubian constructs, Nerub and Qiraji are both Old God influenced species so they share some architecture and skills.
---
Pal is what you want and they are hilariously overpowered but alliance only. Shamans primary job in pvp is providing the warrior/rogue windfury and purge everything else is just a bonus. Priest is good but have to rely on your teammates to peel for you since scream only does so much and you can be a bit squishy. 
---
So basically the most expensive boe to ever exist paired with a rare boe world drop epic which also sells for a ton
---
Boomkins are actually somewhat decent.
---
These people are wild. Imagine actually caring about competitive DPS in PVE lol. 
---
What’s even crazier to me is the same people pushing this meme are the same ones that require all world buffs and full consumable use before attempting a raid that doesn’t require any of it.  The audacity to call Wrath and later expansions EZmode, but the find a way to turn Vanilla into ezmode 🤔
---
I went all out with a similar build to get 80fps+ is Escape from Tarkov, but I usually play stuff now that the build absolutely crushes.
---
You got me there
---
Oh God I remember Kharazan doing 1 button rotation, only switching to viper on long fights... All the way to SSC. Ugh
---
2. Garithos is the forgotten character of Warcraft. While he was an asshole, I think he added a lot to the TFT campaign. So it's sad nobody mentions him in game.
---
4. To be honest? I think blood elfs should have been pretty much written out of the lore for the most part after WC3 TFT. They were basically slaughtered by Arthas and the Scourge at the end of TFT. Blizzard needed a lot of lore bending to just include them into TBC. What they did then to Kael'Thas and the Blood elves lore wise in TBC was horrible. There are some Blood Elf npcs in Classic. That's enough, there don't need to be more.
---
Fair point. 
---
Yes 100% ^^
---
Unfortunately Starshards isn't a good spell. It's better to spam smite and then wand if mana is an issue. I agree that the dwarf priest master race issue is overblown, but if a guild doesn't have one dwarf priest they will really want one, and having a second is pretty good too. More dwarf priests for melee coverage is nice but is mostly minor min/maxing benefits if there are already two.
---
You're not going to have 8 priests in a raid, let alone 8 dwarf priests. Even 5 is too many depending on your raid comp.
---
You want atleast 2 dwarfs to cycle FW on your MT for Ony. But what happens if one of them can't show up to raid or leaves the guild? 
---
That's why people try to stack them as much as they can.
---
I expected nothing and I'm still disappointed. 
---
It is though. The only reason shadow priests can see some use is thanks to Shadow Weaving, a debuff that increases shadow damage done by warlocks. However, a holy priest throw some talents into shadow and proc Shadow Weaving by occasionally casting rank 1 SWP. This is better than bringing a shadow priest, since shadow priest DPS is not very good.
---
On the other hand, fury warriors have amazing DPS and there's no reason not to bring them to your raid.
---
Yes, it’s called: “/1 where’s Mankrik’s wife?”
---
JK.  Seriously, I want to figure it out myself and with the help of other players.  I loved just exploring and coming upon mobs that I had quests for. 
---
Thats why you want as many buffs as possible though. Its better that your rank1 shadow protection, divine spirit and fortitude gets purged, than having your shield and renew get purged straight away.
---
I'm lvl 58, that is just the reward. No exp to gold or anything.
---
I'll mark them but I really think you under estimate how many people will try classic, hate it, then try retail and love it. 
---
Now I am a fan of vanilla wow and really hope it is everything I want but just like every other mmo Classic probably wont kill wow. I am hoping it will show devs at blizzard how much the community misses a lot of the aspects of the old game so they can slowly start changing retail. Which they have sort of started doing.
---
As someone who got a shaman to rank 12 and likely would have been 13 before the honor system changed (eventually 14) it was not nearly as intensive as people make it out to be. Yes I grinded for hours most days, but it’s all about how effective you can be at gaining honor and at no point did I ever have to grind 18 hours a day or share an account with someone. Granted r14 is still a lot more than r12-13 but I don’t think it’s as hard as people think. 
---
It’s difficult and it should stay that way. That’s nearly the entire draw for getting any item in this game for me. If it was easy I, and likely most people, wouldn’t care as much. The weapons are very nearly the best in the game, and depending on when they come out (forget the phases) they might be BiS until Naxx. 
---
All in all keep it the same, make it hard, make people really earn it. Many of us grinding for honor worked together to accomplish our goals - I highly suggest if you are grinding r14 you work with others in your boat. 
---
Yes. 
---
because people are stuck in the early patch cycle of classic when the undead racial was 20 second fear immunity and undead rogues ruled the game. In those early designs warlocks didn't have any form of defense other than fears. See the 3 world of roguecraft videos for prime examples.
---
This changed massively throughout the patch cycle and with 1.12 talents and class balancing Will of the Forsaken is a nuisance at best with its 5 second duration. Not to mention that warlocks can (depending on build) be a f-ing nightmare for basically every class
---
Different playstyles, different opinions. You will generally have enough buffs from other people in the bg to not worry about it.
---
But once again, I said it's pretty flexible and you can move points to adjust to playstyle........ 
---
&gt;Look if you want to have shit gear it's really easy. Just wear shit gear.
---
*If you dont like flying, just dont use them.*
---
well what else should we play? modern games suck
---
3 spells, sounds like quite a bit
---
Well done! Looks very clean and detailed :)
---
Sub numbers were not reported throughout most of WOTLK. Only at the beginning and near the end.
---
Sorry, it was just hyperbole.
---
&gt; But what happens if one of them can't show up to raid or leaves the guild?
---
Then its time your MT learns to stance dance!
---
In honesty, I see your point, but it's blown out of proportion.
---
I agree on the first point there, and I see where you're coming from on the second point but I do think they could've had a good plot for the blood elves (and naga) in TBC, but they failed pretty hard. I think a lot of the lore bending came from making them a playable race, like with the Draenai except the lore bending for the Draenai was absolutely ludicrous. 
---
Very true, my smite build priest on the other hand 
---
Also, plenty of buildings that were not seen in vanilla. Arcane sanctum, workshop (maybe the depot in dun morogh is the closest), gryphon aviary, beastiary, voodoo lounge, arcane tower, ancient of lore, the list goes on and on.
---
As far as units/heroes go:
---
Mortar team present in dwarf starting zone, even came with their voice lines. 
---
There were glaive launchers littered throughout night elf zones, not sure if you meant as actually NPC units.
---
Same with orcish catapults in their zones.
---
Crypt lord in Naxxrammas. Also, I don’t think Blizzard had the model for crypt lord until Naxx, but there was a boss in Stratholme known as Anub’rhekan or something similar to that. I think it was meant to be a crypt lord.
---
Demon hunter and relevant quest line in blasted lands.
---
Also relevant blademaster questlines and orc(s)who identified as a blademaster. 
---
Brewmaster wasn’t seen, but was also referenced in a quest out of Ratchet. 
---
Also, I would consider most any goblin to be a potential tinker, although none wore the actual battle suit if that’s what you meant for that.
---
That's helpful, thanks a bunch! 
---
Prince Malcheezar is an exception because he has multiple phases where in one phase the main gimmick is he will dualwield.
---
Almost every single boss in the game has a 2.0 attack speed.
---
1 shadow in any raid is meta with 16 debuffs for shadow weaving, you wont have any trouble with finding a guild if you can play it well and farm your consumes. 
---
&gt; no races not fitting in the horde and alliance,
---
Oh look, a fucking panda is sitting at this campfire with me.
---
You said everything I meant but short and sweet:P
---
The "fantasy simplicity" is exactly what classic WoW was for me.
---
Honestly find wow to have no issues playing with 300 ping. Other tha  old school harvesting you can still be competitive on anything that isnt melee.
---
I hope you have a really good MT then
---
THIS. This is what Vanilla was about. Amazing story, my friend.
---
Yes. This is exactly me.
---
I’m looking forward to Rage 2 as a tide me over that leverages the hardware a bit. Might replay Witcher 3 as well.
---
That's good to know, thank you! 
---
Can you confirm that this is how the it works in combat?
---
&gt; If memory serves you can wait, 3.1 seconds and then cast a 2 second heal. At the 5 second mark, you get the regen and the .1 second after the cast hits and you stop regeneration again.
---
So you just need to have not casted a spell for 5 sec, not have stopped casting for 5 sec, correct?
---
But what about the horde races? Troll priests ftw
---
I agree with you. Having them as a playable race was a big mistake. I think they could have been in the game as a small neutral faction of the few last survivors who were able to flee from Northrend. The players could do quests and farm rep for them while helping them to retake QuelThalas.
---

---
That does not counter my point and is fairly inaccurate. 
---
&gt; I have to buy the base game
---
You don't anymore, battle chests are not required anymore, you just pay the sub and the whole game is unlocked except the last xpac.
---
And every time a new xpac comes out, everyone gets the previous for free, inactive accounts too.
---
Where is everyone getting the idea that sp can raid? Private servers?
---
Nah, you'll be fine.
---
yikes
---
To get to a point where you can clear MC in less than an hour, you need a pretty decent guild, consumables and a bit of gear. I don't think you will find those playing a few hours a week with a casual guild any time soon. 
---
The problem isn't with how many hours you play a week but rather how many you can pull back to back. If you could do 2 nights with 3 hours and then 1-2 days with how many hours you have left, you would definitely have a chance of decently raiding. Otherwise, no one is going to want to take anyone for just a few bosses only to have to find a replacement 40 minutes into the raid, not even casuals.
---
Is that image trying to make a point of Human spirit being good or something?
---
In full bis gear the talent will give you like 10 bonus heal and some mana regen. Going oom is a complete non issue in Vanilla after you get out of preraid gear.
---
Tremor totem and WotF
---
I've seen so many posts looking for late night west coast guilds, but I haven't seen many responses.  There is clearly more folks interested than guilds available - hope some more surface.  Given that the West Coast is a tech hub, shouldn't be surprising that so many of us "older" players on the West Coast are looking for a cool wow classic late night guild.
---
gj you googled juxtaposition. but in the future google it before you use it so you know what it means.  
---
Ease is a relative term. Whats easy for someone might be difficult for others. The more experience you have with content (or the more experienced your raid leaders are) the easier it will be. It also depends on what your raid's standards are regarding spec/gear/consumes. Higher standards typically make raids easier at the cost of more time spent out in the world farming.
---
I expect that guilds that contain a lot of people with pserver or vanilla experience will steamroll content, especially if they require raiders to meet a certain expectations.
---
Troll is the clear PvE winner, PvP is debatable if you want your meele blackout-protection or plague+wotf.
---
&gt;for a miniscule amount of effort you can significantly bring down your down time
---
Your minuscule amount compounds and starts to be very very big after an 18 hours day. And how many time do I have to tell you that a face tanking duo will have NO DOWN TIME !!!
---
Your technic might (and I insist on might) allow the shaman to do a bit more DPS which will be annihilated at the first mistake. In the end you might shave one hour on a 5 days levelling journey by jumping like idiots around mobs. 
---
&gt; Situational awareness is part of the game, pulling extra mobs really shouldn't happen. 
---
Oh excuse me Mr perfect, me I'm just a normal human that will irremediably fail at one point especially if I play 18 hours a day at launch to be among the server first players.
---
You seem to be very comfortable with your theory, put it in practice and come show me how much more efficient it is. Kite all you want, slow and steady is my way.
---
The conversation stops here for me, we'll have to agree to disagree. I don't have infinite energy for this.
---
Yep. Grab some quests from the Orgrimmar engineering trainer, complete one of the quests in Booty Bay and receive an item to teleport between there and Gnomer whenever you like. PLEASE LIKE AND SUBCRIbe
---
Shadow priest brings viable dps and keeping a pain on the boss is a shitty use of a debuff slot. I really don't see how it's practical to lose a debuff slot just so you have a healing priest instead of a dps priest. The debuff slot lost from the shadow weaving healer is a bigger DPS loss than bringing a shadow priest over a mage. 
---
Your ebin meme reaction image doesn't load properly.
---
Explain what is "inaccurate" about my claim? Blizz literally did not report sub numbers throughout most of WOTLK, hence why it appears to 'stagnate' throughout most of the expac.
---
I’m on the fence about this. I think there is to much emphasis on what people used to do and what people are doing on private servers.
---
There is going to be a much broader base of players who have experience playing an mmo. Most of them playing wow at some point. So to me there will be a lot more diverse player bases and more end game raiding guilds, so this make room for the weirder specs.
---
That all being said. 40 mans are about team work and execution. Everyone needs to do their part and carry their weight or your hurting the whole group.
---
This is why I support loot trading, their server reputation will prevent them ninjaing items.
---
You mean one v one duels and things like that? Besides like fighting a pally or a good priest you should be able to beat anyone in a long drawn out fight. 
---
I need an explanation here. It cannot be just playing red orc instead of green one right?
---
(This is all opinion)
---
Dkp works well post classic with a smaller raid size being the norm. It rewards people that show up and gearing the right people is less of an issue.
---
In vanilla, you had 40man raids where bosses only dropped a few pieces of loot. So, it benefits the guild/raid to gear certain key players first.
---
Loot council is subject to corruption though.
---
DKP  is more fair, and rewards attendance, but will slow down your teams progress.
---
Gotta trade off something for that amazing gameplay and thriving community 
---
Either way, based on t2 wrath it's not far off.
---
Being a turd orc?
---
It's just the good ol' reddit circlejerk.
---
See an opinion you dislike, report it to the sub where you know everyone disagrees with said opinion and shares your opinion istead, get free karma virtual back pats.
---
Personally think the only hard part is getting a good raid comp of 40 capable players in correct specs, gear and consumables. If you can achieve that then sorry but it really is easy.
---
No, it just makes it better for the person who's more creative.
---
Not a typo. I literally had to have surgery to remove a cyst from my tailbone the size of a golfball from sitting in my computer chair to much. We would start at 7-8 am and run to 1-3am. 5-10 min WSGs all day unless we had raids.
---
&gt;Basic gear, no a spam of new types and wacky outfits.
---
This is probably one of the things I'm looking forward to the most, both in RP and in general. It was only natural that armor designs would get flashier and flashier as time went on, but there's a certain charm to the simplicity of Classic's armor sets that a good chunk of modern armor lacks.
---
It's not uncommon in retail to walk into a tavern and see someone wear something like [this](https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ8z9q8Pdi8zmr8Pqz8zmr8Pdf8zmr8Pbr8zmr87mOig8zmr8PaZ8zmr8PqM8zmr8Pa48zmr8PaY8zmr87m) or [this](https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ8z9q8l2j8sO8l2C8sO87Ml2b8sO87ml2J8sO8l2I8sO87Ml2e8sO8l2r8sO87m). While their quality is entirely subjective, but for me there is something appealing in seeing someone RP in a tavern wearing something more like [this](https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ8z9q87oz2487Vz3M808z37Mz3m808z25808z3c87V) or [this](https://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ8z9q87Mc4v87czYM87sVvi808olt808VgI87V).
---
I dont think people who are trying classic are going to go over to retail if they hate it. Especially if they have never played WoW before. I think people will try classic and then quit all together. I get that every other mmo was supposed to be a "wow killer" but blizzard is releasing a direct competitor with their own game. And thats where I think it will kill it. I dont think retail will gain any *new* players from brand new people trying Classic. But I agree, I hope they realize how much people dislike the way retail is currently and change it. 
---
That would have been WAY better. Good call.
---
Yeah, I mean that's fair (:
---
Yes, it's a pretty simple quest, but just bringing attention to my latest quest guide video really. I hope that's not frowned upon, but I see others doing it and I'm trying to grow the channel, so I think it's okay.
---
No no, look at the flair
---
&gt; LC is theoretically the best
---
Yeah its not like LC is used in practice by the vast majority of all guilds today...
---
It will not be a museum piece.
---
There may be servers that are. But there will be updates and progression at some point years down the line.
---
yeah i don't think so. Maybe if you're a god tier hunter in an average or bad guild you could pull first, but IIRC rogues and mages are where the full damage is early, and then it shifts over time to warrior/warlock. hunter starts fine, middle of the pack, and then drops to memespec levels of DPS in AQ. By Naxx, you pretty much do the same dps as a ret or enhance in the same gear. Unlike those two specs, you have unique utility as hunter that cant be brought by a healer, which requires guilds to run at least a single hunter, usually 2-3. 
---
They were statues recovered by the scourge. Lich king sent them all to the frontline during warcraft 3 and the majority of the statues died off.
---
They literally said it’s going to be a museum piece.  The only place that what you said is true, is in your own little head.  If you want to believe that then sure you go right ahead.  Just understand you made it up and it’s not really going to happen :) 
---
Everyone get so hung up on bosses. Meanwhile there's trash with fear mechanics all over the game anywhere you look. Fearwarding tanks or even DPS on this trash will always be better than any other priest racial.
---
Two of my favorites are the Chain of the Scarlet Crusade set from SM and the Postmaster set from Undead Strat.
---
No, you will need to spend gold on respecting which will add up a lot.
---
Good one
---
That link is MMO-Champion's sub graph. There are 3 major reports throughout Wrath, with one smack in Q4 2009 along with your 2008 and 2010 reports. 
---
I love that Blizzard games make good use of SLI. Makes my dual 980Tis not feel quite as archaic. 
---
Can they tank with BIS tanking gear (which give additional armor) including blood of the mountain trinket?
---
We had one in our raiding guild, sadly he had to spend most of his raiding time as resto before he was allowed to switch. Probably cuz he needed a lot of gear to convince our RL.
---
What does the respec price cap at?
---
Hunter w/ thunderfury LOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
LOLOLOLOL
---
LEL
---
Yes, 3 major reports during WOTLK, compared to 6+ during vanilla/TBC.
---
&gt;Then its time your MT learns to stance dance!
---
Not always possible. Some fear mechanics have a shorter CD than warriors can dance. Meaning you either have to eat the fear, get fearwarded, or try to do some kind of threat swap before the fourth fear (berserker rage, deathwish, berserker rage -&gt; tank swap)
---
The indication was the Easter egg they left at blizzcon during their presentation 
---
I plan to blast the Jurassic Park theme when I first enter the crater this time around. 
---
are you really citing Tips as a reliable source of information? Link the logs and explain the data yourself or dont link at all. Tips is a goddamn clown and a lot of the data in these videos is botched. Speaking as a former CE raider in retail and a naxx clearing classic player, his ability to assess logs is pathetic. He's really not good at it and there are multiple major oversights in the videos you've linked. 
---
Maybe they just prefer playing the game the way they like. What a novel concept. If someone wants to join a guild running full consumes and buffs that’s their personal decision. I think it’s a bit unnesscarry for MC but I see the appeal of clearing MC really fast too. 
---
For what you want to do you will have to respec. The build you put forward is missing. Key element of healing and bear tanking. You want that extra bear hide for tanking. It’s a huge bonus.
---
Yes, but as a nightfall wielder.
---
Hunters are really good at keeping the debuff up due to wing clip spam
---
We're done here. You don't seem to understand.
---
Safe? No.
---
It’s not moronic if you find that it increases your enjoyment but sure it’s not for everyone. 
---
The 'data' you're using was compiled by a clown who's never played the game in any serious capacity. the fact that you trust Tips shows that you dont know what you're talking about. Hunter is very, very bad at 60 and if you level under the assumption you're gonna be hot shit in raiding, you're going to be incredibly disappointed. 
---
I recommend both. I have an ultrawide monitor for my main screen (played in borderless windowed mode) and an old 24” widescreen monitor displayed vertically to have websites/videos/etc up at the same time. It’s pretty nice!
---
MC was never hard. People were just noobs and patch 1.1 talents were godawful.
---
Nope, had to take the north flight path to Gadgetzan. Fortunately there's a bank there too.
---
The melee video you linked is from a series in which the creators are testing for the theoretical absolute maximum for every possible variable.  It's even called "BuffCapped," and it works from a place of every stupid unrealistic buff and gear piece possible being available and used.  For science.
---
The first sentence in the ranged video says *"Attempt to see realistic DPS numbers..."*
---
Kinda apples and oranges here.
---
Yes it is
---
well, you got the game down pat! But I think in cases where there is a single example in the entire game of a unit means it was not ubiquitous enough for most of us to notice.
---
Please can you give me a link to that rage video from break. I haven't been able to find it for years and started to doubt it's existence
---
If you have a healing class supporting you then you for sure want to facetank all the mobs. The extra rage means a TON of added damage.
---
"u dum xd i'm leaving"
---
Okay. :\^)
---
Anytime!
---
I don’t think so, as a weapon proc usually occurs due to a melee attack. 
---
Unless you plan on leveling in a group from 10-60, spec shadow. Its objectively the faster spec solo.
---
This is correct. If you wait 3 sec and cast a 2.1 sec heal, you will get 1 tick of spirit based mana regen. The timer restarts after completing a cast. SO if you wait 3 sec, cast a 1.5 sec heal, but cancel that heal by moving 1 second into the cast, you have waited 4 seconds and in 1 second your spirit based regen will kick in. It makes it nice so that you can precast a big heal and then cancel it half way thru and re-cast, so if you need the heal to go off don't cancel and let it land, if the tank is ok (blocking, dodging, etc) you cancel and then start precasting and let your mana keep regenning.
---
The old client was running fine with wine
---
Exactly. I'm in software so I follow the 8-5. I keep looking around and like you mentioned, I havent see a guild that quite fits as of yet. ,I was hoping a guild would guide me to pick a server.
---
You have to remember there are a LOT of people in your position! Not everyone is back in their college days with no job and no responsibilities - so finding a like minded raid group will be pretty easy.
---
I'm sure most of those things were purposeful omissions. Personally I am very glad that WoW wasn't made as a direct sequel to Warcraft 3. Vanilla does not have an underlying theme and that is what makes it so great, it feels like a world where all sorts of things are happening. I'm glad the team tried to focus more on new characters and plot points. 
---
During the announcement they said they will do what is right for the game and community. I know you desperately want your private server experience to be real but it’s not.
---
The game will be changed. Loot trading, sharding and cherry picking changes like 1.12 AV are already happening.
---
Bury your head in the sand and scream no changes all you want but there already are changes and more will come as more people play.
---
"The start of"? It was the only expansion where that existed. Hunters went through plenty of different specs in Wrath both in PVP and PVE (all 3 trees had their time to shine) and the rotation wasn't just spamming 1 button. It also changed over the course of the expansion as armor pen became viable.
---
I think you greatly underestimate the value of spirit tap. What you want to do is to cast spells, then start wanding as close to 5 seconds before the mob dies as you can. That way you get full advantage of the extra spirit from spirit tap while running to the next mob.
---
You will never ever run oom while leveling doing it this way.
---
No idea why you are getting downvotes. Shadow IS the faster spec for solo leveling.
---
ITT: Future LC council members that can't wait to steal loot from naive players under the guise of "muh performance".
---
They're very rare the only one I can think of off the top of my head, is the Epic dagger that drops from The Princess in Mara, is a rare drop level 49 epic that has a chance to proc a hundred damage shadowbolt that returns a hundred Mana. It's good for the level, but it's not as good as regular spell power weapon at level 60. (it might be better than say, witching blade) 
---
I mean he's pretty much right. The powershifting feral build is strongest early in the endgame and hunter is a trash class for endgame. Off of my raiding experience, he's right. Hunter is not a good class for raw dps, it's not a stretch to say that feral beats it at some point, especially when feral's lack of scaling doesnt kick in. By the end, Retribution does more damage than hunter, so it's really not to much of a stretch to say another 'memespec' beats hunter. Shadow priest, ret, and feral all beat hunter at various points in the game. I dont know how Shaman plays into it, I dont play horde and dont have the experience to say where they land compared hunter, but I would assume they're in a similar boat where they can beat hunter if they bust ass, towards the end of the expansion. 
---
Sorry I meant fighting in group fights what can the druid do? Druids healing and DPS are lacking so what perks do they have in those scenarios
---
All these memes make me laff
---
People call these early patches 'progressive itemization' as if there was a big masterplan behind those changes
---
I call it blizzard didn't know what they were doing as it was their first MMO with a raid that was stomped out of the ground by a team of 4 in one week - and they've adjusted MC as well as item designs once they've figured out what works and what doesn't.
---
\-
---
There was no big Plan behind the changes during those patches. They were experiments. Let's tune this, lets change that. Hey people really struggle with spell hit. Oh wait you guys said you want to make a frost resistance set for this other raid? Ok lets remove frost resistance here on this MC item then
---
I'm using 3440x1440 ultrawide and it's OMG-awesome for WoW.
---
Definitely druid, if you both want to be NE. 
---
Overbuilt so I can play Classic and OSRS at the same time, sipping on a surge.
---
What can I not do then with this spec? :)
---
And what's the optimal spec if I want to have all these roles without respeccing. Obviously I knows it's not optimal, but I look for a middle ground that works OK for all roles
---
Hahah I do NOT disagree with that.  I have both on a pserver warr, shield was cheap as hell, sword, not so much
---
“They will do what is right”
---
“THIS MEANS THEY ARE CHANGING THE GAME”
---
You’re actually fucking retarded.  
---
Actually had a 'gratz' macro on my toolbar for during levelling. We used to try and come up with the most ridiculous message to send when someone dinged
---
Just follow what jagex did w/ runescape.
---
They uphold a "2007 runescape" but they let the community vote on polls for what content is added.
---
DM East jump runs are probably the best option for a warrior/healer combo.
---
Cool.  I never leveled there so I'll definitely check it out this time around.
---
I was wondering if there was any warrior-specific reason you go there to level.
---
From what I've seen it's balancing auto shot timer with aimed and multi shot, tranq boss when necessary, occasional kiting, and the best hunters can also weave in raptor strikes with a slow enough bow
---
this is hilarious
---
Skinning: preeeetty worthless, except for the 3 day cooldown for Cured Rugged Hide used to craft a lot of the really good crafted gear through MC and BWL. So if you can't play a lot, you can still get good gold as long as you're hopping on every 3 days to make this.
---
Mining: everyone and their brother is going to need Arcanite Bars, and to make those you need Arcane Crystals, which 99% of them come from mining Rich Thorium Veins. They are highly contested but worth a lot of gold when you can get a few. You can make decent money off farming lower level Mithril Ore as well (for the people that want to be blacksmith/engineering and need ore to level up).
---
Tailoring: always good, can always flip Runecloth Bags for a small profit, as well as some of the higher level crafted stuff. Warlock and Mage have a BOP Tailoring pattern that can be graet if you're not raiding MC off the bat.
---
Herbalism: Black Lotus is the biggest money maker in WoW per farm node, you can also make a lot of good money off Dreamfoil and Mountain Silversage (used in raider consumables). This is usually best on a stealth class to sneak nodes in higher level places, but Warlock/Mage can CC/offtank mobs while looting.
---
This is the right thing to do and in a better world more people would be eating pictures of Ion Hazzikostas.
---
Nightfall is a 2h axe that has a proc in the form of a debuff on the target which increases all spell damage taken by 15%. So, as a mage or warlock, make sure to learn how to wield 2h axes!
---
Mind Flay is also a debuff, both are low prio.
---
Wow I know this means a lot to you but you need to take about 50 percent off there pal.
---
You should read the top post of all time on this sub. People want changes, people will play this game because of those changes.
---
Just because you don’t want it to be true doesn’t it mean it won’t ever happen. When the content drought happens in a couple years you will see.
---
Not maybe. It had been confirmed.
---
On that point do you consider gnomes to be fitting race in the alliance? I enjoy the lore of wow but each time there's a gnome in there he/she is usually a walking meme or a comedic relief.
---
I believe FF14 is releasing their new expansion in early July. If Blizzard wanted to steal their thunder, a Classic WoW release in late June might be an excellent way to do that. 
---
i dont give 2 shits about tips. those are actual raid damage parses. so far this is the only actual data that was presented here so as long as you dont have more to offer than raging about a random youtube noone cares about your not providing any proof for your arguments.
---
peak turbo nerd
---
Wait, I never played horde until way later when I got a free level 100 with an expansion. Does horde have better flight paths? 
---
Earthbind and Chain Lightning goes quite a long ways. You can farm plants in DM like mages, can't solo tributes like hunters can though.
---
Said before, will say again:  A hybrid system is best.  DKP with Loot Council oversight for exceptional upgrades to stop folks hoarding DKP or spending it in silly or egregiously inefficient manners.
---
Dear God, this was savage.
---
counter the actual raid data i provided with at least similiar reliable data supporting your claims or get lost. dont have more to say.
---
“Read the top post of all time”
---
Fucking Christ you’re too far gone in the circle jerk.  I’m so glad blizzard has already told us multiple times that they are making classic authentic and that’s it, otherwise I may be worried about the game because of the echo chambers that is places like this.  
---
It doesn’t matter is 1 million people upvoted a post that says they want xmog.  It’s not happening.  They told us it wasn’t happening.
---
Keep being stupid for all I care I have nothing more to say.  
---
Reads meme: Mildly amusing.
---
Reads comments: michaeljacksonpopcorn.gif
---
On a serious note; reading these comments makes me realize most people are going to be vastly unhappy with vanilla for various reasons.
---
Minmaxers think that every raid should have a perfect composition of dedicated "pure" classes and the hybrids can fuck off with their "meme specs".  They also think that they will be part of some hardcore guild that manages to field 40+spare people for every raid night and that they'll have BWL on farm within 2 months...
---
Meanwhile "casuals" (for lack of a better term, of which I likely fall into this category) will think that they will be able to raid as any spec they want, and that their shadow priest is gonna be viable for raiding 24/7.  
---
The reality for both opposing groups of players is this:  you likely wont have enough to field your own guild raid runs, for either group of players.  You'll have to pick up players either randomly or team up with other guilds.  There is going to be off specs in your raid: and the truth is it largely wont matter.  That hunter in your raid is probably watching Netflix while he auto attacks.  That warrior in your raid is rage capped because he isnt using heroic strike as often as he should or doesnt have the best rotation (despite him thinking he's gods gift to DPS for that raid).  
---
All in all people are going to enjoy the leveling experience I would imagine. But when raiding starts trickling down to the people who ding 60 after the speed runners; you are going to probably be right back where you were 15 years ago...
---
As long as the Gnome isn't a child of another player in RP:P
---
I remember two Gnomes who worked as a pair in RP as thieves/rogues sort of thing and it was great, but overall dwarves annoy me more because they get played to the exact sterotype.
---
There are quite a few addons for quest helping on pservers right now. I'm sure they will adapt them to work on the new Classic client (as all addons will have to be updated). If not, there are a lot of vanilla guides out already.
---
This is incredible. Great story! 
---
i just played vanilla wow my whole life so dont know about other expansions, but in vanilla, you dont have to plan anything at all. since you can reach everything from everywhere. atleast the most important flightspots are pretty easy to reach.
---
Remember everyone that played classic when you did is also in your situation: job, kids, wife, responsibilites, etc. So I think there will be a lot of weekend focused raiding guilds, you should fit right in, pali heals are always needed.
---
Lok Tar Ogar brother!
---
Yes blizzards word is gold and they have never let us down. Have a good day.
---
I didn't know that site existed, holy fuck.
---
I understand your thoughts completelyalthough for me when it comes to RP, I liked people that had good gear then RP gear, nice little cowboy hair with some good threads and you good to go.
---
I wish WoW did what SWG did and had your gear slot than vanity slots for the gear that actually appears on you.
---
50g you will get there fast and it will stay there.
---
mostly mad tho ;)
---
AHHHHH! That’s a war face!
---
Sure hasn’t!  Have a dumb day! 
---
10/10 would read again.
---
I have to say that using the old 1.12 WoW client with private servers, the game looked amazing at 120hz (I think was the max refresh). Running 1920x1080 at 120hz on a GTX 1070 wasn't hard and I could see where having a better graphics card would be amazing.
---
Resolution and refresh rate go a long way in Classic.
---
I didn't. I wanted to mend the rifts forming between our factions. Too many lives have been lost in this bloodshed.
---
So I thought, as I played my druid, becoming one with the cenarion circle.
---
That all changed of course when I started a rogue. 
---
Fuck the alliance, I'll rip them all limb from limb! 
---
\_\_\_\_\_  
---
(Although I'm gonna play a dwarf priest this time around, and shall fight the barbaric horde in the name of the Holy Light!)
---
Guilds functioned in ye olde days without discord; they'll function fine without it now.
---
Neither are lacking. A feral Druid in a fight can put out plenty of DPS. Heals are just as goods there is way to
---
Much mid information about druids in vanilla. 
---
What about Bloodvine set?
---
Kind've.
---
Ouch
---
Honestly, play another class. You can’t really have a half speced class and expect to be good at any of them. As a Druid you will be respecting and you will be doing it a lot. 
---
That is interesting to think about. I never liked playing melee myself but this could be a thing.
---
The hard part about these numbers are however that the server settings and stats between different videos could sway a bit. But it will be great to test.
---
I hope for SimCraft to backport once Classic is out so we can do some simming. Which I know some will hate, but its nice to know sometimes.
---
You linked Tips videos. Your data isnt worth the smegma on my dick. 
---
You're right, gonna be ok casualing through it.
---
Unless that shadow priest is hot garbage skill wise and refuses to farm money or mats for mana pots and/or demonic runes there is absolutely no reason to not take a shadow priest with a 16 debuff limit. I wouldnt take more than 1 if at all possible but 1 DEFINITELY has a place in a 40 man
---
I will say though, if they refuse to farm they're worthless. You need to chain chug mana pots when they are off cooldown to maintain your dps since shadow priests can go oom pretty easily. Not as easily as ele shammys or boomkins but still fairly easily
---
Swords is still good for pvp. Not the best spec, but still very good, esp if you are human.
---
If you do want to switch specs, try your best to go for a slow MH (sword) and fast offhand (dagger).
---
They raided during vanilla and they raid on private servers. In every raid from the random pugs full of retards to the speed kill guilds, there's always a shadowpriest in the raid. Especially in AQ and Naxx where the power of the warlock really starts to show, and ranged in general. 
---
What is your record of consecutive Saltos as a night elf
---
I asked you to link the logs and explain the data yourself. You dont seem to be able to do it. you seem to prefer strawmans. Show me the numbers. Break it down so my inferior mind can understand your grand Tipsout-watching intellect. 
---
There's always something to say when your guild has an amazing website, and never uses discord.
---
If something is archaic, but there isn't anything wrong with it, then it's considered a Classic.
---
Just throwing it out there.
---
I agree, trash is actually some of the best use of FW, particularly ZG Berserkers and the melee guys in the mindslayer packs between Twin Emps and C'thun. Either of those can rapidly wipe a raid if left uncontrolled. A trash wipe kills morale much faster than a boss wipe.
---
I've been following this legend for a long time, a great man indeed!
---
The boss in Stratholme you're thinking of was [Nerub'enkan](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Nerub%27enkan). Anub'rekhan was the first boss of the Spider Wing in Naxxramas.
---
As for the Obsidian Destroyers, I don't think there was any lore at the time of Vanilla that suggested where the Scourge got them. At some point, Chris Metzan and Alex Afrasiabi confirmed that they were the remnants of the Nerubian Empire's tol'vir slaves, but the tol'vir weren't really invented until Cata.
---
My group said "Congratulamasaurus Rex" because it was a Big Deal.
---
100% agree. Any spec with mana problems needs to farm, no exceptions. 
---
I mean they probably have a decent idea. However I'm 100% certain the reason they haven't told us a release date yet is because there could still potentially be unexpected delays. 
---
I have definitely had this dream before.
---
They dont like reality.
---
Esp if you are human?  Weapon skill doesnt exist in pvp
---
I get that, #nochanges after all! 
---
&gt;Was there is a historical basis for all the zones in vanilla? Or was a lot of it made up just for the game? Never heard any mention of Un'goro, Winterpsring, etc. in wc3
---
Winterspring appears on the loading screens in the night elf campaign. But generally you're right - the southern half of Kalimdor (roughly everything south of Mulgore) seems to have been made up between WC3 and WoW. My theory is that WC3 was developed with the original Azeroth map ([WC3 version](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/1/1c/Warcraft_III_-_Alpha_Azeroth.jpg) and [WoW version](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/b/b8/Azeroth_map_concept_Metzen_1999_wall_painting.jpg?version=41388fa09528862ce02d5b3bf88a6148)) in mind, where it was a lot smaller.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOhqsLyiZoU
---
You're for nochanges, but you want one of the biggest change WoW had seen. Why not use an unstoppable force against an immovable object why don't ya. You've got a toggle for pretty water / Classic water, and that's that.
---
Your meta is outdated. 
---
These days people just have one of the holy priests spec deep enough into shadow to pick up shadow weaving. 
---
yeah, and it is surprisingly awesome.
---
To be fair, Kiljoy used to wear a similar helmet, and I think shoulderpads were very similar as well. He wasn't GM tho.
---
Old WC without a map is fucking impossible lol
---
Every time I think I've learned my easy around I get lost again.
---
this is gold! 
---
This is it right here. Hope this gets featured on Asmon or StaySafe's stream.
---
BRD really shouldn't be run all as once unless you have 4 hours to kill lol
---
Usually you go with a group targeting a specific set of areas.
---
For PVE spriest -- Wrath of Cenarius or Rockfury bracers? 
---
Can’t fault me for their names being so similar lol. 
---
Thanks for the clarification 
---
That is BRILLIANT!!!
---
Now I know how to solo him on my hunter!!!!!
---
You need TBC for a smite priest.
---
You should give both a try to be honest. I actually leveled with daggers and didn’t find it to be that burdensome. Swords is definitely easier but it’s pretty one dimensional in pvp. You’ll definitely have more fun PVPing with daggers. 
---
Excellent fucking typo
---
Hmm, I not sure if you're serious or not. If there's a class in vanilla that actually can do both tank and heal in the same specc, pretty decently it's druid. Maybe Paladin, but they dont have a taunt and can cause trouble.
---
Would you argue this guy Skarm doesn't know what he's talking about? 
---
https://youtu.be/bG5P71m6D4g
---
And Moonkin and Leader of the Pack in the same group! :P 
---
Wow, thank you for your in depth knowledge! 
---
The reason why I've been considering skinning is because it's easy to do while leveling and pretty much free gold when vendoring. 
---
Would you recommend saving up all linen cloth, wool cloth, runecloth and so on and begin leveling tailoring when I've reached level 60 and do two gathering professions while leveling, or level tailoring while I'm leveling my char? 
---
He’s a legend 
---
The problem with armory is that it drops literally nothing but mail gear so no one but warriors ever want to do it.
---
Occasionally a Shaman or Paladin, mostly for the axe. Or a level 40 Hunter coming back for a weak slot but that's not always worth the effort.
---
Learning from your mistakes and then implementing solutions means you're a minmaxer, because the things you'll find need to fix will be "unfun".  We didn't down that boss because our warlocks are in spirit gear and our tank thought it would be more fun to play 10/20/21 spec.
---
Rough stone or?
---
hahaha...ill fix that. derp me
---
Hi
---
Wie siehts euer Bedarf an holypriests aus?
---
&gt;I was really thinking about going Shaman. That's a bit discouraging. :/
---
Shamans are great at PvP, just not fantastic at PvP in resto spec. 
---
Personally I can't wait for the great RP wars of "retail lore is canon in classic" versus "Only things released before BC are canon in classic".
---
Haha
---
Don’t know who he is. If you want to follow what this guy is doing then do it. I’m not here to tell you what to do. I am here to give you information based on my experience in vanilla wow. Not what people are doing now, not what people are doing on private servers.
---
You sound like there were seven of you or something. There where thousands and thousands of players, people said different things.
---
The point of me posting this is to show a more realistic view of raids for the average player. There is gonna be a lot of private server players in classic but there's also gonna be at least 10x more people that never played vanilla before or only played it back in the days. Bwl will be cleared the day of its released, a lot of guild will have cleared bwl on the first week, but for the average player, they will take weeks before they kill Nefarian.
---
Just take it as truth that you wouldn't want to play with a guild like that, whether or not they will exist.
---
Same, only I'm waiting for Zen 2, and am either going GTX Turing or Navi. My WoW drive will be 3D Xpoint, and I'll either have 32 or 64 GB of DRAM depending on the state of the market at that time. I mean, you can't be prepared enough for AQ's gates.
---
As a person interested in receiving handjobs, I disagree, this situation seems great for me.
---
No one said anything about being perfect and no one said that this is the only way to go but if your going to critique something you have to expect a discussion and not get bent out of shape when someone disagrees with you. Agreeing to disagree is fine, there's more than one way to skin a cat. Best of luck come release bud and thanks for sharing your opinion, that's why we're all here after all. 
---
Haha yeah I remember people coming out with all sorts of crap, funny stuff though!
---
Yeah, seriously.
---
Its a Facebook mobile game, not a proper lobby game.
---
People just use a holy priest spec'd for shadow weaving so you get the debuff w/o the dps loss
---
Hunters wont get Thunderfury so no.
---
lmfao
---
It was dense... really dense.
---
As someone who has never raided, are there any guides or class specific resources I can use to prep myself accordingly? Similar to Joanna's leveling guide where it is very informative. I'm looking for a step by step guide that describes which consumables are needed per raid per class. Then also maybe some farming routes. I enjoy learning from others in-game but if I can prepare myself by taking the initiative, I'd much prefer that.
---
Back when we wuz kidz.
---
Was extra gold rewarded at max level instead of experience implemented in classic?
---
You could use weapon switch macros to swap from mh sword to dagger and vice versa so you could open with an ambush and immediatly switch back to swords for the human +5 skill bonus.
---
I know the feeling.  
---
Vega 64, Ryzen 2600x, 3000 Mhz RAM, 1 TB NVME SSD, 144HZ freesync monitor...  
---
And I'm playing WoW Classic, Warframe, and Slay the Spire.  
---
I have some things I need to rethink all of a sudden.
---
The 60 camping low level zones is the essence of world pvp in vanilla. You will almost NEVER get a balanced and expected match up.  In vanilla that only really occurs in duels and BGs which are available on both PVE and PVP servers.  A disadvantaged opponent will almost never attack a superior force so you are either going about your business questing or grinding and get ganked when low hp, engaged with mobs, or outnumbered or out levelled, or you gank someone else.  So if getting ganked is not worth the ability to gank others to you just roll PVE.
---
Druid Rogue is always a good combo for double stealth. That way if you want to skip past anything, both of you can.
---
It's literally destiny now. Lobbies to join groups, raids and pvp, "public events" aka world quests, classes that aren't very different from each other with easily changed specs, Exotic items are legendaries from the Legion expansion, "lvling" through early content is a boring unchallenging chore, PvP and Raids are the only reason to play it.
---
Joseph the  Paladin in the Technicolor Dream Idon'tknowwtfthatoutfitisbutitlookscool.
---
So what was the basis for their existence in Warcraft 3? Sounds like they were retconned into the lore somehow.
---
Your videos are amazing man, I'm stoked to see you're going dwarf priest too! One more reason for me to go Dwarf Priest :) 
---
Maybe they were role playing vainglorious braggarts?
---
lol if you feel this way check out the subreddit for FromSoft’s newest game Sekiro. people whining and begging for an easy mode because “they bought the game and it’s too hard and deserve to experience it all”
---
Completely agree. Not only was it a fun and fairly challenging dungeon, but I loved the aesthetic and boss fights . As a warrior tank, I remember enjoying the stairway fight down the pyramid. Plus, there’s so much iconic loot that drops here that has great stats and looks awesome (Big Bad Pauldrons, Bad Mojo Mask, Embrace of the Lycan). It’s also a bit difficult to get to sometimes due to it being fairly close to Gadgetzan and a lot of low 40’s not having mounts yet. 
---
&gt;7. Too many items to count from the campaigns that would have been cool epic items in classic WoW
---
to this, I remember when I found killmaim as a random world drop on my shaman, and was really dissapointed this cool artifact from wc3 is just a weak low lvl blue.
---
The extra damage/healing you get from +5% spirit is insanely marginal.
---
Say you've got 300 spirit, which is honestly a ton. That's 15 extra spirit from the human racial. 25% of that gets converted to damage/healing from the holy talent. So...3.75 extra spell damage/healing. Not even noticeable.
---
I'd suggest checking out [barrens.chat](https://barrens.chat/). It's a pretty great website with a ton of resources, including forums.
---
Also on that site you may find most of the stuff you're asking about under the ["Guides" section](https://barrens.chat/index.php?f=7).
---
And in the Guides section, you might want to check out ["The BIG list of WoW Classic resources"](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=1091).
---
This is a great idea. It will be easy to stay together with stealth. That actually sounds like a lot of fun.
---
It shouldnt hinder your plan too much, but a lot of those quests will be gray when you complete them. If you want to do that, try to find groups for EVERY quest you do, that way the XP gets chopped further and maybe youll even get the quests done a bit faster.
---
Druids looked so good there.
---
Right, I was just curious what was missing in my talents really. Your answer was quite vague. I'm looking into this as I want to learn, not to be told no, it doesn't work. How how different must I talent to be useful as both tank and healing specc. I've read alot about the HotW specc serving both as healer and tank, even in Pvp. 
---
Dat loop do.
---
I thought it was also a thing in wotlk, if not then my bad. I remember a video of a hunter making a 1 button rotation macro and putting it on all action bar slots, and literally facerolling on his keyboard to be top dps. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y7MGWW1Xqc
---
might not be optimal like it was in TBC though, i have no idea
---
Yeah I have a decent gaming laptop and there were moments during the Classic demo on max settings where performance was noticeably slower
---
Inb4 they make a Human NPC constantly stuck in the eating animation on retail...
---
Some people are just next level dedicated.
---
I admit I'm also guilty of this. My main on retail is also my RP main, and I tend to roleplay in whatever transmog set I'm wearing at the time. Given she's a Death Knight, so it'd be weird to see her in casual clothes.
---
When Classic launches, I plan on playing a younger version of the same character, before she became a Death Knight. As such, she'll be wearing much simpler, more casual attire in taverns and on the streets.
---
CL isnt really AoE, its 3 targets. Magma Totem and Fire Nova Totem cant be used together and both arent very good.
---
It's not about "tank not good enough to stancedance", there are so many fears in game that happen faster than 30 seconds, it is literally impossible to berserker rage every single fear.
---
Not just bosses, but there are trash packs with very dangerous mobs that fear as well, like the c'thun trash.
---
That’s right. I’m not aware of the best pre-raid gear in every item slot as a mage. But maybe get the legs and feet then. 
---
I'm interested
---
Starshards has both higher DPM and DPS than Smite.
---
You're comparing numbers under two completely different sets of conditions. The first video is buffcapped and using weapons that a hunter is never going to get. The second is an attempt to demonstrate realistic dps.
---
Also your numbers aren't even right. The BiS dps from video two is 733. Not sure where you're getting 612 from.
---
I am having trouble with the talent tree calcs on my phone and I haven’t been able to to get to my pc. I am remodeling a 100 year old cottage in the mountains of California on my weekend days which leaves me with very little time. 
---
Honestly, play how you want. You will adjust and learn based on your experiences. I just don’t see the point in being a both. Bear tank in Pvp is nothing except a not die machine but your DPS will be lacking and your heals will be lacking. If your in a group you should be healing or tanking not doing both. I just don’t see the point. 
---
Full feral spec with a little bit of heals will still serve you fine in the pinch where you need to heal yourself or a team mate. If that’s what your looking for I would go mor feral.
---
I'll personally be rolling on an RP-PVE server, and here is why
---
If Classic launch is anything like how it was back in 2004, the game will launch with a crap ton of servers BUT only like 2 RP servers, the RP community normally all flock to one RP server like in retail based on faction (MG for Alliance RP and WRA for Horde RP), this reduces the chance of joining a dead server on launch GREATLY
---
Plus PVP is fun until you realize how insanely broken it was, mage polly lasted 40+ seconds in PVP in classic with no DR, same with sap, getting chain CCed until they decide to finally kill you, getting literal one shotted by things like reckoning bomb and POM Pyro randomly, there is NO denying PVP in vanilla was insanely imbalanced in every single way 
---
I know I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but I think people are blinded by nostalgia and blocked out the memories of getting chain ganked by squads of bored people, having entire zones like Redridge unplayable because of some high level camping the entire town, and 95% of the time no one wants to be bothered to come help, so you're forced to just grind mobs in other zones until they decided to leave and you can go back to questing
---
TLDR; Roll on an RP-PVE server and just chill and level peacefully if you don't have much time to play, and if you get the PVP itch you can always sign up for BGs.
---
Link for the different decks?
---
Also how hard and where did you farm the cards? I remember some dropping from high level instances. Any other way to retrieve cards or is it down to low drop rate...
---
K.
---
Yeah you're right why have the option of playing the class you want?
---
Everyone should bore themselves to death minmaxing
---
Can't wait for this. The perfect bio break!
---
I don’t believe shamans have the capability to run any worthwhile dungeon solo (not efficiently anyways). BUT shamans are the ultimate support class. Just take one friend of any class and see how much y’all can accomplish. You’ll be surprised
---
lol perfection
---
Rebuilt a few months ago... Classic is definitely THE game I want to play and stream it with.. can't wait to hear that CPU hum at 20%
---
It started out as a 6600K and 1060. Haven’t needed to OC the GPU yet and CPU is stable at 5.0ghz 🤷‍♂️. It’s definitely the next upgrade along with an M.2. You are correct, though, I would not have chosen a 550 to start with this configuration. 
---
If n is the number of poeple who should be muted and m is the number of people who will bother ignoring them, the number of ignore actions is O(n*m).  Whereas the number of GM mute actions is only O(n).  So muting is more efficient than ignoring.
---
You are right, I'm just curious to know what people think the context of a raiding SP is. Because it's very much a niche role, we're talking 1 sp per 40 man raid.
---
I just expect. Lot of people to get their hopes up when it comes to class composition in vanilla because their only experience is post BC or something...
---
For example a fury warrior is not viable pre BWL gear unless they have some very specific PvP gear like the BG exalted pieces, and even then its hard to justify it.
---
When its needed would be the best answer. Is the attempt going to be a wipe anyway? If it is, no need to Brez
---
Are we going to kill it without needing a BRez? If not, we might need it for another fight and maybe its too late for it to make much of a difference anyway.
---
Is this a farm run and do we expect to have trouble with any of the bosses? If were not expecting any trouble and a good DPS dies early, may as well Brez him and try to save some time.
---
The tough call is on progression runs, mainly because BRez gets the most benefit when its used early, but if someone dies early, it means youve already messed up the attempt a bit early on most fights. Later in the fight, a Brez where someone is only back up for 30s isnt that effective.
---
Lets be real, you aren't playing Classic because it's a "proper MMO"
---
You'll be playing it because you missed out on the opportunity to raid Vanilla content and now you can go back and wrap up your unfinished business like it makes you elite or something.
---
Ugh I hate you. Don't get me "potentially hyped"
---
"The reality for both opposing groups of players is this: you likely wont have enough to field your own guild raid runs, for either group of players. You'll have to pick up players either randomly or team up with other guilds. There is going to be off specs in your raid: and the truth is it largely wont matter. "
---
Not sure, you simply described a casual guild and called it hardcore for some reason.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
I found this on the old battle.net site:
---
&gt;Fortified statue that can regenerate the health and mana of nearby friendly units. Can research Destroyer Form. Believed to be gifts granted by Ner'zhul, the Obsidian Statues are often used as figureheads at the forefront of many Undead armies, inspiring awe and fear in the enemy ranks. Nothing can prepare the enemy for what this unfathomable statue could become. Attacks land and air units.
---
It would seem that, prior to Metzan and Afrasiabi's explanation, the obsidian destroyers were just magical constructs built by the Scourge. Why they also appeared in Ahn'Qiraj under the control of C'Thun wouldn't be very clear based on that lore. I imagine the retcon was designed to fix that confusion.
---
I tried to get the shield drop in retail for so long. I think its still expensive. But ive always wanted both. 
---
Your meta is too strict for content this outdated. Bringing a shadow instead of a holy weaver makes zero difference for clearing content.
---
If speedracing vanilla raids gives you joy, then congrats to that .2% of the player base. You can do whatever you want.
---
Herbalism will give more gold but mining is better for engineering. 
---
One of my guilds used a combination of the two. 3 metrics determined your points on a scale of 1-30. 
---
1) Raid attendance: Each hour in a raid earned you a point. If the guild raided 32 hours in one month someone that was there 29-32 hours gets a 10, someone that attended at least one raid gets a 1-2. If someone doesn’t attend any they are deemed “inactive” and eligible for vendor only. The first “raid report” was taken at start time to reward promptness. Sometimes bonus raid attendance was given out on tough or important clears. 
---
2) Time in guild: Each month of being in the guild raiding earns you a 0.5. This is to reward consistency and loyalty. If you go inactive you lose 0.5. So someone in the guild raiding 20 months caps this out. 
---
3) Time since last loot. Every 5 days or a week depending on raiding frequency you go without loot you get a point. Sometimes the stuff you need doesn’t drop or you really want a particular item. 
---
The points are one thing but the loot council is there to sort out the logic behind the numbers to factor in decisions such as size of upgrade and applicability. 
---
It’s not perfect but it served us well. 
---
As a warlock, you're extremely wrong. 
---
Winterspring:  [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/6/64/WC3-N04.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080613153135](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/6/64/WC3-N04.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080613153135) 
---
Fair point
---
You can play whatever you want, but if you're trying to join a group that wants to play optimally don't get upset when they turn your meme spec down.
---
Noone can force you to play the game in a certain way, but you also can't force others to play with you
---
His main content is some of the best IMO.
---
I'd recommend enh shaman and feral druid. It's a lot of fun.  Pally pally has some good synergy but a lot of it doesn't come until later levels.
---
Minmaxing is literally the only thing that's fun and challenging though. If you want to bore yourself to death, roll some shit spec and make it so there is no competition or competitive sport to look forward to (which is all raiding really is and what makes it fun). That way you can just casually bottom out on the meters with no accountability and no one to race against.
---
Avatar for warriors. Muradin all the way man.
---
Go Herb and Alch
---
I'm not trying to force anyone and I'm not trying to join a group that wants to min max every part of the game cause that simply isn't fun, especially since most of vanilla end game is fairly easy.
---
I'm not trying to force anyone to play with me, I'm trying to point out that Ret pallys can contribute to a raids DPS.
---
Back in the day, i quested around avoiding major cities during peak hours because it would lag so bad wow would crash or i'd get DC'd.
---
As a NE player at the time, i loved Darnassus because i could actually go there whenever unlike ironforge or stormwind which was basically a no-go zone.
---
Like buying a Ferrari for the sole purpose of driving 10 mins to work.
---
uhh, there is no reason to play the game if you don't care about competitive dps...
---
Bringing 30 people instead of 40 also makes 0 difference if everyone knows what they're doing.
---
The point is people have figured out a more optimal way to play the game, you absolutely do not have to play it that way, but saying that 1 shadowpriest is required is just plain wrong
---
But I need engi for pvp and raiding?
---
Oh, god. Has this even been brought up yet anywhere?    
---
That sort of thing is why I stay away from the WoW RP community, and just stick to my own personal storyline.
---
You can't though. It's really rough out there for ret pally. Even the lazy/slacking/watching Netflix fury war can easily out dps the tryhard ret pal
---
But if they're impossible to reach, how did you get there?!
---
What? No
---
Black Magic!
---
How much engineering will I really be able to make on my own with mining? I am planning doing both PvP and raiding so I assume I need quite a bit of stuff from engineering?
---
By the time of WoW the Horde and Alliance have proper treaties and political recognition, so its not like names and places are completely unknown to eachother. It seems like they recognize eachothers names for things. 
---
Keep in mind, the Forest Trolls were allied with the Horde, so they would know all the names the Humans had attached to things by the time of WC2, while the Horde sacked SW in WC1 and would have certainly found their maps and simply used their names for things rather than making their own maps and come up with their own names. Any names the Forest Trolls once had for areas that werent under their control for long periods of time probably werent used anymore.
---
Meanwhile in Kalimdor, everything was pretty friendly before the Horde and Legion arrived. The way the lore was written, everyone there was pretty friendly, except for smaller scale tribal wars relative to the larger scale wars depcted in WC1-3. The NEs and Taurens would have had pretty much established names for everything. The only exception being Durotar being renamed and new settlements being given proper names, which was apparently recognized at least by Theramore in The Founding of Durotar.
---
Hardcore raiding that requires you to have engineering is stupid and only brings stress
---
Beautiful. 
---
considering warlocks top meters, it's def not a wasted debuff slot for dps
---
Hey I tried asking this a few weeks ago but didnt get an answer.
---
From what I remember, PvP weekends were on a 4-week (1 month) cycle. WSG, AV, AB and then a blank week of nothing. When EotS hit, that filled in week 4.
---
I could swear I remember this, but cant be sure. Since playing Pservers for so long with a 3-week cycle (no blank), I am now unsure. Anyone remember properly?
---
No only normal mode clears in retail make you elite, duh.
---
Yes, but I forget which patch. Like 1.9 or 1.10. 
---
Legs, feet and chest. With tailoring, it's BiS till Naxx. 
---
I actually really like this initiative.
---
Making the most of this amazing chance we have : we get to experience classic launch for the second time, there won't be a third. 
---
*unless...*
---
RTX 2080 Ti here. Yep, gonna play WoW Classic for a long time...
---
Maybe battlegrounds (they were cross realm in 1.12), but nothing else will be cross realm.
---
Yeah they can, I mean doing 1 damage technically contributes. But it's really a raid slot that's just thrown away. Could give your raid an easier time by bringing a healer instead. Or speed things up with an actual DPS class.
---
Yes you can. Just remember most raids start between 7-9pm SERVER TIME. So just try to find a server where that works for you and you can make raid times.
---
Uhhh when did rogues become not good at gold farming?
---
I wouldn’t say the chest (even with set bonus) is better than Robe of the Archmage. 
---
I got an I9, 2080 ti rtx, 1tb sad, 27 inch 4k monitor with 120 hertz 
---
There should a be a guild exclusively hosting only "meme" dps builds.
---
I wouldn't call it BiS, just really convenient and easy to get items. Great for new players to make sure they are at least somewhat prepared for healing a dungeon. 
---
Yup
---
Ret is the worst meme spec DPS wise. Pally v shaman pally has more defensive cool downs and healing ability imo shaman is more offensive based and utility. As such sham does more DPS than pally on almost all occasions, however in PvP that isn’t the deciding factor 
---
No. I switch between factions during each new iteration of a private server. For classic, it's unclear which faction I'll choose this time...
---
For sure, obviously it's not required. Most things won't be required for classic raiding. The hardest thing for 90% of guilds in classic will be having regular attendance for raid.
---
How popular are hunters at 60? I'm really interested in their auto-shot timing for max dps thing in addition to their kiting/cc ability, but don't want to play one if everyone and their mother will be rolling hunter for an "easy" level 60. 
---
I won't be hardcore raiding or anything; will be sticking with semi-casual people or pugs.
---
(Warlock is also on the table, but still not sure on rolling that... plus, this isn't the "what class should I play?" thread, so I'll stay on topic.)
---
The stupid shit people do for attention. 
---
I learned to jump eternally when i first played Elder Scrolls III - Morrowind.  The game had a skill system whereby skills leveled up when u used them.  Jumping raised your acrobatics skill.  Once my friend and I learned this, jumping never stopped.
---
Enhancement shaman isn't bad! It's pretty much a ret paladin more or less, paladin can do a bit more in the sense that they can tank with consecration, you CAN 5 man tank as an enhancement shaman, it is possible, buuuuut it's painful as hell haha
---
I've played both a 60 enhancement shaman and 60 ret paladin, enhancement shaman brings a lot
---
+Totems are OP and groups love em
---
+Windfury is awesome (when it procs)
---
+You got wipe prevention via reincarnation
---
+Pretty solid AOE with chain lightning and magma totem
---
+They make awesome leveling partners with totems that taunt/heal/give back mana
---
+Wipe on a quest with your bro? Aww crap now you both have to walk ba-WAIT A SECOND YOU GOT REINCARNATION!
---
Biggest problem with shaman? Totems are a pain and mana is awful, each one takes up a bag slot, the quests are insanely long for them, they cost an ungodly amount of mana to place down, and they make you run oom very very quickly, granted you don't have to always have them down, but it helps a lot, the biggest difference I found between ret and enhance was the damage, seals procced and did MUCH more damage than things like windfury, not only that but as a paladin you can put wisdom on yourself and keep your mana going, as an enhancement shaman you can put down your mana totem but because it costs so much you BARELY get back the mana it took to place it down to begin with, so it's really to just help other people
---
But overall enhancement shaman is great, every raid group wants at least one, and if you have nightfall you're a shoe in for a raid spot
---
Also, if you're leveling with a mage you shouldn't have a problem with mana, enhance/ret partnered with a mage is an ungodly combo.
---
Newsflash stupid post is stupid

And if they have a mount or not

---
You would like TBC better.
---
Gtfo. Late August release or bust
---
In classic, yes.  See my post history when it was available in TBC and the tank asked for fear ward.
---
Tremor totems, if the healing shammy is close enough to the tank on Mag and if the run-in is perfectly timed.
---
Horde did all of those fights with no fear ward, no stacked dwarf priests.  Horde tanks were taught early how to stance dance, and did so in order to proceed through MC.  
---
But then again, maybe you weren't in MC during classic.
---
&gt; I know people are going to decry me for being a "minmaxer"
---
You know, I find that notion funny. Ony, Mag, both ZG's are basically loot pinatas the moment they are introduced.  That's already half of the encounters that have fear. And a single dwarf is sufficient to play everything super smooth there. If anything, an unlucky fear on ony might kill a good raid portion, but it stays clearable because the fight is easy.
---
That leaves trash + the other 4 encounters. That's not even 10% of the encounters you will have in PvE as dwarf, vs a constant improved dmg/heal as human. Negligible as it may be, you have a 100% uptime and improved heal/mp5/dmg at any point in the game.
---
Now, I'm not denying that dwarf is the best choice all around, but the amount of encounters where their racial actually adds anything (even trash) is extremely small, compared to 100% uptime (And I would argue theres more encounters to dps than fear as priest). Based on that, I find it absolutely laughable when you say you are "gimping yourself" by not choosing dwarf. 
---
Now, again, don't get me wrong: In direct comparison, FW absolutely is the best choice here. But the amount of encounters really gives no reason for the prevalent opinion that EVERYBODY has to play dwarf. All encounters are manageable without; All encounters are trivialized with; Every priest does work.
---
I'm a little bit late, but this guy i the absolute best IMO :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVymmQyFNVc&amp;t=489s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVymmQyFNVc&amp;t=489s) . It's from a French PServer back in Feenix times.
---
FinalFlash linked this vid to give an example of a perfect Druid vs Rogue duel in some of his vids YouTube comment section.
---
Are people still going on about fear ward. Aka carry bad tanks ward?  
---
Or are these people in the 'go team druid MT' that they desperately need fear ward
---
The chance of you puking over the keyboard because you are disgusted by your race choice is arguably higher than a raids success relying on a fear ward  
---
Then why ever bring a rogue over a warrior? They are both amazing DPS classes but warriors parse a bit higher at every stage of the game. 
---
You can find guilds that let you play what you want that value actually enjoying the game over optimising the raid comp to death, especially given how easy the majority of vanilla end game is.
---
Except for the pauldrons that go through your head every time you shrug.
---
You mean they weren't gay to begin with before the chemicals? :)
---
Release your rage!
---
I think that’s a pretty universally accepted statement. Weird to see some of these comments.
---
Man, that sounds like such an insult...
---
"Your archaic game sucks!"
---
A warlock that puts in a decent amount of effort will out DPS a Ret pally 100% of the time, but DPS players that put in no effort will get out dps'd by a Ret pally that tries hard 
---
EHP would be your true damage taken before death, this is just the armor values, basically the same thing though. EHP with 75% reduction is your hp x 4, because whoever deals damage equal to your hp has to do it 4 times total because of the 75% armor tax.
---
Why not post it to Facebook for those virtual thumbs up?
---
Anyone gotten nerdy and tried to identify every in-game venue for the scenes in this trailer? At short glance it looks like all of these scenes are just taking place in the racial starting areas, ie dwarf on the slopes of Dun Morough outside Ironforge, orc at the gates of Orgrimmar; but then I think it becomes a little less clear.
---
Many would say that the night elf is running through Teldrassil, but I actually think she's much more likely jumping down from the border of Felwood or Moonglade into Darkshore (notice the lack of any giant boughs that are so prevalent on the cliff edges of Teldrassil at the end of her scene at the cat form transformation, as well as the fact that it doesn't make much sense for her to be jumping off of Teldrassil into the ocean, whereas scouting in Felwood/Moonglade and hopping down the mountainside into Darkshore is at least a LITTLE bit more believable). I first thought the tauren was in Mulgore, but the panning topography quickly betrays that (too many bluffs/plateaus without a visible mountain range border in the distance as well as an unknown river/estuary). The undead warlock seems to be brooding in front of Agaman Mills in Tirisfal, but there may be some similar mill structures in WPL/EPL that I can't immediately name.
---
And now for what I think is the toughest one. Anyone have any good guesses at where our fireball-tossing mage is? My gut reaction was some part of Stromgarde Keep due to the cliff edge + castle structure, but I'm not actually sure if Stromgarde has any half-ruined towers. I know there are many derelict towers in Azeroth, but nothing else comes to mind off the top of my head. Any professional reddit detectives willing to confirm or challenge anything? 
---
Yep, I'm bored.
---
Thank you for writing this up 
---
I mean, the main point of the game is to have fun. I would rather have a fun guild to be in that lets things like ret/boomkin/arms etc in and be in a raid 4 hours than than everyone just trying to get in and out in a couple of hours. Also Pre-AQ, you only need like 15-20 specs this sub considers viable and the rest can be a night elf stripper squad and you can get through the raids.
---
Underrated
---
This is like...
---
"Only n00bs fly to Kargath from Undercity..."
---
In response:
---
"Bathroom break, grabbing a beer and some pretzels, brb!"
---
And if it's PVP server, you select Flame Crest (Horde) to get in the back way to BRM.
---
What about the social aspect? Finding a guild and progressing in a social and fun environment.
---
If the only reason you play is trying to get competitive DPS then classic really doesn't seem like the game for you.
---
And warriors are even better because they can spam Hamstring AND get Flurry procs for higher attack speed and even more procs. Oh and did I mention that warriors don't lose as much DPS while swinging Nightfall?
---
Definitely. Maybe I'll do it if I can't find a good fit :)
---
I mean if you're already there waiting for them at the dungeon 
---
I'm using this, macro that shit!
---
Dude! What a good story. That's so awesome man. I've been playing on a private server of TBC for the first time, after only having played in Cata and later expansions. One of the coolest things so far has definitely just being able to recognize people that you see running around
---
You're comparing a melee hunter that has every single possible damage buff in the game+fully debuffed boss to a ranged hunter that has only self buffs/debuffs on the boss. You can't compare the two.
---
Engenering is a must for PvP. And a plus for PvE.
---
Herb is the better goldmaker but you can't kill people with gold.
---
Most groups are formed gradually
---
Theres gimping yourself and then theres spreading wide public panic that if you dont play dwarf priest you never gonna get accepted.
---
Our raiding guild back then had 1 dwarf priest out of 6 main priests raiders on our rooster and nobody ever demanded we take dwarf priets only.
---
Honestly if a guild only accepts dwarf priests its a pretty good indication that its lead by major douchebags. Fearward is not a necessity for clearing raids.
---
I know Hunters are mainly brought to raids for utility and that their dps drops off the further into raid content you go.
---
But do Hunters remain desirable for every tier, and how many would be normal to bring? Do they still bring needed utility to Naxx? (I am a former TBC hardcore that never got to see old Naxx, no interest in super min-max style but I do *want* to go through all the tiers)
---
&gt; basically loot pinatas the moment they are introduced. 
---
Because there are Dwarves in the raid to fear ward the tank and nullify that extremely dangerous mechanic. (tank gets feared -&gt; drops threat for the duration of the fear -&gt; dps start dying)
---
&gt;Negligible as it may be, you have a 100% uptime and improved heal/mp5/dmg at any point in the game.
---
4 extra bonus heal is literally unnoticeable when you consider that it gets reduced even further by coefficients on spells. "MUH 100% UPTIME" means absolutely nothing when the bonus is entirely negligible.
---
This is how you vanilla.
---
What are your thoughts for PvP mate? 
---
For PvE I presume you mean the dps and stat buff totems Vs things like LoH and salvation?
---
If I have to run from Un'goro crater to Blackrock Depths, I expect that the person starting from Stormwind to arrive before me and actually help with the summons. If said lazy asshole isn't willing to move his ass to BRD, well, I'm not willing to spend a soul shard to move his lazy ass. If the situation were to be reversed and he's starting from Un'goro and I'm starting from Stormwind, sure, I'll summon him. But I'll be damned first if I'll support lazy assholes. In a nutshell, once the group is made, EVERYONE starts heading towards the instance and if a warlock and two helpers arrive before everyone else arrives, then a summon will be made for those STILL IN TRANSIT. 
---
You can also do this with Mor’Ladim in duskwood. There’s a cement barrier near the graveyard. 
---
I was always Horde and pretty active in PvP, but I never really hated the alliance. They were just enjoying the game, same as us.
---
Gnomes, though. Those little bastards were deeply despised, and I would go out of my way to kill as many of them as possible. There were a group of us that would go to Dun Morogh just to see how many low level gnomes we could kill (and to fight the high level reinforcements once they inevitably showed up). We always left the Dwarves alone, it was just the gnomes.
---
It is both plus points.
---
Total accumulated honor within a week determines places you into a point bracket.
---
E.g..
---
#1 guy (most honor earned that week) gets 12k (ish) points
---
#2 -#4 get 10k (ish) points ect
---
So if you are the top guy two weeks in a row, you have accumulated 24k points.
---
BUT you decay 10% ish of your total owned points weekly. 
---
So on week 2 you actually have : 12k + 12k*0.9 points.
---
Rank 14 takes 65k (ish) points to earn so I think 5 or 6 weeks of being a top 4 player and two weeks as #1at the end are required to hit r14
---
I don't have a problem with people saying that it's gonna be easier than it was back in the days. Bosses will be cleared on day 1 by many guilds. You're absolutely right that people didn't have experience with mmos in general and it made it way harder than it is today. Even if we were vanilla noobs, we were all MMO veterans though and we still found it hard. People are saying that it is gonna be easy as if the average player is gonna be able to clear everything without much effort and this is what frustrates me.
---
Just for more info, we took iirc 4 weeks to clear Nefarian and we were in the top 20 (iirc again) guilds on nostalrius to kill it. If you take into consideration that there were more than a 100 guilds raiding on that server, we were considered a top guild and were still struggling. 
---
I'm in Norway.
---
I don't expect anyone to change for me, so there is no need to specify that. I am frustrated that there doesn't seem to be even a single guild, at least so far that I have seen, that raids a bit earlier in the evening. It also surprises me, since I'd think lots of people had to get up at 6 in the morning, and thus would be unable to raid late. The guild raid times suggest otherwise.
---
Seriously. It's like the new norm too, and why I think MMOs are a dying breed. Find any MMOs without the hand holding you can recommend?
---
In the last 300 days I have narrowed it down from 3 classes to 6... Judging by the trend, 100 days won't be enough to pick a main.
---
I miss meeting up at crossroads and just doing world pvp events with the horde.
---
That's a really cool idea for shaman / racials and also makes me wonder.. *why priests* ? Why did they exclusively gain unique spells based off race but no other classes did? Such a cool aspect with such a narrow scope
---
&gt; Any other way to retrieve cards
---
wasn't it BoE?
---
Seems legit. Setting up my vacation days accordingly.
---
Nightfall will be a lower the dps of whoever is using it.
---
Unlike warriors, hunter's dps will fall off anyway, but you still have to bring atleast two of them for tranq shots.
---
So it makes more sense to have hunters use nightfall and let your warriors continue topping dps meters.
---
oh damn that's quite a lot
---
Thanks for the write up! So in your exp Ret did more damage than enhance? Seems both are desirable for their utility. On Ret I'm aware you can heal with just a gear change, is the same possible with enhance? (For 5 man content). You mentioned AoE from CL, would it be a part of enhance rotation? 
---
I presumed a fat WF hit more than a SoC! 
---
I'm gonna raid Fire Mage in Molten Core and NOBODY is gonna stop me. :^)
---
\#StopRacism
---
&gt; back then
---
This is 2019, not 2005. People aren't noobs anymore.
---
Lol 54 copper reward for that epic battle.
---
When he says shamans go elemental. He means that they go 30/0/21. You get plenty of healing talents while also being able to pump out some big damage numbers. 
---
Again it’s a lot about supporting with purges and totems too!
---
ima need more context
---
Norway here.
---
I did find a guild of mostly norwegians, and they seemed nice. A lot of them have kids though, and want to wait with raiding til after the children are in bed. That also means later raid times.
---
I absolutely agree. 
---
You pretty much have to plan your raid days around the fact only 35 people will show up.
---
„Exhauster“ an undead warlock that casually 1v3t in deeprun tram. He was kind of an idol. 
---
This is going to be a bit unconventional for a post like this, as I didn’t run into this player in a raid or BG. I was leveling an alt on a private server, a Tauren Hunter. I must have been around level 40, because I remember recently equipping that level 40 epic crossbow that I got on AH for like 40g. There were a ton of alliance running around, and so when I bumped into this Orc Warrior, I grouped up for a few quests. He was leveling Dual Wield Fury, which is a huge no no in Warrior meta, but his damage was good enough. Well, those Alliance came back and he charged straight at them. I was mostly just draining people’s mana. Meanwhile this Orc is literally two shorting them. He was incredible. To this day this is not something I was able to recreate. 
---
Have you just decoded soon™?
---
&gt; Because there are Dwarves in the raid to fear ward the tank and nullify that extremely dangerous mechanic
---
Oh shit, thanks for that! I wonder how we managed to do it without any dwarves. Damn. We must have been the second coming of jesus. How does anyone manage this fight without dwarves... just how!
---
&gt; 4 extra bonus heal is literally unnoticeable when you consider that it gets reduced even further by coefficients on spells. "MUH 100% UPTIME" means absolutely nothing when the bonus is entirely negligible.
---
It might amount to that one extra spell in early game when mana is a problem. It might amount to 200HP more that saved the Tank. It might add over time on the damage on every single trash pack and boss. Hell, it doesn't even matter. Statistically speaking, you are objectively better at healing and damaging. As minmaxer, you should like that and not laugh about it.
---
&gt; You may as well be claiming that Nelf priest having 2% extra dodge is good because "100% uptime!!"....no, it's pretty useless in PvE.
---
... Because dodge is not at any point affecting anything a priest does or should do. What are you on?
---
Here’s the deal with the priest/fear ward thing. 
---
Just play what YOU want. If you wanna play Nelf or Human then whatever. However, don’t be surprised (or mad) if guilds/PUGs specifically target dwarf priests. 
---
IN REALITY, people are gonna be hurting for healers so it won’t matter. 
---
All that for 353 experience and 54 copper. Gotta love vanilla.
---
Undead is leagues better in PvP, no debate
---
There's a difference between "managing to do it" and "doing it well".
---
You can do Ony with 40 shadow priests. Does that mean it's okay to do and everyone should do it? Hell no.
---
&gt;As minmaxer, you should like that and not laugh about it.
---
Take what? You're completely ignoring how utterly small +4 bonus healing is.
---
15 spirit is roughly 3 mp5, IIRC. If 3 mp5 on one person somehow saved your raid, then your raid has serious issues, far more than just having a human priest.
---
&gt;What are you on?
---
I mean... Seeing a panda at a campfire isn't any stranger than seeing a walking, talking, cow with cleavage.
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
yup came in 1.10, so will be in our version
---
"Am I joke to you?"
---
- ~Raptor Strike~
---
was 1.10 if you dont see my reply to OP
---
Why would you puke over a cute dwarf lady?
---
Imagine running out of knives when you're at like 5%
---
I remember playing Black Desert for a bit and I remember the grind to level from 57-58(or maybe it was to 59) took about a week with a good group in a good spot, undisturbed for \~10 hours a day. Not to mention you could lose EXP from dying to PvE and constant gankers that wanted you to die to PvE. People would try to CC you in mobs to mess with you. Shit was really damn hardcore. In comparison Vanilla seems more "casual" but in a good way. Cant say I'll ever do that again.
---
I'm just upset that Tauren never got to wield two handed totems as a weapon. I always wanted to smack around some Alliance with a giant log.
---
Enhance gets kited in PvP REALLY badly. You’re better off playing ele/resto.
---
Ret Pally doesn’t do enough damage to be worth playing in PvP.
---
&gt; second coming of jesus.
---
Jesus was a Night Elf priest.
---
True story, bro. :V
---
That's some fine [cheese](https://classicdb.ch/?item=422)
---
Sure, until you realize that the "hunters swing Nightfall" meme isn't done by anyone except the hunters that don't want to do anything but spam 1 button for the entire raid. It isn't done by the semi-hardcore or hardcore guilds, or even the people clearing Naxxramas in less than 90 minutes.
---
Imagine how your warriors would look at you if you told them that they had to sit in ranged and shoot a bow at stuff for the entire raid because it helps out the raid more.
---
You'll have a hard time forcing hunters to use Nightfall. There's a reason why nobody uses hunters to swing it.
---
&gt; but you still have to bring atleast two of them for tranq shots.
---
Only true for MC and BWL. You only need 1 tranq for huhu because her enrage is on a longer timer and you don't even need tranq shots for Gluth.
---
Go for GSync, 1440p, and 144hz first. If you can afford that no problem then bring ultra wide into the equation.
---
You get less xp for quests you do in a group? That would be nice, because I will play with a friend. :)
---
Is leveling a warrior easier/faster as dps or as prot?
---
And improved wf totems shaman!
---
Depends what you mean by better/worse.
---
In PvP, ret is a great spec if setup in Hybrid gear. Theres good gear in terms of the PvP set and raid gear.
---
Enhance is pretty bad in PvP despite what some people say, the main issue being that theres no itemization for Enhance Shaman, most of the gear available is Agi gear, with AP/Str gear being very rare. Youre generally at a disadvantage in most fights and hoping for good WF procs. 
---
For PvE, ill start by saying dont try either. Theyre both terrible. Nightfall is slightly more viable for Shaman because you get an extra totem group, while Allys already run enough Paladins for buffs that they dont need another, despite proponents arguing that the extra buff helps, there shouldnt be an extra buff because it should already be covered, thus a ret Paladin offers no extra utility like a Shaman does.
---
As for the Nightfall debate, if youre a Nightfall user, you wont really be doing DPS per se. Youre stuck with an OK Axe in MC and BWL and then starts to severely fall behind in AQ40 and Naxx. Theres really no reason to give one to a Paladin and very little to give one to a Shaman (extra totems). Youre much better off with an OT with it. Finally, some very simple math, you usually have about 10-12 casters in raid, lets say 12. 15% damage, would be 180% damage across all of them. Wow! thats almost 2 people, but thats for 100% uptime, which it wont be, especially not for a Shaman. Itll be up, generously, 20% of the time, which brings the increased damage up to 36% increased overall. This doesnt even include the large number of fights where melee have to run in and out, switch targets, or attack a different target than the casters. You might think 36% is still pretty good, but the Shamans DPS still has to compensate for the spot hes taking up in raid and that might be barely doable in MC, but again, his gear is going to start falling behind VERY quickly.
---
As for just straight DPS, without NF, Paladin beats them but thats not an accolade to really hang your hat on. Youll certainly be doing more than the tanks and your gear scales reasonably well through progression while getting a little help from Exorcism in Naxx, but still, you offer basically no utility, so theres no real reason to take you. Enhance Shaman DPS is similar to start off with, but then falls off severely due to a lack of gear from any of the raids.
---
Yeah I thought so. Usually seen in the AH for a few hundred golds depending on the card
---
You feel normal.
---
I think that you're just talking out of your ass to be honest.
---
 I played vanilla and swg, in fact those are the only mmos I've really played. I enjoyed both in their own ways. Swg was pretty neat because while there were no PVP zones and you can only attack people who flagged to themselves (aka pve servers). I feel like there was more role playing or even role playing without it realizing it was role playing. Just more in Universe stuff, maybe the sandbox aspect of the game caused that. Playing wow on a PVP server as the hardcore teenager me wanted to, that brought a new element of fun, but in retrospect I don't really feel like I was part of the world like I was in swg, and I think much of that is based on how players interact with each other. That's why this time I'm hoping to feel more immersed in azeroth by playing on an RP PVP server, since I feel that's close to what swg was. I want to play with people who actually enjoy being immersed in the universe sometimes, and with respect to PvP servers, aren't just about the gameplay.
---
This is shockingly well researched however it is absolutely excellent content for this sub reddit. 
---
I fully intend on rolling a horde tank come classic, however as a former alliance healer this is awesome 
---
You can get both. If the farm for 1 item you want is worth it I don't know why another farm would not be worth it.  
---
Though it's questionable how good wrath of cenarius is. Exalted AQ ring is probably better, and eye of c'thun quest reward is definitely better.
---
&gt; Take what? You're completely ignoring how utterly small +4 bonus healing is.
---
I'm not. But it IS an improvement. An improvement you don't have to do anything for and enhances every single point of your gameplay at every single time. Compared to something that's not used for at least 90% of the content.
---
&gt; But it's 100% uptime, so it must be good, right? Just applying your logic.
---
If you can't comprehend the difference between improving something your role is used for, and something that doesn't even play ANY possible role in ANY possible situation, I can't help you.
---
&gt; There's a difference between "managing to do it" and "doing it well".
---
Indeed. Hence I admit that FW is the best choice here. I'm not sure what you are even arguing here for. If you want the best outcomes, you overall are better to use dwarf priests. But you don't need to run around, forcing everyone who asks into dwarf priest roles. Because everyone can pull their weight, and the amount of encounters where dwarf matters makes it ridiculous to suggest to everyone to play something they might not want to play.
---
&gt; don't want to do anything but spam 1 button for the entire raid. 
---
*Cries in mage/lock*
---
I'm a big fan of Winterspring.
---
It's beautiful, and has some solid grind spots and later level quests.
---
It's usually peaceful but occasionally can turn into a frozen hellscape.
---
1024x768 screenshot or it didn't happen!
---
To be fair they probably have a date in mind and this could be the date. The fact they havent announced that yet gives them room to change that so they dont have to rush. I'd hope they dont announce any date till after they have had an open beta test.
---
In my vanilla guild we had dkp but you didnt just get it from being in the raid. So as an alternate being ontime and available gave points so did helping farm consumables for our raid team. So when I did get to go in the raids I ended up having enough dkp for pretty awesome upgrades for myself.
---
Syggelekugle!  
---
Found the tryhard, you know in order for a healer to take shadow weaving it requieres 20 talents points into shadow, crippling your healing a lot, not allowing you to take divine spirit/inner focus or spiritual guidance/spiritual healing, a shadow priest isn’t a top dps, but also is not useless, raided as a shadow priest and i usually was top 10, I had to use more comsumes that others, yes , but I did decent dps 
---
Nah, it ain't bro.
---
Just like 2% dodge is an improvement, an improvement that you don't have to do anything for and enhances every single point of your gameplay at every single time.
---
:\^)
---
There's no point in continuing this discussion, your mind is set in stone. Have fun wiping on Onyxia after the tank gets feared and the boss 1shots you.
---
I remember being shocked by how big the basement of Jaedenar is in there. It's basically a dungeon all it's own. Great area. For my take, I like Desolace. It gets a bad wrap because it's ugly, but there's a lot going on there. Kodo graveyard, 2 centaur camps, Maraudon, the orc fortress, a demon area, and a sleepy little seaside troll village.
---
I think I actually prefer not losing XP but losing items on death or a mixture of the two. I used to play this korean grindfest called Lineage 2 back in the day, at high level 1 death meant a day worth of progress lost. On top of that, when you die you have a chance to drop 1 of your equipped items on the ground. Now, everyone can attack everyone but if you flat out PK people (aka, they dont hit back and flag themselves) you go into negative karma and can drop multiple items on death.
---
My favorite system was probably in Ultima Online. You didn't really lose XP (well, there was no 'level' but rather a bunch of skills, kinda like RS) but all of your items remain on your corpse and you need to run back and grab them all.. before someone else does. Add in PvP everywhere and anywhere and it's a grand fucking time.
---
Yup, that's what I plan to do.
---
I say I'll use my old character for Classic, but I'm just recreating my retail main instead of using it.
---
Ah, you've encountered the classic Blizzard flight path routine algorithm. Here is how it's done.
---
1. Print out a large map of Azeroth.
---
2. Place a dab of peanut butter on each flight point accessible to a specified faction.
---
3. Take a mouse and dip its paws in black ink.
---
4. Let loose mouse on map until it's encountered every flight point.
---
5. Slightly clean up the determined paths.
---
And of course, after having mapped everything for one faction, do it again for the other faction.
---
I raided as arms on semi hcore pserver guild so you would be suprised what you can get away with provided you do stuff for the guild and show up on time prepared Etc. Getting 40 people together consistantly and in  VOIP is harder then you think!
---
Planning to do a roll system with two rules
---
BIS priority
---
Tank priority
---
E.g. (Early progression)
---
Magmadar drops
---
Tier piece
---
Random epic
---
Strikers Mark 
---
How it works:
---
Tier piece is rolled on by those that want it within that class.
---
Random epic rolled on by anyone
---
Strikers Mark is rolled by fury warriors only as it is BIS
---
Yeah, this is a pretty outrageous statement... there are plenty of reasons to play Classic without wanting to be top at the DPS meters
---
Hunters are fairly unpopular at 60. Largely because they do less raid DPS compared to other classes, a really stupid reason i always thought (HPriests do 0 DPS in raids but people still roll them). Generally hunters are medium-high demand. This is on pservers anyway.
---
Back in retail Hunters were pretty popular for RP but a lot of them didnt make it to 60.
---
My main has been a hunter in every expac, but in BC during SSC/TK I switched to Shaman for endgame raiding which was an infinitely more fun class (both resto and enhance). 
---
The one button macro was so boring I had to swap classed mid expac (and then went back to hunter for WotLK)
---
Nope, [here's why they didn't use the eagles.](https://imgur.com/gallery/Xw92bte)
---
So a system that works untill someone says it doesn't?
---
Yikes. That will make people even more unhappy 
---
2 are needed for tranqs. 3 is what most guilds have in case 1 doesnt show up. Yes theyre still needed into Naxx
---
For me stonestalon mountains and azsuna were the zones i never leveled in as horde  because i didn't like the zones scenery. 
---
What does it mean?
---
I hope for June 1 but my gut says August 31 :(
---
They still had to spend time, time *you're* not spending to farm those shards.
---
So please explain:  why they are waiting on you, and why your time is more important than their time.  Farming shards takes time, and you're wasting a shard that could be used for their damage spells / soul stones, etc.
---
So please explain why you're more important.
---
&gt; Finding out that my cousin was a horde made me physically irate with her; why would she choose to be such a bastard?!
---
Best line.
---
&gt; ridiculous to suggest to everyone to play something they might not want to play.
---
You can play whatever you want to play, but if a group is looking for X, don't get upset if they refuse you for being Y.
---
The way I avoided carrying two different sets for DPSing and healing was by getting "Of the Gorilla (Strength and Int)" gear for ret paladin, and "Of the Falcon" (Agility and Int)" gear for enhancement shaman, your health is rather low due to lack of stam on the gear, but if you're leveling with someone it shouldn't matter, this way you use the same gear set for DPSing and healing, it's awesome
---
And yeah I found myself doing much more damage as a ret paladin, mainly due to consecration and Seal of Command procced a lot more than windfury, I'd go 2-3 mobs at a time without ever seeing a windfury proc :\ RNG is RNG I guess.
---
I feel like the other DPS’s are off... the mage is just pinching the knife from the bottom and pulling it down - barely doing more than Ret Pala...
---
Seconded. 
---
Long CD and high mana cost make plague lgreat for dueling, but in a BG it can be cleaned easily and you spent 15-20% of your mana bar on that spell.
---
WotF is strictly better than zerking in most cases, but don’t write off the chance to defensively proc blackout or the mini mortal strike of troll.
---
I think UD edge out trolls since fear is such a debilitating CC, but saying there’s no debate is a stretch.
---
Can we talk about horde priests?
---
What’s the best one? I hear Troll is better than Undead, but I’d like to roll undead unless troll is head and shoulders better 
---
In the highly unrealistic buff capped series your hunter is doing just under 1k dps. Cool! Too bad in the same series the fury Warrior is doing over 2k dos *without* WF totem. (Also note: they ended that fight early because the hunter was completely OOM in just 1 minute, from that point his dos would have fell off completely.
---
Alternatively in the much more realistic video series where you are doing 733 dps ranged, you are comparing well to both rogues and warriors who were doing just under 800 dps.
---
So your choices are doing under 50% damage for 1 minute and going OOM, or doing over 90% sustainably.
---
Don't get me wrong, Caen and Grim got me super hyped back in the day. Not sure how many hours I spent watching them. But Grim was a great example of a rogue that wasn't really good compared to some of the other rogues out there, but had an entire tier of gear better than everyone else he fought, so he got carried a lot by stats.
---
For example, compare Grim's first few fights (past the 1 shot clip montage) to someone like [Perplexity's 3rd Vid here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40xcyujsfzM) and the difference in skill is night and day.
---
That preskin BF helm does bring back memories though.
---
90% of Palsins right there :p
---
I dont think thats true, that just makes you rational and logical.
---
Minmaxing requires a certain level of premeditation in my opinion.  Like people already planning dwarf priest, already planning their spec.  Mapping out questlines and zones to level in.
---
Just because someone learned that fire is hot and it will burn, doesnt make someone a minmaxer.  
---
Thanks for the response. PvP wise I found Ret to be pretty fun and hits hard enough from experience :) Kiting on shaman feels rough! How is ele performing? 
---
There's no need to level as prot. You can tank efficiently as either arms/fury in dungeons. Whether you level as 2h fury or arms up until 40 when you can get Mortal Strike is up to personal preference.
---
Alliance eller Horde?
---
I have played on private servers and I've never seen anyone with the attitude that you mention. Even me, a veteran, don't know or have not explored the whole world and still ask questions. People are friendly and helpful. There is the occasional dbag who says: google it!  But i think they are just trying to be funny. 
---
Vanilla makes you socialize with people and the unwritten rule is: be nice to others so that they are nice to you when you need help.
---
Thanks for the response my dude! Really appreciate it
---
The hunters I played with in 5-man groups were pretty well skilled.  Back then (and even on some p-servers for classic), you can trap, FD and double-trap -- meaning that you're great at defense should extra mobs appear.  
---
Knowing your gear / rotation also can bring better DPS.
---
And in Naxx, not only are you needed for the tranq, you're needed for the kiting involved with several of the bosses.  Think of your training in UBRS if the strategy is to kite.
---
That being said, one of the main reasons hunters are used in raids is the simple fact that they barely need heals if they are played smartly.  Other than curse damage that they can't remove continually, a simple renew on a hunter during a raid, their capability to bandage and stay back out of the damage effects sometimes makes their DPS more valuable.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Tools/Designer/?s=271 check a database for itemIDs and add them that way.
---
Deadwind pass. For exploration purposes of course, not leveling.
---
How there is no spellbreaker class is beyond me. That would be such a cool as fuck archetype to have and it suits the lore of a race so well, their capital is literally littered with them in-game. It's the only fighting-mage archetype that has a precedent in Warcraft IIRC and I think it was a great loss to not explore it. Perhaps just as a mage spec.
---
&gt; Just like 2% dodge is an improvement :^)
---
Yes, I can see how you are staying in the back and not healing, damaging or wanding for mp5 and instead pulling dragon whelps to show everyone your cool dodge in the raid scenario...
---
&gt; your mind is set in stone
---
I definitely know now that you have no idea what you are even arguing with me about, and that is fine. Makes it more easy for me to accept the wasted time.
---
&gt; Have fun wiping on Onyxia after the tank gets feared and the boss 1shots you and firebreaths the raid.
---
It is funny how you are talking to me like you know better and how I will wipe, after I have cleared that shit countless times without dwarves on alliance / on horde. Like, dude, I'm telling you it's not hard. Ony is a entry level loot pinata. And you are telling me my mind is set in stone and how I'm going to wipe, when I tell you how me managed easily. Are you delusional?
---
But yes, we are finished. Have a good one :^) :^)
---
I enjoyed feralas, just the scenery, swimming to that island to farm chimera.  The green Dragon spawn zone.   
---
It almost felt peaceful lol.
---
Perplexity is all about abusing weird items and engineering. Grim dont use shit like thaT
---
Yea that's not optimal, even in T7. That's also a /castsequence macro which lasts 10 seconds and has at least 8 seconds of immobility. So it wouldn't work on basically any boss except Patchwerk.
---
The TBC macro is about as long as your shot timer and can be restarted at any time.
---
The quality is shit but it says 4.7k DPS. Given that, he's only standing out because the rest of the raid is just bad. Hunters are fine in Naxx gear, but they aren't supposed to be topping the meters.
---
I don't believe he should have even been playing MM, in 3.0. The talent changes make it optimal on private servers right from the go, but on retail the weapon damage wasn't there to outweigh the unnerfed other trees. Especially original Survival.
---
Whereas in TBC there's no point where there's even a discussion on any of this, you just go BM and use the macro appropriate for your shot timer.
---
Wrath Hunter is not the most interactive class in the history of MMOs, I'm not disputing that. But it's a far cry from TBC, the class improved a lot. Disengage alone increases your skillcap massively on any fight with movement (not Patchwerk).
---
Also ITT: Baddie DKP players that want to show up and underperform, so they can hoard points letting upgrades go to waste so they can take CTS despite doing the worst DPS of all the melee.
---
Leveling from 1-60 wasn’t a great experience either, it was quite literally hell on earth, and it wasn’t about being hardcore(lol!) it was just incredibly grindy, it was tedious, the worse experience I had was organizing a group for an instance, and then after forging most of it, one guy kicked me and invited some of his guild mates, I spent two hours making that group.
---
If you’re serious about progression, you can’t stray from anything off meta, you spent your time leveling a ref pally, well now you’re a healer!
---
These were huge problems back in the day, that people wanted to have changed, I shit you not, in another thread someone is asking them to revamp the itemization to fix what were problems in vanilla WoW. You’re all excited for the nostalgia but once the reality kicks in, it’s just going to be another generation of people complaining.
---
&gt; but if a group is looking for X, don't get upset if they refuse you for being Y.
---
Well, glad I am not saying I am upset about not being taken because I'm not a dwarf then...?
---
Horde player here, when I tried vanilla as a paladin, it took me some time to understand I was doing shit :s  
---
In TBC (only time I had paladins buffing me) it was working for range attack right?  
---
Moonglade for sure

I don't know about race diversity, take a look at Rinkeby how that turned out.
---
Early greens sell for a pittance in comparison. Great magic wands vendor for almost half a gold. 
---
Dust is easy to obtain via disenchanting. It's also cheap on the AH (but won't be at launch on a fresh server for a little while)
---
Alliance
---
It is tho.
---
The problem I've seen through raiding on private servers for 3 years is that, as you say, there's usually room for only one shadow priest in a raid. This means that if you have more than one SP in the guild, they will have to compete for spots. On the other hand, if you only have one SP, you might risk having no SP in the raid which is a serious nerf to your warlocks. Therefore a dedicated and no-life SP will be very highly valued by a guild. Anything but that and he probably won't get in. It is not impossible to heal as a SP though, so you can bring more than one, it is a hassle though. 
---
In my guild we have the priest officer going shadow and he pretty much has 100% attendance over those 3 years so that's nice.
---
I believe the original intent was for all classes to have “hero class” abilities later on that were based on race and class so you could become a dwarf mountain king or orc blademaster or whatever, but it was too much work, and ended up with most such skills being dropped or made baseline. For some reason priests are the only vestige of this with their race specific abilities. So it wasn’t really planned from the beginning for only priests to have race specific abilities, they are just the only class that got to keep them for some reason.
---
Well an older 4790K, it's delidded and overclocked though, so should just about manage Classic along with my 1080ti ;) 
---
Classic does make it really hard for me to justify upgrading to Zen 2 though, as it will be all I play for the next few years. 
---
Feralas.... It's a creepy weird place but with some nice quests.
---
I have never leveled a shaman over 20. Why? Don't know, i just can't like them. On the other hand, i love paladins.
---
That's probably the best way of running things... The most active players (officers) take up the niche roles
---
Depends. Lol sorry. Do you want to save time, or money?
---
Skinning is a nice compliment to tailoring, because you need a little bit of leather for patterns. So it is saving you money on having to buy leather from other players. That's about it. There are some one offs, like skinning Defias Raptors in WC to sell the scales for the LWs making belts, black dragon scales, etc etc, but in general it is very much the lowest generating gathering type profession.
---
Herbalism and mining will be in super high demand off the bat, but also nodes are "contested" in the fact that anyone can see them on the map and come up to them. Skinning is normally the mob you just killed and doesn't show up tracking on the map, so you can get all your own stuff, plus other skinnable mobs other non-skinners kill. But you're not getting a high value off them, they're just much more consistent. You'll need bag space for all that leather and hides.
---
Leveling tailoring starting at level 1 is prob the best idea. Making yourself bags is REALLY nice. Crafting upgrades is really nice (remember gear in classic is MUUUUUUUUUCH harder to come by than you remember - you'll get some cloth +str/+spirit gloves from a quest at level 30). 
---
I'm a fan of saving time and being self sufficient (what if all the people making bags are selling for way too high a price on the AH?), because with that time saved if I need gold I can farm it faster at level 60 than while leveling. 
---
Whatever you do, don't level Herb/Mining, cuz you can only track 1 type of resource on the map. I don't think you can go "wrong" by Tailoring/X or Skinning/X off the bat.
---
I agree! Winterspring was a zone I remember longing to get to. I love snowy areas and here was a whole zone I got to explore covered in snow 
---
If you like Undead more, just go undead. They just don't have the zerking of trolls. If you want to argue, you can WotF out of fears at critical times in raiding which is nice.
---
Noone will say no to undead priests. Hell, most players are undead anyways because they like the aesthetic more (And e.g. I loved the female casting animations).
---
Not for the quest turn ins, but for the mobs you kill yes.
---
So you are comparing an OG Vanilla player, with someone who started playing on private servers like 5 years ago ?
---
Tauren is in Thousand Needles, although there are far fewer buttes than in-game.
---
It is by far, very very far, the most popular option. Something like 50:1 LC:DKP guilds ratio in my experience, if not more.
---
If you find his videos entertaining then that's awesome. I just don't think he will stand out compared to any other rogue in the top 25% of gear levels. Maybe he's learned a lot and will prove me wrong!
---
''It's here to stay'' - Used to defend the status quo
---
''Times are changing'' - Used to advocate change
---
''Archaic'' is just another useless buzzword that add nothing to the discussion. If buzzwords is the depth of the argument, then they have conceded the argument. This poor person could not come up with a single argument against classic wow, so he resorted to a buzzword.
---
It's not that you can't function without them, it's just that there's no reason not to use discord over something like a web page.
---
What kind of frustrates me is people seem to be on one extreme or the other. If you had cleared Nef 4 weeks after BWL was released in vanilla you would have been a world first by months. It’s simply not going to be the same anymore for a multitude of reasons. 
---
I don’t want my post to come across that it’s going to be easy, it’s not. But I don’t believe many (if any) of the ones who pretend it will be insanely difficult actually raided in Vanilla. Was it tough then? Absolutely. Will it be tough now? Probably, but not nearly as much as it was then. 
---
I feel personally attacked right now
---
Yep! AOC AGON AG353UCG  is what am getting, due in June/July. 200hz HDR1000 34 inch VA &lt;3 
---
Strikers mark is bis for rogues too though?
---
i could be wrong but ther shouldnt be any rays to trace in wow :D
---
At some point it was converted from a strength bonus to an attack power bonus, IIRC, which made it useful to physical DPS which didn't use strength. I cant remember if this was BC or in WotLK though.
---
Do that plan to balances the classes as the server progresses? 
---
What I really like about it is that it has the quantitative aspect of DKP but with the much broader 'effort' points. I like that it can also act as a framework to quantify non-raid effort that helps the guild but unfortunately I don't have enough friends to have ever tried making a guild that works like that.
---
\*Buffs hunter with thorns, ignores pet\*
---
I have 2 lvl 60 characters on vanilla private servers in last 2 years and a bunch of alts, Plus many 70s on x1 TBC servers. I know what I am into. And yeah, I agree that what they did with class balancing in TBC is much better and hyped mainly for vanilla because the next move may be a TBC classic.
---
BTW, lvling in vanilla is a great experience IMO. It takes long enough to feel like an important part of the game instead of useless chore preventing you from playing the real game and it's as hard as you dive into. You can be extremely cautious, never go to caves without a group, always make sure to pull only 1 mob and eat after every new one, grind the hell out of dungeons to overgear the content. Or you can expose yourself to dangerous situations, where things like situational awareness, well-timed CC and preplanning may prevent you from obvious death. It's as hard as you let it be.

I’m looking to buy a new laptop for mainly this. Anyone have a recommendation for something in the sub 600 that holds up? Maybe an Asus? 
---
Did you make this? 
---
Shieeeeet.
---
indeed, you are right. 
---
Except, the inverse is also true. There's no reason to use discord when you already have a perfectly functioning, well-thought out guild website.
---
Out of curiosity, what pet made you want to go there?
---
Also not even to mention that fear ward CAN ALSO BE USED ON OTHER PEOPLE THAN THE TANK. 
---
100% uptime on fear wards on rogues is a massive dps increase(and fears can kill you, fx if you get feared infront of nef) and with pre fear warding and all priests being dwarfs that's fairly possible. 
---
Unless you have horrible internet, the lag should really not be that bad. People play on European-based private servers from the west coast of USA and still get only 100-150ms latency which is perfectly fine.
---
You could probably play on US-West servers and be fine.
---
You outlined funneling gear to a core group first, which is usually what happens in a corrupt LC scenario, so I'm curious why you actually find corruption to be an issue? If the goal is maximum loot utilization I would think an optimal case would look a lot like a case of corrupt LC.
---
I think what a lot of people who run LCs miss is that loot acts as a strong motivational tool so in my experience, being very "scientific" about it and trying to distribute loot only with a mind towards effenciency is going to lead to poor raider retention outside the core. As we all know you need a lot of non-core raiders to make a 40man happen so there's value in giving them loot on occasion to inspire hope among the plebians, in a sense.

What’s the rough cost for something along these lines, minus the monitor?
---
It’s not that defining, both trolls and ud are very similar in pvp, trolls have a racial that gives them 10% casting speed, which is fine, and Ud have wotf that is useful in some bosses (no fear ward in horde lol), in pvp ud is the clear winner, plague and wotf are too good to pass 
---
The 100% uptime on fearward for rogues is amazing. Each fear is 8? seconds, with a dps of 500 that's literally doing 4k damage each time you press fear ward.
---
1300
---
Oh yeah, I remember those countless tales of really being into pulling one mob at a time. Other than some kind of fringe movement on reddit, no sane person actually looks back and thinks, yes that was an amazing time.
---
Osconty also has ilevel 11, which suggests 11 months delay, and has no honor, which suggests the current state of Activision
---
I *think* I remember a Solitaire addon in Vanilla, but that was the only addon that was a game that I recall. I distinctly remember us always wanting a DotA Allstars as an addon (basically a windowed mode of WC3:TFT) since my guild played that obsessively back in Vanilla.
---
I'm, actually, kind of surprised they haven't made Warcraft VR. (Would have been cooler than Diablo Immortal. XD)  They may just be waiting for better hardware/adoption.
---
I am aware.
---
Peggle was wrath of the lich king. We used to play that during Kel'Thuzad phase 1 because it was so boring.
---
Yeah and they are also (usually) the most willing to play a class spec that is not very competitive on the meters. It also helps with avoiding officers going rogue in loot council guilds. 
---
If you're ok with it, then what's the point of this entire thread?
---
If you don't want to play dwarf, then don't, noone is forcing anyone to di anything.
---
That's just kinda how the game is though?
---
Ret paladins do pretty poor dps, to the point where you have to be using lots of consumables to even compete with other classes that aren't using consumables.
---
It doesn't make sense to me for someone who's willing to put enough work in to clear naxx, to run with a guild that may never even clear AQ, just because they want to be a snowflake and play a bad spec. If that sounds like a good time to you, go right ahead, it just isn't something that I can relate to.
---
I love all of this comment. First, thanks for reminding me the name of Jaedenar. Yeah, when I first wandered in there I thought it was gonna be an average cave. It was anything but!
---
Second, good call on Desolace, I really liked it, especially with the warring cantaur tribes. Plus, you've got fookin REXXAR just wandering around being a badass! That's awesome. 
---
That's a good choice. It's spooky as hell, and just kind of standing there... ominously!
---
Lay off the pot-flavoured Doritos, man.
---
Good call my druid brother!
---
PvP is debatable. To quote someone else in another post in this thread: 
---
&gt; Long CD and high mana cost make plague lgreat for dueling, but in a BG it can be cleaned easily and you spent 15-20% of your mana bar on that spell.
---
&gt; WotF is strictly better than zerking in most cases, but don’t write off the chance to defensively proc blackout or the mini mortal strike of troll.
---
&gt; I think UD edge out trolls since fear is such a debilitating CC, but saying there’s no debate is a stretch.
---
I thought in vanilla it was just melee attack power, not strength. And then yea in TBC they made attack power a single stat for ranged and melee I think.
---
sendt i PM :)
---
If you hate pulling one mob at a time and don't know how to plan up your leveling path to avoid fighting with orange/red mobs just don't roll a tough to lvl classes like a rogue or a warrior and roll a hunter or a warlock :)
---
I never spent much time there honestly, I'll have to give it a second shot when classic comes out :). 
---
I get the website point, to be honest. What I really miss is browsing the public section of the guild forum (I also just miss guild forums, I was the fucking king of reviewing guild applications during high school classes) just to get an idea of the vibe in the guild before you joined. It was great for getting a feel of the guilds tone and social dynamics before you joined, if any significant part was made public of course.
---
I miss how the sites also acted as an informal history book of the guild. If you went back a year, or more if your guild was real old, in the news or forum posts you could find some great old enshrined moments, jokes, or interactions. That stuff usually only lasts a week, tops, in a discord chat and a post in the #announcements just doesn't have the same weight as a news post with a screenshot somehow. 
---
&gt;Also I never said anything about "only accept dwarf priests in guilds", stop putting words in my mouth.
---
I didnt, that was a general comment. 
---
But comments you DID say like "Really, Dwarf is the only choice for Alliance priests" isn't helpful either. 
---
The raids already been cleared before, its a re-visit to an old world where community matter more than doing a raid through LFR as fast as possible. 
---
Lets just have some fun returning, aye?
---
That's fair. To each their own :) 
---
There is a worse situation where the game is already ready but Blizzard isn’t releasing it because some nutters connected the wrong dots and essentially gave them an easteregg marketing campaign for free.
---
Perplexity was one of the first that popped into my mind, due to higher quality bitrate of videos. If you want to look at rogues in the same time frame that had similar levels of skill, Ming is a great example.
---
Do ret pallies do well in Naxx with exorcism?
---
I remember putting my leveling progress in my MSN status... good times!
---
I think you underestimate the damage that lesser and greater magic wands do at levels 5-20. 
---
Don't get me wrong, spirit tap is an amazing leveling talent, and you should definitely get it second. But wand damage is even better if you can get your hands on the enchanting crafted wands.
---
The point is, that since 1 year everyone is telling every newcomer to go dwarf. 
---
The point is that this notion is ridiculous in and of itself, because the racial accounts for less than 10% of all encounters you will engage in. It's the most optimal pick and having it makes a lot easier, but telling people its the only "choice" you have or else you suck it just stupid.
---
If you would believe this subreddit, a raid that has a nightelf or human priest in it will potentially never clear BWL because only casuals have them in their raids. It's a completely false perception, based on a false promise on how "one-sided" the choice is, where there is enough reason to just accept that dwarf is absolutely great, but definitely not a must-go.
---
I never had issues with planning my leveling, it was just tedious with very little in the way of reward if you ended up not being able to play the spec you wanted. That is what matters most to this, what do I get out of my time.
---
Min/maxers never stop apparently: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bajhfp/all_priests_are_going_to_work_some_priests_work/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
And I changed my top choices to the exact opposite. From warrior, rogue, priest and mage to warlock and Paladin. 
---
There's definitely a place for a well played shadow priest. I'll even go as far as saying there is a place for a dedicated, hard working ret Pally. Both may not top meters...ever but well played, knowledgeable shadow priests and ret pallys can be valuable additions to a raid team. Granted, you'd only want 1 of each but they can work. My old vanilla raiding guild had an exceptional shadow priest and ret pally and we did fine. Am I saying that every shadow priest and ret Pally are going to be valuable on every raid team? Obviously not. I'd say 95% of the people who play either spec in PvE are, at best, terrible but the good ones can be damn good. 
---
The biggest issue for shadow priests and ret pallys is their "skill" ceiling. A fury warrior, for instance, can be half assed buffed, piss drunk and literally mashing keys and still make top 15 on a dps meter no problem. I know because I've done it. The problem is the difference between a well played, fully buffed shadow priest or ret Pally versus the ones who are not is literally being able to be around that 10 to 15 range on the meters versus doing less dps than the warrior tank. There really isnt an in between. I dont blame guilds for not wanting to take either spec. Like I said, 95% or better of the people who play those specs are, at best, terrible and terrible is a waste of a raid spot
---
Nice try. Genuine baddies get kicked. There is a ridiculous amount of information about what numbers various specs should be pulling at different stages of the game. Not an advocate of any tryharding. But, GMs, and class leaders, will know when someone is intentionally holding the group back.
---
What a sad state of affairs.
---
I never understood people obsessed about playing a certain spec.
---
True that!
---
You forgot to mention rose-tinted glasses.
---
Absolutely, it all depends on what you find fun. It just seems to me that there's a disconnect between being fully prepared with consumables every raid, and playing a ret paladin, which will exclude you from playing in most good guilds.
---
It doesn't really matter how hard raids are, AQ and naxx aren't super hard either, what matters most is mentality and the amount of work and preparation people are willing to put in, and most people who are willing to do that, will not want to have something like a ret paladin in their raid, since they just aren't capable of pulling their weight when compared to something like a warrior.
---
You forget the 5 gold worth of throwing weapons used to kill it ;)
---
There is no rogue spec that is "best" for PVP that is also "best" for PVE.
---
Hemo with Dal Rends is great at tier0 levels of gear for PVP and farming. It is ass in PVE.
---
You can go combat daggers and it works great in PVE if you have the MC gloves and DM belt, as well as Perdi and CHT. Until that, dal rends combat swords will out perform, especially as Human. As a human I'd prob never go daggers unless I have the best MH dagger for that gear tier and want to camp BRM enterance and kill priests/mages.
---
I’ll help you get started. You probably shouldn’t roll death knight, monk, or demon hunter, but the rest of the choices are pretty solid. Hope that helps. 
---
You just reposted an image that was OC and submitted to this board 2 hours ago. You're a big fat phony.
---
Those last fuckers you mentioned from AQ40 are probably the biggest reason FW is nice tbh x)
---
I try not to look into things too much, but “look forward to a classic summer” wouldn’t be smart for them to say if 3/4 of the summer is passed.
---
Gnomes have been in Warcraft lore since WC2. That said, they were the engineers and inventors, and not really frontline troops. The idea of a gnome fighting an orc is kind of silly as the gnome is roughly the size of the orc’s arm, but then so is the idea of anything other than maybe a Tauren tanking a dragon, so it is what it is.
---
When you compare the racials, Dwarf is the only actually good choice, yes. Starshards/dodge are useless for healing, and +5% spirit is negligible.
---
You can have fun without flailing around like an idiot and making subpar character choices.
---
Cow?
---
So would you also not buff Salvation as a paladin because Horde casters can control their aggro, so Alliance casters should too? 
---
I rather enjoy Swamp of Sorrows. Lots of squishy beasts to skin, a gloomy atmosphere. It’s a fun place to be, except for those damn sand throwing Murlocs by the shore.
---
If anything, it's good to know that you felt so attacked and hurt by our discussion that you do this.
---
It honestly kind of pitiful. 
---
Tauren, Cows, Bovidae... You know?
---
IIRC, thorns and similar debuffs actually reduced the amount of XP that you would get from mobs.. I will actually be playing with a druid duo as well, but it would be something to consider. MOTW + LotP will be really excellent, and having a 2nd person with you, stealthed, would be really advantageous in PVP.
---
Huh, neat. Possible it's a server-specific bug though.
---
Grinding ogres for loot and cloth was pretty good for gaining levels at 50+ especially 55+ Silithus was introduced and more WS quests were added.
---
It’s also fairly uncontested so you could farm to your hearts desire.
---
My strongest memory of Winterstring is having to kill 60 Yetis because the drop rate on Pristine Yeti Horns was so low.
---
&gt; weird items and engineering
---
Aka playing well
---
But then how would they use the vanilla login screen/music instead of BFA?
---
just get a 2nd monitor to keep yourself busy
---
Worst part is - you can't use high-level ress spells on lowbies. Every rank of druid ress uses a different consumable. You need 6 different fucking nuts and berries to be able to ress everyone of all levels.
---
Also it's purple 
---
Thanks for confirming you didn't even read a word of text on the image :)
---
What if the change is to have even fewer changes :o
---
Take the Zepp to Grom'Gol and start swimming. It is pretty common to do DM on pservers.
---
Lol, yeah. My Alienware 17 R5 should be at my crib no later than Wednesday. I got the I9, 1070 factory OC, 1440p 120 hz g sync panel, 500 GB SSD, 1 TB HD and 32 gigs of RAM. Planning on doing more traveling so I figured I needed a "light" 10 pound gaming laptop for those quiet moments, lol
---
Great story!
---
I really hope the Classic Server communities end up like they were back then. It seems like all gaming communities nowadays all full of toxic and selfish behaviors.
---
You can’t understand people playing a game how they want to?
---
Rofl, I can't imagine the mentality it takes to make this statement.
---
Classic players are also paying 15/month for an old game that doesn’t need to be remade from scratch, and we also *already bought the game*. 
---
If you had to buy BFA twice to play it, then it would be fair. But as it stands, many people have already bought nearly every expansion. It would be wrong to take it away from people who already put 300 in subs into the expansion, plus the 40 box, and then dangle it in front of them with another purchase fee.
---
I wish the sub was smaller, but given that it’s paired with retail, I suppose it’s fair. But it would be scummy and just horrible optics for Blizzard to make people repurchase a game. 
---
The pathing is an artifact of Mangos. It shouldn't work on classic, but it's still super neat on Mangos based Pservers \^\^
---
I can still perfectly hear the music of that zone in my head.
---
I think you're correct. I double checked around the vanilla database sites and they all say melee attack power. I guess I must have misremembered.
---
No problem bro, remember, you're going to get a LOT of hate for being a ret/enhancement player, so much hate it'll make your head spin, you could give everyone on the server a million gold each and there would still be people who hate you for playing what you play, just ignore them and keep doing what YOU want.
---
And then there's Chad Shaman with Tremor totem.
---
Um. It's a feral\restoration spec. Very gear\skill heavy. Extremely versatile but you can have 1-2 in raid tops. I raid heal/ OHSHIT NS (nature's swiftness) full heal tank ^^
---
I guess there's a lot I can only see for myself. I'm gonna try it for sure! 
---
yall really gonna sleep on hex of weakness? thats like the main reason to go troll. It gimps all the paladins on the alliance team helloo?
---
Wow, that makes it even more petty.
---
I just decided to check this sub out after unsubbing for a bit and God damn, it's still a huge fucking circle jerk. Yes, modern WoW is different than Vanilla we all fucking know. Why is this sub solely based on trashing modern wow instead of discussing classic wow...
---
Oh and zhc is a on use trinket for massive healing, and blue dragon is a trinket that mimics the priest/druid 2pc set bonus for t2 (stacks)
---
I agree with you that especially in dungeons, I don't find I use it that much in emergencies. Emergencies is usually either a DPS overaggroes and then either dies or lives until the mob dies instead, or it's a full group wipe. The thing with the CR is that sometimes you have a death in, say, early scholomance and the DPS is whining for you to spend to CD. The dungeon is fairly long though, so you need to sort of balance whether to spare the 5min run he's facing now or save it until later where someone dies and it's a 15min run cause you're now deep in the instance without a warlock. I'm usually faced with those sorts of dilemmas rather than 5min corpse run vs. a MLG game-saving ress on the last boss.
---
Go fuck yourself with that late August shit. Better to have it early summer 
---
Choosing a class where you love 1 talent tree and hate 2 others is not a wise decision. Otherwise not being allowed to PvE in certain spec won't be a big deal.
---
&gt;you don’t even need tranq shots for gluth 
---
Wat?  Please explain.
---
Thank you so much! I guess I'm just desperately impatient for the release. :-)
---
FYI in case you didn't notice, there's also a checkbox near the top right to change between PTR, Live, and Classic. 
---
I think once the tourists and Private server crowds leave if Blizzard doesn't ruin the experience with sharding or something I feel those left will be able to carry on what we all started years ago.
---
I really hope that guy didnt fuck up by casually saying that not knowing thatd we'd take it as the entire summer
---
Just imagine the amount of new friends you'll have in a year
---
Discord functions as so many things at once where a website cannot.
---
You can at all times have forum posts
---
You can have quick short converstations
---
You can post memes instantiously
---
You can have voice
---
You can see who's online
---
You can private message people.
---
All of that, no forum can replace it. It's easy, free and convenient 
---
Ok- what I’m saying is if you want to min/max your character you’re better off just PvPing as holy. The strength of ret isn’t from the damage, it’s the survivability. So at that point for anything outside of 1v1s (essentially anything organized) you would be better off as a Hpal.
---
Ele is really bursty, decently tanky and has limited mobility. However they bring a ton of utility with totems. But that means you’re also dealing with totems (lol). On the horde side ele shams are really strong in organized PvP 
---
It’s used for lots of engineering things, jumper cables come to mind. 
---
Not to mention it removed a super unique mechanic, one of the few they've introduced. It was kind of like a throwback to the pre-launch zombie event, I found it awesome and was always begging for a DK ghoul ress just for the luls.
---
I also had a 3x24 nvidia 3dvision surround setup and it was amazing. I am even considering a 32:9 setup atm.
---
BiASSed!
---
And this is why they automated the process
---
Smart move lol
---
Yep, and I recently bought a surface pro 6 to play classic on a tablet. Portability will help to be a functional adult with a wow addiction.
---
shh let them sleep
---
&gt; There's a reason why Blizzard made fear ward baseline for all Priests in TBC. (albeit in 2.3, pretty late into the expac) It's just that powerful.
---
I wish they had buffed the weaker racials instead of homogenizing the races.
---
Nothing is a guarantee, but given that you don't know what race\class he's going to play, OR your day one server population - exploration XP is probably your best option.
---
You can both get level 5 in about an hour, and I think some exploration routes go all the way to level ten in 3-5(?) or so. They work for every race, so you could make it work and meet up in the barrens\darkshore\westfall regardless of what he picks or where he starts.

It definitely doesn’t work the same, afaik.

Crits should be a 2 roll system, meaning roll to hit etc, roll to crit.  Also throw in 1% miss and chances to resist, partial resist.
---
... you're pretty close. But I actually love twitch. I just wonder how classic will fair on it. 
---
I'm shocked no one's brought up how hunters shouldnt even be holding a knife in this picture either. Their dps becomes trash tier beginning in AQ40 if I remember correctly
---
I knew I wanted to play classic, so I didn't go all out. Got a 7700 and 1060. Overkill for classic but, can still play bfa with minimal hiccups on reccomended settings. 
---
You just proved my point...
---
Why would you want to join a guild where "Easy, free, and convenient" is the modus operandi? 
---
Okay, cool, you do you. That's the beauty of classic!
---
But try to avoid telling me what I should do :)
---
Same. I'm a huge fan of asmon, but I'll let him do his own thing.
---
Can you comment on why you felt resto sham was a waste in pvp? Is it just because of how crazy the damage was in vanilla?
---
&gt; Exalted AQ ring
---
You mean the Brood Rep ring? There is no AQ rep faction, just CC and Brood.
---
As farm as farm goes, assume you only have the inclination or time to farm one item -- or that farming a second would take a very long time. In a vacuum, which item is better for spriests and should be prioritized first?
---
If my memory serves (it's been ages), mining is more lucrative at lower levels, but herbalism surpasses it once once you get to the level 40+ zones. Getting both herbalism and mining is extremely lucrative but changing the tracker back and forth is a huge pain in the ass.
---
I might just have to do that on classic.
---
&gt;Never heard any mention of Un'goro, Winterpsring, etc. in wc3
---

---
My gripe with it is the actual terrain + the mob density. You cannot run across Un'goro without having to remount a billion times, usually after aggroing some fucking bat.
---
You know, I'm glad I'm not the only one to at least think of it . It probably won't ruin everything,  but it's going to change things a tad.
---
Elite casuals mad as hell.
---
Enhancement Shaman is better than ret cause you can go into imp wf totem and help with nightfall, but unless you enter a fairly casual guild you'll probably miss out on a lot of raids.
---
Although you don't really need a tranq during Naxx, hunters still bring trueshot aura for your melees and are the best pullers through their instant cast, 41 yard shots.
---
Guilds bring multiple hunters early on during MC/BWL. You need a minimum of 2 for tranq shot in MC/BWL, and guilds frequently bring 3 to be safe, some even bring 4. Guilds still bring 1-2 hunters during Naxx, some bring 3, but I don't think I've seen much more than that. Guilds that still have more than those numbers might rotate the hunters either throughout the raid night or between weeks.
---
So exploration was our original plan, and the main reason was because it is the only 100% definitive source of EXP that will not change (Sure the values may change but the gaining of exp wont) - I do worry however that many sources say that realistically its not going to be more advantageous than the starting zones, which means while we are even on levels we will not be even on gear. 
---
Humans have perception for PvP. Shadowmeld helps for PvP. Aesthetics matter too.
---
Isn’t it weird that there are no gnomes or trolls in this? 
---
&gt;Did you play TBC or just ROC?
---
hmm, what if someone never played TBC, but played TFT?
---
Just seeing this now and it's awesome! Did you ever make a video about this?
---
There is a difference between funneling loot to players for gameplay reasons (tank, attendance, utlization) and corrupt reasons (nepotism, favoritism)
---
Never felt anything close to this. It's pretty great that people can roleplay on a level like this though.

---
&gt;why priests  
---
&gt; ?
---
because Jesus is not Allah
---
\- that's the short answer.
---
Long answer: They worship different Gods.
---
As a druid, you'll be fine. The gear is... a non issue. Worse case scenario he picks warrior\paladin, and he's a level 5 with an 0.9 DPS 2H instead of a 3 DPS weapon. That doesn't prevent him from getting it at level 5 instead of 1, or doing it out the gate - to your point the value is that it's guaranteed. It's a LOT easier to plan to explore, and if for whatever reason your starter zone is dead, then yeah just go normal.
---
If you could tell me right now i'd be level 10 on launch day in under 5 hours, but I'd be completely naked, I'd take it in a heartbeat! You will be lacking silver for your first few skills, but again once you start killing things you'll be fine.
---
Yeah, you are absolutely right that the problem is that people are too extreme on both side in this community. I was watching a video from a popular guy (don't remember his name) that got linked here on youtube, the title was like "i cleared naxx, was it actually that hard?" And the guy started explaining what his guild did in order to clear Naxx, for exemple that his guild would go get ALL the world buffs , onyxia head/nef/zg ect at every start of a raid and at every attempt on kel'thusaf, which is wayyy too fucking insane. If you don't know, to trigger one of those buffs, you need to have killed a boss (nef/ony/hakar) and turn in the quest, which means if they used like 3 buffs a week, they needed to complet 3 bwl, ony and zg a week. It's crazy, that's not realistic at all, you don't need all that to be able to clear Naxx and no one except guilds like Method are gonna do that ...
---
It was a thing in vanilla. The most hardcore guilds on my server used it and the less hardcore used dkp.
---
I'll be a holy pally leveling with a warrior tank and a warlock. How many points should I put into holy to keep my group up during questing and dungeons?
---
I figured that I'll be the only one ever needing a downtime since the warrior will get healed up and the warlock will just life tap for mana which I'll have to heal up too. So I want to put enough into holy to do that and not having to drink too much, and the rest of the points will go into Ret to speed up the leveling a bit. Should I go 20 down to get Illumation (incl. Healing Light and Divine Intellect), even further (Imp. BoW, even Holy Power?) or will that be overkill?
---
Must just be a symptom of the participation trophy generation. Everyone deserves to be rewarded just for participating in something...instead of the experience of participating being the reward...and trophies being reserved for THE BEST PLAYERS/TEAM. Now, we have a whole gereration of people who never learned to accept that it is okay to suck at things...or to be decent but not the best. It blows my mind when people cry about content not being available to them in Classic WoW when it is available if they put in the work. What is even more mind blowing is all the retail fanboys shitting on Classic when no one is forcing them to play it...but they won't be happy with anything that doesn't include being rewarded for putting in next to no effort. 
---
Hah! Thanks for catching my mistake. Too many acronyms :) thanks Gael. 
---
You forgot the most important reason why dwarves are the undisputed best. We are the master race. All other races are there either to serve us, such as our Night Elf whores and human laborers/cannon fodder, or they are there for us to destroy because they are vermin, ie all horde races. All glory to the Dwarves!!!
---
The best player I even encountered was another Warrior I met in Orgrimmar. It was late Vanilla and this level 60 warrior whispered me out of nowhere the most helpful and non-threatening message regarding my gear. I was level 40 and apparently the cloth, leather and Int gear made me stand out a bit. I thought the higher the item level the better, regardless of stats. I was a solo player and so I never asked or looked for help.
---
He was kind enough to talk me through more ideal stats, skills and strategies. He even brought me out in the wild and walked me through his rotation. It was amazing to watch how fast and efficient he was. My results were night and day.
---
After about an hour or so he complimented me on my ability to learn quickly, then rode off into the night on his epic mount.
---
Looking back, he may not have been the best player ever, but to this day he was certainly the most helpful, selfless and patient person I have ever encountered in a video game.
---
I started on a classic private server about 2 weeks after bc came out. I joined retail shortly after. So, I didn't get the full experience. I'm beyond stoked. 
---
Don't forget an irc too!
---
Fake news
---
Hey, man, if they want to go that far back mad props to them. XD
---
Don’t you have a phone?
---
Resistances are %100 guess work on private servers bud
---
This is the positive reinforcement I need.  Excite!
---
&gt; One of the biggest changes
---
And here I thought those were things like class balance, flying, dual spec, daily quests, multi-mailing, and a searchable bag.
---
Is that the tendency? that level 10 can take up to as long as 5 hours on a fresh? - I have never been able to attend a server release so knowledge on time to level is quite the myth to me. 
---
That far? It was still popular in 2004.
---
It requires more guild member buy-in that flat DKP, sure.  And it stops some Paladin or Hunter from stockpiling DKP to snag Thunderfury instead of a Main Tank.
---
If your response is *"no serious guild would ever let that happen though,"* then you're already agreeing with me.
---
Why do u say rouge instead of rogue
---
Seriously?...
---
&gt;I like LC for modern smaller groups, do you think it will translate well to classic?
---
there will be some conservative guilds, though.
---
June to September
---
good times
---
Yep, that was the joke =p
---
The big deal is and you keep side skirting it, you couldn’t play the class how you wanted if you played a Druid, paladin, you were destined to be a tank or a healer, I won’t even mention Shamans. 
---
You must be one of me darling Night Elf hunters. How about getting on that mailbox lassie and showing us what you got
---
Sure matey. I had no intention to go in depth in anyway since the discussion was around HT but fine. Raided through every tier aswell btw, I know how the healing pattern changes. That's that im done.  :))))))))))))))))
---
You learn something new every day. :V
---
What matters is not whether or not your spec is gimped, what matters is if you're playing the best spec for your raid.
---
Which, for one priest, is going to be shadow-weaving + holy, for two mages, is going to be winter's chill deep frost, etc.
---
I like how Eastern Kingdoms is still just called 'Azeroth' on the map.
---
A big NO for FB group, or anything like that. I once created my character's FB account just for that, joined the guild group, then got banned and asked to submit ID card. Because FB wanted me to join with my RL character instead.
---
Unlike shadow priests, hunters are necessary for tranq shot.
---
I mean, there weren't a lot of good group chat type programs back in the day. 
---
&gt;Can I just say how much WoW Classic means to me?
---
NO. And, by the way, you don't want that. You think you do, but you don't.
---
If I'm being honest you really won't need any in holy for leveling. Go ret-reckoning for utility and damage and don't look back. Going deep into holy (for priest too) really doesn't impact your build that much at those low levels. You will be more than capable of keeping your group up as ret/reckoning throwing occasional heals between your white hits and reck bombs.
---
Yeah, but I figured most people just used forums/ventrillo back then. I never really heard of IRC channels for WoW back then.
---
Blood and Thunder!
---
I rez the gnome, maybe he has engi, because gnomes often have engi. Maybe he'll rez the human. The rest are night elves, so they corpserun faster.
---
&gt; In my opinion changes to items is more manageable than talent changes and I don’t put them on the same level of importance.
---
What?
---
Changing items has far more reaching effects then changing a single spec's talents, because they also impact other classes.
---
I wonder if classic will have pathing exploits like this. I thought they were all obliterated in the same patch that fixed blink.
---
Honestly, go with what playstyle you enjoy more.
---
Once you get to a certain level (slightly after pre raid bis) for dagger rogues, farming isnt as much of a problem as it is prior.
---
Other than that they do similar dps, depending on spec.
---
Gluth's frenzy is nowhere near as dangerous as Chromaggus' or Magmadar's. Chromaggus is especially dangerous because it can stack on top of the 20% soft enrage. 
---
&gt; Gluth's enrage
---
* Physical damage dealt is increased by 500.
---
* Attack speed increased by 50%.
---
&gt; Magmadar and Chromaggus' enrage
---
* Attack speed increased by 150%
---
&gt; Chromaggus' soft enrage @20%
---
* Attack speed increased by 50%
---
Gluth also doesn't hit as hard as other bosses in Naxxramas. The challenge of the fight is making sure he doesn't eat zombies and dealing with the stacking healing debuff on the tank.
---
...you didn't notice that I completely changed all the text?
---
I'd rather be given the opportunity to know the nature of the people I associate with, than to be 'protected' from them.  Muting them both robs me of that ability, and their ability to redeem themselves. 
---
Shamans are, actually, most valuable DPSers out of these 3. But that's how vanilla works. Roll the class if you like all parts of it. If the class is capable of healing you should like doing so. If a class have pets you should like to micromanage them. If a class has valuable buffs you should be ready to spam them on the raid after every wipe. If you would like healing then going for progress as a heal spec won't be a big deal.
---
I _really_ like the idea. Gear goals for every 10 levels or so would be cool, or for key dungeons (e.g. how to prep before farming SM)
---
What professions would you guys recommend? I’m planning to go orc shaman, healing in end game. I’m torn between herb/alch and tailor/enchant. 
---
Through vanilla and TBC I played with a Warlock who was just extremely competent, very good at PvP. In TBC he was always one of the top 10 Warlocks in arena (not for our server, for the entire game). 
---
I eventually found out he played on a god damn laptop with one of those little nubbin/nipple mice built into the keyboard. 
---
A key money saver I learned levelling alts was to only get skills and upgrades that were actually needed. Others can wait for a while. 
---
Honestly, no idea. Un'Goro, because of its crystal pylons and morrowgrain quests? Azshara, because that Ragnaros potions? Duskwood, because stitches and all that unique things?
---
Four words:
---
Mind Control plus Shadowmeld
---
Your best bet is probably a Sanctuary Paladin — only need one in a raid, but it allows you to spec into Prot, making you Tammy enough to farm. It weakens your healing a bit, but Sanctuary on the tank makes you valuable in the raid.
---
There were places in retail vanilla/tbc that had wonky pathing like that. They feature prominently in this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SvJPoHog1A
---
Sure it does, I'm not going to be spending all my time in a raid, I want a spec that I can work with outside of the raid too. 
---
Running a gimp spec just because the guild is too full of itself to let a shadow priest do the job, no way in hell.
---
Devilsaur mafias function through crossfaction collusion which I'm 99% sure blizzard will ban them for. You might have groups of people try to control devilsaur but you can always out tag them or rotate faster to the next spawns if you are same faction or kill them if you are opposite faction if there is no collusion. Once the enemy faction starts running interference on trying to out farm the people on your faction is when it becomes an issue. 
---
I'm still waiting. You just keep typing "false" to everything, so Ill assume you are just an idiot.
---
Unfortunately, they accidentally disclosed the release date to the other shard, than the players are on.
---
m
---
lmao.. Yes, because resistances affect Druid tanks a lot.
---
You're speaking from the context of a min max guild on servers of populations 5k+
---
There's guilds and folks that care less about min maxing and there's going to be guilds looking to fill spots with whatever they can get.  
---
let me
---
help you:
---
warrior 
---
I need salty casual tears for my daily dose of electrolytes. This sub is filled with awful players so when you make a truthful comment like mine, it's easy to get the downvotes and the tears flowing.
---
Yeah, it's 100% for certain a private server bug. Was still neat.
---
Yeah vanilla isn't tightly tuned by any means. You can certainly bring sub par players and even more so you can do a lot of the content without a full 40 roster. If you are going to go the non min max route you can certainly bring more then one shadow priest or ret paladin and clear the content esp if your raid is full consumables / world buffed.  
---
I was just saying as far as getting more min max raid comp alot of people just use a holy priest and with shadow weaving and just refresh the debuff. Min maxing isn't required to clear content in vanilla by any means and you can bringa few sub par players, a few sub par specs or even have less than 40 players. You just can't have a lot of them.
---
There's not much that you could do to "balance" a damage spell and a spirit bonus VS a fear immunity buff.
---
Racist, poor Danes 
---
Yeah. Lots of reasons I should go Alliance (love Teldrassil, maybe better for druid, new experience) . . . But I just can't. It would feel like treason :-(
---
lmao. why. just put on the internet and spirit gear you find as you level. this is so unnecessary. 
---
Pre BWL gear, or even pre raid gear, fury can pull 300-350 dps fairly easily single target. Nothing amazing, but definitely viable. They may not be number one on meters, but are definitely viable. They are almost required in MC, as there are a bunch of bosses you want 4+ tanks for, and you don’t want to drag that many prot spec warriors through with you
---
Nice thankyou! I’ll do exactly that :)
---
Nothing wrong with using consumables when they're necessary, like on progress or if you're still having trouble with a certain boss even on farm. But to always juice up to the teeth for no good reason is really weird. Having content on farm is where you can ease up on things like that and start saving gold, not keep spending it.
---
1 Horizontal Monitor, 1 Vertical Monitor; Mounted to a 2 arm adjustable monitor desk mount.
---
Keep your game on the Horizontal
---
Everything else on the Vertical
---
lol you did it bud. you moved some pics together with paint and added some poorly spelled and loosely comparable captions underneath. now you are allowed to not play a dwarf. 
---
What i think is a bit sad that everyone will rush content to be pokemon starts and fight for nr on global completion list. 
---
Left retail after wotlk ended , came back now to sniff the air, leveled a new priest to max ( as my inly friend still playing retail had migrated to different realm) amd was greatly dissapoi ted that everyone now has selfheals and you basicly cant outsmart anyone who is higher level than you are. They just run up to low lvl mod , kill him and boom they have half of their ho back. 
---
I also dislike how my disc priest has lost almost all hes abilities and even thou the gameplay change of disc is interesting , im not a fan of it.
---
Classic and tbc will always be remembered becaue every single thing was new. And at that time i had almost no knowledge of english language or about possibility to google quests so i read almost all of them ( and i leveled as a hily priest , but thats a different story)
---
Yeah it's min maxxing, but that was the reality of vanilla wow if you wanted to progress through content.
---
People can do whatever they want, but back in the day there were guilds who just played whatever raid comp they wanted and they would struggle through ZG...
---
It's not so much about telling people what to play,  my point is to calibrate expectations for people who didn't play vanilla
---
Underrated comment.
---
People here seem to think that their experience of 3000k people online at all times per faction is normal or will be replicated in classic. 
---
Also, in my experience, the people that take meme specs to raids often perform better than average, because they have something to prove and they want to make it work. 
---
So if someone who's new to vanilla is asking for advice, we should just tell them not to worry about anything and play whatever they want?
---
Sure that sounds great and wonderful, but it's also misleading, because your choises do matter, they will have an impact on your gameplay in both pvp and pve.
---
Going dwarf priest, or not picking a meme spec will absolutely make it easier to get into a guild, and not just HC guild. Plenty of casual guilds try follow the meta as well.
---
Noone says that you HAVE to play dwarf priest, but it'd be straight up lying to say that people aren't going to try to recruit dwarfs over the other races.
---
And this isn't anything new either, this was very much the case back in vanilla as well.
---
Again, noone is forcing anyone to do anything, but your race/class/spec choices can and do have an impact on your gameplay. 
---
And I do think that it is important to break down the pros and cons of each choice so people can make a proper decision.
---
i selfishly want to stare at a night elf’s pixels instead of helping my group waaah
---
Is there an addon to track that, or just a GM who loves spreadsheets? :P
---
I agree and disagree with both of you. I also pity both of you, because LOKTAR OGAR
---
Anyone think it's weird that they said "Classic Summer" and yet Summer is just 75 days away but no date has been announced?
---
If they release in late July/August it's not really a Classic summer.
---
Their timing is critical here. Once they announce a date they have to stick with it because many people like myself will schedule vacation time from work to coincide with the launch.
---
Lol yes it was a giant spreadsheet built into our website so that only officers could access it. 
---
found the real reason this guy made this chart/wants to justify playing priest so bad. 
---
who cares if you bring significantly less utility to the raid. 
---
Definitely agree. The issue my old Vanilla guild ran into was having too many sub par specs and players when we got into BWL and, like many guilds at the time, got butt raped by Vael the guild killer. We had to get more dedicated and, as part of the officer team, we had to enforce raid rules more strictly after that. Thankfully we were eventually able to get over that hump but it nearly destroyed us. 
---
Due to that experience, you'll see me defend certain things that are not necessarily min/max approved but I'll try to point out the reality of choosing that route. Unfortunately, far too many people out there dont realize or give enough consideration to the problems that arise when going too far against established facts. Can one make them work? Maybe BUT it requires alot more work. Frequently for everyone
---
1-2lvl - 400xp,  2-3lvl - 900xp,  3-4lvl - 1400,  4-5lvl - 2100,  5-6lvl - 2800,  6-7lvl - 3600.
---
if you are lvl 1, and he is level 3. thats a 1300 xp discrepancy. which means at lvl 4 you already be at the same level. just cos low level don't weight much in xp. 
---
even if you recieved the exact the same xp from mobs. which isnt the case since he is higher level he get less xp and you get more. So it naturally equals up.
---
so don't worry about it just level together, and you be about the same level at level 6 or so, very quickly.  if you have some difference together on the very beggining its not a big deal at all. its doesnt mean that when you'd be level 6 he'd be level 8. 
---
Also remeber there are class quests, so you have to split anyways. or get different xp. bear form quest for isntance, you friend wont possibly be able to follow you to moonglade. 
---
also i honestly not sure can orc shamans do earth totem quest in the mulgore or cant.
---
~
---
as for combos, druid+shaman is one the most fun combos for leveling in my opinion just overall, so i'd reccomend it. cat+wolf speedy combo, both can support and heal each other, a ton of utility spells and compensate for each other weakness, also can fill any needed roles in a dungeon groups. 
---
also a small tip at launch, we don't knwo if there gonna be a sharding or not yet, or maybe a big shards still. or whethere gonna be dynamic spawns. 
---
anyways if 1-6 quests are hard to do and there are ton of ppl, just staight go kill level 5-6 mobs in a group there are a ton of them, and skip 1-6 area entirely. (in case of a shaman, he'll need to come back and do earth totem quest at some point later, when its doable).
---
You can do a hemo/deadliness build with servo arm. I'd imagine that would be a lot stronger than seal fate maces.
---
Agrees. Still I made 100g roughly each morning and was self sufficient with pots as I was a herbalist/alchemist.  I never had gold problems but I was cloth not plate so my repair was cheaper.  
---
and ESO in early June.
---
Sure you can, if you reach a certain point and burn out then you've failed. 
---
Hear hear!
---
props to the one guy in your guild who decided to help everyone else out so the rest of the priests could “look cooler”. 
---
But you could probably increase the Spirit percentage bonus until you reach a point where deciding between that and Fear Ward is difficult.
---
Not really, without making it insanely OP.
---
You're right and I harbor no illusions that my tone is anything but mean here. I am just sick of it, though. What put me over the line was reading a person saying they are going to play Holy Paladin but won't wear anything but plate. I can't understand it.
---
What does it matter, wearing cloth? No one is looking at you closely, the only person the aesthetic matters to is yourself. And if you are only playing to look cool, why not just play with action figures or play single player games or the Sims?
---
There's no greater misery to me than trying to understand the logistics of being bad and doing nothing about it.
---
Went with a ryzen 1700 + gtx 1080 build a year and a half ago. Most of its life will definitely be playing classic. Despite that being sufficient enough I really want a Zen 2 cpu if the rumored specs are true.
---
fucking relax. 
---
I think that is one of the reaons that he decided to play Shammy/Paladin because it meant we can fill all roles. I think the general plan is to stop racing level 55 - 57 ish and then just hammer instances for BiS Gear.
---
On a fresh server is there really any point in following a levelling guide? I have not enough experience to know exactly where I should be heading at all times.
---
This guy stabs!
---
This is awesome, and is undoubtedly missed. Bring on the report spamming, and automated messages. 
---
Tribute runs in DM. Went fairly quick and chance at some great loot
---
Not really a "Classic Summer" if they release in late August. My bet is late June early July.
---
There is an ocean of difference between blizzard changing their game in 2005-2006 and knowing what those changes will be in 2019-2020.
---
No one was out collecting rosewine circles waiting for them to be buffed in 2006.
---
the first hour, level 1-5 to start Teldrassil: https://youtu.be/rscZrZ4JppY
---
I've also made about 1,000 changes since it was my 1-8 rush, it's now 1-10+ and a living document, so it may change over time some more.
---
Sorry but I have to call you out in this one. There's very specific gear breakpoints to make certain specs viable, and fury is one of them. If you didn't have the required +hit on your gear you were better off as arms DPS. There just wasn't the gear pre BWL to support Fury unless, like i said, you worked to get very specific items, and even then it was rough.
---
Fury was never even thought of as a legitimate raiding spec until Blizzard released BWL with dps plate armor.
---
Arms was always the low tier dps spec because your weapon did most of the work, fury is the opposite because it couldn't compete at all without 1000 ap unbuffed 25% Crit and like 9% to hit.
---
As I said previously, you can ignore all this and do whatever you want but a lot of vanilla content was gated by raid dps, and if you brought people into new content for your group, who didn't want to min max, you would handicap yourself.
---
You do not need to min max to progress through content. 
---
Also what happened 'back in the day' has very little relevance now, the player base is very different and we're talking about raids that are over a decade old.
---
loved peggle. 
---
As am I.  I'm so tired of people parroting NoChAnGES like some meme spewing repetitious seagull out of Finding Nemo.
---
It allows people to show up and do the bare minimum, pass on upgrades to save for the rare items (weapons usually) rather than them going to people who out-perform them.
---
If you want that Rogue that always seems to die, comes bottom of all the Rogues on damage and is half-afk during raids to have an avenue to taking the best items from the people that actually perform - please go ahead.
---
I won't be in that guild though.
---
Horde never got 'salvation' until there was a totem for it.  Just sayin'.  And it certainly wasn't available in Classic.
---
If you want to hear the arguments of who has a harder time raiding, I would suggest you go read the old forums wherein the Horde and Alliance discuss each of the classes, talents and "saving graces" available.  Alliance was easy mode for a long time, but complained about "shammy's being op".  No salvation for Horde, no Fear Ward, and we had to learn to control our aggro prior to aggro meters as well.  Then again, I raided using macros to tell me when I was standing in the fire...
---
Yup. I'm guessing that new 1660 is going to be overkill but I figured I'd build something a bit future proof
---
Desolace!
---
You can't ignore the fact that a lot of bosses had enrage timers that meant your raid needed a certain amount of DPS, and there were no alternate sources of gear to improve your dps aside from whatever new content your guild is trying to beat.
---
It has nothing to do with Strat or playstyle it's simply a math equation
---
I figured it was because they were the last races added and weren't even planned from the start IIRC. the cinematic was probably already in the works before trolls and gnomes were.
---
How to tell someone hasn't played vanilla: They think a 3 minute cd is "long".
---
If you think UD vs Troll in PvP is in any way "debatable", then you're not playing seriously enough to care about choosing a race for its abilities in the first place.
---
The good ol princess runs
---
I've been guesstimating mid-late August for the exact same reason.  There's been no closed/open beta announcements and they'd have to be nuts to release without them, unless they want to get facefucked with thousands of bug reports from pissed off fans who demand 100% perfection at launch.  Those players will quit and never look back if 1 pixel is out of place.
---
Yeah, how can you puke over something that does not exist?
---
Rp players are a small minority. If you want to play wow then play the game if you want to roleplay in costumes you can cosplay and do that irl.
---
You'd just have a bunch of empty new servers then :p Besides, a new server every 5.25 days is a tad excessive don't you think? ;)
---
Nothing says LC can't track raid attendance and previous loot to make an informed decision.  In a situation like that it would be in the best interest of the council to prevent the appearance of playing favorites among themselves.
---
I enjoyed this story so much. For me it was a Level 60 Human Paladin I met in BGs almost daily. He was my nemesis and when I saw him on the other time I wanted to win so badly. 
---
dont overestimate how much work is actually needed. if they have the nostalrius core most work is done.
---
Awesome! Thanks a bunch man this is great!!
---
Grim is a true retail Vanilla player, Perplexity did his vids on PServers in times where the game knowledge was vastly superior, it's not comparable, really. Back in Vanilla most people didn't even knew there was such thing as keybinds. And you couldn't even easily figure out Keybind's existence from watching WoW vids, because everything was in 240p and you couldn't see shit on the action bars of the player frapsing his gameplay. 
---
Oh and YouTube wasn't a thing back then. It was Google videos, WCM for the hardcores, and there was much less incentive to even use the internet for information in general. Nowadays whenever you want to know something you jump on Google. It wasn't like that back then. People taught stuff one another, and when it comes to WoW, that lead to a way lower average skill than today.
---
Either way, Grim was very good for his time, no matter the gear. He understood his class quite well. 
---
Good point. 
---
The people who would find that confusing, with all the item lists that are and will be available, are not playing on a level where they need to worry about pre-farming items in the first place.
---
Or this guy, HappyMinti :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvQoYMq8\_Ng&amp;t=932s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvQoYMq8_Ng&amp;t=932s)

---
Thank me.latet
---
&gt; So if someone who's new to vanilla is asking for advice, we should just tell them not to worry about anything and play whatever they want?
---
That more or less depends on the specific question, but if asked what is the optimal choice, then dwarf is the clear answer and I am not denying that.
---
&gt; Noone says that you HAVE to play dwarf priest
---
They DO. That's exactly the thing. Every single person is told to go dwarf or they won't get picked for raids. Every single person is told to go dwarf because their racial is the only one that matters. Every single person is told that going NE tells everyone that you have no idea what you are doing.
---
It may be said by different people, at different times, in different thread - But every thread has those people. Just as we have threads of people telling everyone that race does not matter at all (Which also is not true). 
---
&gt; And I do think that it is important to break down the pros and cons of each choice so people can make a proper decision.
---
Absolutely. But it is absolutely atrocious how the "go dwarf"-"meta" does not go away. It's super powerful, not denying that. People should know that it's powerful, not denying that. People should not be told to go dwarf or don't bother, because that's simply bullshit. A warning that people might choose a dwarf if there is none is acceptable, spreading panic that raid-leaders always choose dwarfs over other races is beyond any reasonable comprehension.
---
A holy/prot spellpower reckoning build would work. You'd still be mostly healing in BGs, but every 45 seconds or so you can stun someone and drop a 4k reckbomb on them.
---
Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qodXtYwTZuo
---
The reason people go to a new server on PS is because it always promises to be less buggy/corrupt/laggy than the previous ones. Obviously that won't be the case for Classic because they will all run the exact same code. People are not going to be continually abandoning their characters/servers and rerolling in Classic. So the only need for new servers will be if the playerbase grows crazily and they need to add more for capacity. Outside of that it's hard to imagine why they would launch new servers just "because" so people can experience #fresh. 
---
It's quite possible they might after 12 months or whatever for a little extra hype for a content release but no, they won't just schedule one to release every month.

Same. Going through the charred vale into Desilace to shadow pray village. Always seemed epic. 
---
When I did this quest on my low level Mage I just frostbolted the mob to half health and then kited it to the road towards one of the NPC guards which finished it off for me.
---
Nice post!  I just submitted an application for when Classic releases.  I really like what your guild is all about.
---
Crack her open on classic launch day!
---
You've not lived until you've emerged from a full BRD run, unsure what day it is, wondering if that "4" in the wall clock is AM or PM.
---
I know that this isn’t technically Classic, however, when this promotion was relevant, I had some great times that I expect to resurface when Classic launches 
---
Even in minmax raids
---
Yes you can !
---
Good arguments there, buddy.
---
I'm also sure that Troll is going to reconsider his race-choice after he stunned the rogue during his own stun, after being opened up upon. Wait...
---
Go mining/skinning up till you get your epic mount then drop skinning for engineering. Makes BRD farming even better when you can grab dark iron and once you’re pretty well geared you can do DM east jump runs with a healer and grab the thorium nodes.
---
You could also drop mining after you level up engineering and pick up herbalism or alchemy. Either farm herbs to sell/use for your consumables or buy herbs and flip potions/make your own consumables. Just depends on the market.
---
many guilds still run with multiple non-dwarf priests, just look at the logs. Most do have 1-2, but barely any guild has more than 3 because any raidleader with a brain rather has people with skill and high attendance than that one fotm clown who rolled dwarf for easy raidspots.
---
When you do the centaur questchain in the Barrens, at some point one of the quest mentions how the most dangerous clans come from Desolace, so back in vanilla I expected a war torned wasteland with centaurs roaming everywhere. It delivered on that but it also had ancient Elfic ruins, satyrs and naga, Maraudon and its legends, the Burning Blade, kodo graveyards, goblin caravanes, Tauren outpost and troll fishing village! When I did it on pserver I found it’s a great place to grind and there are a lot of hidden quests I missed in vanilla. Great zone overall. 
---
Herbs and Alc would probably be more useful to you overall. However I support people going with what ever profession they want regardless of class like a cloth with blacksmithing for example.
---
Considering I had to scroll to the bottom to get here...
---
!remindme 90 days
---
Lol your char name is Gaston
---
Yes a tank rarely has that luxary. They have huge rep costs, low ability to farm stuff in the outside world and often don't have any of the big gold making professions. 
---
Healers can have similar problems but not as bad.
---
It's no wonder that dps players hopped up on testosterone are the ones often pushing for everyone to use all consumables always, they have the ability to farm most of them a lot faster.
---
It isn't roleplay though. It is actual emotions on the part of the player.
---

*Hi human!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** ylteicz123! ^(hug)
---
who cares tho, this attitude is cancer, its classic and not world first mythic progression raiding, let people play what they want. 
---
&gt; Those week long AV games lol.
---
Unfortunately, they are releasing nerfed version of AV that resulted in just rushing the final boss.
---
Is the Tauren not a shaman?
---
no, the discussion was about nature's grace spec.  The whole point was you suggesting nature's grace is used in combination with HT when it's actually used for Regrowth spam
---
I've seen some videos of a holy reckoning build that does exactly what you ask
---
Wanting to perform well is "cancer" ?
---
As a Dane, I kind of feel left out :( 
---
&gt;There's no point in continuing this discussion, your mind is set in stone. Have fun wiping on Onyxia after the tank gets feared and the boss 1shots you and firebreaths the raid.
---
Don't Horde Priests do the same raids without Fear Ward?
---
Swede here! I'm definitely intrested, where can I find more info?
---
You said they're inferior in every way? OK how about mobility?
---
Actual social interaction and necessity 
---
Tremor Totem.
---
Unfortunately, Redemption, Lay on Hands and Divine Protection do not count towards DPS.
---
Roleplayers aren't autists, dude.
---
I was abnormally good at finding people. I would use /who to see what zone they were in, then based off their level I would pinpoint the questline they were on. 
---
Drink it
---
I hated being a paladin in classic because of... Well most of you.
---
The biggest change?
---
Wasn't that level cap increase?
---
Hi, /u/tyvar1
---
Nibba, please
---
Always a treat finding someone like that to join your group.
---
I just end up throwing Plead over...lol
---
Hopefully we'll also have access to all of those advanced graphics options available in 1.12. I mean weather effects and view distance. Plus the ability to enable color in ghost form, and such things.
---
So Horde players are intentionally gimping themselves?
---
What did you use this super power to accomplish?
---
thousands of dollars?
---
Never mind that, is that  Finkle's Lava Dredger? Lul.
---
I dont remember the forum post i saw a long time ago, but is was basiacally a sarcastic response to how boring/how much down time ret pallys had.
---
Bot looking forward to lvling my holy pal whan the classic servers come out
---
You might get accepted but it's face that most raiding guilds will hold a couple spots for dwarf priests. I was a raiding guild leader on a larger pserver and this was pretty much the norm on Alliance. We would get apps for priest that weren't dwarf but if we were full on priests save the 2 or 3 dwarf priests, we would have to pass on them. 
---
Waiting to rez, play bejeweled.
---
Based nightelf priest
---
&gt;perform well
---
being a dwarf has zero impacts on your performance.
---
I'd say the big issue is that Feedback and Elune's Grace in their current forms aren't even worth mentioning. That's where I'd focus the buffs. I don't know, give them better uptimes, make them targetable buffs, do *something*. Feedback can only be active 8% of the time and only on you. Fear Ward though? You could potentially have that active on 20 different raiders simultaneously.
---
Asymmetric balance *is* possible. It just requires a little more work.
---
I don't know why you talk so badly about leveling saying it's tedious and whatnot but then try to talk in favor of specs which are way more tedious to play if you want to start labeling anything that is a little arduous as that.
---
I can't imagine anyone actually having fun playing a Moonkin or an Elemental Shaman. You're doing mostly a 1-2 button rotation (same as another caster would do) but the difference is that you're oom in 1 minute and have to spend countless of hours farming things such as Demonic Runes only to make your mana last slightly longer, but even then no matter how hard you try and how many consumables you farm you'll go oom and you're going to be at the bottom of the DPS meter.
---
Most people farm things like Demonic Runes to complement themselves and to give that extra oomph, but to play an Elemental Shaman or something and having to farm those for 10 hours a day just to still go oom and do crappy damage while spamming 1 button  sounds pretty tedious to me.
---
Meme specs aren't called meme specs only because they're bad, they're actually not fun at all to play either. The people who play those meme specs are usually ones who like to identify as special snowflakes and want to play something "unique" that no one else is playing, because if you compare these specs to another class in the same school of DPS you get way more reward out of those classes (which reward is another thing you mentioned) with way less work.
---
I can't believe there's a demographic of players larger than both 18-24 and veteran wow players wtf
---
I never once told you what to do, just that I do not personally get why you'd deliberately play with much less dedicated/worse players than yourself, just to be able to play ret.
---
I used to use eyes of the beast on my pet and solo deadmines...a lot.
---
Right?
---
5 hours to get to lvl 10 ? I would loose all my hair !
---
What you’ve written in four paragraphs can be summed up into one sentence:
---
“Bad game design”.
---
/who level 1 nightelf elwyn
---
Alright time to spend some gold 
---
In the healing department, yes.
---
&gt; how about mobility
---
Mobility as a healer doesn't matter in most situations. You can only use travel form in outdoor raids (so out of the 40 man raids, only AQ40), you can dash in cat form but the mana it costs to shift is hardly worth it. For pvp sure, it's great.
---
Yeah, I didn't realize that was coming too. 
---
Yep, pretty much this.
---
Telling people who have an intent to raid to play what they want is actually cancer. You're promoting their selfish vanity over the good of the group. 
---
Everything that i have said has been true and sincere, you make whatever you want from that. Some people never grow up and are "edgy" adults, so it's not only kids who want to get away with stuff. All i am saying is that Blizzard shouldn't be or mom or Big Brother. Restricting freedom of speech in a game ? Its a fucking game.
---
If you're offended it isn't my problem. Sometime the truth can be offensive. The difference is how you deal with that.
---

Don‘t discuss with NostalgiaSchmaltz it is senseless believe me I already had that discussion with him. He obviously is to pro to realise that people have different preferences and they intentionally choose nelf or human even if they „gimp“ (what a shit description btw) theirselves. He is that kinda player who goes raiding with 4 classes and 2 races because everything else is gimping and shit and „not fun“ in his perspective.
---
The NE is a druid though
---
Thanks for all the replies :)
---
Also the off tank spec was some variation of 31/5/15 because as arms you could do in tank gear, still do decent DPS in the excecute phase, and tank like a boss in an emergency.
---
Yeah
---
Kommer troligtvis missa nästan hela första året av classic så detta låter suveränt isåfall. 
---
Är det bara att skicka ett pm nu och kontakta dig på nytt för min guild inv sen?
---
Shotgun it on release
---
It's not a huge no no to dual wield fury while leveling a warrior, it's just that it might not be the most optimal way. But I'd rather make real tests on a Blizz server than rely on theory-crafting and pservers any day.
---
I tried dw fury while leveling my first warrior in Vanilla. I remember that it felt better than a 2 hander because you didn't have to wait almost 4s for something to happen. I have no idea if it was slower or faster, I took whatever best weapon I would find and adapt my gameplay to it.
---
Guy, you do those encounters every single week. And they are easy to fuck up and cause a pretty large wipe. It's not like one and done. Only and Nef will be some of the most farmed bosses in all of vanilla for the majority of guilds. 
---
Do all Horde races that play Priest have that or is it similar with Dwarves and Fear Ward?
---
Your individual performance, no.
---
Your raid performance, yes.
---
Fotm, more like flavor of the decade.
---
yes there is, just not in 1-6 range (in case of sharding i guess you'll be able to quest at 1-6 aswell), you just need to get abit ahead of the crowd and you can level normaly.
---
Interesting to see that Ulduar was originally a continent... Wonder how that was planned to work!
---
I would have loved for more of these zones to be used as Classic content instead of expansions. Kul'Tiras and Gilneas as new zones in Vanilla would have been amazing!
---
To be completelly honest, I would rather take release date end of summer so i can say proper farewells to my friends and loved ones
---
&gt;in tbc
---
&gt;tops dps meters in t6 content as BE ret and 1 shot shitters in pvp
---
Just macro plague to Inner Focus and its free.
---
Whats your point? Dwarf priest is objectively better. Just because a lot of guilds dont use dwarves doesnt change that.
---
I get the feeling that Priest racials were just thrown in haphazardly, since Priest is the only class that has them, and they're really unbalanced for the most part. By WOTLK they were removed almost entirely, with the surviving ones just made into baseline spells.
---
Too bad its Classic then :kappa:
---
I didn't despise anyone because I don't RP. I understood they were other people playing those characters and I never went out of my way to grief them because I'm not a twisted asshole.
---
Fuck me that'd been cool
---
&gt;that Rogue that always seems to die, comes bottom of all the Rogues on damage and is half-afk during raids to have an avenue to taking the best items from the people that actually perform
---
I wouldn't remain in a guild that allowed that either. But that should not be the case. That rogue should have their mistakes pointed out to them in a respectful manner. If they continue, then their behavior is intentional and they should be removed.
---
What I'm saying is that if a guild decides to bring a boomkin along for whatever reason, and that boomkin is contributing in earnest to the best of their spec's capacity, then they have as much claim to say, Netharion's Tear, as a mage.
---
If a raid doesn't want a particular individual in the group, then don't invite them. But don't pull some excuse to deny them loot after they contribute.
---
As far as passing on upgrades, just mainspec free roll them if nobody wants to bid.
---
It's roleplay. If not then you should probably seek treatment for your mental disorder
---
High health high damage adds without special mechanics is lazy game design. Wow has improved mechanically over time.
---
Classic is just a tank and spank dps race. There are few mechanics that force the dps or healers to adjust their play. The challenge in retail comes from interesting mechanics. Classics difficulty comes from limited resources. Which imo is artificial difficulty. It's just limiting the player for no good reason. 
---
Dark souls is a great analogy here. The Capra demon boss in 1 is artifical difficulty the boss itself isn't hard so they throw adds to artificially increase it's difficulty. Then compare this to pontiff sulyvahn. Pontiff is a relentless boss that requires you to think on your feet and always be reacting because he never gives you a chance to breathe and plan. Capra is Classic. Pontiff is retail.
---
I played to Cataclysm and quit because it was going downhill, and FAST. Simplification of talent trees, fast leveling, borderline retarded spec choices. Dailies that = Job simulator. I quit, and it has gotten WORSE since then.
---
I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say it was just a typo. He spelled it correctly in the post's body.
---
Especially Ony will be zero trouble once you cleared BWL. I mean, she is easy the second you go in there. What's your point? Dwarf priest is great, I'm admitting it all through this thread. Not every player has to be one. 
---
You absolutely should, the community is great, even on private servers!
---
On private servers, I'd pickpocket. The little boxes often had blue weapons that sold nicely on the AH
---
If you've played any MMO before, you won't have a problem learning WoW.  You don't need to worry about elitists, either  --  leveling from 1-60 is probably going to take upwards of ~200 hours for a new player (the world record is around 100).  It's a long haul, but not particularly "difficult."  If you make it to 60 and enjoy the game enough to want to take it seriously, there are *tons* of resources available to help you learn and play optimally.
---
My recommendation would be to give it a shot!  Play for ~20 hours or so and you'll start to get a feel for the game.  Odds are reasonable that by then, you'll know whether the game will have "hooked" you or not.
---
Also you have the benefit of something a lot of us here wish we could have -- truly experiencing WoW again with fresh eyes.  The game was meant for casual MMO players when it launched, you'll be fine.  Dive in and have fun!
---
There will be many many many new players. Don’t let this sub of the hardcore, dedicated make you think otherwise. Playing p server’s I encounter noobs all the time. Not to mention all the kids from retail who will come over to try the old school version who’ve never touched vanill wow 
---
You will find every type of player there is. From the ones who never reach lvl 60 to the ones playing 15h a day, without a doubt.
---
I’ve noticed that blizzard tends to release after their competition does. Like they released pandaria a month or so after gw2
---
Did you even read anything I wrote? I find it ironic that the so called defenders of a non-offensive society are often times the most offensive.
---
&gt; WoW is not a venue for discussing important political issues. 
---
Of course, WoW is first and foremost a game, but it is also an MMO, which entails talking to each other on various subjects. 
---
&gt; Is it not the letters section of a major newspaper, or a town hall meeting with your elected representative. 
---
I am not saying anything Blizzard has done is illegal, I am just saying it is not rational. The right to presumption of innocence is a thing you find in courts, because it is **logical.** Laws are logical additions to our way of life, a means to rectify mankind's irrational behavior. I don't want principles of the law in the game, because I like the shiny court room setting, but because they only serve to help rectify mankind's irrational conduct.
---
&gt; Importing rhetoric about free political speech to justify being unpleasant or offensive in a video game misses the entire point of free speech. Clue: Free speech was never about enabling you to make racist jokes in Barrens chat. 
---
That is precisely what it was about. Everyone knew at the time that freedom of speech would entail people being allowed to say things that would offend you, but they calculated that the upside is way better. Freedom of speech allows people to not be afraid of saying what they want, which can be beneficial, as some opinions definitely are. Freedom of speech is also impossible to regulate for what is offensive and deserves a mute differs from person to person, but more fundamentally, there is, as I have pointed out in my "Offensive the word has to much legitimacy.", nothing unusual of being offended. 
---
&gt; Nor do you have a right to be proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt before a jury of your peers while being defended by a publicly-funded lawyer before your racist, lying arse can be muted in a video game. It's a video game. You are not being imprisoned or fined. Get over it. 
---
Like I said, something that is irrational in its absolute sense is irrational in its relative sense. I am not a racist, I think a lot people would assume that what I said was just a joke and that nobody would actually make an issue of being allowed to be a black character in a game. As I said, I am worried about the strategic implications, I fully realize that just being muted is not a big deal in the overall scheme of things. 
---
&gt; WoW is a video game kids play. Play it as if there were kids in the room when you are in general chat, because there are.  
---
I think my point was just that it is hard to do and say things around kids that they would not find offensive.
---
I would submit to you that your post was offensive. You used various ad hominem attacks on me and I believe, if I understand you correctly, that I should be allowed to report you for offensive behaviour now. You could if you had said that in WoW, possibly be muted. Do you think that would be rational? I don't. I believe the same leniency you should afford me, I will definitely afford you. Remember, I am asking for neutrality.
---
Sounds like youve never heard of dkp penalties and performance bonuses
---
A nelf hunter from my first guild.
---
In dungeons if a mob ran to the healer, by the time I would reach it (I was the tank) he would have stunned it, sent his pet on it to the point that I would later become lazy and count on him to manage things. His pulls were precise, his pet always were it was supposed to be.
---
In PVP it's like he had a teleport : always unnoticed behind, doing massive damage.
---
Oh and he was the nicest guy, always ready to help.
---
When you think about hunters and vanilla you probably think huntard.
---
Me I think of this guy.
---
Cheers for the response :)
---
If you don't mind me asking, what are the specs on your laptop?
---
This. The most unique feature of "WoW", actually, was a feature of the people playing the game: to see it as a game and as a way to enjoy the game with other players. Without this constant "me, me, me, mentality"
---
Amen. I don't mind the hate, I have a fair few IRL friends who I will be playing with and potentially raid leading with so I don't mind, I was just curious, I still lean alliance after this discussion. Thanks for your input mate. Appreciate it.
---
&gt; Well this is some neatly typed out nonsense   
---
&gt; simple fact is you don’t act like a cock and you won’t get muted 
---
Are these two phrases meant to be contradictory? Good thing the automated report system is not on reddit

I miss wow. I was the first BiggyBig. 
---
\#Nochanges lookin fuckin gooooood
---
Omg can't believe I forgot about Happyminti. Another example of a very skilled OG rogue.
---
I though about a punishment for people who false report someone, but I think you kind of run into the same problem. What would constituted a false report and what would the penalty be?
---
Just go ret, the holy tree doesn't improve healing very much while leveling. You can start dipping holy after you reach the bottom of the ret tree. However your rotation and stat priorities will change to conserve mana for healing because paladin damage spells are extremely inefficient compared to their heals. Refresh rank 1 seal of command every thirty seconds, wear spirit/str gear, and heal your party when necessary. Preferably healing in bursts to maximize time regenerating mana.
---
Level cap is just a number, it doesn't matter if you're level 60 fighting level 63 bosses, or level 80 fighting level 83 ones.
---
IIRC the proc on Wrath of Cenarius is doesn't come often enough to be worth it. It's worse than other options.
---
Similar to D2/ES3, but better. There will be active users you can communicate with, in an actual world-sized world. Tauren Paladins and Gnome Priests.... someone should be shot.
---
Thanks for everyone’s replies! Def gonna give it a try this summer and I can’t wait.
---
You can say it's bad game design that some specs aren't as viable in PvE as others, but I don't see how it makes the game unfun to play. There's 9 different classes in the game and something for each role, if you can't find at least 1 that would be fun to play for you then I don't know what to say. 
---
Just because you can't play a Ret Paladin in PvE doesn't mean the rest of the game is completely unfun, there's way more good in the game and a few badly designed specs don't ruin it.
---
Also some of those meme specs are quite good in PvP so you can definitely have some fun with them in that setting. Elemental Shaman has probably the highest burst damage in the game, it just lacks longevity which makes it non viable for long fights aka raiding. 
---
If you take a look in /r/wow and see what's up with the retail version as far as I can see literally everyone has been complaining about the game for the past couple of years and it seems like to most people this newest expansion has been incredibly disappointing, so talking about bad game design the retail game suffers from that probably even more so.
---
Ja, gjør det :)
---
And 75% durability hit. 
---
WCM, I remember checking that shit daily.
---
I'd argue against what you're saying though. Vurtne, Laintime, and Beckon are all examples of players that were leaps and bounds above videos like this. Grim wasn't the only one, there were tons of rogues that were carried by gear. I was one of them. I don't think that's a good or bad thing. Was simply saying that I'm not insanely hyped for just another rogue to play Classic.
---
Send meg en PM ;)
---
Honestly, when I'm playing a priest, I never ask the mage for water. Know why? BECAUSE THE MAGE WATER IS TYPICALLY ONE LEVEL BEHIND THE BEST WATER CURRENTLY USABLE. Yes, the stuff is free, but it provides less mana. And since far too many tanks are too impatient to wait for the priest to actually regain all their mana, I stick to the drink that provides as much mana as possible as rapidly as possible. And when playing a warlock, I also don't ask the mage for water. Reason? It's faster to life tap to regain all my mana and then slap a bandage on myself to regain my health. So once again, using the inferior mage water is a waste of time.
---
Quests have never been more than a chore. "Adventurer I need you to....." " Yea yea yea STFU and give me the quest so I can get my gold and xp"
---
Simplification can be a good thing. For example. Look at Path of exiles tree. Fuck that. I still don't really understand it. It's absurd. Wows talents are definitely on the simple end, but being able to change them on the fly allows for trying out new things. 
---
Fast leveling. You mean speeding up through garbage filler so you can actually play the end game content?
---
Every spec feels different and has a unique position. So I don't know what you mean by retarded spec choices. Priest (my main so I know it best) has 3 specs which are all very different. Shadow is the dps spec, discipline heals via damaging enemies after applying atonement. And holy is your classic healer. All play and feel vastly different.
---
You can heal every non-raid PvE encounter just fine as shadoweaving holy.
---
And you'll need to respec for PvP, anyways.
---
If you don't like playing a 'gimped spec' in raids, for the benefit of the team, may I recommend either not raiding, or BFA?
---
How is LC not a corrupt system. We did dkp back then and it worked great. This time around my and i will be playing together and hoping to raid but we are limited on time. My concern is if we're only alternates there isnt even a point in coming if no life's second set beats out our upgrades or wants. On the bis list alot of times tiersets arent even there so does LC determine this to be just fodder for their top performers to sit in capital cities with and never use while the inconsistently available parents stay in preraid forever. As someone without LC experience it has us worried unless one of us is blowing the GM neither of us will get to get any loot.
---
Did one and a full one. Its long AF but rewarding too.
---
Nah. It’s just the coolest/most hipster low-level area IMHO. 
---
A more legitimate, concrete point would be that since it’s on Kalimdor, there will be MUCH less competition for quests/mobs at the start.
---
Not wrong. My fondest memories of Vanilla were Tarren Mill/Darkshore wars. Didn't matter the time or day, you go down there, there is 10-50 toons a side just messing each other up. God help you if you try to do the yeti quest right there
---
Is the cast time for mounts in 1.12.1 3 seconds or did the 1.5 second change take place before this patch? Do you still need to keep the mount in your bags? 
---
Also, is there a good list of high level profession trainer locations? IIRC the ones in cities won't take you all the way to 300, right? 
---
The truth of this cannot be understated.
---
I have a crappy old laptop which can barely handle running an external monitor, but when I'm away from my desktop I'll still use an external with the laptop if it's available, just to have 2 screens, even if it's a shitty experience.
---
I know it was on a Pserver but my AQ guild still fucked up and wiped occasionally on Ony
---
Bowel prep for the grind
---
Rockfury is best for all vanilla and wrath isnt, so get rockfury.
---
There are flightmasters literally everywhere now. It's a total shame because nobody bumps into each other in the open world.
---
Yeah. Classic just isn’t for you. You come off as very entitled. Either you’re young, or mommy gave you everything when you were a kid. You want everything, and NOW. Just don’t play Classic. Everyone will be happier.
---
People say all kinds of stupid shit in every thread though. If someone says "Go dwarf or GTFO" please do downvote them to hell as it just not helpful to anyone.
---
There are some powerful race/class combos like human melees for pve or orcs for pvp, but they only affect your personal performance, even the most hardcore guilds will not turn you down because of your race if you can pull your weight. 
---
But with alliance priests your race has an impact on the whole raid. You can try to downplay the importance of it all you want, but most people will pick a dwarf over any other race 99% of the time, assuming equal skill. And that's true for hardcore, semi-hardcore, casual and w/e other types of guilds there are.
---
You can still get into guilds as NE and humans, even HC guilds, but you are at an actual disadvantage. And that's what people are trying to warn others about. 
---
It also uses a debuff slot, so you can't really use it in raids. This comparison isn't accurate at all.
---
Why avoid it? Having a fresh server is awesome and people should reroll to play there if they want.
---
Ahhh a betrayer, the worst of the worst...
---
Going zoom is not an issue? Wtf? I use 15 Major Mana Pots per raid....
---
And don’t comment it’s “just me”. 
---
I would find friends to mess with, or deliver guild info/decrees in character. We needed to convince a bunch of other guilds to help us against a coalition of Horde guilds, so I used my mage to appear out of invisibility to the leaders of the various rp-pvp guilds to initiate some roleplay.
---
Do we know what the recommended specs are for Classic? Will they be similar to Legion or will the lower poly count make the requirements lower?
---
I think we meant for the inevitable new start that will happen once classic servers begin to stagnate at the end. Like seasons, etc
---
There is also a Red (Scarlet Crusade) and green version. All look fantastic.
---
While it isn't the biggest difference in the world I think 27" is the perfect size for 1440P. UW is fine. 
---
[This is the monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZXZ3QBD/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) I would recommend though if you're looking to spend a pretty penny. 
---
That's probably turned into legit battery acid by now.
---
Could be worse, could put your class in your username and then change your mind.
---
If a mod could go ahead and change my name to "warriorwis" that would be great...

Do you really believe that a company would rather use a pirated flip-show that has massive gaps in it - gaps that were filled by mere guesswork - as basis for their product?
---
Even the people who ran the scam that went by the name nostalrius have openly admitted that the entire spellcast syntax for non-player entities is based on guesswork. They never had access to it.
---
2.4 hitboxes instead of the classic ones, the 2.0.1 rage normalization values because they don't have the old formula, loot tables based on 3rd party websites. Guesswork on roaming range and leash ranges  
---
The list goes on.
---
Everyone use Major Mana Pot. That's not the same as going oom. You just need enough regen that your mana last you to your next mana pot. Human spirit is not going to make a big difference.
---
yup, nerds clogging the system
---
People have been complaining about WoW since time immemorial, people will always bitch, like they have done back in Vanilla.
---
The also won the Super Bowl last year
---
I never made it to in game in wow, how do guild leaders get to divide up titles?
---
One of the most iconic weapon models in vanilla. It's not that bad, easy to pickup for a ret or enchance that wants to replace some 50dps blue. It's not like any warriors are going to be upset you took it.
---
I have kinda given up looking for decent MMO's these days. All seem to be lacking. Path of Exile sort of fits the bill, but it's not an MMO.
---
And don't forget Rexxar is there!!
---
Honestly, you and the other guy who mentioned Desolace have convinced me. Desolace gets my pick for most underrated. 
---
Depending on how many locks you have an Spriest can become essential.
---
Pretty much no instant gratification in game.  It makes you appreciate things more.
---
Loot council is great is the people on the council aren't corrupt and the process for deciding loot distribution is transparent.
---
I became a man on STV
---
I love duskwood
---
I remember the patch where they revamped mana usage. The argument Blizzard put forward was that running out of mana "was anti-fun". What bullshit.
---
If it is because you were feared, you either were positioned badly, were completely unlucky with breath, or couldn't be bothered to swap between tanks / your MT/OT to tank the fear duration with his bersi - Assuming there was no FW which I assume is the position you are coming from now.
---
Anyways, mistakes happen. Ony is objectively pretty easy; I suppose she wasn't tuned wrong, so maybe someone important played bad/wrong and it slipped through the eyes. 
---
He predicted that too =)
---
lol
---
Oh man, to funny, this one brings back some memories...
---
So back in the days of vanilla, I was a GM for the game and was roommates with another GM.  He was a real goofball type and one day he was asked the same question in which he gave the iconic answer, "Chuck Norris Dies"
---
This obviously got SS'd and was a thing on the WoW forums...  I didn't even know it was him till months later, I think after he wasn't working there anymore one of the other GMs on our shift was like yeah wasn't that funny when X said that?  and I was like, wait HE was the one who did that, I looked back and sure enough it was his GM name, I died.
---
I think while I leveled an alt I watched all 7 seasons of TrueBlood.  It was terrible and great all at the same time.  It's a good show to only half watch.
---
Hahahahah true despair is upon us
---
nah man, ppl like to teach other ppl it boosts their ego, cos they know something that someone doesnt. so just don't shy to ask and say you don't know something, be honest and straight and you have no problem with most ppl really. even something very basic.
---
Only type of noobs which are problematic that don't say they don't know something and act like they do, doing something stupid or refuse to learn and insist to do it how they do.
---
One of the reasons why Classic wow is something that every gamer needs to experience, cos it has a unique enviroment and the atmosphere. baseline gameplay is challenging, time consuming and all the struggle you are coming through, and other ppl know it aswell, you all coming through it together sort of, so everyone knows what is what,  and respect others more. so players are actually usually very supportive, than in most other games, and take their time to explain something to noobs or tolerate them.
---
personally i have no problem with a tank, that says in the beginning of the dungeon, "hi guys i never done it, where to go?" " or what should i do here, please guide me, i don't know".
---
Only ppl that ppl have problem is with ones that are nooby but don't tell anyone and act like they are. ppl that ask for advice, listen and do what told, are no problem at all.
---
Also there gonna be elitists, but they usually play with each other. there gonna be ton of new players for sure, por ppl that forgot everything. And most ppl gonna be average.
---
Ahh yes the "I can't more coherent argument with evidence so I fall back on insults" I was wondering when this way of thinking would rear it's ugly head.
---
And for the record I came from the hardcore shooter community (insurgency and the such) where everyone is on the same footing and it's about skill. Not arbitrary grinding. And for the most part retail is like that. I'm consistently pushing m+s above my ilevel because of skill. 
---
Bubble hearth.  The cowardly was for the bravest class.
---
When vanilla starts to stagnate 18+ months in I don't think the answer will be to release the exact same servers again. People will already have decked mains and multiple alts. Unless the project is put on on 'ice' by Blizzard (ie. HotS style maintenance mode) if they want people to keep playing it will have to be something new (or something old hint hint).
---
Im actually really excited. Ive never watched game of thrones so thats my leveling show. But i feel like it will end up being more distracting than not. I used to watched the simpsons and seinfeld when i played as well. So watching those will feel very nostalgic. 
---
Too dangerous to fly over Mulgore.  It's a warzone.

I'm more interested in what goes on in the HotAllies chat channel?
---
100 days for Rammstein 24/7 then
---
I have a second monitor. But playing it in the game is different. 
---
I still love peggle. I play it on steam all the time. 
---
You can enjoy beating other players in world PvP without thinking you're a wizard come back from the dead.
---
Oh yeah, a first watching of GoT is not suitable for multitasking.  You'll either get nothing done in game, or be very confused at what's going on in the show.  
---
I'm thinking of maybe doing Futurama this go around, they recently added all of them on Hulu.
---
In Wrath, Engineering was my favorite profession for fun and PvP but in Classic, most of the tools seem to be an equippable item (trinkets, rocket boots, that helmet with the charge).
---
Am I correct that, in order to use these items, I have to equip them pre-combat and wait 30 seconds? Doesn't that devalue them greatly as you have to unequip actual gear and that you can't change tools mid-combat? I know that Engineering is very strong but it just feels weird to me.
---
Lol, I couldn't believe it, it was seriously surreal when I realized my spells didn't cost mana. Like... Seriously, way to kill a huge amount of the experience. 
---
Out of curiosity, was it "just" mana that they did that with or do warriors always have rage and rogues always have energy, etc? 
---
It would be great if they brought these back.  It might be nostalgia but I remember both the Horde and Alliance versions being pretty good.
---
My guilds first nef kill as a priest I used 7 mana pots on that fight alone.
---
Sure, so I guess some people just prefer one over the other and what seems like tedious to one person might feel more rewarding to another.
---
Even though you could describe a lot of things in classic as arduous or tedious I don't think that's a negative thing. You have to put up with sometimes annoying stuff but when you make it past that you feel rewarded, and you realize that if another person wants to achieve what you have earned they also have to make it through that same experience which usually makes it feel more valuable to me at least.
---
If I know it takes X weeks to reach max level for example then getting there to me feels more rewarding because I know that everyone else has to put in that same effort to reach the same goal, and some people might quit on the way because they don't have it in them to make the grind.
---
Versus reaching max level in 1 week, it might feel more convenient but the fact that everyone else also gets the same reward for as little effort makes the end result feel less valuable.
---
So to me in video games especially if it's a multiplayer game, tedious or arduous experiences aren't a bad thing a lot of the time.
---
Scam? lol
---
Rumour says it's beginning of August. Which, to me, is too long. i guess Blizzard wants to grant players abit of sunlight before the grind starts.
---
Are there any caster drops?
---
 Pretty much no instant gratification in game. Because everything is harder to come around. You learn to appreciate things more.
---
&gt; so I used my mage to appear out of invisibility to the leaders of the various rp-pvp guilds to initiate some roleplay.
---
Haha thats some GM level shenanigans. I love it!

Sorry about your meme bro

Honestly if the guild has a website that is a major red flag to me.

It is discord all the way for me and luckily in my experience that is also the trend.
---
It seems to ring a bell, but I also couldn't say for certain. Sorry I can't be of more help.
---
It is fantastic.  But I think you can probably heal deadmines in grey/green items.  Having blues will make it have less downtime.
---
 Pretty much no instant gratification in game. Because everything is harder to come around, you learn to appreciate things more.

Like a loot council
---
I get chills still.
---
Also, how did i JUST realize that's sylvanas narrating?
---
I'm not sure about the 30s thing but for sure you can't change gear while in combat (except weapons).
---
It's a trade of : want speed ? Enjoy those lvl 30ish cloth boots instead of your epic plate boots.
---
Shit i never knew solitaire was in. I used to alt tab out and play majong (windows vista days) that was a blast. 
---
Yes it was definitely Wrath. I stopped playing once I realized I was logging on just to play peggle rather than actually playing wow. 
---
Boomer alert
---
Another great show to watch during leveling. And always sunny of course. 
---
I was 13 when i did nefarian in vanilla, so it was really cool going down memory lane when reading your post :D thanks for that! 
---
I have an old guild video of our first ever nefarian kill, and literally every person in the raid was jist screaming in their mics xD Ppl were so fkn happy to get that first kill, and that kinda has to mean it was actually fucking hard. And according to my hazy memory, it really was :p
---
Doing things efficiently instead of spending hours on something inferior is a good sign not a bad one.
---
I was a holy priest.  But herbalism/alchemy is always a good choice.  (It made me self sufficient in herbs and I made my own pots while most of my gold came from selling stacks of herbs. )
---
Amen to this.  People don't seem to realize that during Vanilla there were maybe 2 or 3 really hardcore guilds on each side on each server, out of maybe 5-6k unique players (1500-2k peak population).  So of 5k accounts, 2 or 300 hardcore players (150ish per faction), probably less.  Players may be more informed now, but they aren't more dedicated, and that was the true roadblock.  Pservers are a bad indicator not because of the encounters, but because of the population and the self-selected playerbase.  This means that honestly most guilds will take what they can get, and while this means that spriests and boomkins will raid... it also means that when one of the officers cousins rolls up a mage on your server, odds are good your boomkin goes bye bye.  It also means VTC will kill guilds still,  and that the higher tier guilds poaching your top talent because their 'lock caught a case of the RLs will kill more guilds still.  Unfortunately I don't think I'll have a way to see how this kind of drama plays out for all the people talking crap before the fact, but I have a feeling it would be sweet if we could.
---
I had a Rogue in Alliance when I first started playing when I was 12. I would sneak into Org and run RFC I would then sell the BoE greens that dropped on the auction house particularly a green shield would drop and people would pay around 10g for them because on the alliance side that was no easy shield drops until deadmines. Other then that I remember fondly being the “runner” to raise guild funds I would usually organize guild groups to run low level dungeons and people pay you for the run on a Friday and Saturday night you might make 1000g back when that was a unbelievable amount of gold!
---
I remember a SS with a GM ending the conversation with a Paladin with '...and may your bubble never burst'
---
There was only one boss in SM:Armory; [Herod](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=3975). It was a relatively length clear to get to him too.
---
His only drops were an Axe of questionable value (the proc did good DPS but it locked you in an animation that could get you killed), and strength mail.
---
He was part of the quest chain in SM so you could get people to do him ONCE usually. But that pack of people thins out pretty fast and rarely do people want to run it again because of how much time it took to do just one boss.
---
It did get you a bunch of rolls on relatively strong SM BoE loot though I guess?
---
&gt; If you really think about it
---
You're overthinking it
---
It will always be Sunken Temple, always. I used to charge people to take me because I knew the route.
---
I had a chess add on lol might have been tbc tho. 
---
Most of the buildings from WC3 wouldn't look good in WoW.  For the most part, they're not buildings.  A gryphon Aviary is just a big gryphon head?  Unless you mean in context and not actual design, and in that case I think we have some area or building that represents each WC3 building.  
---
Ancient of lore in Zanger.  
---
Voodoo lounge in Org.  
---
Gryphon aviary in hinterlands.  
---
Arcane tower mage tower in SW.  
---
beastiary.... I'm sure there's something in Org.
---
I've always found the clown armor endearing, because it reminds me of the wholesome, ragtag D&amp;D murderhobo experience where you're constantly changing and trading out side-grade equipment with weird positive/negative effects throughout your adventure.
---
You are welcome to enlighten me why a 6 second channel doesn't affect the 5 second rule.
---
Ret and Enh very similar and are both great in PvP as long as you don't pretend to be a warrior. A ret paladin's job in PvP is to cleanse everyone and put BoF on the warriors. An enh shaman's job in PvP is to purge everyone and drop appropriate totems. In either case you aren't doing the most damage, but you bring something else to the group. The damage output is similar and both specs have tools for survival or escape.
---
Most guilds will have an OT or a hunter swing nightfall, but I've heard enh shaman do take that spot occasionally. In general if you want to do DPS in raids as a healer class in vanilla you will have to join a casual guild.
---
ORRRRR... and just hear me out... ORRRR... you could just get a couple of dwarf priests and not worry about any of that!
---
So crazy! Right?!
---
whats a swg?
---
Not even the people who've wronged you?
---
?????????????
---
So warriors can solo tribute runs as well.
---
&gt; elitists  
---
I use word "idiot" instead.   
---
Don't worry about anything. Enjoy your journey in classic, no doubt you'll find nice people in game, because every activity requires actual communication with people, there is no automation or matchmaking in the game. Thus giving you chance to talk to people and get to know them. 
---
This is what I tried to do! Scattershot, feign/trap. Dungeons as a hunter are sooo fun with all the utility you get
---
They were probably pretty shite
---
&gt; tanky enough to farm
---
What? Is he aoe farming? Otherwise his regular pl8 gear should have enough stam/arm.
---
"You outlined funneling gear to a core group first, which is usually what happens in a corrupt LC scenario, so I'm curious why you actually find corruption to be an issue? "
---
It's am issue because of two main reasons. 
---
1. A corrupt loot council can and sometimes does switch who they're giving loot to for no valid reason. I agine the guild your in says "we're giving these top 3 warriors gear priority but then on week 8 of raiding they randomly five their buddy loot. Your statement asses that from.then in that same buddy will still get the loot. 
---
First even if that was true it's still setting back progress. Second we don't know what a corrupt loot council is gonna do. Maybe they pretend theyade an accident but really are just selling loot to pigs who join the guild the leave or something after gettimg what they wanted.
---
2. The other reason is trust and getting what you signed up for as well as hating that you wasted your time.
---
Loot council rewards what the GM and the rest of the council determines to be fair. For example the MT will always be heard first before anything else; because this helps the guild the most.  Loot council is usually pretty fair because it doesn't penalize people for missing 1 or 2 raids do to"life"
---
Grenades completely messed up the rock paper scissors meta of vanilla. A warrior could beat a frost mage with a well placed stun grenade, otherwise almost impossible for the warrior to win.
---
Loot council can certainly be a corrupt system if the people running it have the wrong priorities. The loot council that I was part of had multiple criteria when deciding how the loot should be distributed. We had very few problems or arguments in my couple of years using LC at a high level. 
---
Main tanks almost always got priority, upcoming raid bosses (you've already proven you could kill the boss you are looting, so we wanted to prepare as best as possible for upcoming bosses), relative size of upgrade from current gear to new loot between the players that wanted it, and performance/attendance were always part of the equation. 
---
A good loot council can actually benefit people that have lower attendance compared to DKP because someone could always outbid you on an item that you would die for if they decided the minor upgrade was worth it. 
---
There are many, many variations of LC and DKP, they all have pros and cons. If you trust the people you are raiding with, your loot council shouldn't be corrupt. 
---
&gt; Restricting freedom of speech in a game ? Its a fucking game.
---
Exactly, it's a game. Try yelling racial slurs in a soccer game or a cricket game and see what happens.
---
&gt; If you're offended it isn't my problem. 
---
If you're muted you aren't my problem.
---
Not happy with that? Sorry. Sometimes truth can be offensive. The difference is how you deal with that.
---
&gt; 8 of &gt;50 boss encounters significantly easier
---
Well, duuuuuh?
---
Unfortunately all rogue pve specs do horribly in pvp because you lack stealth talents which renders you useless in pvp. 
---
If I remember correctly the high level prof trainers are scattered throughout the world. I could be mistaking them for prof quest givers but I don't think so.
---
&gt; because any raidleader with a brain rather has people with skill and high attendance than that one fotm clown who rolled dwarf for easy raidspots
---
You're 100% right, but if they have a choice between a dwarf or human/NE priest of equal skill, I assure you, they will pick dwarf every time.
---
Just because there aren't enough highly skilled dwarf priests, doesn't change the fact that they're in higher demand than NE/human
---
I'm shocked how vastly different yours and my lifestyle are, especially considering the fact that we're both Europeans.
---
They usually just take it for themselves and then their best friend if they get that far.
---
If you want to push end game raiding, herbalism is really good. You will save gold on flasks and you only need to know an alchemist to craft them for you.
---
You could go herb/tailoring or herb/enchanting with zero conflict 
---
Yeah, endless armoured mounts suck, dragons everywhere do literally nothing but makes you remember you are playing a game and it is just graphics not a living world.
---
With how bad modern GMs are I can't say it is that much of a loss. It feels like I am on a tech support call to India with flow charts, refusal to help, copy pasted messages, and their inability to understand what I need help with due to a language barrier. I would rather wait an extra 12-24 hours per page and get someone who understands and can actually help. 
---
On private servers people who roll a human or night elf priest are bullied and ridiculed. 
---
"You can post memes instantiously"
---
Disgusting
---
All energy systems were reworked/buffed. Hunters no longer had mana for example and were changed to focus, which only took a few seconds to refill entirely. It also made huge amounts of consumables and profession items worthless, because you just didn't need them.
---
Yeah! fuck roleplayers in any game!
---
Sexy White Girl?
---
There's nothing "Inferior" about a well-designed website.  It shows quite a bit about the people who designed it, and what their actual motives are.
---
Whereas almost all these discords will just be generic bots, and see very little actual customization.
---
I agree.  It makes no sense to RP an Orc while a Dwarf stands around next to you without you killing him.
---
Outside of Nature's Swiftness every 3 minutes, you're kinda screwed by interrupts.  You might say the same of any healer, but pallies can bubble/stun, druids can easily kite and have HoTs/NS as well.  Priests have shield, fear, renew, some have Desperate Prayer, and even Holy Nova while being inefficient is an instant heal.  If I had any melee on me I'd be interrupted on my first or second heal and dead during the spell lock without a good ability to kite.  Frost shock is nice, but they have plenty of ways to deal with it at 60.
---
Basically I feel like resto shaman is played the exact same in pvp as pve.  Stand in the back and hope nobody notices you while you drop totems and heal with the occasional interrupt/purge.  Even though this part of it isn't nearly as fun since chain heal isn't all that great outside of AV(although it is amazing in AV). The best things about shaman in pvp can be done by any shaman. Shit, their best pvp heal is Lesser Healing Wave and it's fairly strong for all 3 specs because it's got a decent base.
---
In the right situation, you can be awesome, but most of the time against decent players.. You're screwed.
---
Thank you
---
Yup that's how it works. It's most classes can drop combat in a fight if they want to either with a spell or just CC and wait the time out.
---
Hahah this was me. I had a 19 rogue, 29 warrior (fucking king), and 49 rogue when my main was a hunter that literally never reached level cap
---
"And it stops some Paladin or Hunter from stockpiling DKP to snag Thunderfury instead of a Main Tank."
---
My guilds master looter and just ignored rolls so people couldn't ninja, them they had DKP but certain items weren't eligible for certain classes even though the game would let them wield those items. 
---
I don't really consider that loot council butayne it is....?
---
I think Ulduar was supposed to be where all the high level stuff was. If you think about it: Silithus, Tanaris, Un'Goro, Feralas - they all have a common theme that is vastly different from the rest of Kalimdor.
---
There never really was a time when hunter DPS wasnt good. It's super good early then later other classes catch up but it's not a matter of them becoming obsolete
---
&gt; There are some powerful race/class combos like human melees for pve or orcs for pvp, but they only affect your personal performance, even the most hardcore guilds will not turn you down because of your race if you can pull your weight.
---
That's disingenuous. An Alliance Tank absolutely is expected to be Human, because the new PS Meta is TPS. Therefore, doing less TPS brings down the whole raid. Similarily, a sword rogue / fury war is "expected" to be human to shorten duration time of an encounter, increasing likelyhood that healer's &amp; tanks won't have problems and noone fucks up.
---
The same is applied to the dwarf racial, with the only difference that the dwarf racial has a bigger impact. Now while it has the bigger impact, it's usage in PvE boils down to a few select encounters. Absolutely incredible still and I wholeheartedly agree, as said multiple times, but still a few select encounters. 
---
&gt; but you are at an actual disadvantage. And that's what people are trying to warn others about.
---
The warning is absolutely fine and I think even fair. But, I mean, this thread already has examples that show the opinion that Dwarf is the only logical choice and reason how you are a detriment to your raid and only put your enjoyment on the forefront for picking something else. Even the notion of that is ridiculous, I'm sorry. And concerning your 99% figure: I am pretty sure that every guild is happy when they have 1 or 2 dwarfs(for cycling if the tanks aren't good enough). Anything more and its only saving seconds of fights. Healers will keep being rare as in every iteration of WoW. Noone will have any realistic trouble finding any raid as NE/Human and proposing that is even more disingenuous. If you want to warn someone, it's fair to warn them about the last spot potentially going to a dwarf because the raid is missing one.
---
&gt; If someone says "Go dwarf or GTFO" please do downvote them to hell as it just not helpful to anyone.
---
That type of thinking would have been gone at least a year ago if it would work :(
---
1. Speed runs are a thing
---
2. Noone is forcing anyone to do anything
---
3. A lot of people enjoy trying to play as optimally as possible
---
Everyone absolutely hated clown gear back then.
---
This is amazing cuz I built a pc with those exact parts back in August, knowing I would sacrifice every other game for classic come release!
---
Needing to download a spy (Discord) app to use voice is a major red flag for me.
---
I'm hoping we get a new expansion for levels 60-70 that keeps the important parts of vanilla wow but includes modern features and better balance and scaling.
---
Horde gets tremor totem, alliance gets dwarf priest. You're fucking yourself in the ass by not being a dwarf.
---
Hunters were always popular at 60. They always did pretty good damage. I'm not too sure where this info about them doing mediocre damage comes from.
---
You have to understand that DPS in vanilla is very dependent on a classes ability to reduce its threat, and hunters had the ability to drop all threat and start at 0.
---
I know, thinking outside the box is difficult for some
---
it could also be maiev shadowsong, same voice I think...
---
The change basically happened because our role in the world changed. By the time of KT's demise the adventurers are supposed to be greatly renowned, to the point where the Faction Champions in ToC and the Gunship Battle in ICC are both intended to represent the other faction's adventurers.
---
It's a natural problem that overly long RPGs have to deal with, and MMORPGs universally fall into that category.
---
Well yeah I do follow a code. Take my quest mobs, gank. Kill a fellow ally near me, gank. Going for the same gathering mode, gank. But I never go out of my way to troll or grief someone for no reason.
---
Azshara*
---
&gt; Did you even read anything I wrote? 
---
I doubt anyone read all of it. I skimmed it. It was all very pretentious and relied on the fundamental category error of thinking "free speech" in MMORPG chat is a political freedom worth sacrificing all other concerns for.
---
It is not. WoW is an all-ages play centre with a lot of kids running around, not an undergraduate philosophy tutorial or a lounge room at an adult party.
---
&gt; Of course, WoW is first and foremost a game, but it is also an MMO, which entails talking to each other on various subjects.
---
Incorrect. It entails talking to each other about the game.
---
&gt; I am not saying anything Blizzard has done is illegal, I am just saying it is not rational.
---
It is completely rational. Because this is not the town square, it's a playground with swings for the big kids as well as the little kids.
---
&gt; The right to presumption of innocence is a thing you find in courts, because it is logical.
---
And nowhere else because it is a pain in the butt. If the lifeguard at the pool or the referee at a soccer game blows the whistle and gives you a penalty you aren't entitled to a court-appointed lawyer, a five day hearing and a jury selected procedurally from a one hundred and fifty person jury pool to ensure they are unbiased. You take the penalty and you get on with the goddamn game.
---
&gt; That is precisely what it was about. 
---
Found the person who learned about history from patriotic cartoons.
---
&gt; I am not a racist, I think a lot people would assume that what I said was just a joke and that nobody would actually make an issue of being allowed to be a black character in a game. 
---
I think you will find that in a world where right-wing extremists are carrying out actual terrorist killings, "ha ha I am being racist it is funny because nobody would really be racist ha ha" is not a very clever form of comedy to try in an all-ages venue.
---
&gt; I think my point was just that it is hard to do and say things around kids that they would not find offensive.
---
Everyone else seems to manage it just fine. So the problem is you.
---
&gt; I would submit to you that your post was offensive.
---
Today you have learned that a statement can be acceptable in one forum but not in another forum. Well done! Tomorrow we will move on to another adult concept called "bathing".
---
Thank you :-)
---
It's a shaman totem. They drop it and it removes fear, and every 3(?) seconds afterwards. Usually a bit shakey in application and makes the tank be feared for 0,5-1,5secs.
---
Can I get an Osrs addon? Plz Jagex.
---
and now ur inner fire is gone while trolls still have it as a backup.
---
So LC pugged in people are wasting their time?
---
If you look at the mmorpgs have done this already, this is exactly what they've done. Also, blizzard promised players they would have clsssic to play always. If people miss out on the experience, not really fair to them. Redoing classic vanilla over and over is the only logical solution and there's really no downside to it
---
Is that ESO Elsweyr?
---
No skilled priest in his right mind will roll a useless human or nelf. Dwarf is godlike in both pve and pvp so why would this skilled person even think about playing a human or nelf. 
---
If undead get to be undead, I will be rolling pally:)
---
Skinning was always a good money maker. Mining and skinning will be the best cashflow especially off the start when everyone and their dog will need materials for resist gear.
---
I had Herod's shoulder for so fucking long.
---
hey you might be on to something
---
Am I having a stroke? The above picture isn't BfA, it's the Tier 9 shaman set from Wrath, so it isn't leveling gear, and on top of that it's the Alliance set that would never find its way on an orc. Literally everything is wrong here.
---
Memory may be a bit blurry here but Ive read somewhere that Jaedenar was supposed to be some kind of a dungeon.They scrapped the idea for whatever reason.
---
I could catch so many sharks or cut redwoods.All the 99s
---
Those first grey shoulders and helmet. Those felt like purple to anyone
---
&gt; they had DKP but certain items weren't eligible for certain classes even though the game would let them wield those items.
---
That is literally DKP with Loot Council oversight  =]
---
What do you mean? You didnt want to do archeology while you waited for raids to start? /s
---
The channel puts a debuff on the boss... its unusable in raids. 
---
&gt; No one can escape you. With travel form, bear charge, sprint in cat form and roots. Remember in vanilla you cans shape shift out of anything but stun or fear. No one can cc you and get away.
---
Not quite. You also can't shift out of freezing traps or disorients like blind. I think if another druid sleeps you in forms you stay sleeped as well. I'm not 100% sure on that tho.
---
I will agree that a good druid will always be able to pick their battles.
---
I always cringe when people act like this about gnomes and dwarves smh
---
they just say that because somebody said it to
---
them, and they believe there is a right way to play the game regardless of preference or intentions 
---
I need a reminder addon. "STAND UP AND STRETCH" "DRINK WATER" "GO TO BED SOON" Would be helpful. 
---
How can he kill you in Mulgore ? it's a starting zone friendly players are not flagged PVP inside to avoid ganking.
---
Didn't you try to hit him first then got flagged ? :p
---
That would be AWESOME, but I’d advise against that.
---
Farming consumables actually sounds like an awesome way to earn some DKP. May incorporate that into our system :)
---
You turncoat !
---
For me, this is a perfect scenario! I don't really play that much games anymore, and my hardware can't keep up like it used to, performance wise. I also use Linux exclusively these days. Basically, Classic is the first game I'll properly play in years. And I'm quite certain WoW runs decently with Wine (from what I've heard). So for me, this is absolutely ideal.
---
I never cared. I guess I could be the only one, but mismatched gear aesthetics didn’t matter to me at all.
---
What was cool was finally getting matching pieces. It was like a visual indicator that your character was getting stronger.
---
I'd argue shamans are fighting mages. Also it's hard to think of what race would fit them without overstepping lore boundaries; humans I guess?
---
I still can't understand why they try to make shitty sets that no one will like. If you want a " set ", you have transmog. Just create some unique looking item, even if you have to bring back some of them from few expansions ago and recolor them. The orc from vanilla look so much better than the retail one. 
---
It's part of what made Vanilla great. Sure, nobody like to look like a clown, but it's the games way of telling you and people around you that *you "look like trash because you are trash! You want maching gear? We'll revisit the issue if/when you reach lvl 60".* 
---
i7 7700HQ / 16gb / GTX 1060
---
Sorry, but I have to call you out on this one. BWL adds exactly one melee +hit item, Drake Fang Talisman. Unless you think that the trinket singlehandedly makes fury warriors viable, you're wrong.
---
Implying that it wasn't to begin with? 
---
Don’t expect a beta I’m not sure why so many people expect it, Ion has gone through this, sure he left it as a possibility but he said it is very unlikely 
---
It’s prob evaporated by now
---
Rumors from who? Pessimists?
---
Ehh. Loving classic but gonna miss my warlock tier 3.
---
[The classic song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s7x2U-ro8p8)
---
&gt; Regarding toxicity, I refer you to my section on "Offensive the word, has too much legitimacy", just replace offensive with toxic.
---
This is merely an attempt to waste people's time with word games.
---
"Offensive" and "toxic" and "inappropriate" are absolutely fine as general terms encompassing all the different kinds of horrible behaviour gamers always get up to on totally unmoderated forums.
---
This disingenuous insistence that every criticism of bad behaviour in general specify in detail exactly what all the bad behaviour is and exactly why it is bad in each individual case is not based on a sincere belief that doing so is important.
---
If you want to have an in-depth discussion of why your racist jokes were bad then there is probably a forum for that, but this is not it. And I am sure it would turn out that there is an essay-length explanation of why it is bad that holds together, but I am equally sure you would not want to accept it.
---
That's about what I have. Ah well. I'll just turn the settings down a notch or two.
---
bonus info, it was a female dwarf priest with the pony tails hair that looked hilarious when casting spells :)
---
Looks like you just want to bitch about Loot Councils and purposely ignored their point. I don't see how you could read "benefit people that have lower attendance" as "pugging in people to waste their time". 
---
LC can be abused by people at the top. DKP can be abused by people at the bottom that just show up and underperform. Both systems can be abused if you have assholes in the guild. Find a guild that's not shit and you'll be fine.
---
Best of both worlds get a 34 inch and then a second smaller screen for bs :p
---
That's what makes it great. Currently, you have F2P games make armor look like absolute shit and offer cosmetic microtransaction armor to make people want to spend money. Back in classic, what you see was what they had. You respected people who had tier pieces because you knew what it took to get those items. 
---
If everyone who's playing has this epic looking armor, nobody stands out.
---
It's 10 mins and 25% durability. The sickness wears off by the time you fly to a different questing zone
---
I always played a tank so I just spammed "geared tank for any dungeon, 50g paid before." And I'd usually get instant invites and quick clears. 
---
This amount of knowledge dropped on a drake meme post is why I love this subreddit.
---
I'm not sure if this is a joke by OP and no one gets it or what but Holy paladin is that bad photoshop. give us the original picture if this is real OP haha
---
TBH you only need 1 tranq for AQ40 and no tranqs in Naxx, but guilds still bring along hunters because of their utility/buffs and because hunters are still okay DPS later on, just not as good as other classes.
---
A lot of design decisions in vanilla came from a lack of time sadly, had their budget been larger and had they had more time we would’ve seen a drastically different game 
---
Stupid thing to say. As guilds get better it becomes about clear time, that is directly correlated to mana regen and dps. Dwarf is still the superior priest, but once you have so many it doesn’t benefit the raid anymore.
---
I think you misunderstood the point I was trying to make. In vanilla WoW, while leveling, you looked like a clown and there was nothing you could do about it. After transmog was implemented, you can look epic while leveling up. 
---
In regards to gear, I litteraly picked the first and best looking set I could find without too much consideration to when it was added. I have no first hand experience of WoW beyond TBC, most of my information about the game is from friends who's still playing. 
---
Playing a game where everyone knows exactly what to do is more dull. Helping each other figure shit out is half the fun. You should definitely give it a go!
---
If you are trying to join a raid as 2 PUGs and there are 38 guild members, you are going to have a hard time getting loot unless you are paying for it regardless of system. 
---
I'm confused at what your intentions are. If the whole raid is a PUG, it shouldn't be loot council or DKP. 
---
If this subreddit is any indication there are going to be a lot of people rolling suboptimal builds in classic. This is totally fine in my opinion if that is really what it takes for them to enjoy te game.   
---
However, their choice doesn't make their build less optimal. If people weren't concerned about their  suboptimal build they wouldn't make so many threads about them.  Every build has tradeoffs and for some builds that tradeoff is maybe not getting into the most hardcore guilds or maybe being made fun off.  
---
Of course not all suboptimal builds are equally bad. A night elf priest is totally fine (just third choice) whereas a ret pally is not fine and thus will struggle a lot more.
---
Incidentally there were a lot of complaints on the forums from players rolling bad builds like ret pally. I'm kinda looking forward to that again.
---
&gt; I think it’s a bit unnesscarry for MC but I see the appeal of clearing MC really fast to
---
Ya people acting like it's 20 consumables + world buffs on every pull. That shit was legit only a thing halfway through AQ and in Naxx. Rest of the bosses were easy and the guilds that couldn't clear were 2 casual to care for min maxing consumables.
---
I'm not following part of this, or another comment above made by a warrior who had a rogue quit similarly over shoulder pads.   I haven't played in forever but I remember there was a need or greed system and you just hoped not too many people "needed" what you did. In end game raids does the loot all go to the group leader first?
---
Wait When did fury become better than arms? Anything ive missed?
---
I've been top dps in raids as ret pally most expacs. Just learn to play it properly 4head
---
Been using ultra wide for both retail and other servers in the past and it works great.  Looks really nice especially with settings cranked up.  
---
1.12 Hunter DPS parses are on par with Mages and Warlocks up until BWL.
---
Oh man right in the feels damn.....
---
&gt;The people who play those meme specs are usually ones who like to identify as special snowflakes and want to play something "unique" that no one else is playing, because if you compare these specs to another class in the same school of DPS you get way more reward out of those classes (which reward is another thing you mentioned) with way less work.
---
I wouldn't agree it's the thing 100%. Sometimes it's people who want to get geared for fun in PvP (like ench or ret wanting to get OP weapon) so they try to join as these specs so they would roll for em as "main spec".
---
Right having fun with your guild is bad.
---
You are out of touch with times old man.
---
Hate it when liquid evaporates straight through sealed aluminum.
---
I fucking knew it wasn't other white males like myself, that I was one of the only ones planning on rolling a rogue to gank
---
The leveling sets in BFA aren’t that bad. Some would even say they are all better than the Mail PVP and Uldir sets.
---
Archeology was added in Cataclysm...
---
This is perfect, thankyou!
---
&gt;Then why ever bring a rogue over a warrior? They are both amazing DPS classes but warriors parse a bit higher at every stage of the game.
---
Because doing good DPS invoves having good gear and it's much easier to gear a mix of warriors and rogues than just warriors.
---
Everyone forgets the zone south of Winterspring with the entrance to Hyjal.
---
We all hear about the barrens, Westfall. Duskwood, Redridge, STV, Hillsbrad, plaguelands and Un'goro.
---
But rarely anyone talks about that little nestled hide-away of demons next to Hyjal.
---
What item list are you looking at?
---
I mean im not the biggest fan of retail either but ur shitting on a version of the game you haven't played at all?
---
That's crazy and stupid. They just keep on taking out critical parts of the game. It's absurd.   
---
So do paladins never use mana or was that just a while-levelling thing? (Sorry to ask, I'm trying to google it but can't find the patch itself that changed this).
---
as you edited after I replied here is my reply to you. 
---
Do you know what Spec is short for? Specialization. the process of concentrating on and becoming expert in a particular subject or skill. Yea no shit you get locked out of the other talent trees. CAUSE YOU SPECIALIZED. and btw. This new system of talents. Its much more RPG like. If you have ever played D&amp;D you would know that in an RPG you specialize into a class. From there you specialize further. You dont get to dabble in everything. If you go Arcane school as a Sorcerer then congrats. Thats what you are. If you play a Dark Fire Adept. Congrats that ALL you get to do. WoW isnt an MMORPG. Its an MMO. Stop wrongly attributing the RPG tag to it.
---
and well. My assumptions have been proven correct. Classic WoW players have this "holier than thou" Mentality about classic wow and cant see the obvious glaring flaws that are the mechanical simplicity, and poor game design choices of Classic. 
---
And congratulations you finally gave 1 argument for why you think Retail is bad. But it was such a poor argument that I was able to completely tear it apart in 1 paragraph. What a tip? Read a dictionary. When you actually learn what words like specialization mean it will make your arguments much more sound.
---
I liked doing the lobster daily as a kid.
---
I remember playing my mage in redridge (like level 18?) and unwisely wandering into the burning steppes. I decided that I absolutely had to **map and discover the entire zone**. Being like 13 this just seemed like a fun thing to do. After a few hours and god knows how many corpse runs, I was done.
---
But hey, it came in handy to have the FP when I went there to actually level later lol.
---
&gt; once you have so many
---
How many is that?
---
Most guilds trying to do speed runs will try to bring as few healers as possible, only having 3-4 priests is fairly common.
---
Those zones are epic but I wouldn't exactly call them underrated. :) 
---
Exorcism adds like 50 DPS to your rotation if you can afford to cast it without reducing your max rank Consecration uptime.
---
Exorcism is a meme.
---
Ryzen 2700x and 1080ti here.  With 1.12 I get 7% and 5% in gpu and cpu utilization respectively
---
At first its a little depressing, but then you realize you can record, render, stream, etc with little slowdown.  I'm working on making videos for my first YouTube channel now so it's cool to be stressing my rig with things it was intended for.
---
&gt; and there was much less incentive to even use the internet for information in general
---
wat?
---
BWL boss drop table. Which +hit items other than DFT did you have in mind?
---
That kind of sentence is literally the same as promoting a way to play to other.
---
Just don't do it. For the sake of not influencing the others. Please.
---
Which is not what the vast majority of people were doing 
---
Depends on the type of Guild you're in, but if you're giving Boomkin's Naltharion's Tear then you're opening all kinds of strange doors.
---
BRE fort Ret Paladins over 2-h Furys, Brutality Blades or CHTs for Hunters over Rogues/Fury Warriors. Fuck it, lets throw in a melee Hunter too. He's trying hard and contributing, let him roll and Ashkandi and Thunderfury too. If you're going to give an item to an objectively worse spec, then why not let any spec into the raid at the point.  
---
If that's how you want to play the game, that genuinely doesn't bother me (why would it) and if you're having fun with it that's honestly great.  
---
Just don't pretend its the best way to give out loot based on performance and relative raid contribution. LC will always be better at that in theory, and theory is all we're talking about.  
---
The pvp ranking system is a complete design nightmare and many people will hate it. Should they change it? Not really. If people don't like it the correct choice is to not participate in the pvp system or to only participate casually.  
---
On private servers it is quite obvious that only a small fraction of the players actually care about ranking and a lot of other players barely participate.
---
If they change anything it should be something minor like lowering the decay rate, which will help both rankers and casual pvpers without reworking the whole system.
---
Unless you are a paladin, then you will look like a clown minmaxing the best pieces from all types of armor.
---
MP5 is constant regeneration, hence why it's called mana (regenerated) per 5 seconds. It's not the same as spirit mana regeneration which is called mana regen for short.
---
&gt;why a 6 second channel doesn't affect the 5 second rule
---
Channeled spells don't allow spirit based regeneration from the 5 second rule. You're still casting while you're channeling which is the main reason Shadow Priests go OOM so quickly, they can only benefit from MP5 because Mind Flay prevents spirit regeneration so they only have a short regen window during Mind Blast and Shadow Word: Pain casts.
---
Whoa whoa whoa, wait... what do you mean exactly? At lvl cap you get extra money from killing mobs instead of exp? I never knew this
---
Yeah he looked out of place so I attacked and missed with my fist. I hated human scum since 
---
The vast majority of people will be beginners. Ask advice from the people who are more experienced than you, and pass it on to other new people. 
---
I’d say, avoid popular streamers servers to lessen your chances of toxicity. Also, I think PVP servers are fun, but if you don’t like the possibility of being killed at any moment, whether fair or unfair, I’d roll on a PVE server.
---
But I played Vanilla back in 05 as a 7-8 year old, you will do fine. Just do every dungeon and explore every corner of the world, and meet/talk to people.
---
I bought a carry for 200-300g (can't remember how much exactly) back in 2005
---
I mean it was maybe a few silver. Dude's level 11 and during \~8 damage a throw after all.
---
Tips with those HUGE samples of 5-10 players per class, and of course less to none for offspecs to determine what's class dps in raid. Omegalul.
---
Ok, my mistake.
---
Cool idea with the Shaman skills. BL for Orcs, could be like 8 seconds of haste on a 30sec CD or something for a single target. Trolls get Hex. Tauren get Spirit Link.
---
I think they're talking about quests which reward gold and XP. At max level, you would get more gold but no XP.
---
Just a heads up skinning cannot make cured rugged hides. It requires 250 leatherworking to use a salt shaker that refines deeprock salt into refined deeprock salt on a 3 day cooldown. You can buy rugged hides on the AH and salt on the AH and make your own cured rugged hides (needed for MC crafting and Naxx tier 3 turn ins). 
---
The cured hide craft itself is not on cooldown. The refined salt you need for it is.

But aside from that, it's not just +hit that holds you back. It's having the required +hit as well as enough attack power and Crit.
---
The issue with fury is two fold. The exponential gains of attack power on bloodthirst and the exponential gains on rage generation resulting from white damage (attack power/Crit/hit)
---
When you hit the required stats for hit, ap, and crit.. you are then competitive with an arms DPS spec.
---
The bar is much lower for arms because you only need a few points of +hit with a two hander, and also because your main attack (mortal strike) is based off of weapon damage and not purely your attack power.
---
Can I use this post to ask what people actually mean by RP here, when they use it in context of RP-PVP? I've seen people mention it as a sort of...gameplay attitude, but as a roleplayer myself, people wouldn't stay in character if their RP can be interrupted by a random ganker.
---
RP in my experience usually involves around characters having social interaction in cities and such with each other, and occasionally having a DM event in which characters go off to battle enemies and such, used entirely in a /roll system similar to D&amp;D. There are RP-PVP events on roleplay servers, but they're really well organised and tend to have a lot of rulesets and planning involved, more than just "If you see a Horde person while leveling kill them."
---
Not trying to diss, I'm just a bit confused what people here think roleplay is. It sounds different from the RP I'm used to
---
Yo that guy was wrong, hunters have way more complex rotations than locks when you get to max level. Both level through pve content just as easily. Warlock you will have an easier time with in pvp for sure as a "noob" , the playstyle is way more about dumping your spells than choosing which ones to use at the right time. Using your fear spell is way easier to get out of pressure than anything the hunter has which is huge if you don't like being bullied

The learning curve for WoW isn't steep at all. If you've touched any MMO or single-player RPGs, you're probably already aware of the core concepts. The nuances will come with experience if you decide to dig into them. The biggest thing that most of us are interested in is the community, which I highly recommend you engage with. If you have questions, just type /1 (that's the general chat) and ask away. There are some jackasses because it's the internet, but for the most part people like to help.

I'm not complaining about a system I've not had experience with, and you've regurgitated what every other person says. Give a rundown of how the actual decision gets made or an example item drops then xyz happens. As i said my guild did dkp and sure you had the odd hoarder but it mostly hurt them in the longrun bidding super high on whatever they saved for while allowing upgrades to pass them while saving for whatever. I liked it because it was currency, if they wanted to be dumb and bid on bullshit they still got what they wanted and they had to work for the dkp to do so. To me it felt fair. Explain to me who hasnt experienced a normal everyday LC what it looks like. Dont regurgitate what 99% of people that never raided in vanilla say and provide nothing new.
---
I remember making my way to Goldshire for the first time and this warrior in Wrath Helm/Shoulders was sitting on the fence by the inn.  He /waved at me after it became apparent that I was new to the town and proceeded to show me around and explain the game a bit for me.

We want to raid but I doubt we'll be committed enough for core raider spots so i was wondering what our best hope was. Join dkp or lc or simply pug and pray. Dont have LC experience though to gage. Some guilds are already forming it makes us worried since our foot isnt in the door if LC would be bad for us.
---
Rogue PVP is some of the dullest things to watch, it's all surprise backstab 2-3 shots.
---
In organized raids, loot distribution is a lot harder... with maybe 3 things dropping from a boss, and anywhere between 10 and 20 people maybe wanting loot, need/greed just becomes a bit unscalable.  You wouldn't want a lucky Mage to be geared out the ass with your other Mages sucking wind behind him because they roll poorly, would you?
---
What most guilds do is implement some sort of system.  DKP is a point based system where you earn points for attending raids and helping kill bosses, and then you can spend those points to bid for loot.  Loot Council is a system in which guild leadership decides how to optimally spread loot among the guild, and perhaps rewards those who are exceptionally skilled or reliable.
---
There are lots of systems to choose from, but the goal is a fair distribution of loot rather than leaving it up to luck of the need/greed system.
---
Me too, that's what even reminded me of that event lol
---
Yes, do it.   Do it.
---
&gt; MP5 is a stat and isn't the same as mana regeneration based off of spirit.
---
Now that's semantics. I'm pretty sure every single reader knew what I was talking about. Especially when, as you say, MP5 is constantly active anyways, and the spirit (M)ana (p)er (5) second rule is the only that can be applied to that...
---
&gt; Channeled spells don't allow spirit based regeneration due to channeled spells being exempt from the 5 second rule. 
---
Got any sources for that? To my knowledge, the 5 second rule applies when you spend mana. Hence, the channeled spell immediately sets it in effect, and after 5 seconds channeling it activates again. 
---
&gt; You're still casting while you're channeling
---
You can start a 2-second heal at 3,1s of the second rule, making the cast finish at 5,1s. You get the mana from the 5 second rule. Here you are casting already at 3,1s though.
---
&gt; which is the main reason Shadow Priests go OOM so quickly, they can only benefit from MP5 because Mind Flay prevents spirit regeneration so they only have a short regen window during Mind Blast and Shadow Word: Pain casts.
---
Mind Flay is a 3 second channel. They would need to not do anything for 2 seconds everytime for the 5 second rule to become active.

How about an alternate timeline that introduces WoW2? Classic WoW mechanics and philosophy on a new engine that isn't 16 years old.

There is absolutely no issue with levelling as 2 pallies. Maybe not super quick but at least you won't die a lot. It should even work for dungeons.  
---
I'm just skeptical if you'll get your melee/tanking satisfaction out of pally as it can be quite limiting.

I'm not sure if I phrased it properly (I'm not a native speaker). I meant it was less of a habit to check things on the internet. This is something you can still see today among elderly people. When looking for information or content, our first reflexe nowadays is to just open our computer/phone and check it on Google. Back then, there was way less websites and generally information on the internet, as it was still relatively new to a wider public. 
---
I, for example, was vaguely aware of the fact there were WoW databases (Thotbot, WoWhead) with all items and loots listed, but would rather ask for info on the chat than go and check them on the internet. It would actually be one of the last things I would do. Hence, gameplay info was rare. There were some super niche class websites like the *The Warlock's Den* or such, but it wasn't well known. Internet wasn't used as casually as it is today, between others because it was less developped and ingrained in our everyday's life. Remember, there weren't even almost any Smartphones back in Vanilla times, IPhone 1 was launched in like late 2007 ... It was a different period, even when it comes to technology, and it affected gaming knowledge :)
---
The faction rivalry is what I miss most. I was really hoping BfA would revive it. RIP

Yeah that’s why i didn’t cheap out on my current monitor. 32” 1440 144hz, which is perfectly fine for every game except WoW. Ultrawides are so much better for WoW

---
1.) You'd have had to give something to Paladins to compensate for it being OP. Kevin Jordan talked about this on C2C I think
---
5.) Troll batriders are kinda in ZG.
---
8.) I think this is one of Vanilla's greatest strengths. It's not tied to anything that came before story-wise. Once Blizz started ramming story down our throats in TBC and Wrath, they pretty much fucked it up at every turn (Kael, Illidan, the Arthas story was well done but "there must always be a Lich King" was total garbage). Not having any investment in the characters means you can't be so disappointed when they ruin your favourite lore character.
---
At the end of the day, all the classes had to be somewhat balanced. Giving Mages water elementals and Invisibility would be ridiculous.

&gt; Do you really want to play a game where everyone is fake-nice
---
It is called polite society.
---
No one bubbles like Gaston.
---
&gt; I'm not sure if I phrased it properly (I'm not a native speaker).
---
You did phrase it correctly - the notion that in 2004-05 people weren't using the internet to learn stuff is absurd, absolutely absurd.
---
Depends on the content you are trying to clear, also depends on what the raid comp looks like. Some guilds roll melee heavy and need more healers than a caster heavy guild, casters start to take over end game while melee will steam roll earlier content. I personally only like 1 druid in raid and load priests for big heals ally side. I think healing will look different in classic due to the new api for addons. 
---
&gt; I am just saying that it is not rational for them to do what they are currently doing.
---
Is it rational to write an essay-length post whining about how you got banned for racism under the pseudonym "Nickerballs"?
---
Basically what you want is horizontal progression instead of vertical. And it's also the classic version I hope will happen and the only one that would guarantee classic survival.
---
The other options  are:
---
Moving ahead to the TBC era which means classic dies (obviously)
---
Staying with no changes after Naxx, leaving it in an eternal limbo which means classic slowly but surely dies on its own (unless they do frequent new servers but still, its lame)
---
Back then I was 12 so yeah.. not anymore
---
As far as I'm concerned, the next few months are fair game on this sub. I'm sure you'll get some hate, but good job for trying, brother.

Yea exactly.

This is what OSRS does to avoid power creep. All the new gear/content that comes out just has niche uses. Allows the game to live on without leaving anyone in the dust or sacrificing its original mindset
---
The Wetlands.  Especially the quests that take you into an excavation site filled with dinosaurs iirc.  The atmosphere is gloomy but beautiful.  
---
There will be one max per raid
---
It may not seem like a huge gap because the #s are so low, but it is.
---
A couple points of main stat here and there made a huge difference, and a % of secondary stat made even more difference.
---
But he's getting information from friends who still play :)
---
Did you use the Internet in 2004? You did not have search engines with algorithms that instantly found exactly what you were looking for, and you did not have anywhere near the information sharing we have today.
---
It was absolutely not the norm that everyone looked up all the information they needed party because people were not used to the Internet the same way we are today. It was a completely different time.
---
I remember my first steps in vanilla, and it were quite a few. I came in the game with not a single clue to do. I didn't even knew what a quest was. So I started running as a level one human paladin and ended up in Lakeshire. There I came across someone who asked what I was doing there and he gave me a 5 minute tutorial/explanation what I had to do and he gave me some silver, not even gold. The good old times... And a while ago someone posted a link to a site where you can see your progress of all characters you had and the time it took me to get to 60... It showed me that I hadn't got a clue for a whole while through vanilla...
---
Priest or Paladin are your only choices if you want to be a main healer in PvP. Of the two, Paladins are the only ones who can actually handle pressure.
---
Druids and Shaman are secondary healers in PvP. Druids can throw out surprise heals from stealth before the other team has a chance to react, but they will also tank hits in Bear Form and deal damage just as often as they heal. Shaman primarily deal damage and Purge - healing is a last resort for them. Lesser Healing Wave cost a ton of mana and doesn't heal for very much compared to other healers.
---
Because the People who want classic WoW cant make a real argument from a gameplay perspective on why they believe it was better. Its always intangible things like "Community". I have yet to see a true argument with examples of what they think (gameplay wise) was better about classic.  
---
Everyone I've tried to have this argument with has made statements and considered them arguments. Like If you are going to say Leveling was an enjoyable experience. Give reasons. Give examples. Contrast this with Retail and use detailed explanations.
---
 But this is r/classicwow Its a circle jerk of making a statement and everyone saying "yes. Thats a good argument." "Yea give Retail the what for." "Yea you are right." 
---
That's why I said that ease is a relative term. Even the first time my guild beat Nefarian (on a pserver), it wasn't nearly as difficult for me, an individual player, as some of the encounters in 10 man normal ulduar or throne of thunder in later xpacs. That's because we had an exceptional group of leaders that explained our responsibilities and held the raid to certain gear, spec, and consumable standards.
---
Best use of Starshards is for runners.  That's about it. 
---
I'm still rolling NE Priest though.  :)
---
Well, Vurtne/Laintime/Beckon being better does not mean Grim wasn't very good either :) It's comparing the top 1% with the top 0.1%. 
---
Then again, the best players rarely fraps their gameplay. There were Vurtnes on each and every PvP server, actually as far as I remember he wasn't even considered the best mage on his own server (Sylvanas EU, which was low pop back then). 
---
This was kinda proved at the end of WotLK with the AT server where all world's top PvPers played on. In the end, outside of guys like Hydra who managed to snag the R1, most of the top dogs of WCM like Reckful ended up stuck at 2k4 rating and getting farmed by completely savage noname players who never did a single video nor participated to any Bli² tournament.
---
If we keep comparing up and up, then Grim sure that good, sure. But compared to 99% of the players back then, he was great. Let's not forget how bad retail Vanilla players were :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C7Uvt\_0oYs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C7Uvt_0oYs)  (best quality retail Vanilla footage I've seen in my life, and comical on top of it :P )

You're forgetting that your lose your buffs/hardwork due to dying on a trash pull 5 min into the raid and/or dying to a pvp raid in BRM.

You're pitiful by thinking you know better than others like this.
---
Never played pservers. Began on EU in early 2005. Stopped at WotLK.
---
Hopefully for you one day you'll understand how to make proper and meaningful statistics and understand how guys like tipsout are just making people think whatever they believe.
---
Same. I was going to watch for 20 seconds and spent an hour watching him eat and drink old food.
---
Grim was playing so much better than most of the other players back then. His playstyle was absolutely unique and he took advantages of his class to improve his playstyle even more.
---
He knew everything about his class and how to avoid mechanics used by others and countered them. Grim was in my opinion by far the best rogue player back then, simply because he understood what he was doing instead of mashing buttons. 
---
I already got my G11 ready. Too bad its rubber dome and im used to mechanical ones nowadays :(
---
Because a lot of players enjoy pushing their DPS and getting good logs on legacyplayers. I dont understand why thats so hard to grasp. If you dont enjoy playing like that then join a guild that dont use consumables.
---
The more hardcore players will naturally flock together and push each others to use all the consumes they can. Especially on farm raids when you can get good logs.
---
Hell, we have had mages show up to BWL using the Blessing of Blackfathom buff from Blackfathom Deeps for the +15 frost damage and rogues with Flask of Supreme power and Shadow Oil on weapons instead of poisons. It's a lot of fun seeing what kind of crazy shit people come up with when they try to push meters.
---
I love how you get downvoted for this. It can be difficult to communicate between factions, but if I'm getting camped, that dude used his engineering to construct a giant billboard for me that says "I'm providing you with an opportunity to go smoke a bowl". 
---
If we're dick wagging (totally irrelevant but you brought it up because I gave you guff over your twitch maymays), I was playing vanilla day one, raided up to 4H on Alliance.
---
I'm sure your feelings are worth more than the actual statistics I provided. Show me the ones you're using, please. I would LOVE to see the massive amount of evidence you, 100% by accident, failed to provide originally. I look forward to being proven wrong by proper and meaningful statistics!
---
The numbers are literally lower than what you can get from using consumables.
---
Yes, I can see, if demand is there, they'll offer free migration, some realms will stay as vanilla permanently, and others move on to TBC.
---
So long as the choice is given, no one should complain really.
---
You are going to be behind the bleeding edge guilds, sure, but most of us are.
---
I believe there is going to be a large population that is similar to you when it comes to how much time you can commit, myself included. 
---
Best thing you can do is keep your eyes open for a server and build that fit your style as best as possible. 
---
can't please everyone!
---
We can only hope
---
Except that will fracture the player-base even *harder*.
---
I mean. So do people who defend classic. They use buzzwords/phrases like "a sense of community" or "Sense of Progression" or "impactful leveling"
---
So here are a few arguments for retail
---
Classic wow. Every boss was basically a tank and spank. Retail. The fucking adds in dungeons have more abilities than the bosses of classic.
---
Classic utilized archaic design choices of throwing a bunch of arbitrarily difficult poorly designed adds at the players vs fewer higher quality adds. Classic was Quantity, Retail is Quality.
---
"Questing was fun." ......lol? What makes a quest fun is agency. Classic WoW didn't have agency. (not saying that retail does either) Take Witcher 3 for an example. In many quests, there are multiple outcomes. So the decisions you make matter. Or D&amp;D where you are told to go kill this guy. Instead you can use diplomacy on his guards to get them to take you to him. Then diplomacy with the guy and help him instead. Its like using diplomacy to side with Van Cleaf and pillage the countryside for gold.
---
Classic WoW was archaic. Now if you like archaic more power to you, but lets be completely honest with ourselves here. from a mechanical standpoint. Retail is head and shoulders above classic.
---
Tauren totem weapons.
---
Thats the single biggest one for me.
---
Ye, playing with other people, like 'hi, where are ya from' and adding those people to your friends list if you liked playing with them. Hell, if you don't even liked playing with them because they were a bit *noobish*, and looking out for those people. There were really gratefull people about stuff like that.
---
You'll see....
---
From Classic to Wotlk I've kept a list of names of people that I can run dungeons with.
---
After the Dungeon Finder was included, everything broke down and nothing was really needed anymore, and it got worse with each expansion.
---
But soon Sniff's List will return, not related to Schindler's List.
---
The impact on existing servers is awful and a lot of dad players like myself want to see long term, stable servers. Fresh is the opposite if this and will ruin classic for many if it occurs 
---
I'd like to see Barrow Deeps and any other content planned for vanilla before the burning crusade came along, however I got to support no changes above all.

3/4 weeks is not 5.25 days. You can not ignore regions on official servers 
---
Nice build. Always thought of reckoning with retr.
---
You're pretty much always better off using Fear to avoid taking damage rather than trying to tank damage in a 1v1 situation. If you already Feared one target, and another target is in your face hitting you, AND both targets have DoTs on them - then it's probably better to cast Drain Life than Shadow Bolt. But if that situation happens, you're probably dead.
---
So its shit compared to tbc
---
Yea, migration is a bad idea.
---
Either expand or dont.
---
I tried to play ESO but even though I found the world fun to explore, the quests were extremely boring and unengaging. But necromancers do seem pretty sweet. Maybe I'll give it another try.
---
That's one of those things that's untraceable without some pretty advanced playstyle tracking metrics. Two people on the same physical PC, odds of getting caught are essentially 0. There are ways to sniff it out, but the amount of work that goes into that is just not worth it for them. 
---
Threadripper 2950 and Radeon VII. 
---
Yea it's viable. All you need is 5 points in fel concentration. You can do it as SM/ruin 30/0/21 or Nightfall/SL 20/31/0
---
I wouldn't mind them adding new dungeons after a bunch of people completed Naxx, but certainly not right after the first 1-10 guilds have done it.
---
What will I see? Are you predicting that the stats on items and consumables will be different in classic?
---
What is confusing about this set? Other than the fact that it exists and paladins can wear anything as any spec and do well.
---
WotF is very situational for PvP priests. Other Priests and Warlocks will almost never fear you, since they are buys fearing melees. Warriors will fear the others while trying to focus you down. Plague is on a huge CD and has limited value outside of 1on1s.

However shadow orbs and hex are very consistent spells, especially since hex is a curse and has maximum value at rank 1 and berserking saved me many times as a priest and can also be used as a tempo spell.
---
So we're talking situational advantages over conistent advantages. I personally favor troll over ud, but it is debatable.
---
&gt; 3/4 weeks is not 5.25 days 
---
If you read "3/4" as fraction instead of range the math checks out:  7d \* 3 / 4  = 5.25d
---
Does it actually work? In which order?
---
Depends on if my group of friends decides on alliance or horde. 
---
If horde, I'm thinking of a Tauren Protection warrior with hopes of being a main/off tank in a guild that raids once or twice a week for a few hours at a time. 
---
If alliance, I will play a healing Paladin of some sort. It is one of the only classes I haven't played. 
---
I played an undead holy priest in Vanilla in a guild that got multiple server firsts, including C'thun. It was amazing and I still have my priest on my account. I would recommend a priest to anyone if you are interested in healing. 
---
I also PvPed enough to get rank 11 so I could get the mounts. I farmed rune cloth forever to get exalted with the trolls. You bet your ass I hung out near the auction house as an undead riding a black war raptor. Playing PvP as a priest in Vanilla was also great, my best friend was an arms warrior, so we were a very deadly duo.
---
I can't explain it any further if you don't understand how much of a difference T1 and T2 is.
---
Consumables is a moot point because you will be using them regardless.
---
I'm thankful for this dynamic.
---
The 'crippled' healing you provide as a multispec shadow weaving priest is much more useful to a raid than the OOM-for-shit-dps of a true shadow priest.  That's the raid reality.
---
They made it 10% in TBC and it was somewhat good.
---
What a great story, thanks for sharing!
---
My first memory of WoW was asking for a group to RFC for quests and someone calling me a noob, so a level 60 undead rogue ran me for free.
---
You are free to try out different specs to try to find one that first your playstyle, but there's a reason why certain specs are popular
---
You aren't going to die just from 1 mob hitting you, especially if you have siphon life ticking on 2 mobs.
---
I've seen a guy in the warlock discord who says he levels with a drain tanking build by pulling 5 mobs at a time, putting siphon life on all and then using drain life.
---
I do think its more efficient to simply avoid taking damage by using VW or fear, but drain tanking is still viable.
---
Yeah, but then they just ended up making Fear Ward baseline anyway.
---
Probably had a lot of Priests race-changing to Human after that.
---
I'm just happy my ASUS laptop will be over-qualified. 
---
I would say almost 100% because of arena. IDK why people talk about Fear Ward regards to PvE where most of the value that you can make out of FW is in PvP.
---
In my opinion...Un'Goro Crater. Most people will be quick to hate this zone as there's only 1 neutral town, at the very north end of the zone, where both factions fly into and out of. It's a hot spot for world PvP and the corpse walk is BRUTAL.
---
But it's notable, to me, for several reasons:
---
1. Being a 48+ zone, it's typically the first zone where everyone will have mounts. This is usually the time when the folks that didn't plan or save properly can finally afford their mount.
---
2. The variety of flora and fauna is stunning. You have mountains, caves, swamps, marshes, a lake, a volcano and some underground pits. Within those locales you have big dinosaurs, little dinosaurs, gorillas, oozes and slimes, super mario flower monsters, fire elementals, tar creatures, insects, bugs and wasps.
---
3. The zone houses one of WoW's mini games...crystal hunter, for some niche buffs.
---
4. The zone houses one of the 4 demons that hunters need to track down and kill for their epic bow quest.
---
5. T-Rex lives here
---
6. It's a great zone to run the perimeter of for mining nodes, and run the interior of for high value herbs (think mats for greater mana pots, etc)
---
Damage return effects don’t reduce mob xp, that’s crazy. If you let something beat themselves to death you don’t get the kill credit, you need to active attack to tag them. Maybe that’s what you remember?
---
Why would you want to fuck around with stance dancing when you can just do something braindead like fear ward or tremor totem.
---
On numerous occasions. 
---
If you're playing on an established, progression, etc server, **you're not playing with the F R E S H type players in the first place.**
---
The people that leave for a fresh server are leveling up their 8th level 34 rogue, not your peers in BWL.
---
Depends what you mean by "fixed". 
---
Mostly because it's also really useful in PvE with so many trash mobs / bosses that fear. Having your tank be fear immune is pretty crucial.
---
Your realm is gonna be left for dead when that happens. That's exactly why there shouldn't be a new xpac. 
---
Fishing/pickpocket...it may not be 'omg i can sell this loot for 50g!' good, but its 'I just pp'ed for an hour and made a nice chunk of change' farming.
---
I never really had a problem with the new tier sets, I just had a problem with how easy LFR made them to get. Sure I could try harder and devote more time to get slightly better versions of the tier gear but the difference wasn’t epic enough for me. 
---
The average player looking so similar to the best players was a huge reason I stopped liking WOW around Cata, there was no feeling of diversity or unexplored territory because it was all so easy to access. 
---
Or we can do what he damn well pleases in whatever guild decides to take him with how he likes to plays. Jesus, I'm a hardcore min/maxer and even I don't try to shove my agenda down other's throats. It's pretty clear he has a plan for how he wants to go about things, let him worry about that.
---
But you need one spriest for the debuff to increase the lock's dps!
---
In vanilla I always had enough gold for anything I wanted or needed.
---
I'm talking PvP here. Yes, you can cast Siphon Life on 5 mobs and kill them all once you're geared up and grinding at max level.
---
An Acer Nitro 5 with an AMD RX 560x is just about the best you'll get at that price point. 
---
 Fishing/pickpocket...it may not be 'omg i can sell this loot for 50g!' good, but its 'I just pp'ed for an hour and made a nice chunk of change' farming... not to mention you can still herb/mine in dungeons for that bonus income. 
---
Nice! Thanks for the reply.
---
All players count as humanoids. AFAIK Undeads players used to be considered as Undead, but that was way too strong in PVP because you can't sheep/sap/fear/etc. Undeads.
---
Now, if we're talking forsaken NPCs, you'd have to go on a case-by-case basis.
---
Ah sorry, yea drain life is pretty much last resort in PvP.
---
I have no problem with this. Your video is informative and well done. Subbed!
---
I would use a DKP Loot council hybrid.
---
The separation is in the preparation
---
For most classes the raiding best in sloth -phase looks just the same as the leveling phase as well...
---
Pretty much. Not to say Warlocks are weak. You just have to actually use the rest of your toolkit in classic.
---
IIRC armor talent is pretty weak for the points invested. Better off with Shield Specialization and finish off Imp HoJ.
---
Thanks brother!

Nef is a great iconic vanilla fight.  Still fondly remember the first time my guild killed him back in 2006.
---
That being said, and this is nitpicky, but during the Warlock Class Call, Warlocks summon infernals not undead. The dead that raise during Phase 3 are the skeletons of all the dead Wyrmguards you killed in phase 1.   
---
Yes. You can go seal fate daggers or combat sword or fist pvp spec. They can easily be better than prep depending on the situation and gear level.
---
Why would that be a red flag?
---
I just remember in the PvP grind group on my server, we basically had a queue of who was getting Rank14 each week. I only made rank 10, but had the pleasure of joining the pre-made whenever I logged on. 
---
I guess technically it could be a tmog and a queue through the mercenary system?
---
No, you just had someone intercept/charge back in who was not in melee.  Honestly did you guys even raid this shit?
---
I played dwarf rogue in vanilla. Although I never excelled at anything, I enjoyed many different schools of the rogue. After they nerfed the stunlock (read diminishing returns) i did pvp with combat spec, and it was awesome. But in vanilla, no matter how you spec, you will almost always be strong against someone and weak against someone else. That can be a hard to swallow pill for some. 
---
Pretty sure it's still better to just sell herbs and buy ore for engineering 
---
Joke's on you, I used Inner Focus for a super dank Shadowguard, mon.
---
That video is hilarious.
---
I'm not saying Grim was bad at all. I'm simply saying that when I think of OG super skilled rogues, he isn't on my list.
---
If fileplanet (lol) still worked I had clips of my rog/lock 2s team 100-0ing Neilyo's druid (Hafu?) before he came out of stealth and taking 28 pts from him in ranked over and over. Counter comps and good players existed and they didn't care about making videos or posting on forums. So I think what you're saying just adds to my point, that there are so many other better players out there.
---
Haha thx i changed it \^\^
---
horde side generally lacks healers (lower pop of horde druids and shamans) whereas the alliance typically has lots of paladins (tons of cleanse from decursive) and more druids/hunters (more gravitas towards night elf).
---
ive had av's with no shamans and 10 paladins so it can be brutal to do dmg with dots.
---
It's less like whack-a-mole and threats while leveling feels legitimate, giving a certain level of satisfaction of getting out of hairy situations. 
---
There's \*some\* gameplay aspects I appreciate more in classic, but I think the flow of modern WoW is generally better and more satisfying (assuming you play something that isn't whack-a-mole). Homogeneity was a huge negative; classic has far more distinctive classes at the cost of convenience and balance in some  cases. 
---
Community is hardly an intangible, abstract category. Just because you can make a phrase grammatically correct doesn't mean what you say is right. Player interaction is at the core of MMO's, and thus community is by no means an intangible concern.  
---
I thought with 16 debuff slots a shadow priest is wanted/needed if stacking warlock dps?
---
My "Crazy Idea" is for them to just provide a rebalance of all the instanced content but it is all scaled to BiS gear. Also, it provides no new drops whatsoever. So once you have completed Naxx, you unlock the first rebalanced dungeon. So horde players would unlock "hardmode RFC" a 5 man dungeon that is scaled to assuming you have BiS Naxx gear. It still drops the same old RFC gear and items you could have got at level 15, but if you beat it, you can now try the next dungeon. Do this all the way through every single dungeon and raid all the way through Naxx. Provides a fun little system for hardcore PvE players to progress, without touching class balance or itemization in any way shape or form. 
---
I used to face off against happminti all the time!!
---
For everyone who played Classic when it was around, how long did the Ahn Qiraj war effort actually last? I gather it wasn't timegated and purely relied on the effort of the players on the server. What do think the average was time-wise for a server to open the gates?
---
Oh yeah. I havent played retail in a while. My bad. 
---
Omg another shit bad.
---
Go google when Crushing Blows were removed.  
---
Go google when parry haste was removed.  
---
Both were removed in Wrath.  Along with normalizing boss swing speed.
---
Keep being a shitter though.
---
Reminds me of how druids could solo the spider boss in lbrs 
---
Yeah it is rendered you can see Archimonde's skeleton too.
---
just be an OT
---
Yes. They're no considered Undead mob types (they can be feared, can't be Exercised by pali, etc)
---
Hey that's me
---
I dont remember, was so long ago, but it felt like a long time in my 15 year old brain
---
The time it takes to farm the shards a lot of the time takes less time then it would take for the other person to make their way to the dungeon. Nobody is more important but it saves everybody time in the long run. If you want to sit and wait at the entrance for 30minutes when you could've farmed shards and summoned him in 10 be my guest, but you'll look like an asshole.
---
3 seconds. You get used to it after a bit.
---
All profs are different. You can get to 225 in one of the major cities for most professions. Check the classic db.
---
I always thought Stonetalon Mountains was a nice zone, and I remember frequently pvping at low levels there. Super fun.
---
I need a simple answer, should I play rogue or warlock?
---
In vanilla I was pally main with lock alt. In BC/Wrath I was rogue main
---
Herb/alch is suuuuper good to make money and save money. Greater Fire pots are a must have for all MC raiders pushing content, so being able to craft and resell those is big bank.
---
Like pet pathing was fixed.  The real kind of permanent "fixed". 
---
People have been furiously trying to get a classic server for years, and now that it's close to release we have people saying they're going to get bored and hope they make new content in an intentionally time locked server...
---
Blizzard truly can never win.
---
You don't have to be an absolute no life to be main tank, you mainly just need to make every single raid night. You also need to either be guild lead or convince your guild lead you'll be super loyal to the guild because they will be funneling you a bunch of gear, and if the main tank bails for another guild it can absolutely kill the raid/guild
---
the things I liked most about vanilla that don't exist anymore are arguably what makes it a 'worse' game than retail. Imbalance and time commitment, accomplishing things in that game was way more a pain in the ass and there were things about each class that were crazy broken and that made them all uniquely useful.
---
Holy shit I am bad. Not sure how that slipped past me. You are correct, it is LW not Skinning that makes the salt.
---
I def like killing low levels and NPCs as a horde but prefer alliance for BGs, tough call
---
“Herb is the better goldmaker but you can’t kill people with gold.”
---
Love this outlook, good quote
