Is VanCleef's "The Brotherhood will prevail" line just a hearthstone thing?

literally just your opinion.  i could make a thread saying vanilla is overrated for a multitude of reasons but it's ultimately just my opinion and i'm not trying to deny people from experiencing it because i dont like it

you'd have to legitimately have brain damage to think tbc is closer to retail than vanilla.

Thank you. This 100%. Instead Blizzard had to dumb the hybrid classes down, by adding abilities and talents.
---
Depending on the rep I guess.  Casters are horrible for this type of AOE grind since you do way less damage to them and receive a lot more damage compared to good old'fashioned melee only mobs.  
---
You definitely can't solo farm 60 instances.  Killing elites is tough because they do a lot higher base damage and have much higher HP, but you will block/dodge/parry a lot more vs lower level mobs so there's that. 
---
A well palyed paladin with this spec could solo a ton of SM mobs at a time with clever pulls and use of cooldowns. 
---
I think you're best off killing EPL/WPL mobs (Naxx rep I guess?) or just straight farming.  Some undead drop runecloth I believe, coin drops, vendor trash, etc.

Just 9 days ago, a pretty big bug relating to instant attack normalization was [posted](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-instant-attack-normalization/200006) on the beta bug forum.  
---
Just three hours ago, a fairly huge bug relating to ranged attacks not being blocked was [posted](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-ranged-attacks-cannot-be-blocked/207452) on the beta bug forum.  
---
Those two bugs alone are relating to combat formulas. Combat formulas are some of the biggest bugs you can hope to find and fix in the game, and there are two that were posted in the past two weeks.  
---
More people need to be in the beta finding more stuff that is obviously hiding out there.
---
Yes just to explain this to the uninitiated.  Highlord Kruul only showed up in Desolace once the Dark Portal event started (just before TBC launch).  He eventually stays permanetly in Desolace till Cata?  Doom Lord Kazzak in TBC goes to Outlands.
---
We will be playing in 1.12 so Kazzak remains in Desolace and Highlord Kruul is not currently in Azeroth to my knowledge.
---
&gt; More people need to be in the beta finding more stuff that is obviously hiding out there.

The people that are in the beta right now are the people that are gonna find this stuff.

99.999% of people asking for an invite aren't going to anything useful at all, they just want to practice leveling routes.

Ignorance. Paladins, Shamans, and Druids could fill multiple roles. It sometimes required gear, patience, and creativity. Instead of just adding copy pasting abilities and talents from other classes, which is what TBC did.
---
Actually works! Thanks for teaching me! :)

One of my favorite memories was going to bed after fighting for hours, only to wake up and rejoin the same game. Frost mage was so fun. Nova and sheep people for days.
---
I don't know that I ever saw anyone in The Maul, but I didn't hang out there or anything.  It was way out in the sticks.  It was probably just for people running DM to have something to do.  It does spawn one of three rare mobs, which could have random BOE blues/greens, and they were your best shot at getting an Orb of Deception.
---
Are you saying in Vanilla Paladins, Shamans and Druids had better flexibility than in TBC and WOTLK?

This. I leveled ret which was quite slow but I was a noob so it was still fun and new experience. Once I could do BRD/LBRS and plaguelands holy wasn't too bad.
---
We figured it out, good job! :)
---
/druidshighfive
---
That mirrors my thoughts exactly. Most boot enchants aren't worth a talent point if you had them as an option, movement speed is a very special characteristic, but if there were other talents I could take, I would take them and sacrifice the very minor enchant of +7 agi or 9 stam or whatever it was. If you need filler talents take it, consider it the equivalent of spending 1 talent on 4 or 5 stamina.

My brother and I are leveling rogues in classic, and planning on spending most of our time in either Stormwind or Ironforge. Maybe some Deeprun Tram ambushes.... When the train is underwater........
---
I have bad news for you. We will get way more stories like this in a 2 months!
---
I leveled holy from 1-80 (vanilla thru wotlk). I'm proof that it is possible. It's a long grind, probably the slowest in the game. But you rarely die. It all depends on your play style and how much you are in a rush to get to end game. The bright side is you can heal any dungeon during the leveling process.
---
It's funny that layering is so bad that sharding looks good now.
---
If people actually cared about testing the game the beta wouldn't be dead lmao
---
If you want a PvP latency related example, as pointed out by w_v there is spell batching.
---
The problem is there ain't no flag in 2/3 of BGs or anywhere in the world. So you wouldnt put them very high based off just that would you?
---
&gt;That's what the massive stands for in MMORPG. By resorting to layering to resolve their obsessive need to control population density Blizzard is making a huge mistake,
---
You realize that a single layer will be just as big as a Vanilla launch (likely bigger) server?
---
This is the best loot system in my opinion that gets missed here on reddit. I was in a guild for 6 years that used this system and we had very little drama. There was an addon that made managing it easy and it avoided many of the pitfalls of DKP (bidding, hoarding, class alliances). Either you had the most EPGP points to get the item or you didn't. No fighting no arguing, you look at the addon and can clearly see out of the people who are interested in an item who has priority. It is too bad that I'm looking for a Classic guild and I have yet to see any advertised to use this system.
---
  
---
It isn't perfect by any means, you do have to create certain rules for off specs and main specs as well as legendary weapons. Obviously, if a 2 handed weapon drops and the fury warrior and the MT both want the item you give priority to the player it directly affects the most in raids (fury warrior). In progression minded guilds legendary's should go to the players it will benefit the most such as thunderfury for the MT first then rogues or fury warriors 2nd. Same with hand of sulfuras, dps warriors should get priority. All this stuff is common sense though. Any guilds that don't do this you should be weary of as being inexperience or heavily biased.
---
3 layers for 9000 people or 1 layer for 3000 people, the amount of resources per player is the same.
---
One layer of materials for 9000 people is more gamebreaking than layering. Stop.
---
tell why vanilla is overrated i am curious. not saying i even disagree with you.

Well that settles that. Tauren look like ass at low levels but that Tier one shaman shoulders on a cow makes me milk 😫💦💦

Becoming efficient with your leveling happens over years of experience. You're not going to "speed level" to 60 if it's your first time playing classic. 
---
&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy the leveling process for what it is.
---
Leeway is one of those things that, if not in the game, if someone suggested it they would be destroyed. 
---
“They should make melee range 10+ yards in PvP so it’s easier to hit people”
---
Go improved sprint. On a PVP server if you're being smart and saving your CDs, it will help you against any class with a slow. Riposte will only help against melee. Riposte is probably better for PVE.
---
If you have Preparation, you can break 4 movement effects with 2x spints and 2x vanish. Should be enough to mess up any mage trying to fight you.
---
Nikurles... I wanted something with Nick in it and I thought it sounded like a wow name, I was a slow 13 year old I guess. Idk how to even pronounce it
---
T. R3
---
Is this satire?
---
If not it is almost completely incorrect and/or very context sensitive, several of these specs don't even appear in most of classic pvp.
---
I am saying in Classic WoW they were more viable than players like you realize. Blizzard copy pasted abilities from other classes in TBC. They doubled down on this in WOTLK.  The hybrid playstyle was unique in Classic. It forced you to rely on sometimes all 3 trees to maximize your success. TBC dimished that and WOTLK erased it.
---
I am not a technical person but I don't think you can just activate sharding or layering in a ZONE. It is either ON or OFF and since each continent is like a server (no loading screens) I am not sure Blizz can actually do what you are suggesting.
---
&gt;Some guy was talking about how epic AV was when it first dropped. That you could que for a BG play AV all night get up on Saturday morning and que up for the same AV match. Because they would go on for HOURS sometimes a couple days.
---
That sounds terrible.
---
Hahaha quality video! Keep it up OP!
---
Human fury warrior only because human priest isn't too tier. :(
---
Stance conditions do not work in the vanilla API. You would have to use addons such as roidmacros and supermacro to make the 'modern' macro syntax (TBC and onward) work in the 1.12.1 client.
---
The spec was for me a middle ground for raiding,dungeons and PvP without having to constantly respec.
---
You don't raid with it unless you have 550+ agility prespec, I had 624 prespec when I raided with it, but our raid also had 2 other hunters providing  TSA
---
IMO the rogue tree has the absolute toughest choices in it. Doesn't hurt that there's so many useable rogue specs.
---
As a ret paladin, I needed 10 of it for my Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight. I'd run up, loot it, and bubble while running away. Worked pretty effectively.
---
Playing a rogue, and my goal is to eventually have alchemy and engineering, with an alt running herb/mining (running an addon for tracking nodes).
---
What's would be the best professions to level with, and what would the path to alchemy/engi look like?
---
Would it be best to go skinning/herbal until 60, drop skinning for alchemy, and stick with that until I have my mount and an alt bank full of pots/flasks? At that point I could drop herbal for mining, stick with that until I have a mats to max engineering, and then drop it for eng?
---
I think people will still want grave moss for shadow oils. Honestly lots of things wrong in what you have said as well, but I cant be bothered to go thru it all. DMT solo was 100% doable in Vanilla is the major one... its broken.
---
Hell yeah
---
While leveling the priest will stand no chance against a hunter, rogue or lock at the same level.
---
They had to nerf rogues because the new mouse over macros were too OP

Maybe if you're right by the bfd entrance. Anywhere south of that you spawn in ashenvale.
---
It was possible to do it in classic, doesn’t change that it is still exploiting and should be punishable
---
My plan is to get make a max number of characters name “Hunter” and “Paladin” etc 
---
Then sell the names to players later on if classic is super successful
---
That would be a useful metric if resources were only distributed evenly among all players.
---
I started playing late vanilla. As in I didn't reach 60 until after TBC launched.
---
I've never understood the 10 man dungeons. What's the history behind them? Are they dungeons or mini-raids? Why are they 10 man and not 5? Why did blizzard remove them?
---
They literally said that they planned on using sharding in the starter zones for the first few weeks when they announced that it will releasing in summer 2019 at blizzcon.
---
Yea but layering is o ly bothering streamers and swetters so its not actually a problem
---
Used to glitch out of AB early and cap a couple points every game. Never got a ban and I did this all day every day as a kid.
---
The main con is that the value of gear is still arbitrarily defined. If one leather bracer results in like 5-8% less of a dps increase than the second bracer, by what margin should their value be different? 90 vs. 100? Or 110 because it's the technical BiS?
---
Also, when it came to gear that probably wouldn't be used much in raids (I.e. used for pvp), or had a really specific purpose (Giving the Shadow Resist robe to the warlock for when you eventually get to Twins) we wouldn't have it cost points.
---
Its not my first time, I have leveled 11 characters to level 60, and 5 to 70 during Vanilla/TBC. I find it thrilling to try to do it quickly until about level 30.

Why not mining/eng?
---
Those are really good, thanks!
---
One I'm really missing - probably because it only works in actual classic, as it has the newer marcro system is this:
---
/cast [stance:1] Dire Bear Form(Shapeshift)
---
/use [stance:0] Superior Healing Potion
---
/cast [nostance:1] !Dire Bear Form(Shapeshift)
---
This shifts you out of bear, chugs a healing potion and gets you right back into bear form - as leaving the form and using the potion are both off the global CD, this happens instantly - you can't even see the form change. Obviously you can do the same for cat, mana potions, stoneshield potions, you name it.
---
I'm sure that could be done with the /cancelaura command as well, but this works, too (as I said on classic, checked on the beta. It won't work on (most) private servers and didn't work in Vanilla.
---
I see your point in regards to ability copy paste. But to say in Vanilla feral druids could tank when a double crit or a crit and a crush would just wreck them. Or paladin chain mana pots to do what warrior does just by being. Or people relying on shenanigans of powershifting druid helm and the mace with charges just to do OK DPS. 
---
Shadow priest and SL warlocks tanked in Vanilla as well but that does not make them viable tanking specs. 
---
To me all of the above is NOT viable..... it was doable but hardly viable.
---
I made my own spreadsheet to crunch the numbers for me, and it's pretty much a toss-up between Ironfoe and Lok'amir.
---
Yeah no doubt i suppose the real benefit would be to have another mail dps to gear out for more loot diversity, realistically it is an unoptimized raid build but definitely more than viable for clearing vanilla as long as the raid group is organized
---
ah herbalism the most ruthless of professions.
---
The only people it affects is those abusing the layering.

There will be as many times more resources as there are layers. Were you there for the last stress test? There was much much more available layers (ie more than 3) and people will be 60 within the first week. Even if theres 6 layers, then thats 6x the amount of resources they can collect. Youre also not realizing that the resources arent being contested like they would normally when a bunch of players are already level 60. Devilsaurs will be non stopped farmed by the first few players to hit 60.
---
5 I think. And king mosh give the leather 2 I believe
---
&gt; getting to Def cap
---
there is no way to "get to the defense cap" before way into AQ40. Not even in full wrath you'll reach def cap. At MC point 400 more armor and 30 more block value is way better.
---
Fire res is nice, but only for a selected few fights even in MC.
---
No, that would be Cataclysm.

There would be so much less drama in this if it was a Tauren herbalist.
---
The number of competing farmers would increase at a relative rate to general server size.

1 farming rout used by n farmers for 1unit if population is comparable to 5 farming routes used by 5n farmers for 5units of population.

This is a really good resource.

Was he a druid that then switched to a warrior and hunter? Warsong like 6 years ago?
---
They should only have one server for **everyone in the whole world** with no layering so they get over their "obsessive need to control population density".

We had an implosion one week, we were slow poking through MC and getting lambasted by Onyxia for weeks. On our way into Onyxia, MT pulls and then Harry's... Followed by guild leader (priest). Pandamonium ensues, "top" of the guild heads to bank, gquits/transfers and leaves us with our primary rogue/assist as leader. Next week we down Onyxia with 27 person "left behind scrubs" raid. 
---
I think the next week bindings drop when we have a bear tank and a new/alt warrior tank. Nobody wants to spend DKP on it because they aren't a tank nor have enough.  The most heated discussion ensues as EVERYONE is yelling in vent for rogue/new guild leader to just take them.
---
Lots of drama turns into a fun success story as lil Chuch the (only?) healer in BGs was trying to transition out of PVP into PVE "because it was less time consuming". I miss my time on alextrasza post-schism in Darknova(PVE) doing bad impressions of Rennis and pre-schism pick BG'n with lilgrmonstr and Onyx.
---
Jesus fuck. Guild drama was at an all-time high.
---
I'll admit that I'm a little foggy on how points were assigned for gear in terms of value (I haven't played since cata). Although, I do specifically remember that weapons were the most expensive items to purchase, which is fair as they are usually the biggest upgrades.
---
&gt; Also, when it came to gear that probably wouldn't be used much in raids (I.e. used for pvp), or had a really specific purpose  we wouldn't have it cost points. 
---
We would do this as well for off tanks. If a tank item dropped that our MT's didn't need we would start giving the gear to off tanks. Better to gear other warriors in case they are needed to tank for a raid than to DE the gear. As I said, EPGP isn't a perfect system, but if you implement some pretty simple rules it can be a very good loot system.
---
Yeah, just because there aren't any loading screens doesn't mean that it's all one server, that's more of a client-side graphical issue. There's plenty of footage of people walking out of Ironforge and 20+ people suddenly popping into existence the instant they step into Dun Morogh.

What build is he running? Something like this?

---
Sorry to sound elitist but you come off as somebody that's not at all experienced. How could you not know what a decent pacing is after leveling '*11 characters to level 60'* \- your words.
---
A decent pace typically is &lt; 2 hours from 1-10. For a warlock it could be slightly less if the server is dead (which it won't come launch). If you plan your route accordingly and gain experience by exploring from 1-5 to get ahead of the pack, this could be mitigated and 2 hours from 1-10 should still be attainable.
---
Fully agree, but don’t let the NOCHANGES crowd hear you say that
---
Fuck me dude. You got me.
---
No. The leap of logic was you conflating with sending nudes to being a sex worker.
---
Christ.
---
What a waste of time.
---
Yes, and /u/johngallo0892 was saying that might be due to the fact it only uses one core..
---
why are you and your friends in stv on different layers in the first plcae? 
---
Usually everyone logs out in a rested zone anyways and if you want to play with friends logging in is the only time you would have to change layer. 
---
Obviously it would have to be that changing layer is only possible in rested zones, but its not required that everyone is in a rested zone. You simply change the layer to the one that the person out in the world is on.
---
So if you log in and want to play with your friend that is in stv atm you invite him / get invited and it  changes your layer to his (because he cant change his layer to yours since he is out in the world).
---
If you think the first few 60's wont go and abuse layering to farm devilsaurs and black lotus etc then I dont really know what else to say lmao because it's most definitely going to happen. You dont speed level to hit 60 then get your pre raid bis and prepare for MC. The first 60's will free farm the resources using guildies to invite to each layer and control the resource market. It will affect the entire server when they have so much capital to control the market pricing. Youve obviously havent played a private server and seen how impactful this really is. You are actually incentivized to abuse layering which is game breaking. Also, WHY is sharding worse than layering? Its the same thing but for lower levels.
---
That's actually something I hadn't thought about! Great advice!
---
i don't really think it's overrated it was a hypothetical; i love vanilla.  but i would argue that class design/itemization was pretty rudimentary in general and the honor system was a big miss.  
---
i love leveling in vanilla, way more than tbc, but i find myself getting bored once i hit 60 (on pservers at least, i played a ton at max level in vanilla) and i think it's mostly because i don't find classes that fun to play
---
What lol, unless you are a top guild pushing progression I'm not sure how raiding mc and bwl would foster negative feelings unless someone was ninja looting

If you are maxing +spell damage, then it could be possible that a continuous +50% attack speed would be absolutely BIS
---
You could still get free unlimited internet porn back in 2005...
---
Lmao at people downvoting, have fun getting gouged on the auction house
---
Not a bug. Yellow attacks obey different rules for range.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but decursive would just cleanse anyone in your raid that needed it by pushing a button, without you even needing to target them ... in Vanilla.
---
Believe it or not, one of the major draws to play Classic for me was the knowledge that the people I would see around me in the world would not inhabit some other instanced/sharded/phased plane of existence the next day. The idea of a *persistent shared world*.
---
Originally wow dealt with the issue just fine by using server queues. Vastly superior to layering. 100k players on one server is absurd and nothing like original wow.
---
Easier said than done. I am sure there were technical complications that is why they went to layering. Sharding and Party invites comes to mind. Can ppl from different servers be in the same shard like they are on Retail? I mean why else would they go to layering if sharding was working and it is sooooo easy. 
---
Bottom line I was in the first to lvl 5 stress test. I think it was something similar to sharding because people, mobs, critter would just pop in and out everywhere, it would move you from shard to shard .... it was soooo unstable.
---
&gt; If you think the first few 60's wont go and abuse layering to farm devilsaurs and black lotus etc then I dont really know what else to say lmao because it's most definitely going to happen.

No one said they wouldn't. Guess what - it doesn't change the amount of materials per person.
---
So, again, do you honestly fucking believe one instance of resources is CORRECT for TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE? JUST SO A FEW PEOPLE CAN'T FARM?
---
?
---
I don't really see the point of a new account. There is still the possibility of account bound purchases applying to Classic when they eventually cave and implement the shop for the game.
---
Rolling a mage for the first time, hate Gnomes so going human. Want to be an alchemist so I can obtain the grain. Don’t much care for being top FPS as long as I get invited to things.

---
Are you trying to say that having a surplus of items on the auction house is going to make us get gouged?  Do you even supply and demand?
---
So if layering in for 2 weekz its completely broken the game for you?
---
If you listed to the Vanilla Lead and one of the game designer talk about the game things start makings sense. And yes the entire continent was one item. So I would not be surprised if the current problem is more technical and less monetary......
---
I mean, no.
---
The fastest leveling routs are almost exclusively questing. Joana's being the most prominent guide, but even blizlike pserver guides follow similar routs.
---
AoE grinding is possible and valid with the right class and support, but I covered that in my second point re:valid alternatives.
---
&gt; Originally wow dealt with the issue just fine by using server queues. Vastly superior to layering. 100k players on one server is absurd and nothing like original wow.
---
Yes, it is, but guess what? We've got a fuckton more players this time around on day 1, and instead of the population growing after day 1, it's going to shrink, tremendously.
---
Môrak Undead Rogue. Dunemaul. It was so hard telling people how to add me
---
Agreed, it is very easy to see if a lc is corrupt all you need is 1 night with them, people complaining about loot council noticed the corruption and didn’t leave so it’s on them for getting used. You see corrupt loot council gquit and move on.
---
You're telling you level pressing only one ability?
---
When you have a large supply of valuable goods, then you can sell that and amass large amounts of gold. You then buy out any competitors and re-list for a high price. Or use that gold to buyout other areas of the market and re-list it for higher prices. Do you even know how auction house works
---
WTB this feature.
---
What part of the leak says classic will fail?
---
oof.  ruined the original :/
---
I used to use a lot of accents on character names too, was definitely hard trying to explain to people what alt-code to use xD
---
welfare gear started in TBC
---
For the 1000000000000000th time on this subreddit, most people would be okay with a classic+ as long as it doesnt replace actual classic. Boy I sure hope someone asks the same question again
---
Or just face tank everything like we morons did in 2004.  You still get xp off greens and people will love you if you like to tank dungeons!
---
Because people will make deals of not using dkp for set pieces so they can hoard dkp and still get the item for free with a /roll
---
Especially since I’ve forgotten myself 💀
---
Yeah, and then they realized how bad sharding is. Anyone who's played 5 minutes of BfA knows exactly how bad it is.
---
I never said that, but yes, If I knew layering would be gone in two weeks I'd strongly consider waiting an extra two weeks before joining Classic. But, more realistically it would depend on what my other friends choose to do.
---
Yep! Congrats man. You can now level up to 60 and be awesome.
---
Cute deflection. I win.
---
Servers aren't down. Everyone got that from the last stress test.
---
You don't have beta
---
Yeah they are forsure
---
Nah. People got bored in thr AV test just a few hours in. "Epic" battles consisting of sniping overextended melee opponents gets lame fast.
---
He didnt say pugs.
---
&gt; I never said that, but yes, If I knew layering would be gone in two weeks I'd strongly consider waiting an extra two weeks before joining Classic. But, more realistically it would depend on what my other friends choose to do.
---
If layering didn't exist you wouldn't be able to login for the first two weeks anyways, so it works out pretty well.
---
I'll keep an eye out, thanks.
---
I've literally just been blocking every person that makes one. Maybe one day I'll get them all.
---
Factions were a terrible idea. Jaina and Thrall made peace at the end of WC3. The wow trailer literally has to go out of it's way with exposition explaining that the horde and alliance are on bad terms. The only trouble to peace would be sylvanas. Even then you could make the undead a neutral faction itself in the lore and just let undead player characters group with anyone.
---
Obv the beta, settle down there bud, haha.
---
Hazek
---
Lol might as well just pug then.
---
Thank you good sir.
---
How is it new though? As everyone else has mentioned, Runescape already broke this ground.
---
You have no argument so you deflect. Cute. I win.
---
No, you're totally right, an economy that has 1/10th of the amount of resources it should is way better.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Nonsense. A farmer can only cover so much area. If someone is farming in ungoro they are not also farming in eastern plaguelands. However, a farmer *can* farm in eastern plaguelands on 5 different layers.  Thus one hardcore farmer on one server cannot farm every zone, but 10 hardcore farmers on a 10 layer megaserver can farm every zone as each one will farm all the layers of one area.
---
Not only will there be mafias, but sprinkle in 7+ layers of devilsaurs and now a well ogranized mafia can make 700% more gold
---
Going most likely Orc or Troll Warrior
---
I have a team of:
---
Friend 1:
---
Subtly Rogue
---
Friend 2:
---
Frost mage
---
Friend 3:
---
Warlock
---
Friend 4:
---
Restro Shaman
---
We will be levelling solo till 20, primarily doing PvP getting highest rank as we can, but plan on finishing all major raids eventually (but slowly) 
---
I am only going Warrior because, look at my team, I kind of have to, I like warrior but I’d rather choose like Spriest, Hunter, or Ele Shaman, but since if I choose Warrior we would be a nearly perfect 5man team
---
&gt;Dire maul tribute: in diremaul tribute runs (Which was not a thing in real classic.)
---
Dude tribute runs were a thing in real vanilla.
---
Best zone in the game!
---
&gt;must for M
---
i cant upvote this enough. I was a rank 13 druid and i played 14/32/5 exclusively. You literally can do everything with this build, and having NS is a huge loss for pvp as feral. Alot more damage and utility out of omen of clarity, lotp, and natures grasp. Not to mention the shape shift cost reduction. Idiots like soda, who have little knowledge of old school feral, swear its not good... but it wrecks, especially if you stack strength. DOT up your targets with bleeds that tick hard af, and kite/tank
---
Exactly what I've been looking for. Thanks!
---
Thousands of ppl have posted that exact screen shot no you dont have beta. Settle down bud.
---
Based on these comments the only troll here is you
---
I was Horde up until WotLK. I had a Horde shirt. I have the Windrider cub plush. I was all about the Horde. Love trolls, love lady orcs.  
---
\-but this time I want easy access to cat pets, saber mounts, and the ability to get the Winterspring saber. I think my user name hints why I want all those. That and I do like the Alliance city layouts better.
---
You are speculating. Your guess about how things are going to go is worth approximately nothing in my opinion. Do you have any arguments that don't revolve around your guesswork?
---
Class balance and phenomenal pve raid progression makes TBC one of the greatest expansions ever released.
---
You have to look at it as it's own game, talking down about it because how it is different from classic is ridiculous.
---
If we could have the class balance of TBC, and the social/world structure of vanilla it could be the next big mmorpg to dominate the market.
---
The Macro commands have changed and some of the information available to addons has changed. I think it is premature to say whether addons will hurt the game. 
---
I mean DBM and similar addons arguably saved raiding. Imagine doing Vanilla or TBC raid without it..... not a lot of ppl could keep track of all the abilities the boss was casting.
---
&gt; Do you even know how auction house works
---
Much better than you do.
---
I see. Makes sense
---
I'm excited to roll "need" on those things too
---
I guess i'm the small camp that thinks both the unfixed version and fixed version looks awful.
---
Why not have the best of them both? Non-sliding feet and slow moving arm movement.
---
Turning big green bars into small red bars?
---
could someone animate this on Wallpaper Engine please?
---
It’s not gonna be hard no matter what they decide to do.  Unless they drop the debuff slots to 4 and use the talents from 1.0.
---
We know the proc doesnt scale. There's several videos of "shockadin" specs in PvP showing the 8set only doing 60-66 additional damage even with large amounts of spellpower.
---
&gt; Another question is does the extra damage proc weapon procs and chance on hit effects? 
---
This is not know yet, because like you say the Beta is capped at 40 and there's not enough videos of the set to get evidence from there. We have to wait and see.

I'm not sure what you're getting at? The scripts and macros in vanilla gave you way more power than the current.
---
Should add who brings consumables to that list and who’s on time and show up for farm nights even if they don’t need stuff
---
I had a DM farm strategy in retail vanilla. I would use the secret entrance to DM which required a key, the entrance looked like a large column with mobs surrounding it in middle of forest area. Then I would kill 2 or 3 of the easy bosses and some mobs. The mobs were good for chance at a libram which was used for ZG enchants I think, and bosses to vendor items and chance at a recipe or something.
---
Dang. I was hoping to get a canvas print of it!
---
It doesn't matter how much damage the Mage does because the Mage can't do damage if he can't cast. Your only guaranteed cast is if you land a grenade.
---
When monopolies are attempted "LTB x Devilsaur leather, whisper price per" makes the nerds waste all the over buying.
---
If anything laying makes a mat monopoly way harder to get going.
---
But for BiS Mage lists I see, the Level 47 Frost ring is considered the actual BiS for a few raids.
---
&gt;worth approximately nothing in my opinion
---
Your opinion is worth nothing because you can't seem to understand that artificially reducing the amount of resources per player than would naturally be in the game is actually bad for the game.

Hunters having to track down pets and spend time with it to learn the ability it had. Tracking pets down in general was my favorite part of WoW, trying to track down a glitchy pet or one with a fast attack speed. That shit is my JAM. I didn't mind not having to have a quiver and exotic beasts were cool, but Hunters losing mana was the last straw for me, stopped feeling like the class I grew to love in Classic.
---
Yup, and sometimes "true vanilla experience" is at odds with "accurate vanilla"
---
Steamvaults  underbog, mechanaar, shadow labs, shattered halls, ramparts, blood furnace, auchenai crypts, mana tombs, arcatraz, caverns of time (three diff dungeons but most remember escape) and thats just off the top of my head.
---
A lot of people loved TBC. Class design was much tighter, and raids were arguably more difficult. I can understand that you liked the classic design philosophy more but please dont be an ass and act like no one has any business enjoying or wanting TBC again
---
I hate you so fucking much. 
---
You did not get in. 
---
This is posted 10x a day

"You're encouraged to explore" in BFA? Bro, what BFA are you playing. I literally just fly to my world quests, run a few yards, complete it in 30 seconds  then whistle my self back to the flight master.
---
There is no exploration!
---
Bears are terrific tanks for 5mans, and early raids. If are not feeling warrior.
---
No
---
I remember back during the TBC launch when both factions of the entire full-pop server were trying to cram into Hellfire Peninsula. There was some server instability right at launch but nothing that prevented me from progressing. What makes you think this will be an order of magnitude worse?
---
Go for it, my man. That thing is an outstanding goal/accomplishment/swag.
---
Doesn’t matter if it isn’t the best piece.
---
Doesn’t matter if the probability of the eye is low (never tell me the odds!)
---
Back in vanilla my brother and I were in the same casual raiding guild. Great gang all around, focused on fun but cared about some progression. Anyways my brother, and enhancement shaman was a core raider, and he had his eye on the hand of rag. Long story short he/we made it happen after a while and it was such a huge thing not only for himself, but the guild too. Everyone had a blast watching him inch towards it. And once he got it, seeing that thing swinging around onyxias layer, or MC (back in rags face) was rad for everyone that was a part of it. Not to mention how pumped my brother was!!! He and I (a priest) duo’ed in pvp too, those WF crits were great! Okay maybe there was something technically better available, but seeing that glowing orange hammer smashing gnomes was unbeatable in my book.
---
I had to reply to you because I recently found my old hard drive circa 2006 and I found the video of him crafting sulfuron, and subsequently the hand. It brought back so much nostalgia and feels. I wouldn’t want you to miss out on the journey and reward of such a lofty goal because it’s not “best” in slot, or it could take forever.
---
Anyways, back to calc homework. You do you, man. Play the way you enjoy.
---
I think everyone got that with the most recent stress test from a couple days ago. Unless you have an email from blizzard saying that you got in to beta, I wouldn’t worry about it.
---
Pwnninja... I was young.
---
Except you need an invite to the layer, and you can't force a hop to a specific layer. The number of farmers needs to go up even in your given case.
---
&gt; What makes you think this will be an order of magnitude worse?
---
Because there's going to be millions of players trying to login to a tiny number of servers????
---
First character I leveled above 10 was a Night Elf Hunter named "Shron" I think it was a random name. I dumped him at lv 16 because I hated buying arrows and feeding that stupid cat.
---
Oh man, I totally forgot until now how people would create characters for the opposite faction, just so they could track with /who and hunt people down.
---
what? every healer is more than fine for 5 mans and none of them even need to be heal spec. there's nothing so wrong with shamans that would mean they or their tank needs to be raid geared.

I’m not saying you do, I’m saying I’ve run into people leading the raids that demand it on pservers.
---
^ this guy 😂
---
I'll have them completely maxed out. To be honest I wish they upgraded all the graphics to retail level.
---
Sweet, I think the hybrid will be perfect for me unless I get way into raiding!
---
Night Elf Warrior. Find group of newbs to grind lv 5 mobs outside of the starting zone because that's the only way I could level in the most recent stress test.
---
This

I get that this sub is predominantly Alliance for God knows why but where's the Horde love?

What an epic response! I got a little emotional going on that nostalgic journey with you.

Now I'm even more pumped to achieve this goal! Thanks for taking the time to reply. :)

FluffyKitten - Orc Warrior
---
AB is very similar in that you use the survivability + mobility to solo def, just repeatedly taping flag cappers until reinforcements arrive. Druids are less useful only after you fill out all static defender slots.
---
Thank you &lt;3 saving this comment for launch
---
&gt;Sex is moral because sex leads to moral questions.
---
Everything in life leads to moral questions. The point is that someone's sexuality or sexual behavior is not inherently moral or immoral. Tying morality to sex and nudity void of anything else is exactly what fundamentalist christians and incels have in common. 
---
&gt; A woman who has had more partners in life has trouble pair-bonding when she wants to settle with a man
---
Only if they specifically want to date incels that give a shit about how many partners she has had in the past.
---
&gt; (most women will want kids and a stable provider/partner)
---
Do they now... you seem like such an expert on what women want. 
---
&gt; Sexual acts that might make a woman feel like she is "selling herself" can damage her selfesteem. You might say that the problem with her viewing those acts as bad is "society's view on sex" which is when I would remind you that that is societies prerogative to hold a cultural view they want to, and it will be rooted in facts and statistical outcomes.
---
oof.. 
---
You were right in guessing my response to your first part; if someone feels bad (read: shame) about a choice they have made, it is because they believe they have done something wrong, regardless if what they did was actually wrong or not. So, society is often to blame for peoples' lack of self esteem, which shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. 
---
However, you're saying that society's view is based on facts and statistical outcomes? Sorry, what? Are you also implying that society is therefore correct in having whatever view it has? Then I need to ask, which society? The society of the USA, the society of indigenous Australians, the society of Shia Islam, the society of Polyamorists in Portland, Oregon, the society of ...? Was the Southern US society based on facts and statistical outcomes when it enslaved millions of Africans? Did that make it OK? 
---
You're basically saying someone should feel shameful about their sexual actions because it comes from society and society is right. That's concerning.
---
Stop
---
It’s not called loot lag, it’s called loot anticipation
---
Needs more lag
---
I don't even know what you're trying to argue at this point. That servers wouldn't have a cap for concurrent players? Or that Blizzard wouldn't open a number of servers proportional to demand such that queue time's are kept withing reason? Those are both silly propositions.
---
&gt;sexual norms
---
What if I told you there are thousands of different "sexual norms" all around the world. In fact, the monogamy that you are assuming is natural is extremely new to the human race let alone the rest of nature and not at all a ubiquitous trait.
---
It automatically squelches you after x amount of reports (IIRC, it was around 10 within a fairly short time frame).  Squelching means you can only speak to your friends and your guild.  The squelch lasts until a GM can review the reports.  This can take hours or even days, which would be debilitating in Classic.
---
Aside from the obvious avenues for guilds and such to abuse this feature, it doesn't even need to be a concerted effort-- if you say something controversial ("I like retail WoW better than Classic" or something as innocuous-yet-contextually-inflammatory like that) in a reasonably populated area like the Barrens, there's a very good chance that a bunch of random people will respond by reporting you and you'll get squelched.  That'll make it impossible to ask for help, get groups, etc. until a GM reviews it.
---
Furthermore, because the rules on trolling and harassment are so subjective and nebulous, it's unlikely that anyone would get punished for reporting you unless it was very obviously a directed attack.  This means there's little in the way of a deterrent to prevent people from essentially abusing the feature, unwittingly or otherwise.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Ah Dethecus, WoW's proud toilet.
---
I played an orc hunter on there since vanilla, just transferred off to a populated server recently.
---
That's not BiS for a high spell damage build, that's BIS for an absurd min-maxy spell-damage build that's loaded up on consumables and world buffs.
---
this is 100% reportable and should be reported. there are similar locations in the horde base.
---
I'm sorry, but it's pretty obvious you live a life of hate. I don't really have anything else to say
---
Agreed. 1 continent per mob spawn or GTFO.
---
I can see it happening for sure, not as often as in vanilla but you'll see or hear people in trade chat talking about their 10 hour long av.
---
&gt; Or that Blizzard wouldn't open a number of servers proportional to demand such that queue time's are kept withing reason?
---
That's the alternative to layering. And it's much worse.
---
yeah ok i'll pay that :D
---
These tier lists are never consistent. Warriors should only be in a high tier in group PvP, but if we're talking group PvP then Shadow Priests and Warlocks would be much lower. Premades are taking Ret Paladins and Feral Druids before they take a Shadow Priest.
---
So the people still sold their items, getting them gold, and the person buying them like a tardbag only hurts himself because there is no assurance or tracking system to show him what to gouge or if it will even sell at a higher price. This isn't runescape grand exchange.
---
I never said anything about ragequitting on a group, but if i can only find a known shitty tank over anyone else id rather just wait it out. Im not gonna kick someone because of a few mistakes thats just stupid and gonna waste more time.
---
Still got laid with a hot girl. Who cares.
---
My first WoW character's name was Amertune.
---
I think I'm going to pick something new for Classic.
---
Main at 60 and alt at 35 in 8 or so weeks. Epic mount before phase 2, which I imagine is 12-16 weeks.
---
Joana also tasks you with grinding mobs to and from every quest. Purposely avoiding the road, he also said that his questing guide doesn't work for more then a couple of server first level people because the effectiveness tanks on contested questing areas
---
Don’t need 7 people, all you need is 1 person to get the rep with hydraxian Waterlords, set up summons in mc entrance and in azshara and have the dude go back and forth, meanwhile you have multiple groups running lbrs to get ubrs key to kill emberseer for the quintessence quest.
---
Omen, recount, and a quest helper for sure. Not sure yet beyond that.
---
Join for Classic
---
Don't forget the Legacy
---
One is gold
---
And the other Silver
---
Hand
---
Yes he has no clue what he is talking about. He is missing specs and which some are very strong in pvp. He even said it was for bgs. Which healers swing the tide more then any single dps
---
Malfurions Blessed Bulwark... I doubt I'll get through BWL this go around ...
---
Steam summer sale just started.
---
Open the option for people to transfer their character to retail (with the transmogs and achievements with it) or stay on the "classic" servers as they transition to BC-Classic, and maaaybe again with wrath.  
---
at the end of the classic server's lifetime, let it stagnate for a year before "forcing" everyone to transfer their characters/transmog/achievements to retail, and reseting classic for another fresh go at vanilla.
---
Fire mages and warriors with gear are just stupidly good. A 3 minute mage or a warrior with FAPs with ranked pvp gear are two classes that make you go, "Woah, what just happened?"
---
I think hotkeys harm the game too, clearly we should all just be typing "/cast Fireball" over and over like we're playing a text adventure.
---
Anh so you're just going to complain and offer nothing, but more complaining. 
---
A story with nothing to do with layering. 
---
No idea offered. 
---
No point to your post.
---
The guy literally called his reply a "well-formed rebuttal". You've got to be kidding me if you can't tell that he's trolling. He went on a pendantic rant trying to redefine the word invisible just to defend his point.
---
Simply make the system not do anything to the person being reported at all until a gm reviews the reported timestamp. Ezpz

Anyone that thinks the Modern APIs for addons and macros is going to lead to trivializing the game clearly never played Vanilla.
---
The Germans can't even get their own Nazi server, no way we gettin a special one just for no BGs.
---
Because most of this "QoL" shit you retail plebs love so much A.) would be needlessly inauthentic in a game whose main design goal is authenticity, B.) affects gameplay dynamics, and/or C.) affects social dynamics.
---
Don't like it?  Don't play it.  Not everyone likes a sterile, convenient gaming experience.  This is for us.  You have other options.  Utilize them.
---
What a disingenuous thing to say to try and blame me for making a serious point, take care of your kids or stop giving them false hope, how is that hateful? Raise your daughter to respect herself and not be used by strangers for sex, how is that hateful? Dude....
---
It's much better if you ask me. Server groups with shared name pools and quick and easy server merges in the future if needed. It's the optimal solution as I'm concerned.
---
You can't be backstabbed while channeling on someone.
---
It could be highly possibl If it happened inbetween 2004-2006
---
But how do you get more than preraid bis without raiding
---
Every class has a role to fill, not all DPS classes have to top meters to be relevant. Perfectly balancing 9 different classes and maintain class identity is nearly impossible. If all classes did the same DPS then the ones with the most utility would always be desired. 
---
In retail DKs, Druids, and Locks can all battle rez (that I am aware of), mages and shamans can hero/lust and there are no buffs given by a class, such as fortitude or arcane intellect. 
---
And even with all that class identity removed there will still always be a flavor of the month spec making it so if you want to do high end content you will not be invited to raids unless you are those class/specs.
---
I vastly prefer having a class identity and thus having some classes be more useful than others. You are still going to see all 8 classes participate in raids.
---
There's literally nothing different between clusters and just a bunch of different servers. They are exactly the same. And layering is a lot better than a bunch of servers.
---
Yeah, it's like a game show. 30% chance to be "Did I GET BETA?!? So Fucking HARD Right now"
---
30% - "LAYERING SUCKS OMG WHY CANT 30K PEOPLE PLAY IN STORMWIND"
---
15% - "WTF, I want a Polish server for me and my 23 friends"
---
10% - "WTF? SUB SO EXPENSIVE? I HAV TU PULL 5 TEEF OUT FOR SUB. WHY DOESNT BLIZZ PAY ME TO PLAY, CASHGRAB?"
---
10% - "Old AV was fucking sick bro, I want play in an AV in the morning, drive across the US, log onto WoW, and play in the SAME fawkin AV bro"
---
5% "Asmongold just finished all over my face. It was soooooo dreamy, WATCH HIM DO IT, CLICKHERECLICKHERECLICKHERE"
---
Can you wrap your head around either "We're giving you 1.12", or "we don't actually have a copy of 1.5 AV"?  Because both of those are true.
---
The requirement on Sinister Strike is literally "Melee Range".
---
This is a bug.
---
Legit was worried about that, seems minor to some but it's really not.
---
I have no doubt you enjoyed it back in 2007, but I am not convinced many players would feel the same nowadays.
---
Good for you buddy.
---
What if I told you most of those sexual norms involved children most of our history as humans, our intelligence and technology has evolved faster than some of our baser instincts, another example is fear of the unknown (seeing a person with a different skin color), people might feel that on a primal level but we know intellectually to question it, just like fucking everything that moves leads to spreading disease, and contributes to unstable households for children.
---
Just like they didn't have a copy of Classic wow #pepelaugh
---
Um that's wrong. That would mean 3000 people per layer. People in the stress test were describing the Barrens being empty on layered servers.
---
"Elephant in the room" typically refers to a topic that is not being discussed even though everyone is thinking about it.  
---
AV has been discussed out the ass.
---
Fire mages with tier 2 set can hit some nasty procs.
---
&gt; you can't change models
---
Well that's a big false.
---
Sharding in the starting zones would be much better.
---
I think this thread is a big eye opener if you're considering letting your wife/gf/companion play WoW with you. So much cheating and deceiving.
---
We can argue semantics all day but I think a healer who can turn into an off tank or dps or provide support via innervate or roots on a moment's notice is the very definition of a hybrid.
---
Game must be broken, that‘s wild !!
---
It was the Stress Test, nothing more. You do not have access to the Beta.
---
Just saying my experience from leveling a holy paladin during cata. Was god awfully slow. Not a lot of attack abilities then. Only gonna be worse in classic. But benefit is that it’s harder to die so you’ll save time on running back to your inevitable corpse.
---
Without automation, what purpose does the system serve, then, except to make it easier to report someone?
---
I'd argue that making it too easy to report someone is a _bad_ thing.  It likely creates a lot of frivolous, unnecessary work for what is very probably going to be a skeleton GM crew to sift through.
---
If someone is truly misbehaving, then opening up the help menu and writing up a ticket won't be a problem.
---
On both sides of this "argument".
---
There are two months left. Blizzard knows how important this is to a *lot* of people. Have some faith.
---
Also
---
There are only two months left. Some of these issues are seriously glaring, and we have had no official word on the layering abuse. Blizz, under Ion, is notorious for ignoring feedback in beta, shipping an incomplete product, then apologizing in some dumb Q&amp;A with a promise to do better. 
---
And here's the tie breaker....
---
You all clamouring for peace, and wanting people to "chill"....there's no net benefit potential if the loud-mouth complainers comply. You get a more relaxed subreddit for the next two months, and that's it.
---
The loud mouths *might* make a big enough stink to cause real change though. And if it means this subreddit is a little less enjoyable till launch...well, I'm 100% OK with that.
---
Modern problems require classic solutions
---
Just cause your an elephant in a room doesn't mean you should disrespect my title
---
Believe what you like.
---
You got into the beta!!!  Congrats man!
---
When was the last stress test? I've been checking regularly in the app and this is new for me in the past ~48 hours.
---
Hawt
---
Krátôs.
---
Not God of War, but Tales of Symphonia inspired that NElf Huntard's beautiful name. Had the full Defias set and everything, never got beyond level 28 tho.
---
The biggest problem : layering and eu server are yet to be answered.
---
It's still in a dead state for the moment. 
---
Circlejerk won't save the game as much as I would like to
---
My god is it only 62 days?.. fuck yes
---
We are not close enough to those data centres to get sub 150 ms pings, I have measured it. The only DC we can get those pings to is Taiwan so lets hope they have classic realms there.
---
Here is a druid dueling mages, he SEEMS to be unable to...
---
&gt;  Mage can't do damage if he can't cast 
---
I mean don't get me wrong, it seems druid favored as we both agreed, but it isn't auto lose, and the mage does deal A LOT of damage. Fire mage that pops a FAP is gonna be able to blink FAP and free cast, the druid would have to kite then I guess.
---
Max everything like I do for every other game.
---
June 19 to June 21. You probably just needed to restart the app to see the update.

I mean I never played WoW for plot, but even then I'll take that inconsistency over half the weird time travel stuff they put in later expansions.

what??

This is terrible for bgs LOL

My Sprite Darter went everywhere with me! &lt;3

We will wipe you on galv.
---
Was just going to mention shammy, cleric or druid
---
This is at least 8 sprints. We good
---
Layering can't exist in Phase 2 due to World Bosses, Blizz has stated this.
---
So because Jeep has consistently made lemon cars over the past decade...   just because they hired a few new people to make another new car.... we should just wipe the slate clean and act like the team is 100% uninfluenced by the company they work for? 
---
As that's exactly what you're asking us to do.  Forget that the company has a huge track record of fucking things up, not listening to their customers and just doing whatever the fuck they want... just because they hired a few new people into the team.
---
Yeah...... Nah.
---
You mean the stress test that was there to test how many people a server could manage, and how things worked at 1x, 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x etc population?
---
That stress test? My layer was [pretty fucking crowded](https://i.imgur.com/4DSmLwM.jpg)
---
Good thing they're testing this all out, right?
---
They said they could, because that's what they said they were going to do. After the outcry they changed it to layering. And I agree with the OP: sharding would have been better. At least they were only planning it for the starting zones.
---
if you haven’t realized, everyone on here is a game dev. we all know everything about everything, and need it to go exactly our own way, or we’re gonna cry like a bunch of fucking man babies. the people on this sub really need to get a life besides classic, because it’s clear most don’t have one or they wouldn’t care so much about such asinine shit
---
Preaching to the choir man. Only way is to get in a guild that’ll carry you. It’s like applying for jobs straight out of university and every job posting asks for 5 years experience.
---
We dont want to watch you stream lol

Shiiiiit
---
Old AV was a grindy AFK fest that ended up giving people multi-day queues, theres a reason it was reworked and never changed back
---
Wow, thank you so much! Super interesting stuff, I'm super curious to hear how the culture is different on the various asian servers. Or just any other region really.
---
It totally changes the way the honor grind works by forcing people to account share to have a chance, for instance; all grinding is done in BGs because of it.
---
Despite what another responder said, it is also fun and immersive to be in a world pvp with a player, accept a queue, and see them in the BG; it’s very good for healthy meaningful rilvaries. People that want faster queues should play full pop.
---
Cross server bgs were the first change towards the “accessibility” crowd that actually, like so many other changes, made the game less accessible. Now you’ll have no lifers go to a low pop servers so they can be scarab king and still blow people away honor farming bgs into the wee hours, when without xserver bullshit they’d only be able to farm honor by world pvping outside of server prime time.
---
In this way cross server Bgs are very damaging to player interaction as well.
---
I could go on, but basically in every way that lfr, sharding, and dungeon finder are bad for the game, so are cross server bgs, for the same reasons; and it was the first obvious mistake they made.
---
Tbf, it was common in Vanilla for melee to be hitting autos but get out of range for abilities.  
---
I don't know when this was fixed so I don't know if this is accurate for 1.12 or not
---
We must find TUNABOAT
---
What are you, 12?
---
Convinced the bf to play, but we didn't go for synergy with our classes and more what we actually wanted to play. Hunter/Warrior, Mage/Hunter, Warlock/Mage, Rogue/Rogue. He'll be my pet until lvl 10 on my hunter and then he'll be my dead weight from 10-60. The others have better synergy and the rogues are to be obnoxious as possible in wPvP.
---
not my guild but my gf in high schools friend who she lived with her parents played wow and the dad left for some young girl in cali (we live in canada alberta) they told me.  also he had 3 kids he left with the mom(i think were his)
---
I don't know what's available, but this is what I want:
---
* Someone that automates repairs, restocks, and selling greys
---
* Something that lets me know how much threat I have on mobs
---
* Something that lets me know which self-buffs have expired
---
* Something that lets me know how much a vendor would give me for items in my bag or for quest rewards
---
* Something that lets me fish by right-clicking on water when my pole is equipped
---
* Something that displays dungeon maps and loot tables
---
* Something that makes the auction house a lot nicer to use
---
I'll probably play around with others, but those are the kinds of add-ons that I've liked.
---
Nice job Karen
---
He called him and "elephant in the room" after he defined the term as something no one talks about.
---
Strawman; FakeNews. Play a full pop server if you  want faster queues.
---
People make the same trash argument about dungeon finder as well, and it did the same kind of damage to the game, in some case less then bgs.
---
&lt;The Immovable Objects&gt;

I understand the strength of the orc stun racial, but the human sword specialization, I must be missing something, how is 5 extra points in swords worthy of mentioning?

---
But also something people are thinking about, makes no sense
---
We can get back to '' I can't wait or what should I play" topics
---
How does a mage get "bored of fire" in Vanilla when your only other viable option is spamming frostbolt?
---
I was out of the raiding game just before naxx and watched my flat mate in there night after night for weeks and was really grateful I didnt feel the need to do that any more.
---
Which is fair but its gonna be my wife, she isnt the best at the game just yet lol
---
I mean current AV is just running and capturing a few points with 0 opposition then base racing the other team's Commander. The longer AV may be flawed but current AV is utterly boring
---
Don't bother wanting your time with him. You're right, he just likes to pick fights over nothing.
---
precedent is there from BFA. ill believe it when i see it
---
you can still turtle AV, its about the only way Horde wins
---
Howlingmoon. NE Rogue.
---
All the rogues agree with you. Redshorts is just a retail kitty. Don’t forget to pet him.
---
If there's a port of the EP/GP Addon for Classic WoW, I'll gladly use it. Used this system shortly in Legion in a progression mythic guild, and while it wasn't the best for that guild (loot council would've been better for sure) 
---
Atleast I think that's what it was back then. I don't quite remember, except that it had a neat interface and that you'd accumulate points over time? If anyone knows if there are other loot system addons similar to it, please do tell. I used it in the Tomb of Sargeras patch.
---
I guess so. But making it take so long to report people is a deterrent to a lot of people not filing reports at all and allowing rampant assholery
---
The music that plays during this quest scene is pretty af.
---
Fuck her right in the pussy
---
Oak never wanted to catch them all. He realized he could just outsource that work to children for the low price of the latest cell phone.
---
While I agree with the sentiment, the FUD isn’t without merit. Everyone screamed for the entire BFA beta only to have none of the issues addressed. It seems either a more caring team, or a team that hasn’t been put on a massive leash, or a bit of both, is fortunately on WoW Classic.
---
Now brother you know that's not the way of the Silver Hand. We shouldn't make fun of the mentally disabled, the light looks down on that.
---
If you want to experience "real" AQ/Naxx you're a decade and a half almost too late.
---
destro in B LULW MONKAS POGGERS WATFACE
---
&gt;How much do you jack up the rewards
---
Enough so that people actually bother doing them. Blending PvP and PvE in a BG is a nice concept, but it failed with AV unfortunately. 
---
&gt;is the meta now to just go in and do repeatable quests and not even fight?
---
No the meta right now is to just ride past eachother and rush to the boss. I want to change that so that it becomes more of a gather resources first, then try and attack, gradually pushing the enemies back. Sorta like a moba actually.
---
&gt;How does the commander role direct people? Do they just draw on the map? Do you just get a special chat color? How long do things drawn on the map last if you go that route? Is there a punishment for drawing penises?
---
I have been thinking of this and without radically changing the UI and mechanics of vanilla I believe the best idea is to let the commander assign objectives in some way. For instance there can be some set objectives that you can choose; attack IGY, defend bunker, collect hides etc. And they will appear on people's maps as targets. This is already done in some addons and could easily be copied into the engine itself. Also there should be an incentive for people to complete these objectives, I'm not sure how to balance this without making it easy to exploit.
---
&gt;The other things are bug fixes and not changes to mechanics so I'm not going ask you questions. The point is, there are even more questions than what I came up with in one minute to question how you're going to implement your brilliant design.
---
Of course there will be questions and I can answer them, mostly.
---
Almost the same but with elvui :)
---
Absolutely!
---
Programming.
---
It's not magic, mate.
---
Thank you for this. Don't you think not getting counter-attack is a mistake? Furthermore, I wanted to ask you if you could help me with a build as a dwarf hunter for world pvp against rogues. I want to kill all enemy rogues on my way to 60, and I don't care if it makes leveling more inefficient. I want to Hunt rogues with my Hunter.
---
I lmao because that hunter was probably me
---
No, they didn't.
---
Ohman, I remember Big Red Kitty.
---
He’s level 80 in this pic
---
Nope not yet
---
I swear to god i was guildmates with a guy on a small german Private server a few years back, he was called wimcewind, the guy was hillarious, he would tell us a lot of these kinda storys with almost the same exact kind of poetry and humor, i miss the guy. Anyways thanks for the great read!
---
you could straight up use lua scripts in vanilla. addons today are weak compared to that
---
Mike morhaime was canned for talking back to Activision. They own blizzard now, being able to even fire a co-founder and president of blizzard basically mean they have full control already.
---
Fuck no. Keep complaining. This is how shit gets fixed.
---
Rad
---
Oh shit, I totally missed that and it would explain why the only Masturvader ever seen is a Blood Elf Mage.
---
What's happening with dissipearing skeletons?
---
No its not. 
---
Source: the rogue beghind you.
---
Not vanilla but my guild stole another guilds raid id for the server first vashj kill
---
For every correct leak there is 8 fake ones and 1 that just make a very wide prediction based on a guess. Very few are actually legit.
---
My advice for anyone running a guild in classic, if your guild uses DKP for loot, stick with it. Don't switch to loot council after the fact.
---
My guild, which I loved to death, had used DKP from its first raid in MC all the way to the opening of AQ. I was mage class officer and even being in the private voice chats with the other officers, I have to say we were pretty drama-free, considering the kind of horror stories you hear.  We had a very reliable core and had no trouble filling spots.
---
But everything changed when one officer insisted we switch to loot council. "We can't afford to be casual if we want a shot in Naxx," he said. "We can't afford to spread our gear thin if we ever want to kill KT," he warned.
---
We caved. Every class was to decide on a gear priority and submit it to their class leader.
---
Some people left immediately, and I can't blame them. They joined a DKP guild, after all. A few dedicated people that already had most of their BiS and had been saving DKP for AQ were justifiably upset. The more casual raiders that maybe only showed up every other week suddenly needed to make a document ranking their gear priorities, something much more hardcore than they were comfortable with, I'm sure. Of course some people never submitted anything. Classes that needed the same gear started arguing with each other too. And us class leaders were supposed to take all of this and make it into something meaningful, and decide who gets what and when.
---
Now I'm sure most will agree that AQ40 is a significant step up in difficulty compared to MC/BWL/ZG. Even the trash between bosses requires a lot of practice and can easily wipe a raid that's lost its focus. And how are you supposed to focus and keep your cool between wipes when your text log is entirely pink because people aren't happy about the loot prio that was decided an hour before the raid? Needless to say no one was happy. Three officers quit the game in one night, if I remember. 
---
Then the next week, when we were getting our raid together, we only managed to get 37 people. A mere three people short. I guess that was the signal everyone was waiting for, because everyone bailed ship after that. I remember logging in a couple days later and my name was the only one left on the guild panel.
---
Ultimately it was no one's fault, I think. We were just a DKP guild that bit off more than we could chew and decided to transition at the worst possible time. We switched because we aimed for KT, but in the end we never even killed C'thun.
---
Shoutouts to any guildies that might read this. Hope to see you in Classic.
---
Yeah lol not even close, maybe farming devilsaurs lol

No I did not. Reading is hard apparently, when you’ve already made your mind as to what the words going to say...
---
That's because it was a test server. Who really cares when there's no investment on their characters.
---
i had billybaddass on my friends list on perenolde US, i wondered why he never logged in again. glad to see this is why.
---
Well that depends if Oceanic gets a server or not, being Australian I already deal with shit internet, on top of the uncertainty I might not a get a localized server, maybe leeway would help me here.
---
&gt; There's probably other reasons, but Classic is simply a complete game.
---
That's demonstrably false if you look at how many classes were chopped down and incomplete in '04 and how much content originally intended to be in there was cut and saved for TBC.
---
Again, if someone is truly being an asshole--to the point where they're actually breaking the ToU--then I don't think it's a big deal to just open up the appropriate menu and write up a ticket.  Short of that, I think there's _just_ the right amount of deterrence to prevent [most] frivolous tickets.
---
It's a self-moderating system which, to my mind, is perfect for a game like Classic.
---
Or we can just let them do what they are going to do. There is a time and a place to give feedback on these things.  This isn't either. If you played during the stress-test and felt the need to give feedback, they had a forum for you to do just that. Posting videos of the clear abusive behavior from the beta can be helpful but these empty posts about how they should do this or shouldn't do that is nothing more than the hot air that escaped from my ass earlier this evening. Just my opinion tho

---
World record is 1hr as a rogue i think. Youtube should be full of old speed leveling vids
---
Olgra on the left
---
Thinktank on the right
---
No. They'd have to do an overhaul and actually make the old models translate to the new ones, instead of being bastardizations of their former selves.
---
Slightly off topic but Icy Veins now has a small Classic section with leveling advice as well.
---
I won't really be that mad if we don't get servers. We played the game until late mop before we got servers. We'll survive. I'd rather have full servers on a laggy connection than a dead server after a month
---
The biggest aspect i'm most looking forward to is the drama and shit talking.
---
Have they addressed regen time? I was getting all my mana and health back in 5 seconds on the beta.
---
Druids are fairly decent at flag defending. The ability to stealth, track, and swap gear depending on who is at the node, makes them decent at solos sniping as well.
---
Screen's on low brightness rn and for a second I thought Thanos was wearing Nightslayer Cover (Rogue T1 Helm)
---
And yet I've been in tons of riveting WSG matches and have been consistently grateful for the flavorful map and narrative it provides.
---
US-Proudmoore will serve your needs
---
It's purist attitudes like this that will cause people to flee from Classic in droves. Saying it's "a few months top" is hardly defending it, I'm not a fan of it by any means. You take the good with the bad. We're lucky to be getting Classic at all, take your entitlement back to retail. I hear they just released a patch with a whole bunch of brand new shiny Obama gear.
---
Im not a streamer. But ive got close to two 40s and some 25+ on the beta.
---
"Starting a new character in BFA"
---
&gt; I can't wrap my head around why NOT have the long epic battles of AV back in classic.
---
Because no matter what version you pick... They will not be long epic battles again. It isn't the map that is the issue. The issue is the player base wants honor per hour and rep. 
---
The only way to revive those battles would be to completely rework AV so the end doesn't matter and the objectives and time spent in the battleground does.
---
Comparing grass to how someone makes their character look in the CC are vastly different things. The new models don't translate the old model features *at all*. Gnomes were cute and now are abominations in Retail.
---
My guess is blizzard will shut all gold sellers down and make bots that sell gold, they will own a bunch of sketchy looking websites but this time around it's okay to not use a prepaid burner card, because we all know it's a blizzard sister company.  Oh, the GM's are essentially gonna be the devilsaur mafia to create the need for buying.  Jk, I dk dude.
---
OOK OOK
---
No RPPvP servers at launch, meaning many original Vanilla players won't be able to return home.
---
it's funny that people think layering and sharding are different things
---
Oh noes he cropped it and threw a filter on it. Chill the fuck out. The point is he gave credit. No need to be a pretentious douche bag.
---
I don’t want retail features, well graphics sure, but I want classic to evolve in vanilla spirit.  I appreciate your assumption and great addition to the conversation.
---
I would precisely say, since complaining didn't get shit done with BfA, why bother now? Let's count on the team and keep reporting, idk
---
Sounds like you are ready to roll over and die. My condolences to your family. The only thin empty is the lack of appreciation for creative thinking in your point of view, timing is obviously not ideal or really relevant. Layering is likely to last many months. Opportunity for change is always there, don't be quick to roll over and settle.

The true definition of “post-nut clarity”
---
Forbsesdad
---
You are not getting that classic version of AV of which everyone talks about in legends. The version of AV coming in August is possibly the worst of all worlds. None of the character of the original incarnations and all of the suck of an empty BG with no reinforcements to end the agony.
---
“Official pvp tier list” *leaves out every single healing spec* LOL. Hope I never have a drooling pleb like you on my team in bgs...
---
guess it depends on where you live.
---
Unfortunately I don’t think you’re cool enough to be a part of the Forbes clan
---
I disagree. I didn’t play past BC, but they were always worth a solid sum when I did. Maybe they’re the most expensive thing now in retail or something, but they had significant value during my playtime
---
Funny, 8 of the 10 AV I played in the beta test the other week resulted in a multi-hour standoff at the Stormpike Graveyard because Alliance turtled and never attempted to go for Drek.
---
The new script system is restrictive from what I recall. I don't think you can have a spell check if a user has mana or not and use a specific spell based on that with a Retail macro. I don't think it has range checks either, and I know I used these scripts in Classic.
---
I didn't make an appeal to societal norms fallacy, I used society as a proxy for empirical evidence, studies, individuals/groups of people, and common sense. I am invoking it as a real occurrence, but not making an appeal to it. The woman listens to society and feels a certain way afterwards, I more or less appealed to how women who feel negative feedback are responding to a certain signal that not all women care about, meaning they DO care about it. If you do ANY act and feel bad after negative responses, it means you personally desired to feel approval of it.
---
&gt;  fundamentalist christians and incels have in common. 
---
You left out muslims who marry children, have a prophet who married a child under 10, force women to wear bee keeper suits, and stone adulteresses. Interesting that you used 2 anti-right wing buzzwords, projecting much?
---
&gt; Only if they specifically want to date incels that give a shit about how many partners she has had in the past. 
---
Or if biologically they were hardwired to care, but you don't respect men's aversion to raising kids they don't trust are their own, genetically speaking, but respect some women's preference to sleep with 10 or 100 or 1000 partners.
---
&gt; Do they now... you seem like such an **sexpert** on what women want. 
---
Fixed this troll comment for you so it accurately reflects reality.
---
&gt; oof.. **"+ strawmans"** 
---
So I noticed you made the woman an object again, maybe *she* feels her actions are wrong and worthy of shame based on her own moral or personal beliefs. Maybe *she* sees merit in society, or her family, or whatever outside entity she appeals to when forming her own judgements. There are women who feel no shame, they prove you can ignore societal standards if you want, why do some choose not to? Morality as far as I know isn't objective anyways, we just have more consistent or less consistent moral systems we form in our heads. 
---
I am just a little confused here, I said....
---
&gt; Sexual acts that might make a woman feel like she is "selling herself"  can damage her selfesteem. **You might say that** **the problem** with her  viewing those acts as bad **is "society's view on sex"** which is when I  would **remind you that that is societies prerogative** to hold a cultural  view they want to, and it will be rooted in facts and statistical  outcomes. 
---
People do not have to approve of her actions, and her suffering from not being liked is exactly zero percent their concern or fault, it is a reflection of her and her value system. **quick analogy test**. Do you believe in or support society holding negative views towards a person who identifies as a member of the Klan? (to be clear they do not engage in illegal acts of violence).
---
&gt; You're basically saying someone **should** feel shameful about their sexual  actions because it comes from society and society is right. That's  concerning. 
---
I said it happens and there are real reasons, **SHOULD**, is a very loaded term. Pro-tip is not to do the "basically" thing and to just represent my argument honestly without strawmanning it. Society(individuals or groups of individuals) doesn't have to mold itself to fit your or a licentious woman's axioms, for all the reasons you blame society I can blame the woman.
---
This is an ad hom or some evidence you aren't as high a caliber as you think you are. In a debate there is something called charity, it amounts to the benefit of the doubt in a verbal form. So when I say something like sex work leads to bad outcomes, you might expand on that with honest intentions instead of ignoring it and making your entire response a strawman over some phrasing you tried to take out of context (but was not damaging to my argument even if it was taken in correct context, I CAN argue this from an appeal to society and win I think, it just isn't worth the energy and we both agree it's a fallacy).
---
oh those are all factors in on preformance. Also willingness to sit if they know they arent getting anything and such like that. And Buffs like if you want to go out and get world buffs to help us clear faster if we didnt call for it that will be a factor too.
---
No!
---
Yep!
---
No? What?
---
If we look at anthem not buying the game doesnt help either XD  They're going to do what they want regardless.
---
The kicker will be if it fails they'll just go back to "Well we were right, You thought you did! but you diddnt! hah!"     
---
completely ignoring the layering / right click report / bugs  as main causes of people leaving.
---
TL;DR
---
In an ideal world, they find a copy of 1.5 AV and add it as an extra queue option that you can only get to by walking your ass out to TM+SS to queue for it.
---
Why would it be perfect by now? Why would anything be 100% correct one month into a beta and two months before release? Layering is not an issue until it's been a problem for a long time and is there two weeks before launch and EVEN THEN it's not guaranteed it'll even make it to live that way, and since they did say it'll be gone after a few weeks, sure it's vague but it gives you a clear idea of one fact: it's not here to stay. So sure, keep an eye on it all you want, but don't yell at blizz for layering a beta if they're testing it out, jesus... Not saying you do obviously, saying people shouldn't.
---
How is that much different from what most people do in Vanilla at max? Most people just fly to their mat farming spot of choice and farm while queued for BG's or they farm while trying to put together groups for dungeons. That was what end game in Vanilla was for most people.
---
Well atleast you’re honest
---
Amen brother. "Look, we yelled and it happened, you're welcome" unbelievable...
---
I downvote anything with “layering” in its title, and even though I agree with you, I must commit. I’m sorry little one.
---
There are still hundreds of hard bugs(things not working or acting as intended) there is the fact that casters can cast backwards and that the simulation of vanillas spell batching isn't working correctly. F.ex Auto attacks being bathed so it breaks stealth or kill you after duel ends.
---
Still a lot of animations are wrong and water still being see-through on max settings. 
---
There are still tons and tons of work to be done if you look below the nostalgia hardened surface
---
Creative thinking? If you are so creative go build your own game and see how it does. Game development is incredibly difficult. We have to appreciate what we are being given, to a certain extent, a stop talking about how to change it before we even have it. We have not fully seen how layers will or will not act at launch. They have been testing them for a while now and we are taking those tests as end products, they are not. There are 600 players on the beta and there are an incredible number of layers for them to hope between. That is very clearly not how it is supposed to work and if we use our brains we can come to the conclusion that they are simply testing things. This last stress-test showed us that they are changing up variables to test things and asked that we give feedback on what server and when we played so they can get a better idea of how layers are funtioning for the players. They are not going to rebuild them from the ground up at this point, they are going to tweak them at best. We have to live with that and help them make them the best they can
---
In the old days it was tagging along and leeching at level 51 to get your level 60 blue weapon. After that it was all about looting body parts and saving them up for reputation for your level 60 epics or cheap mount. It wasn't really necessary to rush.

Then that is truly sad...  
---
I'd still much rather them re-implement the old AV and make steps of fixing it rather than continue to do the same old AV we've been doing for years now though
---
A friend of mine did that out in Georgia after the Navy. After two years he was making about three times what he made as a IC in the Navy.
---
Somanan the Nelf Fury Warrior
---
Hope you forgot the /s, else you're clearly a moron. It's not just booting up an old game. They're reading old data with a new engine and have to fix a ton of bug. It was announced in 2017 and is now in Beta, that's for a reason.
---
It'd because it's not really spellbatching but an attempt to simulate what spellbatching was.  They just don't seem to understand how they can do it so they ended up batching every action in the game
---
"BC Waiting Room" is on the table for a guild name, just sayin'
---
You'll face less competition, though!
---
I respect the commitment.
---
 I also never said classic was hard, just that private servers have *proven* to be harder than beta. Which is factually true. 
---
Are you ok?
---
You seriously don't need to go that hard to limit Layering abuse. Just come up with a ruleset that makes it impossible to predict.
---
First, prevent switching Layers on your own by the logout trick by simply forcing all characters of an Account onto the same Layer. Being able to swap Layers by switching characters is obviously a bug and will be fixed.
---
So now there's only two ways to swap Layers: the server decides it needs you to swap (can't be predicted or controlled) and joining a group with a player in another Layer.
---
1. If a character is in combat of any kind, temporarily suspend all Layering until a sufficient time after the combat has passed. We'll call it 30 seconds.
---
2. If a character is in a city, rested area, or starting zone, or recently left one of these areas, or is on a flightpath, ALWAYS choose to layer them no matter who was party leader beforehand.
---
3. If a character recently looted anything, always prefer the player that didn't to get Layered (while also following rule 2).
---
Otherwise, make it completely random but force rejoining the same group over and over to make the same decision.
---
There, now abusing Layering is prohibitively time consuming, unpredictable, and not worth it.
---
*2 weeks, potentially till phase 2* fixed it for ya.
---
Is there information that they don't have 1.5 AV or are u just speculating??
---
If this is for bgs then why is sub rogue A tier lol
---
1.  Never defend a tower you try to capture.
---
2.  Always go backcap.
---
3.  Enjoy longer AVs.
---
We cant talk about something else because no one has brought up anything to spam as the new "this is my concern and why it breaks the game" karma farm.

I don't think you've played vanilla or understand it's tier list, not being a dick just saying it how it is.
---
&gt; 2 weeks
---
Try 2 months.
---
I want Layering, but I do want small changes made to the rules governing when Layering happens so it can't be easily abused. Which Blizzard is probably working on already.
---
I really wish people like you would just shut up about layering. Honestly. It’s not that big of a deal. And for some reason you think blizz should devote what would likely be hundreds of man hours for some overly complex system that will become completely irrelevant after a couple weeks to a month. Right.
---
Lmao that would be something! "SEE YOU DIDN'T, TOLD YA"
---
Maybe it’s because I was never lucky (unlucky..?) enough to bang a fellow guildie, but I *felt* this one more than any other story in the thread. 
---
We always had guys mess around like this, but not on a fight that really mattered. Oof
---
The new macro system is seriously gimped compared to the old Vanilla macro system.
---
If you think that modern macros are OP then you either never played Vanilla or you were too young to understand what a Macro was.

On gorgonnash-us ours guild main tank full t2 with thunderfury told the guild master he had cancer, just to inform him he might miss some raid Nights, one morning on the guild motd we were told that "the main tank name" stole the entire guild bank and xfered His character, we later Found out where he was playing and we spammed His true indentity Everywhere in org/uc
---
The only one who looks stupid here is you.
---
They've said before that they didn't think they even had 1.12, but that they found an archive of it (one specific version archive) in a safe.  Common belief is that they don't have any older version of WoW to work from.

no

I love this reply. I work with engine control software and when people say “OMG JUST FIX THIS ONE THING” it drives me insane. Haha. People don’t realize how one software change anywhere can have massive impacts downstream on logic you didn’t know existed or looked at that parameter. 
---
If the fix was as easy as changing a 0 to a 1, we’d all be happy.
---
Well thanks for going to a childish level, I won't follow ya
---
Mods on this subreddit need to do something about the layering and “am I in beta?” Posts.
---
These people that keep posting these threads about how bad layering is and how blizzard needs to use one of the brilliant solutions for it that they came up with should honestly be handed bans at this point. Every thread is just the same low effort bullshit over and over and over. They’re only making people stop caring because it’s just annoying at this point.
---
STRUTH.
---
Sorry for my language, blimey.

You’re literally complaining about content on a 15 year old game
---
I know pally mains that say it's the worst thing they have ever done, but they are maxed and continue to play because pally.
---
Bingo. 1.5 AV works the same as 1.12 AV, its just slightly longer. Both versions are the worst BG in the game where the playerbase rushes past each other to PVE.

You can settting up any mouse buttons (mouse buttons, or key-modifier+mouse buttons) to perform any macros or skills. It's very usefull for healers since you can cast any spells on mouse-over on unit-frames with any mouse clicks combinaisons.
---
I used Clique since 2006.
---
A key-modifier is buttons like SHIFT, ALT or CONTROL on the keyboard.
---
God no.
---
Imagine trying to play with a controller.
---
Tauran shaman (level as enhance but go ele/resto pvp spec) but I will level to 60 as fast as I can. Which will be much slower than most 
---
Will mostly level with quest and dungeons
---
While leveling up I think I will go herbalism/skinning and save the herbs for alchemy at max level and sell the skin for $$ once at max drop skinning for alchemy and then once alchemy is maxed I will drop skinning for mining and get the mats to get engineering to max level 
---
Once at 60 try to get pretty nicely geared as quick as possible and start my second toon 
---
Second toon will probably be either a rogue/mage/Druid/priest. Not sure yet but I will level this toon with mining (for the shaman) and the second depends on the class. Rogue/Druid will get skinning for money (and maybe LW), mage will have tailoring, and the priest will have enchanting at first for the wands but eventually dropped for tailoring
---
We will see if I even do all of that before I plan more
---
Yeah, makes absolutely no sense for everyone to greed. There's literally no benefit to it, except that it allows a scummier player to ninja it.

[It's actually pretty great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5K2NrSZvO4) with [ConsolePort](http://consoleport.net/home/).

I would add that private servers are terrible at policing bots. Economy will be very different on that alone.
---
so? its not like those guys are working alone? people are already developing addons for layerhopping, if its abuseable in the slightest bit people will do it. vanilla gold is too valuable for people not to try and abuse stuff.
---
you're right.   I shoulda clarified and said this is just really hard to look at. So many contrasting elements and the loss of the focal point, plus the uniform sharpness on everything just make it so straining on my eyes
---
I dont know if it is going to be 80% or 70 or 90. But 50% is a conservative estimate. As to population going UP after the first two weeks ...... that would be abnormal. Possible, but very unlikely.
---
Orc rogue would be mine. Resist my stun and then stun lock me? Fuuuuuck
---
There is one on alliance that is just as bad.  Surely you know this because he was in our game, abusing jumps in the alliance base.
---
Male undead shadow priest with their kick ass offensive spell cast animation.

Idk if you have heard about this thing called having your own will? Its really cool. Makes it so you can choose to ignore what others want you to do and do what you want yourself. Also makes you responsible for your own actions. Like this girl was responsible for leaving her bf for another man

is NS really not that great for PvP?  was planning to focus on wPvP but with an 8/22/21 build - still getting the shapeshift talent from balance and FF from Feral but 21 points in Resto to get NS over HotW and LotP... been reading through different guides and tier lists but there doesn't seem to be a consensus.
---
&gt;How can that even happen in a DKP guild?
---
My first ever guild used a silent bidding DKP system where you would w/ the raid leader your bid. Naturally, his close friends always seemed to know exactly how much to bid to outdo the next highest bidder by ~5 points.
---
Learned my lesson pretty quick there.

Can we stop complaining about people who complain about layering. It's not quite as old. 😀

Ret can 1v1 rogues and occasionally warriors.
---
Ya. But that is what I'm saying. They obviously have out keys to people they thought would play a ton. And that's good. Gets lots of testing. But come launch, most people won't play that much. It will take much longer for most. So in reference for cries of nothing left to do. Most players won't encounter that issue for way longer.
---
Never had any issues in Aus on wow even with 260 ms back in the vanilla days was still smooth

**TL;DR:** Our personal enjoyment of a naively-built MMO should not have a higher priority than the return of a multimillion dollar blackmarket industry which preys (hacking, identity-theft, bank fraud) on the most vulnerable of our fellow players.

Reach out to him.  I like your description.

they were 10 man because they were hard with five people!

i mean eventually groups had it down where 5 man was totally doable, but early on no one knew what they were doing. you NEEDED those ten people because people didnt have shit figured out yet

Would be great for something like farming herbs
---
When the game releases.

Meanwhile, I hope everyone in the actual beta or in a position to help prepare for the release continues to be as extra and turnt on about all issues as possible.
---
They have to be unchill now so *everyone* can be chill in August.

What classes/specs are considered mechanically intensive or require a high APM to play effectively in PvP and PvE?
---
Creative thinking? so does your system have any negatives? or is it a silver bullet solution? If you want to be honest with yourself and truly provide ideas you need to demonstrate pros and cons. 
---
so what are the negatives of your system? How can it limit or be exploited?
---
For some reason, I made a human priest named Irwillivan.

Hey someone speaking sense
---
Yep! And [the New York Times, back in 2007](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17lootfarmers-t.html), rightfully **roasted Blizzard for it:**
---
&gt;“Like the majority of M.M.O. companies, Blizzard has chosen to align itself with the customers who abhor R.M.T. rather than the ones who use it. A year ago, Blizzard announced it had identified and banned more than 50,000 World of Warcraft accounts belonging to farmers.
---
&gt;Of course, nobody expected the farmers’ equally rule-breaking customers to be punished too. Among players, the R.M.T. debate may revolve around questions of fairness, but among game companies, the only question seems to be what is good for business. Cracking down on R.M.T. buyers makes poorer marketing sense than cracking down on sellers, in much the same way that cracking down on illegal drug suppliers is a better political move than cracking down on users.”
---
Married couple in my guild.  The husband is a hardcore ERPer aka just straight up cyber sex, but his wife claims she doesn't care because its just pixels.  Fast forward to some new guy joining the guild; turns out he lives in the area, and he went to high school with the wife who works as a nurse IRL.
---
One day he shows up at her work unannounced "just to say hi" with a box of chocolates for her.  She never told him where she worked, or what her hours were, but for some reason she found it incredibly romantic instead of incredibly creepy.  I guess her husband staying up until 2am in Silvermoon meant he wasn't spending much time with his actual wife.  Creepy guy keeps showing up in her life, and its super obvious he wants to bang.  Turns out, the wife was actually really bothered by her husband's "role play" and revenge fucked this guy to get back at him.
---
Of course, instant regret kicked in, and she asks creepy guy to keep it a secret.  Which he agrees to and as long as she keeps banging him on the side he won't tell her husband.  Straight up black mailed into sex to protect her marriage, and of course after a few months she confesses to her husband.  The creepy guy had apparently been coercing her into a bunch of weird fetish stuff and she had enough of being manipulated into it.  I was like 19 at the time and the person who was telling me all this said I was "too young" at the time to go into details but it was apparently pretty hardcore stuff.
---
They later found out the guy has a history of stalking his old female classmates and has been jailed over it along with several restraining orders against him.  There's a good chance he had been creeping around outside their house watching her play WoW until he found what server she was on in the first place.  The husband had been complaining about "raccoons" knocking shit over in their yard for months before this all happened.  Naturally, the married couple got divorced after that mess, and rather than living alone the wife started dating and eventually marrying the creepy dude.

Good times.

You can actually play pretty well with a controller thanks to [ConsolePort](http://consoleport.net/home/), an addon for WoW specifically made for it.

Explain why you think layering isn’t a big deal?

It’s actually so detrimental towards vanilla I don’t see how you can be fine with it?? Oh wait I know....your precious server stability at launch
---
One time, back in 2015 when Free2Play and doing WSG at lvl20 was a thing, it was often said (on the f2twink forum site) that enhancement shaman sucked. Oh well, I didn't need more to show up how to play an enhancement shaman in WSG and being good at it with videos as proof. And then, it was often said to be good at WSG, it was really gear depended and everyone needed BoA items. Once again, I showed up it wasn't true by playing every specs of paladin with only green and blue items (with videos as proof).
---
Back in Vanilla and TBC, I played a retribution paladin and I was good at it in BGs.

Nope. Totally worth it for solo play on a couch or even dungeons if you're DPS. I probably wouldn't try to heal a party with it, but otherwise it's great!

you mean ffxi? where you literally had to hold R1 or L1 to bring up a list of macros and manually scroll to each macro for each action you make?
---
Its for arenas
---
Speaking of private server bias, you're claiming a lot of things that are just absolutely not true. I've never seen multiple nodes spawn in the same spot before, and you're vastly overestimating the effect that dynamic respawns have on nodes.
---
Layering will enable rare resource (black lotus, devilsaur leather, etc) monoplies more than dynamic spawns ever have on private servers.
---
it can work in tandem with other systems,  like I said fine tune it the way you want to. It worked awesome,  we got server firsts with that loot system. There you go.
---
It’s because of the version of AV they picked. The version you most likely remember is when they had the bosses and extra pve sections of AV. This is the version that was deliberately trimmed a third in map/objective side, and this is the version that deliberately aimed to make it shorter. I remember some AV matches would be 8 hours of war, but that was an early version of AV. To be honest I like the true battle field of early AV like you seem to remember.
---
Shattered Halls, mana tombs, hellfire ramps, shadow labs, arcatraz
---
This is the point that seems to have finally won my friends over on trying WoW. They didn’t want to jump in because everyone else currently playing has 10+ years of experience and is an expert and knows what they’re doing, at least from an outside perspective. So now that it’s looking like it’s a fresh start, they’re much more willing. To give it a shot
---
Hunter / Lock were basically lay down and die because they could kite you into mobs and jump you so easily. Spriest was ridiculously strong as well.
---
I'd say overall - An undead Lock. Even if you "won" the fight, the dots were probably going to kill you anyways. Orc Hunter was probably a close second.

Tbh I like the view of the original better than this re-color. IMO, Ironforge should have that soot/steam pervading the air and the lava/braziers giving the city that orange hue
---
This has to be satire.
---
Almost no thought was put into this... I’m going to assume this is for a pure DPS standpoint? And not success rate? Because if it’s relevant to winning, you’d obviously have to put in healers for one, and even then it’s not all about just pure DPS.
---
When it comes to PvP, it’s a Rock Paper Scissors type deal, some classes do great against some, and others don’t. Arms Warrior, is an obvious power house in PvP only with a healer though, you did not state in best circumstances only though.
---
Now some DPS you put on this list are not purely meant to just kill, like for example the feral Druid, one of their best uses is flag carrier, while something like warlock would be terrible.
---
Also you did not care to put every viable option, only some optimal ones, yet you put Ret, but left out Fury, where in some circumstances Fury COULD do better then ret. 
---
Since you did not clarify a single damn thing, you could have put nearly every spec, since each one COULD do great in any very specific scenario, like 3 minute mage COULD do better then Frost if you look at just burst DPS, or even Ele vs Enhance, most the time I would argue Ele is better for PvP, but then look at that one video of Enhance, I’m very certain times Enhance CAN do good.
---
These are my primary reasons why I believe this either has to be satire or you just don’t know what a tier list should look like especially for wow, a tier list doesn’t really happen since like I said it’s Rock Paper Scissors, and certain scenarios, and every spec is better then others at very specific things, not all related to DPS.

You shouldn't plagiarize other people's writing man. Not cool.
---
There may well be another Druid doing exploits on alliance side, but literally every single game of WSG I’ve played has had that one certain Tauren jumping around on rooftops. If you’re talking about that hour+ game from earlier today, it was a lot of fun, but also a total slog. I really hope these ‘sploits are fixed. They make games unwinnable when you enemies use them, and stalemates if both sides use them.

Who cares about finding a premade as retribution paladin?

Who should we care about what people are playing as class as long they are good with it?

If I tell you that I haven’t read the article you shared, but the information collected from other sources, I don’t know if you will believe it.
---
100/played would be 60 in 4.16 days which would be a new world record... Isn't the current record like 4.2 days played? Or are u making a joke?
---
I’m more then happy with this.

Thank you for your contribution to this new and exciting topic.

&gt;I work 9 to 5. I gieve a shit about queues. I have a limited time to spend playing wow and I want to spend that time playing wow not fightinng the queue boss
---
So you'll uninstall the game if there's a queue on day 1? jlawokay.gif.  What if there's an hour long queue on day 2?  15 minutes on day 3?  What if you have to wait for a whopping 30 seconds on day 4, could you fit that into your busy schedule?  What if... On day 10, there is a half second momentary when you try to enter the game?  Does that delay your gratification enough where you finally quit playing?
---
Dear god it's like you have created some sort of queue boogeyman, like you think there's going to be queues every day forever and you'll never be able to play the game.
---
In REALITY where the rest of us live, you *might* have queues for a few days max, just like every single other expansion.  Then there will literally never be a queue again.  That's IF there are queues.  If Blizzard put there talents to good use, you'd have enough people spread out over enough servers where you wouldn't have issues.
---
I'm guessing you just have unrealistic fears because you weren't around during prior expansions or something?  Or you have read horror stories about bad queues?  I assure you those are exaggerated 1000%. And yes literally 1000% because queues were never as long or as lasting as anyone would have you believe.
---
I am telling you, for a fucking fact, while there might be queues on opening day, Blizzard is more than capable of eliminating them completely by day 2 without using layering.

Read the two paragraphs I quoted. They're fucking identical after you revert all the thesaurus crap. "Haven't read the article" my ass.

Honestly can't wait for this. 10 man dungeons sound like a ton of fun. All the fun of raiding but less pressure.
---
Sorry I misremembered, it was actually 36g/hr
---
Still not bad for a passive activity.
---
This is actually really cool.
---
This isn't Kel'Thuzad Horde side is it?
---
It’s true,  although you get soul link you can’t chase people and your damage is weak. SM/Ruin you kill people before they can even reach you.
---
The game is going to be fine.
---
The game is going to be fined.
---
The game is going to be fined? Oh no classic is canceled ahhhh!

I would like more tactical AV. I don't like the Zerg mentality. I want it to be more about capturing the right points killing the right bosses etc.

male were indeed scary, but seeing a female undead priest in shadowform was downright terrifying. since only older lovable moms played female undeads, you know they had just gotten off work and were pissed off enough to go around kicking ass instead of healing.
---
gurubashi arenas
---
Actually I’m really only concerned about having healthy server populations
---
I don't think that you get it.
---
WoW is meant to have servers up to about 3k max population.
---
Let's say that they make a server that holds 15k players, so about 5 layers. They expect about 4/5th of those players to eventually leave, which would leave a healthy 3k server population and enables then to safely get rid of layers.
---
But what if only 5k end up leaving. You're left with 10k active players. So you still decide to remove layers? You now got 10k concurrent players fighting for 3k spots. Players literally can't log in the game anymore.
---
Ah yes, sorry my apologizes I forgot about that, it’s been 15 years since
---
That's a little sad. In vanilla, I was often ganked by the devilsaur while questing through Un'Goro and it was a proud moment when I was finally able to solo one.
---
If they're always camped, then people won't ever be able to experience the danger of Un'Goro.
---
which is funny since troll shadowpriest is arguably better
---
Let take Esfand as example, does he care about not having premade by playing a retribution paladin?
---
Okay but what about my other points other then the arena part?
---
come get more classic shitposts at https://old.reddit.com/r/World_chat/

U gonna die a lot xd
---
This seems highly accurate, what's shitposty about it?
---
I'm planning on multiboxing a group to 60.  At the moment its an alliance Warrior/Priest/Mage/Lock/Hunter group, but that idea seems to change every few days.  The plan so far is to hit 15, and spend the rest of the trek to 60 leveling in dungeons trying to hit them all up except RFC, because forget sneaking in to Orgrimmar for the garbage loot in that instance.  I'm thinking I've done it before and it was never that interesting.  
---
There's a bit of planning going in to it, because there's a lot of travel getting around the world from Deadmines to Wailing Caverns and Blackfathom Depths, and there are a bunch of quest chains that start in out of the way places, so I've got to make sure I'm hitting those up while I'm running around gathering flight paths and the like.
---
ofc a streamer can get a premade lmao, average ret paladin will not
---
is killing someone not the best form of cc

That orc guy at 5:05 had some good lateral movement.
---
WSG is and always will be my favorite BG (no tactics, just a slugfest) but EOTS is a close second. Not exactly a novel idea to just combine WSG with AB but it felt like a game mode that allowed for cool comebacks but also if you’re completely outmatched ends super fast. Loved it
---
This is DPS only. Healers not considered.
---
Troll Mage
---
It was honestly only a short delay in spells. And was a top world healer at the time in a top guild. Ms would effect melee but not healing

That's one, where are the others?

I've done several and I really don't care. Not every artist cares about their artworks getting reposted by someone else, and I'm pretty sure the original artist is one of said chill artists.

An easier solution is to read what interests you and ignore the rest. I don't understand the need to stop a discussion that you have no interest in taking part in.
---
it gets you fed gear and consumes
---
People can overwrite the models in the game. I had all Trolls looking like green/blue Dwarves for almost all of Vanilla. It's even easier today.
---
Technically Blizzard says it's against the EULA, but I've never heard of anyone getting banned for doing it cosmetically.
---
Blood elves ruined the Horde.
---
So this post is 100% about CC and saying killing someone?
---
So you think this is a tier list based completely off of their ability to kill another player? Like I said all classes are better at killing some classes then others. No class is 100% better at killing every class then a different class. It’s purely Rock Paper Scissors.

Forget that.  Buff bots are boring to play and encourage a crappy meta where not only do you need to find a tank and a healer, but a buffer on top.  WoW hit it just right with classes bringing synergy, but still doing their own thing.

Oh well I'll for sure take your word for it instead of the people with the software and servers.  Thanks!
---
So to avoid breaking immersion, your solution will have me fighting mobs that no one else can see?
---
They also create a ton of low level characters, and then kill them all so that they spell out websites.
---
Soul Link is better for AB.  SM Ruin is good for AV and IMO to a lesser extent WSG.
---
Completely depends on the character.
---
Agi Plate gear is useless for a Paladin but highly sought after as a Warrior.
---
sm ruin is a good spec precisely because it's versatile! viable for raiding, great burst in pvp. you wont have the survivability, youll die, but so will everyone else
---
There's a difference between pointing out the bugs and acting like the game is DOA because there are bugs in a beta. Continuing to bring up bugs until they're fixed in a calm manner is great but some people here need to get a grip.
---
The real question is do you level professions before or after epic mount.
---
Sure thing. In classic, ultimately the best gear will be raid gear even for PvP right?

Half the time, they just say "give me lead".

I feel like you're overemphasising your response to this.
---
It would be premature/unreasonable to expect Layering to be in its final/'perfect' state with 2 months still to go. However, they have been quite open and quick to respond with basically every other bug/problem.
---
But Layering is currently the #1 problem the Beta has, in terms of potential for most abuse/damage to the game. And they haven't addressed any concerns, or given any indication of their proposed solutions yet.
---
&gt; Layering is not an issue until it's been a problem for a long time and is there two weeks before launch
---
&gt; and EVEN THEN it's not guaranteed it'll even make it to live that way
---
&gt; and since they did say it'll be gone after a few weeks, sure it's vague but it gives you a clear idea of one fact: it's not here to stay
---
I'm sorry, but this is poor logic/excuses.
---
It is not a good idea to wait until 2 weeks before launch to give criticism to Layering, that's clearly too late for any resolutions.
---
And, yes, everyone knows it's going to be gone. Again, you seem to be overemphasising your response, and not reading verbatim what I'm saying.
---
We need *communication*. They don't need to go into excruciating detail, but they do need to acknowledge there's a problem, and that the Beta version of Layering is not the final solution
---
&gt; but don't yell at blizz for layering a beta if they're testing it out, jesus... Not saying you do obviously, saying people shouldn't.
---
*Yes*, people should! (to the extent of *constructive* criticism)
---
Layering is a very important system. Because it balances population-issues with (potential) damage to the community.
---
So it's very important they get it as close to 'perfect' as possible. And that's less likely to happen unless the community keeps up the (constructive) pressure.
---
And, to reiterate, Blizzard ***have not*** been clear about the plan for layering. It is wrong for anyone to claim they have. And we just need to see some communication at the minimum.
---
-----
---
(also just as a polite heads-up, doing double-line breaks lets you do paragraphs, and it's much easier to read)
---
Let's say, on even gear and buffs, being a streamer doesn't make you a better player than average. There are so many good players (some better than streamers) who do not stream.
---
These are just bfa trolls. They are pro layering because they know its going to fuck with classic.
---
It'll look like a dance off, except people will just suddenly fall over an die for no visible reason.
---
esfand would be 100x more useful on a meta class
---
I imagine that players who are in other layers fighting would appear inactive. 
---
With a huge number of players would you really notice? This is just aimed at the launch when there are a shit ton of people in the same area. This solution makes it so you can see everyone, but dealing with mobs would be a bit of work imagine.
---
I was looking for that Overrated video where they surprise raid the Forgotten heroes on the ZG buff island for that loatheb attempt, but could no longer find it on youtube. If anyone has it somewhere...

Well nobody really thinks the tos is some moral guide. I only care about some parts of the tos because of the threat of being banned (character models and such mostly). 
---
If it causes inflarion, that is on blozzard for not having mechanocs to combat inflation in general, and yeah botting is bad for the game.
---
All iam thinking of right now, is how I shall pick my server; stream free, Pserver autist elitist free. Iam either taking a chance if I want to go right ahead and level, but realizing later on when 30+, that I’ve chosen a toxicmanchildfest of a server. 
---
Or do I wait a day and do some research to see which servers are the popular choice for twitch fanboys.
---
Or do I just don’t give a fuck and play the game...
---
Most likely, or this: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/55002030122-2050040152501051
---
So... instead I'd see a bunch of people standing around doing nothing?
---
That's what youd see if there was no layer or sharding or dynamic respawns isn't it?
---
People move around when they fight.  Mobs do AOE damage at times too.  It sounds way more complicated.
---
Well done
---
The same argument is how we ended up with layering... look how that is turning out. Hype is taking a nose dive.

---
Judgementx and was one of the best heals going around :)
---
Yeah I must hate classic because I haven’t hopped on the layering rage bandwagon
---
I agree that it would be complicated. To play devil's advocate just for the sake of it:
---
Are there mobs with AoE in starting zones? What if you see people moving but just not the spell casting?
---
Ideally you want a tank, healer and 3 dps. I have tried other setups but it didnt work well
---
Casius Human Warrior on Alexstrasza.
---
Shame that you raided so long while fresh 60s and alts that could use it better got dibs on items you wanted though. That should never happen. With dkp it wouldnt have.
---
STOP LIKING WHAT I DONT LIKE REEEEEEE
---
&gt; I mean current AV is just running and capturing a few points with 0 opposition then base racing the other team's Commander.
---
This is still possible in 1.5 AV. Stopping the base rush is also possible in 1.12 AV.
---
Keep frothing at the mouth like the whiny little shit you are.

I’m happy to share.

I am so stoked at the opportunity to relive some of that nostalgia.

Good luck to you on your quest. I hope to see The Hand in your hands someday!
---
Yeah surely - but there are some affixes like leather 'of the Monkey' which are generally super desirable because it hits rogues, hunters, druids, and enh shamans, and some affixes like strength on cloth that are completely useless, right? I'm wondering if anybody has any sort of ranking on these.
---
Yeah world record is 4 days 20 hours, but it's an old one which will definitely be beaten. Not by a rogue tho since they are one of the worst levelers.
---
I hate streamers with a passion. Gaming is cool and all but god damn go get a job
---
I'm sure this won't create a who slew of new problems and will perfectly solve all existing ones.
---
Healing is thankless work, sometimes you just wanna melt a few faces.
---
I played on vanillagaming. I encountered nodes spawning on top of each other on that server FWIW.
---
Perhaps /r/classicwow needs to introduce layering?
---
I’m going for Tauren hunter. Taming my pink flamingo asap. Then I plan to level without a guide, running all dungeons at least once, keeping herbalism/skinning/fishing/cooking up to date as I level. Can’t wait to be hunting in huge treed forests like Feralas and Un’goro. Hits me hard right in the feels.
---
I still believe Ulduar was the highest point of WoW PvE design. Raid Progression still exists. Heroic Ulduar pretty much existed by virtue of hard modes. Some wacky builds existed during the Ulduar patch, like Frostfire mage. It was a great time.
---
Pretty sure Power Word: Shield stopped warrior rage generation as well, so it generally was a bad idea to cast it on the tank
---
It all adds up but I still don’t trust your math for some reason.
---
It starts autoattack if you can complete the action. Like if you cast HS or MS and you can actually cast it (ie you have rage) you will start autoattacking. If you can't cast it you won't start autoattacking. Some people prefer it either way.
---
Rule 1.
---
So you’re saying it took us that long cuz we sucked?!!!!
---
*pointless outrage ensues*
---
The key to long battles is simply fighting instead of rushing the other boss. You can significantly stall progress with roughly 1/3 of your group hanging back. And even just a dedicated group of players going around recapping towers will do it.
---
Life is what you make it

This is equally as terrible as your other post.

And if they are on the wrong team, I can't even kill them?
---
Tauren warrior...and I was horde.
---
Bah okay fine it was a bad idea, thanks for the comments everyone!
---
this is for classic wow shitposting
---
Clearly you missed the massive uproar over thousands of people being banned only a few months ago for client side model editing their characters.
---
I got told recently the reason I'm getting threat as a priest is because I don't have threat reduction talents. I played a tank for 6 years and didn't even know I could use that excuse.
---
For a troll like you, I usually choose to ignore it.
---
that's a big arguably
---
I fully believe that a few months after Classic launch they will start making tweaks and adjustments across the board. I highly doubt they are just going to rehash all content releases exactly how they were at the time they hit.
---
I think instead, going forward they will release content but with their own bug fixes and tweaks, sticking with the spirit of classic wow, but aiming for a perfected version.
---
Those 5 extra points translate to about 3-5% more DPS (assuming you're a swords rogue, or war). No other racial besides Bloodfury can give you a boost like that. But sword spec uptime is 100% so it's very valuable.
---
I can see it now. Server first onyxia bout to go down. Onyxia shouts layer me not unlike some people have been doing and she just up and disappears. Bonus points if she trash talks the raid she ran from. Then again maybe that's where ragnaros was summoned by domo from in the vanilla days. He was just being layered through time to assist with the bigass gank domo was experiencing...my mind has been blown.
---
I would never join a causal guild that used LC. I would never join a hardcore progression guild using DKP. They are systems better suited for a purpose. If your purpose is the kill everything first, then LC is great and probably in a guild that will do main runs and an alt run, more than enough loot for all. I was in guilds that used DKP and EP/GP and they aren't bad systems. I personally liked DKP better since you had more control of your upgrade path unlike when I felt I had to grab any upgrade I could otherwise, even when it was barely better than what I had than try and get the biggest upgrade possible. Not that DKP didn't have the problems people talk about, even though I would say letting shit rot is an exaggeration, it did happen but I personally found rarely since always some new people who need shit and new players will go into the hole for days.
---
That playlist teleported me back to 2005
---
How were fire mages in vanilla anyway? I've been a frost mage for almost as long as I played the game.
---
I remember trying out fire while leveling and it was burst damage city but I went back to frost because it was way less stressful.
---
Oh, I don't know. AV, unarmoured mounts and the EU servers being set up to fail?
---
I don't really want to talk about stuff to be honest. I'd like to just trust that they'll do a good job and do something else with my life for two months, but they're making it difficult.
---
Your healers were fucking dicks lmao
---
How about them talking amoung the guild and asking for you to MT until the guy gets geared up again, instead of just throwing a mutiny, holy crap.
---
You're either dumb or didn't watch the video/ever play wow. You could always ice block with flag (to block incoming damage, remove snares or roots, etc) and then instantly cancel block and repick. zzzz
---
Yes you can?  I wasn't even the only one in my guild that didn't have/use a mic.
---
This wouldn't really make a difference in the main objective of layering which is for performance reasons in high density areas. It becomes exponentially expensive when you have more players in a designated area.
---
We had dkp (but in rare instances things would be loot counseled) and no alts or fresh 60s got things before me because we never lost raiders and everyone always showed up.  Sometimes we'd let alts run, but they never got items over someone's main.  I just remember a lot of hunters needing zin'rokh before they got anything better as well as most of the warriors.  I enjoyed my guild immensely.  I can't wait to get back to this game raiding end game content.
---
*ding*
---
So we had this guild leader who was also the MT.  Normal enough guy, pushed us hard and we were server first for all the main raids MC/BWL/AQ (big fish in a small pond) on Zuluhed US (zuludead).  He got all of us to grind him the AQ scepter and do all that.  Sure, fine, we had to open the gates anyways and why not?
---
Issue was he loved to win.  While we were server first and stomping any competition (there was no competition on a dead server lol), he was happy, but then we hit Naxx.  We cleared one wing before the constant hardcore grind of classic started to get to people.  People started flaking out, not showing up and then we started sliding.  We started to not get enough to clear the bosses we had already done, and it just got worse each week.
---
Without telling anyone, our guild leader passed leadership to a random officer, transferred servers and used our guild bank (which only he was allowed to hold on his alts, of course) to buy a spot on a raiding team for a top 10 US guild.  Never heard whatever happened to him, but the guild broke apart within the day and I have never done hardcore raiding since.
---
I'm never going to use it but I don't see how it would change anything as people who want voice comms will use it regardless.
---
Admitting when you're wrong is a sign of evolution. Good on you for that
---
Oh, you mean those bans that were all reversed?
---
stop whiteknighting. Blizzard will NEVER acknowledge your existence.
---
Can people stop complaining about racism, it's getting old
---
Sheeeeeesh get over it already
---
That doesn't mean you're not wrong.
---
I have no opinion.
---
The retail vanilla audience knew they were playing a borked game and wanted fixes, that is for certain. The question is whether when t the tourists have left Classic whether the remaining player base will be #nochanges cultists, or more like the real vanilla crowd from 2006.
---
Which is why don't play Alliance scum
---
Without talking a bout the benefits of this solution, there's one big reason it's a bad idea: It would take a long time for Blizzard to implement. Getting rid of layers would be the best, or at least making layers 100% independent from one another, but this would require way too much overhead to even be worth considering.
---
We have Westfall and Elwynn Forrest. It's close enough.
---
The loot council for one bleeding edge guild I was in used a loot council that was 2 officers and 3 normal raiders that rotated weekly. Very transparent, but can also be very slow. Also unless the item upgrade was obviously huge for someone, most of the time it would just go round robin around based on who hasnt received loot the longest.
---
Better pvp balance and arena gives max level in tbc a lot of replayability for PVPers.
---
lol @ solid retadin
---
The difference here is that layering will eventually cease to exist
---
So now we have vanilla players, usually at the end of the "nostalgia" argument, calling out other people on "nostalgia"?
---
Atleast sknelne is thinking of ideas good on ya mate unfortunately j think it will cause more problems
---
Trust me ist Not worth it to read storys of your gay guildleader fucking hairy croatian guys in full Details in the officers chat while raiding Black temple
---
which pserver are these on?
---
I mean it sounds like you have your information already. Just look at the stat orders for each class if you don't already know them and go off of that. If you happen to land a cloth with Int/Spirit it will be any cloth user. Not much to really rank.
---
zzz
---
Guy in my guild faked his own death.

While leveling:

You want "spirit + main stat" items for the best solo leveling speed. But you also want some stam gear too.

For example "spirit + Agi" mail gear is very nice for warrior level as it makes the leveling process much smoother for the warrior (but you also want some stam gear to survive like double pulls)
---
But when doing group dungeons while leveling, then you dont want spirit gear but instead "double main stat" or "main stat + stam".
---
That's the beauty of classic wow, there's a variety of bis gear for different occasions and it just depends what you need.
---
no oceanic servers might as well stick to playing on shitty pservers.
---
you use seal of the crusader for judging it at the start of a fight
---
and again, why can't they just create their own guilds for their country/language??????????????
---
there is no issue here.
---
I found alchemy/herbalism really rewarding. I liked having to go around all across azeroth to collect the mats for my potions. Then again I was a super casual player who never really even tried to get black lotus.
---
Fix the balance issues, improve UI, then reset.
---
Jesus this is amazing
---
and why should Germany get it's own server?
---
why cant they create german guilds and recruit germans?
---
Since when does Germany qualify as the ONLY EU country that deserves its own server?
---
There is no issue.
---
I'm concerned though...
---
I love TBC (where I started) but will they do \#nochanges TBC?  And if so, will they do \#nochanges WotLK?  And if so, will they do \#nochanges Cata?  Would they make entirely new servers for each expansion to keep them pristine (which you could do a one-time character copy onto) or would they force updates to change TBC into WotLK, then WotLK into Cata?  Either you split the player base into many new servers (some Vanilla, some TBC, some WotLK, some Cata) or they make some into temporary experiences as each new expansion completely replaces the previous.
---
I don't know how likely it is, but I'd honestly prefer if they circumvented this andmade an alternate universe TBC (on new servers that you could copy a character onto) that is similar, but with a few improvements.  Then carry those "Classic+" servers into further expansions that may share some similarities with the other expansions but maintain the core design philosophies that existed in Vanilla.
---
That way you'd have "Pure Vanilla" Classic servers that permanently keep the original game available to play, and "Classic+" servers that take the game forward in a direction similar to TBC with future expansions maintaining that original Vanilla philosophy in a way that the other expansions failed to.
---
I\` d pay real good money for a gfx revamp of WoW to make it look like this. And i mean a shit ton of money. Classic+ this. Divorce will probably soon be next :)
---
cool orc, not thrall.
---
I hate the zerg mentality retail fosters ... 
---
i would like to to see the longer version of AV and felt it was tactical and fun, it felt like a real war was being waged and you always knew where to go if you wanted to be apart of it.
---
&gt; It just felt like your typical linear single player game instead of an open world.
---
You are describing Catacylsm.
---
Renegade, male night elf rogue
---
And there's a lot of people that don't care about Classic and just want BC. For all the issues you bring up with BC a BC fan cam bring up and an equally longer list of Vanilla problems. Be happy people want legacy whether it's Vanilla or BC. It creates that community you want.
---
you eat your own shit as well I take it...
---
Guild was pretty hard core, we weren't server first or anything but pretty close (within the top10 to 20 usually) and most of us lived/breathed wow.
---
The guild leader brought in his priest wife to the raid dropping a long running priest, she was beyond hopeless and I think she only wanted to play to spend time with him, we carried her through most of AQ 40 but were hitting the stone wall of Twin-Emps and after many, many, many, attempts for the first time since we formed (just before BWL opened) we fell out of the top 20 on the server.
---
The Loot-Master was the guild's 2nd in command and he and the GM shared MT/OT for the majority of fights, both him and the GM had one half of the bindings when the second half dropped, the GM was first in line with DKP by a lot and pretty much assumed it was his to get as did most of the guild telling him gratz etc.
---
The Loot-Master (2nd in command) then just said in Vent: "Ok everyone its time to say goodbye" he took the bindings and without another word 30 members of the raid dropped from both vent and the guild within 15 seconds, then another 60ish people dropped form the guild.
---
The rest of us kind of just sat there, we had no idea what was happening, the GM started baby raging (he was a 30+ year old man) chucking a mega fit,to which I can only compare to my now 6 month old kid when he is getting a tooth.
---
Those of us not in the know got a fairly nicely worded but weird whisper from the Loot Master afterwards explaining what had happened as well as an invite to the new guild, apparently for months (since the GM's wife joined us in raiding) they had been planning this once they got a good drop.
---
He went on to say how he and the other class leaders tried for months to get him to drop his wife, as she was the reason we couldn't keep up anymore, the GM flaunted his power basically egging them on, telling them that it was his guild and while they were under his roof they would respect his choices etc.
---
The LootMaster went on to explain that the class leaders and him were the only ones originally in the know of the plan, but someone spilled the beans and a few more people found out, so from their they all agreed to stop telling people and just quit when the time came for a big  dramatic f\*\*k you drop to the GM.
---
The new guild was called "His Roof" (as a stab at the GM) it didn't do anything or last long as drama follows dramatic people, looking back now it actually saved my life as I was burning myself way to hard on wow, my school results and social life was tanking way too hard.
---
I was a pretty good AH goblin in BFA (the only reason I even have game time is because I have so much money that I can just buy game tokens). I plan on doing the same in classic WoW.
---
I hope there will be a classic version of TSM but I kinda hope not so I can just make my own addon and have a leg up on the majority of other players.
---
Breakdown.
---
S Tier: "Hunter weapon" hunters.  Is there really any other class? You get all the best gear and all you have to do is say hunter weapon, no need to worry about trying to /roll
---
A Tier: Warriors with priests healing them.
---
B Tier: Mages
---
Flag running tier: Druids
---
C Tier: Rogues and Shaman  
---
Healing Tier: Priests and Paladins  
---
D Tier: Hunters - They start out great but they have scaling problems in late vanilla
---
E Tier: Tseric - Same problem as hunters but you could also get fired.
---
F Tier: Warriors
---
Literally Hitler Tier: DPS Paladins  
---
Pain and Tour Tier: Rogues camping your low level
---
Mushroom Tier: Warlocks.
---
It turned hybrids not into hybrids? You're clueless.   You don't consider such, but others do. Your opinion is not fact. Get that through your thick skull.
---
&gt; Easier said than done.
---
Probably easier done than said actually. Sharding already works like that. They didn't really need to do anything to make it work that way.
---
I will actually suck your dick for this in 5160x1440
---
Don't ask me why
---
10/10
---
this is good shit right here.... grade A+
---
Lol server first what? First pug?
---
Another solution would be to have no layering.
---
- everyone is all together 
---
- in the same place 
---
- at the same time 
---
- doing the same quests
---
because in a massive multiplayer online game we want massive amounts of multiple players.
---
Umm no. You're ignorant. Druids were healers.  Only once AQ hit did we see druids even remotely shine. Please research because it's questionable if you played Vanilla or BC.
---
certainly doesn't offer any damage mitigation compared to warden staff
---
This is exactly something I was curious about. Great work and thank you. 
---
I plan on rolling Druid and figured there were some tips and tricks like this.
---
I will make a video as enhancement with Might of Menethil and lottery people. Screencap this as you are all witness...
---
I was part of the shit show they had during the stress tests ..... I can assure you the first one was unplayable.
---
Zone got blighted everyone died
---
To exploit layering to the fullest
---
Check out u/ChromedDragon's posts for examples.
---
NS its not bad for pvp. However, if you gear properly with the 14/32/5 spec, you will hit like a truck when you crit, and your bleeds will tick hard otherwise. 14/32/5 is just better for world pvp because of grasp, omen, lotp, and shapeshifter. Yes, you can heal better with the NS spec, but you will hit 10% harder, with 3% more crit, and when you get an omen proc on an opener... its nuts. You'll also be able to move in and out of forms much easier with the 30% reduction. It allows you to focus less on int and more on strength, causing you to hit like a truck.
---
I can't give you an exact amount of int to aim for, but once you have enough that you don't feel mana starved its time to focus on strength... and stam (though you should have enough stam through your pvp set and bg rewards) 
---
The playstyle needs you to be able to shift from bear to cat and back throughout the fight to keep bleeds up and still survive/tank, while tossin a hot or two in there etc... I feel like I prioritize my stats str&gt;int/stam&gt;agil, but generally speaking, once you have enough int and you feel like your survivability is good its just str&gt;agil. Though, its important to keep in mind that str is 2:1 atp while agil is 1:1 atp... So there are definitely isntances where the agil piece may have enough agil that your attack power gain is high enough.

Around 2008, me and my cousin where hitting a stride in BC and decided to find a guild. We found a pretty great one with other people learning like us and becoming a pretty tight knit group. We wound becoming great friends with a hunter who knew the GM in real life. Great guy and hilarious, but the GM was... off. Could never put my finger on it. Well one day I log on and everyone's getting kicked and the GM is ranting in guild chat about how evil everyone was. The typing was awful son I'm pretty sure he was drunk.
---
Turns out my hunter bro found out that the GM was cheating on his wife with some girl in the guild and spilled all the beans to the Mrs. He was a "no fucks given" kind of dude and just pulled the trigger with zero remorse. Everyone that was kicked out met in Stormwind to make a new guild, vote for a new leader, and officers and keep it alive. Never saw that GM or girl online again and raided for years with the guild and that badass hunter bro of mine. 
---
I asked him sometime later what happened to the GM and he caught me up. Apparently they worked together and after he found out he let everyone know what a piece of shit he was and the GM quit shortly after. Hunter bro never saw him again and couldn't care less. 
---
Amazing times.
---
Or he could go fuck himself. I don't give a shit. Why the hell do you? Why would anyone feel sorry for him? He makes a living streaming video games. If he doesn't like how streaming affects his video game experience, he can go stream Fortnite or something and play WoW on his own time. This isn't something that any of us should care about.
---
period
---
I suppose a lot of the TBC experience has to do with already being level 60 when it launches. We would not get that if they made new servers for TBC. Then what happens if we want to play TBC? Goodbye progress? I think each server would have to be split: either you stay in Classic or you move to TBC.
---
I'm not sure how this is relevant... They've been using layering since the beta started.
---
Please stop plagiarizing other people's work and putting it up on your planned gold selling site.

/u/SoupaSoka can we ban this domain already? It definitely goes against Reddit's self-promotion rules and violates this sub's rule #4.

I'd have to see your 8/22/21 build, but that sounds similar to the junk soda plans to run. You literally wont be "good" at any facet of druid play with that spec. You'll rely totally on kiting, and you will never score kills against competent players, especially not in group fights, or 1v2/3/4 situations. Technically speaking, you could still play that same playstyle as 14/32/5 without insect swarm... while insect swarm is decent damage, its not like you wreck with it. There's just alot more fun and effective ways to play druid. I personally dont like moonkin, but i'd still play that over the 8/22/21 build.
---
now in WSG flag running.... the 30/21 spec would probably be supreme... but you can still run them as 14/32/5.. and you can also be on flag recovery duty. I never had a problem throughout my rank grind as 14/32/5. I would consider 30/21 for WSG only if it weren't for 50g respec costs.
---
its going to be completely different now that people know how to actually pvp.
---
Skinning while leveling for a Xtra vendor cash and alch
---
Drop skinning at Max level (or near it) for engi
---
so in pvp certain instant skill proc reckoning when you are /sitting in pvp but to guarantee everything procs reckoning in classic wow you have to /sit then /stand at the right time ? Is that how it works now ?
---
For some reason fury doesn’t appeal to me as much. I mained a warrior offtank through classic and BC. Fury dps is fun and I know the class well but maybe it’s time to try something new. 
---
I had hand of rag and cleared part of AQ40 and Naxx in classic but if I can’t MY then I’m interested in a new class.
---
Good bot
---
This hits the nail on the head i think. The only thing tbc didnt improve was the somewhat intangible grandness of the whole world.
---
Perhaps thats just an inescapable property of an expansion vs a brand new game. /shrug
---
Not only will it slap her ass, it'll prolly kill her, too.
---
Someone else pointed out gbid, sometimes called GDKP. Basically a bidding system using gold all paid to the RL, then at the end of the raid the gold is distributed between all the raiders. Some guilds/people would take a % cut for organizing it before splitting the gold up. But it's a decent system. Even if you're not rich enough to win a lot of items, you get a good chunk of gold at the end.
---
So is it raising the max level you can train swords, or does it give an invisible +5 so whatever level you are, it's as if you had 5 more levels? I had no idea training weapons added that much dps.
---
Holy shit...
---
How does it work for later raids? Is the list done in its totality before Raid 1 overall, or each raid?
---
I ask because I never hit 40 as a kid and am pretty limited in knowledge of what I’d be going for.
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/batching
---
Batching would mean processing the spells "in a batch" with no regard for the side effects of other spells in the batch. 
---
So that code is not even remotely close to how batching, any implementation of batching, would work.
---
Sounds right
---
Careful. In Thailand much like in-game it can be difficult to tell female nelfs from male nelfs.

There is nothing Classic about WOTLK

&gt; Elemental Water: Again with the protection potions, you wont be using these until naxx, good luck making gold with it when you have to literally wait almost 1.5 years, should've touched on another method instead, but it seems like the guide likes to spew out common sense things, that everybody should know, just to make it longer and seem important for gold making.
---
If only every single mage had to farm elemental water for their BIS chest piece until ZG patch.. hmm.

GM: 40yr old something dude, lives in canada.

GM's GF (officer): 40yr old something girl, lives in canada with BF.
---
My sister: 20yr old something girl, live in MO USA.
---
Me: 12 year old girl, lives in MO USA.
---
GM's GF (whispering my sister): did you come up to canada to fuck my BF???
---
My sister: ???? I'm married??? (her husband was in guild too)
---
GM's GF (whispering ME): I bet you hopped a bus up to canada just to fuck my bf, I'm gonna gkick you too. (kicks me)
---
GM: Loses his shit on entire guild, drives down to USA to my sister's house (had address for gift exchange during xmas) shows up at her front door cussing her out. (I didn't live with her)
---
GM's GF: (blasts me and my sister on trade chat, mind you community was SUPER important back then.)
---
Turns out he was sleeping with a totally different girl IRL that had nothing to do with the game.
---
Yeah, &lt;Tyana&gt; Moonrunner was FUN!
---
Yea, you're probably right. I just hated the old system LOL. I'm probably just lazy though
---
Yeah i completely agree, lets keep things civilized.
---
Things dont translate well from a "screw you dev" perspective anyways.
---
Little confused as to where you got all your info on layering tho. There haven't been any such statements made as of yet. We don't know what they are testing and how many layers will be at launch, and henceforth. We know they are planning to remove layering by the time phase 1 hits. But thats it.
---
Right now the only source material we have on the layering system is the beta. Untill blizzard actually details whats going on behind the scenes, the beta is what people will base their perception on. I hope that since all the exploiting and  immersion breaking footage we have seen well get some sort of response from the developers as to how they plan to deal with all this. I think itll help with calming people down knowing that they are being heard.
---
You just contradicted yourself. There is nothing to research I played Classic, then witnessed what Blizzard did to classes like druids and paladins in the expansion. Druids and paladins were not weak in Vanilla. They were hybrid classes that could be played and utilized in many ways. You make some dumb argument about how these classes couldn't tank the hardest bosses in Classic, therefore their design was flawed. The developers intended it that way, until they dumped down the classes down, and removed the RPG traits of the classes in TBC. Just as they did away with so many other features in Classic to make way for players like you.
---
Yeah I know, grinding Black Temple for 6 months and chasing resto druids around pillars in PvP is riveting stuff. Or you could just skip all that and fly around the purple skies.
---
Can't say the ones I will use but had a lock named warlockimus
---
All I am trying to demonstrate is that Blizz might actually have technical limitation. Some of proposed solution may sound great on paper but could be very difficult to implement. 
---
We don't know why Blizz decided to go from something they have readily available like sharding to something like layering where they may not have as much experience. There must be a reason. We just don't know it.
---
100%. Horde was never the same. Half the horde players base was playing an Elf class. Idiotic.
---
Why are you so confident that this record will be beaten?
---
How can you say that TBC arena was balanced? Is that nostalgia talking? Are you forgetting the war/lock/druid cancer that spread through early seasons.
---
I think you should take a look at how OSRS has progressed. There’s been mostly horizontal and some vertical progression, and it’s been really well done.
---
There would be plenty of ways for a Classic WoW+ to do the same. The issue might be that (as I understand it) most people won’t clear Naxx, so some work will be necessary in rebalancing the six month grind to get geared etc.
---
For instance if you had new raids that served as stepping stones to Naxx and other difficult horizontal difficulty raids to Maxx, that would allow for it. 
---
But I’m no WoW expert like I (regrettably) am when it comes to OSRS.
---
yeah, I'm following you on this one
---
Super interesting what you're saying about strength there - wouldn't have expected that. Thanks for the input.
---

Was the other user pointing out your [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5jjy8/10_most_memorable_maps_in_wow_classic/es27a2t/?context=3) also trolling?
---
Hopefully the #nochangers dial it back. Change is not bad. I think launching the game as close to 1.12 as possible is a great idea, but making no changes going forward would be super detrimental to the health of the game
---
I am planning on still playing as having played a large amount of content both before and after cata (including vanilla/tbc) the pre cata  style of questing and content in general is much more enjoyable for me.
---
In vanilla I never got past level 40 so I am really looking forward to experiencing all the 40+ content that I missed
---
It's not that much different for ret or warrior.
---
&gt; This isn't something that any of us should care about.
---
You seem to care quite a bit about this topic.
---
Of all the “how to fix Layering” posts, this is by far the stupidest one.
---
Undead anything. Undead seems to attract players that lack empathy. In contrast Tauren players tend to be passive.
---
Not totally "drama", but hilarious and gross none the less.
---
Picture this. It's burning crusade launch month. GM is an older woman (think 60+), new guy in guild is a fresh 17yr old boy. Typical teen boy is THIRSTY!! He's hitting on every girl, even 14 year old me, just to see who hits back. 60yoGM is cougar af, she takes the bait. They hit it off, exchange pics, he gets grossed out after realizing how old she is.
---
She offers to pay for his epic flying (5k) AND his plane ticket if he flies up to canada to fuck her.
---
He does it.
---
He, and she, openly admit it in guild chat. It was unbelievable at first, but they sent us a selfie of them together in person, kind of had to believe it at that point. (He was topless and she was in a bra)
---
I'm actually lol'ing
---
My first character was a NE Hunter named Paku. Got to level 17 before I logged out at Vanilla launch.
---
OK, this clarifies the yellow hit/weapon skill interaction quite a bit.
---
To make yellow hits not miss as a combat rogue:
---
Take 5 points in precision, 2 points in weapon expertise, and get 1% hit from gear
---
To make yellow hits not miss as a non-human, non-combat rogue with 5 points in precision:
---
Take 5 points of precision and get 4% hit from gear
---
To make yellow hits not miss as a human non-combat rogue with 5 points in precision:
---
Take 5 points of precision and get 1% hit through gear (i.e. being human allows you to skip weapon expertise if using swords)
---
To make yellow hits not miss as a human non-combat rogue with 0 points in precision:
---
Get 6% hit through gear
---
To make yellow hits not miss as a non-human non-combat rogue with 0 points in precision:
---
Get 9% hit through gear
---
This is great - awesome to know the soft cap for hit for each possible talent/race combination.
---
Not nearly to the extent of Wrath. Wrath could have been better if it had remained closer to TBC, Vanilla is great but TBC is that sweet spot between both.
---
Wow youre so wisw! What do you think it is?
---
Im guessing youve never played bfa either bc with an addon the loot is so fast that you dont see the items at the cursor before its in your inventory so you are literally wrong bro
---
how do we know blizz will remove it as they said? 
---
if realm pop is still huge a month in they wont be able to remove it as zones will be massively overpopulated, not enough herb/ore nodes etc.
---
10k+ like nost on a realm designed for 3k is not fun imo
---
After the Spanish inquisition
---
Going hunter and still deciding on what pet I want. Might to a boar to start with til I can get a wolf or cat I like. For professions going either herb/alchemy or skinning/lw. Making gear would be nice but so are having potions so idk yet. Alt, maybe Druid ? Shall see 😀 can’t wait either way 💕
---
That was WotLK.
---
I’m down
---
raided with Ruth after she came to oceanic servers after all this happened and the drama continued. She was actually married the whole time as well
---
We must go deeper, layer the players and the mobs so no one can see anything. human vs orc war ends and everyone lives.
---
Yup Shadow Priest, Warlocks, Mages. They’re all too good in world pvp.
---
Because we’ve gotten a lot better at the game in 10 years.
---
Even Joana agrees his record is going to get obliterated on launch week.

This one is rarely mentioned.

Youre there, you can roll. Thats it. Nothing else.

Honestly any Horde player would absolutely trash me, no competition. They were all scary because I'd be equally dead in any circumstance.
---
I mained a dress-wearing holy paladin. Totally useless outside of raiding, but it's not like there was a better option for vanilla paladins. My best bet was to beg for mercy and hope the opposing player felt bad about it.
---
aw man you made me think of our old guild mom auntmartha, always went out of her way to say hello when you logged on ;_;

Bearhoof, the Tauren feral druid.

Shadowpriests didn’t scare me as an Imp CS  mage.

I remember hearing somewhere that it was originally planned that it was going to be a BG, similar to AV but ended up being cut from Cata. I imagine is what probably happened, is most the work that went into in ended up being part of Tol Barad and the current Gilneas BG we know of today.
---
Haha you must have been one of the little haters who I smashed on. Sorry buddy
---
Asscandy
---
I mean ud sp and orc wl are the #2 and #1 best 1v1 setups in the game, everything else is personal bias.
---
Some of the best times I had was with the burning Crusade. Some of their lands were simply beautiful. And my drani hunter was nothing short os a bad ass.
---
Even as a Horde player I must admit this is magnificent.
---
You're really not supposed to beat a sp as a mage though unless you get lucky and they sit a poly into at least 2x crits...but again were asking them to not push buttons...
---
This was during MoP, but...
---
I was in a guild that struggled to even take out the Stone Guard in MV. They tried doing it on 25 man, and even had formed 10 man groups. My group had success, and eventually built up through ToT. Later, they couldn't even defeat Jin'rokh in ToT. They tried to micromanage us, and even tried to plant officers in our runs. They acted like they were great, but we're pretty inept. It took one of their officers months to realize we weren't donating the rare-quality (blue) mats to the gbank. We already furnished out own mats,
---
Yeah right.
---
This needs to get fixed.  I hope Beta folks have given feedback on this.
---
Perseo - Human Paladin, played him till WOTLK and then switched to Tauren Warrior.

I feel you. Female human mages were always trolling and wrecking

Perhaps with outsider help it will get smashed, yeah.

Just FYI agil is not worthless on paladin for leveling, it's better than strength. 
---
While leveling it takes too much strength to reach a breakpoint of "hits to kill" that it isnt worth stacking. Stacking agility takes much less to reach "hits to kill" breakpoints. Also with stacked agility you can have lucky strings of crits that you massive change breakpoints as well, oh and you'll take less damage because of the "defense" you get from stacking strength too.
---
I agreed with you until this:
---
&gt; and from what we know cross faction collusion will not be allowed
---
Classic WoW is not going to have a separate EULA from Retail.
---
I wish there was a pure, hardcore Mage leveling guide.
---
Joana's guide has other class tabs for like, through level 10.
---
His guide is written through a Hunter, since he is using that as is everyone else legit going for world first. So a lot of his strats become a lot fucking harder when you can't reliably fight mobs three levels higher than you like a Hunter can.
---
I've seen streamers saying yeah, Joana has a decent baseline, but it's negated by the fact that he is writing it only through a Hunter's perspective, and apparently isn't as tune with more recent speed strats.
---
Love it!
---
 username doesn't checkout haha
---
Have you thought about Engineering/Leatherworking and just buying the mats?
---
There were almost no speedrunners back in Vanilla so Joana didn't have much competition, and could hold the WR with a lot of things still left to optimize. Nowadays speedrunning is much bigger and people have been practicing the game for 15 years. Joana himself expects him to crush his record with a ~4d5h time and does believe others will do it faster than him.
---
I couldn't find any clip of him talking about it, but he mentions it like once a stream since people ask.
---
Jewelcrafting? Always felt like that fit well. Except maybe only 1 - 2 slots at most
---
What server were you on?
---
I linked three other guides, all of which work really well for any class.
---
Just browse through them all and take from them what you will...
---
It won't. End of story.
---
Stop over analyzing testing you have no clue what's going on.
---
Cross-server BGS are still confirmed to be in.
---
1.12 AV is still confirmed to be in.
---
Nah that’s Old meta.
---
I hit r12 on popular private server and decked out mages simply beat spriest 1v1.
---
Imp CS just ends duels, they literally can’t do anything for 10 seconds every 15 seconds and they have 1800+ Fbolts incoming.
---
The hook so fast a poly/manapot/managem /eco destroys.
---
Only thing I couldn’t beat as a mage 1v1 consistently was an SL Lock.
---
They could fill multiple roles theoretically, but in practice were extremely inefficient if even able. You could take with a paladin, but it would take for fucking ever, and bosses with enrages would be almost impossible without an immense amount of gear compared to just face rolling it with a warrior. At least TBC gave you the ability to do it. Hybrids felt WAY more hybrid; ele shamans would go partway into resto after going deep ele, pallies would dip into all trees, etc; and while they were able to do any of their available roles they were far worse than the “pures” (but still essential for buffs and assist).
---
2008 guides aren't exactly relevant. The problem is, I know discussing with pserver/certain streamers there are newer guides out there, but they aren't going to disclose them until they hit 60. 
---
I mean seriously, no offense, but the power level in 2 weeks guide is like, the most non-descript thing ever. I'm talking Joana like details, but updated for an Alliance Mage that is the most optimal.
---
Additionally, not only is legacywow's a ripoff of Joana's as he addressed on stream recently, but it's not nearly as detailed as Joana's is.
---
Would you be able to explain to me how spirit works for soloing? I never thought it was important to be honest and it seems like I'm so wrong
---
I'm fairly confident that the strafing bug is just a result of missing animation frames for the "head tilt" that happens on retail when you target a mob.
---
the code cant find the missing frames so it just defaults to the t pose frames.
---
should be fairly simple to fix.
---
Dizzle, male troll priest
---
Classic is a better game
---
But but. There is this teeny tiny little voice that whispers in the back of my head. "What if it's not"
---
- beta posting is actually cancer
---
- there are many valid concerns about layering
---
- eu servers are a valid concern (polish is a strawman, but I'm guessing you're being facetious)
---
- sub isn't expensive for any normal adult, but at the same time I don't see why it's that much without them making new content
---
- old AV was indeed sick
---
- idk about this one, people shit on streamers here more often than not
---
I’ll be legitimately happy if it all goes well.
---
Now do it without crop
---
Moowoocow
---
We're getting the BFA version of AV, aka 1.12.
---
Blizzard REFUSES to listen to all feedback on 1.12 AV being a gigantic mistake.
---
In my personal opinion TBC and Wrath was when WOW was already popular so a lot of ppl had a chance to see/clear a lot of that content.
---
With Vanilla a lot of ppl started very late and did not get a chance to see a lot. Plus getting gear and clearing things takes much longer in vanilla.
---
Lol. Shame!!!
---
I think a big reason is that everyone rolls Horde. People love blood elves, and the Horde are just better in TBC.
---
I would expect that sometime after Classic releases, you'll see a rise in popularity for TBC servers. Any vanilla server worth a damn is shutting down once Classic releases.
---
People are still gonna want a nostalgic trip down memory lane that costs $0. I think TBC is gonna be that.
---
Nice
---
Eight minute rush fests because we're getting 1.12 AV.
---
Yeah, OP didn't think this idea through enough. This was literally the first thing I thought of after reading his idea.
---
You can still report players though, right? Just not through that function.
---
Agi gives criti, crit procs vengeance for deep ret, which most leveling paladins will be.
---
Very few want to spend time doing ANYTHING in Vanilla that's slow. 
---
This is how WoW got the state it's currently in with retail.
---
Yeah. Buy again, in my head skinning goes really well with a hunter as a gatherer class. I know it’s not optimal at 60, but I am goong to play for my own enjoyment not minmaxing..
---
That is accurate, melee range on auto attacks is larger than your abilities, it was very pronounced when chasing people as i had to hope for a crippling poison proc so i could use abilities.
---
in the pserver scene vanilla and wotlk have had the most development.
---
most pserver projects dont share their data/cores.
---
Netherwing TBC has been successful recently
---
There is one in dire maul also
---

---
Cut of a head and two more heads appear! Hail Hydra!
---
U'd be surprised how many don't tbh, most of the guides online are garbage tbh.
---
Due to layer hopping there will be a much higher flow of mats in the game and since the auction house isn't affected by layering then a higher supply will result in massive price drops across the board.
---
Mate if you find yourself in an empty Orgrimmar during the first week of launch because you're in some horrible undeveloped and untested layer implementation I'll buy you a month of game time.
---
By far the scariest combo, everyone else is wrong
---
TBC was a good expansion but to me is lesser than vanilla for two main reasons. Flying, and trivializing almost the entire world. It feels bad to have the whole of Azeroth be insignificant.
---
&gt; I suppose a lot of the TBC experience has to do with already being level 60 when it launches. We would not get that if they made new servers for TBC.
---
The 'standard' for what people expect in either new Classic+ content or for TBC would be for them to launch new servers (to keep Classic Vanilla pristine) but to allow a one-time character copy service that would copy all your characters over to the new TBC/Classic+ server.  That would allow people who want to play Vanilla to continue to do so without issues (which is half of what Classic is about, preserving the game as it was), but also allow people to progress into additional content.  I think there's very little chance that they do anything but this for new content whether it's Classic+ or TBC.
---
But what I'm saying is that if they do that for TBC (new servers that you can copy everything over to) then at the end of TBC, do they do it for WotLK?  Then for Cata?  The population would get divided more and more with each expansion.  Or would they keep the pristine Vanilla servers (because you can copy all your characters/progress/stuff over to TBC servers once) but then force updates on the TBC servers to become WotLK, then to become Cata, and on and on?
---
What I was saying above is that the best solution for this is to *not* have \#nochanges TBC, but to keep pristine Vanilla servers and make "Classic+" servers (that you copy onto) which would then progress into new expansions, with the first one being very similar to TBC but diverging more and more into entirely new content over time.
---
&gt; They did it by having 3 weapons and rolling 3 ranks of deadly poison with shiv.
---
Shiv only existed in Burning Crusade btw. Where it was a well-documented fact that Poisons scaled with +nature dam (but not +spell dam).
---
There were also cases were the opposite is true:
---
Could kidney, but no auto in [this](https://youtu.be/UpWSrZjLpZ0?t=983)
---
it mostly came down to how the lag played out.
---
I didn’t expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition
---
Grats
---
I was for a while, but stopped the past little bit. Not because my hype has died, but because the circle jerk has produced nothing worth reading anymore, so better to just try to pay attention to something else.
---
&gt; I’ve heard of this on a private server where they removed the scaling and said it was a bug, probably same for classic.
---
Kevin Jordan himself said that he coded in scaling specifically for Poisons. The 1.13 beta database says there's 0% scaling. We need confirmation via testing.
---
Heretic. 
---
I think you might underestimate the size of the Oceanic region and their interest in MMO's in general.  
---
Can look at the fallout with elder scrolls online and other MMO's for choosing not to add oceanic servers; that and the uptake in MoP once they were there.  
---
I cant imagine a dead server. My bet is there will be 1 PvE, 1 PvP oceanic servers and they'll thrive.
---
That is the reason why you needed [more dots](https://youtu.be/HtvIYRrgZ04) for ony. To keep damaging her when she layers.
---
Plate of Spirit
---
From my understanding, TBC is a very difficult game to get working right. 
---
But regardless, there's a lot to do in Vanilla, it takes longer, you dont have to deal with an awkward levelling process like you do in TBC. Also, I'd have to imagine Classic is even more of a novelty because you cant see the content anymore unlike TBC.
---
Flying is CANCER
---
Simple
---
&gt; Yes, I know this, but OP doesn't seem to.
---
I don't care the Feenix guys said, everyone in 2007-2008 knew that Poisons scaled with +nature dam (and you can search through all the forums to find this info). The only question is whether this applies to Classic or if it was an undetected *and* undocumented change from Vanilla &gt; BC, because it's not in any patch notes (either official or unofficial).
---
Vanilla has the largest level range 1-60 so lots of accessible, low commitment content
---
L2swampofsorrows son
---
Its either sub or flat purchase, and the sub is more enticing. By just using the same sub as retail, it is easier and gets more people into the game, and if you play for more than 5 months, you have now given them more money without it feeling such. As to the 'no new content' keep in mind this team will have been developing this for 2 years when it comes out, will have to pay for upkeep of servers and ensuring any issues get fixed still, etc etc. Just because there is no new content does not mean there isn't anything else that costs money.
---
And not a single keybind except the standard 0-9. Authentic but still a YIKES.
---
This time around you can just hop into another layer and you should be g2g on devilsaurs
---
I'm not sure why people think holy paladin means free HK, if anything it's the most annoying class to kill.
---
I'd always avoid attacking a pally cause they can just drag the fight and turn it into a mana battle, if you can't interrupt their holy spells and burst them down then you're in for a long fight.
---
No tank, 4 2 hander dps warriors 1 shaman with windfury totem.
---
Because TBC is not as fun as Vanilla.
---
It means McDonalds has inertia, and it’s difficult to compete against a behemoth.
---
It could have just as easily been Wendy’s selling shit burgers first and McDonalds struggling to unseat them.
---
Look at any popular product in any industry. They’re all shit. Popular music, the worst. Popular movies, unintelligent crap. Popular TV shows, literally make you even more stupid than you already are. Popular power tools, cheap plastic shit that falls apart after a year.
---
Popularity is marketing, not quality. Catering to your average idiot makes you popular. Quality is always niche, and often requires more work by the consumer (know how, research, up keep).
---
He had a soulstone right?
---
Then they will deal with that issue when they get to it, but odds are the servers may wind up with more than 3k max population. Regardless, they have stated that Layering will be gone by the end of Phase 1, no matter how things look.
---
Did you struggle against Hunters at all? Thought they gave mages some trouble
---
Elemental shaman is on the list.
---
Totally, generally youre opening with charge or something anyway, its just nice to have a button that makes you start attacking if you are used to playing rogue.
---
Yeah, but levelling just a warrior is a lot faster than first levelling a mage and then levelling a warrior. Like I would waste 150 hours of potential gold farming on my warrior just to level my alt mage.
---
I’ve been playing on the PVE the entire time tonight I did a /who 40 and there were 14 people online at level 40. 
---
Created a toon on the PCP server a couple hours ago and just about every level range I tried /who listed the max of 50. The PVE server is quite empty
---
No Blood Elvers ;}
---
lolol silent dkp bidding system, that should immediately raise red flags
---
Serious question.. how do you keep track of what gets fixed?  Do they announce fixes anywhere?
---
I get that, but they've been using zone-based sharding for nearly a decade now, it's not just a solution on paper, it's already implemented.
---
Layering is literally sharding, just continent-wide. They likely chose that because it was easier to rename sharding than to face the criticism. A huge portion of this subreddit actually fell for it too. Layering is just sharding with a hat and sunglasses on.
---
right, unless she had a way to prove it, might as well be
---
As a human shadow priest it was undead warlocks.  CC, healing, pets, WotF, damage spells, dots.  Writing this I am trying to remember the match up and how I beat them as priest.  Having dispel and healing was a big help.
---
Oddly feedback was a nice racial since they had to cast to burn you, dot you, and fear you.  Being able to cleanse the dot and the fear not doing damage it was nice.
---
Arh, like that. Still against tos and all the other reasons.
---
corecraft, gummy, and a shitty core
---
well that wins the thread, shit son
---
Gonna be a reckoning...
---
Ya troll is better just dont talk about it
---
go shadow
---
All these people complaining about the yelling but it’s not even that half bad compared to the countless annoying screams found in many other screams
---
I dunno. I started during TBC and never saw classic. I never shit on the idea of classic but was never a big advocate for it until WoD when I truly started to hate the modern state of WoW. After that I lent my voice to the "Classic WoW, with no changes" movement. Sure, I want to play a classic WoW in an authentic way as possible from Blizzard, but my main motivation for this was because I figured that if Blizz saw that the support for Classic was real and the numbers were there, then they might actually go through with authentic TBC servers. 
---
If this doesn't pan out, no real loss to me. At least we get to play a version of the game that has a *good* leveling system and no bullshit warforging/titanforging mechanics.
---
Like money sinks like mounts, repair bills, respec costs?
---
Nah, r/classicwow is more than enough for that.
---
Again, I never said I hate streamers. Can you actually come up with some argument to the topic instead of mindlessly attacking my person ?
---
How am I underestimating the interest? Clearly there's interest but Australia has a fickle populace that latches onto games and then bails. Latest example being PUBG and now we've lost those servers.
---
Not having local servers in 2019 with how cheap server hosting is on AWS/Azure(lol) these days is a fallacy and a slap in the face for current and potential customers.
---
I'm with you and assuming there will be 1 PvE and 1 PvP, it's the only way to do it. If it comes to it and we don't get servers then I'm not going to not play, I'm gonna be disappointed obviously but it isn't a huge make-or-break for me.
---
what bug spreadsheet? link?
---
Hi, /u/gfxprotege

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5lfvh/if_you_could_only_pick_one_class_for_each_race/). 
---
Will be favouriting this and hoping it is updated as we get closer to day 1.
---
Thanks!
---
Throwing away all the previous expansions/features is a major problem I have retail WoW. I wish they had learned to build up the good things that added over the years instead of taking a sledgehammer to all of it.
---
I'll take a TBC server with two changes.
---
1) No Flying
---
2) You Queue for Arenas in Nagrand and Battlegrounds in Netherstorm
---
These two things alone would make WPvP more alive.
---
Healing was balanced?
---
not really. 
---
Devouring Plague lost a lot of its luster in private servers because most people know by now that priests/pallys/anyone with jungle remedy could easily remove it. Not to mention the huge mana cost and cooldown. You basically had to use it with inner focus.
---
Wotf is great. sure. Although there trinkets that also do the job. 
---
Troll's shadowguard is usable in all fights, whenever, wherever, low mana upkeep, insane damage, and can proc blackout. Inner focus is now freed up to use with a mind blast.
---
Berserking + mana burn is amazing, especially with improved mana burn which most spriests have. Berserking + mind blast is incredibly difficult to counter.
---
Hex of Weakness is one of 2? abilities in game to reduce healing effectiveness. Low upkeep and spammable.
---
In most situations, most spriests agree now, troll takes the cake. However, there are several situations still in which DP and wotfk take the cake, particularly in 1v1 world pvp against anything other than a priest or pally.
---
So they are pretty neck and neck but troll probably helps win more fights in the end.
---
Can't say much without breaking NDA but I work in STEM field for company that makes testing system for electronics. Sure there are things that I don't particularly like but I am not going around the town asking people who are not involved to help me make our company better because those pros and cons just come with the job. I would never change what I do though.
---
Wow this is something new, classic fanboy unable to fathom why others like another version of a game
---
&gt;I don't want my character to be perceived in a way that isn't the one intended by my initial character creation.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This is a big point of classic - you can't transmog, you can't change models, no barbershop - you are what you are.
---
So you are okay if I see more grass on the ground, or more trees, or stuff further away.
---
Yep and by the end of Vanilla AV was PvE and WSG never popped. I hope people at least want to play WSG in classic.
---
But he's still right.
---
This will definitely stall a game, at least some.
---
Backcapping definitely favors alliance as far as tower design goes. I could retake and defend an Alliance tower with my rogue by myself, if I was real careful. I did it 5 games in a row once, slowing Horde down just enough for the win. Also the Archer line of sight favors alliance a lot.
---
&gt;Some claim it is because TBC servers are typically not scripted as well as the Classic WoW ones. We saw how big Nostalrius got, but there was nothing comparable with TBC.
---
Netherwing is probably the most faithful recreation of the game, certainly more faithful that most vanilla servers based on Nostalrius client.
---
You probably want to ask this question over at /r/wowservers by the way.
---
There aren't any good SPs on private though, most are keyboard turners and the rest are average at best.
---
In comparison most mages there play the min/max way , so it's obvious they'd beat SPs consistently, a good SP that knows how to juke CS and time reflectors properly is a huge pain to kill, all the priest has to do is survive the initial opening and heal to full then you're playing on their pace for a while.
---
Craghack... just trust him, rogues try. All the time. I probably jumped and tried to stab mobs from behind over a million times. Literally. You're constantly chasing the white whale, but it never works. 
---
Jump down on the mob from a height? Maybe this time it'll work.... nope
---
Stand right on the mob and seizure? Nope, now my eyes hurt
---
That's not how it works.
---
You counterspell one "school" for ten seconds.  If they cast shadow and you counterspell they can simple cast holy.  Also, things you cannot counterspell include shadow word: pain, dispel magic, power word: shield, desperate prayer, feedback, and more.
---
More?  Yes, more.  Namely silence and psychic scream.  Both of which CC the mage and give you free time to nuke them down.
---
Mages are one of the easiest matchups for a good priest.
---
I've heard that happens if your mouse polling rate is above 250hz
---
Yeah same here, if I wanted to play an mmo on 200ms I'd just play ffxiv since my friends are already playing it anyway
---
I remember the first time I saw a tauren warrior with valor shoulders in south shore.. oh Chet you crazy bastard
---
Layering is more persistent. Sharding is way too random, ppl and mobs keep popping in and out. With Layering the world is more static unless you group. 
---
My suggestion was to use layering but instead of locking it to a zone since I dont think it is possible, lock it to a level. All character over level 20 or 25 will always be on the same main layer, no matter what. And since all ppl will be spread out all over the world the 3K cap can be removed for the main layer only.
---
Language specific servers!
---
If they leave in all the out of bounds clipping and wall jumping I won't be playing it. 1 hr games are no fun.
---
I knows you are fighting the good fight, but we need to don't intetact with these idiots, don't feed the trolls. Just smile, wave, downvote and move on! Forever your own sanity, they'll never get it, they're stuck in their own misconception of what/why/how layering is and what it does.
---
GO AWAY FROM DA HEAD LEE
---
1 hour if you were being generous.  Could go on indefinitely with the clipping and wall jumping.
---
In vanilla wow, Months Behind on Dethecus stole our BWL lockout (Guild: Watch Your Back) and killed Nef then posted a recording of us finding out on realm forums. A parody of our guild was made called Watch Your Instance
---
Ever since then I've carried that tradition on as much as I Could
---
On Dethecus in wotlk,  we stole a guilds ToGC lock out and wiped all their attempts on Anub 
---
In wotlk ICC patch I stole Anticipations lockout on Shattered Halls while they were competing for server first hard mode LK and wasted all 50 of their attempts they had which lead to another guild beating them. 
---
I recorded their reaction and posted it all on the realm forums, I then recorded their reaction to my post of me posting their reaction and uploaded that as well.
---
In Mists after working together with a guild called Fables on Antonidas to do mythic 20man SoO for the few months before WoD, I then stole the last lockout and prevented them from being able to do the last boss to get the mount that I had gotten on the previous week.
---
How is that gatekeeping?  I only stated what my personal plan is if TBC servers are announced.
---
I mean this thread is catered to people with drama to share. The op didn't ask for happy stories lol
---
If Classic is even half successful there will be TBC and maybe even Wrath servers. Why not, the content is there just recycle and even if 100K ppl re-sub you are making money.
---
I love Ironforge so much
---
*Hail, friend. ... Have you sheathed yourself in Durotar lately? ... Peace be with you.*
---
ahem..... "That's not how layering posts work!"
---
Don't need outsider help, plenty of people are already getting to lvl 20 /30 on the beta several hours faster than Joana did in his record, and that's only a small portion of the journey to 60.
---
Outsider help isn't going to happen past the first few levels and the speedrunners get ahead of everyone else.
---
Flying I think was one big thing. Really shrunk a very immersive world and wrekt world pvp along with social interactions.

I feel the same way.  Particularly about the flying, it really fucked world PvP.
---
Male Tauren Warriors are the exception in that they are *always* edgelords and 13 years old.
---
Shadow priests are one of the few classes I'd wait until they were fighting mobs to attack.  I still lost sometimes.

I hope you have some places other than r/classicwow to promote your site, because everyone here will know you just copy other people's content.

Unless all layers are equally populated. People seem to assume that there's always just a layer out there with no people in it. They seem to forget that layers = higher population.
---
At 1:27 it looks like you scatter trap, but the length of the trap kind of implies no DR? Or am I missing something? Awesome videos!
---
Ahaha fair enough :p.
---
FS does not work in classic. It's 100% a pserver thing.
---
When it happens in classic it's a "feature"
---
When it happens in ANY other version of the game it's "shit"
---
This is literally the community that is going to be on these servers, and they think it's going to be fun, let's hope nobody plays a classic server that might enjoy WoW for its pros and cons in general, in any expansion, because they will be in for a rude awakening. This is such a disgusting attitude, and if you can sum up everything wrong (in your opinion) with an expansion that had an absurd amount of new subscribers, with a terribly formatted clusterfuck, then I would say that expansion was even more amazing than I remember.
---
It’s exactly how it works.
---
A shadowpriest has two damaging spells apart from SWP, both incredibly easy to CS.
---
If a shadoepriest is casting holy spells, it means he’s out of shadow form and the duel is already over as going back in ensures being OOm.
---
You’ve demonstrated that you know nothing of this matchups meta.
---
Remember the razor strat by chance?
---
That is assuming you actually hit your counterspell. What happens if they fake it?
---
Melee leeway.
---
Spell batching.
---
Language specific realms.
---
RP-PVP realms.
---
Most hunters were so bad that that sort of stuff seldom happened.
---
Not at all.
---
But that's part of classic.
---
Sucks that whole thing was staged, I wonder why he never did another video
---
100% depends what you roll and what exactly you are doing.
---
Solo? main stat + spir is always good
---
dungeons? main stat + 2nd stat or stam
---
Here is the list
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Item\_suffix](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Item_suffix)
---
Yeah each layer will be evenly populated and will never fall below the other layers.
---
Ive accepted that we’re going to have layering but I’m sick of people pretending it doesn’t have any drawbacks. 
---
Honestly just go watch some beta and you’ll see how layering actually works.
---
thanks!
---
Bring us TBC and WotLK without flying and LFG.  And it’s gg.
---
8quests at once? I dont think i can hold back much longer💦
---
The one's with +nature spell damage are probably the least desirable. Near useless for alliance, and not highly sought after on horde. Most shamans leveled as enh.

Spirit increases your mana regen "outside the 5 second rule" and health regen outside of combat. 
---
When stacked while leveling it "can" almost completely remove the need to eat or drink to regen HP/MP or at the very least nerf the need to eat/drink so often.
---
For example: when a warrior has enough spirit stacked for leveling, they never need to eat and in the rare case they actually need to a simple bandage does the trick.
---
All the mage then does is poly to full and drink while the priest is now oom.
---
This isn’t even up for debate, mages&gt; spriest 1v1 with t2+ gear scaling.
---
Nightelfes coming out of stealth, knowing they were waiting for you.. not matter if Rogue, Hunter, Warrior suddenly charging...
---
No idea what all have here with Tauren. They are cuddly cute and always played by carebears... or 50dkp minus Raidleaders haha
---
Holy Paladins are scary. So hard to kill and they can outlast you and still do relevant damage. Honestly Paladins in general are pretty good in wpvp.
---
Maeloth- NE huntard, who learned his class and became proud possessor of Rhok’Delar and represented his class admirably.
---
I murdered people left and right leveling as a prot/holly pally.  The only class that gave me trouble was hunters and shadow priests due to mana drain.  
---
One of favorite stories from leveling: I was around 43 grinding Yetis in Feralis.  An undead rogue tries to  gank me.  I beat him down easy.  Then he tries to gank me while I'm fighting 3 mobs, I hammer him, heal up and beat him down easy.  Finally I did a huge 9 yeti pull, and was doing my normal almost dying while keeping myself alive with the HP seal, while they beat themselves to death on me. He pops out and stun locks me expecting me to due to the mobs.  I bubble and watch 9 yetis beat him to death.  Never saw him after that.

Druid theorycraft, you'll find lots of more builds there  
---
 [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/)   
---
Is for leveling talents, much easier if you all are going different builds to keep tabs of the different level opportunities you'll run into.   
---
[Full bear](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZxxxscMdtV0b)  
---
[Full dungeon dps](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZx0gsfbdtV) cat with powershifting ( i think you should try with powershifting as it is some 150-200 extra dps compared to a none powershifting druid, while it will burn through mana insanely quickly its usually better to increase dps and kill things quicker then to increase your healing, as it will just increase the time of the fight making the increase in healing many times a reduction in speed compared to if you had picked up more dps.   
---
As you might have noticed by now, as a feral druid you are basically forced into either a dps+tank hybrid, tank+healer hybrid, full tank or full dps. You cant really get into all 3 without really gimping the third one which in a sense is great for you guys as there will be less gear overlap. If you want to have insane dps as a cat you want crit like never before but still need a high mana pool making int + agi prio in this case, the bear wont care as much for crit so strength + stamina, while the last druid picks up all spirit + int gear   
---
The only thing that is not really supported by itself is cat dps + healing talents, they dont reach either of the greater talents so that is really the only specc I would advice against. Ofc you can always rely on quite a lot of healing from a hybrid before he goes oom but as i said before if he burns all mana on healing he will lower his dps and therefore you three will need even more mana to finish the entire fight compared to if you had maximised your initial burst and dps.  
---
We still have some 2 months left if you have any questions, otherwise greatest of luck!'
---
I played an UD Rogue , so not much scared me, but I fucking hated any pally.
---
I was a pretty aggressive DPS warrior in my early MC days.  Raid leaders took note of my very high DPS despite having somewhat shit gear.  I simply got to mobs faster than other players and got started earlier.  So the put me in the windufy melee group. I pulled aggro on the next 3 mobs in the MC, requiring me to burn Heath Pots, tubers, and on the last mob, I used shield wall to avoid dying.  After which I requested that I be pulled out of the WF melee group on the trash.
---
It’s in there lol, just got a couple extra letters
---
what do you mean they cant do anything for 10 seconds, they can literally free cast heal if you cs shadow lol
---
Hakkar
---
As a rogue in vanilla: anything that was a warrior
---
Side note: I absolutely hate fighting druids as any class. It always takes so gods damned long to kill them because they just run the fuck away, come back, run away... So now I just don't engage them lol.
---
Do you honestly believe that the beta population is representative of how the population will be at launch?
---
I'm not saying that layering doesn't have drawbacks, but stop pretending that launch will be like the beta.
---
How is breaking Tos subjective?
---
Things phasing in and out and hopping layers to get away from people or for spawns. That’s what’s happening in Beta and yes it will happen at launch. You stop pretending it won’t.
---
the novelty of long AV wears off very quickly.
---
there may be the occasional long game, but generally people do not want to put up with it.
---
Same. I jus bought BFA 1week ago tho... let me tell you: 
---
I dont understand wow anymore as someone who was playing 2400+arenas. Palys have slow, heal, melee and spell dmgs, bubbles, they can fucking MOUNT up in fight etc...
---
Hunters that can go stealth and have 3pets out... etc.etc. its FUCKED.
---
Took me only like 4 or 5 days playn 3hr a day after work to max level 120.
---
I did 117-120 in 1 evening after work, like 5hrs and got my first epic that same night....
---
Why should people stop adressing their concerns?
---
TBC was a step down in quality imo. It could be that people don't like many of the things implemented in TBC. I can't speak for everyone but that's why I stuck to vanilla and not TBC.
---
gorgeous
---
Not if you lived in Sweden. It's hard to say average mbps but if you lived in the city or close suburbs you would have at least 10/1 mb fiberoptics cable decently priced.
---
They are all probably getting their guilds ready to move over to classic together, a lot of them think they will be clearing MC and have it on farm in the first two weeks.
---
Critoris - a human mage. Didn’t get reported until level 32.
---
Yeah idk why people underestimate the paladins. I've witnessed so many of them just whittle someone down with seal of righteousness and holy shock while healing themselves and never running out of mana.
---
Cooking and fishing?
---
Your note about str is rather wrong. And it assumes you need exactly a certain points to kill a mobs. However % damage increase you get is the average percentage of you requiring 1 swing fewer to kill a mob.
---
Yeah, I don't even read the majority of them anymore, smile, wave, downvote and move on
---
Quel'Thalas Eu
---
Happy to help!
---
I don't imagine there are too many spriests running around in t2+, are there? What raiding guild is gearing them up?
---
this :)
---
They think they will, but they won't
---
You can AoE lasher packs as Ele, you can jump run DM, otherwise group up for The Hand farming or dungeoning?
---
Reason #1:
---
There's a one-way overlap in the audience. People who are interested in TBC are also interested in Vanilla, but not the other way around. This means Vanilla servers are able to amass a bigger initial player base, which leads to centralization of players. People don't want to play on small servers, so they all gravitate towards the biggest one.
---
Reason #2:
---
People who liked TBC etc are less dissatisfied. There were over 10 million people playing TBC, 9 million of those enjoyed Wrath, 7 million of those enjoyed Cata etc etc. (fictional numbers, but you get the point). If you enjoyed the game beyond Vanilla you got to play the game for years and years on end, having a great time. So you're less "hungry" for that Classic WoW feeling. If you didn't like TBC on the other hand you only played the game for two years at most, and it's been 13 years since then. You're much more likely to want to re-play that awesome game you only got to play for a short while a long time ago.
---
other races are better. Nightelf is actually really good as you will win the 1on1 against the other rogues.
---
People have been playing vanills for 10 years straight now
---
they deffo mean Hakkar with this. Hakkar is called the Blood god.
---
I laughed IRL
---
Both.
---
Good video. It really makes it clear that this needs to be adjusted.
---
I didn't know that
---
Bro I still play everything on crt monitors, are you telling me you don't want to look at all those juicy pixels?
---
People allways want to blame other things for theire shortcomings...
---
Its easy to say WoW has ruined my life instead of for example not treating my social anxiety or depression or what not ruined my life
---
Ever since vanilla every single guild I've made has been all cocks and balls. It cuts a lot of the straight boy fuck syndrome shit out of the equation
---
Spriest is the easiest class to CS in the game, with mindflay basically auto cs’d due to batching.
---
Sure you can fake it, just like any class can, but it’s not easy, and it’s why bad spriest beat average mages.
---
But good mages destroy good spriests.
---
Shadoerefleftor breaks them two.
---
Double blocks purges all dots
---
&gt;Right-click report removed
---
Why, though? Other things like suggest invite I could understand a bit more since that changes the way the game is played (if only slightly), but reporting rule breakers being easier doesn't seem like a negative to me.
---
Yeah but Fred wont do 50+ runs unless there is a girl in the group.
---
Credence to my point even more.
---
T2+ as a mage is easy to get.
---
There will be nearly no geared spriest.
---
How? Backstab is absolutely useless while leveling since you cant use it on mobs.
---
But at launch we will have more people playing, thus have layers more populated, how is this so hard to grasp?
---
Not stories exclusively Vanilla but WoW drama nonetheless
---

---
I think the raids and dungeon dynamics in TBC were some of the most fun in all of WoW. Also, I feel like TBC still required you to grind mats / items to make gold. I remember having epic wPvP battles in Nagrand while farming elemental motes. I’m really hoping for a TBC revival.
---
Actually the level cap is 0 and there's nothing to do.
---
Hakkar's crying in pain right now
---
Rated pvp in bfa ?? Why you tryn to give advice when you dont know what your talking about.... 
---
BFA arenas is complete garbage. All absorbs, everyone can do everything, rnd burst targets till one dies with no use for cc.
---
A better game. Tbc was the first step to ruin the game.
---
Ignore the people saying "well tbc and wrath had more subscribers" because wow was just getting more popular, not improving.
---
I believe that on some level yes. But we had what 6 million player at the end days of Vanilla? I highly doubt there is so much players this time. And when there is no huge amount of players you can't really make tons of profit because you can't sell so much. But I bet they are there still, just not so much as in past days.
---
And like others said also I believe Blizzard has better tools this time to prevent them.
---
Came here to say this
---
Omg, I forgot about mana burns. That’s going to be a thing again.
---
I think I do but I don't, right? Thanks Brack.
---
Don't pull that "you're talking about it so you must care about it" bullshit. I was simply pointing out that there are other options for streamers that don't want to get griefed all day. You're the one who jumped in and started this side conversation and called me dumb. So don't try and turn that shit around on me. Now fuck off.

I used to be part of a guild that was pretty good. I did a lot of quest with the guild leader and I was promoted to a high rank due to my activity. It was thanks to this guild that I was able to finally reach lvl 60 for the first time.
---
Then someone began writing and posting very insulting messages on each individual member’s note board. The message was very mean and eventually people started leaving. My guild leader wasn’t able to do anything because they were inactive and absent during that brief time. And I think they were the only ones who could have changed the function so only guild leader could edit other people’s member notes. A lot of argument and paranoia happened that created a very unfriendly environment.
---
So yeah, my guild was destroyed because someone or a few people decided to troll.
---
Another thread bashing anything besides classic yet wanting advice on something they've already made their mind up on
---
I hope blizzard pays you something to brown nose them like that. The list is still filled with bugs and issues https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/
---
As a Shadowpriest , what this guy is saying is 100% right.
---
As soon the Mage has Gear a UD Mage with one Block is a massive pain, 2 blocks is insane hard.
---
It start around mid bwl / max bwl gear to get hard.
---
And with aq40/naxx gear on the Mage it is starting to get impossible, alone for the fact there is no stamina gear in game that "counters" that gear.
---
If you think a commission like this costs 1k you know nothing about art
---
Mages need ESSENCE of water for robe of the arch mage, dont assume so much.
---
Would be too hard for me to play the game in its current state, I have so many fond memories of it that it would totally ruin it for me :'(
---
rip archeage f trion
---
it's pretty easy when you're on a 5x server like OP is
---
Look for what increases your damage and go for that.  This is usually agility or +spell power.
---
If you have consumes, +Spirit is taking up space for better buffs.  And you do have consumes (food, water, bandages).
---
Sometimes there is quests that will take you to the past. Like some artifact weapons took you back to ICC. Having those nostalgia quests is maybe the best thing I've had in retail in years. I really do hope they would utilize more of old world. WoW has huge world.. maybe the biggest out of all games. Still there is no reason to do anything that just sit in your faction's main hub and teleport from dungeon to dungeon. That is one of the biggest factors that have made me really dislike what WoW has become. I want to go out there and do things that have value for me. Instead I log in, run dungeons/raids and log out. I haven't visited some of old cool areas in years.
---
When did classic cap at 12million subs? It wasn't until wrath that those sub amounts were hit.
---
Sometimes people forget that the beta is not a demo to play the game but a beta :)
---
Sounds like Alex frasabi was your gm bro
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/htmlview#gid=0
---
Layering will not be a thing in phase 2, so after then I say goodluck.
---
the old world record cant be beaten, simply because its not the real classic, its just a remake of classic. There will be a new record, sure but i dont think it would be titeld as "Joanas WR broken"
---
Just imagine it's VR in wow.
---
Spirit is the worst... just get first aid and maybe some water.
---
Knight's hope, the mine in westfall has 20 tin veins in a single location, just to name a place. (Its supposed to be limited to 3-4)
---
Because there's no meaningful rated PvP in Vanilla for one...
---
Secondly, I know plenty of what I'm talking about. I did a lot of arena in BFA S1 and followed the Blizzcon tourney closely. You don't like PvP in BFA, that's great, don't play it. Don't sit here and tell people who do play it that they don't know what they're talking about.
---
Emulating server lag when there isn’t any server lag (or a negligible amount) to emulate is where no changes is going to far imo. Leeway just makes the game worse.
---
I will take herb + alchemy right at the start. I like using all kind of potions while leveling. I know it would be better to just farm materials and sell them to get more gold. But as I play druid mount at level 40 is not too essential and I can always farm gold later.
---
Margaritas don't come in different flavours. Not real ones anyway.
---
I agree with what you say and really appreciate what information you shared, it will for sure help me in any case. In any case there is a crocolisk recipe for horde 
---

Living the fucking dream.
---
Stratholme living side, you run the instance and roll on crusader orbs or reserve them in a group. (Or round robin the orbs so everyone gets atleast 1.)
---
Used for very common enchants and recipes.
---
How much would it cost then?
---
On knight's hope if you go into the mine in westfall, you'll see about 20 veins, No joke.
---
You making the claim that they won't is based in just as much fact as their claim that they will.
---
lul k
---
Classis was really easy tho.
---
Depends on the artist but generally if you're paying over $150 for something like this you're getting scammed
---
Private server players are no strangers to F R E S H. Classic will be the 5th time restarting for a good portion of them.
---
Be careful, sometimes those same terms are used even when the guild doesn't pay out any gold.
---
We want you stop stop acting as if you speak for us.
---
I don’t have the best internet, but I agree. The ranges seem extreme. Internet speeds have generally gotten a lot faster since 2004.
---
You were the inspiration for the windows on-screen keyboard. What a legacy.
---
Gouge.
---
Hahahah no..
---
In low gear SM/Ruin will shadow bolt crit for like 300 more damage with 10% crit chance and siphon life only does 19 dps.
---
SM/Ruin doesn't scale well through MC and warlock t1 has 1% spell crit.
---
SM/Ruin will start doing much more when BWL comes out in phase 3.
---
Whenever I argue with retarded morons they just leave because they can't handle all my truth bombs.
---
Vanilla is like ladder from diablo for us private server autists. Every time new server launch i ditch the old one and go play on next one. F R E S H is a meme, but its always enjoyable to level and gear up in new server.
---
Classic is just another fresh among every other private servers. Its cool to play the legit game finally, but knowing blizzard fucking up their games i believe private servers still gonna have population after Classic turns into shit. Activision just cant keep their greedy hands off from classic.
---
Nevertheless the exile does not choose his babylon. We will play classic untill we find the freshest F R E S H.
---
Agree here. The playing field has changed in Classic and the ruleset is different.  
---
The original record by Joana was done on a fresh server without layering.  
---
Classic will be fresh *with* layering.  
---
Sadly there is no fair comparison to make.
---
Oh my fucking God we need a company like this making cars!
---
or so you hope
---
this, and even if you say ok i am the best geared shadowpriest in game read:
---
Rank 14 + every raid epic i want.
---
After bwl a Mage will just outscale you so hard, even a bwl geared mage is hard, but with aq40 and naxx you can start to lose against mages with just basic matchup knowledge if something gos just slighly wrong.
---
That has nothing to do with GCD, macro's do not skip over spells on CD, so this will activate Blood Fury and will then start saying its on cooldown.
---
I remember it working back in vanilla though :\
---
Language EU Server .. deutsche Server. Viva Germania. Espanola. La fromage a le baguette.  Polski popolska. Klick Klack.

Toggles are terrible.
---
That's always what I thought.
---
Laughs in Priest
---
threat generation
---
Jesus my last guild we had bong rips mid fight and no one gave a shit.
---
That's what they did in retail. The problem is, fixing this is a slippery slope. You could do this in vanilla, it's part of the vanilla experience, for better or worse.
---
When you say "no changes", do you mean "no changes except the stuff I don't like"? If they fix this, people will cry until they fix other shit. On and on and on until we're back in BfA. 
---
Anyone can get to that spot as long as they know how.
---
F R E S H
---
Thats what most new Paladin players seem to believe but the maths don’t bear this out. 
---
99.9% of fights in Classic are such that JotC is a DPS loss over judging Righteousness for a big burst at the start.
---
Did it to about 46 on pserver recently, not rough at all.
---
Healing meters were a big deal in our guild, almost more than damage meters. Anyone can smash buttons but knowing who to heal and when was the true test of skill in Liquid Pain-Stormscale.
---
One of our priests Griever was top on meters consistantly. He was great pve, and got to rank 3 pvp as well as a holy priest. He knew the fights, brought his own regeants/pots etc.
---
well our druid class leader, Tate, didnt like that. It wasn't that griever wasn't humble or anything, but everyone knew he was the best healer in the guild, bar none.
---
So Tate organized "a coup" with the rest of the druids never to innervate griever and never to give him any mana pots, not rebuff him if he died etc.
---
Well Griever found out, and waited....and waited....and waited
---
Until the surpression room in BWL
---
When he announced that he went into detail Tate's plan, and that he knew, and that he was a stupid piece of shit
---
We didn't down Broodlord that night
---
They need VR WoW 2.
---
I think what made BfA was more crying for easy rewards with low effort. Anything comes to mind that fits that criteria?
---
Given that they exist on retail. I would assume so. I would honestly expect to see more in classic due to gold actually mattering.
---
What you want is not possible, it would have been possible on the original 1.12 client where you could add a lot of conditions to macro's such as if and then statements. But on classic they disabled this, you can only make a macro to check for combat or modifiers.
---
Macro's will not skip over spells on cooldown, so any version of "lazy" macro to use an ability whenever off CD will not work afaik.
---
Our guild worked our asses off to get our MT Thunderfury after the second binding dropped. Just a couple days after we killed Thunderan to finalize the quest our GM stepped down for personal reasons. He passed leadership of the guild over to the MT. I never truly found out what happened, but the MT disbanded the guild in the middle of the night. Basically stole TF and ran. I’ll never forget login into my character screen that morning and seeing my guild tabard blank. We never did reform the guild.
---
Okay I didnt know that. But ... I dont get your Point at all.
---
Isnt it good that this was found NOW in the beta and not in the actual game? Let Blizz get more data about how it works excactly and they will fix it within the next PTR patches and it wont be in classics release.
---
&gt; I wouldn't think less of anyone for thinking that way.
---
I absolutely would. I hate selfish shits like that
---
Joana's world record of 4Days and 20Hours is the standing record. That private server time can't really be taken seriously. Increased respawn timers is probably how that mage got a 2 day 60 time.
---
That said, Joana has said that his record will 100% be broken. He's very confident that he'll break his old record, and that many people will. I'm thinking it'll probably be in the 3-4 Day time range.
---
I had something similar happen, but swap pally for druid and his girlfriend was a mage. She also went off to hang the rogue guildie! Wild.
---
Its a density issue not a population issue holy fuck its like a brick wall.
---
Frontstabbing is really easy to do, it just doesn't work on classic. It was 100% not a thing in vanilla. 
---
If you're trying to do it on private servers the process is just getting really close to the mob and strafing left and right while smashing backstab.
---
Is it only me who see a map of Spain and France but without Portugal?
---
&gt;it makes this community look like a bunch of ingrateful kids
---
I mean, if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck...
---
I'm in a similar boat. I have always played alliance but I have some friends that want to go horde. I have no problem rolling horde but I don't want to roll horde to play with them just to have them give up after a few months. I prefer the appearance of alliance, and how their armors fit them. I guess the biggest thing holding me back is that I've heard the horde pvp que times are nasty. I hope it's exaggerated, but we will see.
---
Yikes lad
---
/camp doesn't work on classic i heard
---
I detest how American gaming companies are censoring their products just to be safe for the communist party of china. Apparently the whole "their culture doesnt like skeletons" thing is a straight up myth and it's just gaming companies playing it safe so the CCP doesnt deny their game from being sold for breaking one of the many communist rules about what's allowed in media. 
---
With that being said though, the gravestones they replaced skeletons with are not bad lol
---
I have some secret places, but I aint sharing! its not secret if I share them ;&lt;
---
I don't have a preference on whether it's kept or not, but I do recall them saying they were going to remove wall jumps in a q&amp;a with some blizzard people a while back.  Not sure if their anti-wall jump tech is already in game or hasn't been applied yet.
---
Right, if nobody actually needs it, everyone rolling need is fine. Turning it over, if someone needs it is also fine (obviously). My point is that it's not fine (for me) to roll need for selling something (and going through with it) if somebody needs the item. Even if that item would be worth 10k gold ... Need &gt; Greed always
---
Hopefully layering is removed after phase 1 like promised and this will only be a problem for the first few months.
---
I never denied that. I said, that a warrior scales much better with support behind him than a ret paladin.
---
You're wrong, well I don't know about your average Joe. But I have always picked UD because of their lore. Not only that but I am always helping people who I meet along the way even enemies by buffing and putting dots on their target. From my point of view undead are.. well.. Forsaken by their former humans, considered monsters, but would a monster show kindness? I highly sympathize with the undead. I bare no ill will towards any race.
---
I guess your route is a secret, but where would you advice going to find the best advice on routes?
---
Indoctrination is deep with this one.
---
Good luck finding someone to test it. Only about 13 people currently active on the beta server.
---
That's not true at all. Roll alliance, head to the barrens, do neutral ratchet quests.

Flight masters will be camped by groups of people. Youll land and be dead.
---
Ive been playing for a bit more then a week now yes and i allready know the meta of this shit..it dosnt take a 100hours study to figure how broken pvp is! Any player that is good at pvp says it aswell, ask ANY actual gladiator about it befor you make a comment..
---
There is no rated in vanilla? Fucking duuuuuh dude smh
---
That's fine from a philosophical point of view, but at the same time it's worth saying modern speed runners, if they had the chance to go back and play in 2006 on fresh servers with Joana, would absolutely smash his old record as well. That's not taking anything away from him, just a reality of what 10 years of competition does.
---
we have any more of these? This is amazing
---
Can we just put all the morons who hate layering on their own layer? Would be ideal.
---
The main guilds will organise time for fights. You're not going to get any significant honour solo.
---
And serious depression/mental issues, I believe. It was very convincing, faked official documents and all. At least to me as a young teenager anyway. 
---
We had a server-wide in-game funeral, then his "brother" logged on a week or so later and started playing his characters.
---
hahah
---
Tanks were really bad though.
---
What do you mean organize?
---
As someone that’s going to play a tank in classic (friend ended up getting dibs on priest) I decided to watch some YouTube videos and one of them was TipsOut’s deep-dive video with Skarm as the expert guest or whatever and I couldn’t finish it.
---
The guy was all over the place and couldn’t answer a question with a direct answer. The video felt completely useless. “9 minutes too long” is being generous imo.
---
SL is pretty shit in low gear too though. You'll be tough to kill, but you won't do any sort of damage. It's useful for defending AB, but in WSG people will just ignore you and kill the people surrounding you while you tickle them.
---
Don't forget the faerie fire that prevent you to stealth for a whole 45 sec
---
Im by no means a speed runner. I am just practicing a few times so I have a decent speed to get through quicker on launch.
---
Here is my 2:02:00 run. I forgot to do the timer twice.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/444350272
---
TBC was the early years where spinning up more servers was worth it and the retention numbers were higher, it was the main product.
---
Classic won't have that luxury and therefore we don't have the luxury from blizzard to be given 100s of seperate realms.
---
Trolls are good but the reason people pick undead isn't just because they're better at world pvp.
---
Wotf is by far the better racial to have in pve over berseking , fear breaker on a healer eclipses slight cast speed tbh.
---
So for pve : Undead.
---
For Wpvp : in most cases Undead.
---
For bgs : both are equally good, maybe troll slightly ahead.
---
But overall undead is generally more useful , not to mention the perks of having the undead casting animation.
---
aslong as its doable for any race &amp; class it shouldnt be removed. aswel as how achievable it is while being peeled, the degree of safespotting it holds etc.
---
Alot of jumps are fine, some are blatantly going outside of the perimiters of the map as its designed, those should be reviewed.
---
1. Doing plenty of meaningless low rank arena dosnt qualify you for shit. Show me your gladiator titel or get out.
---
2. I wasnt telling nobody what they should do.
---
All i said bfa pvp sucks hard.
---
Ok sure if you are someone who has allways fought in the 1300-1600 brackets on previous addons i understand how BFA seems great since you get gladiator weapons with only winning 10-20games? Idk and tbh idc. Sorry not sorry bfa sucks.
---
5 big guilds on each faction will agree to fight South Shore at 6-9pm on Thursday or whatever. Anyone who participates in that will get 50x more honor than any tryhard going around ganking people trying to into black rock mountain.
---
Yeah because all that shitty tank has to do is leave the group. Then they're fucked for 30 minutes minimum.
---
Roll shaman instead.
---
Im an average playing looking to improve slightly

You can heal as shadow spec all the way until the later MC bosses

Thought the weird characters made it look cool. I was an idiot.
---
Just check the respawn timers on the pservers, there is no troll islands in classic release etc... they cant just simply farm mobs like they did on pservers wouldnt work out on retail
---
While watching videos on YouTube I’ve seen some people using an addon that shows the damage of you’re spell on the action bar. Does any one know what it’s called?
---
Thorium brotherhood, Morgan vigil mainly but any flightpath of any high level zone will prob be camped. And the high lvl dungeon entrance too. BRM will be a constant bloodbath.
---
Also, on k3, while we had the queue from anywhere bullshit that allowed every ranker to camp while waiting for bg to pop. We even had rogues farming iron forge inn all day waiting for people hearthing.  Even there we weren't safe and i expect the same thing to happen during phase 2.
---
Well, you have feeedom + swiftness potion as a pretty good gap closer.
---
Groups should prioritize those to rank 14, who show the msot engagement and will to get there. The weapon rewards are fairly pointless, as you can get equivalent gear in BWL. That should only be a factor for groups who aim to reach rank 14 before phase 3 hits.
---
Any FP in the zones for 53+ so players still get honor for killing.
---
Can people stop complaining about people complainimg about layering it's getting old.
---
odd post. what else is reddit for?
---
&gt;Is there a place in Orgrimmar where Alliance can do the same.
---
Around 3 days and a few hours I suspect. Joana himself said that his record is old and slow and will easily be beaten.
---
&gt; You could do this in vanilla, it's part of the vanilla experience, for better or worse.
---
I mean, were they known to ban for it at all in vanilla though? Because they've already shown they're willing to make minor changes related to making customer support's lives easier (which I'm fine with), like trading raid loot. If it was a bannable offense in vanilla, might as well save the CS tickets and just block it from being possible.
---
Nah, just the Reddit hivemind circle jerking itself off like always.
---
Any source on that mage? Interested in the strats used.
---
I think a solution to layering exploits would be putting some sort of mage NPC in SW and Org that will allow you to change layers, that way you can still play with your friends on the server but can’t avoid a gank or abuse farming nodes.
---
Really? No one has said Female Night Elf Hunters yet? Those fuckers always come for the kill when they see you from a mile away

---
This is on a private server I do not have beta access. I am aware not all values for loot and xp may not match. This aside, it's all good fun and practice.
---
"have shit gear"
---
Basically yes, they don't have too much time to farm for gear so they stay last at dps.
---
The best thing about Vanilla is fresh servers. It’s funny how people think that we get sad when a private server closes because we lose all our progress but in fact we couldn’t be more happy to start over on a nice fresh server. Same principle applies to Classic.
---
Bugs and exploits should be fixed. It's not stuff I don't like, it breaks the game.
---
&gt;Something tells me they have become massively risk averse. What am I saying. Of course they are.
---
They always have been. For proof, just look at some of the game's they've announced in the past and then canned, no matter how promising they looked...
---
\**cries in Starcraft: Ghost*\*
---
48+ actually
---
There’s 2 months to launch but not really anything to talk about. It’s just gonna keep going. There’s breaks on stress tests when people are appeased for 2 days but that’s it.
---
Probably Ogrimmar inn. Any inn should work (as long as you are a group of rogues/druids). Just have to go for the more popular one.
---
Ah damn.
---
Is this one of those things the nochanges crowd threaten to not play over if it's not in the game when wsg is added, then subsequently removed because it's an exploit and was removed in vanilla because it was an exploit?
---
&gt; That's fine from a philosophical point of view, but at the same time it's worth saying modern speed runners, if they had the chance to go back and play in 2006 on fresh servers with Joana, would absolutely smash his old record as well.
---
You could say that about almost kind of competition though.  People who were all-stars when their sport was new (or just starting to gain popularity) are often mediocre compared to the best of the best modern players.
---
My guess is that they didn't just randomly all decide to go shadow. Read between the lines.
---
There is literally the wall of no - everything you typed in this post has been said to those of us who wanted vanilla. 
---
TBC had gear for every spec, it was really fun to have all specs viable. 
---
You may not like how it was - but most of us still used the old world and created our own world pvp moments in Outland and Azeroth. You may not experienced these things but a lot of us did.
---
But I believe it was fixed in vanilla, I used to do all of this in wsg, I remember that I could jump the horde tunnel gate before the game starts, when the game started I was already in alliance side. It was fixed with invisible walls.
---
I played hundreds of games in Season 1 and was above 2450, but keep being a jackass.  I played high rated arenas back in Wrath as well, I've done plenty of PvP in this game. But nah, you're 1 week of experience in BFA is much more valuable and relevant, you're right.
---
Was she hot?
---
I was on Turalyon Horde, don’t remember the guild name though!
---
I'm sure we'll get some bandaid fix that "emulates proper melee range". Just like Spell Batching. Tofu.
---

---
Tons of guilds will have MC on farm on week two. The real challenge is to clear MC before the first reset. There’s a few guilds planning to do this.
---
Isn't there a mod to auto-complete and auto-accept quests?
---
Pls just stop
---
exactly my opinion aswell.  
---
if everyone can do it at any given point in time its fair game.
---
vipersting is arguably one of the best skills a hunter has for pvp. outranging and restacking it is super aids for every casterclass
---
For raiding it becomes the go to spec from AQ onwards and does great damage.  Not possible before that as lots of bosses in early raids have fire resistance. For levelling and pvp frost is the go to though.
---
Wonder if they'd go as far as to implement old AV as an honorless, cross-server battleground - maybe even make it two raids, 80v80.
---
lazypig
---
You don't have to spec holy to heal in raids. Just get some int gear and collect +healing wherever you can and oyu are good to go. Out of the 30 talent points you'll spend in holy, really only healing light are of any relevance when levelling.
---
Illumination is great, but with ~5% spellcrit, you won't notice it much. 
---
If you want to go non-ret, Id say put 14 points into holy (int, pushback protection, consecration, healing light), then switch to prot and get redoubt, improved RF and shield spec. This allows oyu to heal effectively, tank effectively and you can go aoe farming as prot when solo.
---
your assessment is clearly biased and also very shallow. seems like you're just trying to defend your preference than prove a point.
---
Fact is most if not all hardcore spriests roll shadow now. Shadowguard (which you didn't even mention) is just too good. But yeah sure roll undead, the difference is pretty marginal in the long run anyway
---
An account with a world of Warcraft subscription.
---
utility is key. i know its just my opinion, but i rathet take a lowmana/hugeutility racial over a 30 sec cooldown bonusdmg that wont apply when you get shadowguard stunned
---
Should I count on it working for launch? Every addon I am using currently is more of an aid, but I wasnt counting on any of them working
---
For Bgs definitely ele shaman, shadow while one of the best dueling specs is pretty mediocre in group pvp
---
There you go: Gathermate2 https://willitclassic.com/view/dzCMjfvozhKA2AXPfwAM
---
What do you mean wont spell time enough in undead areas, did you totally forget duskwood ?  
---
I also disagree with not training many of the skills, you are a paladin, your mount is free
---
Dude, thank you so much for this indepth reply. 
---
I was shaking my head at so many things in the guide but you actually took the time to write it all down. 
---
This „guide“ is a sham and I‘m surprised that noone at classicwow.live actually thought about what‘s in it.
---
As long as you have an account with active game time you can play. If you own World of Warcraft (regardless of any expansions) and have a current subscription, Classic is waiting with arms wide open
---
Another thing that i would be interrested i would be the imps regenerationg, it does not need to be fully leveled but just some observations such as how much regenen did it have at lvl 10, lvl 20 and lvl 30 etc.. along with how much int &amp; spirit it had. 
---
The imp is known as the mana battery and no pserv to date has ever guessed its true regen, tried being a tester for diff pservs and always when it comes down to that imp it ends up being guesswork based upon a couple recordings.
---
The imp is rather interresting but by far the improved firebolt talent interrests me the most as either it will affter gcd at least for that spell, or taking two points in it is meaningless and perhaps even a bug.
---

---
Undead warrior got to level 30 until I then rolled paladin for wrath
---
I'm not, obviously. The game starts at midnight 27th ftom my perspective.
---
Well data about people with no vitals
---
😂
---
If you are able to play during a stress test, you can find out.
---
Where is the holy paladin?
---
Maybe you should think about what is posted in your guides and fact check it before misinforming your „customers“ in the future?
---
Why would he post anything on your site?
---
I'm tossing up between the same, although I don't mind healing on the priest as it's generally what you'll be expected to do in groups, especially raids.  
---
I think for me the main difference is in leveling, priests are faster and you'll have a better time in world pvp.   
---
The downside for priest for me honestly is higher responsibility when raiding. The priest healing toolkit means that they will more often be healing tanks, which can make for a more stressful experience. Shamans basically just do their totems and spam chain heal, if they miss a heal worst case scenario is a dead DPS, not a wipe like a priest keeping the MT up.  
---
What can I say, I'm lazy sometimes.
---
Mine was "Blume" which means flower in German.
---
After that, all my following characters were named as flower names like Veilchen, Gladiole etc.
---
Because like in every expansion, once everybody is max lvl they stay in the new zones and the original world is empty.
---
Roam stv with a team of 2-3
---
There are multiple private servers that spawn node upon node. 
---
K servers do this 100%
---
gnomes are cool though
---
Tauren enhancement shamans used to destroy my mage. Purge the ice barrier then stormstrike wf earth shock would kill me.
---
Can you elaborate? how does it work? Aren't there diminishing returns
---
“Squeaky wheel gets the kick!”
---
Yes there's still diminishing returns but you'll still get 1,000 + kills. No one trying to go around solo ganking people will come close.
---
You judge SotC against bosses. Against normal mobs and trash the fight doesn't last long enough to be worth it.
---
I'll check it out tomorrow that's near Prince anyways
---
Even a geared character with 100 days+ /played is worthless on a dead server. So really, you're not giving up anything much. Especially a geared character, actually, since there's nothing meaningful you can do without a full raid.
---
I am confident new private servers will spring up, especially if Classic should turn out to be less than what people expected, but the days of the currently populated realms are probably numbered.
---
And he was responsible for knowingly breaking up a committed relationship. This door swings both ways, friend. It's hard for you to see as you're so close to the guy, but your friend pulled a serious dirtbag move. The whole "you'd be so hot if you lost weight" part is incredibly creepy and manipulative. There's a big difference between supporting someone's own weight loss goals and prodding them towards how you think they should look by tacitly implying they aren't attractive.
---
What? How is this possible?
---
as a mage in tbc, i feared only one thing
---
undead sl/sl warlocks.
---
&gt;Caution for those thinking pets/cosmetics will be expensive.  Without a toy-box, the novelty items weren't that huge back in vanilla.  Pets were meaningless to most people until the pet system/ achievement system went into effect.
---
Pets are ALWAYS popular with casual players. Maybe raiders and hardcore pvpers don't care for pets, but farming whelps (I've even posted about this before) was extremely lucrative for my druid in vanilla. People lose their minds over baby dragon pets following them around.
---

---
What guild were you in during Vanilla?
---
My question is why are people freaking out so much in the first place? Vanilla had tons of bugs. If anything, it just adds to the original experience if they don't fix everything.
---
DarkStars is the real heroes of the alliance.
---
Holydeath - troll priest.
---
Hell, 12 year old me was edgy af. Still my main to this day, but changed the name in early wrath.
---
Ye, people are already very familiar with making addons for this client (since they are using the legion one or something or am I totally retardeD?) and seeing how it would be a great time to take the spotlight as THE ADDON. I'm sure there are tons of creators who have already begun their work and are just waiting to adjust/re-write what's needed.
---
A friend huh
---
The hunter...
---
Congrats!
---
How many comments does the biggest rppvp post have? If less then that's something to work on.
---
Shattered Hand, right? I know exactly who you're talking about, as does almost everyone from that server. Pretty sure Project X was highly illegal.
---
Level caps been at 40 since 3 weeks now. There is only so much you can do. Even the msot dedicated players have now complete Bis gear for lvl 40 and tried all the whacky challenges they can think of and less dedicated ones are gone for a while now.
---
There is also little testing to do, as lvl 40 just isn't that relevant for testing specs and items.
---
Is this what was happening on a private server? It is probably bannable by Blizzard for wintrading.
---
Some of us really appreciate the refresher since we haven't played in 10 years. I imagine there will be some amount of people who never played vanilla at all. These guides are helpful, even if they aren't perfect.
---
How is my assessment biased and shallow exactly ? you yourself said undead is better at world pvp, yes?
---
In pve undead is the better option because breaking fears is marginally more useful than slight casting speed, even if you manage to use it while you are low on hp which shouldn't be happening too often to begin with.
---
You will almost always be placed in the caster groups as a horde priest so that's somewhere between the 6th and 8th group, shamans having priority on melee groups means that the odds of getting a shammy in a caster grp is low, so you cannot rely on having tremor every fight which is why wotf is marginally better on healing priests.
---
I'm literally showering you with non biased facts, what are you telling me besides troll is better vs paladin ? who's really biased here ?
---
Random question of my own, were imps ever used in PvE for DPS?
---
I know they found a home in TBC for Destro locks but did they make an appearance in classic for anything other than STA?
---
Just curious because this kind of thing interests me and I've not been paying close attention to the beta: What bugs does the batching system have currently?
---
Who did these? amazing work
---
I remember that we got ganked in Org quite a lot by a Team of 2-3 Rouges sometimes only 1. 
---
Just by the Portal master - you get quite good traffic of People and also don't have too many guards. Also you are up in a building which makes it even harder for guards..
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
Gonna be harder without DM gear, and with the AI not being super broken. Not impossible but hard
---
Like the great Mike Tyson said " Everyone's got a plan in the ring until they get punched in the mouth."
---
Having a route/plan is fine but you biggest assest will be your ability to efficiently adapt no matter what situation you come across.
---
I imagine they will shave a day or so of Joana's record. Although if layering is really abusable we might see sub-3 day mages.
---
Solo aoe grinding
---
Exactly. It really isn't a huge problem.
---
Where is taht exactly
---
Indeed. Blood porting is completelyt dependant on where you're at and what level the mobs are. If you have to start running out of your way to find mobs it starts eating into the whole purpose of it, especially if speedrunning
---
It was back in 2007, I was 8yo and named her  Saam like Sam from Totally Spies
---
\[many, many citations needed\]
---
The first few raids were largely fire immune or resistant, and the imp has like 1,5k hp with its own stamina buff, so it gets wiped out by more or less any stray aoe, thus losing your entire group the buff.
---
It's most likely better off Phase Shifted, or at the very least only used on fights where you know for sure that it won't die.
---
&gt; EVEN if you find the magical totally fair and trustworthy loot council, every decision is still the arbitrary choice of some humans. This means that those who don't get drops are now free to imagine all sort of slights and drama, thus causing problems in the guild.
---
I have but one upvote to give, but you deserve hundreds.
---
In the deep
---
You may not go into the low level zones, but the city of gilneas feels like a total waste. At least make that a hub city that people can go to with something in it.
---
Because you're ignoring shadowguard. It didn't appear once in your comment. And I actually should take back what I said about undead and wpvp. Troll does better most of the time. Shadowguard does as much dps as DP with 100% upkeep (which one should) less mana, and blackout proc chance. I just can't deny that there are a few fights where DP carries.
---
It doesn’t do. Is there a player solution to the problem? If yes, it doesn’t break the game.
---
Any player can get to that spot, so yes.
---
Maybe. I don’t want ranged classes to be op, nor do I want melee classes to be able to melee from like 12 yards out. This mechanic makes melee essentially ranged. If rogues and warriors in classic weren’t overplayed enough, this will only rip the scales in their favor. This video was uploaded by the most skilled rogue I’ve ever watched, even he thinks it’s too much.
---
Was it? I feel like that didn’t happen until TBC
---
Having the give patchnotes and not letting us do the whole testing agaib would be great.
---
I don’t think many people got banned for it, if any
---
In the speed leveling realm, comparing Vanilla to Private Servers to Classic is basically apples to oranges. They might was well be three completely different games tbh.
---
Thanks
---
Stuff like this makes me hope for true Classic servers and then (at least a year after Naxx) Progression Classic servers.
---
It’d be great to have something like Progression Classic servers that try to create content on Azeroth (like Gilneas) that Blizzard clearly wanted to do something with, eventually, but ultimately become cut content.
---
Of course, if something like that we’re to ever happen, it’d have to be done with an established bible/rule set for what is and isn’t ‘Classic’ to be designed/developed in the vein of.
---
Someone was tracking population on the beta server for last weekend at it peaked at around 700 players.
---
Shadow priests were changed in one of the first patches of BFA. It's almost as if I covered major class revamps and overhauls in my post as something that cannot be solved during a beta window it takes too much time. 
---
The problems people are having with classic are not major class overhauls or even system overhauls (though layering comes close) they are bug fixes.
---
Id rather they remove any of the jumps. Or make any area were not suppose to go actually impossible to reach 🤓
---
No changes
---
Wsg doesn't even exist anymore on live.
---
Personally, I completely skipped the original TBC phase while playing both vanilla and WotLk, so there is 0% nostalgia at all, only a weird space theme and bad lore. It's like playing a pokemon game starring anything past the original 151 ones.
---
We'll see if popularity for TBC rises pot Classic release. I certainly expect it to.
---
Did you read past the first few lines. It's almost as if I should have had a paragraph devoted to talking about large overhauls and the reasons those don't get fixed in a beta. 
---
Not that it matters because none of the issues presented in classic are major changes they are largely bug fixes or ui changes
---
Alright man. I happen to illustrate for a living, if you do to and are able to paint at this level and sell your work for less than 150$ then I am sad to hear so.
---
If you are able to paint on this level it shouldn’t take you more than a couple days work. Seems like a decent paycheck for that amount of time.
---
My private server character now has tier 3 and come classic I'll never log on again
---
Joana's world record of 4Days and 20Hours is the standing record. That private server time can't really be taken seriously. Increased respawn timers is probably how that mage got a 2 day time.
---
Cyberpunk 2077 hype is very real.
---
No flying, it ruined and shrunk a vast immersive world, along with ruining world pvp and a big social aspect . But I would still opt for how it is originally I guess. 50/50 I duno
---
You can use AUX for this, its classic friendly and I think it already ported.
---
2-3 weeks is more than enough time to cause damage...
---
No shit.
---
Do you honestly think that Blizzard can rebalance classes and revamp the azerite system, get it polished enough to be tested, gather feedback and then fine tune those changes in a 3 months beta? Do you have any idea how much work that is. 
---
But that doesn't even matter to this discussion because outside of maybe layering (which seems pretty easily tuneable) none of the issues with classic are system overhauls they are you changes or bug fixes. AI tuning and coding optimization. All of which are easily fixed

You're practicing to... play a game.
---
\&gt; I believe he's constantly abusing this in order to draw attention to it 
---
I didn't watch this example in particular, but the other day he was doing those kind of things (jumping in places hard to reach, walls hug etc.) and laughing at people calling him "exploiter", including another streamer named swifty (or something like it), and he was saying that people calling for a ban/report on him were toxic. His reason was that it was way easier for them to call a ban than to learn how to jump...So I'm really not sure he's doing it for the reason you said, at least not in the stream I saw.

BC is a very good exspansion, but since just as much people or more want classic, it makes sense to start from there.

The imps damage without any talents vs a lvl 60 target would deal 48.18 dps
---
imp with 3/3 improved imp would deal 62.65 dps
---
curse of elements 72.04 dps
---
improved scorch 77.68 dps
---
nightfall 87.076 dps
---
orc  90.425 dps
---
aq20 set 93.77 dps
---
pimgib trink
---
bwl book 240.17 dps
---
pimbig 102.55 dps
---
bwl book 261.88 dps
---
improved firebolt 1/2    349.17 dps
---
improved firebolt 2/2   523.76 dps
---
\------------------------------------------------
---
as u see the improved firebolt makes quite a major difference based on if its capped by gcd or not, well it does not exactly make much sence as the talent would be half broken if only the first talent point can be of use.
---
I wanted to run Horde this time. My wife wanted to run a Night Elf Priestess - yet again.  
---
We compromised, so I'm going to play a Night Elf.
---
In the hunter vs world clip (Which is from 2012, so We dont know if its a private server) he's using zul'gurub+ gear (Since he transforms into a zul cat boss.) he's using very high-end maneuvers and pet skills, a normal person wont be doing that.
---
I dont know if its a private server video or not, I tried to analyze as much as I could, but he was using pretty sketchy stuff, also it wasn't a real tribute run, he was killing the bosses. (Including the observer, which made the fight a lot easier.)
---
Feign death resistance was also a thing and he almost died because of it, good thing the boss had poor pathfinding.
---
Not bashing the guy by any means, but any regular player wont be doing this, sorry to say, takes phase4+ to start making that gold, you should have plenty by the time the farm comes online.
---
Yeah I know - ofcourse we all want a good game as Close to the original as possible. 
---
I'm totally with your their. We just have different approaches. 
---
I totally Support making Blizzard Aware of those Problems time after time so they fix them. 
---
I just don't Support some People in the way they bring it over to other People saying Blizzard is a shit Show that is not Fixing anything and People that believe that Blizzard actually fixes stuff in the Beta are delusional and should go Play something else... 
---
Like.. Why would People say that? It's obviously not true and just mean.. Crazy stuff m8.
---
I'm with you though. We all just want a good game :)
---
Have a nice day bro
---
Seems lame as fuck to me ! For the horde!
---
Since eu won't have localized servers, not great imo
---
Hey, you're right.
---
Where I live, 150$ is somewhere around the minimum wage for one work day at any regular job. As a programmer, our working hours are billed to customers at around \~100-200$ per hour depending on the project.
---
Yeah you are thinking incorrectly about this (judging by that comment)... how long did it take to raise your skill level to this level 5 years? 10 years? Those years had little to no pay and for many also student loans. 
---
You need to account for that when you price your art work especially when its commercial. There are surprisingly few people that can do a image like the original, many think they can but few can actually pull it off. And that has great value.
---
Furthermore the original has this sub drooling over the painting and praising him for it... that has value even though there are more accomplished painters out there he was the one that did that painting and was the first to show this community a high end painting of ironforge everyone else will be a copycat.. so more value there
---
I can go on... but bottomline timespent per painting is the least important factor when determining value.
---
And if you do work in the creative field please look up" the futur " on YouTube and start charging more
---
Actually I started playing wow in late 2007 or perhaps 2008 on a french private server that was decently scripted up to T5 in PvE (except Kael Thas), with working arenas and BG (except Alterac). There, I basically played the whole content until 2.4.3 and it was a great experience ! But when LK went out I went on official servers.
---
Quick google gave me this info on WSG:  
---
 
---
The game awards bonus honor to everyone on your side of the match for reaching certain goals. Those goals are:
---
* capturing the opponents flag, rewards 396 honor (at level 60)
---
* winning the match, rewards 198 honor (at level 60)
---
Honor for lower level matches scales down from the amounts given. Other scored events are not granted honor. These include: killing blows, picking up the opponent's flag, and returning your flag to your base. Honor is awarded for honorable kills as normal.
---
Winning a complete match (3 captures and the win bonus) gives you 1386 honor (at level 60). It also awards you 3 marks of honor. Turning in the quest for 3 marks of honor is worth an additional 396 honor points.
---
Losing a complete match (0 captures and a loss) gives you no bonus honor. The only honor you will accumulate will come from honorable kills. You will receive 1 mark of honor at the end of a loss, so you can still collect 3 and turn in the quest as given above.
---
During the Warsong Gulch Battlegrounds Holiday, you will earn double reputation bonus for each flag captured on your team. The winning team will earn an additional 990 bonus honor (at level 60) for completing the match, in addition to the usual 198 bonus. The losing team will earn 594 bonus honor at the end of the match. Thus a 3-0 match will award a total of 2376 honor to the winners, and 594 honor to the losers during the holiday.
---

Now you can calculate a fast group doin warsong in \~9minutes.  
---
&gt;During the WSG BG weekend, you will earn double reputation bonus for  each flag your team captures. The victorious team will receive 990 bonus  honor for completing the game, as well as the usual 198 bonus. Meaning a  3-0 match will award a total of 2376 honor to the winning team. The  losing team also receive 594 bonus honor at the end of a game on a WSG  weekend.

Second on CTRaidAssist.
---
It really is compared to the Barrens but it's what we got lol. There is no experience like legit Barrens chat.
---
You can't open world PvP in tbc cos when you're in your raid gear you'll be 1v6ed by a gear in resilience gear.
---
"FLAME! DEATH! DESTRUCTION! " Best lines in the game, I love it! BWL is a good designed raid.
---
I'm happy to be corrected if you'd be so inclined as to show me the evidence of your claim, I cannot find any records of a solo run in vanilla, and it was not a thing on the server I was playing at the time. (I played a hunter throughout the entire span of vanilla, so I would know this.)
---
Threat wasn't well documented.
---
Tanks are still really bad though, 15 years of documentation and knowledge and they still manage to be absolutely worthless. Which is great for the rest of us.
---
Hehe :d Yes exactly that... It did ruin a big part of the game. You can get a new Travel form that makes you 120% Mount Speed if you want :P
---
I hope you don't get what you want.
---
Your little brother is most likely 25 this time.
---
As an horde player, I would like an UC one !
---
I wouldn't call it a "sham" but its pretty far off from my standards regardless, hopefully people learn to keep their eyes out on private server info before the game launches.
---
Thanks for replying, I appreciate it.
---
I stopped reading after you said protection pots weren’t going to be used.
---
high dynamic respawns is how that guy got such a low time imo

---
I don't think it's wrong to discuss healthy living options. The part where it may perhaps become questionable is (assuming) motive.   
---
For instance, if an individual pursues change in another for personal gain, it is likely manipulative, and ultimately dangerous. This is typically because motives like this often lead to near-impossible expectation management, which typically resolves in further failed relationships.  
---
However, what is generally not assumed, is the possibility of genuine care for another individual. The liklihood of this is remote, and generally disregarded, as in this case, the individuals did not have a close working relationship as friends outside of online interactions - which greatly limits effective communication. This means that while the guy in this story may have indeed been genuine, it would be much easier for him to simulate genuine care, regardless of whether he did or not at the time.  
---
In either case, it is possible that while motives may have been genuine or not in the beginning, genuine care may have lead to a legitimate, healthy relationship between the two.  
---
The part of speaking to a girl he wanted to date, who was in a committed relationship creates an entirely new scenario. In this case, directly confronting issues with someone he is interested in seems innocent enough. However, there is something to be said for the missing peice of this puzzle: we must assume that given the information provided, she was not available to pursue another relationship, having a current commitment to another.  
---
While many have no issue with the pursuit of anyone in this particular circumstance, it is worth noting the morality/ethics of this situation. First and foremost, what is the nature of the new relationship, founded on this separation? The man in this case, once securing his prize, then must deal with the internal dilema surrounding the inevitable question: Will do the same to me that she did to her ex?  
---
This often results in various character traits deemed negative, or even entirely dangerous. Some individuals become possessive. Others never fully trust their partner, constantly searching and allowing no quarter of personal space, to ensure compliance with their new contract. This may also be considered possessive, but is usually defined as "controlling" - as many times these individuals are steadily isolated from other friendships, phones or e-mails and other personal items are scrutinized or confiscated altogether, and any sort of freedom comes at a high cost.  
---
On her side, she must cope with the knowledge she hurt someone she once cared about. And, she did it for her own personal gain - so no matter how legitimate, she will live the rest of her life with this thought weighing on her conscience. Then, she has to realize that she has stuck herself in this situation, with a new man, who was willing to pursue a woman already in a commitment, which means his own commitment to her may not hold the same value she hopes and desires.  
---
Together, they must learn how to acknowledge the breakup, and focus on clear communication, building trust and accepting their faults. Otherwise, they will begin to mistrust each other, which quickly leads to back-up plans, reserved emotions, etc., all of which creates distance and breaks down any basis for a relationship. Eventually, they either hurt each other enough that one of them finally leaves, or one of them finally cheats.  
---
Either way, the cycle begins again, with more people hurt, and more unsatisfied, broken relationships, that never saw their true potential realized.  
---
And this is just one sad - even dangerous - possibility out of thousands... ...when a relationship is based on broken commitments.
---
Yep... Defenitely to do with the respawn rates. I played a bit from 1-20 and some of those Mobs spawned after 4-5 seconds... I didn't even have the time to loot a couple of them xD
---
Yeah, as a hpally main I mentally blocked those shenanigans from my memory until I saw your comment, and then it all came flooding back. Definitely the best way to deal with caster longevity, especially healers.
---
I said they wont be used early game, please try and read again. (You will be using them once naxx comes out and AQ40)
---
The post focuses on the early to midgame, not phase4+
---
Have a nice day.

Only due to temporary lagg though, right?

I don't really see the slippery slope to LFD, since there are already vanilla addons that basically act as LFD from what I've heard, I haven't actually used them. The people that don't want to look for others in world chat will already use that, and not having suggest invite will not change the situation for them in my opinion. If by slippery slope you meant blizzard adding LFD, I would have to strongly disagree that suggest invite would lead there, as even blizz got it through their thick skull that people want the original experience.
---
As to your other point, what happens if 3 people write "inv Therealrecollector", the group leader still has to choose only one, leaving the other two upset. And the kind of group leader that doesn't say in party chat "*whoa boys, I have three of those new invite suggestions thingies at the same time, let's talk about which class we could use the most*" isn't the group leader that would say "*whoa boys, I have three invite suggestions in party chat at the same time, let's talk about which class we could use the most*" and just pick on his own

To be clear, [tender crocolisk meat](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3667), and [crocolisk meat](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2924), are different items. They are not interchangeable.

Warriors will buy nature pots for whirlwind axe, fire prot potions WILL for sure be used for only and MC early. 
---
Like I said, I stopped reading after point 2, but this is just your opinion, and you can literally make gold doing anything, his guide is fine. Pets have a low ass drop rate, but if you ever do get one it’s mad money. Also if you see his $ dollar sign to rate the amount of gold he ranks it as, it doesn’t even have 1 $. Not the best for money making.
---
No, I didn't forget Duskwood. Wasting money on a spell just to have an extra ranged pull, on top of the ones you already have, is *meh* as fuck.
---
Get that shit when you're ready to do the plaguelands and tanking Stratholme. Don't waste money on that shit for freakin' *Duskwood.*

Customers don’t pay you for the time it took you to learn something, just for the time it takes you to make this. And those people drooling over it have no idea what it entails to make it. They drool over Bob Ross paintings too which require very little effort.

No company in the world would pay you that much. Would you be able to find an ignorant person who pays too much? Sure. But it’s not the standard.

I hadn't touched WoW since mid Cata and started playing on Pservers a few months ago. Levelling different classes to get a feel for the game again. I joined the biggest levelling guild on K3 (800+ members) and your question comes up regularly in chat.
---
I would say the census is about 2 thirds are going to play Classic when it releases the remaining third won't. Main reasons for not switching to Classic are: 1) Not wanting or being able to pay the monthly fee. 2) People not wanting to give Blizz/Activision any money. 
---
I personally very much look forward to Classic's release.
---
8.0 had big interface latency issues, like professions tab or ah and also compared to private servers some things like loot table is slower on retail
---
This makes sense, Ultima Online was a big inspiration for a lot of their systems and in that game you could lose enough rep to major factions, which made you hostile to people in neutral zones and cities. 
---
It was quite fun.
---
Tauren warrior for sure. I have vivid memory of my first few weeks playing the game circa 2006 as a Gnome mage. A Tauren Warrior rocked up in Thelsamar to kill some lowbies squashed me. I thought it was pretty terrifying. I pretty much immediately ditched that character and re-rolled Tauren warrior, which became the first toon I got past lvl 20\~ and was my defacto main from then on up until the end of TBC.
---
Yep, like [the New York Times, back in 2007](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/magazine/17lootfarmers-t.html), rightfully **roasted Blizzard for dragging its feet on implementing the WoW Token:**
---
**That's right! Blizzard was always anti-WoW Token!** until they realized that the world is way more complicated than they thought. I wish r/classicwow had that kind of moment of clarity.
---
Hey! me and my friends ran Warrior/Rogue/Priest too - simply because our fourth friend quit and we just felt like doing the dungeons ourselves. We were actually considering going triple Druid this time round too haha
---
Artists usually don’t make as much as engineers

I'm not a native speaker so maybe sham is a bit harsh.

But the information they provide seems at least faulty and bordering on misleading.
---
The customer is paying for your skill not time spent.
---
I'll try different settings between the different zones but mostly high I believe
---
I played hunter, and I used to farm DM tribute.
---
Unfortunately I have no records or any other hard evidence.
---
I don’t think so, skill is a pretty hard factor to gauge.
---
*95% of guilds would honestly be better off with /roll*
---
But every group of Super Best Friends with any experience in vanilla raiding at all thinks they're an uber elite and will run a guild with some shitty *Best Friend LC*. Buddy, you're not D&amp;T Reincarnated and you're still going to cause drama when you give your girlfriend the guild's first Lok'amir. It doesn't matter if she *deserved it more*. You still fucked up.
---
Or they are full of whiners who can't handle the mere thought of somebody winning something *they don't deserve* (hint: anyone who isn't them doesn't deserve it) and set about creating an arbitrary system of *pretend deserve points* to feel better about themselves when they don't get something.
---
The classic is dead thing i think was just because there were midsummer holydays
---
It scales with strength from gear and from buffs, but not with flat +Attack Power.
---
But seriously, Do you make art for a living? A genuine question btw
---
&gt; Warriors will buy nature pots for whirlwind axe, fire prot potions WILL for sure be used for only and MC early.
---
Warriors will simply ask a high level or a friend or guildie to help, nobody will waste gold on that, and if you want nature prot potions early then you make them yourself, its way too expensive to buy pre-40.
---
On private servers (Which is overtuned like crazy) people can run MC in leveling gear without prot potions and still beat molten core fairly easily, stating that fire prot potions will be used in an easier version of MC is foolish.
---
Pet's wont sell until late-game, once again, "mad money" only comes when people have surplus from playing a lot.
---
My replies and guides focuses on the early to mid-game, that is just how it is, I know its just my opinion but I think people should really not be telling other's how to properly make gold when they know nothing about it.
---
It's not my fault you stopped reading, that's on you.
---
I wont reply to this again.

You chose your username well.

Your mates shouldn't be on different layers. The only reason they'd be changing is forming groups. Plan better or use the fricken hearthstone. "I don't want to walk" is not going to get you pity in classic.

Subscribe. 
---
I have resubbed as of the beta launch and do not plan to unsub again.
---
Just like back then, if someone is moronic enough to roll greed while everyone hits needs and then proceeds to complain about it, then that person is a moron. 
---
Rolling greed opens you up for being ninja'd.  Rolling need does not, therefore everyone who wants it should roll need.
---
wow thanks!
---
The karma whoring reposts on this pic have been unreal
---
I don't think the #nochange crowd cares about exploits.
---
I'm pretty sure they would all agree that (game breaking) exploits shouldn't be recreated.
---
Pretty sure they wanted the hype for it to die down a tad due to 8.2. I expect more invites after Mythic is cleared.
---
Garxor, human paladin on Hellscream US
---
A guild is not going to fund a healer/tank respeccing lol... 
---
That is a luxury, not a necessity.  You can easily just mine nodes or gather herbs for all the gold you need for raids.  That is what I did and I made a fortune. 
---
At the end of the day, no matter what you choose to do, it really depends on the hours you spend on doing it.  Don't expect a guild to front your inability to spend time playing the game or laziness.
---
It's not exactly win trading so nothing blizzard will do. It's no different than a guild challenging another to a fight. 
---
Now if one guild let's another mow them down 10 times and then do the same to the first guild, then that will get them in trouble.
---
Ill be rolling a druid. Gonna go skinning enchanting for leveling. Skins for some extra muns and enchanting till 265 for smoking heart of the mountain. After that flowers and brewing to support our casual guild and make some golds!
---
Mentioning shadowguard (or any of the priest traits for either undead/troll) for raiding is pointless, as you won't get any benefits from any of them while raiding.
---
You keep trying to run away from the argument, undead is hands down the best priest race for pve. do you have anything to counter that argument? 
---
Next, wpvp shadow guard does decent damage and can proc blackout yes, it's definitely good but DP's healing factor outscales anything shadowguard can do, the healing alone can win you fights, it has a high mana cost but inner focus is practically made for it tbh.
---
Touch of weakness can be used as a pseudo 1xcharge shadowguard to proc blackout, the damage is negligible though but it costs practically nothing to buff urself with it, you can even use R1 ToW if you don't want to use any mana at all, it's good vs rogues as it can mimic shadowguard's opener counter stun that you obviously love.
---
Hex of weakness and touch of weakness reduce the same amount of physical damage, hex of weakness is a curse though while touch is magic, the healing reduction is decent vs healers but druids can remove it.
---
Vs dwarves DP is less effective, considering the opponent is aware that DP was used and counters with stoneform , there are work arounds for that though as you can fear then DP for higher uptime.
---
In wpvp undeads are ahead of trolls in terms of overall prowess , not by too much but it's still clear that undead is better.
---
Since we're on the topic anyway we might as well mention that cannibalize is very useful for leveling as it or in situations where you are low on mana and/or would rather save ur mana , a fear into cannibalize and bandage can get you to 100% hp if you were almost dead, it's not very significant but it's a good addition to add here since we're comparing.
---
In comparison troll's regeneration is garbage and beast damage is only useful sometimes , even druids aren't always shapeshifted so the bonus doesn't always apply.
---
Overall though trolls aren't bad, but undead are generally the better option.
---
That requires effort.
---
15 dollar
---
Can you send me a link showing how Mc is overturned in PServers? From what I’ve read so far parry/hit are undertuned on pservers and no one knows armor or resistances from vanilla. 
---
Obviously the server will need money before pets, or literally any item, is worth anything. Everyone knows the cheapest time to buy anything in the game is when the game is in its infancy. 
---
I just think you’re wrong about the fire protection pots. It’s such a easy/cheap thing to buy/make to make the boss encounters infinity easier that any guide that wants to avoid wiping at all would be foolish not to get them. 
---
I stopped reading because the guide may be focused near end of the server life, but the items listed in it are the important items throughout the life cycle of classic. What’s important in the beginning? Quest items and pre-raid BiS. After that the smart money makers will be investing in twink gear while it’s cheap.
---
Having to cancel shapeshift to do almost everything is kinda restrictive like using items
---
You don't need to "choose" one spec in Classic.
---
You can spec as Retribution, and keep an extra set of int/mp5/spirit gear in your bags.
---
If you enter an instance, swap to your healing set. You can heal as "retribution".
---
Up until you're close to lvl 60, you can respec as holy and grind your way to lvl 60 (in dungeons). Or you know, just level as ret until lvl 60 and then respec.
---
Bull crap lol... repairs yes.  Respecs?  What guild in their right mind would dump 100g on a tank's respec twice in a week, when that money could have been better spent on flasks for that same tank?
---
This YouTuber has the voice of an Alliance player for sure lol

Gold sellers exists in FFXIV and it's fine.
---
Fuck AF
---
The GCD does indeed get reduced, I forget where it was said but a dev specifically said that it does
---
Congrats u saved 2 mins on launch
---
So by your logic if there was a bug / exploit in Vanilla that allowed you to one shot Kel'Thusad and that had never been fixed, should it be in Classic too ?
---
I dont think you understand how compromise works.
---
&gt;1: Dire maul tribute: in diremaul tribute runs (Which was not a thing in real classic.) the boss should be charging you, on private servers this is not the case, you will have to duo or trio to be able to do this, and even then if you duo you need atleast AQ40+ gear to be able to kill him fast enough and keep up with the healing, there is no way with molten core gear or BWL gear that you will be able to duo this guy down if he charges you, this is abit iffy, but I will stand by with this, It wont work, even if it works, you need phase 3+ gear, goodluck making gold before then.
---
Solo DM tribute runs in vanilla were a thing.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mtdik-, but pretty rare.  Stealth groups were fairly common though.
---
True in theorie, but the layer abusers will take more than intended and the rest will have less.
---
Economie wize not much would chance expect the ecomonie grows faster with 3 times the amound of players.
---
Undead mage &amp; orc shaman. Theres just a \~95% chance whit these that they are into pvp and looking for trouble, and that they didnt pick those for rp reasons.
---
UD Spriests are memers that just want to look like total edgelords when ganking someone every 2 minutes. Troll Spriests are superior for both pve and pvp, because they get a "lightning shield"-spell with NO CD which does shadow dmg and can proc blackout even while they are in a stunlock.
---
We've been burned before...
---
The version of AV doesn't change anything. People on pservers rush objectives in 1.5 AV just like in 1.10 AV. It's 100% a player-mindset driven experience and that's how most people are used to play AV in the past dozen years, both on retail and pservers.
---
People have been rushing AV for the highest honor/hour since 2.0 and free R14 gear in TBC pre-patch and that's not going to change. The gear incentive is stronger than the pvp incentive.
---
I am chilled my friend. Waiting for Classic :)
---
It can't be paladin because Trolls can't be paladin.
---
And Troll is the ultimate lvl 1 twink race. Their racial which allows some portion of your health regeneration to work inside of combat. And at lvl 1, you have a crazy base health regen. So Trolls at lvl 1 excel.
---
Then you look at the class, which would be priest or shaman. You need to be able to heal or you won't win against other healers at lvl 1.
---
I think Shaman will be the best option, you have Rock Biter weapon which is a good way to deal damage without using mana. And healing wave. A priest needs to cast smite, a shaman can just hit you.
---
So:
---
Troll Shaman.
---
If it's not intended by Blizzard then it's a bug. They decided that already. And it's very clear that their decision is that it's an exploit as you can and could get banned for it. It doesn't matter how easy or hard it is to counter, it's unexpected behavior as seen by blizz.
---
Troll's have crazy health regen at lvl 1.
---
I the FoV still wrong? No1's mentioned this so I'm hopeful but I don't have beta to check.
---
Ridiculous example, there’s no way that wouldn’t have been fixed
---
They have AOE fear.
---
For a lot of people, fighting other players is infinitely more satisfying than scripted boss fights. Even if I have to do those scripted boss fights to have the gear required to compete. 
---
Overcoming an opponent(s) you should lose to is a huge fucking rush. Be that a gear imbalance or a class mismatch.
---
This idea that people who like PvP *only* target lowbies (especially when dishonorable kills were a thing) is not even close to accurate. And not to be a dick, but that mindset is usually just a coping mechanism for frustration.
---
I absolutely think you should avoid a PvP realm. But I also think that means you enjoy an incomplete game.
---
Holy fuck. Havent played WoW in years but still gonna use this one lol. It looks sick as shit
---
Hydra does it in 1 hour on a priest
---
I believe it was bugged all through vanilla to not reduce the GCD, but from what I've heard it's been fixed on the beta, so down to 1s gcd.
---
Getting under Stormwind is a bug, getting to Hyjal and Quel’Thalas is a bug, yet things that people loved about vanilla. Should all that be fixed too?
---
FFXI had pretty brutal XP loss for death, especially for a game where bosses could 1 shot a group of players.
---
I do not, but I have a pretty good idea of what it entails to make something like this
---
Its says "Video not available" sorry.
---
And yes I was hinting at solo runs, group tribute runs are still a thing, just like on private servers.
---
Luckily we've all grown up since and it will be a completely different experience in Classic, right? Right!? RIGHT?
---
Right... you can't think in in hourly terms.
---
Right now one of my ongoing projects has a weekly delivery which takes me around 4-8h to complete and is worth around 1k (client estimate) 
---
8 years ago it would have taken me around 60+ h to complete 
---
If I were charging by the hour I should have made more when I was less skillful... 
---
This example is obviously a extreme but still illustrates one of the reasons why you can't charge hourly for art
---
Sitting in brown shittrath and running dailies is dull af.

NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION

Two night elf rogues in our guild, Vondutch and Vonzipper. They are gf/bf in real life. One day there is massive drama (I think she cheated on him) and in retaliation Vonzipper posts nude pictures of her ON THE WOW FORUMS. The post was taken down quickly, but not nearly enough: a lot of people had seen it. I was only 13 or so around the time, but some of my older guildies told me the pictures weren't too flattering =\[ .
---
Funny how these memories work; I haven't spoken to, played with, or even thought of Vondutch and Vonzipper in nearly 14 years, but I can so very vividly remember their names/characters, and the exact Sunken Temple run I was doing on my gnome mage when the news hit on that fateful day.
---
There were a few spots that you could abuse if you knew them on LH, for example epl at scholo. Multiple nodes respawn inside each other, and they respawned very quickly
---
I never said she was an object. I'm not talking about how things ended up, I'm not talking about what she did, I'm talking about your friend. Hitting on a woman in a relationship is a scummy thing to do. Full stop.  
---
And she's not who she is because of him, she's who she is because of her. Him poking at her to lose weight isn't what made her lose weight, it was her own dedication to changing herself. If they're happy together, great. That's wonderful news. It doesn't change the fact that your friend (who may be a wonderful person by every other metric, I don't know the guy from Adam) began things in an amoral fashion. Good people sometimes do bad things, and your friend did a bad thing. The ends never justify the means. This is not difficult to understand.
---
Alright man, have a good day! Nice talking :)
---
&gt; People have become so used to betas being glorified demos, that an actual beta which has people conducting tests and reporting bugs (and said bugs getting fixed on the regular) is being treated as the final product.
---
The other main issue is that most of the top streamers/youtubers people watch to see footage of the beta aren't doing testing or even treating it like a beta.  They are mostly treating it as a finished product that they have early/exclusive access to.
---
This creates a problem where the content creators will, rightfully for their prosperity/longevity, focus on entertaining content rather than deep dive testing.  Then the audience just sees them having fun and starts thinking that the game is ready.  However, this also leads to overreaction outrage when something isn't "right" and, since people assume the game is ready, the game is now ruined forever.
---
There are some content creators that are doing some awesome testing videos ([Perplexity with the leeway videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE)), but they are more of the exception than the rule.  This is one of the drawbacks of having the top streamers/youtubers being the face of your game when it is in beta.  They shape a lot of the perspective that people have of the game through their audience, but they also need to entertain the audience and most testing just isn't entertaining.
---
I still remember that shit. Was before I swapped to horde. Ironforge breeders is 10000x better than horde imo
---
I broke down in tears man, lovely story!
---
There are plenty of bad players of every other class for them to kill.
---
Great Beta. Instead of letting people in that truly test everything. Shouldnt they test every quest there is instead of zerging around STV Arena?
---
Not comparable as it's not relevant to PvP. You never got banned for going to hyjal or into the caverns of time and so on. I used to do this all the time and it was part of my enjoyment too. It seems like this is a gray area. You're not hurting anyone here and it seems that blizz won't punish you for it. However, if they want to prevent that, there's not much we can do. I'd be against it in open world scenarios. In battlegrounds exploiting should be fixed and banned.
---
So what ? If your local Ungoro mafia is too obvious, I can can assure you they will get banned fast.
---
Sure but they should atleast be earning more than beggars or people on social welfare, especially if they're working on commission and not on a steady hourly/monthly wage.
---
\~150$ for "a few days work" couldnt even pay the rent in many EU countries.
---
I still have my lvl 29 ret paladin from classic that is geared with mostly leather and agility gear. Agi is great for paladin.
---
But then you kill a gnome and eat hes liver
---
\#Rossdidnothingwrong
---
&gt;key difference is that a lot of people would enjoy it and find it an interesting experience
---
I think you are wrong, it's hard to tell someone what they should enjoy and what not. 
---
This is basically you saying: "You are having fun the wrong way."
---
I have levelled roughly 4 paladins in vanilla and TBC.  2 to level 40, one to 60 where I cleared BWL and raided into Naxx and AQ 40, and another I levelled to 70 in TBC.
---
Don’t do holy, there is no upside.  One of the 40s and the 60 were levelled holy.  It was awful, but the game was new and I didn’t know wtf I was doing.  It’s probably not so bad if you can manage the downtime but Ret hits harder with less mana usage and downtime ,  more utility and has pursuit of justice. Prof allows you to aid grind.   Oth specs can heal easily through the levelling process with a heal set.  There is no reason to level holy.
---
It was not, but I'm laughing at the couple of different replies that point to this being more common than I thought!
---
The post is about pvp not pve. Notice how i didnt mention pve at all in my comment.
---
Clearly you arnt convinced but all im saying is that most known spriests have been convinced. Troll has been accepted as the meta for a few years now. But dont worry you wont be far behind at all as undead.
---
nice !  i gotta use this aswell  
---
RemindMe! 2 Months "Make these macros"
---
Yes
---
Male Orc Shaman. Playing a Paladin in Vanilla Shammy was just not my class to fight in 1v1.
---
nice !  i gotta use this aswell
---
 Yeah you are clearly clueless.
---
 Which of top private servers were open core lol, stock mangos was/is dogshit and nostalrius and other notable priv server applied tons of fixes and entirely changed it, basicaly from ground up. Nostalrius passing over core to Elysium wasnt "open source development", but rather a giveaway of their work so people can play the game.
---
 Also are you actually trying to convince me private server has better resources for developing a game than Blizzard? One of the biggest game development companies vs 20ish fans of the game that has different day jobs lol... Also what rushed blizzard to release now? Why not take another year? ALso they been developing this for 3 years plus. Anothing thing, why not increase team size then? Funds shouldnt be a problem for multi billion company right? 
---
 To answer second part of your question, how is that not game breaking? People playing hunter will have terrible time (p.s. top secret - almost all classes are very broken, so yeah this is global issue even for someone like you).
---
 What more important bugs? Class mechanics is extremely high on priority list, do you really have this low standarts for a game? No wonder blizzard cucking its community for years, you seem to enjoy that in some weird way.
---
I stopped playing on private servers once classic was finally announced, the past few years specifically there has been a lot of issues with private servers opening and closing or just ran poorly, etc. 
---
So in my opinion at least classic is a stable environment, like it or not if you play on a private server no matter how long you do you pretty much have to accept the fact that everything you’ve done could be gone in a heart beat any ways. That sort of thing is less likely to happen with classic.
---
That sounds exactly like my old GM. He was a priest that thought stacking int was more important than +healing/spirit/mp5. We did eventually get nef down before it all fell apart, at least.
---
There are already speedrunners on the beta using an addon to do the exact same thing. So if it works on the beta, it will almost certainly work on live.
---
Lol pretty accurate for the most part. I remember when I 1st started playing back in the day I used to roll on alli bc of friends (even tho I always secretly wanted to be horde) but the first friendly horde I ever met was a male Tauren &amp; he actually escorted me through STV all the way to booty bay bc I was a low lvl tired of grinding and just wanting to explore. In fact he was so nice he did all of that looking past my disability of being a gnome of all races lmao, looking back I would’ve punted my ass all the way back to dun morogh 😂 Anyway it was an awesome experience &amp; Tauren have been my fav race for a while now
---
Cant wait to see some moonkins /dance ing in cities
---
The most soul crushing part of Sharding.
---
Really subverts my expectations when that happens.
---
Lol at going back to retail. 
---
Blizzard needs to Let us in the beta to finish the testing now.
---
Does anyone know of any Undercity desktops? Or perhaps Tirisfal Glades? There’s just something about those creepy Agamand Mills that fascinates me. I love the nostalgia of being an undead mage questing there. One of my favorite zones for sure. :)
---
Boy you sure are dense.
---
This reserving thing must be a private server thing or a US only thing.  If you said you wanted to "reserve" an item in an EU party, you'd get laughed at and told to roll like everyone else.
---
What's restro
---
Go away with that bloody strawman.
---
Fixing an exploit doesn't lead to LFR, or anything else that the Classic community doesn't want. Why? Because the devs aren't mentally retarded.
---
Thats not why guys play (they still do) female characters.. but for that person you'd be right.
---
Restoration shaman, sorry about that I’ll edit it
---
Human female Pala
---
Level quickly as I can as ret with skinning
---
At 60 go 32/19/0 drop skinning and level herbalism then use money from that to power level engineering.
---
Start on prebis.
---
Shaman is way cooler but priest is the true group healing boss, heals main tank and group whereas shaman filling gap in true hybrid fashion. I’m recommending shaman to my learners who don’t want to do melee damage or range damage/cc.
---
Start with human warrior, skinning / mining for leveling, switching skinning to engineering later on.
---
Leveling quickly and efficiently, since I have quite a lot of experience from various classic servers, spec prot at 60, farm gear from the dungeons, like Ironfoe and Hand of Justice from BRD, and switch to fury a little bit later on for raiding.
---
Don\`t know yet what my first alt will be, except for an banking-alt, ofc.
---
...you dungeon power lvl. Your not doing quests. Or your grinding faster. Someone boxing to power lvl those chars and make 5x the money all for 1 person. Not sure if they are going to have refer a friend on this but that's another issue.
---
If you want #nochanges #classic experience it should be a bugfest
---
You'd make the party yourself and reserver it beforehand, obviously, tanks do this to have orb runs, if people dont like it then they're not allowed to join.
---
People still want items in the dungeons and gear, so it doesn't matter to some people that you take the orbs. (Or you can do it like some people and only reserver the first orb, the rest are up for grabs.)
---
Go to will it classic. We used curse back in the day to find and download them.
---
I played on the US/Aus/NZ server Proudmoore till i left in cata and having having a 24h player base was great. wow isnt the fastest paced game so latency wasn't a big deal until cata when Bliz decided dps needed to have more 'fun' and made us raid interrupt bitches which became a lottery at 250-400ms
---
You’re not hurting anyone with this either because you can go up there yourself and kill them
---
What if there was an exploit in Vanilla that allowed you to abuse game mechanics in order to gain 50% more health and deal 50% more damage? Sounds pretty broken, right? Well, it exists in Vanilla and it's called World Buffs.
---
Thing is, a lot of exploits that were not intended by the devs were often put on hold to be fixed later on or simply skipped over entirely, depending on severity and how many people used them. The ability to have people be out-of-combat during boss fights in order to resurrect people mid-fight wasn't fixed during 1.9, and the ability to corpse rush into the instance during a boss fight and keep on fighting wasn't fixed until 1.11.
---
Saying that "if it's in 1.12, it's not an exploit" is blasphemy.
---
It’s a butterfly effect. The devs have lead us to BfA, why would you have high expectations that they have some code of honor?
---
I’m a gnome in RL
---
A lot of the pserver people will have to quit them, simply because they're planning on shutting down after classic release
---
Did someboday said we are melting faces?
---
Assuming the warrior will be doing the tank, the priest will be doing the healing and not spriest, I’d say practically just any type of dps, maybe a mage, for the drinks and etc, or lock for the health stones? Or if you want a little more survivability, a Rogue?
---
Really? I had no troubles with doing the normal quests in the starting zone as a NE. Sure there was some competition for the mobs closest to spawn area (familiars) but it was fine. I played on server 15.
---
that would actually be cool
---
altho alliance so close to undercity?!! heathen, I spit on you alliance!
---
Rogue, rogue and rogue seems like a pretty solid combination to me
---
I'm going dwarf paladin to clease all those poisons with stoneform! Also spinning pigtails are awesome.
---
yeah i mean even the fact that hunters dont scale that well, their pvp utility is insane
---
A lot of stuff is “broken” in vanilla. Mage AoE farming is broken. Hunter soloing max level bosses is broken. If you want all that shit fixed it won’t even be vanilla anymore. Why make BfA 2.0?
---
I hope I get to gank this gay.    
---
I love killing gnomes.
---
I know this is already old but what is this gnomer hammer you’re referring to?
---
(Template if anyone wants it for his own use : [https://i.imgur.com/uxVhLHk.png](https://i.imgur.com/uxVhLHk.png) )
---
Lol woooow there it’s 2019
---
5 people that know what they're doing, at least one must be a healer.
---
I used to get offended at that kind of comment because my first character was a Tauren hunter.  Then I started playing other classes and discovered that hunters are, in fact, universally retarded until about level 50, at which point some of them gain half a clue.
---
I have no idra where you got that from. Killing people when you're in a raid will give you like 2 honor per kill. Killing someone when you're solo will give you 100-150 honor. Rankers will go duo ganking or solo.
---
STVietnam will be awesome. I'm going to do so much. There will be blood everywhere!
---
This is called Clutch, all our fondest classic multiplayer memories are defined by it! Winning when it seemed like we were for sure lose. 
---
I hate how this feels gone from the game. The intricacy of role skill and group nuance fell out of the game with pruning and squishing somehow.
---
Get some
---
We will be warrior, priest and rogue. :-)
---
Rogue and warrior can have a hard time leveling alone, but with my heals they never stop rolling. :-)

The screamish sound they make when their souls go face the angel of death is a delicacy
---
What u guys dont understand is that when AV came out, we didn't really understand or think about capping and rushing to the end GY, or for honor/hour. It was so hard to cap the next one, so how on earth are we gona cap the last one. Things like these brought honor and glory epic moments, discovering new content but AV has been discovered for so long it is like a 50 year old prostitute. That was the mentality for most. Yes some people had the brilliant idea to just cap the last one and destroy the towers, but on my high populated server it almost never worked. Besides, the well known areas where you avoid the npcs and not just die weren't well known so it was hard to do it right. The classic experience will never be remade EVER, at least not for some things, for reasons like the ones above and many others such as social media, raid guides, bis list and theory crafting like top dps classes. But this game will be enjoyable, only dont expect ninja looting videos or leeroy jenkins, people have grown since as this is still world of warcraft
---
Personally I would say hunter or mage.
---
With hunter you could actually use all Drops and would also be a strong 3 man Group. Assuming the warrior could/would tank and the priest going heal, you would have an easy time to find a Group.
---
Mage ... well mage is just nice Overall. Good damage, Food &amp; Water, Portals, CC, "oh shit" Buttons, kiting potential and so an. Its always nice to have a mage.
---
Holy fuck it can't seem to get through your head that layering applies to the entire server, not just high density zones.
---
The struggle is real
---
I mean , I've provided valid arguments and counters to your points and more, I didn't just mention pve but also pvp and you're talking as if there's some secret behind trolls.
---
If you are indeed right about troll you would have actual logical arguments to counter my points which you do not, you cannot claim something is better than another if you have nothing to show for it tbh.
---
Grandiose gestures of " top priests are convinced " remind me of those ads " trainers/professionals hate him because... etc" , big load of Bull tbh.
---
There will be no more invites. Don’t get your hopes up.
---
TBC had the best end game PvP in arena imo. There was a good meta to arena if you played it enough and yes some things were a bit broken but so is Classic WoW.
---
I see nearly everyone fan boy over WotlK but that was the expansion that made me quit WoW because of the "hero class" DK's and destroying competitive arena. But that's just my opinion and I don't hate on anyone who loved and enjoyed Wrath. :)

Guess it is bound to happen when you have groups of at least 40 people playing together regularly Haha.

It's not really up to us to decide what's an exploit and what isn't.
---
Keep telling yourself that while some guy is playing a competitive video game for 14 year old children with several characters at the same time.

I already laid out the reasons in my first comment, Im not obligated to entertain your ignorance lol

Min/eng early on to end up herb/eng with an alchemy/ench alt.
---
By the time this will be an issue you shall know the god powers of your class, rest easy now :)
---
Srs answer, really it doesn't matter much in the beginning, as you level up you will figure it out, mostly it's about mana efficiency, so if you or your bro is in trouble mana efficiency is the last concern and you would use top rank for max heal, but lets say you're in 5man group or 40 ppl molten core and encounter is going smooth(but maybe its a long fight) then you use lower rank to be more mana efficient.(heal will be smaller but everyone is at 60%+ so it's all good)
---
And as I said before, by the time mc40 rolls into your experience, you will know which ranks to use at different times.
---
Those humans have no mercy on those peaceful adventurers in stv..

All hail the F R E S H

Holy shit. This was my guild in classic. Server was NerZhul. My character was Arpp, a paladin.
---
&gt; Vanilla is like ladder from diablo for us private server autists.
---
Damn that is a spot on comparison. Also it's what Blizzard should do with Classic.
---
I don't really care. I'm playing Shadowbringers until Classic is out.
---
But I think you're wrong. They'll invite more to drive hype.
---
Light’s hope... at least spell it right so we might believe you played on it at least for an hour...
---
Their casting animation was shit; all the Horde males used way too much effort casting, it made them look weak.
---
&gt; Instead of letting people in that truly test everything.
---
And who would that be?
---
Actual betatesting is a really shitty, tedious job. That's why people get paid for it.
---
You can dump it on the players, but obviously they're not going to be as dedicated or thorough as actual betatesters. They're players. They play.
---
Would a devilsaur cartell (I mean a mixture of alliance and horde players) even allowed on blizzards servers on a PvP realm? This bothers me the same way "reserved item XY" do. I mean it is not even possible to create characters of both factions on the same realm...
---
Then why yall calling it an exploit

Only with \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]

Not really a jucy drama but guild got a new MT who was geared and had TF. was great for a while and then he didn't log. Turned out he got a month in the slammer. Nothing serious but apparently the magistrate got tired of him being a fuckup and hiding from his problems in wow and said here's your wakeup call. anyway I dont recall him in game again and I heard later he had a missus and kid and things were going well for him.

I had a hunter called ,,Hantah'' because before i played WoW i was playing call of duty a lot and my nickname was ... hunter.. lol :D but i knew i could'nt name my hunter hunter, so i used Hantah (sounds like hunter when you speak it out in german)
---
Dude im not sure I understood  your comment 100% because you got a stroke some when during typing this, but spell batching us emulated server lag, thus leeway is needed.
---
Yeah. I think around 3days 20 hours might be rather reasonable. Probably not during the launch and the worst the zerg but then again.. If they get far enough ahead of the zerg you can do much. Even without layer abuse.
---
I went to an EB or Gamestop to get mine. They split everybody up into Horde line and an Alliance line. Then the employees would lead the groups in friendly rivalries like yelling For the Horde or For the Alliance. Pretty sure it was a midnight thing.
---
Pservers haven’t started with dm, and ai is actually pretty good, better than classic where npcs ignore terrain and pets just don’t work.
---
Let’s not forget about that Mithril cave in the Shimmering Flats as well 👀
---
Here is a solid alliance guide by Hakurai.  It was built for Warriors, and getting the WW axe solo, so it isn't a hardcore mage guide like you want.  However, it seems that the meta for Mage speed leveling is going to be AoE/Instance grinding, so I'm not sure if a mage specific guide for questing is going to be out there.
---
Quite wrong. You are not "so good" at healing. It's simply that you're one of the few who can do it. 
---
There's no "pure" healer unless you count priest as such. And even then hybrids are still most of the healing options (2 out of 3, shaman or pally -depending on faction, of course- and druid).
---
It Ironic to think but kids from this era may have been literally created out of one of these relationships and now come to play classic wow
---
the picture of an undead warlock with silly-scary hairs still haunts me in my nightmares
---
You will almost certainly not hit rank 10 during phase 2.
---
When phase 3 is released and WSG/AV with it, world PvP will take a massive backseat in regards to being able to efficiently rank.
---
Oh ok. Ty!

Because it's unintentional use of gameplay mechanics. That's the definition of an exploit

I hope they fix all this shit , Maybe Arcane missile thing idc about cus why would u ever missile a rog anyway but everything else needs to be fixed
---
EU player here people were reserving items constantly in vanilla.
---
This, exactly.  When you're on the ground you're stuck in the world, you have to negotiate the obstacles around you and actually... you know, deal with the world.  When you can fly, all of that goes away and the immersion of the game world is stripped away.
---
But he understands how marriages work
---
I've played on plenty of private servers and they're all fucked in one way or the other. It'll be a challenge for Blizzard to somehow make it a worse experience than a private server.
---
Undead and human rogues. Both my mains are warlocks and there were many times I just couldn’t get past a rogue.
---
Thats how loot council works bud
---
Well there’s a guy in a wheelchair in the bottom, so yeah, its probably satire.
---
What exactly did you lay out in your first comment? You haven't provided anything besides mild speculation while I've given you solid facts about priests.
---
Your chief anchor argument that troll is better vs priest and paladins isn't even accurate since wotf is stronger vs priests even if you don't use DP.
---
Undead priest is better vs anything besides paladin , situationally trolls are better vs some dwarf classes but shadowguard isn't a reliable form of damage, the damage procced has a cd and can proc on anything so you can't guarantee it will damage the target you intend it to, if you're fighting a mob in the world and a rogue jumps you but shadowguard procs on the mob instead you're literally fucked.
---
It's easy throwing salt off a high horse and calling people ignorant with no real substance to your arguments, you haven't even discredited anything i've said so far with actual debates just insults which makes you look like a fool.
---
Here's another fun fact , undead has higher intellect and spirit stats than trolls, add that to the list of things you can ignore .
---
You just don't seem to understand that even though troll is decent at wpvp, I would even say it's close to undead, it doesn't hold a candle to undead in other aspects of the game which means undead is technically the better choice OVERALL.
---
It's fine to roll a race you enjoy playing, it won't set you back to play a troll at all but spewing garbage about things you clearly desperately want to believe in for some odd reason without actual facts makes you look like an idiot.
---
This post may be too real for this sub
---
I ran with a druid guild back in late vanilla and it was a struggle; rewarding but a struggle. We managed to get through the living side of strat where none of us had MC gear and some of us had PvP items. Not having crowd control is the hardest part but the composition meant we could have a second healer if needed, and also plenty of innervate to go around. With that many druids, not having a res wasnt really an issue because (1) brez is given less weighting and is given the "just use it" treatment unless we were coming up towards the last boss and (2) when we didnt use it the wisp racial actually helped haha and (3) if someone ran back in after they had died and there were respawns they would feel easier to skip.
---
We did try a few stealth runs but mob density in some areas meant we weren't exactly skipping entire instances to get to a boss; we would skip some sections, sure, but not whole instances - part of this was just because we were small and couldn't hold enough 60s online at a time to try things out. Our most popular stealth run was helping the lowbies get illusionary rod from SM, helping druids outside of the guild with the lava swim in BRD and getting the first idol from Roccor. For the SM run we actually found nightscape boots to affect whether or not the two monks before Arcanist Doan would see you (cant remember what actual minimum player level was though) and it wasnt until BC that we started committing to skipping massive portions for stealth runs to farm Badge of Justice.
---
Gear is "ok" as long as people find ways to gear up outside of instances too; particularly for feral. Having no cloth wearers actually made resto the fastest to gear, and this also meant gearing a ferals offspec resto was faster as well so bigger pulls (normal pulls without CC) were less risky.

I mean, economy will not be developed at all at start, mats will probably cost little on the AH, but for the amount of gold the player will have, those mats will probably be extremely expensive. Add to this the fact that most players will bank their gold for the 40/60 mounts.
---
Also, being the first to have certain recipes (quest items, pre BiS raid gear or actual lon lasting leveling gear with big impact) will boost your income by a lot, as well as the server reputation.
---
These are some of the aspects of no changes I don't understand. Even when I heard they were reintroducing spell batching, I didn't understand.
---
You can say it's fun and unique that two mages can consistently poly each other at the same time etc etc, but why would you intentionally make the game less accurate for the sake of nostalgia?
---
This is ultimately what we are talking about too, accuracy and leeway falls in here too. Are you really 8 yards away? Well the answer is no, so the accurate way would be you can't hit it.
---
I'd go a step further too and say even if Internet connections were as shit as they were back then, the games accuracy should not be catering to that. Certainly not to this degree.
---
The exclusivity means very exclusive; there’s not much spell dmg mail gear available, and theres better cloth alternatives
---
Too long didn’t read: refer to my first comment as to why trolls are the new meta
---
Shit like this makes me never want to join blue
---
or the booty bay. with a booty.
---
yh its absolutely bs lol ss vs tm is bad for efficient business
---
&gt;If you want all that shit fixed it won’t even be vanilla anymore. 
---
Well, it's not. It's Classic. I get what you're saying but fixing bugs is not the same thing as changing features.
---
Troll has berserking for raiding and UD has WoTF. Both can be used outside raiding as well but WoTF is more situational (we'll see how many warlocks alliance has this time as this is the counter against pretty much for all their cc, warriors are priests are niche). 
---
Troll has spammable and targetable hex for bgs/duels/wpvp while UD has touch of weakness (it simply weights down enemy healers) while UD has touch of weakness that isn't targetable nor spammable (to increase charges) and only procs on melee hit and reduces damage taken (self buff is only better if melee is able to catch you off guard).
---
Troll has shadowguard while UD has DP. SG scales very well with shadowdamage and it hits equally as hard as DP, but are on global but there is no cd on SG. Both are dispellable (purge) but DP/disease is easier to get rid of for more classes than enemy buff. SG has lower manacost but the only thing that goes for DP is the healing it provides. So in the end one is used all the time and once is saved for emergencies or extra offensives even if cd has recovered.
---
Troll has regeneration while UD has cannibalism. Regeneration (10% increased health regen in and out of combat) scales extremely well with priest leveling (spirit gear) and works all the time while at 60 spriest replace all that spirit. Cannibalism is situational (only works if there's a humanoid or undead corpse nest by) but works as a bandage as it always heals 35% of your health if you're able to fully cast it. Cannibalism is better at 60 in pvp in general as there will be corpses around.
---
Utility: troll has beast slaying (5% more damage against breasts) which is not much but it saves some time in the long run (not much). UD has underwater breathing (300% timer compared to other races) so it saves some time while others need to take breath more often. None are better than the other really. Both are marginal and if there are shamans as much around as it seems then you could give a few coins for that waterbreath buff if you really need it.
---
For me troll takes the cake as long as UD is the most popular race in pvp servers. Undeads are what keeps alliance warlocks in check. If I would see tons of warlocks all the time then WoTF would be much more valuable. I predict that troll will be the caster meta while not most popular pick in pvp servers this time around and only use you find for WoTF is duels against other horde most of the time. If you would take WoTF away from UD you would see how terribly the race compares to troll priests. So the final question is how much you value that extra trinket and how often do you really use that while leveling and while 60.
---
I agree otherwise, but priest is not a highly played class. They’re probably 3rd or 2nd last in popularity, accroding to all the polls and private servers data.
---
...what? lol. maybe if you literally just go full ham immediately at the start? no enhancement shaman is gonna be dealing the damage to pull threat off any tank if theres like 2 sunders on the boss.
---
Because tbc is 10x harder to script for a pserver developer, even some of the best tbc servers have been riddled with flaws. 
---
Plus. TBC is really supposed to be played after a server has progressed through vanilla. That’s rarely the case for private servers.
---
&gt;If it's not intended by Blizzard then it's a bug.
---
It's so stupid that this needs to be pointed out. If it's intended, it's a feature. If it was not intended, it's a bug. It doesn't get much simpler than that.
---
I second this, i did it in T1 and T2 gear respectively as a hunter in vanilla
---
Word lol but I dont worry about them at 60, they can go ahead and try me though np ;)
---
Shaman is great. Just dont be surprised, they will be extremely popular and maybe of the most played classes!
---
(and drillborer disk has no defense...) (not really to do with the fire resist at all)
---
You just said it’s not for us to decide what’s an exploit
---
&gt;It’s a butterfly effect. The devs have lead us to BfA, why would you have high expectations that they have some code of honor?
---
This is the weirdest way to say, "I don't know what I'm talking about or what the butterfly effect is." that I've ever seen.

Hi all. I've updated my previous posted Brill background to be animated. Animations include:
---
* Ever so slightly moving trees
---
* Dust green particles in the sides
---
* Dust green particles off the lamps
---
* Light coming from the tarvern door slowly moving
---
* Smoke coming from the tavern's chimney
---
* Brill tavern music on loop
---
It was my first animated BG, sorry if it's slightly "normal" but I wanted to keep the "dead" feeling to it. Working on a Mulgore one next!   
---
(The video has recoded-like quality, the actual wallpaper is full res)
---
Hit is never really a problem for rogues, on pserver i had like 13% from gear/spec during mc and like 16% in bwl, hit is very useful for rogues since white hits account for like 50% of your dps as combat.
---
You clearly have no idea how warriors work if you think you can't prevent crushing blows. That would explain your ill-informed post.
---
\&gt;  but spell batching means that he's gonna get his sheep off and you're getting your frostbolt off and maybe, defying intuition or logic, you'll also get to counter spell him, all because those casts occurred in the same batch window. 
---
This here is exactly the biggest problem with spellbatching. It would be fine and okay for most abilities and regular attacks. But CC's &amp; interrupts should absolutely not be affected by it, it makes for those weird moments of opponents cc'ing each other at the same time when it shouldnt have been possible or casts still going through even if they were in fact interrupted, or the famous "but the heal went off" memes.
---
Lets see how players are still gonna like spellbatching when a Paladin still bubbles after getting locked out of Holy magic from an interrupt or when every half-decent rogue with good latency always reliably immune-vanishes almost anything (which wasnt originally intended and was basically an exploit).
---
100% correct

All games are pretty much fucked one way than other. Bugs, bad design etc etc. Wow is no differend as a game.
---
 Yes private servers have bugs. Classic has bugs. Bugs being fixed sooner or later. Nothing gamebreaking in most cases. its just people generally like to complain about things.
---
Only few servers i played had been dissapointment or shut down, but thats in 10 years i been a private server player.

I dont get why you are saying its a challenge to make worse experience than in private servers.

Human flesh is okay, but nothing compares to a sweet delicate little gnome. Especially if they come pre-salted with their own tears. That's the best kind.
---
See my comment. About troll shadowguard proccing on mob: the same happens with touch of weakness and the rogue deals full damage on you. Those are situation disadvantages that you picked up that will happen but undead isn't at any better situation there. The thing is that shadowguard is a buff based damage (you have it already and you don't need to be active/you can be stunlocked for days and you still deal damage) that deals as much damage as DP without high mana cost and is instant so it can't be kicked. DP has that or is targetable which I forgot to mention and is situational advantage.
---
Agreement on every single point, and I'll even add to one: 
---
&gt; There's very little agency in leveling.
---
Even worse, with level scaling implemented, there is no longer any sense of progression either. In fact, mob HP rises faster than your damage, even with full heirlooms (which newbies do not have); So you are actually *regressing* in power level until you hit max level, where you can finally start "catching up". 
---
Professions also are completely useless until max level at the earliest; Since every zone scales by level, but resources are still tied to the old "zone levels" (you'll find linen up to 'old' level 15 mobs, wool from 15-30, etc.), newbies will have no guidance as to where they'll find what - and they don't need those resources anyhow, because it's much too inefficient to actually gather enough resources to keep your equipment current - especially since quest rewards do not only level to your level, *they also can roll in a higher rarity*. And, of course, since professions now are split into their expansions, there is absolutely no need to level them before you're in the current one. And *even then*, it may turn out that your profession is just about useless to level, because the gear mill hands out gear 100 item levels above the one you can craft for playing a 20-seconds game of Memory - and the one you can craft would need *hours* of resource gathering.
---
...The "new player experience" in Retail is so completely and utterly borked that there is only one way to ensure it is fixed: Nuke it from orbit.

Hahaha, that whole thread is a goldmine. Shame there aren't too many other threads that got archived.
---
powershifting was in wotlk
---
I'm not only talking about bugs. I'm talking about GM abuse, GM's helping certain players, Devilsaur mafia, guilds colluding cross-faction like crazy, all that good stuff :).
---
It's like they don't even realize that they **are** the joke.
---
Not sure about my *first* character, but I remember my main during the early years very well.
---
It was a NE hunter. A male NE hunter. Yeah I know... HEAVILY inspired by LotR and Legolas, so I named him Trikolas.
---
Haha yikes.. Stopped playing him during TBC when my dad and I transfered both server and faction. I think I got to about 40-something with him when that happend, so never expirienced end game content. My 11 y/o ass was more into exploring and finding pets.
---
Yeah, good luck getting an entire server to avoid getting bis gear for a month &lt;.&lt;

&gt;traveling back for repairs
---
Ow shit - i forgot about this part ... will be interresting :)
---
Will thiss be a daily repost to fish karma ?
---
UBRS is amazing to do as a 10 Man dungeon feels amazing!
---
Also there was a notable difference between 5-man parties (or Groups) &amp; Raids : quests. You couldn't do standard quests in a Raid,  like killing "X monsters" ; If you were in a raid, killing them was not triggering the quest for example. 
---
I don't remember if there were quests marked as Raid Quests , though, which could have been doable in a raid (more than 5 people party).
---
I remember way back when was if people would allow UD to roll for it since it was so similar to their epic mount
---
Nope :(
---
You can't do that consistently. Sometimes your shield block charges just get eaten up too quickly.
---
And, kindly provide me a +130 def set (with phase1 gear).
---
My comment above has a link to it now. You need to install through Steam's Wallpaper Engine (costs 3$ I think, the software Wallpaper Engine, but it's pretty great to be honest, and then my wallpaper is free)
---
Except your not doing it for 1 person. You have 5 characters to repair, to gear and to buy mounts for. You have no idea what your talking about and its a bit funny tbh.
---
If he is having fun I don't see a problem with that
---
Your goal is to outlast him , it's not a dps vs dps fight as you'll lose that everytime.
---
Just spam dispel him before the initial sheep lands and hope you get the barrier off him, sit the sheep and let him open on you, shield urself after initial damage.
---
His initial opener won't be a shatter , the shatter comes next as he needs to stop you from dispelling the nova , so it's typically going to be initial spells into nova /grenade into shatter ( FB/CoC/ FB ) into counter spell and then finish u off.
---
So long as you avoid on stopping the shatter from happening he can't out damage you.
---
You can time frost reflector during shatters or when you're CS'd so you buy time to heal urself after.
---
Your trinket removes fear/stun and sheep, if you trinket a grenade while sitting in a nova you'll only remove the stun, but this isn't a bad thing because you can time frost reflector 0.5 sec before frost bolt finishes casting , trinket grenade -&gt; reflect frosbolt /CoC which WILL shatter on the mage , he'll panic and try to reset and that's where you can fuck him up.
---
You can almost always force a block by silencing then he'll block and you heal forcing him to leave block which you can rocket helm before he cold snaps leaving him standing there while you bandage to full and strip him of all his buffs.
---
After that you know he'll 100% try to sheep you and reset which you can counter by using skull of impending doom, he'll blink away and run then but you can just chase /dot etc.
---
Alternatively you can just start the duel with a silence straight up as that will force the first block and gives you enough time to have silence again in that same duel.
---
You basically need rocket helm/frost reflector and skull every time though.
---
you missed the point, im saying blizzard did hybrids bad in vanilla by giving them abilities and even talent trees made specifically for those causes, but then made them so bad its not even worth looking at, nothing in my post is meant to praise vanillas handling of hybrids because it was abysmal at best
---
Lol you guys make me happy about my life choices. Too fucking much emotional investment for a fucking game.

Im not gonna go put together that set for you, but, in the most common scenario of one boss hitting one tank, there is very little times where a boss can remove the shield block charges before it comes up again. For this reason, on most private servers i have played in recent years (yes, private servers, because there was literally no other way to play classic) people would only put one point into the improved shield block talent because of this.
---
with a hidden third one: you group up with other players and chase them again
---
&gt;I suggest we create a super guild, "The Blacklist" with the explicit  purpose of pushing content as efficiently as possible, with the goal of  hunting those who wish to abuse their streamer privilege to dictate what  others may do. Any and all shall be welcome, and those who we blacklist  shall be hunted relentlessly.
---
&gt;Please refrain from any name calling in the comments, this is about  challenging the ideas presented by sodapoppin and other likeminded  streamers, not witch hunting.
---
You literally said "Let's hunt people down" to "this is """challenging the ideas"""" and not witch hunting", what?
---
Either damage control to not get your post flagged and taken down or you didn't read your own post, anyways while i do think soda's idea is unrealistic and impractical, and will never work, i do think blizzard should issue bans for people who are **undeniably streamsniping, with hard evidence ,** not to be mistaken with baseless accusations as a normal ganker could get falsely banned in the process.
---
In that video soda has said himself, he wants the position of a normal player, with neither the in-game benefits of a streamer, or the in-game downsides of a streamer, he didn't say he never wanted to get ganked, you had put words into his mouth, he said he did not want to be stream sniped, and there is a clearcut difference especially when you are a big streamer, when you're a normal player, you'll be mostly in a 1v1 or occasionally you will get ganked from a pack of people, with being a streamer, you are much more prone to getting ganked by groups which will most likely have more coordination and communication, and if you attempt to escape it will be much more difficult as they will know your path of escape, when you have one single person versus all of this, it is a blatantly unfair advantage, and in my book, immoral to do stream sniping, therefore i have no empathy for if a stream sniper does get banned.
---
&gt; Do you think it's actually possible that we could see a level 60 before someone even goes to sleep on launch?  
---
I would assume that it's a requirement to get worlds first 60. Either never going to bed or two or more people playing on the same account. Also whoever gets first will probably have gotten a lot of outside help. People mailing early quest items,( there are a lot that are just normal drops that can be traded, also stuff like bronze tube, deadly blunderbuss etc). Would assume as well that stuff like having someone else aggro some mob so you can run in finish a hard to do objective etc. Whoever goes for worlds first is going to have planed it out like crazy and practiced it on private servers( which will help a ton even if they are not the exact same thing as classic).
---
Came here to say this, Mages won’t be able to AOE grind as easily without dynamic resplendent in Classic.
---
Exactly my feeling. I quit WOW right after TBC released. The feeling of previous hard work no longer matters killed my interest straight away. I foreseen the future at that point and I wasn’t wrong.
---
The fix for layering is *no interactions between layers*.  At all.
---
You get a layer when you first log into a realm and it's like a separate virtual realm, so instead of having Thrall and Warsong and Sargeras you have Thrall layer 1, Thrall layer 2, and Thrall layer 3.
---
You won't get invites from people in different layers because you'd never have any interaction with them.  They're not on your friends list, or if they are they are 'offline' in a different layer.  You'll always see the same people in the same zones.
---
Small population layers can always be merged and nobody playing will notice anything except that there's more people.  Realms that are growing a lot can get new layers added.  They could even do things like find different subsets of a layer who don't have any friends in common and split them into different layers so that new players never get an empty layer.
---
This would work great for everybody except for pre-existing friends and pre-existing guilds that want to choose the same realm, but the solution to that is really easy: just let people change their layer once per week, or something like that.  Not on a whim changing every twenty minutes or whatever, an actual commitment to play on that layer for substantial time and only that layer.
---

I honestly wish I could remember the first time I dove into Deadmines, but I somehow completely glossed over the fact, that it's basically just a barn in Moonbrook, that has this entire maze of tunnels and the Gooneyesque cave at the end, underneath it.

my recollection of AV was a rather was an unbalanced match with half the Alliance killing Drek pretty much unopposed while the others had a skirmish at the area before the bridge. Server specific i guess. We were alliance heavy pve server and people tended to treat AV like just another raid instance
---
Does die work?
---
He also clicks last stand
---
Pserver loot tables should not be considered comparaboe to retail money gain
---
I'm on a p server and spent yesterday grinding in sos.... found on area with like 12 nodes on 1 minimap screen. Insane
---
&gt; (because i don't believe it exists in phase 1)
---
It doesn't.
---
First first Slt warlock, then shadow priest Gluc till LK. Then he start be Шглук
---
About Hunter and Warlock pets not feeling the same way they did in Vanilla\TBC\WotLK?
---
While the reason for both was to mitigate lag initially batching adds it's own quirks to gameplay (sometimes interesting, sometimes frustrating) making the inclusion imo personal preference, which I don't think you can really say for leeway.
---
Hah. Brilliant. I thought the ending was going to be getting killed by an alliance rogue. Well put together man

---
any news about raiding? will they increase boss dmg? my fear is raids will be cleared within 1 hour.
---
A lot of pots sell and a lot of them is used in PvE as well as PvP. Raids would have to be 50% or less of what pservers offer to make consumables irrelevant... but Free Action Potions still stand.
---
You should have fire prot potions for Rag and Ony, you should have nature/shadow for C'Thun, Shadow for Nelf, Nature for Viscidous, Huhuran and then things in Naxx... plus frost oil, invis pots, shadow and spell power, agi/str/armor/mp5 pots and more.
---
&gt; On private servers (Which is overtuned like crazy)
---
For a guy demanding evidence from everybody for any claim, you seem to not have provided any for your own claims.
---
We know that parry is wrong on pservers (and it's *under*tuned), but we have 0 clue as to the rest.
---
Why are you dishonest here, while the rest of the "guide slam" is pretty good?
---
So.. you just replied to poke the hole in my statement that i pointed out myself or what? Blocked attacks can't be crushing or critical. So.. ?
---
For leveling Alchemy can be very helpful. Also you can make a good income selling potions. Potions can also provide an advantage in PvP. I don't know how it is in Vanilla raids
---
I am not interested in the beta, but I think letting more People Play and test the beta would guarantee that more Bugs would be reported. More Players means more quests done, more combinations of diffferent spells, enviroments and Options to generate Bugs.
---
Nadox is speaking of a dozen Players on the beta Servers.. senseless beta Server if no one is playing

That's fine buddy, you don't have to minmax.

Many people were afraid about undead rouges. I found shadow priests and warlocks more frightening. Orc warrior was also something not to joke about. I used to play gnome mage and because of this hordis hated me even more 😂
---
I would hope for incremental content aswell instead of "a jump" through expansion, but this might not happen, blizzard plan most likely is to release classic TBC after classic wow (if things goes well).

Go back to bed buddy

true vanilla originally had quite attrocious bugs like hydros from diremaul which even rogues could solo with a bow due to pathing :D

please let me know if its conclusive info the imp fix or just rumor :)

We don’t need your orcish filth in this thread!!!
---
Are you counting Onyxia and ZG as part of the "few" here? There are only seven total raids. Those rings are at best only good for two tiers.
---
Of course, either solution gives you plenty of good farming time with no competition. The question really is which solution allows you to do both that and actually play with friends
---
Nature for ouro too, and bugtrio probably.
---
Arcane for skeram
---
Arcane for noth
---
Nature for maexxna
---
Frost for saphhiron
---
Shadow and nature for loatheb
---
Fire for twin emps and faerlina and firemaw too
---
Get your retail stuff outta here

DKP is about rewarding time and effort.  
---
If you are in a guild and spent 40 hours wiping on a boss, you have been an asset to your guild.  A new player joining the guild when you have it on "farm" hasn't had to put in the hours you have.  If he outrolls you on his first raid......you are rightly going to think "Whats the fucking point?"
---
Playing for the team has a breaking point.  If you put in double the time as the guy getting all the loot....it's going to cause problems.  This is why people use DKP.  An element of fairness.
---
That is true. And I think most people want to at least experience those hours long AV games, once. The best part of those AV games is when you or someone else takes control over the match and starts directing people. It's just so bloody hard when half the raid is either afk or hunting herbs/minerals. I have great memories of leading AVs on Nost, and that was when the title of raid leader would be thrown around everytime someone joined. So I had to whisper these randomly generated raid leaders to pass it back every few minutes...... was still a lot of fun though.
---
I heard that pathing is still bad in Classic. So pathing is going to be abuse, a lot. Golds value ? Not anymore.
---
Your rant is not relevant to this discussion, though. You are talking about mechanics and balancing, that is not the same as bugs. 
---
With bugs there is a clear thing not working - it just needs to be fixed. It is not like balancing where community might say one thing needs to be done and Blizzard something else - a bug is a bug and needs to be fixed. For that a ragepost won't help shit. Constructive feedback will. Despite your assumption that all employees at Blizzard are the devils spawn, they are not. People sitting there trying to fix bugs does just that - fix things. To do that they need to know about bugs and with as many details as possible.
---
It will be extremely hard for 2 rogues to sap 2 opponents simultaneously.
---
Back in Vanilla, we were 4 friends without a tank and we ran most of the instance by doing all sorts of cc and kiting. Spell batching was great fun for us
---
A lot of the higher end recipes (flasks for example) come from drops and are pretty rare. The titan recipe for example drops from drek in ubrs and usually ran about 1700g+. It’s definitely a solid profession and can make you a lot of gold if you have the rare recipes. Btw I’m assuming the black lotus is going to be bop until zg or maybe not. That’s also something you should consider since you’ll have to farm your own black lotus which is also pretty rare.
---
Beta has 600 pop with like 5 different layers. That's not how layering will work, they are just testing out the feature.
---
So, when the boss parries you he will hit quicker and remove shield block charges faster than you can apply them.
---
And when you don't have shield block up you don't have the required 102.4% hit table coverage to prevent crushing blows.
---
I recall them saying they patched it, I also recall myself still going to hidden ironforge in Wotlk!
---
Great, but it runs oom in 15 seconds with that build and it dies the second an aoe hits as well.
---
There will always be min/maxxers who will use every advantage they can get just to do it even if its not strictly necessary. The market for these things will always exist.

It will be extremely hard if not impossible, for 2 rogues to sap 2 opponents simultaneously without spell batching

The quests in there alone is like an entire level and the icebarbed spear is super powerful for levelers. 
---
Looting bodies and doing quests in there is what the BG is supposed to be about, but it's just far more effective to rush past everyone and zerg down the boss. Especially on AV weekends.
---
Ah, you hadn't made your edit to the original comment yet when i replied. That's true, but we can always just take extra points in improved shield block to remedy that.
---
This sub literally takes away hype from me for Classic. The magnitudes of overreaction due to some minor changes that arent even 100% sorted out yet is so annoying.
---
15% - "WTF, I want a *insert eastern european country excluding the rich ones*server for me and my 23 family members"
---
fixed
---
If you picked 39 people I know at random at least 10 of them would have dirt like this.
---
!RemindMe 5 months
---
That kitty does not look happy.
---
Same with spell batching too, though.
---
"Hey lets make the tick rate for spells long enough to where two spells, even though cast at slightly different times, will go off at the same time."
---
I mean I'm not saying the same thing can't happen with touch of weakness but you can apply a damage reduction to the rogue while you're stunned so you take less damage from that perspective.
---
Either way shadow guard is also prone to being dispelled, especially in priest vs priest fights or vs locks with felhunter, which is why I said undead is better vs those.
---
Vs rogues troll is arguably better if shadowguard procs blackout but if you ever get out of the stun lock devouring plague instantly tips the scales back in your favor.
---
Shadow guard is conveniently mana efficient, it's technically better for sustained fights but  it's damage isn't comparable , devouring plague's base damage at max rank is 900 shadow damage while shadow guard does 116 x 3 = 348 damage, obviously I'm comparing how much damage each spell does in it's full duration not the individual ticks.
---
Comparatively DP is incredibly good in burst situations where you need that edge, which is what most wpvp battles are, the only downside to that argument is obviously that it can be dispelled but then one of the classes 
---
(priest) that can dispel also has a fear and charm spell.
---
Either way troll has some good matchups vs some classes but so does undead, the tipping point would be that undead is also the better race for pve.
---
Falmar, human rogue
---
Pathetic.
---
&gt;Apparently our main healer just lost his virginity
---
Damn. You lose 20% healing after that.
---
Extra points in improved shield block don't remedy that. Those 2 points are utterly useless.
---
You still get at most 2 charges every 5 seconds. If you get attacked 3 times in those 5 seconds the 3rd attack can be a crushing blow.
---
And how does that have anything to do with the suggest invite function? It is just a quality of life thing. If it is in  i don't have to type out my friends name with a weird "symbol" in it and explain for the leader how to type the weird symbol, I can instead just suggest invite to this guy and say that he is a good dude.
---
I think that is a great idea! But there is room for improvement.
---
Instead of layering the Mobs we can use the current System. But for every 1000 Players in my layer - Blizzard will spawn 3000 non moving afk "Players" in the world just not doing anything.
---
That way they don't steal my Mobs but I also don't feel like I'm alone! :P
---
Haha someone gets it.
---
Ouf that talent + class trinket from bwl makes the imp bonkers :P
---
I think even if they were the most interesting mechanics in the world the fact they're inaccurate is enough of a reason not to do it.
---
If I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons and make it so that every time I roll an 18 it counts as rolling a 20, and every time I roll a 3 it counts as a 1. That might cause some "quirks to gameplay" but ultimately its artifical and not accurate.
---
In a game where you are potentially fighting other players this extends beyond personal preference.
---
&gt; The Improved Shield Block talent of protection tree adds 1 extra block  and duration for + .5 seconds every talent point , for up to a total of 4  blocks and 6.5 seconds can be achieved from 3/3 improved shield block.  
---
So you're saying this is wrong?

&gt;The shaman didn’t have a mic or cam though,
---
What was it about that time period that people couldn't afford to go to walmart and get a $20 mic?
---
Was playing on a private server that had a cool system of making your own class by allowing to purchase talents and abilities from all classes, using the wotlk classes but capped at 60. Was great but sadly for me all servers where pvp. I had no interest in pvp in wow, if I wanted to pvp I'd play a game designed for it. I learned quickly that Tauren are peaceful, orcs and trolls are cowards who will fight when they have either the number or level advantage and undead are scum. I got so bad I had to stop myself after killing a low level undead. Two weeks later I didn't stop myself and just went around in a pvp build for world content and just started being the aggressor because if you are passive you will just get ganked once there numbers build up. 
---
I also later learned when playing retail on horde that it is simply true, undead players 9/10 times are pricks, not surprising given there lore but it's kinda weird that WoW made me racist. When playing horde I noticed alliance where a lot more passive with the only exception being humans who had a higher chance of being the aggressor.
---
So what? People beg for the pure Classic experience, yet whenever they deliver it as correct as possible, people continue to complain, moreso arguing it was just due to "technical limits". Classic isn't intended to be developed for the sake of releasing an improved, upgraded version of current WoW. Instead, it's solely for paying homage to the original version of the game.
---
What about batching? Should that be removed as well then?
---
So he can use more than 2 keybinds and won't keyboard turn, I see no problems here.
---
Also happened to us. And our MT and OT had one each already so we ended up completing two TF in one week. It was absurd.
---
&gt;and rather than living alone the wife started dating and eventually marrying the creepy dude.
---
I'll be honest, I didn't see that one coming.
---
I found holy were harder to kill, fuck that heal over time passive being a class that crits quite a lot.
---
I mean in the clip he's waiting 5minutes for mobs to respawn. This is exactly how long it takes for mobs in the beta version of the game to respawn. It doesn't seem that far-fetched as people in this thread seem to be making it. I would be more concerned with accuracy of Experience per kill+experience per level than I would about respawn times. His pulls were decent waits inbetween it's just such large quantities.
---

But how do you even know you outscale them, if you never see them in equivalent gear?

LOL 4 SHIELD BLOCK CHARGES?

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH OH BOY.

No, Shield Block adds 1 charge and 0.5-1-2 seconds to Shield Block duration.

Oh boy, 4 Shield Block charges.

That's a quote from one of the wow wikis. Further down it states: 
---
&gt; 📷 [**Patch 1.6.1**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.6.1) **(02-Aug-2005):**  Fixed a bug where Rank 2/3 of the talent was not granting an extra  block for each of the talent points on improved shield block. 
---
You sure? We're gonna be on 1.12
---
Then ur old enough to make your own healer.
---
Just give him food on time and everything will be fine.
---
It's not loot boxes, it's surprise mechanics.
---
I love Outland's design, but it's very "levelish" and linear, in the sense that you go there in a specific order, mop up quests, and never go back. Everyone who levelled to 70, likely had the **exact** same experience and progression. 
---
This is Vanilla's greatest strength: the world feels relevant, from early to late game, and there's a certain non-linearity, which creates a sense of exploring an organic world, rather than just progressing through levels.
---
A better choice would've been to remove Shattrath and most trainers/vendors from Outland altogether, and add more than just one Dark Portal between Azeroth/Outland (perhaps two per continent). That way, quests and factions could be better intertwined between the worlds, and Outland to act as a high-level expansion -- rather than an outright replacement. 
---
Instead, in one big swoop, TBC made everything in Azeroth more or less irrelevant, and that's probably why I can't fully appreciate it. Beyond that though, TBC is very polished and meaty, with upgrades on just about every front: pvp, pve, talents, professions, interface, etc. 
---
I can definitely understand why some people prefer it over Vanilla.
---
You're too smol they don't see you.
---
What do you mean warriors don't use staves?
---
true, but once the phase is out there will be plenty of time to farm the rep
---
I understand your logic behind trolls, they're strong for sure but I fail to see why this makes undead weaker ?
---
if we're only talking about wpvp then they're pretty equal in strengths but when it comes to pve , raiding specifically, undead has always been the best choice, not just for priest but any ranged class typically because of the way groups are built on horde.
---
I can't tell you how many times I've seen orc warlocks and troll priests run around feared on some boss fights while undeads aren't phased.
---
Obviously it's not that big of a deal, you can play any race/class combination and function well in any scenario in the game, I'm only talking from a general perspective.
---
You would want to look into a DPS (assuming Warrior = tank and Priest = healer). For instances, something with crowd control seems good (Mage, Hunter, Rogue). The last two have the added benefit of not needing to roll for the same gear most of the time.
---
All in all, though, he/she should play what he/she finds most interesting. 
---
FYI: we are with five and are rolling Druid (Feral), Warrior (DPS), Mage, Shaman (Healing), and the last person has not figured it out yet :-)
---
What about you only phase to your party member once you are nearby ?
---
You didn't fully used your app.
---
Trust me, it's bugged.
---
If you're going rogue again, beat a warrior through a war of attrition, stack bleeds (they ignore armor) ideal scenario you cheap shot (abuse energy ticks so it costs 20), 2 SS, gouge and try to restealth with 5 cp, sap then expose armor without breaking sap (Use sprint and run through them while hitting the expose armor keybind, it won't break sap and you should be facing the opposite way so won't hit with white damage) then you can restealth, garrote, evasion, use your energy for cp then kite to 5 cp and 100 energy, kidney shot, next 5 cp goes on rupture (keep kiting to abuse energy regen)
---
This isn't hard and fast "You'll always beat the warrior" but it's a great tactic against average warriors and an acceptable one against good or better warriors, it ain't fullproof though.
---
Transmute arcanite bars will be a life saver for the profession. And potions will always be in demand since people will play the game more to the max of their ability when it releases. Potions are part of this.
---
The drugs blows...
---
It wasn't until this very moment that I realized I'll be able to smoke marijuana and play world of warcraft. I'm going to have to reevaluate what class I'm going to play now.
---
Gnome warrior, name will be Taurenshaman.
---
You’re entirely wrong. Old AV would go on until people could summon the death bosses and then you would be able to push to the other teams base. You would either get stuck at alliance bridge or the field of strife. AV received constant changes that made it weaker. This isn’t TBC this is true classic AV they just went with a bad version. No players at all can rush the real version of AV it’s literally impossible for those matches to end in less than 3 hours unless a team lets it happen.
---
My first char at Vanilla release was a male nightelf hunter named Azshara... worked out for me for about 6-7 Month, then someone reportet my Name and i was forced to change it :D
---
Average and no
---
*Laughs in Holy Paladin*
---
Did you ever find out why that happened?
---
you could just remove layering past level 40.
---
Its a mechanik to smooth the launch hype and most of the ppl that try it out wont ever hit 40+. If we have a large number auf 60 so layering is requeried its a big problem, but seeing blizzard planning to turn of layering in p2 they count on alot of ppl quitting early.
---
Broken Islands!

&gt;I don't want the discord because it will give people an excuse not use the in game tools.
---
You get money from crafting fees so you have to be one of the first with the patterns. Aside of that you need minig beforehand to have mats for skilling up those professions. Lotus of mats and money
---
Can you make some money? Sure, with certain specific items in engineering if you go goblin(i think) and if you get some rare blacksmithing recipes early you might be able to earn a few bucks.  
---
Will you be generating much money? Oh god no... Not in the slightest.
---
If you're right then I apologize.
---
It depends on which site is correct I guess. The way I remember it, it was only 2 charges no matter how many talent points you put into it.
---
If you are correct though crushing blows, even if theoretically still possible, are a miniscule chance outside a selected few encounters.

Did anyone ever figure out who the real racist voting against him was? Or he is still out there somewhere?
---
Is my only choice Warrior?
---
I’m in a group 5 of my very close friends.
---
Friend 1: Rogue
---
Friend 2: Warlock
---
Friend 3: Mage
---
Friend 4: Restro Shaman
---
Now I being the only one who hasn’t chosen, I see that Warrior would complete and make this an amazing 5 man team, but I don’t want to be forced into this role, but I feel like if I chose anything else it would mess things up for our group, but my entire WoW career of a decade and a half I’ve played Hunter and Warlock, I don’t mind trying something new but Warrior in classic doesn’t seem my style, always needing a healer by my side isn’t my thing as I love to be a good 1v1er, which a Warrior is not great at. I like range, burst damage (which Warrior does have luckily)
---
I will be doing hardcore PvP and very casual raids, we want to do each raid, but just eventually, doesn’t matter how long it takes us, we love PvP, but still find raiding fun.
---
Should I suck it up and choose Warrior for the team? Or pick something purely out of what I like alone?
---
Oh I know how to do it, but I'm not going rogue this time; tired of busting my ass as a rogue lol, not to say that rogue isn't fun to play. Going with paladin/warlock for free mounts and utility.
---
It’s almost as if you’re in a beta with the capabilities of reporting bugs
---
That's fair, rogues are fun in small scale PvP but they lose a lot of fun elsewhere
---
Just found one I'll definitely be using to bait kicks - Evergreen Pouch, an item you get from a Thunderbluff to combine Un'Gorro Soil and seeds. Looks like you're casting a heal.

1 week is stretching it, 2 is possible, not sure about the hydraxian reputation though

Is there a need to pot up? probably not.

Well you’re five. I would at least have a tank in the team. If the others are final you should go for war or bear. But it depends on you. I’d prefer the social aspect to it than the game mechanics. However if you’re only getting together once a month I doesn’t really matter. I, for instance, would never be able to assemble five friends in one sitting. So there would always be some degree of freedom in which you would have to get external help for dungeons.
---
Had similar drama in mine. Found out the flirty warlock in my guild was sending nudes to a couple of people in  the guild. When these guys found out she was sending them to multiple people, the guild imploded.
---
It really depends on how fast the phase is, you can get rank 10 in 6 weeks at 11000RP per week.
---
What site are you looking at that says that? Btw, the way you responded, you really lost some respect in this conversation. Especially now that you're saying i can be right. It's possible you remember it like that because of either the bug, or people only putting one point in it. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're remembering wrong rather than assuming you know better because im a "private server boi"
---
I know all these, despell cost immense amounts of mana and against high spelldmg mages i can cost you valueable gcds.
---
Frost Reflector becomes nearly useless against the hybrit build mages and with t2+ they dont need to shatter to kill you.
---
And they wont ever get shatter out anyway, you can just instand despell yourself.
---
Its just overall like the guy said the perception that a shadowpriest is a unbeatable duel class or eats mages is highly flawed, and the later the game gets the "worse" shadowpriest gets.
---
How much we want it now.
---
I am torn between Hunter and Warlock.
---
Hunter for its strong WPVP and the early power spike. Also the ease of gearing up because the competetion isn't that big and hunter uses the tier sets. But I am worried for all the bugs, leeway destroying your ability to kite and spell batching fucking with your ability to scatter+trap.
---
For Warlock I'd like to know how you do in Phase 1 with dungeon blues and maybe a few items from MC. Is your PvE DPS competitive and how are you doing in WPVP at that point? I am worried that warlock isn't fun until you get to higher gear levels which could take a long time with phases.

I took double the amount of time this took to type this to search, and was not getting satisfactory answers. I thought I would reach out to the community to tap into the combined knowledge base. Sorry for wasting anyone's time with my need to get clarity.
---
The main reason you go for alchemy is for arcanite transmute. There are several very good items that needs arcanite bars so the demand is always high, with a 20hr cooldown you can make 1 bar per day or 8 in 7 days, if you really minmax the cooldown.
---
The bars sells for around 30g\~ each I would estimate, or you can sell the trasmute for half.
---
It's nice "free" gold for very little effort that lasts almost the whole classic lifespan.
---
Another guy complaining about bugs in a beta :D
---
yes, I’m sure the solution is more phasing
---
NO CHANGES #faladorRIOT
---
Just pick what you like, it's extremely unlikely a group of five manages to level together all the way. Warrior is fun, but if you plan on being self-reliant, I wouldn't suggest it. Even if you managed to stay together, the only thing you couldn't (easily) do as a group are dungeons. Even then, there are options - you could roll Shaman or Druid and tank these pre 60, or you split up for dungeons.
---
At the end of the day, pick what you enjoy most :)
---
That assumes level 60, and it also assumes hes hitting backet 2 or the very top of bracket 3.
---
While technically correct it is possible and depends on the phase length, I maintain that it's **almost** certain he will not hit that rank.
---
Completely subjective, which is fine. TBC was fun imo and the best expansion by far.

there is a third stress test happening in a few weeks - it will probably be once again, open to all people with an active subscription.  
---
also, at the rate they are increasing the level cap in the limited beta, level cap will probably be increased to 50 in the next week or two. - This will probably result in a lot of people doing attempts to full clear all of the BRM dungeons.

You can't just say that and then not explain what that means.

Agreed, i always hated paladins as a hunter cause they would prolong a fight so much or just escape with bubble/hearth. When i got vipersting duels with the became SO much better.

&gt; Tons of guilds will have MC on farm on week two 
---
I don't think you understand the meaning of the word "TONS". If you mean 1-2 guilds per realm will have MC on farm on week 2...that is not TONS. 
---
If you think that there will be MORE than 1-2 guilds per realm that will have MC on farm on week 2...well, you clearly haven't played Vanilla, except on the undertunned private servers, that are about twice as easy compared to Classic.
---
At most, 3-4 guilds per faction per realm will clear MC in week 3. And even that is a stretch, because I don't see THAT many hardcore players.
---
If you want to clear MC by week 3, you have to be a hardcore player.
---
No not really, crafting fee's isn't really that good of a way to make money.
---
Weaponsmith with arcanite reaper early might be decent, but you have to put in so much effort to get it, that it's really not worth. I wouldn't recommend anyone to leveling BS unless if they are doing it to help the guild with crafts, because doing it for yourself isn't gonna work. Imo go mine+engi and just get someone to craft reaper for you.
---
I remember working with the horde guilds back in the day on Stormscale EU where they pooled their resources and sent them to us on alliance via neutral AH. I remember we killed the server multiple times since everyone stood around waiting for us to open the gates. I remember we had to talk to the horde guilds and reschedule the opening to nighttime to avoid the mass amount of players so the server wouldnt crash and I also remember people in our guilds leaking this information so we had a huge amount of players at the gate anyways.
---
Good times, I miss the old days.
---
I dont think you get my point. Now if you join a party no mather where your party member is, you get phased to his layer.
---
What I'm saying is that laying from joining will not happen if your party member is not nearby. So if you want to dodge a gank, you can only by joining a party  that is nearby and not just any party.
---
It would reduce the amount of layering.
---
True, my bad. 
---
They were acting as if they were both dragons. So for instance, “I’m moving your tail to the side, your wings are sexy” etc.
---
You definitely want to use pots and flasks. But alch is still kinda useless regardless.
---
Yeah, the gl messaged me years later to say sorry. He had been hiding his sexuality for years because of his parents. The new tank was his boyfriend and was trying to keep him sweet as he kept threating to tell his parents.
---
thank you for the confirm :)
---
Bet you won't die there a second time.
---
&gt; Also it's what Blizzard should do with Classic. 
---
No, it doesn't, and no, Blizzard won't. A sub based game will fail if it's a ladder game. Maybe you don't understand that. Only FREE games have ladders.
---
Classic will be developed into Classic+, like it or not. It is the best way to make money of subs...and Blizzard is a company.
---
Private servers are IRRELEVANT. They are free, and ofc nobody gives a fuck on character investment. Hence, the private server meta of rerolling every 4-5 months on new (but also FREE) servers.
---
Classic will NOT HAVE LADDERS, and will not have FRESH servers...until Classic+ is live.
---
with layering, probably 3 days
---
Herbalism is a perennial top tier goldmaker.
---
Just do herb engineering.
---
No real wall jumping no. 
---
You will be able to do small jumps due to how the world is made up where there is natural places to land and such, you can still get under org or SW, and do BG skips and such, but you can't jump up a straight wall like you could in vanilla / early tbc.
---
Spirit is great for warrior leveling
---
True. those things are horrible xD
---
So what is the range of this phasing? What happens if you accidentally run outside his range? 
---
More phasing.
---
Gotta keep in mind that classic servers won't be the size of real vanilla servers either, they're probably gonna be closer to private servers (with layering).
---
I dont drink sodas. Although i'm gonna buy a case of bawls and ofcourse beer for the first week
---
A lot of this are stupid complaints thats true. There is only one thing I‘m worried about and thats the language server stuff. This case shows us that blizzard seems to think there won‘t be enough players and they have the data. They are not stupid. They can see how many people interacted to classic stuff how many people tried to get into beta etc. They know their stuff. This seems to indicate that there are not so many people interested in classic like we might have thought. In this sub we are many ofc but it‘s a bubble for fans. I just hope it doesn‘t die out quickly
---
The range to enter his layer afyer joining his party would be 100-150 range.
---
Ofcource you dont leave the layer after phasing in.

It's not about the loot. It's the quantity of mobs you pickpocket, which I assume would be relatively the same.

Oh it's a serious post. I'm no lifing like i did back when i first started playing. Just trying to find tips on doing it healthy =) As for work with the mini holiday season we're going through right now at amazon and the actual holiday season prep starting in october. It's like a treat for myself

Proof?

Why does it need to be smooth? It just looks like a bugged animation
---
Bless your soul.
---
Experience per kill and level is definitely not wrong. Respawn might be 30sec/min wrong which actually does impact aoe farming a ton.
---
And lastly how many mobs and how they respawn is also a big factor that could change the speed of aoe leveling.
---
Yea i thought of uber eats. But i'm dropping 4k on a pc next month. Gonna need to save every penny i can afterwards

You can definitely replace stuff like the dash macro with:
---
/cancelform [noform:3]
---
/cast [noform:3] !Cat Form
---
/cast [form:3] Dash
---
One thing I like to do is replace "stance" with "form", it works the same way and is more thematic. :)
---
As well as any form into dash or prowl, any form into feral charge is also nice:
---
/cancelform [noform:1]
---
/cast [noform:1] !Bear Form
---
/cast [form:1] Feral Charge

Another useful macro to save keybinds is faerie fire in any form:
---
/cast [noform, harm] Faerie Fire; [form:1/3, harm] Faerie Fire (Feral)
---
Finally, here's a macro that might save another keybind - travel form on land, aquatic form on water:
---
/cast [noswimming] Travel Form; [swimming] Aquatic Form
---
don't confuse imps on pserv with imps on classic as all pserv imps are guesswork as nobody knew their actual mp5.
---
Firebolt costs 115 mana per cast, imp without mana talent has 1898 mana pool.
---
16 seconds to be exact.
---
now then let us add 31+ mage intellect and 15% mana increase from talents we would have ‭2.539 mana enough for 22 casts/seconds.
---
Furthermore the imp starts at 100% upon summon, using 0.5 sec. to resummon a new would bring it back to full if it became an issue.
---
and this is without taking its regen into account which the imp is famous for ☺
---
Quite a lot of bosses are dead within 20-60 seconds and yes the imp is situational but it also reduces threat by up to 20% if talented which is quite usefull \^\^
---
right lets just assume things without even watching a vod or anything.
---
He had 5min respawn timers the whole way.
---
Yeah Blizzard you better have a polished beta without bugs! GOOD JOB ON THAT ONE BLIZZ
---
Solo world PVP... Almost sold on rogue. But Shaman and Spriest are tempting... Is ele shaman burst combined with their mobility in ghost wolf good for world PvP? And are the mana issues of priest and shaman really that bad?
---
We will be levelling together once we hit 20ish most likely, we will be doing WPvP, and I know I’ll most likely go on more then the others, and going on in WPvP makes me feel a little anxious if I pick Warrior knowing I could get my ass kicked anywhere and anytime, 
---
I love the 1v1 aspect, just something about just one person vs another I like, so I like classes who are good at that, since they fit my play style, I love shaman, and very dislike Druid, maybe I’ll shaman and see how it works in the group
---
Retail is garbage
---
both dominate world pvp from phase 1 to 6.
---
both are bottom 2 dps, hunters will be higher in MC, similar in BWL, warlocks higher in Aq and naxx.
---
I too am concerned with the hunter bugs and leeway, if fixed i will play hunter, if not i will play warlock.
---
8.2 just added new content 
---
Doesn't help when the core of the game is shit
---
Illegal danish is the best WoW machinema behind MAGE and azerothian super villians
---
They are definitely final and chose their classes very fast, we would get together a lot of days, but a decent amount of time without eachother too, like 65% of the time will be spent together, but also doing WPvP and the 45% I’d be alone I’d feel screwed as an alone warrior
---
hydraxian is the least of the worries. You don't need all 7 douses immediately, you can literally just have a guy get ported back and forth. Anyway mages can aoe farm these mobs and get the rep within 5-6 hours, you can have any player tag along for that to get it too if you want more. And mages are some of the first to 60 in a dedicated guild, so they have plenty of time to aoe farm for a little bit.
---
The hard part is getting 40 people who actually level really fast, especially the healers, warriors and rogues.
---
You could still go for multiple gurubashi arena chests but many other things would already be fixed by this. Not a bad Idea.
---
Isn't diablo pay2play?
---
considering pathing is something even private servers could fix i doubt its gonna be a terribly issue for blizzard to fix.
---
Any rogue. Im dreadful at PVP so to get jumped and instantly die without seeing anything terrified me.
---
Any source on the fact that private servers are 50% easier? Because all the evidence I've seen suggests that it's the opposite.
---
&gt;he gets gear she wants because she's the only one who'll bed him
---
Come on, you couldn't step up and take one for the team?
---
The burst from shaman, may get you a quick easy kill if some worse geared people try to gank you, and ghost form may give you a possibility to get out of scenarios, but Rogue will definitely keep you the safest with stealth, you can really pick and choose when and who you fight.
---
Spriest are S tier for 1v1ing but if you’re getting yanked but a couple people it’s a lost cause because of the cloth. Mana issues can be bad but nothing you won’t understand and control quickly, you’ll learn very fast especially since it’s WPvP as well
---
Shaman would definitely be a decent choice. Like I said, with a good group, you can still tank most content and they're much better in almost all solo situations pre 60.
---
I don't think you can really compare it to a pen and paper rpg, altering your rolls is just a straight buff/nerf, there's no interactivity involved so fudging the stats can only have one outcome.
---
Being able to charge another warriors charge when you're low hp and kiting, predict blink &amp; gouge etc are all skill based interactions that can add depth to the gameplay. Of course there's also negatives like no last second grounding or interrupt.
---
Herbing on p-servers is often super broken - sometimes i'd wish it was the same in Classic.
---
I'm not assuming anything. I have played at release and the dynamic respawns were crazy!! 
---
Haven't watched his footage tbh I was just assuming that - but 5mins is still faster than classic and most private Servers without dynamic respawn.
---
Sooooo please shut up
---
You don't really seem to understand sharding properly, that is the mechanic that will allow people to massively abuse farm spots. With layering there's a set amount of nodes per population, with sharding you can artificially create more.
---
wow gamepedia and classic.wowhead have my version.
---
Agreeed bfa pvp is a joke Haha.
---
It would lower the amount of gurubashi chests aswell because you would "steal" them from diffrent layers and persons who are also there. 
---
So 1 guy with leveling friends around the world can get multiple now, but with my option he would still be able to get them. But his friends can't be just leveling somewhere and have to physicly help him out by being in the arena area aswell.
---
There is no perfect solution l, but this is the best I can come up with.
---
You know what dynamic means right? It means the spawns depend on how many players there is in the area.
---
And here i am 15 years later, a grown ass adult still cheering for the horde as if it was my football club. I agree with you
---
true, i am even calculating the succubus &amp; such which also deal ludicrous dps with it
---
rumor has it that imp scales 1:1 from firebolt but even if it where to go by normal design it would have about  0.571 scaling then.
---
With arcanite dragonling adding 60+ fire damage taken per debuff up to 300+ thats a good 150-160+ dps at the very least assuming its a modifier applied after all others, but if it works normally then it would be far far more all depending on how the modifier is added.
---
Herb over mining always.
---
Demand for ore will go down over time while demand for herbs will go up
---
That's not how they play out on private servers, minimum of 45mins but often it's a 2-4hr turtle. Same version of AV as Classic will have and these rush times are with naxx geared players.
---
its gonna happen regardlessly
---
Upfreshed
---
we rushed 1.5 AV hard mate the only thing that stopped the push were chinese turtle-mades.
---
it is as Beanna said, the version doesn't change this, it's player driven.
---
Guess I will be doing some more running then! I did kind of think that Horde had nicer place bases. Wasn't sure about flight paths.
---
Of course I can compare it to a pen and paper RPG.
---
Altering the distance you can hit from and be hit from is also a straight  buff/nerf. There's interactivity involved, I roll the dice. I choose what my character does, I choose if a roll even occurs at all.
---
Charging another warriors charge is not "skill based" its literally just spamming charge because you both leave combat at the same time and the batching window thinks you both pressed charge at the exact same moment.
---
Someone's got left by his wife and children.
---
Or got fired.
---
Just don't grab a rifle and go postal.
---
Stay on r/wowclassic and get downvoted.
---
It is a better alternative.
---
But contributing to ruining a servers economy is ok, other people don’t matter.. great logic you got there
---
Haha yes thats why I can't believe he had 5mins respawns all the way through xD The first 5 Levels alone he will have had crazy respawns - which I know is not a Major factor (first 5 Levels is not much) but he wasn't first all the way - so People were in the same zones he was (probably a lot of hunters early on) which will probably have affected the respawn times too :P
---
I can watch the Video l8r and watch the respawns. If you are right I will come  and comment again.
---
If I was right you can be sure I will be commenting again xD
---
Not saying he wouldn't have been first without dynamic respawns - just mentioning that it did Play a role and it is not comparable to real Servers :) &lt;3
---
That actually sounds like a reallly goood idea lol
---
 Can't say how early raiding will be but when it comes to leveling a warlock is nuts. 2/2 Imp drain soul and you just never stop going. But that is probably an unnecessary comment since you probably know that already.
---
 As for raiding as a warlock and dps. You are not going to be brought in for your dps so shouldn't matter I would think. All that would matter would be your dps compared to other warlocks in the raid( taking spec into account of course). 
---
 For the reasons you mentioned regarding hunter I would be hesitant as well. I would just keep track of what is happening in the beta and see if they fix things. Also could be that if the issues are not fixed it actually could be a good thing in a sense. Less hardcore people rolling hunter so more of a chance to get a raid spot in a good guild at 60.
---
In the first stress test you could open them at any level. Not sure if anything changed.
---
Yes definitely. Twinking is a fun side-project, and the upside of being able to turn off xp is it invigorates the meta at lower levels. There'll be more dungeon groups forming to farm gear at each bracket, market demand for BOE goods needed for twinking will increase which benefits people farming mount gold, and BG queues shorten. 
---
And since twinking won't disappear because there is no option to turn off xp, why not implement it? Just to spite people who make twinks? 
---
Also the effect on non-twink lowbies is overestimated. Out in the world you'll get killed by higher levels anyway.
---
This is hoe blizzard handles it. They dont ban them roght away because if they are too effective gold seller will die out which is bad for blizzard because of money. So they let them be just long enough that the goldfarmers can justify buying new accaunts and pay for subs again in an infinite cycle.
---
Thats also something that by default shouldnt be possible to do, although its fun and adds positive gameplay mechanics and possibilities.
---
There is a talent you can spec for a 90% chance to stay in stealth after a sap and not enter combat, which is exactly inteded to do these kind of things. It was intended that not every rogue with every spec should even be able to have a strong reliable and safe cc without sacrificing something for it in the form of talent points &amp; dps, which is good game design. (see how Pantheon are designing their thief class, they do get a lot of cc possibilities, but will have to sacrifice quite some dps to maintain cc's because it costs them a lot of energy)
---
If you're able to bypass this restriction by abusing a flawed/exploitable mechanic, spec into full dps and still be able to cc just as good as a rogue who literally specced into the "cc/utility" tree, then it crosses some borders between "clever &amp; fun use of mechanics" and "harmful exploits".
---
By the holy light.....
---
You have to be very special to assume bug fixes will turn the game into BfA. I don't give a shit if they fix some of the really broke unintended stuff or not but you should try and form your own opinion instead of parroting everything you hear on YouTube and twitch.
---
Nit true because with enough gold you can buy carries for anything so no, you dont have to be a good player
---
Wow gamepedia also says this
---
&gt; 📷 [\[Shield Block\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shield_Block)  normally lasts 5 seconds, or 1 hit (whichever comes first).  Improved  Shield Block extends this to 6 seconds or 2 hits (whichever comes  first).  There is only one rank of this talent.
---
There is only one rank? Clearly that's not right. Classic wowhead does say as you say it, however, and i've also found evidence of people saying it only gives one extra block on [battle.net](https://battle.net) forums. So given this evidence, we'll assume that the source i got it from (fandom wiki) is incorrect, making you the victor in this debate.  It's interesting though that there's so many conflicting sources of information, and stuff that's plainly wrong like the above quote. It also makes me question the patch note that i quoted. Who'd have thought one talent could be so convoluted in the way that it behaves.
---
No?
---
Don't you understand? If they fix wall jumping in BG's then they HAVE to add flying and lfr!
---
I want to play my sisters clit, but she wont let me.
---
None going OG Classic
---
Is there any math to what value you gonna get at certain item levels? For example the Pathfinder hat of the monkey is lvl 29 twink item. But the stats vary between 9/9, 8/8. Like how can you know if your item has the higher end or the lower end of the stats.
---
I dont remember if there were level requirements based on zones, but I do remember Blizzard at one point doing something to combat the increasing number of bots using speed hacks to fly around zones and loot all the chests to sell the rare items and then in-turn sell the gold.
---
I just can't remember if that was a level requirement or not... anyone know?
---
Btw, dude, I apologize about my bad behaviour. Was a ill-advised trolling attempt, probably a reaction to being told I was clueless about what I was talking about.
---
With two accounts or? You couldn’t have both factions on a pvp realm.
---
I'm not sure about the beta, sorry. But in Vanilla, you could loot chests at any level.
---
Unlike WoW, 90% of gil's uses are housing, vanity or crafting related.
---
Furthermore, it's super easy to make gil in the game, even without crafting. The majority of gil being passed around is on the market board, so unless you're really needing an expensive piece of glamour or the latest minions, you probably won't need a lot of it to effectively play that game.
---
Lets talk about moonwalk now
---
I hate to break it to you but most of them aren't going to want to play this or have the time to if they have normal lives
---
&gt; it's not like it can't be saved. 
---
Well, that is delusion 101. Sure, in theory, anything can be saved. Retail WoW is beyond that point. It is like trying to revive a 10 years dead corpse. It is possible (if Jesus is coming back) but highly improbable. 
---
To save retail, you need like 3 expansions, because the changes have to come SLOW, in order to SLOWLY change the player base.
---
Think about Vanilla to MoP. It took 3 expansions of changes to change the player base in order to go Microtransactions, easy content, accessibility, etc.
---
Do you THINK that retail have enough LIFE in it for 3 more expansions???
---
Because I think that 9.0 will be the LAST expansion of retail on PC, and 10.0 will be mobile only. And that is because of Classic.
---
If it weren't for Classic, I would agree with you : Retail can be saved.
---
But...well, with Classic being a SOLID (and much better) option, I don't see Retail going past 9.0.
---
And the moment Blizzard is announcing TBC and Classic+...it's over for Retail.
---
And they WILL announce both TBC and Classic+.
---
What professions do I go on Druid?
---
Skinning LW? Seems fun, RP appropriate. Not a lot of money in it sadly.
---
Herb/Alchemy? Goes well with druid forms, makes decent money.
---
Mining/Engineering? Most performance boost. Seems expensive and not very RP appropriate for a druid, feels wrong. 
---
Enchanting at some point to get smoking heart of the mountain?
---
Do you remember if you tried opening chests in some higher lvl zones? The drop rate might be tied to the lvl of the chest.
---
Another great quality of the Undead - impeccable taste!
---
What? What you said makes zero sense.
---
This muthafucka on helium?
---
At that point I just delete my character and start anew.
---
I wouldn't recommend WoW for PvP at all. It sucks in retail and Classic. The only difference is it's fun to play in Classic.
---
The fact that everyone says herbalism kind of makes me want to go mining due to supply and demand...
---
Trolls laughing, ice on the cake.
---
I'd love this (and Elywnn forest) without the Warcraft logo.
---
Either way, nice job.
---
Not unless we get our EU servers.
---
Edgelord undead rogues/priests. however my gnome warrior stood his ground pretty good. Still got a few nice screens from those days with a mortal strike crit sending undeads back home.
---
Thanks for the response but my brother will be rolling Horde as well, we live in different countries and used to play together so unfortunately aiming for Alliance toons isn't possible. Wish you luck for when Classic hits!
---
Naw it’s my voice
---
Most of the chests I've looted were in the 30-40 zones.
---
I hated that they from TBC and foward instancd new zones that was added to the existing kalimdor/eastern kingdoms (i hav eno problems with new continents).
---
Thanks, that gives me some confidence to give my plan a shot at least.
---
Power-leveling the shit out of it. (Just kidding, I'm going slow this time) Imagine how many times we re-rolled on different servers because of F R E S H. Hell, I think I would manage to level my toon even in a coma.
---
Well, at least there's no lvl restrictions so far. Thanks!
---
This guy gets it.
---
OP name should be “OutcomeofFailingCum”
---
POGGINDACHATUH!
---
That is my own opinion. I don’t mean literally BfA, but something similar. BfA didn’t happen in one year either. It is the result of a long chain of stupid decisions that made the game what it is. Let’s not start that process again by removing fun harmless things from the game.
---
Just did the chain, no issues.   Got myself a bit of a ring upgrade from the last reward.
---
If you're going to focus on pvp I would urge you to pick whatever you feel like. 
---
But if you're going to play 5-man dungeons I would definitely go for warrior to complement the group. It is true as you say that warriors aren't that good on their own, however, having a 5 man group consisting of irl pals for dungeons throughout the game will be an absolute blast. It will be such a great experience for all of you to experience all over f the classic 5-man pve experience together to at least consider playing warrior.
---
And well, in pvp its insanely fun to play warrior if you have a shaman healer with wf up, its just the soloing that isn't as great as most other classes.
---
I think you might struggle to farm lion heart helm and epic mount off of only herb or mining either way. You'll need to do other things for the majority of your money towards those goals because of how much you'll need. I'm certain that the best herb spots will be camped and probably same goes for mining, except you can load into instances for mining spots that won't be camped. I'm going mining and saving up all my resources for engineering! Doesn't really answer your question tho :)
---
Yeahhhh i'm not so thrilled about finding out that i'm wrong about this. It's pretty natural, and in a lot of cases i respond the same way. I'd say it's safe to say you're right, i just don't understand what those 1.6 patch notes are supposed to mean then. Rank 2/3 gave no extra block at all i guess? 
---
The way i understood is that (excluding parry hasting) the 2.0 base attack speed of 90% of bosses that aren't dual wielding or some similar mechanic would mean that you'd block twice and the boss would be halfway to his next attack when shield block came back up.  Meaning that one point was only ever really necessary. It would make sense if it gave an extra charge for each rank but it seems that just not how it works. Would be nice to have someone on the beta clarify this though, even though i feel your interpretation is correct
---
I am playing on a WOTLK server right now and the dungeons are so fucking bad. They take 10 mins and it is literally just a corridor that you autopilot on with no challenge.
---
Vanilla dungeons are so much better it's crazy.
---
Because the infinite amount of things you can do are usually optional. Most of the time consuming shit in Classic IS the game.
---
I pop healing pots and swiftness pots like candy. On every toon I make I always keybind both of these potions and pretend they are just another ability I have. I go through a lot.
---
This was the single best quest in the game. Nothing to date has compared. I remember seeing other hunters with it and thinking how amazingly strong they must be.
---
Professional casuals aren't going to be playing classic. The end game of classic if there is nothing new after naxx will be a bunch of no lifes just like it is on pservers.
---
Dariusvii.
---
I thought the VII would capitalize like it did in Lineage 2, it didn't. I cared not and leveled him to 60. I then made an Alliance paladin with the same name and leveled him to 60.
---
Druid would be a better leveling experience for when you aren’t with them I would think, but if you think at 60 you will want warrior then go for that. The shaman could theoretically tank dungeons as enhance (which is what they should level as anyway) if you guys are all good and you played a priest, so that’s also an option.
---
This is photoshopped, I can tell by the pixels.
---
Also chests don't spawn in the same location every time like they do on private servers. They all seem to have about 4 locations they can spawn in of which private servers seem to consistently only have 1 where it spawns every time.
---
I want to play ele-resto standard PvP shaman but all my friends are likely going alliance as we always do. Anything else that comes close on alliance side except for disc/holy priest?
---
 I am rolling a warrior as well and not sure about professions either. On an old server I would go mining +skinning, save all the mining materials and drop one of them at 60 for engineering. Other option is to go herbalism instead of mining and get gold from selling herbs and buy the bars you need to level up engineering. 
---
 Here is the thing though, on a fresh server it's going to be hellish to level up a gathering professions unless the layering mechanic they have is used to create tons of layers. Going to be so many players. 
---
 On a private server launch I played I went skinning +herbalism on a human warrior. When I had outleveled Elwynn Forest my herbalism was lagging behind a lot. Had to resort to camping nodes, logging in back and forth, as well as doing herb runs for a couple of hours.
---
 Classic launch shouldn't be as bad as that but I would guess it's going to be bad still. 
---
 Can add as well that the good thing with mining is smelting. Could always resort to buying ore from the AH and smelt to skill up. Hopefully once you get past the starting zones it will be easier to level up.
---
Take my sweet ass time leveling and enjoying literally every single minute of the experience.
---
I don't care how many people hit 60 before me, a veteran Holy Paladin will find a raid spot. Rushing 50% of the games content seems like a really boring thing to do.
---
It's definitely comparable. Is it exactly the same? Obviously not. But it's a pretty decent indicator of how incredibly fast a mage has the potential to level if everything goes perfect like it did for him.
---
I had a nelf hunter called "Silhouette" and a human paladin called "Flik".
---
Those are situational things that don't make or break the encounter. They are the one time only situations where WoTF shines but trolls have abilities that work better in more situations than one. In general those abilities are stronger and more often used than ''cooldowns'' which UD has.
---
Berserking is cd that you can use offensively or defensively in raids and in pvp at any point. WoTF only works when you lose control and how many times it's that in pvp and raid? Not many in either but unless you make a toon that is specialized against warlock duels I don't see much of a reason why you would value UD over troll.
---
I don't mean either race is terrible but if there are two options then usually one is better than the other at something. The biggest question is which do you value more: more usefulness in generic use or situational specific benefit.
---

Anyone can be alchemist, it requires almost nothing. Making flasks will be done in guilds and you just trade the mats to your guild crafter and he will get you the flask you need. So essentially there's really low profit margins actually trying to make money as alchemy.
---
I can give you an enhanced version via ESRGAN but the file size is 35mb and I can't seem to find a image hosting that allow. Not sure if I can link an mediafire or like link here.

Hi, /u/MegaSuperKID

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5o7oy/best_race_for_warlock/). 
---
Those people probably aren't looking for honor if they're Naxx geared though are they? They're looking to dick about and one shot some fools. Come Classic when people want both rep and honor, I'd say rushes are more likely. Time will tell though
---
Yeah but late millennials started with wotlk and BC and parrot on about it being the best
---
This one.
---
I might also play warlock come classic if they fix layering, i should have you as a source of information. I do recognize your name aswell and wonder if we played on the same pserver.
---
Heya all!
---
I've pretty much decided that I'm going to play warlock in Classic (ask me again in a week). This is mostly because warlock is the only class I got no experience in wow. I'm going to roll Horde for a first time because I've never experienced Horde either and my IRL friends want to roll there, so Lok'tar Ogar kek.
---
Only thing I'm undecided about is the race. Cosmetically I prefer the female models for caster on both Orc and Undead and I like them both so there is no significal cosmetical preferences.
---
I've read guides and forums about warlocks but I really don't know which one race is better per se for warlock. WotF is surely good against priests and other wlocks and stun resist is just Amazing against Rogues in particular. But what classes are harder match-ups for warlock? Pet dmg doesn't really count in at lvl 60 am I rite?
---
Tl;dr: is Orc or Undead better race for Warlock?
---
Nah I'm a trustfund kid and I will have a huge wealth by 30 in 5 years and I actually started to actively work on my body, tastes and currently teaching theater to college students. I'm far from average, the thing is I'm far too behind from my peers in highschool and college, thats all that matters. I wasted my potential to be much more.
---
as in most warriors either use swords, axes, maces because of weapon specialization or racials, sry if that wasnt clear in my comment.
---
Basically everything in AV favours Alliance, tower designs, base designs, graveyard locations and surroundings, almost all of it is heavily biased towards an Alliance win.
---
Except for the transmutes... Which like said above, will be useful for almost the entire game.
---
Also by your logic, anyone can be *insert any profession*. So are all professions useless since you can just move mats around in your guild and get other people to make stuff?
---
Imo go mining and use it to farm DME 2boss once DM is out, best consistent money maker for a warrior and mining does have pretty decent synergy with you already trying to get lionheart mats and leveling engi.
---
How layers being more populated will change the fact you'll jump into a new one when joining a group from an other layer ? 
---
I mean maybe I get the thing wrong, but to me literally the opposite of what you describe will happen at launch ; there will indeed be more players, hence each layer is going to be more populated than on Beta (say 1k players/layer), which also means ***it will be easier to jump from one layer to an other***, as one layer having 1010 players and the other having 990 players is close to no difference between them percentage wise, whereas on Beta a 60-40 distribution between layers is a way bigger disparity.
---
That's a reckonin'.
---
&gt; The way i understood is that (excluding parry hasting) the 2.0 base attack speed of 90% of bosses that aren't dual wielding or some similar mechanic would mean that you'd block twice and the boss would be halfway to his next attack when shield block came back up.
---
Exactly, meaning that excluding parries you'd be pretty safe from crushing.
---
Normies will still buy FaPs, health / mana pots, and water breathing pots like candy.
---
If you can draw on the map it will take approximately 0.014 AV matches for people to draw penises.
---
I'm consider any gnome that is not dead a bug that needs to be squished.
---
What a horrible comparison lol
---
For PvP orc is a lot better. You harder matchups rely on stunning you and overall there are a lot of stuns that are nice to resist like warrior intercept etc. For PvE you can go for whatever you like.
---
Only in your opinion
---
Right making 3-5 gold a day is a useful profession..
---
And well yes most crafting professions aren't useful. Have one of each in the guild and that's all you need. And alchemy is especially bad since it's really cheap and easy to level compared to other professions since there will be countless of people leveling herbalism for the amazing gold it gives and most of the lowlvl herbs have no use other than skilling alch.
---
Naxx geared Shockadin. But thats not very realistic so no not really.
---
SG scales very well with shadow damage unlike dots. That 350 total becomes 350 for each individual charge very easily.
---
There's no point talking one or two specific match ups and compare two races. You should do all classes and compare which race benefits more from racials abdicate but just the few that are beneficial to support your view. As I've said multiple times: it's all about the circumstances and situation but troll has lots of abilities that are flexible abdicate not locked to one specific situation. It's a comparison where you weight which situations you encounter more and thus which becomes more beneficial for you.
---
That is very true. It is a good indicator - especially if layering is abusable I'm 100% certain Mage will be first to hit 60.
---
It's weird considering every single person other than you says Alchemy is a top-tier profession and that ALL professions in Classic are useful in one way or another.
---
Very interesting viewpoint you've got. Goodluck I suppose!
---
I don't get it.
---
Greek here. 90% of it all was probably "malaka".
---
The reason why it doesn't work in Classic is because it's on a newer engine. Different from both vanilla emulators and original Wow.
---
pserver habits will undoubtly move over to classic, so 'reserve' crap will definitely be a thing (unfortunately).
---
Good part is that servers have less players and no cross-realm, so once you're known as the 'reserve' guy, people will be far less inclined to be grouping with you.
---
Loot it and boot it. Ezclap vanish

 I want to roll a Warrior to play with my friends who are rolling (Shaman, Druid, Hunter, Lock) so we have a tank in the group, but the issue is I'm not sure how often we will be able to play together. On the other hand, I really enjoy Shamans so I am thinking this will be my solo alt. I really enjoy playing warrior but don't want the treachery of solo leveling a warrior. As of now I'm thinking of leveling both these chars at once, but I'm not sure which one will end up getting more playing time and be my "main". Is it realistic to level two characters at once? Or should I just decide which one  I enjoy more and focus on just getting him to 60?
---
I'm pretty sure FFXIV passed WoW's peak already
---
Of course I understand that certain player types enjoy PVP as it is meant to be. And this is why I rolled PVP servers in the past (Vanilla and private servers since 2011).
---
If a player experiences a rush after a PVP victory, why shouldn't others have their rush too? I get a rush, when I complete a tier set. But then people decide that I cannot enter Blackrock because they again want their rush and put it above my needs as a player. So I am forced to play the game their way and that is just not fun. On top of that I do pay a subscription fee just to corpse run or log into an alt.
---
My criticism is that PVP in WoW is not waterproof, it is less punishing, but still not perfect. My only hope for PVP realms this time is that there are less toxic PVPers, because they do not want to pay the sub. Maybe I'll still try a PVP realm, but the last 15 years have made me bitter.
---
Pickpocket loot tables are wildly off on  pservers I wouldn't use this for comparison. Rogue diaries for example drop significantly less and sell for around 2 silver. Some servers have this up at 45 silver
---
LOL, wouldn't say it's accurate, but it's still pretty funny.
---
I remember being a SL lock with improved imp and absolutely wrecking, but I remember it getting nerfed hard because too many people complained. I also remember it getting changed pretty quick, so I think it was bugged. I specifically remember thinking that it was insanely overpowered
---
Correct me if i'm wrong; bandwidth may have changed since 2005 but ping and responsiveness has not changed much.
---
So why should this mechanic be different to how it was?
---
Sometimes you see like 20 tin nodes in the mine in westfall on pservers. That is definitely not a thing in Classic.
---
Minty - night elf druid. Bungler - gnome mage. I'm not using either of these this time around!
---
&gt; The bars sells for around 30g\~ each I would estimate, or you can sell the trasmute for half. 
---
15 gold for a transmute seems way to much. On a new private server I played the transmutes a couple of months in sold for around 5-6 gold.
---
And majority of this sub opinion
---
Yeah it was a slog, but you realize your teammates consisted of a tryhard streamer with tryhard friends queued up with BiS and max engineering
---
I do find it funny to see that guy’s time being wasted.
---
Its fun! and people crying "retail is shit" just makes it more fun! I like seeing people desperately trying to shove their opinions down other peoples throats!
---
I am having fun and Im getting my moneys worth.
---
Yes, because that won't impact your Role Play interactions with *me.*
---
Which isn't everyone
---
Classic = Vanilla thru the first half of WotLK for me.  Classic ends and modern WoW begins with the T9 patch that introduced the Random Dungeon Finder queue.
---
Alimdo is my favorite continent in wow
---
This sub doesn't know much about how classic is played in 2019
---
The vanilla pservers I played on all had this problem. A silithus cave in shimmering flats had like 10 mithril nodes in it and around.
---
If you sub right now you can try to log into retail. If retail runs fine, Classic will be no problem at all.
---
I'm sure blizz are still figuring out where specific thresholds are suppose to be.  Honestly I would personally prefer that mechanics like leeway be emulated to the best of the game's ability so hopefully these sorts of kinks can be ironed out a bit.
---
Other than those minor adjustments I don't take too much of an issue with it.  It'l just be another quirk for players to work with.  There is a specific charm that classic has over a lot of other games, and it's hard to tell if stuff like leeway contribute to that feel.
---
I appreciate your long reply to this topic. I think its important not to be biased to private servers and acknowledge that all these things aren't going to be the same in Classic. As of the MC thing, we don't know. It's so frustrating to see people comment on stuff with such certainty, when we haven't seen it in beta. There might be more bombs than the 14% parry.    
---
Your main criticism is "they wont be out until phase X".    
---
You are missing a big point of being a gold goblin in WoW. Literally all a goblin thinks about is earning maximum from every single move. Half of his guide is thinking ahead. Why is this a problem? Its not a classic launch guide, or phase 1 guide. Half of the big bucks are hoarding certain items for specific times. Sure, some of his points might be miss and risk, considering we don't know the meta.   
---
for everyone. It's really fun to discover ways to make gold as a goblin. And as a fact, I can already say on top of my head 2-3 things he misses out on in this long guide, that has made me loads of gold on p-servers and back in vanilla. So don't think this is all. Find your own business, and own it!
---
Fortunately I never have to grind for an exotic pet... My CE panda is always there \^\^
---
There's  something ironic goin' on here.
---
FRESH never dies!
---
He died in felwood or darkshore and have to run from splintertree post graveyard in ashenvale.
---
The mage getting a sub 3 day played to 60 probably abused dynamic respawn to aoe grind.
---
But he could probably abuse layering the same way if it stay so he might get a similar record i guess.
---
I don't think a gathering profession are a good gold-maker early on.
---
The reason for that is the following:
---
The only sources of gold-income from the game itself, not other players, are quests and vendoring.
---
Unless people have their epic-mounts the demand for gold will be higher than the demand for profession-materials.
---
If you can level those things without having to go out of your way to do so, then do it. But when it becomes a significant time-investment you might be better of just killing mobs and vendoring their greys.
---
You might want to pick up skinning, which I assume you'll be doing anyways besides one of the other two. But don't expect much profit. Early on you'll barely be able to sell for more than the vendor-price.
---
Once people have their epic-mounts they'll start valuing gold less compared to other things. So if you want to go the gathering route, it might be a good idea to hoard that stuff and sell it later.
---
The road to 60 is long and takes a lot of hardcore grinding by today’s standards. I don’t think two characters are really feasible unless you’re that sure you are going to nolife this. I would pick warrior for your friends because your clique needs one. Plus no loot competition with friends right?
---
you are thinking about early TBC and yes early TBC it was rediculous as a result blizzard nerfed the book etc.
---
grenades
---
PvP wise id say Orc would be better race, for that stun resist is nice to the classes that can counter you.
---
Levelling it may be a bit easier on an undead because of cannibalize.
---
PvE doesn’t matter too much, but for everything other than PvP I’d choose Undead purely because they have the best casting animations
---
Rule of thumb is using the lowest or second lowest rank of your healing spell that has the full cast time.
---
So the first few ranks of most healing abilities are faster than the others. Cast time is the main factor in scaling, which is what you are using when you down rank. A way lower cost heal with the same scaling but less base healing. This is usually rank4-5 of your main heal.
---
Yeah, they will have to hop layer to abuse aoe grinding, just slightly more difficult.
---
If "a long time" means never, then yeah.
---
Holy sh** great!
---
I can't stress enough how valuable a CC breaker is tbh, surprisingly in pve more so than pvp in this case.
---
There's a reason dwarf priest is considered the best racial , fear ward being so valuable in raids, why would you not think it's the same case for WotF ? 10 secs of running around in fear is marginally less hps/dps than 10-30% faster casting for a very small duration, in my opinion at least , but each has their merits.
---
I think it's pretty obvious what was meant by interactivity when comparing a turn based game and a real time game. 
---
Batching adds unique interactions/predictive plays that aren't possible without it, while yes it also lowers skill in other areas which I already mentioned in my comment. Personally I don't care if it's in or not, but I don't think you can group it with leeway which is a much more straight forward mechanic
---
Is ironforge the hub in classic? Idk how flight points work in 1.12.  It's the closest major city to bwl/mc for and the boat to get to ony. I think
---
Is this officially unofficial or unofficially official?
---
well i played on about 70% of the 1.12.1 servers that came and went through the times. often went lock but sadly for pservs pet mechanics are too much of a handfull so i often went warrior, priest, shaman or similar. ^^
---
I’m having a hard time choosing a class to play Classic. I’ve just started playing WoW (1 month), but I’m not new to MMORPGs at all. 
---
Now I’m torn between Paladin, Hunter and Mage. Considering my lack of experience with the game plus the fact that classic is much different than retail, what can I do? I want to PvP and PvE.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Refer to this.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Class#Class_roles
---
According to this, a druid with the appropriate talents can be almost as good at healing as a priest can. Is that true? If so, why does one choose to be a priest instead of a druid, and why is to join a group as a priest easier than as a druid? This question especially applies to PvP, because a druid can escape with travel form, unlike a priest. A priest is too slow.
---
Tauren is the best race for herbalism because of its racial trait Cultivation. A class which can wear leather is the best for herbalism, because the item Herbalist's Gloves is leather. Is a tauren druid the best combination for herbalism? I think so, because a druid is the fastest class because of aquatic form and travel form. Aquatic form is useful for gathering herbs in water.
---
Yup, I think this is what I’ll most likely do.
---
"OMG BLizzard finally doing what the players asked"
---
it doesnt matter, anything goes, different options have different pro's.
---
a mage will have great cc, aoe capability and conjured food/drinks.
---
a warlock will have sustained damage through life tap, good cc, an extra tank pet. hunter has the same pro's.
---
a shaman or paladin will have utility/buffs and the likes.
---
a rogue will add greatly to your dps.
---
etc
---
All healing spells, including Renew, are scaled so that lower ranks offer better heal *per mana*, but higher ranks offer (obviously) better heals overall, i.e. heal *per second*.
---
The difference between e.g. rank 4 and 5 is small, but the difference between rank 1 and 5 is several percent. So using lower ranks when possible is more mana-efficient.
---
Out of your heals, Flash Heal and Greater Heal are the most powerful, but Heal is the most mana-efficient, and it scales well with +healing because of the 3 sec cast time. The difference in heal per mana between FH/GH and Heal is considerable, so at level 60 a mana-conservative way to heal is to spam lower ranks of Heal.
---
Hunter would be good for you,mages are also good both pvp and pve,but pve is just spamming frostbolt.
---
Thanks for giving this dude a reality check
---
Exactly! Both opinions do not matter.
---
Also remember that chests do not despawn until all items are taken. So some could have been looted previously.
---
I will still agree that the drop rate of valuable items is likely much less than private servers.
---
I do, however, vaguely remember getting greens pretty commonly around 40+
---
&gt; I was simply pointing out that there are other options for streamers that don't want to get griefed all day.
---
Yes, such quality options as "don't make money" or "just tell people you play on your alt and that will make them not grief you".
---
There is no difference really, the formula is the same, he just changed the values.
---
You choose to see it differently though.
---
You're obviously not a threat.
---
Oh my god literally unplayable, lets throw sarcastic comments blizzards way because their beta has bugs. Yeh that makes soo much sense!
---
hahaha, 3 deaths and a repair bill. Dumbass rogue.
---
Hey guys. I know I wanna play a clothie but I’m kinda torn. 
---
I heal on live, but even on live I know holy is pretty dull. Looking at classic healing it really just looks too dull, only casting one or two heals, and as a more general worry I worry that the complexity of live is gonna leave the combat feeling dull.
---
This is why I’m rethinking mage too, as it’s a literally one button spec then a two button spec later on. 
---
As for warlock, limited debuff slots limiting how much of your class you can play worry’s me about getting frustrated.
---
Can y’all who played classic educate me on how the simplification of rotations and roles won’t be mind numbing?
---
Why would turn based vs real time make a difference when the mechanics you're talking about changing have literally nothing to do with either. Leeway is a straight increase to range if both targets are moving, batching is a straight window of 200ms that allows you to do things you shouldn't be able to do. It is absolutely no different at all to arbitrarily allowing a turn based character more range, or arbitrarily allowing a turn based character the ability to cast a spell when they shouldn't. 
---
It lowers skill requirement in **all** areas, not "some" it doesn't add "predictions" or anything like that. It literally does the opposite, it allows you to react **after** something has already happened.
---
Level with skinning and herbalism. You’ll have to work on herb as you won’t find enough to keep leveling naturally like skinning. Find an alchemy guide and just have a list of all necessary herbs. Vender all skinning and extra herbs if low on cash. It’s faster to just level herb/alch at max tho but you do you boo.
---
Man i recon you should give druid a good. Great solo and WPvP and can tank dungeons no problems
---
Well, this entire thread is arguably against rule #1 and rule #7.
---
That is a marital compromise, bruh.
---
Tried to talk about this once. A big part of players were against fixing this. Probably because they are gonna use it as hell to farm gold in DM.
---
They prefer let this in place and ruin the economy than having a change/fix. Well...
---
I enjoyed running on the edge of stv down to blasted lands. Or climbing the world tree up to the top. 
---
Around Stormwind was also nice.
---
Agreed
---
I mean... it's not an issue anymore.. since.. you know.. Sylvannas made the place a biohazard zone..
---
What a horrible response.
---
Tidal charm
---
I dont. At least not in the initial crush.
---
None of this will matter come launch
---
Blackpirate... I don't know how I came up with this name other than thinking of The Princess Bride and Dread Pirate Roberts and maybe Dreadpirate was taken. Everyone ended up just calling me BP. Even more funny was that it started out as a female gnome rogue. Still have the rogue on my account even though it's a goblin named Sliktrix now. Carried that damn rogue all the way up to AQ 20 in vanilla and have raided on and off with it ever since.
---
Nah that's a normal pally he's describing whittling someone, a shockadin would actually instantly burst you down lol, especially with the AQ trinket.
---
&gt; FFXIV 
---
https://ffxivcensus.com/
---
There are less created characters than WoW purchases.
---
There was never a level requirement for Chests.
---
Friend, you can't decide who you love. I mean she decided to allow his friend to fall in love and to seduce her. She decided all alone to continue this relationship instead of telling him stop. 
---
My girlfriend had this kind of friend who loved her but she went full stop with them. She decided to stop it because she was not interested. 
---
Saying it is the fault of the man is as absurd as wanting to break the nose of the guy who slept with your cheating girlfriend. The problem here is that the girlfriend decided to cheat not the man.
---
Cheating women are as responsible for cheating as cheating man. They are capable of her own thoughts and actions really.
---
&gt;They're players. They play.
---
And they have the pay for the priviledge! Thats some next gen business sense right there from Activision!
---
Horrible latency? Do you live in a 3rd world country? I had around 20 ms in Sweden back in vanilla.
---
Shout out to Furä, GM of &lt;Curse&gt; and apparently an old lovable mom with impeccable music taste.
---
Not at all. The Joana Record was on a PvE Server with Rested XP.
---
Wow, people weren't kidding when they say the game hands you everything on a plate were they.....
---
Seems like it since after an update all skellies are gone, otherwise I haven't noticed any dissapear.
---
the actual answer is in a convo thats about the development process of warlock back in vanilla, why they did stuff, there was a question about improved firebolt in it
---
Well, when League wasn't a thing Wow was more famous. That may (I hope not) happen.
---
it depends if there is a good raidleader who is able to rally the troops or not
---
Azerite, titanforge and all that was just a huge put off for me. Just the way it was designed was more like Mobile game mechanics and less like an RPG.
---
Is this the same for warlock pets?
---
&gt;Is a tauren druid the best combination for herbalism?
---
The racial trait Cultivation has almost zero impact on the game, all it does is put you 15 skill levels higher in Herbalism which takes like.. 10 minutes to fix in Durotar/Mulgore? It really doesn't do a lot for you man, think about it. Also, if you're planning on playing druid you have no other choice than to play Tauren so idk why you're asking if Tauren Druid is the way to go.
---
You cant control what you roll on a dice, but you can force an enemy CD by timing your CC with theirs. For example blinding warrior fear or blinding intercept.
---
Of course you alliance players need a safe space don't you
---
Yeah, 8.2 seems quite good. Only time will tell tho. The entirety of BFA was over hyped and failed to deliver.
---
I mean, 5-6 gold at all is better than not having it.
---
It's been 15 years, so I can't recall how much the arcanite CD went for, but I remember paying a bit for it so I could make my Reaper. Regardless, professions are all useful, and in the end the only thing that matters is how much fun you're having with your chosen professions. So do what you want, and if it doesn't work for you, you can switch! EASY!
---
Sad, 90% of my gametime was in IF jumping on the straight wall
---
I never cared about that when I played. ./who and or send someone back to capital.
---
I see alot of people throwing the term "ruin the economy" around.
---
How do you mean that farming gold in dm will ruin the economy?
---
it will work if you have alts with gathering professions
---
Lol I’m just having some fun
---
I only lasted 20 seconds into that and had to switch it off
---
Hilarious, but ... couldn’t stop cringing
---
It's been a long time but I'm fairly sure priests had no chance if I was using my spellstone. Dispelling all dots instantly + future dots with felhunter, draining their mana and then when they'd hardcast something shadow spelllock them.
---
As a warlock most people would leave me alone. I did start to distrust druids as they become quite strong in later levels with their hybrid spec. By far the majority of them are pretty clueless about PvP and don't want to fight, so you build this kind of trust with them. When you see a druid in STV grinding the same trolls or panthers as you do, generally you can cooperate. But then, once in a blue moon, comes a druid who knows his shit and then you have a real fight on your hands. Not only because druids are quite strong, but also because you naturally believed he was peaceful. It's this shock of suddenly going all hands on deck because the least likely class to gank you, is ganking you, that makes them dangerous.
---
Preventing fear is important for tank so it would not fk up threat and lead bosses wander and snap out damage dealers. Yet not all tanks are UD because there are ways for them to prevent that. It's not catastrophical for dd/healers as long as not everyone is wandering. As I mentioned troll works the best if most others are UD. You're better at different encounters than they are and no one is best at everything (except arguably warrior). That's the beauty of vanilla.
---
But like someone mentioned it's better that not everyone knows how good troll really can be. It's fugly for most so they ignore the race and go for UD because they've heard it's best. It is best at something but certainly not at everything and like I've mentioned I find troll priests especially a lot better in general use for both healing and dd/pvp as spriest.
---
It’s due to the quality and/or the p-server owners trying to force 1x leveling rates on an expansion server.
---
guide is pooop
---
If you decide to play Paladin you have to play Alliance and will be forced to play as the 'healer' role in both 5 mans and raids simply because paladin dps and tanking sucks in PvE in classic. Hunter is easy for leveling and has huge gold making potential if you know how to solo DM:N tribute runs etc. Mage is literally only pressing frostbolt in raids and can become quite dull/boring to play imo.
---
I know I know :)
---
It doesnt matter how many you loot if the loot table is off
---
it's way too much. hunters are gonna hVe a bad time being kited in their dead zone..
---
This will probably get fixed.
---
Even if it doesn't it's a reportable exploit and on live there will be penalties for shit like this.
---
Dumb meme go to private servers or if thats not close enough you're just a nitpicker
---
Disclaimer: this was meant purely  as a joke.
---
You can control what you roll on a dice if you arbitrarily decide what the roll is. Like I said if I say "hey if I roll anything from a 10 upwards, it counts as a 20." Guess what I've just done? I've controlled the chabces ill roll something decent. The same applies if I say hey I know my initiative is lower, but I cast a spell at the same time as him for no reason. 
---
If you want to say it's still not total control, well neither is when your enemy casts, if youre in range, if you get controlled by someone else etc etc.
---
The fact remains here is you haven't actually blinded a warrior fear, or intercept. One of you did it first, and the server is rewarding the one who didn't do it first.
---
"Humor"
---
&gt; Why would turn based vs real time make a difference when the mechanics you're talking about changing have literally nothing to do with either.
---
In a turn based game you can't see someone starting casting warstomp, time your gouge so it goes off at the same time letting you safely sit the stun and wasting the cd etc. Instead you'd gouge, warstomp wouldn't go off, warstomp wouldn't be put on cd etc it changes the entire dynamic.
---
I'm not sure why you're hung up on it being more or less skilful, it is different though and does change what is and isn't possible to react to
---
hate to be a downer as i love your other ideas, but this one just makes me ask, why....
---
&gt; I'm a trustfund kid and I will have a huge wealth by 30 in 5 years
---
Just a bit of friendly advice. (Trying not to sound patronising). That kind of mentality usually makes people very unhappy with their life. Had a few friends over the years have the same mindset and they have all ended up miserable, despite being very wealthy.
---
Just look after yourself and do what makes you happy.
---
you can ALWAYS heal 5 man instances as ret.
---
Just save some secondary items that are stacked on int to make up for it if needed.
---
My favorite part about retail is the systems they put in place to stop you from progressing time gating content. I really like how all the time gated content that only allows you to progress through the game for one to two hours a week become irrelevant whebever the next patch comes out. My favorite part about every patch is that you never have to interact with anyone else to complete the content. I'm so glad they added flying back to the world so you are no longer in any danger ever and the world becomes much smaller. Overall 8.2 is looking exactly like every other patch since WoD. It's so great! (For the first few weeks then it becomes stale and there's nothing to do but mindless world quests)
---
This is a total strawman argument that I always see people using.  Truth is only a very small % of the vanilla world is utilized at 60 as well.  How much time is a level 60 spending in Redridge mountains for example?  Probably the exact same amount of time as a level 70.  Only reasons to possibly be there at 60 are if you’re leveling a new profession of some kind, or you want to gank low level players.  Same for level 70.  
---
The level 60 zones were left behind and replaced with the TBC zones, but who cares?  New content is kind of the point of an expansion.
---
and it was because you're enemy :v
---
Your*
---
Lmao it's not a "slippery slope" to fix annoying shit that little shit heads abuse and needed to be reported for. Not one little bit.
---
Fix it Blizzard
---
&gt; So you'll uninstall the game if there's a queue on day 1? jlawokay.gif. What if there's an hour long queue on day 2? 15 minutes on day 3? What if you have to wait for a whopping 30 seconds on day 4, could you fit that into your busy schedule? What if... On day 10, there is a half second momentary queue when you try to enter the game? Does that delay your gratification enough where you finally quit playing?
---
You have a lot of if's there. I tried to play on some pservers that had 2-3 hour queues 1 month in and with Classic I'm sure it will be the same on some servers. Getting to queue 2-3 hours a day for several weeks is not my idea of a fun time.
---
&gt;Dear god it's like you have created some sort of queue boogeyman, like you think there's going to be queues every day forever and you'll never be able to play the game.
---
I did not. It was created for me by endless failed launches that I experienced first hand and I personally do not find it fun or rewarding or immersive or whatever.
---
And I can use the same argument against you: "Dear god it's like you have created some sort of layering boogeyman, like you think there's going to be layering every day forever and you'll never be able to enjoy the game."
---
At least my fears are based on real past experiences while yours are based on pure speculation.
---
&gt;In REALITY where the rest of us live, you might have queues for a few days max, just like every single other expansion. Then there will literally never be a queue again. That's IF there are queues. If Blizzard put there talents to good use, you'd have enough people spread out over enough servers where you wouldn't have issues.
---
You are right, there won't be any queues because we will have layering.
---
Also your reality is different than mine. You live in your bubble I live in mine. We experience things differently because we lived different lives. You opinions are just that ... yours. And while I see your point of view, you can't spew out biased opinions based on your past experiences and call them facts.
---
&gt; I'm guessing you just have unrealistic fears because you weren't around during prior expansions or something? Or you have read horror stories about bad queues? I assure you those are exaggerated 1000%. And yes literally 1000% because queues were never as long or as lasting as anyone would have you believe.
---
As I said previously, my fears are grounded in past real experiences. These include live servers, private servers and a whole other range of online games. All bad. And they may be a bit exaggerated but nowhere near insignificant as you suggest.
---
&gt;&gt;I give a shit about queues because vanilla WoW already has a lot of downtime and I don't have the luxury to add queueing to that.
---
&gt;This comment makes me think you don't understand the nature of queues at all...
---
This comment makes me think you never worked a day in your life and came home expecting to chill with your friends in a game that you love just to be stuck in a queue for hours and by the time you get in you are to tired to do anything and just call it a day. This only has to happen 2-3 days and all your friends will be way ahead of you and you will be stuck playing alone trying to catch up to them so you can play together.
---
Created 2 Characters in the beginning:

Another post from you about TBC?  Why are you so terrified of TBC?  You’ll have 2 years of vanilla before it’s even a contemplation.  Just enjoy your time...
---
Lock. “LF 2 DPS for RFK, can summon!”
---
You can see someone start casting on a turn based game. It's called initiative. Now imagine with a lower initiative your character got to magically intervene and say, actually I simultaneously cast this and it's allowed for no good reason.
---
It wasn't unconfirmed. It was literally reproduced on video. You tried it after they fixed it. While your main point is fine: *"I’m telling people to calm down with the 'BLIZZARD IS SCREWING UP CLASSIC' nonsense"*, but saying unconfirmed is pretty silly.
---
seeing that it's literally a bug, I doubt we will have it in classic.
---
But I have no heard about anyone testing it no.
---
4 second scatter into 10 second trap. I noticed as well. Perhaps scatter and trap didn't DR when you have clever traps 2/2.
---
Results? It's been 2 days... +1 month
---
Leeway was there back then.  
---
Here is the thing, there is no server in my region, so I will play with at LEAST 180 ping. For me this great.\\
---
If you ever played in a pserver you will know that playing with 20 ping and playing with 200 ping is a fucking lot different, these things like leeway make the adjustments.
---
you get good wand progression from quests.
---
enchanting + tailoring just for getting a wand is something i ditched after some "test leveling" on private servers
---
Sorry, but this is a terrible suggestion that doesn’t even make sense.
---
Is gearing a human warlock easier than an undead mage competition and raid slot wise? Is the difference significant? Stuck between mage and lock and horde vs ally.
---
I think pve is pretty dull it’s more about the effort of preparing that is difficult than any one spec. So going for something weird like boomie/shadow priest might give you an extra button but it’s going to cost you more in time/sanity I think. I’m going mage.
---
Roll UD Rogue. Level as combat with mining and leatherworking for mount at 40, go subtlety Rogue @ 60 for PvP. Change leatherworking to engineering, spam Bg's, Wpvp and hoping to join some casual raiding guilds for gear.
---
Still not sure if I'm gonna have an alt. If so I might roll UD Priest for raids and bg heals! But I doubt I'll find the time to play 2 max level at 60.

Classic WoW expansion announcements would probably ignite a few chaps. If Blizz dropped that bomb, I'm buying popcorn and going to cast this sub on my tv lol
---
Don't know if they are on dynamic respawns, but they respawn a lot faster and more frequently than in vanilla. In vanilla they have like 4+ hours respawn times and there can only be one at a time per zone. There can be several at lotuses per zone on the big LH one i'm playing at now. I mean there are always 20+ lotuses on the AH along with 20+ of each flask type.
---
improved firebolt wouldnt help in any way for farming DM tho... no clue what made you think of that...
---
Look at hunters if you want to check economy's main suspect especially for DM.
---
Orc warriors in higher levels of STV always scared me. They just look like the iconic, badass warrior
---
Could try Shaman. That would add totems to your mix to help
---
A lot of people say that mining isn't as profitable, but I used to make way more gold from Mining than herbs. For example, if you go mining and engineering, you can sell the ammo for huge profit on the AH to people who are happy to spend the gold.
---
In that case the pserver I was on did not have this issue.
---
The server has a tracker with all nodes in it. It shows respawn times. But only a certain number of nodes in the area can be up at the same time. Some nodes are grouped and in those groups only a certain number of nodes can be up at the same time.
---
Some are on independent timers, some are not.
---
...okay, fine. #OneChange
---
It's glorious!
---
Not at all lol. If you know the warrior is about to intercept you can CHOOSE to blind him and will be rewarded for your forethought. In this case it doesnt matter who did it first. The fact that your CC is longer means you actively made his intercept useless. Thats the difference. Saying a 10 is now 12 changes nothing in terms of skill as its still rng and the same for all. There is no way to make sure you are rolling a 12, whereas in my example the outcome changes based on skill
---
fuck tbc
---
Except one of you pressed it first. One of you literally either blinded first or intercepted first. No amount of forethought changes that. The one who did it last is rewarded despite the fact their timing was later.
---
Can you pls link the original video you're referencing, I cannot find it.
---
There will be separate lists for each teir of raid content. Our first list will be Molten Core and Onyxia. 
---
The lists are submitted privately, but maintained publicly. The deadline to submit each list will be a week or two before the first raid of each teir.
---
&gt; I mean there are always 20+ lotuses on the AH along with 20+ of each flask type.
---
That does not imply anything.
---
&gt; In vanilla they have like 4+ hours respawn times and there can only be one at a time per zone.
---
Let us not guess around and avoid spreading misinformation.
---
people think about ruin a lot when it concerns a class they dont wish to pic. but server economy is mainly only affected by either hunters in 1.12.1 along with lotus farming. rogues became the new economy ruin in TBC but warlocks wherent ever the rich type of class.
---
 Its  a bit of a wall of text, but I hope it will help my fellow undecided  mates. I have been struggling with this decision since I knew Classic is  going to happen. As the date of launch draws closer my anxiety grew and  I knew I have to do something about it, so I did what every analytic  person would have done. I tried out some classes and specs that I have  been very curious about. So I began the process of slowly eliminating  the potential candidates by trying them out in PvP and PvE. I basically  just wanted to try and get a feel for all the different classes and  specs and races even.
---
\-I tried an UD  shadow priest, cuz I think sPriest are legit as fuck and you can not  really play a spriest unless you are an UD. My very first character ever  back in vanilla was an UD mage so I really like the animations. I  really love the class fantasy of priests and spriests always strike fear  in my heart so I wanted to be a dark lord, an avatar of shadow myself.
---
\-I  tried a human priest also, cuz I most probably wanna be a hybrid/healer  class this time around (got bored of pure dps, and been tanking a lot  in later expansions). Also, smite spec is very wholesome and I even love  human casting animations better than UD and I think if Im gonna go holy  for PvE and Disc for PvP i need a human. Holy just doesnt suit UD. It  was a blast.
---
\-Time for a shaman, my  second most loved class fantasy of all. being a Big Cow always  fascinated me. Everything just looks so awesome on a tauren and wielding  a big two hander and proccing WF deleting cloth users from existence is  something everybody should experience in WoW. its like PoM-Pyro or  Reckbomb. Also Im in love with nature so generally Shamans and Druids  are very close to my heart.
---
\-And there  was it. The class I feared the most, because I wanted to play him the  most, but I knew I shouldt. To be honest, if I should choose a class  that could represent my personality in WoW the most, it would be either  druid or paladin. So I gave the latter a go. I tried a classic human  paladin and the realisation that you are basically only autoattacking  shocked me to my core, yet I just can not let go of the feeling that  something pushes me to main the class. Gorgeous armors, unkillable,  supporter, and even Ret has some nice moments with procs.
---
So  at the end of the day after trying 4 different classes/specs I narrowed  my choices down to playing either a Human Paladin, or an UD sPriest or a  Human Priest or a Tauren Shaman...
---
Yeah,  if you havent seen the "humor" flair this is the part where I tell you I  have no fucking clue about what I wanna play. I honestly feel like when  the end of august comes Im just gonna stare bluntly at the character  creation screen for 3-4 days without making a single toon. It is one of  the most frustrated I have ever been. I literally watched 100 and 100  hours of guides, in depth analyses, PvP, PvE videos of every single  class avaiable. i know youtube search results by hearth for each and  every class guides. It just fucks my brain so much. Sorry that I could  not help you. And I havent even tried a druid (favourite class fantasy),  or a warlock (most dynamic PvP style) yet...
---
No? Both abilities go off. It doesnt matter who was first. Im starting to feel like you have never pvpd in classic.
---
This was in BC so I could be incorrect about some things:
---
Our MT quit the game, along with our GM. Both of them were really laid-back, great guys. There was never any issues with the MT's tanking.
---
An officer that hated me became the new GM. He appointed my girlfriend as an officer because she's skilled and knowledgeable. We live together which is relevant later.
---
One of his new recruits (a capable healer) wanted her friend recruited, who was a warrior. The only opening we had was for an MT, so even though the healer's friend had never tanked before, he became the new MT.
---
I would pull threat from this warrior while *autoattacking* and casters would pull threat wanding. So I would stop attacking in the middle of a fight and /dance. We didn't kill a single boss with him as the MT. I played a tank through vanilla so I whispered him with some advice on how to tank, he told me to fuck off as he "already knew how to tank".
---
We had a private section on the forum where officers would post discussion threads on recruits. I posted in the warrior's thread that his threat output was simply unacceptable and posted threat meters which showed him to be extremely low. His friend blamed me for the wipes because I was dancing like an asshole instead of doing my job. So I posted a screenshot of my warrior who wasn't even max level that was generating more threat than the recruit.
---
She told her warrior friend that I was trying to get him kicked out of the guild because I wanted to replace him as main tank. He became quite vocal in guild chat which naturally caused some in-fighting. I pointed out that because he was a recruit he should be removed from the guild.
---
The GM had a discussion about me in officer chat and naturally my girlfriend let me know about it, because she sits right next to me. He was outright insulting me and saying that I had become arrogant, I was spreading rumours and making people unhappy etc. so we left the guild on the spot and transferred from the server.
---
I checked back on the server a week later to speak to some people I enjoyed playing with, and all of the quality players had left for another guild.
---
These are the coefficients you will get on your heals from +healing on your gear.
---
Flash Heal: 0.43
---
Power Word Shield: 0.1
---
Holy Nova: 0.114
---
Greater heal: 0.857
---
Prayer of Healing: 0.286
---
Renew: 1
---
Heal: 0.857
---
Now that I have introduced you to the coefficients of your healing spells, I will tell you why I introduced you to them.
---
1. Every time your gear changes or you are able to get a new item piece, you can adjust your stats and see what your spells will heal for now.
---
2. Doing the math and thinking yourself. Figure out yourself which spell would be more useful to use in each occasion. See how this changes with gear ect.
---
-------------------------------
---
Now, I will give you a little hop into the right direction: steps to find the right healing spell.
---
1. First you look at the base healing done of the spell.
---
2. you look at the healing coefficient of the spell (the higher the coefficient, the more it stacks with gear)
---
3. You look at how much it gets affected by talents (end of formula).
---
4. You look at the mana cost and the cast time of the spell (to see when you can use which spell. For example: not a greater heal rank 4 when the target has 10% hp/25% hp).
---
5. Test things out. This formula and this way helps you finding the right spell, but it is not guaranteed that math is always the best way to figure out healing, its mostly experience.
---
I ripped this from a guide I used in 2016 on a private server when I was starting out on my priest. The website I originally found it on seems to be gone, but I found the guide on the wayback machine. If you are serious about getting into priest I suggest going through it, lot's of really good info in there.

[I'm still going to do it in classic](https://imgur.com/Jszn514)
---
The thing is I'm probably autistic. I was always highly competitive in all the wrong causes in my life. I spent years making gold, doing heroics and pvp in wow, after I stopped I went hard to become a lead actor in my college theater group and I was competing over girls like it actually mattered. Now I'm miserable because of my life choices, all my friends(who are also trustfund btw) made their carreers, found their start ups and generally put their lives in order. All I have is a theater class I teach and I dropped out of engineering. My life is a at a stalemate, my family doesn't trust my decisions, I cant re-enroll in school and all I do is wait time pass so I can actually do something. I know there are people in worse situations than me but what hurts me is knowing cristal clearly I am the cause of all my fuck ups.
---
And yet everything you pointed out is the lower tier of things. Ultimately everything  is run by someone above all of those, team, project, state.
---
You and I probably had broadband internet by the time WoW came out, but roughly half the consumer base in the US (at that time) was still on dial up. It's my understanding that dial up connections almost always had a higher ping than broadband, if all other factors were equal (distance from the server, etc.). I'm not a tech expert, but from what I've read, dial up was also more prone to error and having to send the same signal twice. 
---
Ping may not be considerably better for us in 2019, but it may be for the other half of America (I might be erroneously assuming you live in the States - sorry). Again, I'm not an expert, and anyone who is actually knowledgeable is obviously free to come correct me.
---
Basically just enough time for the book to wear off.
---
incorrect. look at any boss fight/arena video of MoP or even Cataclysm. they changed that setting long before WoD. i would say it changed around wotlk or cataclysm.
---
Yes both go off, but only one **should** unless you want to reward people for pressing something **after the fact**
---
It's no different to ignoring initiative on a pen and paper RPG and saying you get to simultaneously cast.
---
This is a HUGE reason subscriber numbers never recover in retail.  Every expansion is basically a self contained story, but they just abandon it every release cycle.  That means every time someone quits mid expansion, they can never come back and see how it concluded because EVERY expansion concludes in raid instances no one even uses raid finder for.  At best you can come back some levels later and maybe solo the instance, but that's only if you're the right class and you're taking time off from the second expansion after.
---
Even worse they actually REMOVED vanilla content from the game.  People wanted flying mounts in base Azeroth because they wanted to use their toys they earned in the last 2 expansions to fly around and see what things were like.  The idea *I* had when they were doing that was that they were going to change a few things to make the map fit together a little better and chalk it up to the cataclysm, not lock and stock replace the entirety of 1-60 content with a worse version of itself.
---
At least BC still had its content mostly untouched in the game.  Vanilla was just flat out GONE, which I think is part of what drives players to it.
---
Hey guys !  
---
I will be playing a warlock on a EU PVE server.  
---
I'm french, I speak english fluently. I don't mind joining a french guild or an english speaking guild, no preferences.
---
I played a mage in vanilla (200 days of /played), I only experienced a bit of MC, BWL and ZG. But I raided a lot in BC and WOTLK : my guild was the first to kill Illidan horde side during BC, and then first kill of the Lich King during WOTLK.  
---
I can adapt to whatever raiding schedule is planned, my only not-free evening is on Thursday, all days are fine to me.
---
I will be no-lifing during 10 days straight, to get to level 60 quickly, and then I will be a little be more mellow...

It’s VC bro
---
Played with a dude named porkloin(orc rogue) a long time ago. His wife left him for another dude she met playing wow and he had to move in with his buddy that played with us.
---
Elsewhere, as in bg's?
---
It was less then 5min. Watched the stream :)
---
That's because it _is_ a completely different game. I don't think it can legitimately be called an MMORPG any more.
---
Can confirm, average price back in Vanilla was 4-5g on a stable server. It's not as great money maker as people seem to think because so many people have Alchemy as their main profession.
---
Damn, you're reading into this too much ...
---
You dumb as fuck mate.
---
Yeah, I ran through 1 - 20 a few times on Private server just to check and improve the time. I'm not gonna speed run, but as with many in here the plan is to get ahead of the bunch in the starting zone. I've taken 2 days off during launch, should be enough to get me to lvl 30 before my daily routine slows me down. I'm not fast at all, but my current time (+ adding some time since classic is slower than private is):  
---
1-12 (\~5 hours) My plan is to do this on the first night before I sleep  
---
12-20 (\~11-13 hours) My plan is to do this after 5-6 hours of sleep until I go to bed the evening on the 27th  
---
20-30 (havent tested, but 12-14 hours is my hope) Goal is to hit 30 before I log off on the 28th.   
---
This is probably slow, but at least I hope this will put me in front of the majority for a good amount off time.
---
Cross-faction teamwork of any kind is against the ToS and will get people banned, they've stated as such in several dev interviews regarding the subject.
---
pretty much, not only that but imp has its own threat table like all pets.
---
Also with all those bonuses if a disc priest where to cast power infusion then that would have a tremendous effect XD
---
It literally isnt out yet.
---
He's just asking if Tauren Druid is the best race/class combo specifically for min-maxing Herbalism, in which case I would say either that or Tauren Hunter for cheetah aspect early levels when running down herbs.
---
I would probably add that picking your race and class to max a gathering profession quickly is probably not the greatest idea, but if that's your jam, that's your jam.
---
Go to Hydra's stream and ask him: twitch.tv/hydramist
---
And what is wrong with layering now?
---
Haven't they already said that they will remove stuff like this before release?
---
Adding invisible walls and such to counteract the spots where you can jump up. I'm almost certain I've read about that some months ago.
---
BC is still in the base game, so if you want to see it you can. Vanilla has been long gone.
---
I'm curious if the other reason is that Vanilla raids are just that much more accessible.  Attunement's aren't crazy, MC, BWL, and Onyxia aren't THAT hard to PUG once you understand basic raiding, and AQ is just dumb bug people and Naxx everyone saw in Wrath.
---
Since Warriors scale the best with gear, does that mean that when you are pre-raid-BiS or MC geared Warriors become good at farming?
---
Or is it still sluggish? Do I need an alt still?
---
I do like retail WoW, both modern and Classic, both varieties.  I'm a WoW fanboy, yep, who'll be playing both versions of it (when Classic actually launches... which it won't for two months).
---
I just happen to be honest about the games.
---
You want to see "fanboys?"  Look at people trying to talk up the "community" for a version of a game that isn't even available yet.  There's literally no community yet, but people are claiming it's the best EVER.  When people are being that dishonest about things, how can you not be accusing *those* people of being "fanboys?"
---
It's good that the community doesn't exist, though.  Because if you considered this subreddit and the WoW forums to be the WoW Classic "community," then said community would involve an extreme amount of complaining about streamers, insulting anyone who likes them, and constantly insulting what WoW would go on to become as well as insulting anyone who likes current WoW (even if they like both versions of "retail" WoW... and yes, Classic is "retail" because you're paying for it).  That is a TERRIBLE "community" to introduce anyone into.  It's not based on love for a thing, it's based on just hate for something else.
---
Oh damn. That looks nice. Thanks for my new wallpaper ma boy.
---
Thats my point tho. The fact that both parties know about the batching and the rogue actively decides to try to hit the batching window with blind. It doesnt matter if he casts its first or not, he is rewarded the same. The whole point im trying to explain is that it opens up to a whole new skill that has to be learned and can be used in interesting ways to your advantage.
---
In a turn based game even if you could interrupt someone else's turn actions generally aren't resolved simultaneously and there's no aspect of timing involved so the result wouldn't be the same. The mechanic is also being universally applied to everyone so it wouldn't be like you're insinuating with someone changing the rules on the fly to their own benefit.
---
&gt;As for it being skillful you are the one who claimed it
---
Understanding how batching works, how to manipulate it and reacting correctly is a skill. Otherwise everyone would be out there gouging blinks, countering cc with their own instant cc etc which isn't going to be the case
---
&gt;people in your life that matter
---
Damn casuals.
---
It would be so nice if this could be separated in the combat logs.
---
Scenarios:
---
Spell hit check. Spell Misses, Output: Spell miss
---
Spell hit check. Spell hit, Output: Fully resisted due to targets level of resistance. (this can happen on binary and non-binary spells)
---
Spell hit check. Spell hit, Output: Partially resisted due to targets level of resistance. (this only happens on non-binary spells)
---
Spell hit check. Spell hit, output Full damage.
---
Damn. And here I thought i was clicking on a light hearted, in depth discussion on the UBRS Leeroy mechanic.

I'll go finish my coffee now.

Catch a rare fish during the stv fishing tourney (2 hours every Sunday to try to get it) and get a hat with 15stamina.
---
If a tank can't hold threat over heals, then they are doing something wrong, you should be able to fade and be good if somehow you pull threat. I always did take threat reduction talents for dungeons though, cause you never know what group you will get if you aren't running with just friends.
---
If you are rage starving the tank by bubbling them, especially at the start of a fight, then it might be on you. ;)
---
Getting a raid slot as an alliance warlock is going to be wildly easier than getting a raid slot as horde mage. You can get slots as anything though, so play what you want. Only players who want to play super casually yet still raid should really care about having character select screen disallow them from finding a guild; if you want to play a lot and raid AND you want to be an UD rogue, then be a UD rogue like everyone else and show Kel'thuzad what's up.
---
Mine is Astern Kingdo
---
Yeah, feral druid has great objective potential in battlegrounds, in wpvp they're just so versatile that you always have a truck to pull off when in need, and for pve they can definitely tank, might now have as good dmg mitigation as a warr tank, but they hold aggro in 5 man dungeons better.
---
(Although good warriors go 2h arms ranking to dish out dmg in 5mans, especially when playing with friends.)
---
I like to call it CB: Cave Boat. Can't mistake that for any other dungeon.
---
That trinketing from the character protrait.   
---
Wish i was half this skilled back then.
---
LuL ofc it’s DM, Van Cleef took the rights first, dire maul released afterwards (lol)
---
Sigh.
---
That has nothing to do with sharding, it's because the node was already looted 30 seconds ago and is now despawning.
---
Even very well geared warriors are not as good at solo farming as a braindead, green-geared hunter or mage. Not as good at farming gold, items, or soloing quests.
---
If farming is really big to you, consider mage or hunter in addition to warrior.
---
He is abso-fucking-lutely **not** rewarded the same. Both abilities remove the control of the opposing charscter, the fact that one was used first but both go off undeniably rewards the one who used it second far more.
---
It's not "skill" to be able to use an ability afeer control has already been lost because of some arbitrary window. It's the absolute opposite of skill. It allows you to react **after** something has already happened that should prevent you from reacting.
---
Imagine playing a game of football and adding a rule that the ball has to be in the goal for two seconds otherwise it doesn't count. That's not skill, it's pure arbitrary nonsense that allows you to discount something that should have happened after it happened.

&gt;Thirteenera#8084
---
Hey, I sent you an invite on discord :)
---
So my opinion isn’t an unpopular one?
---
While for some reason I feel like you are person I hope to never meet let me tell you one thing anyway. 
---
You made choices in your life that put you where you are but you have no idea what could have happened if you made different or "better" choices, for all we know you could have died because of that. There is no point in beating yourself up about what could have been because 
---
A)You can't change that
---
B)The outcome could be much worse
---
Aren’t totems totally utility in classic though?
---
I won't pretend to be a great healer, I however a great tank. I would never bubble a tank in vanilla. So far I've had to tell every single priest I've played with to stop shielding me. The best is one who said he was a Priest for the last 10 years. So I told him vanilla was 15 years ago and had him bubble me, I had a mob hit me and it proved my point.
---
The final straw in BfA for me as a DK tank
---
Guild 1: Grouped with since BfA launch, guaranteed me a raid tank spot
---
Guild 1, literally the night before the first raid: "hey so, you can dps, but our irl friend is gonna tank"
---
Me: "I don't even have a dps spec because I was told I was fine to tank... And I'm ranked much higher than that guy on (whatever the gear score site was called, I forget)" 
---
Guild 1: "it's cool just do your best."
---
Guild 1, after raid night "yeah uh your dps sucks so we're kicking you byeeeeee"
---
So I find a other guild, specifically created for people fucked over buy their previous guilds who just want to be chill and progress together. They guarantee me a tank spot.
---
Guild 2 literally does the exact same thing, night before raid 1, replace with a much worse tank they're buddies with, dps too low, kick.
---
My roommate and I unsubbed on the spot as soon as guild 2 pulled that shit.
---
I am so bored with every game out there. I just want to play Classic...
---
You can absolutely choose anything if your group is focused on PvP. If you reaaaally think you're going to level entirely together and do dungeons as 5 while at the same level, you can go for Warrior or Druid.
---
Alternatively, since you like being a ranged 1v1 pvp player, you could pick mage, power-level past your friends, and carry them through WC while they're 20 and you're 56. Up to you!
---
Or just limit it to starting zones for the first 2 weeks, and that’s it.
---
Lower tolerance to mass report
---
I don't think you are autistic (assuming that was a serious consideration). Obviously I don't know you and I can only go off what you have wrote here, but I get the impression that you are more demotivated that you haven't found a calling in life, a reason to apply yourself. You're clearly a savvy individual, but without feeling determination you are doomed to fail. What you need is to find a passion for something and work towards that.
---
Late millenials started with vanilla.
---
Wotlk was a nice mix. At least you had heroic versions that were abit more involving.
---
I'd take a 20 min tough dungeon over 40 min trash fest that is most of classics dungeons... with little challenge.
---
If blizz offered heroics and achievements in the future is vote yes in a heart beat.
---
There is an aspect of timing involved. I already told you. It's called initiative.
---
Batching ignoring when a spell actually lands is no different to ignoring initiative and simultaneously resolving.
---
You don't even need to know how batching works to manipulate it. It happens automatically cos there's a bloody fifth of a second window pulsing in the background. If you want to count that as a "skill based interaction" then logging in is also skill based because you need to be able to type your character name. If that's the bloody standard we are setting for skills here.
---
For rogues: you can avoid combat if you stealth immediately after looting, no need to waste vanish!
---
Cant speak for vanilla but people reserved stuff in TBC all the time on my german server.
---
Yeah. Can't dispel Mana burn, only have a stun and no interupt
---
People need to man the fuk up and not be such snowflakes, how about that.
---
This is exactly my current state. I do think that I have it figure it out...for now.
---
Undead female spriest with alch and herb :)
---
Careful though, as the warrior and rogue might end up competing for equipment.

Go back to BFA
---
Well. Yes pretty much. 
---
But mixing totems and casting the right ones  at the right time  would add to casting “two heals” and may make it seem less dull at times. 
---
Outside of that with any class there is downranking to consider, pre casting, and mana management that you could either enjoy or find frustrating.
---
I might have not been paying attention, but is Gilneas under control of the alliance? I understand that it's an active battlefront.
---
But the city itself is desolate right? (lorewise)
---
I thought the forsaken kinda drove the Worgen out with the plague.
---
And then the Worgen had to live in Darnassus (and now stormwind).
---
Best class to combo with an Undead Priest?  
---
My friend and I are planning on levelling together 1-60 like we did back in the old days.  Back then I ran Undead Mage so probably try for that again so we can AOE farm together.  The downside being that we compete for gear constantly.  
---
Any other good combos?  I would say Warrior but the responsibility of tanking scares me!
---
I'm thinking Undead Mage with Tailoring/Enchanting.
---
As in dungeons, raids, stuff like that. I found mine pretty boring in PvE.
---
I mean... technically content has always been time gated... it's just it used to be that they released the game all at once, and then kept releasing new content for free to keep you playing.
---
Hell, they APOLOGIZED when Black Temple wasn't finished in time for TBC.
---
Now you wait 2 years for the same amount of content that would come out in the base patch back then.
---
Of course, I'm sure Blizzard would disagree, but I'm sure Blizzard considers every difficulty of a raid and every size of a raid to be a totally different raid encounter.
---
Reminds me of a friend who was convinced he could tell if somebody was a horde or alliance players based off of their haircut IRL alone.
---
The first mob I killed dropped a cape and a six slot bag on the stress test. I have a few bags and almost a full set of armor before I left. These drop rates seemed a lot higher than most private servers, where you could go until level ten without 4 bags and have to buy them from a vendor.
---
but but only 60 days left to pick shaman rogue warlock priest.... etc
---
Yes. In premade wsg, rogue's role is pretty much just sitting at flag and waiting.
---
He googled it, and even linked some results. They don't address his question.
---
what if you are on an active account currently even playing world of Warcraft but do not have a subscription
---
As an exclusive Hunter main from back in the day, being a problem while leveling makes sense. We were pretty strong from the get-go especially when classes don't have their better abilities until later. In world pvp at 60, it depends on who you're going against and whether they have full Warlord or Tier3+ gear on. We could still tag people with Viper or Scorpid to annoy you though hahaha. Rogues are the up-close assholes, we're the far away ones. :) However, Paladins(plate, low mana infinite heals, stupid long stun), well geared(and with all the cooldown reductions to Intercept as possible) Warriors(effing plate), and soullink Warlocks(durable af and those dots) were always the biggest challenge for me. They felt like pretty hard counters tbh. Sadly even killing a Warlock still meant you'd die from DoTs afterwards. It was always a wash with them :T. Our Pets are basically nothing later on, besides some interruption to casting and unfortunately fueling a warriors rage. BM Hunters were very strong in wpvp, but with a lot of weaknesses once that cooldown was gone. I can't wait to relive it all over again.
---
Play Dead by Daylight, Deathgarden or Dauntless. Problem solved
---
How is it against rule 2? Is the word 'garbage' too harsh for you? Not sure whether thats funny or sad.
---
I greatly look forward to it :)
---
"Heellooo"
---
I thought HoTs/DoTs can’t crit?
---
Wrong game Reddit then. Off you pop to wotlk pserver.
---
With the beta now being 6 weeks old, those who have been fortunate enough to spend time with it have begun to notice a few things which warrant a conversation about their implementation in WoW Classic.  Today, the listeners touch on some of those points.
---
We first hear all about melee leeway and get some further commentary on the layering examples that we’ve seen pop up thus far.  This is followed by a correction from an IT expert on the technical side of layering as touched on in earlier episodes.
---
From there, we hear all about how the AV weekend went, and then about a couple of server firsts in the third stress test from a pair of speed runners.
---
And, finally, we hear once again from vanilla WoW dungeon designer John Staats, all about the making of Scholomance.
---

Cheers,

---
Maybe the leeway should be dynamic. The higher your ping the bigger leeway you get.
---
&gt;There is an aspect of timing involved. I already told you. It's called initiative.
---
initiative decides turn order, when it's your turn there's no reaction time involved.
---
&gt;Batching ignoring when a spell actually lands is no different to ignoring initiative and simultaneously resolving whenever you feel like.
---
It's not whenever you like, it's predetermined windows.
---
&gt;You don't even need to know how batching works to manipulate it.
---
to consistently manipulate it in your favour you need to know how it works
---
Chetvichoi?
---
Why not leave it as it was in vanilla, you know, for that authentic vanilla experience that blizzard themselves have said they want to create?
---
I swear 90% of the people posting pictures here haven't heard of the snipping tool or hitting print screen.
---
When they get crit they heal for a % of damage taken
---
What if you never paid for World of Warcraft ? Like, never buying the original game nor any extensions, should active time will be enough ?
---
It’s true, also the “feel” of the game, movement etc is much smoother on the new engine
---
Hey guys, what are your thoughts about duo leveling as a shaman and mage?
---
I'll be duo leveling witf my wife and sometimes playing in groups with our friends.
---
She will be playing mage. I'm not sure which spec should I play as a shaman.
---
"All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind." - Bob Ross
---
He should have gone to the same spot on a 1.12 client and compared the distances.
---
Ok, good to hear! Thanks for the clarification.
---
Thanks! I look forward to listening to this. I hope they change the leeway mechanic.
---
The start of tbc was mad. Soooo much raids and content. Good times
---
Except no you don't need to in order to consistently manipulate it. It happens automatically. You need to consistently use skills at around the same time, you don't need to understand why it results or how it results in both going off at the same time.
---
It's predetermined Windows which are constantly going off, it is whenever you like.
---
Pressing a button first should decide spell order, there should be no reaction involved unless it's a quicker spell. You're literally aruging in favour of being able to react simultaneously on someone else's turn.
---
It’s all empty, because people are bored of playing and don’t give a shit about bug testing, just like every new person would be.
---
Just call it what it is, sharding.
---
It's cool when you find a channel fine with self promotion.
---
But just a heads up but this sub will be flooded with YouTube/twitch stream self promotions come launch day.
---
Holy crap I remember watching the Blizzcon stream when it was announced like it was yesterday
---
There are many zones you never go back. The difference is that gilneas has a great city but they never made a capital for worgen out of it. I would set my hearthstone there because the look is too good
---
**Mage: Undead or Gnome?**
---
Which race is the best overall? (PvP, PvE, Aesthetics, Lore, Faction benefits)
---
Whats your pick and why?
---
I really don't understand what you mean by "who used it second", in the examples I've given you it literally doesn't matter who was first or second. If the rogue was first to blind, but intercept still goes off, the rogue is rewarded exactly the same because that was the whole desired outcome regardless. 
---
I think you are not 100% sure how the batching works, you still have to predict what they are going to do. You can't react to blink and rely on batching to CC him after the fact, that's not how batching works, it would already be too late at that point. Same goes for charge, if he's already charging you, the spell has already gone off, you need to input your ability within the batching window, so that means you need to predict that he's going to charge you. How is that not a skill? 
---
It's not like you can input the blind ability while you see a warrior charging towards you or a mage blinking away. [https://youtu.be/WtMsTlNowQ0?t=97](https://youtu.be/WtMsTlNowQ0?t=97) Here's an example of a skilled rogue predicting the warrior's intercept and blinding within the same batching window. Notice how they appear at the exact same time and he doesn't blind him while he is charging towards him?
---
Did I say I'd rather wotlk?
---
Just recognised the positives and don't pretend classic is perfect.
---
And that the no changes crowd will limit the game.
---
"MC, BWK and ONY are too easy!"
---
Let blizzard tweak or add heroic/achievement rewards to make them harder then?
---
"NO CHANGES REEEEEEEE"
---
I played before Dire Maul launched and we used to call it DM, but then people later switched.
---
It's the motion blur of servers.
---
Ah that's a shame, ok thanks:)
---
I'm torn between Gnome Warlock and Orc Warlock
---
I want to do both PvP and PvE
---
As Orc I think it would be easier in PvP (25% stun resist + no wotf)
---
As Gnome, it would be easier gear up in PvE (less alliance warlocks)
---
Can you help me decide?
---
Cow Punch Simulator?
---
These seem somewhat over-complicated.
---
One-way shift into bear from any form, or cycle bear form by holding alt:
---
    /cancelform [noform:1][mod:alt]
---
    /cast !Bear Form
---
Ditto for cat:
---
    /cancelform [noform:2][mod:alt]
---
    /cast !Cat Form
---
Ditto for travel/aquatic form:
---
    /cancelform [noform:3][mod:alt]
---
    /cast [swimming] !Aquatic Form
---
    /cast [outdoors] !Travel Form
---
Also, `/stopcasting` isn't necessary anymore; the game knows whether a given spell can avoid the GCD.
---
leeway belongs in the past, the only range diff on melee in 2019 should be based on 1h vs 2h or others vs tauren.
---
If you only use reddit on your phone then you would have to send the screen to your phone etc and that's so much effort for quickly taking a picture
---
Going to level a Warrior will tank at lvl 60. 
---
What professions should I go with and why?
---
I've been trying to decide between blacksmithing and engineering obviously mining would be one of the profession. However I'm open to ideas what are your thoughts?
---
You don’t have a choice to go full ham or not as a shaman, if windfury decides to proc successively you absolutely will pull aggro from a tank.  That and our interrupt, highest damage, instant cast spell that doesn’t take a debuff slot has about as much threat as sunder.  This problem persisted all the way through TBC, I was pulling aggro on Gruul with dungeon blues and quest greens as offspec enhancement with no way to reduce aggro.  The only way to not shoot up ktm is to just sit auto attacking.
---
I like both retail and classic. I am the ultimate lifeform. Purity of essence unified with purity of form.
---
if I'm honest with you I wasn't really sure about any of the zones I put in kalimdor, I don't spend much time there and EK has always had the lore, zones and races that interested me the most
---
Instead of me explaining all my issues with it you can look at these 2 videos, they bring up many issues.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ
---
Dead mines is VC, it's for the best.
---
You won't be hoping around casting hots. You will be far more static and controlled than that. Also: depending on your faction, Druids are going to be crowded as hell right now. We're seeing numbers in polls and on beta that indicate we're almost as populous as many DOS classes, like hunters and warlocks.
---
I suddenly realize I've never been to the Brill inn prior to Cataclysm.
---
Maybe he doesn't want to open Reddit on his computer. It makes sense for me.
---
lol? you get shit honor per kill in a 40man hahaha
---
Me too!!
---
The whole debate is just a meme for noobs.  Nobody calls dire mail DM, it's always DME, DMW, DMN, or Tribute.
---
So, have an entertaining five man group with a holy priest as DPS, a holy paladin for heals judging crusader with the rest points talented. Then you have a dps who is also a backup healer. Sounds entertaining. 
---
Hell, a couple instance would be easier with shackle undead all over. Run a priest and paladin mixed party for those for a holy crusade themed dungeon run!
---
Its DM as it comes first in the playlist same way GOW means God of War not Gears of War, most commonly at the time everyone used GeoW to shorten it.
---
In short use DiM for dire maul.
---
And so what? Seriously don't get why you want to whine about it. Not like you're going to print the picture and hang it on the wall. You get the point, don't you?
---
I honestly don't see how this world work, or how it would at all be profitable.
---
There's going to be so many people playing, few chests, bad loot in the chests, etc...
---
I just don't see the point?
---
6506 days since WoW was announced ;)
---
I’ll give you that undead are probably better in pve, because mobs aren’t going to cleanse your plague and it’s a nice damage/healing boost every 3 minutes.. but troll is definitely superior in all pvp formats. Hex of weakness is OPPRESSIVE, shadowguard has crazy synergy with your talents.. mini lust is just ok. It works better for moments when you need to drop shadowform to heal than it does for actual burst damage since you get the most effect out of it at low hp. But the most underrated part of troll spriests is the regen. Pads your lifesteal, and you get more benefit over the healing because of PW:S absorbing damage while you heal up. Combine that with spirit tap in bgs, and if you can time your KBs with a good mind blast you can double your regen
---
You will find out soon. Before raids and during leveling its not that important. In 5 mans preraid you will notice that your healing power is not strong enough for proper downranking. This will change after you get some decently raid gear. Thats the funny thing about playing a healer: your gameplay changes (:
---
This looks so stupid in my opinion, and part of why I like vanilla wow more.
---
I've told you several times. I know both go off at the same time. I know with spell batching it doesn't matter who pressed it first.
---
The argument is that it should matter, and without spell batching it does matter. Since we are discussing why spell batching exists, it means you have to literally discuss it mattering if someone presses it first.
---
The reward is absolutely, categorically not the same, because without batching the person who pressed first has their ability land first. Meaning once you introduce batching the person who pressed their ability first loses out. 
---
You're comparing batching to itself in your own comments. You're saying batching rewards both the same, when you use batching. Well great? I don't care. I'm not disputing that. I'm disputing that it unfairly rewards one player because you've forced both spells to be simultaneous even though they're not.
---
You don't need to "predict" someone is going to charge you, you need to press blind within up to a full fucking fifth of a second after they have **already** charged you. That's the opposite of a prediction, it's a **reaction.**
---
When people say LFG DM they're never talking about Dire Maul because otherwise they'd say LFG DMW/DMN/DME or maybe DM full clear.
---
I only started playing in BC but the naming was never an issue. DM always meant Deadmines on my server.
---
Demand is why people are going herb. Though people didn't meta from day one like they are to do in classic, so you just might be one of the few suppliers.
---
Yeah, this is gona need a tuning.
---
It was fixed like 5 times with different ways to resurrect the pet. It was definetly not intended by blizzard for people to use it and I don't know of a way that existed in 1.12.
---
Not gonna lie... I half expected a Skyrim transition at the end there.
---
It actually only worked for like a month during Vanilla, and was fixed prior to 1.12 so I really doubt it would be possible in Classic.
---
Did you practice by only killing one mob every couple of minutes and only finishing one or two quests? Because that's how it is gonna be at launch with hundreds of people in the starting zone.
---
That would open the door to exploiting. It's trivial to change your ping on demand by withholding packets for X ms. And then back down again by not withholding them.
---
If imp truly scales 1:1 from spell power from the arcanite debuff and if that bonus 300+ doesnt benefit from any of the other bonuses then vs a lvl 63 boss lvl target it would deal exactly 666 damage :D
---
also accounted for the 17% spell miss/resist chance, assuming pet will also have that but its hard to say for sure \^\^ who knows maybe pets have a much lower etc.
---
Completely agree, they took it waayyy to far
---
You can decide to not do anything with a whole guild if most of the members are assholes, no need to note every single name then
---
Hi
---
Yeah, I get the layers will have higher populations. How will that change being able to hop layers to look for spawns? 
---
Layers are per world not per zone, like sharding. 
---
So, even if all the layers are perfectly, evenly populated doesn’t mean that the populations will be evenly distributed throughout the world. I don’t understand how that is even disputable. 
---
Just because a zone is packed on one layer doesn’t necessarily mean it will be on another.
---
and the thing about ice cream is...everyone likes a different flavor
---
So many people will be trying to level gathering profession and sell them on the AH to afford the amount. I played on 3 vanilla launch and its always the same thing.
---
Religious wars have started for less than this question.
---
I can't wait. The last 5+ years we've seen nothing but cash grabs and participation trophy theme parks. I haven't had staying power in a single game in well over 5 years. Last game I could survive past a month of new car smell was LOTRO and Wow 1.x - 3.x. Just tried going back to ESO again for my bi-yearly "lets log in and check out the new scenery for a minute" foray, yea.... ummm... nope.
---
Although I'm pretty much burned out on 1.x now after playing 2 private servers for the last several years... Ready for BC already. Let's see if classic can survive long enough to get there and retain enough population to support a serious R&amp;D effort on classic going forward.... and hope this isn't a "they've cried about vanilla, let's give it to them and shut them up" move and then it gets reduced to a skeleton crew.
---
I fear the latter. Hope I'm wrong.
---
Orc has pet damage, which is nice for leveling but not overly useful at 60.
---
Gnome has escape artist, which isn't as good as stun resist of course, but it's something to help out in PvP at least.
---
What puts gnomes ahead for me is the intellect bonus. And Alliance cities are much nicer anyway.
---
For me it's the addition to Blood Elves for the Horde. It ruined the faction fantasy forever for me. I've played them, and I like the race. I just don't like them being with the Horde.
---
It's not only that lorewise I still think they shouldn't be with the horde, it's that thematically they don't fit at all. 
---
An orc running around Silvermoon just doesn't go for me. A blood elf questing in the crossroads is so weird.
---
I kinda have the same thing with the Forsaken being a horde race, but at least they've got the "evil" look going on for them. The Blood elves just look way to civilized/clean to be allied with the orcish horde, especially back then in TBC when the horde wasn't as Iron heavy as it was since Cata.
---
And then we leave Azeroth behind completely, and spend the next 2 years in outland, which looks great but also really doesn't feel like the rest of World of Warcraft. 
---
Hellfire/Nagrand/Terokkar and Blade's edge I could get behind. Shadowmoon/Zangarmash and Netherstorm look too alien. Not a problem for a few zones but you stay within these areas for the entirity of the endgame so it kinda just turns into "Warcraft in space".
---
Northrend still felt alright on that part.
---
I don't get how they managed to flop the movie... Warcraft has so much lore and so many nice areas visualized in it... really pathetic that we won't be getting any more movies.
---
I remember upgrading to 4GB ram and thinking that should fix the lag in Ironforge.
---
I never thought about it like that. But you are right. The blood elves are supposed to be named in honor of the tragedy that killed 90% of their population. 
---
And in WoW you sometimes feel like the horde are only made out of Blood Elves.
---
How? Was this some early patch where there was no GY in Felwood? Or was your corpse up in those mountains above Ashenvale, and the game decided you should rez in Splintertree?
---
There is this button on beta where you can send a report of things that doesnt work properly. I would even dare to say its why you got invited to play.
---
Why is this here
---
It’s been 600 days since the announcement and 15 years since release and you guys still don’t know what class to play. Y’all need Jesus
---
Can't wait to log onto my hunter and rek scru- I mean contribute fairly to the ecosystem and not gank anybody in STV from shadowmeld. None at all.
---
I didn't say it was ideal, just that it *is*.  Tribalism explains the appeal of nazi-ism, but it doesn't justify the result.
---
Content looks fun but... My class is still shit to play, so no thanks.
---
Can compete at what stage of content? And why r7 paladin? I’ve wondered this myself—especially in PvP. Can a tri spec Priest deal serious damage in BGs with the right tools
---
Fantastic haha! I was in discord with my friend and when the reveal trailer started I half expected "vanilla timewalking" to pop up followed by me breaking my keyboard
---
1. It is pay 2 win. It wouldn't exist if it wasn't and you also contradict yourself on this point by bringing up godly BoE items. There are also BoE components to epic items like Benediction you can buy with gold.
---
2. I hope you account gets hacked by the gold sellers if you buy gold. Nothing personal - I just think you shouldn't do it.
---
Awesome
---
my /who nazjatar has 16 people... mechagon has 7...
---
I know this is frowned on by mods but seriously do what I did and join an instant 60 server and mess around with all the classes. You'll get a feel of which ones you'll like or don't like and won't be constantly questioning yourself over class choice.
---
Oh for sure, small upgrades it's fine. It's ridiculous when there is problems in progressing and people pass up on decent loot for a small chance on that BiS which might or might not drop the next raid.
---
I think batching is a good thing, and you'll see it in a lot of old wow movies too. 
---
If you read your opponent well, you can counter a lot of their moves.
---
I explained in my original post... gold sellers don't interact with most of those money sinks because ALL they do is farm gold. And if they do interact with them, it is minimally.
---
It's not vanilla unless someone in your guild has to stop raiding because he got deployed to Iraq
---
I dipped into FF14 to have some fun gaming. Except for the lack of Grid, I'm a healer main, it's been great fun.
---
Whats the big rush for
---
R7 isnt required by R7 gloves grant +20 holy sp to their crusader seal which is amplified by 15% from talents thus resulting in 181+ sp total with gloves.
---
It is the 1.12 version of AV and there will be no extended battles, unless both sides want to do some kind of RP thing. There just isn't any incentive to hanf out in AV for hours on end in 1.12
---
I mean, the Vanilla golds value will not exist anymore. DM farm can give like 50-100gold/hour
---
Ofc it was done during Vanilla too, but it was like 10-20% of the players. In Classic it's gonna be like 80-90%. Making a huge difference.
---
I'm fine with both anyway because i'm gonna abuse everything like this.
---
Even if the spreadsheet was written by yourself, I simply cannot fathom how you or anyone else is able to follow a guide in this format properly while leveling.
---
I'm the dev of [vanilla-questing](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/) and alot of people have been requesting multiplayer routes, but all my spare time goes into optimizing the single player ones. If you're up for it, you could convert your spreadsheet data into JSON ([example](https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing/blob/master/src/routes/alliance/shared.json)) and import it.
---
&gt;Except no you don't need to in order to consistently manipulate it. It happens automatically.
---
You can benefit from it just from rng, but to consistently have it work in your favour you do need to know how it works. Not doing so is disadvantageous
---
&gt;Pressing a button first should decide spell order, there should be no reaction involved unless it's a quicker spell. 
---
Some people like being able to counter cc and use other mechanics that come from batching
---
&gt;You're literally aruging in favour of being able to react simultaneously on someone else's turn.
---
The windows are predetermined and applied universally, it's different than interrupting someone's turn with no recourse
---
You're ignoring the fact that the pet had a nasty effect of combat locking and denying my ability to trap and my pet consumed only meat and it was not cheap. You're also missing the real point I was making, that WoW is more than patch 1.12 and that pets were pretty damn shit until they were fixed over a multitude of patches and the outrage against pet pathing is laughable when there were worse problems.
---
I also see no one pointing out the bug of pets getting a spirit rez in bgs alongside you because that sure enough isn't "classic wow"
---
For mining, there is that cave in Wetlands that has that weird ore for a quest you can mine to really help out in the early levels. Lots of nodes. I might have to head over there even as horde if the going gets tough.
---
Eh, I don't agree with you and I don't like comparing leeway with batching. Bringing batching back is due to mechanics consistency. You could "feel" batching in original WoW too because 2 players CCing one another was common and something you expect could happen in Classic if you want to emulate experience. Leeway was something you couldn't really experience back in the day because our internet connections sucked so it was just an anti-lag mechanic - you couldn't consistently test it and feel it because it was hard to distinguish where it was a mechanic and when you just lagged out.
---
Batching should stay, leeway shouldn't.
---
Started off in Plagued Lords of Dethecus &lt;PLOD&gt; then moved to &lt;Kabal&gt; and then lastly formed &lt;Rest in Pieces&gt; with some friends. RiP formed at the very end of vanilla and did some pretty hardcore raiding in TBC, we ended up being the second horde guild to kill Illidan.
---
I'd like to welcome newcomer Ayle to Countdown! Great too hear a new voice on the podcast!
---
Ayle and I became close friends on the beta in Shimmering Flats when we traveled long and far to see each other. [Ayle and me](https://clips.twitch.tv/DeterminedColdbloodedWrenGivePLZ)
---
Fair enough, but we are all friends and plan to go many dungeons while including some newbies.
---
We want to focus on building some friendships around us and will take care that nobody misses out and if anyone really wants a specific item we go this dungeon again. :-)  
---
And most importantly: we will get the whirlwind axe for our warrior as soon as possible... ;-)
---
Mouse over wasn't added until after vanilla IIRC.
---
I feel the same, batching can be frustrating but it's fun and makes the game feel unique, there's no excuses for leeway though.
---
no one ever said GeoW. wtf you on about? Gears of war was always shortened to just gears.
---
You can counter their moves after they have **already done them.** Why you'd think that's a good thing is beyond me.
---
Imagine if you are playing golf and you score but if I lift the ball out wihhin two seconds well then it doesn't count and that's a good thing and I've "countered your move"
---
I did the entry into Nazjatar, and I thought it was a good time so far. Biggest issue I had was being eaten alive by every single class as an Enh shaman in world pvp. 
---
I mean, the classes were never going to change. The new heart system is a progression system that we have 1 of 3 slots for and likely no one has unlocked more than the first option.
---
How? Private servers are notoriously buggy when it comes to melee pvp range. All the out of range bugs and shit, they might have been dealt with by a bandaid fix but it's not perfect.
---
I have a lot of fun with hunter and it’s probably the most fun class for me and I enjoy pvp a lot but I’m not hardcore ab it or anything and I’m going to prioritize pve, but I’ve heard hunter can be tough to gear and get group spots, so I’ve been trying to decide if I should main hunter or not. I enjoy healing as well and had fun with shaman so I could also main that.
---
There has been rabid fanboyism to the point of zealotry about keeping the game as classic as possible. There's a couple trees missing outside of Stormwind, quick, rage post on b.net! What really bakes my noodle is people attempting to build 15 year old computers to play the game again. I truly think those are the people blinded by pure nostalgia, and it will fade fast for them. It's easy to look back and chuckle on the fact you had to face your camera down in a raid because you got 5 FPS, but trying to replicate that now for "the best classic experience" they'll soon find it's fucking horrible and realize they're idiots for thinking it would be fun. It's not my place to tell people how to enjoy their experience, but intentionally gimping the game further by running old hardware is a novelty that will become tedious in minutes. We're not all 12 any more and have the patience to wait 3 minutes for a webpage to load, so any form of input lag and drop in frames will wear on the user almost immediately.
---
Here's [my contribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYSSiHh9ShU) to the thread. Just glad that I hit record so I can show the world xD
---
Who can *only* use Reddit on a phone but also had a pc to play wow with?
---
Yes it is
---
You're very wrong about ping. I played on the beta and was able to get consistent 200-250ms ping from US server while being from the EU. I had 400+ ping from US server 15 years ago and 200-250 from EU (now I have 50ms ping response from EU servers).
---
Classic won't make most people that play bfa happy either. Classic has an audience. It slightly overlaps with the audience for retail. Retail also caters to many other kinds of players that will not find much in classic that will keep them playing.
---
Wow has become about one thing. Flash traffic cash grabs that they over-market and over-hype.
---
I tried going back to WoW few weeks ago on a lazy Sunday. I couldn't take it. The unbearable levels of toxicity, self-centeredness, and hostility. I absolutely couldn't even stand 3 hours of it. I got into one toxic group after the next and in between everything I saw or read in chat was toxic. Not to mention the game is a flipping \*ghost town\*. My god, I've never seen it this bad and they still have well over a year before the next retail major version bump.... Even Cata wasn't this bad at this point. Both my guilds, one of which was a joint US/Europe/Aussie guild that had nearly 50 players online at any given time of the day at BFA release had fewer than 5 people who had logged in within the last month. I hopped on to the old discord channel to find they are now scattered between GW2, LOTRO legendary and ESO.
---
I pray to god these type players can't last in classic. All my hopes are pinned on this. Because I've gotten to the point where it doesn't even matter how great a game is, now days the online experience has become so unbearable and so intolerable that I've literally gone back to playing single player games like fallout 4 and Skyrim and even joined a weekly PnP D&amp;D group.
---
So your reason for not liking the comparison even though they're were **objectively** both there and both the result of the infrastructure of the time, is that you **might** subjectively be able to **feel** one and not the other?
---
You couldn’t just quit the group if there was a wipe and requeue with the dungeon finder to find a better group. You were invested with your teammates and needed to figure out, together, how to accomplish your goals. Instead dungeons (and other challenges) just became speed facerolls. (Caveat: I haven’t played since legion).
---
At the end of the day the recent patch was just another band aid to a gaping wound. Until the day comes that they remove the mechanics that damaged the game in the first place, the game will continue to haemorrhage.
---
You sound paranoid
---
Neither of which gives you a realistic perspective.
---
You will learn a lot when you level up, and you won't be fighting people in full tier and with unlimited consumables.
---
It doesn't really become effective until you have lots of +healing. There isn't much of that on leveling gear, so you don't have to worry about it for a while.
---
e.g. (I'm ignoring some details and this isn't exactly right, but it's something like this)
---
with 0 +healing, greater heal 4 costs 655 mana and heals for about 1900 (2.90 healing per mana). heal 2 costs 205 mana and heals for about 460 (2.24 healing per mana). So, the higher rank is both more effective and more efficient. Don't worry about downranking.
---
But with 500 +healing (which gives 500\*3.0/3.5=429 bonus healing to both spells), greater heal 4 heals for about 2330 (3.56 healing per mana). while heal 2 costs heals for about 890 (4.34healing per mana). So now the downranked spell is more efficient. But it's still less effective -- i.e. if you need a lot of healing per second you still need to use the higher rank. 
---
So they're good for different situations.
---
And you could imagine a situation where you do one big heal and then regen for a few seconds, vs spamming little heals -- the time spent regenning makes the big heal more efficient than it looks like. It's complicated. But that's sort of what makes it interesting to play a healer.
---
\&gt;reddit is still free speech
---
lol
---
No changes. You seem to hate classic so off you go.
---
Me and some of my friends had a LAN party that weekend. We kept the blizzcon stream up on my tv, and needless to say we lost our collective shit when it was announced!
---
Its because its bugged on pservers , so they assume its bugged on wow classic .
---
Yes, and I think that is good enough argument because that's the whole reason behind #nochanges - so that we have a game exactly how we felt it played 15 years back. Keeping mechanics that support this feeling is fine IMO even if they are outdated.
---
They aren't required to defend it against violations. The "Aspirin" example comes from people using the name generically to any product similar to Aspirin.
---
Think of it like this. Nintendo protected their trademark by marketing their product as a "gaming console" to prevent too many people from calling other gaming consoles "nintendos".
---
If we apply the same logic to WoW, people would need to be calling other MMOs "World of Warcrafts/WoWs" instead of MMOs. World of Warcraft would be a generic term for any game like it, and thus losing the trademark. So for example if people referred to EVE Online as a World of Warcraft-RPG game instead of an MMO-RPG game.
---
Private servers do not fall under this condition. Private servers are not generic products. They are trying to emulate the game "World of Warcraft" and are free services. At best, it's a violation of copyright since it's using Blizzard's intellectual property (World of Warcraft) to provide a service. Private servers try and get around this by making it free and doing donations to keep the server running. But when sent with a C&amp;D, it can probably be fought in court and would vary on a specific judge's ruling. But instead, they would lose due to not having the sheer resources of Blizzard and go bankrupt before there's even a chance a judge would rule in favor of private server or against.
---
You're not "countering" the CC if it already happened. You're just artificially denying it.
---
That's the point. If you like that then fine, I can't tell you what to like, but I can say it's objectively inaccurate.
---
Male Undead Rogue.
---
I mean each layer will be populated with people. You can't kill a bunch of mobs on one layer and then hop to the next and have a ton more to kill, simply because there will be a shitload of people on each layer. IMO it looks worse on the beta because each layer is empty. With each layer as full as a normal sized realm I don't think abuse will be near as bad as people seem to think.
---
+1 for laintime. He was so utterly next-level for his time. My 15 year old self was absolutely mindfucked at some of the things he was doing with the warrior kit and various trinkets.
---
20 minuters of your life wasted on corpse run
---
Regardless of what people say, blizzard will ban people that go to places like that to win games, its against the ToS and is considered to be an exploit/cheat.
---
If people want to do it a couple of times then get banned, then let them, less scum to play around with.
---
How does one obtain both dweeb and "cool ass guy" status simultaneously?
---
I'd suggest level with mining and engineering, and at some point after hitting 60 you farm materials then roll Blacksmithing/Engineering.
---
I don't have an active sub so therefore no chance of beta, so I have been practicing my early levelling routes on a pserver.  I've no motivation to go further than about level 16 because of Classic but it's been great fun just dabbling again.
---
I'll resub a few days before release.
---
Now make the clock tower match the real clock.
---
So there's a bit of confusion around this. This mechanic did not exist in Vanilla WoW. The melee leeway that existed in Vanilla was effectively the same as the spell leeway, if your melee attack started while the target was in range, it would still complete even if the target moved slightly out of range before the swing landed. What we're seeing here is just a flat added range to moving players *and* NPCs, which was added expansions later.
---
Now I'm far from a "No Changes" guy, but if we want to be accurate, the #NoChanges position would be to remove this mechanic.
---
Back in last gen sites like Neogaf and co always referred to it as GeoW because of confusion.
---
Calm your reeeee down.
---
But you just admitted it was subjective.
---
Which means you have literally no way of distinguishing why you should remove one or and not the other beyond your own self.
---
I want to upvote more
---
This needs to catch on lol
---
It must hurt to know that classic is also "retail" now lol. Both will be live supported games
---
Yes but what is that "bad player" that got carried going to do that's adventegous over other good players?
---
Get carried and get geared? Okay, but they will still suck in Raids and PvP even if they're geared. They will just be a shiny turd.
---
As a passive undead spriest, my experience is always having alliance attack me first.
---
Priests, humans, nelfs very very especially always attack first.
---
In my memory of aggression of years years ago is:
---
Nelfs most aggressive, Humans next, Dwarves followed, then Gnomes.
---
I would emote /calm alliance or wave, still attacked.
---
Sad times
---
Part of rule 2 "This includes attacks against other communities.Our neighboring sub, r/WoW is like a sibling. We may not always agree with them but at the end of the day we still love them. We want to build a bridge between the two communities to share our love for the same core game."
---
I know people that've been banned for camping rooftops and whatnot in arathi basin etc, its applicable.
---
Enh is the best levelling spec. There would be no gear overlap that way too so that helps.
---
Singleplayer loot simulator with online grouped content elements.
---
They couldn't even get the ent druid model right.  :,(
---
Snowbite, a whitehaired female nelf, spent many many years tanking ...
---
I played horde we didn’t run deadmines, DM was DireMaul.
---
Bookmarked for launch
---
I disagree.  If Classic does well, I think it's quite possible that we could get mini expansions like this.  After all, this is a business - and if there's profit in adding content to Classic, they'll do it.
---
Well, he has a point.
---
Leatherworking is really only useful for some pre raid gearing and onyxia scale cloak.
---
Blacksmithing has two items for armorsmiths, which are wanted by every dps warrior and axesmithing has nightfall. Apart from that, there really only is sulfuron hammer.
---
Tailoring has a good pre raid bop item and apart from that, there's bags.
---
Alchemy is the most replaceable profession in the game. You can full well make a lvl 35 alt and max alchemy on them. You'll be a fully functional alchemist capable of making anything but flasks and the biggest mana pots. And for those, you can ask the guild alchemist.
---
Enchanting rests on the shoulders of raiders, as most top tier recipes are rare bop drops in raids. Disenchanting can be done with a bank alt, as you don't need any skill in enchanting to disenchant. So, there really is no point having more than 2-3 enchanters in the raid.
---
Then, there is engineering, which provides you with a wide variety of gadgets to help you out and which require engineering skill to use. That's why it's the best profession in vanilla.
---
Yes, every profession has its place, but most of them are very limited in their usefulness for the average player, usually coming down to a single item. There is little reason to have more than 1-2 people in the guild on every profession. Starting in TBC you had specific profession bonuses, e.g. smiths could make extra sockets for two items, enchanters could enchant their rings. This gave every profession something unique, but in vanilla, the only profession, which is truly unique is engineering.
---
If you are the first one getting bs pats from raids, you can make a ton of money with bs.  Sometimes charging 100g for crafting fees for a couple days (until someone else gets it)
---
Yup exactly, they designed the game around people who want instant gratification and stomp their feet the loudest, rather than people that enjoy RPG mechanics and dedicate themselves to the game.
---
What? This patch is already better than any patch we’ve had in the last 3 expansions.
---
According to Kevin Jordan this was designed to work properly. No source, apologies, should ask him on stream if you want.
---
You know that there's like 8 classes? I used to have this problem till I started to try other classes and specs the game offers lol. No class stays King forever
---
So you’re saying we should roll priests??
---
Then play Hunter.
---
Having fun is the most important part.
---
Also as Hunter not to many people share the same gear as you, maybe rouges for leather or enhance shamans for mail.
---
In 5/10 dungeons your personal ability to play and work together with others is more important them min/maxing classes.
---
And in raids there are always a few hunter. Not as many as mages but still 1-3 or something.
---
(as much as I remember could also be more)
---
I only use reddit on my phone, and have nevernused reddit on pc. Ama.
---
Thank you for your help. Everything is a lot more clearer now
---
Ha, in that case then it all sounds good. :)
---
Tauren ele shaman vs orc warlock, for experiencing pve but focusing on pvp while minimizing respec costs.
---
this is not going to happen lmao
---
&gt; This sub doesn't know much about how classic is played in 2019.
---
Literally no one does, champ.
---
What about Scarlet Monastery? CB: Chapeau Boss!
---
&gt; I heal on live, but even on live I know holy is pretty dull. Looking at classic healing it really just looks too dull, only casting one or two heals
---
This is different on Classic as you'll downrank, so you have more buttons to press, but still pretty similar.
---
&gt; This is why I’m rethinking mage too, as it’s a literally one button spec then a two button spec later on.
---
For PvE, yes. For PvP mage is one of the classes with the highest skill cap.
---
&gt; As for warlock, limited debuff slots limiting how much of your class you can play worry’s me about getting frustrated.
---
Same as above.
---
Most classes seem pretty lackluster in PvE, but that's a tiny part of what you'll be doing and I wouldn't plan around that entirely.
---
Wasn't that already in vanilla? If not, i'm sure there will be an addon to "fix" that eventually.
---
Yes, people dissing on retail when classic will be just as "retail" as live is. I hate the semantics, you're paying for both so nobody should act like they're above one or the other. You should want them to both to be successful...
---
As a rogue I plan on stealthing around DM catching people. 
---
Solo you can still try to run around and kill people, that's all it really is. Get a unique spot with lots of people that want to do dungeons/level/ or whatever and grind grind grind.
---
"Hey guys, look at all the DPS I did!"
---
You realize streamers only make money if people watch their videos, right? They are invested in being hyped or disappointed because being moderate doesn’t attract clickthroughs.
---
Play the patch and make up your own mind. I have no opinion beyond a pretty mild opinion of the patch notes because I haven’t logged in to the new content yet....leveling up a lowbie priest atm.
---
Hey there!
---
I accepted, send me a shout :)
---
WOW, thank you. I will read that guide ASAP
---
Well... but what about.. and...
---
You are right. I'm fine with this change.
---
Some servers have longevity. For example, the WotLK server I played on has been around for quite some time. At least 6 years. There is also another pretty popular and has been around for a while.
---
But if Blizzard came out with WotLK Classic, I would leave my in a heartbeat. First of all, I would be playing on about 40-70 ping instead of 200. Second of all, the population would be healthier than the private server. Third of all, it would be better scripted and 10x more accurate than any private server could.
---
I'd imagine the same reasoning would apply to any private server for Vanilla.
---
Ummmm Auto-Loot option is already in the interface menu.
---
With leeway you will be able to wing clip your dead zone by strafing. Leeway will make Hunter tolerable
---
See that’s my worry. From what I’ve seen online hunter will be a pretty popular class and I’m concerned ab having only 1-3 per raid, I don’t have too much experience with classic raiding and I’m afraid I won’t be able to find a guild that needs a hunter lol
---
EU server concern is hilarious to me. We’ve had Chinese and south/Central Americans playing on NA servers or grouped with NA servers since vanilla and we got by. Anyone play on Illidan back in the day, like 15-20% of the server was Chinese and didn’t speak any English at all.
---
Both cool.
---
Both viable.
---
Engineering will give you in the end of the day more thread generation and is also cool for PvP 
---
Blacksmith will give to the early gear and much beaded resti gear, but will loose its usefulness in later phases.
---
Some really good ideas here. My guild will be doing something very similar, only minus the wish lists and with slightly different criteria (attendance, loot history, relative upgrade). I think that going above and beyond to be transparent with the loot council's decision-making will go a long way towards building trust in the system.
---
Haha, glad you saw that yourself.
---
Im not sure if it's the way you worded yourself or if you really do believe that this guy is responsible for breaking up the relationship. But its really mostly her fault alone. I agree that it is absolutely scummy of him to hit on her while she is in a relationship. But if thats all it took to break it up, it wasn't much of a relationship anyway.
---
The vanilla spawn point is not guessing around, it's confirmed it was that way. Only one could spawn in each zone and the CD I can't quite remember if it was 4 hours or 8 hours.
---
There's tons of lotuses on private servers, I farm them for gold in Silithus and at best I've found 3 in roughly 20 minutes.
---
What you're saying makes no sense. : ) Of course it is subjective, how your argument isn't? The very fact you like something or you don't is subjective. You don't like neither leeway nor batching and want them gone, how is this not subjective? You don't like the fact two people can cc one another meaning neither casted spell faster despite this being pretty much physically impossible - how is this not subjective?
---
It's all about your subjective opinion and experience, bruh. I just remember batching being ridiculous and bonkers more often than not and actually adding some crazy and quirky interactions to the game. I wouldn't like it gone because it's one of those things that made original WoW fun. I know it was made to counter lag just the same way as leeway did but reason behind leeway was that the enemy could actually be much further away from you than you actually saw him on your display due to lag between you and the server which shouldn't be the case anymore and it makes the game *less* immersive if anything. In contrast, I remember I often cancelled my own spells via moving to already start casting next spell faster because I knew it would be cast anyway (I played a healer). Batching literally was heavily incorporated into original WoW's mechanic and that bit is not subjective - the fact that I cannot imagine Classic with batching gone definitely is subjective, though.
---
Please, not the last one ! Do more ! :D  
---
Maybe map of your custom dungeons/raid ?
---
My first was undead mage, too and when recreating my char recently, I found, I just hate all the bones sticking out now. When I was younger I thought it was awesome. Going troll this time, mon! Trading bones for no shoes! The mage will alt next to hunter main.
---
If you define meta class like mage, rogue and warrior, it's not everyone who likes to play those classes. I always play hybrid classes because they are not linear like the meta classes.
---
Just because you are in a beta can report bugs doesn't mean you can't have a little fun with them or even be angry that they exist.
---
Not even the point of the screenshot...
---
no he doesn't.
---
And whats about the maps of your raids/dungrons like the scarlet crusader raid ?
---
My favorite was there was a way to get into the non instanced version of ZG if you ran up the hills south of the entrance
---
Classic made me quit many games I used to play. Now I play only a few while patiently waiting for it to launch.
---
This thread is so 2017.
---
I always wondered why it's so complicated to do for blizzard when a handful of motivated people managed to do it on their own without much access to the original.
---
That's the kind of answers i want from reddit
---
I hated soul lock warlocks, rank 14 warriors, and bis elemental shamans.
---
If people made groups with the understanding that "Im the only one allowed to get this item" then nobody would ever agree to go with them.  It's why this was never a thing.  I played Wow Vanilla from american beta to eu beta to launch to the end of vanilla.  Every day.  And I never saw a group accept this.
---
What I DID see happen, was people create groups so they wouldn't have to roll.  For example, a clothie would make sure he was the only cloth member in the group to be sure if it dropped, it was his.
---
But this "reserve" thing?  It's for the birds.  I certainly would never group with somebody with this attitude.
---
Silver hand release was a good reminder of that.
---
Suggest invite and request to join are built in together.
---
They say that people OD on heroin because they are chasing the feeling they got on that first hit.
---
WoW has evolved down the same road as a heroin addiction.  You're not hitting it to feel good anymore - you're hitting it because if you don't, you feel bad - like, you're logging in to raid because you feel like you *should*, not because you want to.
---
Classic is an opportunity to take that first hit again.  You'll feel almost as good as the first time you played it.  People are gonna take that hit and they're gonna get hooked - to classic - again.  People are gonna play what their friends play.
---
So how does that ruin the economy then? You're talking about 80% of the community making 50-100 gold per hour. That sounds like a very healthy economy to me where everyone can put in time and make steady money.
---
What am I missing?
---
if possible then yes, the more firm the knowledge the better we can theorize ^^
---
thank you again :)
---
Round robin is the only way.
---
Yes by opening a ticket. Should be used mostly for gold sellers IMO.
---
600 days I lost interest about any other game then Classic.
---
Yep
---
Really bad to edit someone else artwork without permission. Even more when you make it look worse than the original by a lot. All the subtleness of the details and soft transitions between light and dark is lost. Really bad taste and bad attitude. 
---
This thread should be downvoted and the artist notified.
---
Haha. Newcomer
---
Your comparison does not at all hold and actually distracts from the point you were failing to make.
---
Awwww bruhhhhhhhh. On the other hand. When it's just you and someone else rolling on something. You roll an 18 and absolutely cringe. The other guy rolls a 2. Pure ecstasy haha.
---
We can't stop here! 
---
This is bat country !
---
It was the best profession for me while leveling a warrior. You’re gonna need those health pots and the buffs are really helpful too. I won’t pretend to be a warrior leveling expert, have only done it twice, but when I do it again in classic alchemy gets the biggest yes from me.
---
I’ve been leveling up an orc warlock on a pserver after playing a gnome rogue in classic. 
---
I think I made the decision yesterday to do a gnome warlock in classic. I just like the look of the gnomes and it seems to fit a warlock well. Small little demon man. 
---
Orc definitely has the pvp advantage I think, but you have to like how the player looks.
---
This is an extremely specific case but my second character was a NE hunter. I got deep into pvp at WSG at level 19 and pretty much all the way to 60. There was a troll rogue that seemed to mirror my progression and she was insanely good at pvp. 
---
We had a ton of epic fights at WSG and we both made burner characters on alliance/horde to compliment each other on our matches. 
---
Once we both hit 60, we randomly ran into each other in a pvp zone. I forget which one but we met face to face, waved and bowed and then wound up dueling a few times. She won almost every one.
---
We agreed to fight anytime we saw each other and went on to have a ton of crazy fights in AV. So to answer your question, troll rogues still scare the shit out of me because every time I saw one I thought it was my nemesis.
---
What level of pve do you want to reach? Ele will have a more difficult time finding a spot in a raid.
---
As for respeccing, lock pve and pvp builds are very different, while pve ele will likely be fine in pvp. 
---
A little more detail on your priority between pve/pvp, what level of pve you want to reach and how seriously you plan to raid, would be helpful in really narrowing it down.
---
We're talking about Vanilla. Enhancement actually gets -30% threat to its melee attacks in BC. If enhancement ACTUALLY had the ability to pull aggro consistently in vanilla like you're saying we'd see a lot more of them. Because it'd mean their dps was actually good. "Spiking your threat" with windfury doesn't really matter if you're doing 300 dps. You aren't gonna go over the warrior doing 900 dps on KTM because you procced WF twice in a row. And if you did, it's because you made the conscious decision to start DPS knowing it could happen. Because it literally could only happen in the first 20 seconds or so of a fight.  You're very much inflating a rare occurrence into something that happens all the time.
---
My argument is objective.
---
It's an objective fact that one person pressed the button first. It's an objective fact that one is more accurate than the other. It's objective that a competition between two people is fairer if you are more accurate. Nothing about anything I said was subjective.
---
Why shouldn't harmstring work? Melee leeway shouldn't be that bad.
---
There is WPvP in BFA?
---
Tbh av sucked in vanilla regardless of the patch. Not that big of a deal
---
Gnome Rogue
---
using world enlarger + noggenfogger... painfully small and even able to get under obstacles impossible for other races.

I feel this in my bones. 60 days to choose pally priest or shaman. Troll vs Human vs Undead. FUCK
---
No it doesn't.
---
See, I can make comments with no substance to them too.

It happened to me on WotLK Naxx, I rolled 22 on some shoulders, and the other two guys rolled 20 and 17 😅
---
DM = Dire Maul
---
VC = Deadmines
---
DM is also deadmines if you shift click someone that's "LFG DM" and they're level 16.
---
As far as I know you can't.
---
Take rogue vs. rogue for example, you have to blind at the same time as they gouge, because you expected it to happen.
---
I think you just heavily misunderstand how it works, you can't blind while you're gouged.
---
I've always known it as:
---
DM:N, DM:E, DM;W or DM Tribute and then DM for Deadmines.
---
Typically not playing cloth wearers, and having friends who play clothwearers, I've fashioned calling Cath "LetsgogetyouyourM.Bisonhat".
---
Do you think you’ll get burnt out before classic launches? I played the stress test and have been playing on and off P servers the past two months. I’m trying to stop because I feel like I’ll be burnt out for classic but I keep coming back for more
---
How long did you see him doing it in, 1 hour 10 mins?
---
anything that doesn’t wear cloth or plate. Leather wearer would be ideal.
---
Considering it takes almost 5 days of /played time to even reach level 60....

No. A 'ton' of guilds will not even look inside MC by week 2.
---
I can’t remember if trials could /who or not
---
What do you play that makes them insignificant?
---
haha nice, casting hearhstone ;D
---
Friendly reminder that none of this matters because the winning team will either be a premade or have more healers
---
&gt;You don't need to "predict" someone is going to charge you, you need to press blind within up to a full fucking fifth of a second after they have   
---
&gt;already  
---
&gt; charged you. 
---
I'm pretty sure that's not how the batching works. If they are already charging you, you are stunned which means you cannot use any abilities. The batching is collecting inputs and executing their respective abilities in the same batch. If a warrior is charging you, then that ability has already been executed, which means that you are not in the same batch. That's why you need to predict it. You can't just wait for the charge to go off and then blind right after, you need to both have input your ability in the same batch.   
---
I just tested this and there's no way I could react to the warrior's charge and cast any abilities as soon as I saw the charge.
---
Even if it was possible, reacting to a 200ms window is also a skill in itself.
---
You don't pick. You do one, level to around 28 and get  bored in stonetalon mountains and then start over next week.
---
You do this for a year re-leveling the same classes before picking a hunter and finally get to 60
---
Bingo.
---
I too played assassin's creed odyssey
---
Aye, that's the shit thing, seeing an undead spriest is going to cause any alliance member to either get away or engage first, which results in the 1 in a 100 friendly undead Spriest getting attacked when they don't wanna fight.
---
Lots of it honestly.
---
wasnt it priest cos smite is such a high damage spell early on?
---
Night elf is unquestionably better due to not having a huge unwieldy character model that can only ride one other mount than their own awful one and looks shit in armour.
---
Explain that to the VC heritics. Also, 99% of all Deadmines groups are formed in Westfall general chat or directly in guild chat or voice comms.
---
Inflation, people who can’t do it will be screwed,
---
For me its fine i prefer if its stay in his original form, but i can also understand ppl who want it to be changed
---
Anyway lets wait and see how blizzard will handle it
---
Crushbone is from EQ
---
I have the feeling the people left on pservers are going to largely be the under 18 crowd.
---
Would you say that seems accurate?
---
For reals?  Even with war mode on people tend to ignore me
---
Thinking about and writing down what my requirements actually are might help me to figure out what class should be most suitable for me.
---
Right now my problem is that one class fullfills some of my requirements but not the others and vice-versa. I guess I need to add a weighing for the importance to my requirements, as not everyone of my requirements are equally important to me. Then I shall calculate a score for all of the classes based on the values.
---
1. The class should have an easy time finding dungeon-groups. (weight: 2)
---
2. The class' available races should fit my race preference. (weight 3)
---
Gnome: 9, Nightelf: 8, Undead: 7, Human: 6, Troll: 5, Tauren: 4, Orc: 3, Dwarf: 2
---
3. The class should excel at the primary group-role I'd play them for: (weight: 3)
---
4. The class should be usefull in PvP without having to rely on others: (weight: 2)
---
5. The class should be self-sufficient and strong in PvE when alone: (weight: 1)
---
6. The class should be rich in playstyle-variety (weight: 3)
---
7. The class should not have to spend a lot of bagspace for class-specific purposes (weight: 1)
---
8. The class should look good while fighting (weight: 1)
---
Now if you could fill in each class in the order they fulfill these requiements, I would give a score of 9 for the highest and 1 for the lowest, multiply that with the weight, add everything up and should thus find what class best fits my criteria.
---
I have already filled it for my race-preference.
---
Here's an example of what the result would look like based on my own assumptions for the example of a druid:
---
I think finding dungeon-groups as a druid might be the easiest of all classes as I can tank or heal or dps. So 9 * 2 = 18 points for that.
---
Druid is available to Nightelf, which are my 2nd favorite race, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 points for that.
---
With a druid I'd want to primarily heal. Unfortunately without an ooc-rezz and no real option to do something like wanding inbetween I feel it's behind the other healers in that regard, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 points here.
---
I think druids are awesome in PvP, maybe the best healer due to their mobility and have a rich toolkit for various tasks. But they have a hard time actually killing someone. I feel I'd rather be a hunter, warlock or mage over a druid in PvP, so 6 * 2 = 12 points.
---
I think it's pretty similar here as with the last category. Hunters, Warlocks and Mages are probably better at solo-Pve... but since it's not so important to me, that's 6 points.
---
Druid-playstyle should be the most varied of all the classes. So that's a clear 9 * 3 = 27 points here!
---
But this comes at the price of having to carry around a lot of different gear for different purposes, which wastes a lot of bagspace. I'd say Mages, Priests, Warriors, Shamans, Rogues and Paladins all have it better in that regard. So 3 points here.
---
The last category really only affects druids. Having to turn into a bear or a cat, on whom you see nothing of your gear is a big disadvantage for this class. So only 1 point for that.
---
If I added up correctly that's 109 points in total for the druid... according to my own assumptions. Now I just need to repeat the process for all the classes.
---
I won the Swift Razzashi Raptor on a roll of 60-something. I almost cried when I rolled. Was one of the best moments in WoW for me.
---
Exactly transparency is huge and helps to instill a lot of confidence into the raiders especially when they see when they are getting an upgrade.
---
The window is literally 200ms. It doesn't need to be at the same moment, thats what "window" means in this context.
---
I'm arguing for making the window as small as possible like it is on live, and thus more accurate.
---
Needs a [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa9n7GirhsI)
---
Yeahhh I dunno if I believe that. More likely they were banned for some verbal harassment type shit
---
I did the mage tower with every spec.  Retail simply took a turn in the wrong direction from legion.  
---
When you have a character with maxed reps through each expansion and then have your already gutted spec cut down even more the game is no longer enjoyable.
---
I don't know that they would host BC servers as well as Classic+. I feel like it would be fracturing the player base too much, as well as the amount of Devs would need to be increased dramatically. Look at how much work it's taken to get classic going, I doubt that blizzard would allocate enough resources to simultaneously the get ClassicBC and classic + going at the same time while also having retail as well.
---
Because...
---
DAE RETAIL BAD CLASSIC WILL BE GOOD XD 
---
Classic will be good until the majority of the casual playerbase will cry it takes so long to level, will dick-measure themselves against better players, they will get molested in PvP with no chance to fight back against broken specs and cry they cant get into PUG raids on their boomkin druid. 
---
Classic is going to be great, no doubt about it - especially for those who know what they're getting into.
---
Here's hoping the development of classic  post Naxx comes sooner rather than later.
---
Hes a complete dweeb.  His nerd game is on a level higher than mine and I'm mapping out a wow/darksouls tattoo.

---
Let's try and keep that authentic vanilla experience.
---
&gt;You're not "countering" the CC if it already happened. You're just artificially denying it.
---
People will be aware of the quirks introduced by batching and then playing around it, as it applies to everyone I don't really feel like it's artificial in most cases. The person relying solely on hitting their buttons first is just playing wrong in this case.
---
&gt;That's the point. If you like that then fine, I can't tell you what to like, but I can say it's objectively inaccurate.
---
Personally I think the current window is too large, but I wouldn't remove it entirely. Though even if it was removed I'm going to be playing as a shaman which only really benefits from no batching (outside of grounding shenanigans) as it means there's less counterplay for warstomp and shock/ground will be easier to land.
---
They've proven themselves lazy and inept multiple times.
---
The new zones?
---
If you are in war mode, there will be wpvp. Especially since the new zones are a huge bottleneck for the entire level 120 playerbase now. 
---
There even was some kind of PVP event happening I didn't understand.
---
I mean... I imagine the main deciding factor is if you want to be horde or alliance.
---
My ping in TBC and Vanilla was 100-150 usually, now I have 15-30.
---
Both playing on EU servers of course.
---
If he can get ahead of the pack he will save WAY more than that.
---
It is how it works. If I charge you, you could have up to 200ms to react to that charge so that they resolve simultaneously.
---
In order for what you are saying to be true, there would be no window at all. No batches at all. You can't both have a window where you can both have a skill and have it so that something has executed and you can't react.
---
With the new patch being fresh most people avoid conflict but I still got into a few tussles yesterday in Naz while questing. 
---
They added a few pvp options in naz that increases pvp as well. Points to for alliance and horde to fight over and what not.
---
Kudos is king and cowpeople look great in caster gear....those shoulders....nelf has a slight advantage in cat form but Tauren have advantage in all forms
---
Nobody wants this, not even the most hardcore no changes people want leeway.
---
But they do have phones!
---
MT/GM was living with a fat, ugly single mother in her late 20s (baby not MT's).
---
19 year old guy drops out of college and moves across country to move in with fat ugly single mother.  Fat ugly single mother kicks MT/GM out of house.  MT/GM disbands guild and quits game.
---
Not similar at all to vanilla, which is why they thankfully won't be doing it.
---
I've never played Runescape but from the footage I've seen, is WoW not more intricate and complex a world than Runescape? I wonder if people are just saying it would be groundbreaking in scale and scope rather than just idea.
---
Sit don’t proc enrage or any abilitie (except some spell batching sheaningans) so arms with anger management, and tactical mastery and then later sweeping strike, is probably the way to go
---
Guess you missed the massive hype around CoreCraft that went on for years?
---
It is similar to vanilla. The spell batching was 200ms in vanilla because of servers at the time. They are doing it too.
---
I don’t plan to be a very serious raider, I’d moreso just like to see as much as possible (never raided in vanilla, except that time I got invited to ZG and we stood around for an hour before disbanding without killing even a trash mob). I guess my goal would be a t2 set cause they are so sexy. I like the ele option because I hear you can sneak by as a healer for raids by being put in melee groups, but I also like warlock because I heard the sm/ruin build can be equally as versatile between pve and pvp with some minor tweaks. The main drawback for shaman is that I want to be a dps (support, utility, whatever... just not a pocket healer I guess)
---
You can downvote this as much as you want.
---
It won't change the reality that 8.2 is a big letdown.
---
Oh, and you can call me names as much as you want. I understand the frustration, and if you think that calling me names will improve 8.2 and Retail...have at it.
---
did lifesteal work with spell power back then ?
---
Just resub bud.
---
Tauren Druid is king
---
Ok how about a challenge then. Private servers have the same batching system of 200ms, how about we go on one and I'll charge you, and you have to react and cast an ability as I'm charging you? If you can do that lets say 5 times in a row, I'll concede my point and admit that I'm wrong.
---
vurtne? fucking lmao

Pah, in EQ you'd have lost XP and be running back naked!

Hope you get it again when classic rolls out 😁
---
 &gt; I'm arguing for making the window as small as possible like it is on live, and thus more accurate.
---
This is what I was talking about.
---
This is so true. I tried 8.2.... I was bored within 2 hours.. Not only am I bored with every game out right now. My life is so boring right now Classic is the only thing i'm looking forward to. I'm taking the whole week off for it.
---
I was considering trying 8.2 out until I saw that flying is back, I hate it.
---
The fact I can charge you at the same moment you charge me every single time we duel would be evidence of that alone.

Dear bootso,

I'm regretfully writing you, to address a mistake I have made in my last comment.

I've got my class race narrowed down to troll priest on a wpvp server. One of my goals this time around is to be more profitable, since I didn't get my first gold til 30 when I first played...😅

I've heard skinning/herbalism is good for leveling, but I've also heard tailoring/alchemy or tailoring/enchanting is good as well.  What are everyone's thoughts?

Well...maybe my paranoia is based on retail players actual complaints ?

Star Wars Battlefront 2 with friends. But the game is full of bugs lately. So most matches are a shit show. But still fun to play with friends. Been playing it for a year and a half and still not burnt out. Same with pservers. Can’t get enough of that either.
---
Yeah, and why wouldn't you want more accuracy?
---
It's also restrictions that make the game worse, oh you can't kite bosses to cities, you can't destroy a town etc.
---
That's not multi-boxing but people should be allowed to play the game however they want if it doesn't give them an unfair advantage. Multi-boxing doesn't. Sure the coordination of 5 characters played by 1 person will be slightly better but 5 people with 5 different characters will easily beat a multi-boxer in a 5v5.
---
I know people did use multi-boxing in TBC and Wrath to get to relatively high arena rating but they were never the best teams only a couple of really really high skilled people could manage to do it. 
---
If you don't want to multi-box, then don't. I won't do it either, but why should we want to take away the gameplay experience of others?
---
It's like saying hey I hate battlegrounds and pvp, battlegrounds and pvp rewards should be removed from the game or hey I hate raiding, there should be no raids in the game.
---
I'm not the guy you responded to but I just started playing on a pserver last night. I'm not too worried about burn out because I'm not playing it as hard as I would the Classic release. Not putting in the hours I would normally; just taking it slow and enjoying having something to play. Too excited for Classic to enjoy other games for more than an hour right now haha.
---
Hamstring kiting should be fixed before launch, and that means arms 1-60 is best.
---
Then you accept the challenge? You go on a warlock and I'll charge you. Your objective is to cast for example curse of agony as soon as you see me charging. Do that 5 times in a row and we can settle it.
---
I'm playing on a pserver here and there, but no real investment at all. Mostly just to get somewhat acclimated to classic for low levels, relearning movement and skills, etc. Otherwise I'm playing Bloodstained quite a bit, Pathfinder Kingmaker still, Pillars of Eternity 2, Immortal Redneck(great for streams), and other stuff. Plenty to do here.
---
If you knew how clueless you are then you would be laughing too my friend
---
Fixed as in it won't or will be viable?
---
I used to watch a guy on YouTube called T2Darlantan
---
There’s absolutely no need for you to apologize to that guy.
---
Fixed in as it will be working and will be viable.
---
Settling on a class has been brutal for me. First I thought I was settled on Ele/Resto Shaman until my friend group decided on Alliance. Then I considered going back to my roots with SPriest, but I’m concerned with respec costs and 1 SPriest per raid. Then figured I’d go Hunter and really thought I had decided on that until the pet micro and falling off in progression scared me away. Now I’m kind of between Warlock and Mage. Still concerned about pet micro with Warlock but think it won’t be as involved as Hunter. Also concerned about farming soul shards and how much of a pain that is. Last leaves Mage which I guess now that I think about it not much has scared me away yet. I don’t love having to play a clothie because of how much priest I’ve played on retail, and I guess spamming frostbolt doesn’t sound too fun either.
---
What do? This has been a rough decision... back to watching class guides to try and figure this out.
---
Rust &amp; Pserv 1.12.1 Naxx
---
You could yes, the 3 sec debuff was not part of Vanilla I know that, but what I said is true, Ice Block does drop the flag.
---
&gt;  oh and you'll take less damage because of the "defense" you get from stacking strength too.
---
I think you typo'd here and meant agility.
---
Yeah friend, it’s not like there is tons of video evidence supporting my claim
---
You made me chuckle a bit, thanks.
---
Retail can't be fixed in a patch, nor could it probably be fixed with the current decision makers behind it. From my PoV I can only see three outcomes of current retail: 
---
1. They're trying to reverse some of the mistakes, and aiming for making retail more popular again. This might take at least 1,5 - 2 expansion with GOOD decisions in order to get it more enjoyable.
---
2. They continue down the path they're at with small adjustment, but the basic idea with hand-holding and quick access gameplay is still the core of every decision. If that happends I think Activision Blizzard will eventually just pull the plug on further developing of content.
---
3. Classic gets more popular than intended, and not only the first month but long-term. This might lead to some dramatical changes down the line. Either with next expansion on retail getting a huge revamp in terms of core ideas getting changed (anti-prune, anti-lfr, anti-sharding and anti-hand holding). This might be huge for next expansion, but it would still probably need some tuning before its decent. 
---
So, with a positive mindset you're looking at 3 - 6 years before retail is actually fun again. But having classic and possibly TBC in 2 years might be a more realistic source for long-term fun!
---
As horde when u start in durotar take the shaman totem path, jump in water then swim to ratchet and Xroad, both flypath that will be usefull in less than 10minute, then hearth Back and continue leveling normaly
---
for a sec I thought both of you were hardcore junkeys. Then I looked at the image again
---
i dont think it hurts because literally nobody is going to call classic retail, which as you know, is simply the name given to the current version of the game.
---
I mean, the other good thing was HUGE strides toward spec balance. Specs that had zero place in Vanilla actually could exist in TBC. That is basically the number one thing it had over Vanilla even behind the raids IMO.
---
Can you give me a source the spell batching was 200ms in vanilla?
---
If that's the case, they clearly messed it up and it should be done properly.
---
I just recently started in BfA. I went from doing WQ between the two continents to now doing WQ underwater.
---
I have a Legion Follower 2.0 that I can level up by doing daily WQs. Some manapearls that don't really do much for me except make me run faster while doing WQs or fleeing mobs. And as a tank, the new Heart Forge stuff isn't anything to write home about.
---
I guess I'm missing something crucial to unlock fun :\[
---
Mmmm, layering
---
You played in a private server with fake armor and parry values it’s not the same thing as real classic. With bosses taking that much less damage and having harder NPCs it would only take a group of 5 to fuck up a less organized AV. Your private server experience has absolutely nothing close to what real classic was. Yea if both sides parley and agree that it will be a straight shot into the enemy commander I’m sure it’s fast, but in real wow it didn’t fly like this ever in original AV.
---
Thanks a bunch, I had no idea it was so strong!
---
The leeway can be updated on your average ping in the last 5 minutes, so fast changes would have no effect.

I plan to play arms warrior with a few points in protection so I can tank dungeons and maybe off tank a few raids and in the same time have some fun in pvp.
---
What I am not sure about is what profession to get. As most probably I am going to play a tauren, herbalism seems like a good choice and I can make the materials needed for the good blacksmithing items. Also from what I have researched it is a good profession for making money. What do you think? Is herbalism a good choice for a warrior?
---
After playing on the beta as a warlock i can tell you that no one plays like that anymore. The people he is killing are total noobs.

I've been avoiding private servers to avoid getting burnt out.  I can't find any good games to play though.

I've been following this on the most recent LH pserver launch and it's wonderful.   LvL 20 in around 14 hours played..that includes a deadmines run too.  I'm going to be following Hakurai's guide at launch.
---
&gt; how do we know blizz will remove it as they said?
---
This is a ridiculous argument and makes it impossible to discuss anything.
---
We don't know that. But that's the information we have right now, so that's what we have to base arguments/feelings/whatever on.
---
How do we know they won't remove it the second day of launch? How do we know Blizzard won't just decide to pull the plug on Classic? How do we know we're going to wake up alive in the morning?
---
i believe /sit macro was a private server thing and came in tbc ....
---
I'm pretty sure that I'll play a rogue and an alt-mage, but I'm trying to figure out 2 things:
---
1. I know engineering is very important for PvP and PvE aswell, but I don't really like it tbh. So the question is: how important is it for a Rogue in PvE? Are we talking about a 10%+ increase DPS or much less? I was thinking about going herbalism/alchemy, but I don't want to impair myself.
---
2. In end game, for a PvE rogue, should I go swords or daggers? If swords, I think humans are probably the best, otherwise I'd roll an elf or a dwarf I guess.
---

---
if leeway stays, RIP hunter, Tauren hunters will be 1/100000 and the most terrifying thing to see will be a Tauren Warrior coming towards you, by the time you turn to flee he already melee you from outside the frost nova range.
---
But it's all good, because the blind #nochange players will light their torches (by rubbing 2 pieces of wood together .. ofcourse) raise their pitchforks and come storm the blizz HQ for not using the time-machine.
---
To be honest, i would have wanted a modern version of Classic: no batch, no leeway, no debuff slot limit (this would have been fun to alteast test in the beta), and even with the modern graphics and textures of retail wow (maybe with the option to have it like classic via a HD texture pack on/off switch)
---
Holy shit. My first character in vanilla was a rogue named venetherouge lmao
---
Deviate :)
---
If that was now he would be dead in seconds. Healer didnt heal and the rogue didnt even kick, stun or use poisons.

You guys pushed phases? My experience was as a rogue i never won onyxia parses in private servers when we chilled in first phase and pushed air phase

Do you also wash your hands without your sleeves rolled up?

Did BlIzZaRd even want retail to ever be successful tho with their Asian so grind your life away shit tho? Lol. I play bns casually and won't once classic is out but my god how dumbed down and grindey could they make this crap if I wanted that I would play an ASIAN mmo

There were quiet a few actually.  FFXI, Runescape, Ultima, Dark age of Camelot to name a few.  Even the causal cartoonish Ragnarok had rough exp loss.

Read the blue post. It's clear as day. "**Mages can RELIABLY polymorph one another.**"
---
Without a window, that's not reliable, because whoever pressed first wins, not both going off for arbitrary reasons even though one reacted later.
---
Look at mr big shot over here
---
1. Then it won't actually help with sudden lag, which it is supposed to combat. So why leave it in then?
---
2. It's still very much open to abuse. I might turn up the latency when playing a melee class for the maximum melee range. And I might turn it down when playing on a mage, and I want the fastest possible response times.
---
It's weird how you say "it's a tough call" after listing like 5 advantages for nightelf and only 1 for tauren. :o

Nothing on the mmo front, I'm staying away from private servers to avoid burnout. I'm playing through the campaign for Warcraft 3, and I highly recommend it. It's a great RTS and really builds the hype for WoW and gives you a solid lore background. 
---
Otherwise, GOG has Warcraft &amp; Warcraft II for $15! The first one didn't age well, but the nostalgia is great. It was the first RTS game I ever played and endeared me to Blizzard. WC 2 is still good solid fun and there's still a large online community. 
---
ARPGs are a favorite of mine and Diablo 2 and 3 are great options from Blizzard. Grim Dawn and Path of Exile are also great and harken back to Diablo 2.
---
^^^^*But, I understand for some of you, your favorite flavor is...*

Only 60 days guys.

8.2 is one the best patches we've had in years. Why are you talking like it's a flop? It's been out for a day and so far the general consensus is positive. 
---
No one seriously expected BFA to be fixed overnight with this patch, but 8.2 is a HUGE step in the right direction. 
---
-Upgradable armor vendors giving us agency over how we gear up
---
-World PvP events in the new zone witb incentive to participate
---
-More in depth system added to azerite mechanic that gives new on use and passive abilities 
---
-Mount equipment is pretty cool
---
-Customizable mechagon trinket that lets you pick your stats
---
-Customizable mounts and cosmetics on Mechagon
---
-Minimized time gated mechanics on Najzatar and Mechagon
---
Yes there is a lot more that needs to be addressed but 8.2 is by no means a disappointment. At least to the people who have been invested in BFA since the beginning.
---
US had a lot of dial-up in vanilla. Majority of people were above 100ms.
---
So it's perfect?
---
Then why are you complaining?

Hey there! I've been considering druid and I have quite a few questions. Was hoping to start a dialogue with someone who feels they are knowledgable on the subject.
---
I understand that while I can fill any roll to an extent, I dont necessarily excel at any of them. Restoration is the typical raid spec. That being said what does that look like? Is it more single target, aoe, HoT? When compared to other classes where should I expect to see myself on the healing meter? When I'm not healing what do my other jobs entail. I know intervate is a big consideration when taking a druid to a raid.
---
In PvP what are my options? Besides flag carrying the consensus seems pretty mixed. Am I relegated to simply that or is there certain damage niches I could potentially fill?
---
What's the difficulty level of the class in pve and pvp respectively? I know it's a strong leveler and I'm pretty sure it's going to be less popular than most if not all other classes classes. Those are attractive to me.  I guess a good question to sum up this comment would be what do people appreciate about a druid player? In pvp what do other people hate when facing one? 
---
I honestly have a ton more questions but I guess this is the bulk of it. Thanks for any help I recieve! 
---
Also.. for the Alliance!! :)
---
Is it worth playing it for the lore before classic?
---
Mostly BFA and random single player RPG games.
---
I’m starting to get that “urge”. It’s like a dog to a bone. Get out of my way and let me play or I will go right through you!
---
I've never heard of skipping "flight masters".  If you don't go to a zone, don't get the FP I guess?  Idk.  This seems like a silly question.  
---
The only real tricks for traveling around are the death in Wetlands to get to Dun Morogh and vice versa.  The other is the trick mentioned already.  You jump off the path for the shaman quest in Durotar to get to ratchet and can immediately fly to Orgrimmar from there.  That saves time for bank alts.
---
Honestly don’t remember, I think I just auto attacked Onyxia from the ground and blade flurried the whelps. Seriously doubt we pushed phases since it was a pug!
---
Right video evidence of pre 1.12 vurtne killing brainafk players nice proof mate.
---
Because intentionally making the game respond worse is nonsensical.
---
Would you also like them to throttle loading times of people with an SSD so it takes 2 mins to load into the game like it used to?
---
Do you lift the toilet lid up when peeing?
---
I'm just playing with myself.
---
Yep I wish I avoided them completely. I started on them like 6 months ago and wish I saved that feeling I got when I quested again for classic in a few months
---
And that's the problem I personally have with beta.  Everyone consumed it and quit like retail.  there is never anyone on to do anything with.
---
"Somewhat" reliably lol. That just means that if they happen to press at the same time, it will result in both being polymorphed every time. That is 100% not the same as saying that one mage can react to the other mages polymorph cast, and they will both be polymorphed every time.
---
But are we going to settle this or not? You seem to avoid my challenge, it's such an easy way to settle this. I'm waiting on my warrior right now.
---
on the 6th day god invented print screen but the OP is a rebel
---
Always pick the race you enjoy lore/visual wise over any racial advantage.
---
You're going to spend literal DAYS playing this character. Pick on you like looking at for hundreds of hours on end.
---
Are you playing them for long periods like you will potentially for classic? Not a lot can hold my interest lately
---
Another reason Classic is so immersive. If you die the run back is fucking painful. Further adding to the constant fear of death.
---
I died in frost mane hold while leveling and got sent to the Anvilmar GY. Learned my lesson real fucking quick not to over pull those trolls.
---
Thank you for the insight. Care to explain why?
---
Final fantasy X. Want to complete it until fire emblem three houses comss out 26 july, then I have 1 month to complete that :)

---
Thanks for the suggest. Sounds like a good plan. Haven't played alliance since back in retail classic but I vaguely remember that cave you mentioned. Some place filled with spiders if I remember correctly.
---
Yep, you fight them fo so long. Long enough for another ally player to show up. Not worth it
---
Practice warlock routes in the beta. :)
---
I'm so torn between Resto Druid and Holy Priest, I've played priest in Vanilla had a fun time and I know it's a safe bet but kinda want something different.
---
 I'm a real Dungeoneer and I'm wondering maybe private server players can help me with this. Is it viable for druids to heal the lvl 50+ dungeons and I don't mean everyone in raid gear, just starter gear and more importantly are they picked, cause I remember from classic people preferred priests over druids. Currently in retail community druids are respected and I wonder if that's going to last in Classic, the no ress is going to be annoying after a while for players especially in the massive dungeons that Classic has.
---
It also doesn't help that being a priest is almost a guarantee guild/raid spot and will have to see about that with druids, I know they are useful but we don't know how many are going to level them and with how many we are going to compete.
---
any help is appreciated.
---
Thanks for the recommendation! I’ve actually bought WC3 a while ago, I’ll actually give it a go now for the lore :)
---
How so? Do shadow priests get different abilities depending on which race they are?
---
Its in the stress test.
---
While I understand and can relate what you're saying because I've played WoW for 12 years (6 as horde 6 as alliance) and have always picked based on what I like and not racial advantages, for my mains, and for my alts. But in this case I feel like I can or maybe even want to have the advantage.
---
For pvp always go horde it’s just a lot easier not having to deal with the hordes OP racials like will of the forsaken lmao
---
BFA
---
Is the combat similar to wow? Or is it super button mashy? It’s on sale on steam
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=5634
---
not if the melee has FAPs. you'll stay in that melee range and no chance of using ranged and the melee will tear you to shreds
---
I want a class that annihilates everyone in PvP. I don't care about PvE at all, basically anything is viable there for one reason or another.
---
I want a good 1v1 class that will top damage in battlegrounds. 
---
Stuck between mage, rogue and warrior. Leaning towards mage cause 1v1 and because I don't think rogues can "top damage" in something like a turtled AV.
---
Also, mining or herbalism? Skinning will be other profession (while leveling, will swap to engi and something else at 60).
---
Yes and no I’ve been joining a pug MC that steam rolls the place and raid logging is by far my least favorite way to play. But I’m not going to grind gold and work hard on a character that’s not permanent.
---
If you want to "min/max", it'd probably be dwarf.
---
Depends on the mob. If you want to stutter I would do this :  
---
Get on maximum melee range of the mob  
---
Wait for the mob melee attack  
---
Dash out as soon as the mob hit (So I would not get slowed down by him attacking me in the back)  
---
Try 1 Stutter shot -&gt; Repeat until level 6 when you get Concussive Shot (If I am correct?)  
---
Then you do the same but try to throw a Concussive.  
---
To be fair, Using terrain and CS might be the best way to stutter effectively from 1 to 10
---
Yeah heroic strikes and eviscerates I hear for melee. Shadow bolts and frostbolts. Everything else is fine as a one of in raid comp but they’re so weak. But 100% just go for your class fantasy. Dont worry about complexity.
---
Not Shadow Priests, but Priests in general do. Each race gest 2 additional abilities that other races don't get. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWoYD4WwrRc&amp;t=65s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWoYD4WwrRc&amp;t=65s)  \- this video shows just which race gets what.
---
If you enjoy the lore I'd advice Warcraft books or youtube videos about it. Nobbel87 is very good imo. The story of Defias Brotherhood is pretty good to start.
---
" but I can't say I like either gender's animations, and how they look in general "
---
You just answered your own question imo. If you choose Dwarf, you're stuck with it. You can still be highly effective regardless of Racial abilities. Pairing up the "right" racials is really just something for extreme optimization. Back in my vanilla days, I was a nasty, nasty Tauren Hunter(bad ability pairing). Orc and Troll are clearly a better choice, but gd they're effing ugly as sh\*t to me. I absolutely fell in love with Tauren, and stopped caring. Although if Undead was a choice for hunters, I may have chosen that. It's all about playing your class right, and regardless there will always be soft and hard counters that exist and that you will inevitably encounter.
---
Also, WotF will help against Warlocks, Priests, and Warriors in case you have worries of Fear.
---

Sounds like you're just used to retail and want to push that shit to classic, which no one wants except people like you who will play it for two weeks.
---
It was there in vanilla, and it will be there in classic. 
---
Deal with it.
---
I have been passingly time counting layering topics here and on other forums.
---
It is so FUCKING EASY.
---
DM = Dead mines
---
DM:E = Dire Maul East
---
DM:W = Dire Maul West
---
DMT: = Dire Maul Tribute (Alternatively DM:N for North).
---
don’t use this
---
Even human paladins can cleanse so easily you’d have to be really bad to let a hunter mana drain you. Honestly with cleanse and Blessing of freedom, hunters should be the least of your worries. From what I remember Druids were the worst, then maybe Shamans.
---
Favorite day of my work week. Rest of week will be spent listening while driving.
---
Dire Maul got 3 wings. Thus, you cannot abbriviate it with just "DM". Totally unintuitive.
---
It depends on the day. Minimum 1 hour, maximum 5 hours. I enjoy every minute of it, although the one I'm currently on is quite empty so that can make me sleepy here and there haha. That on-foot travel time, right?
---
Shadow priest.
---
Well it’s partly that I don’t want to fish and stuff like that if it’s gonna be wiped away in 2 months, so other than questing for fun there isn’t much I wanna do. I’m sure others are the same
---
How dare you talk about these things- they are unimportant.
---
Well I think that's a very important point that we can't ignore. You can't be sure it was the WoW token that 100% fixed the gold selling issue. I see you advocate heavily for its implementation, but if it was a combination of the token and the security measures over the years that both contributed in some meaningful way to bringing down the gold selling industry, it seems like "jumping the gun" to just implement the token into Classic without consideration for the effect it would have on the game itself.
---
I started playing the game in late BC/early Wrath and it didn't seem to me like hacking/gold selling was a big problem, at least not on my server. It didn't disrupt anyone's gameplay, I heard no horror stories of people's details being compromised. Bar the occasional advertisement in SW using lvl 1 corpses, you wouldn't think there were any gold sellers.
---
Priest a much stronger healer in nearly every scenario.
---
How long is too long to be this hard?
---
The Arcanite Transmute recipe is sold from a vendor, anyone can buy it.  Its not gated behind rep, or a rare drop.  Every single alchemist will have this xmute making its value that much less.
---
Well, it’s tough. If you don’t plan to be a serious raider but you want a t2 set, you’re definitely aiming for a long term casual guild experience. In which case you may actually find a spot as a pure ele. A more common scenario though is that you’ll be pressured into resto and end up healing 98% of the time and you’ll pick up some incidental ele gear. But if you want to be pure ele it’s not impossible.
---
I think you should play whatever’s in your heart. I know that sounds stupid. But if you really want to play shaman and you don’t have ties to a particular server, you will eventually find a guild to take you as 100% ele.
---
That being said, for your criteria here lock is the easier choice. You’re always dps, raids always need several, and the pvp is solid with minimal respeccing.
---
Blizzard is satanists confirmed!

I haven't played retail since WotLK.
---
I prefer my games to be accurate than to simulate shit machines for no reason.
---
/sarcasm
---
WHa... pfff.. Whaaaat? Nonsense! Optimization during the pex phase that will last 7 to 10 days of play will decide everything else, of course. Friends and people to play with or faction, should never be taken into account!
---
/sarcasm off
---
Yup, rolling a warrior and will for sure buy pots in the AH. It's stupid not to since it's worth the money when you are leveling a weak leveling class. Having alchemy and herbalism on a warrior is great for this reason but I'm hoping alchemist will flood the AH and sell for way to low prices. Always seems to be some dude who destroys the profit for everyone by selling at rock bottom prices.
---
Sorry but this loses credibility when saying that Tauren being druids doesn't make sense other than faction balance.
---
No.
---
That's it. Specs. 1 upside 10 downsides. All cos people want to play fucking Ret and enhance.
---
TBC pservers probably remain dead and unpopulated as people realise it's being a snowflake they crave. Not the specific specs.
---
Retail is garbage.
---
Engineering is BIS due to the battle chicken for PvE but it’s nowhere near a 10% increase. Much more useful profession for PVP. If you are a human you will use swords and maces because of the racial ability. Night elf or dwarf it doesn’t matter.
---
Reminds me of football commentary:
---
"That makes him the first Jets receiver in the past 14 years to jump 5 times, catch a pass, and make a first down at the 17 yard line."

"That's right, Tom. Absolutely incredible."
---
For real the gaming industry is so dead right now... I’ve been replaying Witcher 3 to pass the time
---
Good timing. Really wanted a long podcast to listen to at work today.
---
yeah prob right, i recon a 5 man or so will be ht best for farming phase. just reduces your downtime, you can take on larger forces if you outgear/level them heaps etc. and you will easily kill every 2-3man fast. whereas solo you will really need to pick and choose your fights.
---
Yes.
---

---
DoNt YoU gUyZ hAvE pHoNeZ?
---
It'll give you some perspective which is better than nothing. I literally just grinded a few mobs to get a feel of how the class played, I didn't do any dungeons or pvp
---
If you want to top damage in BG's, especially without the help of a pocket healer, then you should consider hunter. 
---
Hunters are amazing at BG's when they use the terrain to their advantage and kite people to death. At AV choke points you can easily sit back and rain free damage down on the enemies with minimal risk to yourself.
---
Rogues and Warriors will require heals to engage multiple opponents at once.
---
Shadowguard is super strong, you can basically just spam that one spell and melees will end up killing themselves. Ontop of that it procs blackout which is even more aids.
---
Well if you pick Alliance you have to deal with WOTF and Shadow Resistance on every Undead you fight.
---
&gt;Lore: In my eyes Night Elf are THE druid race.
---
This, ive always seen taurens more as shamans.
---
Going to roll NE druid in classic, mostly cuz m8s are rolling ally too but i definitely will miss that warstomp in pvp.
---
Sounds like u have ur mind made up
---
I made so many friends in dungeons, even joined some guilds because of them. After Wotlk introduced the the dungeon finder all these things vanished in an instant.
---
What does this have to do with classic
---
Have you thought about Troll? Their Shadowguard racial + 5/5 Blackout is very strong as you get a 27% chance of stunning any attacker 1-3 times each time you cast it (can save the day vs rogues/hunters).
---
WotF is ok vs locks, but Devouring Plague is overrated (crazy mana, less damage per mana than Shadowguard and will be cleansed by Paladins and worthless against mages/dwarves) and cannibalise is quite situational (needs a corpse).
---
My choice would be Troll &gt; Dwarf/Undead &gt; Human/Nelf.
---
No it's not if they both happen to press at the same time. It's if they press up to 200ms away from each other. That's how big the fucking window is.
---
What's there to settle? The blue post makes it clear. Their intention is to make it "common" and "reliable" that you resolve presses at the same time rather than which actually fucking happened first.
---
The question is to have engineers craft a trinket called "Arcanite Dragonling" this summonable pet casts flame buffet upon the target 60+ stacking up to 300.
---
It is similar to paladins Crusader seal which applies holy spell power to the caster when attacking the target with the debuff on. Very efficient if a group has a lot of fire damage.
---
Spot on.
---
i dunno, a bear with horns just look sorta weird to me.
---
If someone could release classic DoD and CS too thatd be great. 
---
Cash in on the disposable incomes of ageing gamers from 2000-2010.
---
Stutter stepped like a moba 1-10 on the stress test easily, either get a swing timer (please) or count the weapon delay in your head keeping in mind the .5 second wind up for an auto shot. You’ll have to auto occasionally like when you tag a close monster in a hurry in busy areas.
---
Why is everyone asking for what is easiest? If you really do not like the animations or the looks you should not choose that race, those things will matter more in the long run than making some pvp encounters slightly more easy. 
---
If all things are equal (looks etc), dwarf has objectively the best pvp racials (gameplay setting: Easy mode).
---
make a new character
---
Can't trust Forsaken :/. Honestly, Forsaken Rogues are kill on site, they have had a well earned reputation for 15 years now.
---
Evidently someone else already did
---
Holy crap, great job! Any plans of doing Goldshire?
---
Google drive? One drive?
---
That seems OP
---
I’m in the same boat. I will be going alc/ herbalism due to the fact that I want to make bank at 60.
---
8 classes which are basically the same other than theme?
---
I have the opposite problem. I have way too many games and too little time before classic comes out !
---
&gt; Always seems to be some dude who destroys the profit for everyone by selling at rock bottom prices.
---
I love those guys.  If you have the liquidity just buy up his stock and reset the market.  PROFIT.
---
Nefarian room was a bitch for 2005 pcs
---
It's funny how you wont just log on and test it. I've already done it and I couldn't react to any warrior charge, but I'd like to see you do it, maybe I'm just slow?
---
If you're looking at complete min maxing for pve, I think it would have to be gnome. It's the only one of the two that actually gets a damage bonus from its increased intelligence. In pvp I'm not entirly sure, that being said I think for mage will of the forsaken is better than escape artist.
---
Now if you're not trying to be in the top percent of raiders, I think youd be fine either way. I personally hate the gnome model, that being said I hate playing as the horde more so xD
---
Something to consider though is that in classic when you entered water that was too deep youd get dismounted. Due to their size, gnomes would get dismounted in certain areas that other races could just ride through. For me, that would bother me very much!
---
Eh, barrens chat on the server I'm playing on appears to be for edgy kids who like to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and just all together dumbass's. 
---
The worst part is I have to rejoin local everytime I leave the barrens then remember to leave when I come back through.
---
On topic: I'd go (troll) shaman based on thise criteria.
---
Atleast if the DKP isnt tallied in a public sheet.
---
3-6 years? Bit of an exaggeration I think, they could easily make massive improvements in the next expansion, which is not 3 years out.
---
TFT and the final fantasy releases on Switch
---
It's garbage and trash just like WoW since the launch of cata
---
Wednesdays at work suck a lot less because of this podcast. Excellent fucking work on the show!
---
Probably, looking for counter arguments.
---
I just started the Witcher 3 blood and wine dlc that I for some reason didn’t play so far. It’s amazon I have so much fun. Probably trying new game + after. Also playing dota 2 Party games with a friend every few days. I we also just wait for classic :D
---
D
---
It might be a waste of time but I figure that the starting zones will be complete chaos on release. So I want to do this as an experiment of sorts to see if I can make some cash early on.
---
Running to a high lvl zone as a lvl 1 character in search of some chests is my own little adventure I guess :)
---
Where did you see this? Source please.
---
WoW is probably the least toxic game out there.
---
This is so true, classes and roles are so defined now that you enter almost every encounter in retail with a rigid rountine that you'll have to follow to win. The last time I saw anything that I would call "clutch" was back in cataclysm. Running Grim Batol heroic we were on the boss that summons exploding fixtating elementals, and the DPS warrior in the group got fixated. He didnt give a shit though, and through various charges, stance dancing and stuns he stun locked the elemental fixated on him and solo'd it. ~absolute legend~. I've played every expansion since then and nothing comes close to that since there's so little out of the box thinking now.
---
It is. Your hitbox is massive the moment you start moving in any direction.
---
\+ Devouring plague can be very strong in 1on1 or world pvp, but in organized PVP it will get decursed very fast.
---
Have you modified the weighing for the criteria to get a better fit?
---
To be fair, the MT should ALWAYS be the most active person in the entire guild.
---
Mages are awesome, but if your main criteria is 1v1 they are middle of the pack, unless you are very, very good. In pure 1v1 duel scenarios they do better because they can restart fights, get out of combat and drink, and ultimately control the flow of the match. But in an open world/bg 1v1 scenario you don’t often have that pure open field reset ability. 
---
They get crushed by hunters and shadow priests, and have a very tough matchup against locks and druids. All in all, don’t pick a mage if you’re going to 1v1 all day. 
---
And warriors are garbage in 1v1. Literally dead last in the power rankings.
---
I’m downvoting because it’s a poorly written post 🤷🏼‍♂️ all you do is say “8.2 is bad” over and over again in slightly different variations. You don’t convey any information, it’s just kinda rambling
---
8.2 just hit, so I’m checking that out. Stellaris and Jurassic World: Evolution got some fresh new updates recently which have been fun, too.
---
Furry warrior is amazing in pve and arms is a God in pvp with a priest behind him. Dont feel like you have to tank with it. Other than that though, you're kinda looking for a class that has similar mobility to priest. That would mean shaman and druid are less optimal. Rogue would also be decent.
---
What class?
---
Shadowguard is spammable just like lightning sheild, crits over 500+, procs Blackout and Shadow Weaving.  Berserking lets you cast faster, more burst for more Blackouts.  
---
Hex of Weakness is a 36 yard mini mortal strike.  If Hex was your only racial, I'd still say Troll is best.
---
yeah, swing timer is very important to have as a hunter. a must have
---
Only in phase 1 though.
---
I want to play another spec but I have to continue playing my mage because that toon is the one yo to date with main story and reputations to unlock Zandalari.
---
no source. Hamstring kiting is currently bugged, obviously things it will be fixed? lol
---
Tbc is like vanilla but with a bunch of extra bad content on top. It wasn't until later expansions did they polish this and make it better.
---
And what are we at?
---
What changes happened that people are happy about? I haven't been following?
---
I feel this. I never could get a character over my level 42 dwarf paladin. Just kept making new characters
---
It's not about what's easiest. I like Undead animations and looks a lot. Hell, my main was a Troll for 5 years. I like at least 1 gender in most races, I think most of them look great even in Vanilla. Dwarf is the only race in game that I don't like both genders - but obviously the best for priests. From what people are saying Horde are generally better for PvP. 
---
You see, I was a PvE'er for good 12 years. I was even quite hardcore at some point. Now I'm coming back and want to do solely PvP. I acknowledge the fact that there will be better players than me, for sure. And for these scenarios I don't mind admitting that I want the advantage I'll surely need.
---
well they are situational as a lot of bosses have fire immunity at least early on and they have low hp thus for a boss with aoe they also fall short but the other pets are viable for those fights :)
---
in particular i enjoy its threat reduction, the succubus serves well in cases the boss is tauntable and where tank has more than sufficient TPS while the felhunter is excelent when it comes to firemaw or similar even tho it doesnt have such a high amount of damage i think pets often outweigh being sacrificed unless u can enslave another pet like the ZG imp \^\^ sadly MC imp cant be enslaved.
---
For the life of me I can't decide between Mage and Warlock.  Whenever I've read up on people's opinions, it seems like 2 out of 3 people recommend Mage over Warlock for overall capability.
---
I'll be going Alliance, and I'm interested in both PvP and PvE.
---
From a PvE perspective, I'm okay with the boring rotations.  I know they're both great at solo farming, with Mage being the only true AoE farming class, but both can still run DM for gold.  A perk would be not having to respec constantly, if one class is better for that.
---
From a PvP perspective, everyone mentions Warlocks being shut down by undead, but WoTF doesn't really phase me because from an organized group perspective I wouldn't have to deal with Paladin cleansing, which I'd count as evening out that disadvantage.  Outside of that they're very strong, as are mages.
---
I think the issue I'm facing is that I'd rather play a Warlock, but I'm concerned about buyer's remorse of watching Mages outshine me at most or even every aspect of the endgame.
---
I know this is one of the most common questions, but any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks!
---
For me, and i'm pretty sure for the majority of the people in this sub, comparing retail with classic is like comparing apples with bananas. It's a different cup of tea tailored for a different experience, and it will always be subjective.
---
Sick take dawg.
---
And write your new subs on the board behind you!
---
"Only" for 3+ months. Nice one.
---
Since everyone is starting fresh together the AH won't be relevant for a while. Skinning is more for selling to vendors for a bit, but it is listed as profitable. Herb is a good call too if gold is the main concern. Personally I enjoy taking my time and leveling profs while I level, for immersion, but to each their own!
---
Nef's quote and vocals as he lands on the platform were so damn good.
---
Because it splits up the server community
---
So I’ve decided on an SM/Ruin warlock for solo play because the casual PvP without respec seems great for where I am IRL and warlocks seem dope. 
---
If I’m only casually going to PvP, am I right to roll a human or undead over orc/gnome?
---
Second, I’m planning on getting the SO in on the action. She wants a roll a rogue - I take it running a shadow priest would probably be a bit too close in terms of overlap? Any ideas on what’s best to pair with a rogue for both alliance/horde?
---
18,236
---
I believe that even with massive improvements they'll still be a bit careful not to change everything (that we think is bad), those type of changes might occur as a snowball effect. Hence me thinking 3 years might be the minimum. I do hope I'm wrong however, and I would be happy if they can do it with the next expansion  :)
---
As opposed to half the specs in classic being useless?
---
Goes to show just how easy hunter is:D
---
depends on your gear. You will need to test it. the better gear you have and most consumebles you use the higher lvl spell you can use. also depends on the demand. You should be aware how much each lvl heals, and chose the level of the spell based on the health the player needs. if someone need 1k hp you should not use a 1.5k heal on him. there are some addons that help heal
---
Wotf isn't op. Orc racial is. 25% flat stun resist is way better than 5 second immunity to fear charm and sleep on a 2 min cd.
---
Alterac mountains as ally is pretty brutal too, no matter what you res in southshore..
---
Depends on the mob. Most things aren't normalized in Classic.
---
yo guys i came up with this Ret/ Holly build that i think i could use in raids and in pvp, if i stick in the mele group i should be effective at dishing out some heals, buffing with might, and doing some dps on the side (if they allow me to).
---
Basically I am a wanna be ret but I recognise that the spec is super useless, and I wanna be raid viable.
---
My classic dream is to get the currupted ashbringer, wish me luck :p
---
Can't we just leave the game as-is with the internet we have today for fucks sake?!
---
How is Hamstring kiting bugged? Where's your source on this?
---
Sorry but I'm having a hard time understanding where you're coming from. Hamstring kiting never worked in retail Vanilla. It was a waste of time due to leeway.
---
I made the mistake to hype myself 3 months before launch, imagine people who did it when it was annonced
---
Disgusting
---
I'll take a stab at this.
---
It wasn't so much complicated as the natural flow of any product or software is to always evolve and move forward. Every patch improved the game whether it was fixing bugs, adding new content, or updating existing content to make the game more accessible. Full xpacs are notable milestone and version updates where bigger overhaul could be considered. Naturally, as an MMORPG evolves, older content becomes less relevant to the new content.
---
Blizzard was and has always been in uncharted territory in the MMORPG space. They were the forerunners of the true smash hit MMORPG and even when it launched they didn't know what they had. They developed the product as best they could with the knowledge they had at the time.
---
There was no reason to believe a decade ago that a sizeable player base would actually *want* to revert all those patches and evolutions to a prior state. The retro/rehash approach to gaming and other forms of entertainment wouldn't hit its stride until a bit later in the 2010s.
---
They just never foresaw this as a need and actually saw it as a 'definitely won't do'.
---
Enter the motivated people you talk about who did see it as a need and was willing to fulfill it where Blizzard wouldn't.
---
I'd be surprised if there weren't at least a minor voice within Blizzard that would sometimes bring up Classic servers in quarterly/annual '5 year roadmap' talks, especially when Cataclysm was slated to shake up original Azeroth. I'm not surprised Blizzard didn't move on it, especially since it would be parasitic to its own game.
---
Now that their business model continues to shift towards microtransactions and the 'theme park' style of content progression that people burn through quickly they see it as less parasitic and more supplementary. They're counting on Classic to fill in the content droughts between big patches and xpacs, in addition to bringing in people they thought they had lost.
---
For better or worse, Blizzard finally got around to doing this and it will work out in the long run for everyone. Following this sub throughout the beta and the high attention to proper Vanilla duplication it sounds like the good old Blizzard that wants to do it right rather than fast. Maybe that comes off as needlessly complicated to some, but it's appreciated by others. People wanted Classic, but those people would agree they'd rather have it done right after 2 years of announcement than done fast and wrong 1 year after.
---
When young men and women intermingle, there is BOUND to be drama. Always.
---
I'm glad it's not here yet. I still can't decide my class....let alone which hair I want...I am not prepared.
---
Blackenigma hahaha, stupid kid i was
---
Classic has at least a 2 years shelf life, so yeah only 3 months.
---
The time you will need those BL the most layering will be a distant memory.
---
Druids aren't a good dungeon healer, they don't have a rez. That and until certain gear points at 60, they just aren't the most useful as a healer. 
---
Druids should tank until they have the gear at 60 to heal.
---
To get out of the chaotic rush slightly ahead
---
Why don’t people stop posting about this? It’s the same suggestions over and over again, this is not a new idea.
---
I have to admit that at first glance I wasn't impressed with Troll racials but now that you point it out, and it seems like you're speaking from experience, they become much more likely a choice for me. Now Trolls are added to the equation.
---
Did a priest throw you from felwood to darkshore?
---
I specifically was looking for it, and talked with other people who were upset it wasn't in there.
---
So I'm legitimately confused now what to believe.
---
I'm just wondering where msbr's multimillion selling game with an incredible legacy is so I can buy a copy
---
So is mining. In Westfall the defias cave had about a dozen tin spawns in one small area
---
In terms of sheer running, Ranazjar Isle in Desolace is pretty bad. If you die on that island fighting the nagas or just getting ganked, you have to cross a huge chunk of Desolace and then run across the sea again.
---
How good could the final moments be for a bunch of sheep who are giving a corporation free beta testing. 
---
They have you hook, line and sinker.
---
What kind of question is that? Of course they want retail to do well, well = more money.  Also wow isn't even closer to a Asian grind game.
---
I'm playing warcraft 3 online. The custom games. I enjoy Legion td, hellhalt td, line tower wars and various tower defenses. It's great for few hours a day.
---
I would not worry about that to much.
---
I think there will be so many players and guilds and raids that. Personality, how much time you want to invest, time of the raid will have more influence. 
---
And if you are on time to every raid, and already there waiting with all the stuff you need and play a solide game without major regular mess ups you will find a cool group
---
Well making WoW was a huge investment and a giant risk.
---
Anywhere in a cave.  I hate caves,  I always get lost. But also the corpse run if you die in BRD always sucked.
---
I think you meant Hex of Weakness.
---
I play three different classes and all of them got gutted. I have no motivation to level another through the boring leveling experience. Or, worse, give Blizzard another $50 to realize the new class is also boring.
---
How are you able to create characters early?
---
Yeah, it's called bias. He's clearly a NE
---
&gt;Yes, because that won't impact your Role Play interactions with *me.*
---
So when the op asks about toggleable client-side graphics - you are okay with that. you don't think everyone else should be forced to endure lower quality graphics because that's not what you intended for them to see.
---
Yes exactly. They turned up the spawn rate at one point and forgot to adjust it down again at least on LH
---
Black ops 4 really lost its touch wish I coulda been into it for a few more weeks
---
My problem is I've spent the last 5 years on 1.x and 2.x private servers and now I'm burned the hell out and chomping at the bit for 3.3.
---
The buffs don't matter since you will have resto druids that can cover that. Other than innervate they do not have more utility than a mage, so that doesn't make up that big of a gap.
---
Pubg is (was yesterday at least) on sale on Steam for 15 bucks, I picked that up to pass the time even though I don't care much for battle royales.  Nothing is really holding my attention, I screwed around in Nazjatar yesterday for the new patch while pubg downloaded and I got bored in about 10 minutes of forgettable, uninspired quests I never want to repeat.
---
Meanwhile, quests from vanilla are seared into my brain permanently, and I don't get bored doing them repeatedly.
---
This was on SH
---
But if 80% is off doing DM runs, the whole world is left to the other players. If im making money in DM i will use that money to buy goods from other players whos out farming in different places.
---
And if my time is worth 50-100 gold per hour, so is their time. Meaning that they can get at least 50g/hour selling me the stuff that I dont farm.
---
For Example doing strat runs for crusader orbs. A healer and 4 warriors can run through the dungeon very quickly and gain a lot of gold. 
---
The market controls itself. If solo DM was the only good place for cash, sure it would be a problem. But its not. You just have to be creative.
---
I feel this is a big difference between time-gating content and not releasing content til later.
---
Daily's and weekly lock-outs are real time-gated content and the make my gaming experience worse. I just want to hope on a game and determine my own goals in a plethora of content. When I have to log on daily to be efficient or even weekly to raid then logoff til next week, the game is no longer a fun way to waste time at my convenience rather than a prison to consume my time.
---
Vanilla was great but it felt worse in the later years when all there was to do was log on weekly for the latest raid. And reason I player more than that was for lvling alts and farming what I could for them, stuff that wasn't time-gated. Even grinding rep was great because it was time-gated and I could eventually work towards something at my own pace. Whether that pace is all day long on certain days while not playing on other days, or just a few hours each day. 
---
Retail is awful in my opinion because of the time-gating, it's what ruins any game for me.
---
I also took two days off, and most people don't understand how great it is to be slightly ahead of the pack. The same chaos everyone mentions is exactly why you want to know how to be fast at first and know where everything is
---
Undead rogue is a good option so you're not competing for gear. Plus you'd likely win all of your world pvp fights!
---
It was just that tho. Hype. I keep saying when it comes to actually playing, nobody shows up
---
I didn't mention mention Classic, but sure. Classic is appealing because of other things like playing in an actual world, being able to do professions, getting to know people on my server, etc. Retail is fun for its endgame PvE gameplay. And if I don't find that gameplay fun...?
---
I get peoples concerns a bit as game like Destiny, The Division, Destiny 2, Anthem, The Division 2 all had Betas and couldn't fix shit even months after release. But this is Blizzard AND it's WoW Classic. Gamebreaking bugs are super rare.
---
Going through the game manuals and the illustrations was a big part of the whole WC2 experience for me. When graphics could only go so far, you had illustrations to really show you what was going on in fine detail. Those days are now long gone.
---
I see, you really seem to like those D's
---
If you want ashbringer then roll a tank
---
Get a warrior friend and 2 man dm east
---
One pro for tauren, due to it's increased stamina and str is better offtank to soak cleave dmg.
---
layering &amp; leeway are things that should not exist in classic. one enables a tremendous amount of exploit while the other is a mechanic that was meant to make up for a terrible connection that existed upon its original release when players only had a 50th to 200th of what is now considered minimum/normal upload/download.
---
I was playing this cheap unknown tower defence game called fortified for a while which was fun
---
Literally all i did in Vanilla and in legitimately excited to do it again
---
Who knows, I feel like in this case they could have gotten one, or maybe they actually had one, but had to say they couldn’t or else they’d break the catfish too early.
---
Good luck man. You could definitely heal with that spec. I used a reckoning spec on a few private servers to heal. Missing the Crit sucked but I felt like I made up for it by having a big shlong.
---
DM = Dire Maul for Horde. Alliance can just bicker amongst themselves.
---
Any video?
---
That dude improved the girls life immeasurably. It's heartwarming when someone gets encouragement and strengthens their own willpower and goes down the road of self improvement. It sucks for her ex but at the end of the day she's healthier, probably has better self esteem, and is with the person who helped her get there. 
---
You should encourage the guild leader to self improve too. Exercise really does help with depression. It's a lot easier to kick negativity when you like what you see in the mirror.
---
how come, thats a 2 hander? or is it just a flavor weapon that they get for the lols?
---
Well on private server you gain alot of time as the mob have a fix attack speed, and with the kiting and slow weapon you receive around 1.5x less damage in the long run it does add alot, but yeah I don’t bother with it also and just face tank,
---
Some of my time i invest in overwatch, ESO or Dauntless. But most of my Time i just read Books and Chinese Wuxia Lightnovels :)
---
Warriors. Enhancement shaman versus warrior was a pretty shitty setup.
---
No, I wanted to point out, that Undeads DP is not as good as it seems and that has to be accounted in a direct comparison between troll and undead.
---
And i missed to add, that it is so expensive to cast, that one should almost always couple it with inner focus.
---
Priests have better raid utility, but you know this already. Although imo if you are dedicated to healing, Druid is still a great pick. You'll have less contention for gear and you will still get a spot in raids. Overall if you've played priest you will probably have more fun trying something new anyway.
---
shamans dont do any damage...even if they try.
---
so its better to have them as healers when supplying wind fury totem.  in a perfect world you only take as many healers as you need and that dps shaman spot could go to a class that would do real damage.
---
i have seen raids have too many healers and take an enhancement shaman for nightfall duty.  this isnt optimal though
---
It is there. You have to check a box. 
---
Played the stress test, turned it on.
---
hopefully someone will teach you how to play
---
because vanilla Graveyards are more sparse and sometimes can be very far away from your body if you are unlucky
---
I mean who would? Druid taking the eye is just insane.
---
He streamed them all, did maybe 10 runs 1-30 in the beta and hes streaming right now at lvl 22
---
I'm mainly interested in the leeway parts so the timestamps are appreciated.
---
Every build has pretty much been tried and tested, might be fun while leveling though
---
Rb6, Dota, RoE
---
Dying in an opposing factions zone. If you're ally, you have like 1 bad GY in barrens.
---
As a JRE listener DMT can only ever be associated with one sentence and it starts like this "have you ever tried..."
---
With the mod you're still having the press a different key to exit the form. I agree its somewhat overcomplicated and somewhere in this thread we came to a better solution!
---
Seeing how the other half lives this go around, I’ve settled on Warrior, but I just don’t know what race. 
---
Narrowed to Nelf, Gnome. I know pvp is gonna be a big part of our end game. 
---
Nelf have the dodge and passive Agi. Plus Shadowmeld for sick ganks. 
---
Also the wisp form feels underrated for the most dead class in the game. 
---
Gnomes have escape artist which for a warrior seems like a no brainer. 
---
Thoughts?
---
If by useless you mean reaping ridiculous coin than yes, it will be useless. People forget what vanilla was like. No 10 stacks of potions, flasks and other sundries filling your packs. These things cost legit coin in vanilla, coin you won't have a lot of. (assuming of course blizzard doesn't doom classic from the jump and allow the token system)
---
You're just a gnome. Orcs are civilized and don't want to harm poor defenceless creatures
---
It will be fun when they start reintroducing half of the stuff (seriously, why no invite suggestion?).
---
Bruh this happened to me in live what's this about classic?
---
How are you unsure about that? What's wrong with physical fitness?
---
so a raid leader should take dead weight over someone who can help the raid because they can clear it with the dead weight...odd logic
---
I've been doing the same thing, leveling from about 1-20 on private servers, just to hammer out my route for Tauren leveling.  I know Durotar super well, but I never really played a Tauren back in the day, so I want to make sure I've got their starter down so I can (hopefully) stay with or ahead of the pack on launch and don't get bogged down in my first 12 levels before breaking out to the Barrens.
---
Luckily 1-12 is only about 2 hours so it's not a lot of time to invest in practicing that start zone, then taking it to 20ish if I don't feel like making a new character right away.  I'm not too worried about burnout.
---
What if I've already picked. Now I'm just stuck on this godamn sub hitting refresh every 10minutes.
---
Looks alright.  Holy Reckoning Paladins do the same thing but Prot/Holy and heal raids with those same Holy talents.  They bring Kings and Imp Concentration Aura to a raid though, so if that's not required of you then you'll be fine.
---
Tagging on because I’ve been torn between the two and mages are super cool, but being able to casually PvP in SM/Ruin without constantly respec’ing has pushed me to lock.
---
You did not mention it but Warcraft 3 Reforged also has potential to shine. Of course it's not a new product, just a legacy of a glorious past so your point still stands.
---
Concerning Classic monetization, I am not sure that they will introduce any. No paid content is part of the old school image of the project.
---
If they do, I will just walk away (possibly back to private servers if I still want to play Vanilla WoW). In the meantime, we should all just enjoy the moment.
---
*Have at them, boyyyssss!*
---
Great game.
---
If you're looking for a challenge and varied playstyle out of the ones you've listed, shammy sounds like the winner. Plus horde &gt; alliance
---
Found the old blue post during patch 5.4.7 (near the end of MoP):
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#131814318748](https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#131814318748) 
---
A more recent blue post does confirm that they are still Spell batching, but that the window is much smaller. Celestalon seems to be confused on that point. But he does confirm that the timing is down to around 1-10MS (or that is their goal) at that time, and his post is in reply to that change being noticed sometime during that expansion. If the change had occurred early, theory crafters would have noticed it earlier.
---
Exactly what I was thinking. I play some old games still and that's the thing that keeps me hooked.
---
a horde player dying in the tram room near the iron forge portal
---
The WC3 Saga is easily among my all-time favorites. Even if you don't care about the lore, if you're a gamer you should play WC3. It's the father of the modern MMO, the father of the MOBA, the father of Tower Defense, and in my opinion the last great casual RTS (Starcraft 2 is cool but it's not made for plebs who only have a passing interest in the genre like WC3).
---
WC3 and TFT set the scene for what is going on in WPL/EPL/Strat/Naxx, but not only do they set the scene but they tell a fantastic story. Arthas's rise, fall, and rise again as Deathknight Arthas and later the Lich King is epic as hell. Let's be real, the Lich King is the Darth Vader of video games and you're missing almost all of his story if you never played WC3.
---
Deadmines was called DM before Diremaul was even in game.
---
I guess i can bring Imp might, thats something
---
what game is this?
---
Well, my friends still hasnt figured out which Faction we are gonna play in, split decision so far. So Im checking my options, trying to see every angle to aid on this decision. I've only played BFA and I rolled Horde on all my characters. So Im a new player, far from "top raider" material. Gonna play like 3 hours a day. I like both PvE and PvP.
---
Tbh Gnome and Undead models are okay-ish for me, neither is my favorite race in Vanilla. Undead animations are cool but I dont like their face and hunch. Male gnomes are the worst, but female are funny at least. My favorite would probably be Orc. But as you know, Mage Orc combo is a no-go in Classic.
---
Yea, I saw a video of the water dismount, yikes! But I think I wouldnt be very bothered by it.
---
Yes, that'd be awesome!
---
That is pretty dismissive honestly. Not to mention ALL specs became insanely better, as they had much better ideas for how to handle many things as well as itemization.
---
I did not argue the rest though I don't agree, but there is no reason to basically crap all over something people like. I love Enh so much I am playing it now on Live. Anyone aware of how THAT is going knows its gotta be more than snowflake status to keep at that.
---
Keep it authentic. Snap an image with your point and shoot and send it to the chemists to be developed before scanning it into Coral Paint.
---
Some people dont care about the orbs and otherwise, they just want the group up and a fast run, they just want gear upgrades from being fresh etc.
---
People can reserve if they want, I wont hold it against them but I probably wouldn't join them, its still going to be a thing, people will do the runs and they will get the orbs wether we like it or not.
---
If people dont want to get along with that, then they dont have to, but that doesn't mean that someone else wont.
---
It's mostly a private server thing and its going to be transfered over in some form or another, its just how it is, people dont play this game the same way, because everyone knows the values of everything.
---
They dont have the divine right, they just run the group that way and will blacklist you accordingly if you dont follow the rules.
---
That's just what I have to say about that.
---
This!
---
I wished Troll spines would be just a little bit more upright, then I wouldnt have such a hard time to decide, which race to play :-P
---
Play however makes you happy, but I just wouldn't have high hopes for the chest contents.
---
I've read you can level up quite nicely for a few levels from exploration XP thoguh, so you'll have that working in your favor.
---
I mean, they eventually made Tauren paladins work too, but Druidism was tied to Elune, no?
---
Interesting, do you have a source for that?
---
Try path of exile if you like arpg. Its pretty much the successor of diablo 2. And has the same addiction effect as wow if not more. Got 10k plus hours in it since 2014.
---
And you may be absolutely correct when it comes to him.  
---
I guess I just look at what amazing work he has done and it really isn't the reposting of it with credit given that I feel is in the wrong here.  It's the fact that he has altered the work as he saw fit.  Sharing your own vision of an artists work that you spent 5 minutes re-coloring with photoshop just strikes me as wrong.
---
But you are correct, not all artists feel this way.
---
2handers are pretty much pvp toys, particularly at 4HM levels of gear. Depending on how weapon procs scale with spell damage in classic (one area where private servers are very much guessing) corrupted ashbringer COULD be more of a pally prio...
---
I've been testing almost that same spec on "places" and it works really nicely. I'm able to dps or heal based on gear and having no problems.
---
I think *all* the tauren druid lore was invented for WoW. There's nothing like that in WC 3.
---
They can't do a BC rerelease, I'd have to quit my job, get a divorce and abandon my children.

Idk, but this brought flashbacks of ganking at the entrance to Stonetalon mountain.  That walk is very frustrating for new players just getting out of the Barrens.

---
He never dinged 10 before 2 hours, nobody can do a level 10 run in 1 hour.
---
ah i see, well then i got a fair chance at it we good
---
No I'm only playing for an hour or so every now and then.  I'm just familiarising myself with a couple of levelling routes and other early level basics.  I haven't gone past level 14 on any chars.
---
Well obviously objective if none of the tbc private servers are succeeding.
---
&gt; If you really do not like the animations or the looks you should not choose that race, those things will matter more in the long run than making some pvp encounters slightly more easy.
---
This is absolutely not true for every player. Looks/animations etc matter little compared to having the best racials for me.
---
You just described every single zone in Cataclysm.
---
1.6 us still alive.
---
In before classic is last minute delayed 6 days
---
Out of curiosity why do you say that it will break fast? Does it have less durability than DD or something?
---
Never add one nor draconian deflector back in the time.
---
Sorry for complicating matters further! I've pvp'd as human/undead/troll and definitely prefer troll.
---
If it's that bad then you are a snowflake proving my point.
---
it's clean. it's just a 55 MB jpeg
---
Was that a full 40 pug or did most the group leave quick?
---
is it free to play? ( i know stupid question its blizzard wtf)
---
How is it not? I actually love what they did in the later expansions. If I want to PvP, PvP gear should be the best one for it.
---
I had PvE pieces as late as cata. Weapon and 2t13.
---
Why are you comparing 1 person with a billionaire development company with hundreds of full time employees
---
You're confusing me with a NoChanger
---
I am sorry you are too angry to understand others viewpoints. Thanks for your input.
---
Well in private servers it does, but that's the issue. Private servers aren't Blizzard-like and so there are many values that are off and do things that they aren't supposed to do.
---
I have no idea if it did work like that back in vanilla, that's what I'm trying to find out
---
Heroes of the Storm baby! I will never understand the hate for that game.

the amount of money i had to spend to get thorium brotherhood rep was greater than the money you get for crafting nightfalls/annihilators/sulfaras hammers.  the big one people look for is the nightfall.  not only do you need maximum thorium rep for the recipe but you need to craft it inside of BRD
---
you can make some money with engineering (sappers, bullets, grenades, etc) but its not a big money maker.  the real value in these items comes form gathering the materials. herbing/engineering would be your optimal professions at lvl 60.  herbing so you can farm consumes and sell herbs.  engineering is a most have for any raider
---
It sounds more like he’s saying the vanilla client only utilizes one core, and classic may use all. My point is that the new classic client from the stress test gave me more FPS issues than running wrath. I can get great fps on a private server but the stress test gave me low FPS after 10-15 min of playing even after toning the settings down. If the graphics aren’t any different, I don’t see why my laptop is struggling. I used the second highest resolution in 1.12 client that had (wide) in it. The options in classic feel different and when I tried to do the same it didn’t give me the same results.
---
I'm replaying FF8 right now lol. Man those graphics are painful using a ps3 on a 4k TV lol, but still fun.
---
I'd go swords.  And im in the same boat as you on professions.  I know Engineering is best PVP, but something is drawing me to herb/alc.  In the end i probably go mining/eng, but still...  potions in vanilla are extremely useful.
---
Using any of these skills will cripple your leveling speed. Also backstab is hardly even better for pvp compared to ss.
---
Damn! That is the craziest one I have read so far!
---
AFAIK blizzard will allow you to log into character creation 2 weeks before to create characters but not log into the actual world.
---
"not maximally optimal for raiding" is not the same as "useless".  please stop perpetuating this weird myth.
---
Skipping flightpaths isn't really a thing. But what above commment said is smart. Picking some up in advance for later.
---
Becauase I'm stupid and all this time I thought we were talking about the Force reactive disk.
---
Playing finish a years worth of home renovation in 2 months ;\
---
Most of the group left quick, probably didn’t see any loot they wanted.
---
It’s generally a matter of how prevalent it is in this sub, not just this post or comment thread. This sub is generally either “man, can’t wait for classic!” or “rawr! Retail is dogshit and people that play it are stupid”. If anyone mentions retail, there’s a typical “retail is shit” comment, which eventually is just propagating toxicity.
---
Oh I see, yeah it's very expensive!
---
Rank 1 Hex still is -20% healing and costs 35 mana I think.
---
Why does alliance have more than the horde? Alliance bias
---
enjoy your mud huts and spikes
---
&gt;Nearly every single problem that has driven me permanently from retail was spawned by the advent of the token system.
---
Layering is happening.... too late to make a suggestion
---
That cave in Felwood that would spawn your ghost in Darkshore. 
---
Yes, you'll either walk 20 minutes through all of Darkshore, half of Ashenvale and full Felwood or take the repair bill and debuff.
---
Well he's quick to judge them on being lazy and inept, so I just wanted to see what he's accomplished.
---
I personally would want to actually try for something in TBC since I never played much beyond Kara. About 2 months in I had pretty much needed to move on from 3 nonstop years of WoW for a while and wouldn't really play seriously again until WOTLK. 
---
I have no interest in pservers but if Blizz gets around to doing TBC I would jump aboard and attempt to see the raids.
---
I actually dont know what I will do if it is delayed....
---
Same sub as retail.
---
There will be no tokens in Classic, aas stated from a CM or something like that. Saw it in the official forum.
---
August 27th cannot get here soon enough.  I never thought i'd wish away a summer in upstate new york, but that's where i find myself.  Besides, this has been a very wet and cold spring/summer thus far anyway so might as well just get it over with.  Plus Fall rules.  Turkey, Halloween, Football, long sleeve tee shirts.  What's not to like?
---
"Retail is the process of selling consumer goods or services to customers through multiple channels of distribution to earn a profit."
---
The pedantic side of me says you are wrong.
---
Depends on your gear gap to everyone else.  As a rogue in vanilla, I'd be top on kills/damage quite often.  Stealth gives you a lot of freedom to go around and do what you want, bypass chokes, instead of just sitting in the back.
---
But I'd still say between Hunter/Rogue if you're looking for solo PvP situations.  Rogues get the jump and as sub spec, you have A LOT of outs, but hunters as much have scatter shot/traps/cheetah to get away so if you're good you can kite every class.
---
Because a few motivated fans doing a love project private server can throw their hands up at any time and say "we can't fix this bug" or "we're shutting down" and no one can blame them, no one is going to fire them for failure, no shareholders breathing down their necks, etc.
---
Blizzard has to make it right or fans will lose their fucking minds (see literally any post in this sub), and while I'm no programmer, I'm going to go ahead and assume it's not just "take private server source code, fix bugs and BAM, done!"
---
I loved BWL. It was a bit more hardcore than MC, and the loot was so sweet. I loved my tier 2 shoulders so so much.
---
Well lots of pservers till more of a job with less bugs than blizzards 4months world wide beta.
---
No marriage, no foul. It's important to Consider that the original relationship may not have been worth preserving as a possibility. I've seen friends with low self esteem get in relationships where their partner had low self esteem too. It creates a feedback loop that can end up in codependency where they just drag each other down.  If the end result is the end of one relationship, the self improvement of one party of that relationship and the formation of a new stronger relationship, that's a win.
---
Crap that means I only have 60 days to finally decide on my race/class/name
---
I can’t speak for Horde quests, but I’ve been slowly making my way through the Beta testing nearly every single Alliance quest at the appropriate level while updating my quest completionist guide (https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm).
---
If faction is your main concern, you should know that priest play very differently in premade pvp on alliance and horde (no matter the race) because of the difference between paladins and shamans. On alliance side priests role is much more offensive (which makes priest on alliance more fun to play in premade pvp in my opinion).
---
Exact same case for me in London, UK :P
---
We also have people calling Classic “Vanilla”, which we know it isn’t. People will use the names they want, but as soon as Classic is live, it’s a variant of retail regardless of what you may or may not call it.
---
1h vs 2h does not change range (nor should it). You are correct about Tauren though.
---
DM was always Diremaul on my server. At least on horde.
---
Tanks actually don't stack resist gear. That's mostly everybody else.
---
Huntards unite!
---
If you play playing "who-can-press-the-button-first" game, then sure.  
---
That's not WoW is all about though, that would be a shame.  
---
Also, you might be forgetting ping is a thing. The first button press might reach the server second due to varying latency between players.  
---
So, unless you have some revolutionary tech to combat that issue, striving for perfect accuracy is just going to devolve into "who lives next to the server" competition.
---
Dota 2. Has plenty of WC3 vibes still.
---
I levelled as prot/ret and it was great for solo and PvP. It was only when I hit 60 and had to be raid geared and spec'd. Try to sneak through blackrock mountain in that damn bright teal dress - I swear it's like a beacon for Horde players.
---
Bruh one drop per boss on a pug. Gotta pass that second piece to another brother.
---
That was my first 60 and yeah, you had every reason to hate them.
---
Never forget when I was in Tanaris and a few rogues I knew personally were ganking people. One of them had the crit dagger from  I think UBRS. I heard them nearby so popped an AOE fear and found them both, and proceeded to murder them alone. Not because I was skilled, but because I was a shadowpriest.
---
Who?  After playing th stress test and playing multiple private servers over the years, the beta is just gorgeous graphically, and plays much smoother than any private server I've played on.
---
Ooooh so toxic to call a game shit. Toxiccccccccccccccc! Get a grip.
---
Honestly, if that's the case then I would like to stress how important it is you like the look of your character. If you hate it now, eventually you'll regret it. It will suck :/ for me I'd go human all the way. Their reputation gain is also super good saves a ton of time. Racails are nice, but for over 99% of situations, it probably wont matter in PvE content. 
---
Model &gt; Racial imo
---
Normal games that I've enjoyed, retail, gw2, eso, osrs, ffxiv and rust, some little single player games too.
---
Play what's fun to you, that means try other games because there's no use limiting yourself just because you're waiting for a single game to have its second full release.
---
&gt; Leveling in the original was ~~challenging~~ dull on purpose.
---
ftfy
---
you talk about herbalism for blacksmithing items?
---
mining / blacksmithing is a solid one to go for.
---
If I squint while watching mobile it kinda looks like a Star Wars space battle scene.
---
Umm it destroyed the economy, made achievements useless and created unbearable toxicity. Just for starters.
---
Want a mythic clear achievement and title? Mommy's credit card and a few tokens and you'll find a group willing to carry you thru at any gear or skill level.
---
Any questions?
---
Ah awesome and i souls Guess any raid leader would be happy with a versatile player
---
Because of the Wintersaber trainers. the Horde doesn't have a Faction that is only for a Mount.
---
What the fuck? How can it be almost two years?
---
BDOs combat isn't anywhere close to WoW (Classic or BFA). It's *kind of* similar to ESO but even more active/chaotic. Combat isn't "target based" like WoW or Rift or TERA or other traditional MMORPGs. 
---
Instead, you have 10 (15? 20? don't honestly remember) different abilities, all of which interact with other abilities and keybinds in cool ways. For example, your E keybind makes your shift+leftclick combo into either S+leftclick or W+leftclick (based on whether you need to backup or engage further), which you can then combo into (yada yada). 
---
It sounds super minmaxxy and complex, but it isn't all too difficult... well in PvE, if you don't know what you're doing in PvP, you're just going to get your teeth kicked in, but PvP deaths don't really do anything, so it isn't a big deal. 
---
BDO is a lot of fun until you hit that wall that u/TYsir mentioned. You'd get plenty of play time in before you hit it, though.
---
I play DK there is definitely a rotation and combos some skills you level are more powerful than others or apply debuffs or CC. There’s no direct p2p trading it’s all done grouch AH. I suggest it because I think there’s enough content to keep you interested for 3-4 months but when I got to a gear score of 425 upgrades became painfully rare and everything became pretty tedious but before that point it’s very fun. The leveling is cool and the main story like quest is well developed
---
13 year old me was playing a gnome rogue , was kinda good geared and was raiding with that guild for a year atleast . 
---
One day i made contact with the horde premade , after somw days we were like good friends and i decided to make a 2nd account and start lvling a hunter without telling everyone.
---
By that time the alliance guys went full aggro on me because i skipped raids etc.
---
Around the time my hunter got 60 i realised i would need many gold to catch up.
---
So i decided to scam alliance players as much as possible , i asked for some gold in the guild , i scammed random people for enchanting and crafting mats ( on multiple chars).
---
When the guildmaster found out i told him to fuck off and left the guild.
---
I transfered everything on horde side , made like 5k gold.
---
Had like 5 rl friends in the alliance guild and they all got kicked because of me.
---
Insta bought epic mount and silithus rep.
---
I named my pet after my alliance main, and starting headhunting my old guildmates , they tryd to gank me on multiple occasions but i always had my  premade as backup and they had no chance.
---
Forums were full of posts about me , would say i was the most hated player at the time. I felt like a true warchief.
---
Was playing the "red =dead " game for a long time.
---
Now , some years later  , i wouldnt do that again , but i still think it was funny as hell
---
Sorry for hijacking, but how does a druid fair at farming gold? What options do they have to make some money?
---
Maybe I'm in the wrong on this. To me, it doesn't seem like tauren druids were simply added for balance, more because it made total sense. Re-reading the post they do say tauren druids make sense, they guess. Maybe I was just annoyed at the alliance/nelf bias. Maybe I jumped to conclusions. Maybe I'm tipsy.
---
yes, very pedantic.
---
Make my guild with my first saved coppers.
---
Level up level up level up level up level up
---
Warriors are good against priests and warlocks in 1v1, even better if you play undead. But they are mediocre to bad against everything that can kite.
---
Warriors start shining with a healer and windfury on their side.
---
Trust ME, its perfect.
---
It was Greymane or Ysera (I forget which) because I was in the guild right under Exousia named Aurum and I remember the guild Exousia and the warrior Kallozar. I wasn't in the guild so I don't know the exact details, but what I know of Kallozar this seems 100% accurate lol
---
Yeah same here. I played on a private server roughly 1,5 years ago. Was thinking of starting again to fresh up my memory of alliance which I haven't played for ages and planing to play once classic hits. Figured it would be stupid to do though. Better to wait and build up some anticipation and be really pumped for it. If I will level slower and make some mistakes because I didn't play first on a private server does it really matter much? I rather wait.
---
The many of the grinds (such as AP and m+ for titanforge chances) is what you make of it. People often don’t realize they don’t play at the level that maximizing their AP or getting that one piece to roll 5 or 10 ilvl higher will have a significant impact on their performance. They have no chill and burn themselves out. It’s not all Blizzards fault.
---
Logged in yesterday after work to check out Nazjatar, got bored doing the opening quests in about 10 minutes.
---
I doubt we're missing much.
---
How much does that 3% impact you, i ditched it bcs of all the talents that i nesses to waist to get it
---
if i remember correctly, you used to be able to go to the help menu then do 'auto-unstuck' and it would teleport you to a spirit healer
---
You got about everything wrong actually. First off you need tailoring as a lock for hit rating gear soon to come. It is neccessary. Second off shadow priest is indeed the best combo with a warlock period. Don't worry about overlap. Pick any race see if she wants to play undead priest, if not undead rogue
---
How was that different than the gold selling that was happening before the token?
---
Also, relax.  Just a discussion.
---
It's not bugged, melee leeway renders it ineffective is all it is. I'm pretty sure blizzard already said melee leeway was working as intended.
---
&gt;  Otherwise I'm playing Bloodstained quite a bit
---
I hear a lot of good things, but a lot of the people who play this game love the weeb stuff and love the gameboy Castlevania systems. I've seen some footage of the pirate ship prologue with the Cthulu monsters and I can't help but wonder if the game will appeal to someone who loved the classic Dark Gothic fantasy of Symphony of the Night. Gargoyles, werewolves, vampires, mummies, all that good classic stuff.
---
They also aren't using *nearly* the same codebase.
---
Melee range being 12 yards does not sound slightest bit unusual to you?
---
I personally get naked and accept my death
---
It was called Vanilla for years before even a hint of something like classic. I don't really see what your point is when you know full well nobody means VANILLA when they say retail. Just trying to win an argument?
---
Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding
---
Why? How is it relevant? He could be inept and lazy himself, or not, it wouldn't change the accuracy of his statement.
---
Spending the whole day (and more) with 2 friends and even more pizzas in the same room.   
---
Havent done that for over 10 years and even if it's silly, I am totally looking forward to that.
---
Feels like waiting for holiday.
---
The most painful wait of my life
---
Retail brawl: south shore vs tarren mill
---
Log in kind of casually over the first few days, then power through hard on Friday/Saturday and into labor day weekend. No sense taking time off since I'll be on the last weekend of summer hours.
---
I started playing towards the end of TBC and never got a character to max level until Legion 'cause I'm so damn indecisive.
---
Oh my... Lock in those names girls and boys.
---
backsmithing is an awful profession for most people.  get engineering instead
---
Both are and always were DM, you just  shift+left clicked on the dude, if he was lvl 17 you know its dead mines.
---
I thought tailoring was only necessary after ZG? Which isn’t in phase 1? (But I am a total noob so please correct me if I’m wrong)
---
She wants to roll rogue, I was thinking spriest so we could get groups. She wasn’t rolling priest.
---
All of that happened regardless of tokens. WoW just cut the account stealing market by legalizing it. I sold challenge modes in pandaria and wod.
---
I have been playing MTG arena for about half a year but getting burned out on it. Until classic hits I will just play some old games like heroes of might and magic 3 and whatnot. Games you don't have to invest so much in and can you play for like an hour every now and then.
---
Clothadin isn't so tough to kill, though. Getting through Blackrock Mountain in raid gear can be a long process. At least you don't take durability damage from PvP deaths.
---
That was happening in vanilla. My guild sold many runs for gold.
---
Also there will always be scetchy carry services that will do it for real life money.
---
Even in the Vanilla WoW days I used to love flipping through the game manual for the artwork and lore.  They really go into detail in this WC2 book, describing each faction's heroes (Lothar, Gul'dan, Uther, Cho'gall), battles, history, spells, locations, etc.  And each artist signed their work too, so you can see which were done by Metzen, Samwise, etc.  Pretty damn cool.
---
All they would have to do is work out a new rewards system for it. Instead of rewarding people based on just a win and kills. Base it on how long was spent in the arena as well as how much they contributed to their faction. This keeps shitty players on good teams from just going afk to gain the honor. And it keeps good players on shitty teams, rewarded for how THEY play not how their team does. You wouldn’t have to spend any longer in the BG than you want to, because you will still be rewarded accordingly. Reward seekers rushing to get through to the end are what ruined it. But it really takes no skill to hang out in a BG for 45 minutes to reap the benefits of a winning team
---
I mained a priest as well back in the day! I loved the full T2 set.
---
Shit even living on the east coast and playing on an east coast server I still got 150+ back in the day. Now my ping is less than 30 most of the time.
---
It means money/gold. Although if it does mean dick it’s a weird coincidence, I learned that phrase  from a new friend I met on PS4 who is gay. I assumed it was a variation on “let’s get this bread.” I’ll still use it.
---
I said many not all....
---
Jesus fucking Christ use your brain or search
---
It was established I mediately that it won't be in it.
---
Everything you just mentioned happened before tokens even was a thing.
---
This.
---
A duel between Frostadamus and Swifty ended up with Frost's victory; he killed Swifty, but then Swifty auto attacked him in death for double kill.
---
Warriors don't solo well, they can't clear large groups of mobs like a mage, and can't solo dungeon bosses like a hunter. 
---
Plus every time they get hit they take durability which just ends up costing them gold they may not have. 
---
I'll be playing a warrior, but I'll be going herb/alch and my mage alt will be tailoring/herb. I may eventually drop herb on the warrior for engineering once I'm decently wealthy. 
---
All in all, warriors are not a class you really want to farm with unless you are doing 2 man jump runs, or selling your tanking services.
---
Stealth animation is fixed, some pet bugs got fixed, some features like suggest invite or right click report got taken out, and others that I don't remember
---
This is sort of true though. Originally Druids were going to be Nelf only, and Warlock was going to be Horde-locked (maybe only UD, idr). They decided it was too big of a mess to balance and so Lock was added to alliance and Tauren got druids. 
---
Tauren Druid does fit nicely but it factually was a balance decision that prompted it.
---
Ping is a few ms that blizzard can't control. Batching is 200ms which they can control.
---
Imagine if you had zero ping, but they artificially made it 200 on purpose, and then people defend it.
---
Imagine being this jealous of heterosexual males
---
Man I had tried for so long to get those, it was then or never!!
---
Hit level 10
---
For the most part, less than half your gear will ever be mail.
---
And pre-raid, almost none of it.
---
With daggers, you'll get aged core leather gloves in MC and never replace them.  Muggers belt once Dire Maul comes out.  Distracting dagger is alright, but the DPS loss from a blue off-hand doesn't make up for the gains in +dagger.  There's a +dagger helm from green dragons as well.  +dagger from Death's Sting in AQ40.
---
You can get dagger capped, but the other way to look at it, if you're in any sweaty try hard guild, they'll all be human rogues/warriors and they will all wants swords/maces.  So daggers should pretty much be free reign for you on loot.
---
Go through the comments and you'll notice I'm not alone thinking this
---
You're so friendly. Have a good one.
---
Plan is to play the game.
---
What exactly do you envision is going to happen in classic? You like spammin' frostbolt or something? 
---
inb4 mass downvotes--but seriously we all have to acknowledge the draw of classic isn't some kind of cutting-edge gameplay. it's more the overall feel and progression over a long period of time.
---
Honestly go lock. You can pad the meters in AV by shadowburn enemies at 10% and get killing blows. Also huge shadow bolt crits from max range in stalemates get kills. It's awesome to finish an av with like 40 kills 1 death
---
Waiting? I CAN'T JUST WAIT, GIVE IT TO ME NOW REEEEEEEEEE
---
Wouldn't mind if they extended our wait 5 more days just for that sweet 666 :D
---
When it’s repeated day in and day out, it eventually is. Once or twice is fine. This sub are long surpassed that threshold.
---
Resto druid lol, I just travel form spam and run. And if he isn't geared ill just kill him.
---
I played a mage and i was convinced that warlocks were satan.
---
Been avoiding Pserv except the occusional raid with friends, otherwise Underlords, CSGO, DOtA2, life while I still find a reason for it
---
Priapism is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!
---
Have some faith for this particular team who spawned Ragnaros in Elwynn Forest and made a big Omar to follow player events, they're cool imo
---
Oh thanks. I assumed everyone was talking about the controversial layering mechanic.
---
I think I see where you are coming from - with a purely PVE perspective, waiting until you have a full energy bar to land a gouge followed by an immediate backstab. 
---
I guess the tradeoff here is the white damage you will be dealing to the mob vs the damage you will be tanking yourself from the mob hitting you. You may find yourself needing to eat/bandage more often, which would offset the time gained. You could put the spare points into something like lighting reflexes to offset this.
---
Also going down the PVE path - you'd want to invest in improved slice 'n dice at some point. White damage, even with a daggers build, makes up a huge proportion of a rogue's damage, so any way to increase it is a big bonus.
---
You mean the jump macro? That was a fun time. I used it to get all over the place, but my 2 favorites were using it it to log out at the top of the cenarion inn in silithus, and another occasion where the instance servers were fucked. That night when the servers were shitting the bed, the officers were deciding what to do, and a bunch of the rogues cleared the walls in aq40. We landed in white space when we got past them and proceeded to walk around we left the regular instance in the distance and felt like we were 8n the hyperbolic time chamber. Then one of us fell through the world and we went back. Good times.
---
This is excellent
---
Sort out my ui.
---
You can pvp casually as a frost mage too. It just sounds like you like the lock better, so do it
---
If you have a miner alt then you can have some real steady income
---
Which class for paladin do you prefer? 
---
Looking for an extra opinion.
---
I'm going paladin when vanilla release, but I'm not sure if i should go Human or Dwarf.
---
what do you prefer and why?
---
Facts
---
ist simple. multiboxing gives other people an unfair advantage because they pay more. Its the very definition of pay 2 win
---
Useless for what, bleeding edge raiding?
---
You can play literally any spec in Classic and the only people who will care are people who aren't particularly fun to play with.
---
Your Scholo run isn't doomed to fail because you have a feral tank or because you have a boomkin or enhance dps.  Most of the problems those specs have in Classic are itemization, not the spec itself.  BC mostly fixed that, and if they wanted to Blizzard could add new items to the game to address it without having to touch the specs themselves.
---
Escape artist for a warrior is incredible. And on a short CD too (1 min). As long as you don't mind your character and gear looking small.
---
If you plan on playing on a PVP server shadowmeld is very useful and fun though!
---
Battlefield 5 and TBC Private Server
---
He didnt say r/wow was garbage, he said detail WoW was. There is a subreddit for everything. By your logic any criticism against anything is breaking rule 2.
---
I'm planning to make a big post about this issue, but not complain about it
---
It didn't have perfect balance, but it was far more balanced than vanilla. Vanilla pvp balance is a joke, but then again vanilla was intentionally designed as a PVE game that just happened to have the PVP option.
---
Every class in TBC had at least one viable setup.
---
&gt; Ping is a few ms  
---
objectively false 🙂
---
Love the cover art
---
And his fancy "beta access" I bet he wears fancy pants too.
---
Actually its not a bad idea to be honest. A lot of people's class preferences have changed over the years. You can hop on a server and mess around with multiple classes now so you don't end up rerolling a bunch on live servers and put yourself way behind your friends and other people. (This is a problem I have lol)
---
That would be sick. However he’d need system clock access so probs not
---
So I have officially brought my class choices down to 3. (i know, hard enough already!) 
---
With this being said, I thought it would be fun to write down my personal preferences/play style and see if others can guess/persuade me into playing the class they feel best fits my personality!
---
I will be a semi-filthy casual. Work/life nowadays does not allow me to play as much as i used to. ):
---
I enjoy PvE content and look forward to grabbing sweet loot with my friends/guild mates. 
---
I have always done end game content at a decent level, but ever since Arena was introduced, PvE has never been top priority. Considering Classic has no arena, I will be relying on premade BGs/WPvP to entertain me as i've always loved to do them. (probably won't ever hit Rank 14 though!     /cry)
---
My friends and I also have always enjoyed WPvP/PvP in general, including duels. (Top arena rating i've ever achieved was 2600.) 
---
I WILL be camping lowbies during downtime (with moderation) for my own enjoyment of drinking your alt's tears.
---
Will more than likely be Horde, but Alliance is not off the table yet!
---
Gold farming capabilities would be extremely ideal as I will have time constraints every now and then.
---
Do u have a worse pc than you did in 2006 if not u should be fine
---
This is what I was referring to idk I miss not having to grind ap or pray for rng stats to min max correctly it just feels so fake to me in current retail I hear u tho I'm not mad but sub numbers also don't lie either
---
This is the fucking winner here. It is a 100% guaranteed spirit res. I defy you to find someone who would run that.
---
Haha “dps”
---
Youre going to be a nightfall/annihilator drone at best
---
But do you really need more than that one rule?
---
They are putting in pretty much development costs in that project. No way there are just doing it to shut us up. They at least rely on a successful rerelease and are probably hoping for more opportunities in the future (BC etc.).
---
What if he's in China? He literally can't google anything.
---
Nobody will bring a paladin tank to 4HM, don’t spread lies
---
Yeah one of those, there were a few of them that all played together.
---
I played frost mage and paladin through vanilla.  I loved my mage for both pvp and pve- it's a great class. 
---
From what I remember, there were only some circumstances at various stages of the game where one had a dramatic advantage over the other- most of the time they are fairly interchangeable in terms of performance as a dps class. I like the mage play style more personally, but I'd consider rolling a warlock for pvp.
---
Ofc looks doesn’t matter for everyone. If looks doesn’t matter choose whatever for whatever reason (easy mode, hard mode, flair... etc).
---
there's always one typo in these things
---
I gotta learn to reread my stuff
---
I was extremely high and I checked it like 10 times. I still don't trust my own math
---
I originally thought that's what they were going to do when they announced it, it makes a lot of sense.  The way that it works now (in simple terms and obviously not the whole picture as I'm sure other tech people will try to poke holes in this, but it's a bare bones explanation),  the server has one single metadata which holds information such as character names, guild name, level, etc.  They are using load balancing to distribute the traffic between different nodes (layers) on the server to balance population.  My guess is that when you login or create a character, it will place you in the most available / least active node; this continually balances the amount of active users across each node to evenly spread out the distribution.  When the population of all nodes on this single server starts to decrease over time (the assumption by Blizz), then they can remove one layer and have it spread traffic across the remaining layers, over and over until only one layer remains.
---
Using your example, server A has 5 layers (1-5). Assume all layers are currently at 0 pop for simplicity.  5,000 people login and the load balancer spreads the users out over the 5 layers, trying to get 1,000 users in each layer.  It likely does not fill layer 1 to the max it can hold and then spill over to layer 2 as some people were mentioning in other threads, that has the result of making one layer packed and the other layer empty; load balancers by design get rid of that issue.  If we take the 3,000 users per server number from the vanilla days, ultimately the goal is for each layer to have around 3,000 users (15,000 total per server).  Then, over time, when the active daily users goes down to let's say, 12,000, then they can remove layer 5 and spread those users over 4 layers mimicking the same # of users they had before but with a fewer number of layers.  The server only has one metadata, one collection of objects, so it is easy to remove one node and just spread the connections across the remaining nodes.  This process continues on and on (removing layer by layer over time) until the number of active users is roughly 3,000 and they can just have all active users on one layer, one server.
---
This setup ultimately has a lot of exploitable mechanics such as being able to layer hop easily with joining the party of another user on a different node.  As we have seen from some of the videos posted here, this can cause a lot of gameplay issues.  Technically it is probably the easiest setup however..  we use load balancers for our business intelligence tools all the time, they are quite common and straight forward to setup.  There is some integration with the application itself, of course, but the concept is simple.  It solves the problem of actively rebalancing traffic across one server without the need to have multiple servers, multiple metadata databases, and by default it avoids "dead" servers.  I am with you that allowing people to pick a layer within a server (and treat it like an individual server) would be much better.  I guess they are trying to take away the issue of people complaining that they are on the same "server" as their friend/guild, etc. but they cannot see them in game; or people complaining that their "server" is dead and they picked the wrong one, so they have to start over (even though we know that they will eventually merge).  I think their decision is ultimately based on a messaging/communication issue (and keeping it as simple as possible) rather than a technical issue.  Just my 2c.
---
The meta for wsg and av bgs revolves more around control and ability to 1v1 than top dmg. Warrior might fit that top dmg role since you would be mid killing efc and those trying to cross. As rogue you would be guarding and staying on efc. As mage you would be sheeping a lot so dmg would be gimped. This is the meta as it was in vanilla to consider although it could be slightly changed now.
---
One of the things I’ve considered is the sheer amount of time saved in corpse runs with wisp 😂😂
---
Struggling to get into Borderlands.  Yet everyone raves about it. What am I missing (apart from Classic) ?
---
Thank you!
---
Must be some Korean K pop game. It couldn't possibly be a version of wow.... Could it? ☹️
---
But Classic will not be running on that same client.
---
Yeah if you are unsure what class you will play then it's a good idea. I'm set though on what I will play so no need for me to try classes out.
---
It will be graphically harder to run due to some updates in graphics, but because of various fixes and optimization it should be easier for your CPU which is usually the part that struggles with wow.
---
Objectively true. I didn't give any specific number.
---
The point isn't about how much ms ping is. Its about ensuring any form of ms ping or otherwise is kept as low as possible. What you're saying is because ping exists it's therefore OK to add another 200ms window ontop of that even though modern architecture can be far far more accurate.
---
My point is it should be as low as is even possible, and the only argument against that is if you want the game to be inaccurate on purpose.
---
No you won’t, you won’t be tanking in naxx because you have no taunt and will make not near enough threat.
---
It will go to warriors first, then warrior tanks, then hunters and then maybe the useless retri being carried
---
For clarification the range check that determines if an attack goes through is server side ofc. What is client side is the skill icon showing red or white and this includes leeway mechanics.  
---
If you modify the leeway values in the LH core, the distances at which the icons become red will remain the same, since that information is hardcoded in the client.    
---
You can open up the client in a decompiler and search for 2.66f to find the actual code for it.
---
What's your class?
---
Not an argument in the least, unless you count providing information an argument somehow. Just pointing out that despite what we call it colloquially, it doesn’t change what the games are (or will be) in reality.
---
I play a human warlock so either UD rogues or orc shamans.
---
Maybe he wants to change classic to whatever the f that is.
---
As an undead warrior, paladin. Not really intimidating, just annoying. You essentially had to kill them 3-4 times and usually another alliance player would stroll by and help them out since it takes 5 minutes to kill a pally.
---
Farming shards isn't THAT bad, and why not do it the day before you need them and log out with a full bag so you're good to go? Seems like a silly reason to skip on the class if you like it. If spamming SB or FB sounds dull, then take another look at hunter and just understand you're utility after BWL. If you're a high attender, hit capped, do your rotation well, have consumables,  you're gonna get a spot.
---
Horde, DM = Dire Maul
---
Isn’t 8.2 just standard blizzard making the previous expansions content redundant and going off on another massive tangent?
---
I'll remember that for sure (paragraphs)
---
But about the layering, what I'm saying is, imagine the beta is staying that way to keep the gameplay flow as well as possible for people to encounter other bugs? Sure they're not telling us that, but if we don't wait for the result of that, we're crying wolf for literally nothing.
---
I'm saying two weeks before launch not to just start freaking out, but to have a real big reaction to this. Cause we're two months away. 
---
Now we both agree on that, 100%: We NEED communication. There is a lack of information that allows for this unconstructive criticism to exist, but even then we should behave like normal humans and wait for communication before talking shit.
---
I’ve been doing my research and have played retail WoW off and on since TBC. I have 0 Classic experience. 
---
That being said, I’m a huge fan of the retail Windwalker play style. I imagine the closest to that will be the Rogue but getting a second opinion.
---
What class how I play? (Horde) 🤔
---
I feel like originally troll Druids would make more sense. Not in a lore way, just in a Blizzard deciding which race to give it to way.
---
it doesnt matter how good they are, games with decent teams wont last long enough for them to be summoned in the first place. even if both sides would push every bunker, tower and gy both sides will end up at eachothers base before the resources are even gathered to start the event. besides a bit less threat(the parry) and a bit less damage wont magicly turn them into litle Kazzaks or Emerald dragons destroying everything in their path.
---
I think you are horribly underestimating players motivation to farm out reputation and honor aswel. endless stalemates arent fun, in 2019 ppl are far more objective driven.
---
Wallpaper engine is able to do this. i have a background that changes based on your system clock.
---
Playing with friends helps but honestly the game gets way more fun the more talents you have, imo. 
---
I really just like the dialogue of the characters and the random shit enemies say cracks me up. The humor isn’t for everyone as it is very vulgar potty humor so that may turn some folks off. Once you get to the main city the game picks up. The DLC is some of the best content too and you can do those at any time.
---
If I had the time to actually run a guild, I would find a way to implement a call system my old guild used for 20 man groups.
---
At least in the 20 mans (numbers would have to be adjusted for main raids) you would get two "calls" for loot. It could be two different items or the same item twice. If something drops, anyone who called it gets to roll and if you were the only one who called, its yours. If you call something more than once, you get that many rolls vs others. 
---
This not only made it kind of fair, it was self regulated. The way we did it back then was to put the items in your Ventrilo notes. So you could plan your calls around others if you chose and bank on something dropping no one else wanted so you would get it 100%. 
---
So like, increase to 3 or 4 or something and it should at least work in MC and BWL. I am not sure beyond that. The thing that makes it work is people are encouraged to spread out their needs in order to get more stuff. If you choose to compete heavily on something you know the risks.
---
No one has ever been enough of a sicc fugg to run the entirity of Dire Maul in one sitting.
---
Add Ravasaur Mount quest please! Its lack is making my symmetry disorder go nuts.
---
I think he was talking about a warrior you know, a *Tank*
---
So you're just gonna go in circles. Okay.
---
For me, when I think about Tauren, they make the best Warriors in terms of their asthetics, lore, etc...  Just a big bully with a large weapon.  If i was playing a warrior then Tauren would be my #1 choice.  I literally cannot bring myself to play a Tauren as any other class though.
---
Finish the starting area quests in a timely manner.
---
They are, except it's not meant to stay in the game, we just lack information about this but layering is just being tested, people are freakin out for nothing this early into the beta
---
Have you tried Dota? The lack of last hitting and other gameplay mechanics that made ARTS games popular made HotS feel unrewarding to play. It feels like a fanservice deathmatch game. Some people like that I guess. I found it boring as hell.
---
the economy was destroyed when it came out, achievements were always useless and whatever toxicity you claim happened is in your head.
---
Carry runs always existed the only difference was now that gold actually had a meaning with previously golds only worth was buying fucking mounts.
---
But no classic won't have tokens.
---
oh boy, I'll remember forever our nefrian kill that got me the amazing robe of transcendence!! what a moment!!!
---
I'm not a fan of the weeb stuff, but I admit it's fun at least. They didn't go full weeb, thankfully. It 1000% still appeals to the Dark Gothic aspect. It's in there in several places. It's incredibly overall VERY similar and has MANY odes to SOTN. It's like SOTN, but somehow actually better 2 times over. Character-wise, SOTN is still my favorite. You can actually customize your main character a bit too, and retain even more of the Dark Gothic or really almost any other theme you want with them.
---
Same. Such a great game. It's scratching my roleplaying game itch.
---
sou you'd be ok with Blizzard GM's just handing out legendaries to random people? I mean trash players would still be trash in PvE and PvP right?
---
You know they're remastering FF8, check it out. Was one of my favorites.
---
Yeah that’s mostly the problem idd. Allright, gues I’ll be fine than. Thank you!
---
&gt; Plus Fall rules. ~~Turkey, Halloween, Football, long sleeve tee shirts~~. What's not to like?
---
Leveling to 60, world pvp, dungeons with friends, molten core. FTFY
---
Rogue / druid could be fun. Since you can both stealth &amp; someone can heal when things inevitably go wrong
---
The content is fresh, but within an hour or so back to generic world quests. I'll agree the zone looks beautiful and there was a killer cutscene, but that's it. 
---
My only goal is to unlock flying and leech off my retail guild to see the new raid in heroic. 8.2 will be easy to quit in a couple weeks. Nothing I've seen in 8.2 fixes the underlying core problems the game has.
---
&gt; If he outrolls you on his first raid......you are rightly going to think "Whats the fucking point?"
---
To be fair, this can and does happen even in a DKP system. The guild I joined after my story had MC-BWL and  up to Princess H on farm in AQ40, so needless to say my barely MC geared ass got loot FAST, in fact within the first week of me raiding with them I got super lucky and got 3 pieces of Nightslayer gear that I was missing, the dagger from Vael and a few other items (and I wasn't rolling against anyone because they all had this stuff and there was only one other rogue at the time). 
---
So, come the next week another rogue who played maybe 1 once or twice a month logged on and came to BWL with us. The Bloodfang belt dropped and because I had negative DKP the person who only raided 1-2 times a month got it. 
---
Again, there's probably and "easy fix" to this as well, but then again there's just too many things wrong with DKP and I've just personally have had too many bad things happen with it for me to want to roll with a guild that uses that kind of system. 
---
I'm actually talking with a few people IRL about making a guild where the class officers are democratically elected by members of their own class and are the ones that distribute loot via loot council. It's fair, it's democratic and the second they make a mistake the class can recall their position of class officer/loot distributor at anytime. Still working out all the kinks but this seems to be the most fair method to me.
---
Hehe I defenitly not have a pc worse than I did in 2006!
---
Or paladin. I understand now.
---
Look at the video. Front group of 2 popping Nifty's at the exact same time. Now you don't know, but these guilds were among the top on the alliance side, so having good comms is a must.
---
/u/hypocritical_oath explained it far better than me in another thread.
---
&gt;It's network compensation... Has nothing to do with hardware and software it's about your computer communicating with their server, and how long that takes.
---
&gt;As such you need a bit of leeway cause sending those messages takes time. But the amount of time it takes has plummeted since 2005, so we're seeing lag compensation mechanics meant for 2005 internet on 2019 internet.
---
Check the dozens of other posts like this. You are trying to log on to the stress test, which is over for now. They will do more later.
---
You can’t assure anyone of any Blizzard action.
---
+1 for LoL. Especially worth it if you have some background in MOBAs. Kinda taxing for new players tho.
---
da wildhammer clan tho!
---
As of right now, hunter is really broken. They will most likely fix most of the issues before launch considering it's still 2 months away but I would keep an eye on any changes they make.
---
That being said, even if hunter weren't broken, shaman is OP in BGs so if you legitimately want to one shot people I'd go with that.
---
Well, the entire game doesn't revolve around raiding like it does in modern WoW, so it isn't like you're spamming Frostbolt *all the time*. You'll definitely use more of your class kit when you're out pvping, grinding rep, doing dungeons, gold farming etc.
---
When people say their class plays like shit in BFA, they're talking about how literally every single spec feels the exact same. Typically, you'll keep up 1 or 2 dots (moonfire/corruption/SW:Pain/flame shock), you'll spam your filler to generate some kind of resource (wrath/shadowbolt/mindflay/lightning bolt/crusader strike), you'll dump your resource (astral surge/unstable affliction/mind blast/lava burst/templar's verdict). 
---
These are just some very few examples - obviously, each class has different cooldowns and maybe an extra "unique" ability, typically just spammed on CD every 15/30/60 seconds. Cataclysm really screwed up by removing all "non-primary-specialization" abilities (no fireball for frost mages, no immolate for aff locks) - Legion made *some* steps in the right direction, but BFA just took another 10 steps backwards.
---
The best thing to do is stockpile arcanite for when a new phase comes out. I remember I had a bunch of bars saved up and when the tier 0.5 quests came out I was able to unload them at a very good price due to demand. Finally got my epic mount as a result.
---
May have to jump back in and try again.
---
Sub rogue...
---
Also have MM hunter and Shadow priest (this one mostly for PvP).
---
What about the cast animation that played when your poisons procced? Is that still in? Big part of vanilla 4 me.
---
Funny you mention that. I had never played witcher before and just picked it up. What an amazing game.
---
Play hunter
---
You are correct. You don’t need tailoring until phase 3. He is correct about priest though. Warlock and priest have some pretty insane synergy. A lock with a healer can pretty much never stop pulling. For a warlock health = mana and with a healer that means nearly infinite mana and health. Also shadow weaving when you are higher level. Shadow priest talent that boosts all shadow damage dealt to the target. Makes warlock stronger
---
Aside from how accurate it is, it's also great comedy!
---
Layering seems smart in early levels. There are plenty of places where having a lot of people around is going to make quest completion impossible. Places where you have to kill a specific named mob or click a certain item. Turns into huge piles of people all waiting and scrambling.
---
I'm not a big raider or melee player for that matter, but my understanding is hit cap for melee is 8% 2H and that's the most important stat -period- over crit, AP, Str etc.
---
So it depends on your gear.  If you're just starting out and don't have 8% Hit on your gear then Precision is massive.  Though, it always has value because once you achieve cap, Precision would enable you to replace Hit gear with more damage gear.
---
&gt; if your melee attack **started while the target was in range**, it would still complete even if the target moved slightly out of range before the swing landed. What we're seeing here is just a flat added range to moving players *and* NPCs, which was added expansions later. 
---
thank you! this seems to be the point that is lost in every thread on leeway.
---
Phones these days are more powerful than computers at Vanilla's release. You should be able to run classic without much worse.
---
After finishing the books i just finished metro exodus. Also playing detroit become human
---
That is simply not true. Paladins are the best 5 man tanks in the game, they can't tank raids is all.
---
There was one specific cave that was far worst than all others. It was in SE Ashenvale, and there was a quest to kill 3 insane neutral druids in there. It was deep, there were multiple levels, many rooms, weird bridges that allowed access to some of the areas, that you could see but never reach, and just overall confusing as all hell. It was even hard to complete following detailed turn-by-turn directions on wowhead.
---
Whenever I got that quest, that's where the chain ended for me.
---
The whole world ? DM is litteraly the best place to farm thanks to pathing.
---
DM : you can do it ALONE, reset dungeon, safe place without competition(ally or enemy faction) for the mobs etc..
---
Tribute Run is the best because the golds income    
---
does not depend on the economy.
---
And, don't forget that rich players won't be inclined to play with the other because they can just buy everything. It'll affect community too.
---
And thank god for that. CS:GO isnt bad, but 1.6 is just better.
---
People right off hunter for their damage falling off in Naxx. What you need to ask yourself is - are you actually going to be raiding T3?
---
That’s my point, you don’t HAVE to unless you are at a high end where it’s expected. Players put that expectation on themselves. The AP gained from normal play is generally enough to keep you close enough to perform well.
---
Boss kills bruh
---
Yeah I hadn’t thought of Druid but you’re right - hadn’t thought of it, cheers!
---
West side of Un'Goro Crater was always a pain as it only had one GY in the far East.
---
&gt; private server thing
---
Sure, but an important thing most non pirate server players forget is that pirate server players are also people.
---
What is the confusion? Retail players like mobas and dungeon crawlers. Us classic heads are cut from hardcore rpg elements. We play games for worldly rpg elements, and grew up playing shit basically forged by dnd nerds. We dont pick up games for "action mechanics" alone, rpg fans like living breathing worlds, interaction with the world and danger. Pretty simple. I dont fuck with retail WoW because its not an rpg and rpgs is what i play. If i want fast paced action where reaction time wins, im an fps head. Simple for me.
---
I don't remember their names, but on TB it was a woman and her 3-4 kids, the youngest of which was named Bobby. In BC the guild splintered over a BoE nature resist chest.
---
I won't down vote you because this is a common post, fun is subjective and you base your opinions on the vocal minority. Soon, hopefully, you'll understand why people play games, and have passion for certain things. 
---
Weather people see wow as something they grew up with that has always been there, ever changing with them, or maybe they like collecting pets or doing anything they can to get a mount, because they're completionists. Maybe they like raiding, which is fine because they release raid content that's fun to a lot of people. Maybe they like pvp and trying new silly builds or just causing people problems (happened in classic too).
---
In the end, people complaining about there nothing to do in wow currently, or it's too easy, etc, probably haven't cleared endgame, racked up half a mill hks, got r1, collected most pets or mounts, completed every quest or finished piecing together transmog sets. Why haven't they done this? Maybe it's not fun to them, but it's fun to a lot of people still.
---
Play both games, or don't, but in the end don't try and justify other people's fun, because they're 2 games that are on a different part of the same spectrum.
---
This is just wrong. The spec requirements for Classic are closer to, if not identical, to Retail.
---
Does it matter? Virtually all classes can do enough DPS to raid, have self-heals, AoE, an energy mechanic or infinite mana, free respect, and can solo elites no problem.
---
They couldn’t not be more homogeneous.
---
&gt; The team comes first.
---
That's my attitude towards this and why it was so hard for me to let this go. My discussion with the guild officers/leaders went something like this 
---
Me: Ok, so let's say that (hunter main) has to get on his hunter because we need him to do something, but we gave all the loot to his rogue alt, because of this we're going to be doing less damage because the guy's rogue main doesn't have the gear to do the best damage possible because it's all been hoarded by someone's alt
---
Officers: but he has the DKP for it, we understand it's not fair but he'll get the loot eventually if he keeps raiding with us
---
Me: and so will the guys alt, but why not gear up mains first so that we as a group have a better chance of succeeding?
---
Them: that's just how DKP works, sorry but there's nothing we can do. 
---
that was it in a nutshell, but dragged out over the course of a week or so.
---
Always happy to hear your voice piping up with a thoughtful consideration of the issues in the community! Thanks Josh!
---
Tauren druids do make sense :) More than gnomes anyway.
---
I’m not saying I’m offended or anything by it. But I can see why it could wear thin with others. It’s like the guy that comes into work on Monday and immediately asks “is it Friday yet?” every single Monday. Eventually, no matter how innocuous and innocent, it can get annoying to some people.
---
Blizz employees
---
Reupload?  I wouldn't be mad.  :p
---
Raiding naxx and AQ40 - just did a shogun 2 campaign (Chosokabe).
---
Tried rome 2 but it’s still garbage.
---
Can’t get into Witcher 3 but I might give it a go again
---
Class identity
---
&gt;Any questions?
---
Naw man. Pretty spot on.
---
spamming rotations no matter how intricate is not exciting 
---
Its just a quicker way to get carpal tunnel.   
---
I say this as someone who was top DPS on my server.   
---
You wan't excitement try solo enchanter EQ 1999. Suck in those balls as making the wrong decision = death.  Modern wow could literally contain a keyboard that you roll your race on and experience 99% of content.
---
Mage is probably the best class in the game overall. You will never feel like you made a mistake picking one.
---
Imp also runs out of mana really fast
---
I would sign up to TBC but not wrath. I think a lot of players would agree.
---
8.2 was definitely steps in the right direction. I just hope 8.3/9.0 continue to take steps in the same direction. 
---
We don't want modern WoW to suck - in a perfect world, both Classic and modern WoW thrive and have their own plentiful playerbases.
---
Yea, I got you. Needs to be a "visually fun" for me, otherwise I'll end up frustrated.
---
Between humans and gnomes, I would probably pick gnome because humans feels a bit dull to me. As a fantasy game, I would pick a race with a bit more "flavour".
---
Between undeads and trolls, I would pick undead because of the animations.
---
Im also interested about the Factions distinctions. I dont know much about Alliance Cities and their benefits... I read that ppl find Alliance cities more "polished", is that right?
---
My mom played a belf rogue in BC and loved ganking lol
---
If its not an rpg it can go fuck itself lol
---
Main objectives will be to;
---
1. Get at least one 6 slot bag (maybe 2 if i'm lucky to get a drop) 
---
2. get my fem orc rogue to Undercity to train swords and pick up the flight path
---
3. get as close to level 10 as possible
---
4. start mining and skinning
---
5. get me and my friends to the Barrens (uniting our group of undead, tauren, trolls and orcs into one zone) so that on day 2 the real fun can begin.
---
Why do you feel the need to defend them for free? I'm genuinely curious.
---
Clicking the box does not entitle you to an invite.
---
If your computer cannot run Modern/Retail WoW,  it will not be able to run Classic.
---
They said in May that they have drastically reduced the amount of invitations going out. They may consider doing more later, but they may not. 
---
To be blunt: there are millions of people with the same qualifications as you, so your chances are almost zero.
---
Hmm, I could have worded that more clearly. I was specifically thinking of item loss/corpse runs, where you could permanently lose something that was rare and hard to get. AFAIK, only Everquest and combat MUDs did that.
---
You seem to underestimate the ammount of damage 3 months of layering will cause to the long term economy of the game. Which is really important to vanilla, since it seems you did not experience it - It's as important as end game content (raids) itself.
---
Yes, their mana issues are THAT bad. Shaman is worth it because you can still raid as 30/0/21 though, whereas spriests are much tougher to get a spot, take up 4 debuff slots, and there is maybe 1 of them...but you could also heal as shadow if your RL is OK with it and you're slamming FH and pots constantly because your other spells are too slow as shadow.  Ele shaman is better for group pvp, shadow is better for 1v1. You're gonna drink a metric fuckton of water with either one of them so make friends with mages.
---
Naw dude. Just legalize murder. It happens all the time anyway. Who cares! 
---
Alright murder was a bit much. Legalize robbing convenience stores. Kids take stuff from them all the time.
---
I am actually quite similar only a warlock and a year or two older. Progressing BWL was the best gaming experience in my life.
---
Not realistic. This guy has fitting gear and doesn't look like a clown.
---
I can’t tell you exactly how it will run on your system, but what I can tell you is that it takes far less resources than BFA. If you can play BFA, you can run Classic on the same settings and get better performance.
---
I played BFA back and forward from it's release and always quit again due to it being boring. But from the hours I got since the update it seems like they did an update in the right direction at least. But it's literally the first drop to fill that glass.
---
No new beta invites are planned between now and release in late August. That may change but don’t plan on it. I believe only about 3,000 people got beta access. There are only 2 servers, one pvp and one pve, both are fairly dead since the level cap has been 40 for weeks
---
I’ve never played anything but a warrior and and a healer priest ! Mostly will be playing solo so thought try a hunter ? My peak was wrath clearing all heroic content without Lich king buff , which was fun , who thinks hunter is a decent shout for solo ???
---
Reduce leeway distance and make spell batching 200 ms instead of the current 400 ms. Then we have a far more balanced and enjoyable gameplay and it will increase the skill ceiling significantly as well, while still preserving the core of vanilla gameplay.
---
But yeah that would be changes from original vanilla, so get out the pitchforks.
---
I think you have to have BFA. Don't quote me on that though.
---
Beta access has just been given to a selected few. Some random and some targeted.
---
Blizzard makes great cutscenes. They are cheesy as hell, but they are consistantly good. The last 3 expansions I just YouTube them and skipped the $180 a year to play.
---
Unrelated but you probably know. My friend and I started playing a pserver and he’s a dwarf priest. He just dinged 20 and is already talking about “having to only use mouse to move because he needs wasd to keybind to spells” am I crazy in thinking he’s being way too much of a try hard? Like lvl 20 bro

I've actually been a horde main all my life and I'm way more PvP oriented. 
---
I was trying to remain as impartial as I could.
---
I think your confused.
---
 Yeah it's true you do spam spells, but it has consequences. If you go Oom in classic, you are essentially fucked. It makes clearing dungeons, and pulling trash interesting. 
---
Also gear drops at early levels makes a difference, and especially late game. Raid progression is even more difficult, when you get to certain bosses that are immune to your fire or frost spells, which makes certain classes have advantages/weaknesses. 
---
Theres no need to downvote what you are saying. It's just classic wow had an understanding of balance/weaknesses, where as retail doesn't. If you put your time into a class that is stronger than most, then I'm sure you are enjoying BFA. But for those who played feral druids, ele shamans, enhance etc.... at the start, and then never got proper buffs, or class reworks. Well then, the game becomes pointless.
---
&gt; We know that parry is wrong on pservers (and it's undertuned)
---
It's not "undertuned" - implying conscious decision. It's what Nost devs was correct based on their reading of code.
---
And it is no secret that Vanilla private servers are overtuned to simulate the nostalgic difficulty people who were 8 yeard old at the time thought it was. Nostalrius devs themselves admitted it at some point or another.
---
Frankly, it is now so widely known, by pirate players and this subreddit community that you being on this subreddit and not knowing that is kind of shocking.

Warlock isn't nearly as strong as hunter in phase 1 and 2. Hunter with no gear absolutely 100% better than lock with no gear.

Are you gonna solo on warlock and then level an alt with your SO? If that's why you're not too fond of the idea of spriest because of the resemblance to warlock, then I'd suggest druid or shaman/paladin. Would give you the ability to heal for easier dungeons like you said and they aren't casters like your warlock. Like someone else said, druid+rogue could be fun for duo stealth.
---
does the blood craze proc actually heal enough to offset the crit damage you would take? (if it works). either way, never bothered with any of that malarkey leveling my tauren or gnome warrior back in the day. after you do some instances, you should have enough blues to be able to do decent damage on mobs and not have to eat. i would maybe bandage every now and then but downtime was minimal. as a lowbie warrior, you're still not gonna be able grind multiple mobs at a time or even mobs 2 levels higher than you due to your gear and not being full specced. just have to pick your fights.
---
Literally same. Then unsubbed after a month of legion
---
Depends on how bad the tank is. If they're so bad that it would be faster to go back to a capital city and spam for a new one then sure. Otherwise, better to keep your mouth shut unless you want to stay in the dungeon for even longer than if they had just stayed.
---
I wanted to make the case for more Alliance Warlocks. First the obvious points:
---
* Easy Leveling
---
* Free Mount
---
* Most desired class for Alliance raids
---
* Scales extremely well with gear
---
* Low skill floor / High skill ceiling in pvp
---
* Dropping Inferno on people then watching them panic
---
* No drinking if played correctly
---
* Some of the largest crits in the game
---
* Having a paladin that can BoP you will make the horde rage
---
Now about WotF and Tremor totem. The two most popular classes for forsaken are Rogue and Mage. Mages are free kills for you. If you are spec'd SL, you felhunter can basically solo them. Also as SL, rogues probably won't bother even engaging you. Tremor totem works on pulses. Meaning that if you create a macro to target then wand/pet attack, you can probably fear THEN kill the totem before it pulses and removes the fear. All things considered, the advantages for horde are there, but are all very surmountable. 
---
Some people say forsaken warlocks are the most evil race/class combo. To them I present the gnome warlock. Checkmate.
---
What I did,  alts were not allowed unless that person made an official change from alt to main and IF it was what the team had a need for OR it did not hurt us.  Want to bring an alt?  Have an alt guild raid night.  Everyone can bring one.
---
Dark Souls 1. Just cleared Anor Londo.

I just refresh because the circle jerk in this sub gives me some weird kind of pleasure.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I'm 100% with you on Kodo mounts. Their 100% run animation looks so damn goofy.
---
Yeah rogue would be your best bet and hunter would be a close a second.
---
Yeah I’m leaning towards that for sure now. And yes, I thought spriest would be too close (though I’ve always wanted to run one ever since vanilla - shadow form is just too cool)
---
The scenario you desribed is perfectly fair and I don't see any issue with it.  You got a bunch of loot, therefore you were -DKP.  He didn't get any of that loot (because he wasn't there) so he got the next good thing that dropped.
---
He got it because either nobody else wanted it or because other people DID want it, but had gotten lots of other loot beforehand.
---
I don't see how you viewed this as a negative thing.  It's exactly how DKP works and the reason so many guilds used it is because it was fair.
---
With random rolling you end up with potentially one person never getting an item and somebody getting everything.  With "Loot Council" situations the same thing can happen.
---
DKP avoids these situations all together.  It rewards players for time invested and means you cant hog all the loot.  As long as certain restrictions are put in place to stop people hoarding points, its by FAR the best system.
---
Alright, that's lovely. Why are you calling it Toxic then? Much like Nazi, the word Toxic has been diluted to the point where you are saying that people calling retail shit is toxic. It used to mean teenagers in game chats calling each other N\*\*\*ER and shit. Actual toxicity. Not this, "annoying" stuff.

Go back to retail if that is your mindset. Classic wasn’t about getting honor and it sure as hell wasn’t about being optimal. You played AV to lay waste to opposite faction scum. Stalemates were fun because you got to put down enemy players and show you were better. This is why you private server players aren’t ready for what will come with classic. People want to relive their classic experience not min max and que dodge all day. This AV is the shit version of the true AV so the games will still be quick, but if you think for a second people won’t be duking it out in the field of strife you’re wrong.

Orc MS Warrior with R14 or quivalent gear. Doable with cooldowns but you cold never rely on stuns so very inconvenient for paladins.

---
No thanks.  I'll occupy myself with Bloodstained or Total War Warhammer II instead for the next 2 months.
---
Magram and Gelkis are by far the most important
---
loads of people still fighting it out in Italy my dude
---
It's a good complaint on retail wow, but I fail to see how that complaint sheds favorable light on Classic, where everything was *even worse than that*. 
---
I also don't see how removing fireball from frost mages and vice versa affects gameplay in a rotation sense. Like, you weren't using those spells anyway. It affected the game in the sense of, you mage now doesn't feel like a complete mage. But it never affected the way you played in raids. 
---
The main reason cramming all spells only into their specific spec was a bad idea is basically like the reason behind why trading card games produce cards that are obviously bad and useless. Because *knowing* that they are obviously bad and *knowing* not to use them is part of being skilled at the game. Having the game sense to know not to do that makes the player feel good, and creates a learning experience for newer players. The biggest condemnation of the new spec theory is basically that it lacks this stepping stone of mastery. Everything is laid out for you, there's even a page that tells you what to do when you spec into it. Your class has one AOE spell and that's what you do for AOE. and so on. It's all very obvious. Whereas before you had a huge toolbox and had to figure it out.  n.b. none of this matters for experienced players as they already know what to do. this post is about normal players getting to play around and experiment with their toolbox rather than having everything labeled and locked in. 
---
none of that has anything to do with DJCzerny's complaint that his 'class is still shit to play,' since for people not progressing along those stepping stones of learning, their class will be *even more shit to play* in classic.
---
To be fair, despite being a massive fan of BC, releasing with SSC and TK as well as Kara, Gruul and Mag is kinda irrelevant.  You weren't getting much done in either T5 raid without a healthy portion of your raid having T4 gear, and SSC (and maybe even TK, I don't really remember) was buggy as shit and needed hotfixes ASAP once guilds like Nihilum were clearing bosses.
---
Ah yes, I’ve definitely looked into hunter as well.

People who booked the week of the 26th off might burn all of Irvine to the ground if this happened.
---
Roll a druid with her rogue.  You can tank to get groups and double stealth for wpvp/dungeon farming etc and you can flex to heal in a pinch.
---
Let's bow our heads and remember the haters.  The ones who kept yelling:
---
**Blizzard will never have Classic servers so quit asking,  it it will never happen you idiots**
---
Those same guys are now saying...it's rose colored glasses and people will hate it.
---
If you like healing, easy pick - paladin. All 3 are good in pvp, Hunter shines in world pvp and if you like pet micro its a clear good choice. Mage are great utility and burst damage. Mage pulls ahead in pve dps and is generally more wanted for raiding.
---
But Overall pick what you think is most fun.
---
Not second-guessing what character I ended up making and creating another one. And another one. And another one...
---
Rocket league but I’ve been playing a lot of pserver the last week or so. Need to cool off it as too not get burnt out. The fortunate thing is my SO saw me playing and wanted to try :) she made a NE hunter and is utter garbage but she’s seeing it as something we can do together which is true and also might give me a free pass to play come late August
---
Just started Sekiro
---
"BOTC" Big ole...
---
As a mage, warlock.  Honorable mentions for shadow priests, marksman hunters and goddamn shamans with windfury procs and grounding totems.
---
VC=VanCleef=DeadMines
---
DM=Dire Maul
---
bully?! taruens are a noble race of honourable warriors! just note that as a tauren, you get burned down fast as you're the biggest target on the map and easiest to click on. size is a disadvantage lol
---
I just ran it last night. We died twice due to agroing extra mobs that were 44+, but there are no packs of seven or eight mobs, except the scorpions, which are non elite. Pretty sure we could have beaten it, but there was no loot for us on the last boss.
---
Similar issue happened to me in vanilla - died near tanaris(or “darn assistant” according to auto correct) - ended up in felwood.
---
Walked the entire distance thinking - at least I get to see a preview of the zones and perhaps meet some ghosts. 
---
 No ghosts to be seen. 
---
After about 1 hr or so I finally arrived to find my body had left the entire world it “fallen through the map”.
---
Was very mad.
---
Maybe you need to reply to the guy I replied to instead of me. You're basically just echoing my point.
---
Weirdly unrelated reply but cool.
---
Imagine seeing "LFG DM" in Westfall chat, shift clicking the player's name, seeing they're level 19, and assuming they must be talking about Dire Maul.
---
I will be converting all of my month 1 ore into bombs so that i can throw them at the alliance.
---
I think 'your' confused. this dude is specifically talking about class gameplay, i.e. rotations. 
---
None of what you said--going oom, gear mattering, bosses being immune to fire spells--has anything to do with what he said or my criticism of it
---
What is the confusion? Retail players like mobas and dungeon crawlers. Us classic heads are cut from hardcore rpg elements. We play games for worldly rpg elements, and grew up playing shit basically forged by dnd nerds. We dont pick up games for "action mechanics" alone, rpg fans like living breathing worlds, interaction with the world and danger. Pretty simple. I dont fuck with retail WoW because its not an rpg and rpgs is what i play. If i want fast paced action where reaction time wins, im an fps head. Simple for me. All the retail people who complain about classics grind aren't rpg fans - even single player rpgs usually push over 200 hours to either max stats or finish lore.
---
are they though? they weren't even important enough to get their own squares
---

I remember the time we killed Jindo the Hexer and both the evil eye and healing mace dropped. I rolled 94 and 95 and won both.

what my handsome brother over here said. deadmines? is that where you want us to throw alliance corpses?
---
First off, I enjoyed this conversation even though it is petty and meaningless. 🙂  
---
But since you don't seem to understand that:  
---
1. Objectivity doesn't mean much when it comes to most of the arguments being made here  
---
2. Ignoring other people's arguments doesn't make you right  
---
3. Accurate/fair games are not necessarily fun, or generate money  
---
--  
---
I just wanted to see if I could get you to see the issue in a different light, since Blizzard will most likely keep spell-batching in the game, and you can seethe about it on your own all you like. I won't be commenting on this anymore though.
---
I'm not saying its good or bad, but it's just ignorant when I see "8.2 sucks fuck retail!" when most of this sub hasn't even played it. 
---
They're the same people that look at any new "competing" game and just say it sucks without any research or supporting information... Like the people that say the new FF14 expansion or patch or whatever is complete trash. (Really? Have you played it? *Do you even have the game?*)
---
Definitely to meme with the boys^
---
&gt; It's like SOTN, but somehow actually better 2 times over. 
---
#Big if true. 
---
I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet and try it myself.
---
Investment? Sure. But I would argue that it was a giant risk. They were essentially designing their own interpretation of Everquest.
---
They knew how successful Everquest was and what made it successful. They were also intimately familiar with the *What-Not-to-Do's* of Everquest, as at least 2 of the designers that Blizzard hired *specifically for WoW* were leaders of some of the hardest-of-the-hardcore raiders in Everquest. And they were *also* intimately familiar with how popular their Warcraft franchise was at the time -- Warcraft III and TFT were extremely popular and their fastest selling titles to date.
---
Sure, there were risks; there are always risks. But to maybe think that each and every risk wasn't *extremely* calculated, weighed, and measured is just naive. They weren't just flying by the seat of their pants with WoW...
---
I did not hear about character creation, but I did hear about reserving a name.
---
LOL
---
Ahhh, FF14 is so good, I love my potate. I stopped playing in anticipation of classic, however, new expansion in a few days....
---
My buddy and I just started Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition on Steam. Its on sale and thought it would be another fun nostalgia trip to take.

Pretty much, I'd say a lot comes down to initiative. If I jumped a lock with a blast and swp and got a fear off, then I felt like it was GG with silence left after flaying and getting another blast off.  It depends on range and who gets what.  I got jumped once by a lock and didn't see it coming and was dead by the time the fears wore off too

Just to clarify, "we did things" definitely meant sex. She was very agressive on that front.

Well that's because you have to kill one to get rep with the other. They're intertwined.
---
I'm not really about winning bg's. I just like mass PvP, over and over.
---
Sorry you picked the game that's emulating vanilla if that's your position.
---
You can't rep with both so I like how you paired them.

The warrior leveling meta is already filled to the brim with half-truths and baseless assumptions, and this won't change a thing. 95% of the guides out there are just parroting the same old commonly accepted tips and tricks. Once you've seen enough of them it's pretty easy to spot who has and hasn't put any actual effort into testing things.
---
If these things remain true however it will absolutely change the landscape for warrior leveling, but probably not in the way most people expect.
---
It was a risk compared to what they are doing now. Lots of MMOs tried to same thing you just described. They hired people that "knew what they were doing" and made an mmo just like wow. You can do all the calculation in the world, but it won't necessarily predict people having fun. Tons of MMOs failed miserably, even using modern analytics.
---
It's why the mmo genre is kind of stagnant right now. Too much input, for uncertain profit.
---
&gt; Sharing your own vision of an artists work that you spent 5 minutes re-coloring with photoshop just strikes me as wrong.
---
I'm curious as to why you think that is? Is it because of the software used? The amount of time spent (or lack thereof)? Modifying the original tone to something different? Should people not modify any art?
---
Or is it because Reddit gives "karma"? Would it be different to share a modified work on a platform that didn't give useless internet points? Is there a way to disable karma points on Reddit?

I remember that one time in UBRS early 2006 while hunting for T0 it became very late and i had to quit at 3am, while my buddy i always played with stayed in - as a noble Tauren warrior and Main Tank, he would not leave his group. We had done so many runs (30+), that it became like a weary second home at that time. Next evening i read a ingame letter from my buddy telling me, what had happened after i left: They managed to get the general down at like 4am and the one and only "Helm of Valor" (T0)dropped. "Helm of Valor" was the sole purpose of us doing doing the UBRS-Runs. The other warrior threw his dice first and got a 2 (out of 100). My pal got very excited, rubbed his hands, threw his dice and managed to get a 1. 
---
That letter was one of the saddest and funniest experiences i ever had in a videogame. I am still making fun of him (13 years later) for beating every probability calculation with just one dice
---
Ho yeah I understand now  😂
---
Leeway better be gone by launch.
---
Wow, thanks mate I had no idea. To be honest if noone here had access to it I was thinking I'd just bite the bullet and buy the premium. I won't bother now though!
---
That's not my video, but I definitely got the idea from luckystrike. I guess it's lost in the ether now.

And this picture is missing the Wildhammer clan
---
You can heal 5 man dungeons as a Ret pally for leveling purposes.  Easily.  
---
Just like Fury/Arms Warriors can tank, no problem.  
---
DPS focused leveling builds for druids/shaman/priests/paladins work fine for 5 man heals along the way.
---
&gt;The scenario you described is perfectly fair and I don't see any issue with it.
---
&gt;DKP is about rewarding time and effort.
---
Given the anecdote, these statements are contradictory. The person was barely ever there for raids, 1 or 2 times a month and had barely any DKP if any at all. They come in, 1 night and get loot because someone else who had been there putting in the time and effort was negative DKP. I'd also like to add that was literally the only night I ever saw them on in my years with that guild (I stayed with them until ~mid way through TBC when I left to go play with RL friends, but I had quit raiding with them and was part of their "PvP group" for arenas). 
---
&gt;It's exactly how DKP works and the reason so many guilds used it is because it was fair.
---
Hard disagree here, I think that it has the potential to be fair and a great system, but it just like anything else has loop holes and runs the risk of being abused. Even still loot drama can still occur when people start hoarding loot and/or new members join that potentially never have a chance to catch up to long time members which begs the question, why join the guild if you're likely to not get loot for a long time?
---
It's worth mentioning that nobody will have gold for some time so what you put up on AH might not sell.
---
If you're into skinning and similar professions, consider vendoring everything for at least a week.
---
Not sure about PVE server, but definitely not rested.
---
no, not at all, its important to bind everything early on so you can get used to those controls as you level.  Besides its much better for overall performance when trying to heal grps.
---
were they even a rep in 1.12, I tried looking into it and I saw they were removed but I haven't heard whether they will be a rep in classic yet, as well as revantusk that was also a removed rep
---
If you backpedal do you even move fast enough to get out before the second attack ?
---
In a hectic combat situation you should only use ur mouse and strafe buttons, but I like to have the other move keys for casual running in the city or semi afk questing.
---
Biggest elephant, the IBS. Fuck...that...weapon. It was kinda sorta okay back when Korak was in the game, but ever since moving the quest to simply win a single AV, it's now easily available at 51 and completely trivializes a massive quantity of drops and crafted items.
---
If you think a few mobs give you the perspective of how a class plays, I'm already done with you.
---
Most classes won't have important spells until 40, and even then it's underwhelming compared to 60.
---
Ele resto good for everything. Best pvp class xD
---
666 mark of the beast. Confirmed blizzard is the Illuminati.
---
So. I don't want to play pet-classes (minus warlock, minus hunter). I never liked warriors. I will play alliance so minus shaman. I don't pay much attention to PvP so lategame PvE is the thing I aim to. Now then:
---
Druid. Never tried playing druid. What specs are viable in classic? Heal? What about moonkin? Or will I have to play cat only?
---
Mage. My main during the start of BfA. I like them for portals and being RDD. Free food/water in classic is nice perk as well. Anything bad about mages in classic?
---
Also, what do you think about these specs:
---
[Fire](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230045001003-5050020123033151-002)
---
[Frost](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230045001003--0535320300035103)
---
Paladin. Every game I can, I play paladin first, but it seems in classic you're play healbot/buffbot or don't play at all. I like how paladins universal but don't like them being mediocre in damage and tanking.
---
Priest. Afaik you're stick to holy spec and can't play anything else. Is there place for shadow? Is discipline just auxilary tree that compliments another one? It something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0522301302-225050030302155) is good spec?
---
Rogue. I'm afraid there will be a lot of rogues, so it will be hard to get a place in the group/raid.
---
Atm I can't choice between Mage, Rogue, Paladn and Priest. Being heal makes the finding of the group easier but the gameplay is rather boring.

Hey lets make the debuff limit only 16 so most specs can't even play the actual game! Basically, if you want to full vanilla experience, you support batching and leeway. If you want these taken out, you MUST also support the removal of the 16 debuff limit or your internal logic isn't consistent.
---
layering has literally nothing to do with congestion.
---
- OG single server: 3,000 players
---
- Layering" 3,000 players per layer
---
How does that affect launch?
---
Id rethink the timeframe come launch. If the stress tests are any indications of how crowded it will be (even more so on launch). There will be so many people tagging mobs and with the spawn rates took about 5-6 hours just to get to level 8 not to mention xp rates are different on pservers.
---
Does China still have child slaves available to grind gold all day and night?  Yes they do.  
---
Gold sellers will be back.  And i'm going to report every one that contacts me.
---
And here I am bored of classic now.
---
I can see that being a chore to balance.  To bad they didn't polish off the death knight and have that undead only horde class.  Basically the anti-paladin, like the units from WC1/WC2.

Honestly it comes down to if you don't pick a tank class, will they be pissed? Cos if they don't mind what you pick then straight up go mage or hunter. People underestimate hunter in WPvP they really shine. And you can easily farm solo. The double mage combo is insane for quick aoe farm leveling, and offers a lot of crowd control and burst for pvp. 
---
Again just be aware warrior/druid means you can easily do dungeons together so just keep that in mind.
---
I’ve been playing World War Z. There’s tons of progression and the difficulty scales nicely. 
---
I’m not sure if you’re into shooters or zombies, but it’s easy to sink hours into.
---
Fucking hilarious. This is the best thread ever.
---
I leveled 2 alliance to 60 in prep for classic, now I just wanna go horde lol
---
&gt; Have an alt guild raid night.
---
I want to do this so bad not only because I want to experience as much Classic as I can (which is something I missed out on when I originally played) but I think it would be a great exercise to have people play different classes, like a tank play a healer and vice versa, so we can all understand the classes better and give tips/tricks to each other for future raids.
---
Oh i thought layering could be added depending on amount of players. So any zone was never overpopulated.
---
My wife plays Live with me now. She doesn’t like the rush rush rush of current dungeon content. I think she will like classics pacing a lot more.
---
Yep, looking at the floor not to lag or crash was a legit strat!
---
They should do that but then you need to start the rolls with the best/rarest items.
---
I you loved SOTN, you'll love Bloodstained. It's not *quite* as vampiric and gothic, but man it has so much more to offer. I'm addicted.
---
Except it isn't, because I have different hardware now and so do they.
---
Top guilds have other ways to make gold anyway. Selling gear in MC and even BWL is not uncommon
---
Is this some I don’t have beta thing
---
I always imagine how poor a relationship must be if someone gets left for an internet person.
---
There is so few players really testing bug in the beta
---
I can already feel that so many bug won't be fix/found until release... it's a bit sad.
---
Sharding does that.
---
dp gets cleansed by all mages and dwarves, and dispelled by paladin/priest/felhunter. shadowguard can only be dispelled by priest/felhunter.
---
it also deals more damage than dp on waaay lower manacost and gives you so much blackout chances. in the time a full dp ticks you can get 2×3 shadowguard procs. this also mean while ud had 1×10% chance for blackout pltroll had 6 times a 10% chance. at 500 sp 3 shadowguard ticks already deal as much damage as a full duration dp. the problem is the healing component to dp, it prevents scaling with spelldamage.
---
i get that you only have good intentions, but you're off the mark here.
---
Yeah, this whole debacle is so blown way out of proportion. You would always have a suffix for Dire Maul &amp; most 15-22 people looking for a Deadmines group will be doing so in General chat in either Westfall or Redridge. The VC people are literal trolls, don't pay attention to them.
---
Stellaris.  My friends caved and resubbed to scratch the itch with BFA.  I refuse.
---
When choosing race as a Druid you're really choosing your faction since you have one race on each side.
---
Tauren is the stronger race though... War Stomp is amazing in PvP. Extra health is amazing in PvP and PvE.
---
Night Elves get like 0.2% more crit from their higher base agi and 1% dodge which is less effective HP than what Tauren gets. Stealth levels don't really matter for Druids because Druid stealth is a lot weaker than Rogue stealth.
---
He is referring to her BF that she broke up with temporarily I think. In which case she did get back with. I beleive she even mentioned she was engaged during that run. 
---
I think what Juicy is saying is the dude she got back with deserved to know that she only broke up with him to sleep around without it being cheating.
---
...rip my hopes of having my name...
---
I remember it well. It was after 5pm and I was working the front desk at my data entry job at the time. I found out via reddit and there wasn't anyone around (everyone left at 5). No one there played video games, had any idea what Warcraft was, so I had no one to tell. 
---
I remember scouring the post, replying to everyone I found interesting, sharing in the excitement.
---
Almost 2 years was too long, and too much of the conversation has soured. It's become something I put way in the back of my mind (until launch).
---
I'm building a house and we're likely to close on it around September 1st. It's going to be an amazing time.
---
LOL "..fucked right through our healing and DPS.."
---
My ideal group for pre-60 five man groups would be 
---
1. Warrior (any spec, likely arms)
---
2. Rogue (likely combat swords)
---
3. mage (likely frost)
---
4. paladin or shammy (utility)
---
5. priest (heals)
---
Some of the most fun groups, however, are the not quite ideal ones where you have strange class combos.
---
I'm thinking about just using a quest addon till 60, then start the whole addons grind
---
It was like a year and a half minimum if my memory serves me.
---
For at least a period of time the auto-unstuck actually bumped your characters location slightly, but I think people figured out some insane WSG glitches with it so they had to switch to the spirit healer option. I think right now in classic it just kills you
---
I’m just here in hopes of them releasing TBC servers too!
---
It's not retail, vanilla incentives in AV foster the Zerg as well. Almost the whole value of AV comes from actually winning. This means that you both want to finish the game as fast as possible, and that if you think you're going to lose it's not worth sitting through a few hours of AV for basically no reward.
---
If we want a tactical game, blizz needs to actually reward tactics. Spread the honor and rep rewards between all of the bunkers, so even if you're pretty sure that your side will lose overall, it's still worthwhile to see if you can take a few of their bunkers. Second, they could simply require you to take all the bunkers by putting a gate on the General rooms so that you physically cannot win the game without actually taking territory.
---
I'm not sure these would work, I'm not sure what would work, I just wish that Blizz was open to iterating on the BG rather than locking in a shitty version of it that 1.12 is.
---
Yes they were. Didn't have rewards or anything, though
---
I moved to Florida 2 years ago and i'm quite happy.
---
BUT MAN I MISS THE FALL! ENJOY IT.
---
For paladin it is b/c the armor you get from Devo aura at lvl 1 is substantially more than the armor you get from the starting gear.  I sell everything but my weapon (including food/water) and go buy it immediately when I'm doing a paladin run.   Different pservs and different blizz tests seem to spawn with different amounts of food/water, so sometimes you have to go kill 1-2 wolves to get the extra couple of copper.  It's still worth it.
---
Why you gotta do me like that...
---
My guild ran things super fairly in my eyes and i really enjoyed it, but we never full cleared aq40 or naxx. Maybe I'll get to this time around.
---
Thinking of dual-box duo-leveling a warrior/mage. Anyone have experience with this particular combo? And from a technical standpoint, would it be possible to achieve efficient synergy with one keyboard/mouse/monitor?

* The Wildhammer Clan in the Hinterlands is now a peaceful faction to the Alliance, meaning Alliance players cannot intentionally declare war on them.

Male undead rogue.
---
You would be minding your business and BAM! Dead. Just like that.
---
You can't retaliate. You can't react - you just die. It used to make me jump sometimes if I was concentrating on my quest or whatever.
---
And it was always bloody Male undead rogues!
---
True but thats a sacrifice you should make if the tank is at 10% hp and you are not casting a heal yet. It will buy you more time!
---
Madden 19 franchises with goofy ass created players
---
Really? I played on that server from its launch until about a month ago, and never ran into any instance of mines/caves having a shitload of mining nodes in them. The respawn rate should be higher, yes, but it shouldn't be spawning more nodes than usual at the same time.
---
Basically my first WoW experience 15 years ago in Vanilla, only with priest (holy) instead of Hunter. I stuck with it until early Wotlk.
---
so basically cut your arms off so you can run faster. 200IQ
---
I was reading through this going why doesn’t he zoom first person and stare at the floor. Then I got to the end lol.
---
&gt; So when the op asks about toggleable client-side graphics - you are okay with that. 
---
No, because that would impact how he perceives my character, and it would be out of my control. Achieving a good appearance in Classic is all about effort - if he don't want to see my ugly-ass Undead face, he better give me a big mask to cover it.
---
It's not exactly about Lower Quality - the old graphics had a general artistic direction that were different from today's WoW. They were a tad more gritty. It's especially visible in Taurens, for examples.
---
If you, like me, loved Castlevania: symphony of the night on PS1, then do yourself a favor and get Bloodstained.  It's amazing.  
---
I'm playing that, Total War Warhammer II and Heroes of the Storm.  
---
But all this "other game" nonsense will end on August 27th.
---
They could have done so much with this faction and made it a cool place for rogues to hangout out
---
Don't think so much about 1.x, think about community. Think about playing with people, server identity, etc. I know that private servers have this to an extent, but I feel this will be the largest community since the height of WoW (but without server transfers and other nonsense).
---
Play a race/class you haven't played or something, but don't be burnt out!
---
Not playing 8.2?
---
Babe he just needs a naga.
---
What the hell is that website? I love it!
---
Sometimes it’s just your day :D
---
Spriest vs Hunter?
---
I play adc in league and hunter feels like a good fit other than the pet being annoying af.
---
Spriest is okay im not a big fan of dots, rather do big bursts tbh. But I feel like I might enjoy healing.
---
Relax. Rest your straw. 
---
Playing around at lvl 60 with a class will give you a better feel than not doing so
---
There's no need for your strange gatekeeping
---
Monster Hunter World and an instant 60 server.
---
Agreed it was always called DM and most likely it was assumed to be dm north
---
Life lesson for everyone. Sadly it's you I'm saying this too but still. 
---
It's entirely possible when she was living with him and hiding texts...they weren't separated, even if they were if you're ever in a position where you're  living with someone and they break up with you but you're still living together and after disappearing for a weekend suddenly start showing interest again. It's a safe bet they were going extra curricular.
---
The whole "alliance locks are useless" meme has really been blown out of the water. WotF only lasts a few seconds and I'm pretty sure it didn't work against horror effects (death coil). Tremor is annoying, but you know what else is annoying? Hpals cleansing all of your magic dots and fears off everything you're trying to take down. That shit's even more annoying in my opinion.
---
Back in Legion in Dalaran there was a metric ton of people dieing in the Underbelly. Dalaran became literally unplayable as there was hundreds and hundreds of skeletons underneath you in the sewers. They removed skeletons from the game, and brought them back in 7.1 with it seems a reduced duration to solve the issue long term
---
I'm still stuck on what class to play in classic. Ive raid  healed every expansion from Cata to BFA, and I think it's time I tried out dps. I've played every class before to a certain extent, with most of my dps experience coming from Balance in Cata and Survival in MoP.
---
This time around in classic I'm going to be putting in  more effort (previously none) into PvP. So whatever class it is, it needs to be competitive in that regard. Also, although I've been playing wow for 10+ years, I would prefer if it were easier to play (I'm not that good). I'm all up for playing niche specs, as I have a nice group of friends who will take me raiding with basically whatever I choose.  The faction we are going is Horde, so no Pally. 
---
Any suggestions are appreciated!
---
It doesn't have to be, but at least it doesn't look like he's holding in a shit.
---
I have relatives that moved to FL.  They say the same thing.  It's fantastic, but you don't get the Fall.  
---
Still, the winters up here are such shit, i think you come out on top.  
---
The only other downside is that bugs don't die every year for you guys down there so they grow to be the size of mice.  The great insect purge that happens every October is most welcomed in the Northeast.
---
*as any non caster class
---
Haha this is gold !
---
The waiting game it sucks.
---
Greymane. I'm about 70% certain that's it. I also recognize the name Aurum. You recall a guild called Altera Vita?
---
IIRC there were... 2, *maybe* 3 really "good" end-game guilds. Altera Vita was one of them. I was with them on my Hunter for all of 2 weeks before they cut me (I was a trial, and frankly back then I wasn't all that good). Exousia was where the dregs and rejects of Altera Vita and the 1-2 other higher end guilds ended up joining. Desperate to raid in a "progression" environment, we just dealt with the verbal abuse and drama.
---
I remember transmutes selling for 10-20g on fresh servers, also.
---
i dont know if im just imagining this, but i felt like wow players back then were much more laid back. I hope majority of the players now will have the same attitude.
---
Yooo - I don't Play mage but I love the idea! Sounds like an awesome tool if you are going to Play mage and don't have everything planned out yet!
---
Great stuff Keep it up :)
---
&gt;Leatherworking is really only useful for some pre raid gearing and onyxia scale cloak.
---
That's why a lvl 5 enchanting alt is great to accompany a leatherworker.
---
Today I learned that battle Rez isn't utility.
---
Rogue also has lock picking for all locked chests/doors.
---
If Nostalrius is anything to go by, this is the correct answer. The BG weekend will draw the rank farmers and lead to fast blast pushes and quick games. 
---
Outside of AV weekend you will get a mixture. Most games start out with a strong push and if it succeeds it becomes a quick game. But if a few people play defense and wipe the initial zerg it becomes much hard to form everyone back up and push again. 
---
This is a best of both worlds scenario to me. Farmers will get their quick games during the AV weekends, people who want long fights will see them happen (just not every time).
---
Devilsaur maffia will control ungoro on each server aswell
---
I had a 35 paladin with 11 days /played, fun times!
---
Press the keys shift-windows-s to take a screenshot of an area and then just ctrl-v to paste it.
---
It's a sad moment when you are a passionnate WoW player, yet you can't actually suggest the game to anybody. I mean' no way in the world I tell a friend to just pickup BFA and start playing, unless he played WoW before and still follows it. Although I know that friend would then be disappointed and leave. With classic, I will finally be able to suggest WoW again. I think I was still a teenager the last time I said to somebody that he should really start playing WoW.  
---
I see a lot of comments here about classic vs retail and why pick one or the other. It's a shame there's only those two with such a huge gap. 15 years of wow brought a lot of different content and it's a shame not to just say "Oh, you should totally play Wrath of the Lich king for x reasons" or "You want to play modern WoW? You should play Legion instead of BFA, it's so much better because of x reasons". But we can't.
---
Nice work as always. Love reading people's fantasy content.
---
I'm sure i'd get burned out playing Pservers, also i just like playing on retails server more unless the game is shut down (SWG) For now i'm enjoying Original sin 2, solid rpg imho.
---
Tauren Cat Form.
---
Nuff said.
---
Roll NE
---
Not in the sense of how it was back then, but Wall Jumping actually still exists in BFA. Lots of people seem to be unaware of it, but it is VERY difficult to do. You have to angle yourself so perfectly, and press forward and jump at the same time so you leap forward. You basically have to cling to corners, but its insanely tricky and i'm still practicing.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXppoiTSSm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXppoiTSSm8) this guy knows what he is doing. I personally use a keyboard macro that presses W and Spacebar 1ms between them
---
I saw a video from a guy who got to level 5 in under 2 hours just from walking around. It's a strategy when the mobs are overcrowded. I'll search for the video in a second.
---
60 days... makes it sound so soon, now im all excited again
---
Final Fantasy 6-9 and just enough BFA to not get booted from the guild until I've seen the new raid.

Hunter is better for world pvp, and for gold farming/soloing. Perhaps try it if you are up for a new experience. I'd recommend orc for the stun resist. As the other guy said just be mindful of whether blizzard have fixed all the bugs.

Let us *please* not guess around and avoid spreading misinformation. You are wrong.
---
Killing mobs is what you'll be doing 95%
---
of the time
---
Human Paladins benefit more from their racials imo. Sword/Mace specialization will help when leveling, diplomacy is nice for grinding rep. Stoneform isn't all that helpful as a pally since you can Cleanse yourself in most cases. Human Spirit boost is mildly helpful. Dwarf gun specialization won't help you as a pally at all. I'd go human
---
Dire Maul doesn't have everything, so gold farmed there will be spent on things from elsewhere. Players farming other places will be able to charge more due to the influx. There will be inflation, but prices will go up for both purchases and sales so the real change will be fixed-vendor-prices being less significant.
---
If you're getting gold only through loot/vendoring, then yes you will be at a disadvantage...but the Auction House prices will be based on an actual economy of trading between players, and will balance things out.
---
tl;dr: It's bad if you isolate yourself from the economy and only occasionally buy stuff, but if you sell on the AH as well as buy you'll be a healthy part of the system.
---
Right. 
---
The way the manor was hidden made it so immersive, like I was really at a secret hang out spot for a league of assassins or something.
---
Blessing of Kings.
---
I got to level 15 with only 2 4 slots :( my second one dropped at level 13. It's RNG, we don't have a big enough sample size yet
---
I would have been on higher priority for gear anyhow. *shudder*
---
Gouge is extremely strong for any PvP encouter, as it allows you to restealth safely, but even in leveling, even in pure grinding/mob bashing, it's something really good to have.
---
Keep something in mind. You gain 20 energy every 2 seconds. In average, you gain 40 energy during a basic gouge, and 55 for an improved one, and the cost is 45.
---
Sure, one mob may be slower to kill that way. But in the long run, while you are indeed grinding, it's way stronger to avoid 5.5sec of being beaten, and gaining some energy, than using a basic gouge to directly backstab afterward. That would amount to a backstab costing 105 energy, no other gain, and 4 sec of killtime gain (if it's enough to finish the mob right away) instead of a backstab costing 105 energy, 10 energy left, 5.5sec added to killtime but 5.5sec without taking any damage.
---
While grinding, your downtime is not as long as a warrior's one, but it's still there, so instead of regenerating between fights for longer, do it for less time after fights, and add some of it in fights, but with added benefits too.
---
Honestly, I tried leveling both way. During Vanilla, I leveled my rogue with it, and I helped a friend grind (A LOT...) on his rogue, without improved gouge. It felt so bad compared to mine.
---
TL/DR : Instead of shortening kill time of 4s and adding them to downtime, prolong a bit your kill time to shorten your downtime, but with benefits (Pausing/FirstAid, PvP, 10 avg energy.
---
\----------
---
Also, try to always engage right before your energy tick. It will award you from 0 to 20 energy for free for this fight, depending on your timing.
---
This is the leveling builds I would recommend for dagger :
---
lvl 11 : [2/0/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fM)
---
lvl 16 : [2/5/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZG)
---
lvl 19 : [2/8/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZGc)
---
lvl 24 : [2/8/5](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZGcZV)
---
lvl 32 : [2/8/13](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZGcZV0xc)
---
lvl 37 : [7/8/13](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMxZGcZV0xc)
---
lvl 45 : [15/8/13](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGx0oLZGcZV0xc)
---
Either respec or adapt to come closer to a final Combat Dagger build, [15/31/5](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xfoLZMIVbbEz0boV), which is one of the best in PvE, highly effective in farming, and between okay to OP in PvP depending on classes you fight (Adre rush is OP vs something tanky).
---
This has proven way more efficient to level as dagger with those than any other "single-tree focused build"
---
As a vanilla mage, I was most concerned with rogues. Undead always seemed the scariest, but it was more about the class than the race. It was all but certain that a rogue would seek to gank you, whereas other classes might give peace a chance. I never encountered a friendly rogue.
---
Also, their sap could be used as a bit of a grief mechanic.
---
You dont get it do you? It will be like this in EVERY guild
---
but where could I have put the square?
---
There are a few caves with that layout of its the one I'm imagining. One in Teldrassil, a few in Felwood, they always seem to be in night elf zones.
---
Discipline priests are actually BiS for almost all content except some phases of Naxx progression and very very early pre-bis. PI is a huge boost to raid damage and what you lose in +heal and spell efficiency in deep holy is partly made up for by the larger disc mana pool.
---
Paladin is a boring buff/healbot. Literally spam FoL and buff.
---
Rogue will be hella popular and will pale in comparison in damage later on in game compared to an equally tryhard fury. If you're not interested in PvP it will be a harder sell than dps warr.
---
You can never go wrong with mage but there will be a lot of them if competitikn is a concern for you.
---
Druid boomkin is not viable, and if reports of cat/bear form being overtuned on pservers wind up being true at 60, feral dps and tanking might be laughable too. Druid healing/support is always welcome but understand you will lack the raw numbers of pally/priest healing in most instances.
---
If you have no preference about DPS-ing versus healing, I say go dwarf priest. Especially on Alliance with no WF, priests are always in demand as healers and have a slightly more interesting playstyle than Paladin. Their tier gear is also pretty decent so gearing yourself up to competent levels won't be a huge timesink -- on top of the fact that skilled healers in general tend to be less gear dependent than dps (melee in particular).
---
Yeah for sure, though it's fine most of the time since you won't find top tier mages to fight all the time at least.
---
My entire server was VC. But who cares what it’s called? Not a big deal either way. Different servers had different ways of saying it and that’s that. No “correct” way about it.
---
yeah, enjoy the preteens!
---
Lol oh shit. The anti backpedal crowd is gonna be pissssed.
---
idk :( I was wondering that myself
---
Cheers dude! I'm not a pro on excel but I think I cracked the formulas for the values etc... I have a friend who's going to play mage and he wanted something like this to know when it's worth breaking the Bloodvine set bonus or upgrade an item that gives crit to one with pure +SD etc..
---
Oh yea, recall seeing that a few months ago. Will be picking it up for sure.
---
Roll warrior. 
---
Roll mage.
---
Roll priest.
---
Roll hunter.
---
Let the binge of altoholisn begin!
---
&gt;Which class for paladin do you prefer?
---
Probably Paladin.
---
... Okay, I know you meant race. When it comes down to racials, I love having Perception in PvP and mace specialization/diplomacy for PvE. Dwarf's stoneform is also really nice, but not required since pallys have cleanse.
---
As for aesthetics, I'm more of a fan of fem humans for their casting animations and male dwarves for their melee animations.
---
It's viable for druids to tank *and* heal 50+ dungeons. Lack of a res isn't a problem if you are tanking, and there are tons of shamans that will be around to res as well.
---
As for "getting a raid spot", I wouldn't worry about that. Healers are always needed
---
They would not have done it, but they found a backup of a backup on a backup.  
---
Without that miracle find, there was no way to parse all the data to make a faithful recreation of classic wow.  What were they going to do?  Watch every hour of video on warcraft movies to get numbers for things like parry rate, elite armor, early level experience bars, and millions of more changes that the true recreation of classic has different from the PServers?
---
Before cross-realm battlegrounds, horde absolutely destroyed alliance in most WSG and AB games on my server. Horde just naturally gravitated towards hardcore pvp and casual pve, while alliance was more hardcore pve and casual pvp. Did others have a similar experience?  If so, do you think we can expect similar imbalances in battlegrounds in classic?
---
Do you have an album with all of these?
---
O
---
Yea what the other guy said, you'll need a reliable pocket healer to wreck.
---
Barring that I feel like mage r13 gear looks baller and you can certainly wreck in bgs as mage, healer or no
---
Damn...
---
As opposed to peeing on the lid?
---
I forgot where it was, but I fell off a mountain going to my corpse (was by a river). Had to run through at least 2 zones to get back to my corpse, but by then my group had abandoned me lol
---
Definitely a needed post. You mentioned you've posted your own methods on Reddit before? I searched your profile and couldn't find any such posts. Do you have a link to it?
---
I can guarantee that in TBC there were some flightpoints that if you took them were incorporated into a different trip, causing you to divert on your way. If you didn't take them, the other trip was just a straight or more straight line. I don't know if this was the case in Vanilla. I just don't remember which FP's are 'bad.'
---
lol no, troll for pve sure but pvp not a chance
---
&gt;Most of the time you do the hamstring method you're having to double back over ground you've already crossed, and risk pulling mobs you didn't want to deal with.  
---
&gt;I just don't think you save more time than sitting and eating every couple of mobs. (With some +Spirit you shouldn't have to eat much anyway)
---
This is absolutely not true and missing the point of hamstring kiting. Done correctly, you aren't losing any dps and it is purely a speed increase. It might not be a big increase in speed per mob but it definitely adds up over the course of 1-60. 
---
It's also a misconception that you need a lot of space to do it. You don't. But obviously it's not possible to hamstring kite in EVERY situation.
---
That’s a very fair point! I will say tho I am more concerned with managing weaving autoshots, pet micro/management than I am with fall off. The class just seems the most mechanically difficult and maybe I need something just a tad more straightforward.

I’m playing Live. Most of my friends that are coming back for Classic have already re upped their accounts. I have the Beta but I’ve already capped a warrior and got all other classes to Deadmines level pretty much. I’m still playing the Beta when I’m playing solo. 
---
When the boys log on though I’m swapping over and playing with them through the new content. 8.2 has been pretty good so far TBH. I’m going to at least try and finish the story to unlock flying before Classic launches.
---
Draw a parchment-style zone map for vanilla Hyjal!
---
If you would rather burst damage do not play spriest. You also cannot heal without popping out of shadowform which wastes a ton of mana and a global so don't think you'll easily be healing AND melting faces as shadow. Too mana intensive.
---
Go hunter. Pet is not annoying and you can torment 100% of casuals you encounter and at least 50% of people who know what they're up to in PVP.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
WE WILL!
---
I’m stuck between (a) Hunter, (b) Warlock, and (c) Shaman. I like these three since I’ll be leveling casually and I think they are pretty flavorful. I mained a Prest in vanilla and my main concern with Shaman would be getting stuck in Resto in the end game and just ending up a healer again — I enjoyed it back then but I kind of want to try something new. Although I don’t expect to be doing any hardcore raiding, it also would be nice to know that I could find a spot without too much hassle. I also really enjoy BGs and like being competitive in world pvp matchups. Can’t figure it out!
---
&gt; They were the forerunners of the true smash hit MMORPG and even when it launched they didn't know what they had. 
---
I can concur with this based on the information that the Wow Diary and the times Esfand has had sitting down and interviewing John Staats and Mark Kern.  Like when the Wow beta was available to download, they were more surprised to hear the announcement over a PA system they were unaware was in the building than the fact the beta launched.  As well as the immediate Thanksgiving launched required they deploy 100% of their backup servers and begin ordering as many as they could from their suppliers.
---
I've tried DotA and LoL but personally don't like the micro management of last hitting and dealing with all the weapon. To each his own.
---
Nah it's too late.
---
Haha that is hilarious! 
---
Sounds just like my Brother - also dwarf priest and I used to watch him raid sometimes when it was the Weekend :) I was 11 back then so my parents wouldn't buy me a Computer and/or World of Warcraft...
---
I remember the ups and downs - pure Feelings even though I didn't even Play the game a single time :D
---
Nostalgia can be sooo strong =)
---
That was the rumor, anyway.  /u/goldielax25 knows what I'm saying.
---
I meant being able to respec into holy/disc to heal haha. But yeah I definitely prefer bursting someone down as a dps
---
I'm going horde on release so i'm leveling an alliance character on a private server now. Don't think ill get burnt out because I won't have time for an Alliance character, questing is just so relaxing to me
---
Under 100 hours /played will happen at launch.
---
Under 90 hours /played will happen later.
---
The game releases 6pm EDT August 26th.
---
There will be a level 60 before 10pm EDT August 30th.
---
Druids heal in raids. Druids can off-tank in Raids as well, but frankly a Warrior is still a better option even for OT. Druids can tank very well in dungeons though. Boomkin is arguably a wasted raid slot. You will do far less dps than mages, run OOM quickly, but you do provide useful utility. Druids in PvP are a jack of all trades class, that excel in tasks like flag carrying.
---
At work, cant view your mage specs, but essentially you will raid as deep frost in MC/BWL, then Fire in AQ/Naxx. Both manage well in PvP in their own rights.
---
You will heal as a paladin. In raids and likely in PvP. Ret in PvP can be bursty at times, but ultimately you're more effective as holy. Tankiest healer in PvP. Most efficient healer in PvE.
---
Priests are mostly holy. However, a raid may bring one shadowpriest for the shadow damage debuff. Additionally, shadow priests are the kings of 1v1 combat. However this doesn't fully translate into XvX battlegrounds as solidly. You'll still be good, but you're pretty easily swarmed.
---
There will be a fuckton of rogues. You will have issues finding a dungeon group. You will prob be fine getting into a raid though. Most raids will stack rogues and warriors pretty heavily. You're awesome in world pvp and ganking, but can struggle in battleground situations.
---
You're being presumptious and quite frankly foolish. I've been in many AV's that developed into turtles, my explanation should've indicated that btw, but they still wont last for days like retail vanilla ones did. "Duke" it out on the field of strife all you want while 15 people run straight past you to kill balinda or galvanger, cap TP or iceheart bunker. Who am I kidding you probably have no idea about the dynamic of AV. "Duking" it out in the field of strife is incredibly dull compared to huddling in a tower with 10 mates getting besieged by a dozen or so enemy's and an equal amount of npcs. I hate to say it but you seem clueless.
---
Go back retail? coming from a retail baby I assume, who clung to their shitty version of the game we all love instead of playing the real deal, even if it was on private servers.
---
Yeah, I didn't realize how bad it was until I rolled a hunter and had to tank for these people. Backing up into shit, not knowing what fd/trap is, tab target pulling packs, and breaking everyone else's cc with multishot.
---
A solid hunter is amazing in 5 mans, but a shitty hunter is so gd annoying
---
6pm EDT happens when this comment is 7 hours and 28 minutes old.

Blood elves, new planet, flying mounts. All cool.
---
By that you mean /camp works in classic, was broken on private servers.
---
I was playing the new 8.2 patch last night. I was having fun for maybe an hour when I realize I've done all this before in other xpacs. Similar ideas re-skinned with BFA juice. The totem pole was moved again to make you feel like you're progressing your character but no, not really. Things are about as hard as they've always been since BFA launch. They're just illusions to trick you into staying subbed but there's not much if any real substance anymore. I just want classic.
---
Ugh now you have me conflicted because mage is my second choice. I've never really played a caster class and gnome mage is looking good right about now.
---
god... so this is why the past couple of years have felt like an eternity... please classic... END OUR TORMENT !!1
---
Not typically. For a while we would specify east/west/north... then tribute runs became a thing and at that point it pretty much became the default. From then on DM = Tribute and you specified everything else. But for the hordelings out there. DM never meant anything other that Dire Maul. /shrug
---
This is why Blizzard isn't letting more people on the beta even as it is dying.  They don't want casuals to get burned out on what is already a very grindy game.
---
Hunter and feral druid are the only ones that aren't mind-numbing
---
That's just vanilla, the core gameplay is simple and way behind modern retail
---
If you like mage portals, they will be even more of a bonus in classic. It's even a great way to make money by selling portals to people. Keep in mind that they will cost mats though.
---
As for priest, def my favorite class. Depending if you're raiding, you might be asked to go full disc but it's only required for 1 priest per raid. Shadow is great but even better in PVP. If you choose to go priest, I highly recommend to go dwarf just for the fear ward. It's the only race that has this buff when playing a priest.
---
Souldnt there be tanaris and booty bay goblins cities?
---
&gt; All they would have to do is work out a new rewards system for it.
---
not going to happen
---
&gt; Instead of rewarding people based on just a win and kills. Base it on how long was spent in the arena as well as how much they contributed to their faction.
---
you want to artificially prolongue the BG. why? if people enjoyed long AVs you would have long AVs. fact of the matter is, the BG is done as efficient as possible because players chose to. the game doesn't force them too.   
---
you are already rewarded for your participation. you get a higher chance of winning.
---
&gt; This keeps shitty players on good teams from just going afk to gain the honor. And it keeps good players on shitty teams, rewarded for how THEY play not how their team does.
---
this would make it 10 times worse.  
---
"good" players on a losing team would just do objectives the whole time without trying to win the BG.  
---
if you get rewards for anything else then winning, whats the point of winning?
---
&gt; Reward seekers rushing to get through to the end are what ruined it.
---
hate to break it to you. these "reward seekers" is the playerbase. almost the entire playerbase.  
---
I also have yet to see a good explanation on how multiple fast AVs are worse than 1 long AV.
---
&gt; But it really takes no skill to hang out in a BG for 45 minutes to reap the benefits of a winning team  
---
except. if everyone afks or goofs off you won't be the winning team.
---
try Retro-wow
---
I am unable to watch at the moment.  Can someone tell me what's going on with Leeway?
---
I don't
---
&gt; To be fair, imagine if all the corpses ever created were laying around the ground.
---
Fortunately it will never happen because it would degrade both client and server performance over time. And you can imagine group of malicious people generating thousands of skeletons to render zones  unplayable.
---
Wish it came out earlier, so many people are off work/school for the summer =\
---
Wow was 2005, not 1995.
---
Yeah, I think people are tragically forgetting to include HPals in this alliance v horde Warlock discussion. If you're going to include a racial and a *completely separate class* (shaman) in your consideration between the two, it seems only fair to include the alliance counterpart as well.
---
Those cleanses are annoying as fuck.
---
You really should teach this bot to read dates.
---
I mean by takeing u to the entrance of the dungeons same way it did on private servers from what i understand
---
hahah oh man, imagine that's the first thing it happens to you when you just sit down to play after a long day of work. brilliant
---
I leveled 1-40 as Arms/Prot on the Beta. Never had any issues. Course I leveled mostly in dungeons from 20-40.
---
the 4 goblin towns are in the steamwheedle cartel
---
Just play the stress test for the leveling practice.  Getting ahead of the 1-15 pack is the most important part anyways.  Once you get to the 20 zones, a good chunk of tourists may have quit already.
---
Papers, please went on sale on Steam yesterday. Loving it so far.

Warsong Clan should be Warsong *Outriders.*

---
Why make the Bloodsails red? They're perfectly friendly once you get Bloodsail Buccaneer :]
---
Implying I upset you for telling you to Google the most basic question? Dang, I think you'll be alright.
---
Wait, how can a melee attack start but not finish? Aren't all melee attacks instant besides the swing time in between? 
---
To compare it to spells, instant cast spells don't have leeway, the either cast because the target is in range or it won't because they aren't. However, there is a bit of leeway with spells that have a cast time altho not every spell will finish casting just because you started it, basically the leeway had a limit, maybe like 3-5 yards. 
---
So, melee attacks are instant and once they start, they land. So I don't understand what your saying, how can you start an attack but not land it?
---
For PVP shadow priest I'm using these values;
---
Spell Damage: 10 | Shadow Damage: 10 | Stamina: 6| Intellect: 1
---
For PVP disc priest I'm using these values;
---
Spell Damage: 11 | Healing: 8 | Stamina: 6 | Intellect: 3 | Shadow Damage: 3
---
50 player max per query request page.

Leveling with a friend who is brand spanking new to WoW. He plans to roll rogue, not sure of race or faction, and I wanna help him get the funnest bestest experience possible. What do you guys think would be a good race/class combo that would go well with a rogue. Was thinking druid or priest for support or either a dps caster (warlock/mage). Would prefer a good combo that can hold its own in PVP.
---
#NOCHANGES
---
We’ll just agree to disagree
---
But 5 mans are only relevant for a short while, as soon as you've gotten yourself the majority of gear you need from 5mans or gotten gear through raiding you will never ever have to step inside a 5man instance again. Sure Paladins might be the best 5man tank in the game **as long as 5man content is still relevant, which is a very short period**.
---
I think you’re confusing retail with every single game in existence that runs out of content. People want content my dude, gotta keep adding/changing stuff to keep people on it!
---
I realize you were probably making a joke but our loot council was 3 members and no one had anything against anyone in the group. Every piece of loot awarded was always discussed in terms of 'how does this benefit the raid the best?'. That usually boiled down to who does it give the biggest stat upgrade to? I think the rogue just feared bias was rampant if he didn't get chosen. It's probably a rational fear for those outside of the loot council.
---
On a side note, if one of the loot council members was interested in an upgrade then we would sit in the raid channel and send in a substitute to discuss the loot distribution. I would hope that gave the members a pretty good idea of how rational and to be honest boring the discussion was when it came to loot. Most had a pretty good idea anyway as they would see the shittiest gear piece constantly replaced.
---
Replaying games I liked: Doom 2016, Hotline Miami, something along the lines of old silent storm or JA
---
I'm pretty #nochanges, but I completely agree. These "changes" are changes in the same way that having a higher framerate is a change. Leeway was designed to compensate for shitty internet, and that doesn't exist anymore.
---
What do you mean? Rank 3 freezing trap lasts 20sec, 2nd dr is half of that.
---
Holy shit, I understand that. But there isn't going to be 300 people competing for wolves in the starting zone a month in. I really dont know what I can say to get through to you.
---
Actually looking forward to getting Exalted with Darnassus to get that beautiful mount.
---
This is art.
---
You forgot the ones where people tell people they're going to enjoy the game and to play nice and to allow 40 moonkin into their raid because everything easy. Thats definitely at least 15% of posts. 
---
Or the all important 60% of posts up for a couple hours then mod smashed.
---
Stuff like this is why #nochanges seems silly from the start. What’d be the problem in adding some cool rogue quest line with a small reward, or the (planned) rep grind for horde to match winter spring.
---
😥
---
Thanks for the timestamps
---
I plan to main warr and alt mage so I know the feel man. If you plan to pvp a lot though I still say mage. Warrior basically requires you to be tethered to be tethered to another person (healer) to reliably wreck in bgs and wpvp, whereas mage is much more soloable for pvp.
---
Orc Warrior in Rank 13 gear....
---
We straight up hung out there for hours on end, dueling and working on poisons etc instead of levelling or doing anything productive. I loved that place.
---
&gt; having the FP added time to other flights because you'd divert through that area.
---
I don't think this is true at all.
---
So why are they not in /r/DiabloImmortal!?
---
I think it was around wrath, I remember queueing for arenas in Org and people would walljump [a little tricky, not too bad] up the slightly sloped walls to get to the rafters.  Good fun.  Bliz detected the fun and we know what happens, truly pissed me off.
---
I agree. I can see Improved Gouge being very good together with Remorseless cause of not having to bandage post fight.. That'll save 4-5 seconds on the Remorseless timer and thus increasing the damage of my next opener more often. 
---
I've actually started looking into a dodge build with Setup. With a dodge build I'll be wanting my opponent to attack me at all times to get more free cp from Setup. Thus Improved Gouge won't be very good (in that situation). I have no idea how effective it will or won't be but since there's no info online about that talent I don't think I have much to lose. 
---
Thanks for putting the effort into such a great reply!
---
I can't really fault him. I mean, isn't that the RP part of ERP?

Mage or Priest. As someone who’s mained a rogue in vanilla and retail up to WoD. I’d choose mage to be with since I’m a PvPer and together we’re OP. Two glass cannons.
---
Can’t tell you how many times I’ve logged onto the game and would see my character in the character selection menu as a ghost and think “ffffuuuck I forgot about what happened last night... god dammit” and play my alt.
---
I am looking forward to playing an undead priest at launch. My girlfriend is excited to play also but we have having a tough time deciding. She is most interested in mage and warrior but the issue with mage is that we will be fighting over the same cloth armor more often than not it sounds like. With warrior she would want to be DPS and not have the pressure of tanking, but I hear this is tough to do while leveling as everyone will want her to tank. 
---
So what are your thoughts on the above or possibly other classes that would work well? 
---
We are interested in all content PvP and PvE and will be playing on a PvP server. Thanks!
---
undead male rogue of course... the stereotype! ... sadly by the time i've "encountered" him, i'm already dead
---
These posts and especially the titles are getting a bit tiring mate. And judging by the downvotes I am not the only one feeling that way.
---
I've dealt with the hoarding issue by dictating an anti-hoarding rule.  You can do this by implementing a "Max dkp amount".  meaning after a certain point, you can't earn any more.  This incentivises people to spend it.  Which means a new member is only ever a few raids from having as much DKP as everyone else which means he can bid.
---
As for the contradictory statements, they aren't.  You just got a ton of loot.  You were rewarded for raiding.  He came on and raided....so he got the next item because you had no points left.
---
This is fair.  You got loot.  He got loot.  Both of you were rewarded for raiding.  You aren't SERIOUSLY suggesting you should have ALSO gotten the Bloodfang belt on top of what you already gotten?  This would be unfair.
---
You raided more, therefore you got more loot then him.  As it should be.  But it doesn't entitle you to everything.  He raided 1-2 a month.  So he would have enough dkp to occasionally get an item.  This is fair.  He doesn't get nothing....but you get wayyyyy more because you put in the time.
---
As i said, DKP is the best way to reward a time investment.  Your example has proven this.
---
If you need cheese to level a Warrior...you are not worthy of a Warrior. Level it like a real man, get Cooking and First Aid. Or am I the only one who always did this and never had problems during leveling lol.
---
It's come to this. Reddit is now about making suggestions that are already in game? I miss the office memes. :P
---
Where are the zandalari in classic?
---
They come down from Duskwood with so much anger I just don’t understand
---
Beautiful arts!
---
As a horde I wish you alliance had more anti horde banter to throw our way.  You're all too nice to me.
---
woah that mustve been such a great night hahah
---
 **&lt;Azoic&gt; recruiting for classic - EU HORDE 2 day raiding guild**
---
\- With the re-release of classic we're 5 danes wanting to form a community to raid, world pvp, hangout and other good stuff. we intend to raid 1-2 days per week (probably 2). we'd like a chilled atmosphere where you'll have the time to study, work or whatever you need time for and still be raiding at a somewhat high level, **some of us have exp up to top 25 world on live servers so you'll be in good hands**. with the fact that we guys know each other there won't be any ninja looting, drama or jazz like that.
---
\- **for now the set** **raiding times will be 19.00-23.00 thursdays and sundays** **(this can be changed)**  
---
we'd like our raiding atmosphere to be really "down to earth" in the way of people wanting to show up more than "having" to. we want people to be able to go to exams, do their work etc. without being thrown off the raid team, this is also why we're aiming to get around 45-50 people in our core raiding team so raiding won't feel extreamly mandatory.  
---
This being said we ofc would want people to show up as much as possible and loot will be distributed for people that show up more than others, and we'll prio items like thunderfury for prot warriors.
---
**-** **requirements and what we expect from you:**  
---
we except you to try and stay to 1 class and keep that up to date and not play 10 class with white gear going into raid (should be fairly obvious)  
---
other than that it's a big plus if you have any form of raiding experience so you know your way around things.  
---
we'll be discussing professions for everyone and things like that before launch so dont worry too much about that.
---
\- we'd like people to be 18+ of age (can take exceptions if you're 2 friends thats 20 and 17 for instance)  
---
\- decent attitude towards raiding (we dont want people that drag others down, but at the same time we want people that take raiding serious so we can actually progress)
---
**-** **how to apply and reach out for us:**  
---
you can add my discord on Daniel/shrum#8973
---
another option is to join our recruitment discord if im not online and you can talk to an officer instead: [https://discord.gg/sZR9kF](https://discord.gg/sZR9kF)
---
if you came this far, i hope you consider joining our ranks to become the best 2 day raiding guild out there.  
---
have a great day, GM Daniel
---
I'm not arguing that, just that you said paladins will be forced to heal in 5 mans. Which isn't true. 
---
Lots of people get paladin tanks geared and do righteous orb reserve runs through scholo because they're even stronger vs undead. 
---
In raiding yes they're entirely focused on healing.
---
Dude do you ever have anything positive to say? You're one of the most intolerable, miserable, poorly educated dunces I've ever seen online and my first modem was a 300bps USR.
---
Learn to check your real life baggage at the door when you login. My god.
---
Every comment I see you make is some pathetic attempt at displacing the grief and mystery in your life.
---
What graveyard would it even take you there? Also impressive it probably took a player killing you there as opposed to all the guards in Stormwind
---
I feel this way about any rogue and never feel bad ganking them on my hunter. We both know why they rolled rogue on a pvp server
---
You are so right. I am a master at doing that.
---
Honestly it sounds like you might want to be shaman. They have huge, wrecking burst damage in PVP and can heal without respeccing. Ele/Enh is kind of a meme in PVE but is super legit in PVP
---
 My wife said she wants to learn and play wow with me. She rarely plays video games but she said she is willing to try wow classic. What would be the most casual and easy duo classes for us to play together? For race I am leaning towards NE or Human as those starting areas and character models are pretty which will appeal to her. Pretty much just looking for an easy duo setup for us for some grinding and questing. Doubt we will ever raid together.
---
Which professions do you think should i take as a casual playing mage focusing on PvP?
---
Engineer/miner? Default tailoring/enchanting?
---
Herbalist/alchemy?
---
16 casts default if looking away from regen
---
22 casts with talent &amp; mage buff if looking away from regen
---
imp returns to 100% by re-summon which with ability takes 0.5 sec.
---
furthermore the imp has its own regeneration, imp became known as the mana battery back then due to excelling in its regen.
---
I started Vanilla one month after the release and played until the beginning of TBC. So don't play the "you know nothing" card. You're no more a Vanilla economist than I am.
---
We're gonna have to agree to disagree on the impact of layering on the BL economy. 
---
I don't like layering, but for the community aspect. On the economy side, the hardcore that will get all the BL will keep it for their guilds, it's too precious to sell it to the masses.
---
And anyway you take it, the hardcore will always fuck up the game for the rest of us, layering or not. This is my fear if there are very few EU servers : all the hardcore will be concentrated on a couple servers, it will be hell.
---
Of course people want content but once upon a time people would log in an continuously play content they have already played.  Communities formed, player generated events happened, It was more that "sword and spell simulator 6" This went on for years and now people treat it as consume as fast as they can and unsub like it's a single player experience.
---
I leveled as tauren and faction switched in wrath to NE.  NE felt more natural to me after the initial shock, I think he's onto something.
---
Onyxia pug, 1 boss only:X
---
I prefer this, than bitching and moaning about layers/streaming, etc
---
Portal master is by the mage trainer and first aid trainer.
---
I've been on them for 9 with while playing retail until mid WoD. Leveled characters on both factions. I'm sitting on most likely 25 60's from all the years. I usually quest a different route and even try a non alpha race with said class. If I ever felt burn out it would be ranking to 13. The honor pull will be a lot smaller and easier on Classic. So I doubt I'll feel any burn this time around for PvP.
---
Because the design philosophy isn't making it classic+, it's the make the game as it was back then as authentic as possible, whether to preserve it and let new people try it out, or let the nostalgic people come back and play it again. If they changed it too much they wouldn't have a strong legal argument against private servers, because they could claim they are providing a version that doesn't exist, the authentic 1.12 experience .
---
I've been playing a game called reddit.
---
Also available in the stress test client.
---
So many nice fixes in the new client, more please!
---
Have any of the current/old devs talked about Grim Batol at all? There's a big closed metal door behind a mega shitload of lvl 60 elites in some corner of Wetlands. 
---
Was it one of those scrapped ideas (ie Karazhan/Emerald dream) that never made it to fruition? Were those elites even used for anything? Farming? Quests?
---
reddit.com/r/world_chat
---
I played a rogue, only a rogue and two thousand hours of rogue in retail classic. I never played any of the other expansions other than perhaps 20 hours of TBC. (Narkerrit EU Gorgonnash)
---
The leeway mechanic was nothing like this. Not one bit. All I did was duels.
---
Hitting hunters that run away worked from a distance that was exactly like you would and should expect.
---
I have seen 0 leeway private servers as well and that is also bad (you never get to hit).
---
This here is *wrong*. It was not like that back then. So far any piece of evidence had flaws.
---
My latency back then was around 40-45 ms (ISDN in Germany). My latency now is at around 18-19 ms (fibre in Germany).
---
Can't subscribe two weeks before?
---
have my upvote.
---
How about an instance in the old iron forge area?
---
It's crazy big and if you're moving you can attack from a visually absurd distance away.
---
Only lames get left by their gf for some random dude that she’s never met.
---
Got ganked there on the beta and had to make that trek, luckily Desolace is probably the second most afk/autorun friendly zone second to the shimmering flats lol
---
I like that idea. Thx for the recommendation :D
---
I was privy to a lot of their conversations (including one they had WHILE I WAS THERE). They definitely broke up. She basically ignored him hard while he was there during it. They had their own living space together and neither had tons of money so it took him some time to find somewhere else to go. Though that makes it more scummy, because she made him rearrange his life temporarily just so she could have other sexual experiences for a bit. 
---
I mean, we didn't just sexy time talk and then meet up. We spent like 6 months telling each other everything about ourselves and being really close. She didn't hide anything about the relationship from me. She knew for some time before deciding to break up she was daydreaming about doing other dudes and decided she wanted to act on it. While she hurt me pretty bad, in retrospect I could see her angle now. She wanted to see if those feelings meant she wasn't into him, or if they were just curiosity.
---
I thought the exact same thing.
---
As a mage will I be okay going Tailoring/Engineering? I have heard people go engineering without mining fairly frequently but I struggle to see how you can afford to level engineering without mining also..
---
L O L
---
That's a pretty bad analogy to compare. Handing out items vs buying gold isn't even comparable.
---
You could buy 10,000g and still not even see Thunderfury no matter how many carries you pay for.
---
It's obligatory for all of us to downgrade our mics a lot and get back on vent for classic :)
---
Eng 100 times out of 100. The only reason you wouldn't is because it's expensive
---
I played a hunter in vanilla and Ned was the biggest fucking douche. I had to carry 3-4 backup bows in case I lagged and missed a class call and he broke my weapon.
---
Imagine that: 3 tanks on Alliance, 1 tank on Horde.
---
Doh &gt;.&lt; fixed
---
Just sell your food and water, that's 5c each, giving you the 10c you need. Armor is equally useless, but you shouldn't need to drink or eat for a good while m
---
This did come up more than once in the interviews with former devs like John Staats on the classiccast or countdown to classic podcasts. Unfortunately I can’t remember the full answer other than it just didn’t make it for release.
---
I don’t need it but if it’s out there and people are using it you best believe I’m gonna do it too lol
---
It depends on your class. Each class has its own spells and ranks that are ideal to downrank, and it changes over time as your gear gets upgraded as well.
---
You won't have to worry about figuring all that stuff out though. Someone will make a classic Icy-Veins equivalent including what spells are ideal.
---
Also, don't downrank HoTs.
---
I think orc is the shaman race lorewise. I’m pretty sure they created shamanism, or at least brought it to the horde from Draenor. 
---
Taurens work with any of their available classes lorewise. Warriors to defend encampments, hunters to gather food, shamans are their connection to the Earth Mother and Druids are a rite of passage to connect them to the wildlife.
---
You don’t start with 5 food 5 water in classic
---
That's how i'm going to be counting down till classic. Shit's more exciting than new year's
---
In Vanilla, my main focus was PvP, eventually committing to grinding out rank 11, and raiding was only an after thought (only made it as far as Nef before TBC pre-patch). This time around, I've got less time on my hands. I'll be in a raiding guild, so I probably won't do too much organized PvP. Mostly wPvP while farming. Should I go Gnome or Dwarf rogue? I only played Undead in vanilla and alliance were mostly PvE on my server, so most rogues I encountered were hooman. 
---
My main internal arguments are these:
---
In favor of dwarf: 
---
* We already have ways to break roots/snares (vanish, imp sprint), but no way to clear bleeds/dots
---
* Many snares can be spammed, so does escape artist ever just get wasted?
---
* Treasure finding is a nice QoL
---
In favor of gnome:
---
* being kited is more frustrating than being bled/dotted to death
---
* shorter CD on escape artist vs stoneskin
---
* adorable pigtails
---
I really want to druid. But I don't want to be dead weight!
---
Are resto druids really that much worse than other healers? How much so?
---
Are feral tanks really that much worse than warriors?
---
I was playing a private server on a PvP server but when I reached stone talon mountains it was camped by level 60s so I stopped. I'll just wait until Classic releases.
---
Now I'm playing Borderlands 2. Probably until Classic.
---
Yes. We have systems for keeping bugs out of the house (some people spray,we've got an in-the-wall system, etc), and let me tell you. I pay that shit BEFORE my mortgage.
---
Growing up in new england did not prepare me for spiders the size of my hand *shudders*.
---
Summer has always been my favorite season, and having a 8 month summer and 4 months of spring/fallish weather is awesome, but its weird to not have that fall smell and the leaves and the atmosphere.
---
I visited CT last october and just walked everywhere. I was snorting the fall air like a drug, haha.
---
Nope. I know good locks that smash anything 1v1 on fresh.
---
Priest is a really fun starter class. Simple, durable, intuitive, and just a strong all around class. It is one of the highlights of classic wow class design imo. Plus it gives her the flexibility to dps or heal.
---
I was hard set on rogue for the past month. The fast play style and big crits looked so fun! But I wanted to be a bit more unique. So I began looking into Warlock or Priest. But the idea of always casting except wands was the biggest problem. 
---
Luckily this week I saw a nice in depth video of druids. It seems to tick all my boxes. Melee for PvP, heals for pve, and some ranged spells to satisfy my needs when getting kited or rooted. What are some major drawbacks to Druid? And what are some good QoL aspects of druid? 
---
I'm now deciding on druid or rogue!
---
Really bugs me how the horde and alliance titles don’t fit within their colors.
---
Yep, you caught me.
---
I don't. These don't lead to any discussions whatsoever. If OP would at least make them a text post or a comment things would be different, of course.
---
But yeah, I can downvote, hide and move on. It's just that this time I am blocking the user because they promised it would be "the last" two weeks ago and the scores steadily went down from almost 1000 to negative scores.
---
I would be ok with Auto-Loot as a toggle option simple because shift-click looting is a thing ... but ... where shift-click didn't work was in pick pocketing.  There was always that little bit of extra danger in the additional time for you to click the loot and the server response to your looting.  If they could disable auto-loot for pick pocketing, I wouldn't see a problem with it.
---
What a satisfying story!
---
The name of your guild sounds very familiar. I played Alliance on Warsong so I don't remember too many horde guilds from back then.
---
How is AoE grinding as a Mage going to work on launch? From what I read, the consensus seemed to be there is no way you're going to get to the second zone before everyone else that it won't be worth it atleast in the world to AoE as a Mage, you'll just be left with one mob at a time. Private servers have much faster respawns than Classic does.
---
I thought it was added in like 1.12.1 or some other tiny and/or bug fix patch?
---
Its possible for pink skins if they complete all NE quests in darkshore, ashenvale, and feralas.
---
But I want classic+
---
Hey there Zeracho, I understand with responsibilities it can be hard to find a right fit for you but I'd like to see if we could be a good fit for you. We're going to be creating a Fresh Core for Launch and have raiding experience 9/9 AQ. You can contact me on Discord: Resi#4722 ; or see my previous post via Reddit and see the Discord / Application.
---
Honestly I think that would have been really cool. Faction differences aren't a bad thing imo
---
Spell batching windows were larger back then so it's possible that even though you used a melee ability while a target was in range, that it would move out of range before the ability landed. Auto attacks on the other hand do have what you could call a 'cast time'. The damage doesn't occur as soon as the weapon moves but only once you've swung. This is more noticeable with two-handers.
---
I felt the same way during vanilla! But I’ve been hearing that since alliance is better for min/maxing , they’ll have more hardcore pve-ers and just a bigger pop in general which would probably lead to also more/better pvp-ers.
---
on classic how far into the content do you think people will pug?
---
ony zg, and MC or maybe bwl?
---
Yojamba Isle. They're linked to rep turn-ins that you acquire while running ZG.
---
I'm with you. Keep the spirit of the game but tweak some key things.
---
“Strong legal argument against private servers.”
---
You mean the fact that it violates the toa and it belongs to them doesn’t make it illegal enough?  
---
That argument is laughable
---
Nice work!
---
If you are tired of their original content, then surely you read the other threads and know you are incorrect.
---
Do you also have a list of rewards for rep grinding?
---
Hunter is always a decent first class.
---
I've been playing a F2P MMO on steam called Eldevin. It feels a lot like a blend of Runescape and Warcraft in terms of gameplay, lots of grinding and skilling up, but decent WoW-ish combat and talents (though not as responsive or...good). I'm not really sure if I'd wholly recommend it, but I can say it sports a surprising amount of quality in some areas, while having some glaring flaws in others. I streamed it to a few people and one of the devs came in, told me a lot about the game. Apparently it was developed by only 8 or so people like 5 years ago, so it's pretty impressive when that's considered. It's a bit dead but you still see other players running around fairly frequently. It looks like an oldschool EQ-era RPG which I quite like.
---
So basically I play that on one monitor and watch classic WoW content on the other. Basically the same concept as watching porn and wackin it.
---
You should let her pick which ever class appeals to her the most, and pick around that. I don't think the combination matters all too much, but maybe pick a class that has some heals if she doesn't. Also recommend picking a class with a different armor type than hers. Have fun!
---
It will probably always be this way. Horde racials are built around PvP and Alliance PvE. Although, you will always find people on Alliance great at PvP and Horde at PvE. But due to setup people mainly focusing one or the other are going to gravitate towards the one better suited for it.
---
Seems to be a bit "overtuned", see for instance: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c401vo/you_can_run_through_improved_blizzard_thanks_to/
---
I wont play classic if there are no german servers for me to play on. Its judt flat out rediculous of blizzard.
---
I would bet every gold I'll ever make in Classic it wasn't 10%-20% of players in Vanilla and won't be anything remotely close to 80%-90% in Classic that solo farm DM.  Heck, I'd be surprised if it's even 10%-20% in Classic.  Maaaaaaybe most raiders and "serious" players will try solo farming DM, but you are forgetting just how many casual players players there were and will likely be.
---
Not to mention, alts are relatively more difficult to level up (time-wise) so many players won't even be playing classes/specs capable of soloing DM.  I can only speak for my friends, but everyone I know who is coming back for Classic has no intention of going anywhere near as all-out as they did in Vanilla.
---
Okay? but that would happen without leeway if they got into your melee range and out of your bow/gun range anyways, I don't see your point?
---
We were an Alliance Guild. I originally made a BWL Music Video for our guild that I've been told other guilds used to help with strats, but I dont know how accurate that is though
---
ive leveled 2 characters to 40 and 1 to 30 on the beta lmao im pretty filled with regret but i think i'll cool it off for the last 2 months
---
My Friend said logging out while flying will drop you off at the next flight master instead of flying the entire path you choose.  Does that count as a trick?
---
If you're a priest, you pair well with anything really. If you were going to play together and level together, I'd say warrior. But in reality you likely won't be at the same level for too long, and soon she'll be on her own leveling as a warrior... which is horrible, especially if you don't have a game plan.
---
Ultimately she should play whatever she wants to. She can definitely avoid tanking if she wants to play a warrior. Just ignore anyone who thinks otherwise. But every class pairs well with priest, there's no real synergy to exploit.
---
&gt;You can do this by implementing a "Max dkp amount". 
---
Ok, but then you're not really rewarding people for the time they put in, what's to stop someone from (when they hit the maximum amount of DKP) to stop raiding until say, it's BWL night and you're getting ready to do the boss that has something they want and they literally log on/get in for just that fight? 
---
&gt;This incentivises people to spend it.
---
Only in theory, but people will still hoard, and now you've created a scenario where let's say that 2 people have hit max dkp and want the same item, what do you do then?
---
&gt;This would be unfair.
---
By your metric it isn't. Again, your quote. 
---
&gt; DKP is about rewarding time and effort.
---
Where was the time and effort given by this other player? They joined for literally 1 night, I had been raiding with this guild for 2 or more weeks at this point (maybe more, this was 14-15 years ago) wiping in AQ40, providing (free) potions/elixirs/cooking recipes and what have you to our various members and this person comes in and gets loot that I could've used much better (seeing how I was raiding consistently and putting forth a much higher effort than them? 
---
Again, if you think DKP is about reward time and yet think this is fair then I'm not sure we're on the same wavelength of morality.  
---
&gt;As i said, DKP is the best way to reward a time investment. Your example has proven this.
---
Me: raids for weeks
---
Them: raids one night, gets loot that was an upgrade for me, never logs on again.
---
You: yep, seems fair to me
---
Your job isn't spamming shadowbolt in BG's. Also, crit is a poorly itemized stat for warlocks in pvp, as it doesn't affect our dots.
---
There's a mountain that you can just walk up (no glitches, no wall jumping, no precise jumps or any of that) in Dun Morogh that leads straight into Wetlands. You can jump off and spirit res right next to Menethil Harbor and grab that FP pretty quickly.
---
Interesting, i know you can level from exploring didnt think itd be that quick or practical.Might be the play to pick up some flightpaths too!
---
Peak class mechanics, specs whose identities actually feel fleshed out. Affliction warlock actually dots in raids, Demo warlock actually wants to use his pet in raid, destro warlock has a wider variety of spells, not just spam shadow bolt.  Well that is till T6ish at which point S&amp;F takes over and warlock life becomes boring af...but you can play this game for every class, mechanically they all played soooo much better.
---
Peak 5man mechanics, particularly with heroics. Tons of dungeons, trash fights had actual mechanics that mattered, every single boss had interesting mechanics. Yes vanilla wins on overall atmosphere compared to the loot corridors of TBC, but the gameplay itself was infinitely better.
---
Awesome raid mechanics. 25 man raids were far more manageable hybrids actually mattered, much more interesting boss mechanics. Kara and ZA were awesome 10 man content, they took what was good about UBRS and just made it so much better.
---
Vanilla was a better world and probably a better overall MMO, but mechanically TBC is a better game.
---
I don't know why the FUCK people are downvoting you. Fuck karma whores man
---
I had forgotten about that!
---
One pvp thing to note is that NE druids don't have to deal with Gnomes and Escape Artist. It's a small thing but, like an Orc resisting a stun, a gnome war/rogue getting out of your roots can really ruin your day. Also, being able to shadowmeld and eat is the bees knees.
---
Probably not advisable on your first character because you will lose a lot of gold leveling engineering up. Maybe go gathering second to tailor and after epic mount, get engineering.
---
For people that can’t handle.(handle it!). Barrens chat
---
It was amazing. My friends group chat had never blown up like that
---
[Silver](https://www.gog.com/game/silver) is a great game!
---
Go Shaman. You can wreck in your own right in PVP (compared to non-shadow-priest) and shamans will always always be in demand as PVE raid healers on account of their windfury totems and strong raid healing abilities. Most ideal 40-man comps will have more space for shamans than any other healing class. Basically, you'll always be in demand in PVE and can perform better in PVP as a PVE raid spec than priest. Druid might be a better PVP-only option (though flag-running in WSG requires a very specific, non-PVE spec) but you will have fewer slots in raid (1-3 as opposed to 5-8) and will generally be lower in healing throughput than priest or shaman.
---
I've never heard of a melee cast time, are there any sources on this?  
---
Like do different weapons( or weapon types) have different cast times? In my experience, I've never noticed. You're either waiting between swings(mods like swing timer help) or you swing and hit because you're in range or you don't do either because you're out of range. I've never once seen a swing animation(or swing timer reset) after starting an animation and never land it.
---
Not to mention that you can easily farm mats for Blind
---
I would say druid for double stealth, but it's not the easiest class for a straight beginning. Priest is my default rec for a straight noob to the game. I just posted this in another comment:
---
&gt;Priest is a really fun starter class. Simple, durable, intuitive, and just a strong all around class. It is one of the highlights of classic wow class design imo. Plus it gives her the flexibility to dps or heal.
---
Are you going Horde? If so then Shaman. There may be some overlap with the warrior gear (especially two handers) but if you're running a lot of dungeons together (and you should with that comp) you'll have enough gear to choose from for the lot of you.

Shaman will provide not just their own dps, but also major dps gains to the warrior if they go enhancement spec for leveling along with all of their other great utility. For dungeons and raids they'll typically use the same totem set-ups, but in world content their variability is a huge boon. Not to mention they can support your priest with back-up healing. 
---
I don't see you guys dying that often with this comp.
---
I don’t think very many people at all treat WoW like it’s a single player experience. Gaming as a whole has changed. Back in 2005 there weren’t many alternatives and actually good competition for people to leave and go to. Now, the moment content runs out and you’ve completed your gearing, done your fair share of pvp, and ran the raids countless times, you move on to something more fun that’s available. WoW, even in its retail form, is still a largely community based game. The whole sticking with a game with no more content will never happen again, evolution is the way to go. If blizzard wanted people to hop back on the beta, they would increase level cap to add more content. Can’t expect people to give up their free time on contentless unfun shenanigans when there’s better options.
---
.... I hate you I'm now considering this option.....
---
What setup do you have in mind? I've never done dual-boxing but I can look into writing some basic scripts to do the task.

The way I tend to look at the factions is order vs chaos, and I dont mean that figuratively. Stormwind is divided into a 3x2 grid with a canals dividing each of the sections. All sections have a distinct purpose and everything is in its place. It's designed to look like a town with heavily fortified walls with castle to house its nobles.  Iron forge is similar in structure except it has a more circular layout. Once again everything is ordered and in its place. It's designed to look like an intimidating mountain fortress. Walking through the giant opening for the first time, past all the stone dwarven statues is truly a cool experience. The night elf capital is probably the most "horde" like area. It greets you with a formidable wall but once you get inside it almost looks like the city exists naturally instead of being man (elf?) made. It's super forresty with a bunch of calm blues greens and purples.
---
Ill try to keep my bias to a minimum, but when it comes to the horde capitals I really dislike orgimmar. Its orange dirt and stick huts. I honestly have only been to thunderbluff a few times, but from what I remember, I found it pretty hard to get around. My favorite would have to be under city. That being said, that kinda makes sense when you realize that the undercity used to be the human capital of lorderon. Its layout is probably most similar to ironforge with its circular design. 
---
The alliance kinda just click better with me. Both sides have their own brand of faction honor. The Alliance tend to have the more stereotypical good guy stuff with justice and valor and would fall short due to certain temptations that led to corruption. The horde on the other hand viewed their honor as a right gained in battle. Its noble in it's own regard but it's very brutish. When they fall it's usually due to warmongering and crimes such as that. 
---
I didnt play during classic so take this with a grain of salt but the horde also had to deal with the barrens. It was a relatively wide leveling bracket with long distances in between quests. Most people dont like it as pretty much everything looks the same till you get out of there.
---
But it really doesn't. A multi-boxer is not stronger. They can't break the limitations of the game in any way.
---
The one by the lumber camp in the human starting zone.
---
any advantage to getting this rep in classic? the only reason I can think was for insane title but that was from WOTLK.
---
Shitty thing is that there's a LOT to look forward to in the next 2-6 months, it's gonna be a hell of a year for releases, and it would be around the time classic launches..
---
If you're dead-set on playing priest, just run a few extra dungeons every now and then for gear and you'll probably be fine as double clothie! Bonus that you'll probably find fast groups as a priest especially if you're willing to heal.
---
Man this stuff makes me miss vanilla... or more aptly, this country and just the culture in this country back then. It's become unbearably toxic over the last 10 years, I hardly even recognize this place anymore.
---
I love shaman leveling. But lock/hunter leveling are the two single easiest/best classes so they're all good choices. 
---
&gt;it also would be nice to know that I could find a spot without too much hassle
---
Resto shaman is going to the pick here, followed by lock, then hunter.

I found this sub the other day. If you're genuinely interested in content post nax I'd start contributing there.

I first started getting hyped right before the release date. I'm glad I haven't been in this state for the last 600 days lol.
---
&gt;What are some major drawbacks to Druid? 
---
You are the jack of all trades but the master of none ... but the game doesn't revolve around getting top DPS/HPS, so this really doesn't matter. Aside from this, I guess the biggest drawback is that you're kinda expected to be the flag carrier in WSG. If you like FCing, then I guess this is a good thing (personally, I hate it, so that's why its a drawback to me.)
---
Exactly.
---
Have someone in a city que you for a battleground.  You get rezzed and end up in the city
---
I tried to run from Southshore to Wetlands one time across the water and I died like halfway there from fatigue. So I get the idea to just run past my corpse in ghost mode and hit the spirit healer in Wetlands. Like 2 minutes across the pond past my bod, the fatigue bar pops up again -- IN GHOST FORM. So I chalk it up to a glitch and just keep on running and assume once the bar depletes entirely, I'll be still running along in ghost mode. 
---
Nah. The fatigue meter depleted and my dead ghost died. I got double ghosted.
---
I got really good at one point and ended up with 30 kills 7 deaths or something like that, that shit was good. Executioner sword is dope
---
Won't need to in classic since they are adding the drop-off button that will do the same without the logout.
---
Battle net? I thought that shit shut down years ago?
---
IIRC Blizzard removed wall jumping in 2.3 or 2.4. Then in 3.0.8 a bug was introduced with levitate which allowed players to run straight up walls.
---
There was also a way to get into old IF during WotLK by climbing the facade of one of the houses and mounting up on the tundra mammoth which made you clip through the ceiling.
---
MTGA, their release cycle is pretty short, so latching on to new set hype takes the edge off of the classic hype for me.

Ya I dabbled with priest on a private server and really enjoyed it. Really like the shadow animations, flexibility and stuff. Thanks for the suggestion :D
---
The best was hearing the hunter class call, then the delayed 3 seconds and someone swearing VERY loudly lol
---
I was thinking skinning/LW or skinning/enchanting. 
---
I just started to take druids seriously as a possible main for me, so I need to read more. But I think both will provide us with some benefits. Of course enchanting is more of a money sink. And yea mining/engi feels wrong :(

Do y'all think folks fighting over Devilsaur spawns will make Un'goro a good place to farm honor during Phase 2?

What, you can't hit someone with a baseball bat when they're 36 feet away?  Step up your game.
---
Boyfriend and I do warlock/priest, pretty fun and easy.
---
Perfect timing for the steam sale I have to say, might pick up zombie army trilogy and blast through that
---
The biggest shock to me was how effective spirit gear is.  It's better than eating plus I can run to the next mob while healing.  Getting a gear swap add-on and you can swap between fights and even eat with spirit gear if you want to Regen really fast
---
Path of Exile, Teamfight Tactics, Divinity Original Sin 2, Banner Saga series
---
Hi playing borderlands 2. probably until classic., I'm dad.
---
Well you have to pay an active subscription to reserve names. So if you're like a good number of people in the sub, you don't want to waste 2 weeks of sub time (and money) just to reserve 3 names.
---
I hope they go the old school runescape route and expend on existing content with new classic expansions.
---
Warstomp is great - if I'm in Bear form and fighting solo &amp; close to death, as a NElf I'm just screwed. If I'm Tauiren I can pop out of form, Warstomp stums the mob long enough that I can get off a nice HT or Regrowth before dropping back into Bear form to finish the fight.
---
Warstomp is generally very good in PvP, or if I get healing agro in a dungeon.
---
Hi, i'm stuck between Rogue, Warlock and Hunter. I want to do both pve and pvp without struggling to find a grp.
---
I've played Warlock twice on pservers and i loved it, but i'm afraid to be quickly burned out if i play it on classic.
---
I've mained hunter on retail since TBC and also played it on pservers but i'm afraid to struggle finding a raid spot since so few of them are wanted.
---
I've never played rogue but i loved playing feral druid since TBC, but here again i know rogues are overpopulated and i'm afraid to struggle finding a raid spot.
---
had to repost that, sorry! Indeed.
---
I'm pretty certain that you will still "check in" with FPs on the way to the destination even if you haven't learned them.  Never heard of flight paths ever being different depending on what other FPs you know between them.
---
It's easy enough to test though.
---
you forgot the wildhammer clan.  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?faction=471](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?faction=471)
---
Correct, wotf does not break dc.
---
I wouldn’t be so sure on experience per kill. I’ve seen it said both ways. Level xp I don’t think is off. Wouldn’t be shocked if experience per kill is off.
---
Also pservers have 2-3x the mobs even without dynamic respawns. They have more mobs spawned naturally than vanilla did and classic will.
---
You don’t pick a class. Class picks you.

---
There was also many bugs with the Mecano-Hog at first!
---
Idk if you know the lore behind it, but my guess is what you suggested as it being an idea never seen to fruition. 
---
It was the Wildhammer equivalent of Ironforge, but the Dark Irons (pre-ragnaros) invaded and corrupted the city with "darkness". The wildhammers abandoned it and went north to the Hinterlands where they would eventually build Aeire Peak, where they are today
---
All of those are great choices!  I enjoyed my time with all of those in vanilla. I spent time in endgame content as a mage and paladin and did some battlegrounds as a hunter.  This time I plan to go with a shaman.
---
Paladin endgame is probably best as a healer for pvp and pve, but you can make the other specs work in more forgiving content or with insane gear and dedication.  If you want to tank you will find plenty of work in 5 and 10 man dungeons.  Paladin pvp is fun if you enjoy being a support and being hard to kill. And you can bubble-hearth for the memes. Leveling/farming is considerably slower as a paladin than hunter or mage- that's the biggest detractor for me now since i won't have as much time to play.  Hammer of justice feels great, and you can make some clutch plays with tools like blessing of protection and cleanse.    
---
Hunter's a great solo class and can be great in pvp.  They are easy to play reasonably well but still have a high skill cap. They are one of the harder classes to break into endgame content with, but if you network well and are skilled that's not much of an issue. Feign death is nifty for avoiding repair bills in pve and psyching people out in pvp. Ice trap is clutch cc, as well as concussion shot.  
---
Mages can level as fast as hunters, but you will be flirting with death much more frequently.  I see that people point out that Molten Core and BWL primarily involve chucking frostbolts-  personally I loved it. It was low pressure and I got to see big numbers on my screen.  Outside of those raids- which will be the vast majority of your experience- mages are much more dynamic to play. Kiting melee mobs/players is pretty fun. Polymorph and blink feel great. And you can blow things up.  10/10, would play again.
---
Bloodborne for the hundreth time and CS:GO.
---
&gt;I've never once seen a swing animation(or swing timer reset) after starting an animation and never land it.
---
Yes that's the point, it will land even if they run out of range mid swing because of the melee leeway. This has always been in the game.
---
Moral of the story?  Rogues do it from behind.
---
8.2 should tide me over here and there. Not a fan of BFA class design but there’s a lot of content with 8.2. I also play osrs on mobile so that kills some time
---
&gt;the final fantasy releases on Switch
---
One of these days, perhaps in the long-distant future, I would like to kill Omega Weapon in FF8. The thought of starting from the beginning all the way to getting to the Seifer fight just to draw enough Aura for the fight in the end-game does not sound appealing in the slightest for the most part though. IIRC you can "disenchant" certain triple triad cards for aura but that doesn't sound appealing either.
---
Np gl!
---
I can’t get windows 64 bit to install... so I’ve got 60 days to figure that out on top of what class and race to pick

You would actually use talent points on this? 
---
Odd...
---
Boyfriend and I play warlock/priest and it's not that hard competing for cloth drops. I get spirit gear and he gets int/spell damage gear.
---
ah, a glorious way to hit max level! im sure right after that you destroyed all of stormwind !
---
Shaman.
---
I would love to see that, but I fear they'll just decide releasing other time locked servers (tbc/wotlk) would make them more money for less work.
---
Making new content is a hell of a lot more work than importing old content, especially since outland didn't get destroyed by the cataclysm.

I think the first few bosses in BWL are more puggable  than most of MC.

Most pug groups can't even do the corehound trash in MC on the private servers.. but most of those are current generation retail players trying to check out vanilla.

I played sham in vanilla and I hated totems
---
Should be top comment
---
Stoneform can break out of Blind, so its better when you're 1v1ing a rogue (also rend/rake/rip too I guess, if that ever happens)... but on the flip side, escape artist just completely ruins frost nova. It gives you an edge against druid root, but roots has no CD so you'd have to keep that in mind.
---
I agree with you - UD Shadow Priest.
---
Oh that'll be really nice
---
lol I can taste the rogue's salt from here
---
The +Dodge is nice if you are a Bear. Shadowmeld is situational.
---
in stranglethorn somewhere, you got rep for killing gurubashi trolls

They were referring to situations like that after the release. That being said, I wouldn't call for a ban aswell, but I still find kinda lame using those tactics.

I kinda wish they go this route now that i see what you're doing. Looks so cool.

It hurt my brain hearing it. I literally thought they were doing D&amp;D or something until it started getting sexual.
---
Rogue and hunter are pretty easy classes to pick up for beginners, my friend never played WoW before but I got him to play a private server with me and he enjoyed rogue.
---
what do you mean, all my posts have been 80%-90% upvotes since the beginning?
---
though except for the big final world map, I actually have run out of things to post this time
---
Engineering is mainly a PVP skill. Has some use in PVE, mostly for tanks iirc. Blacksmithing is quite good, lionheart helm and titanic leggings are bis for fury warriors.

Is it true that wands are called baguettes in the French client? So you would have like Baguette of Death and Baguette of Fates, Necrotic Baguette etc?

---
&gt;I'm 100% with you on Kodo mounts. Their run animation looks so damn goofy.
---
The Kodo animation is very amateurish. It's basically a body with arms &amp; legs that move only at the shoulder/hip location. Reminds me of a toy dinosaur, or something that a 6 year-old would play with.
---
what kind of an old god induced nightmare is this ?!
---
If these tactics were just being swept under the rug and simply frowned upon by the community they wouldn’t be considered a priority to tackle. Abusing the bug sends a red flag to Blizzard to get it taken care of ASAP, because it really is unhealthy for the game.
---
I don't think it should be a flat price, just a lower sub around $5-10 would be appropriate. But I get why they're just bundling it with the retail sub. It might get some people back in the regular game or retain some retail players that were looking to quit.
---
Love the show. Listen to it on my way to work!
---
why would a text post be better?
---
Baguette de la mort, Baguette du destin, Baguette nécrotique, indeed :') it's the same word for the french bread and for a wand !
---
Fishing is an amazing way to get gold. Stonescale eels in particular.
---
I'm with you on healing. In addition to what you mentioned, there's just too much pressure on a healer compared to dps. The only way I'd play a healer is if it were for pvp. Its just way more fun healing in world pvp and battlegrounds than in dungeons and raids (for me, at least).
---
With the list you gave, I'd probably go shadow priest. They're strong, you get a really fun quest for Anathema/Benediction, you always have the option to go heals if you want. I don't remember many people going pure disc back in the day, but i'll let others correct me. If you decide to go PvP, shadow's fantastic too! 
---
I've always mained a rogue and have never had problems getting into a raid. The only problem I had was having to compete with many other classes for items. Its super fun, and once you get gear, you have many options for DPS (you don't always have to go min/max, this is a 15yr old game after all).
---
Why would you evasion against a warrior that will overpower you through it a bunch?
---
Fuck I can hear it haha
---
I was looking for this one person... Have my upvote!
---
i'm sure at one point in time there was a trick that sent you back to your hearthstone point, and i swear the spirit healer thing was real too
---
anyone else?
---
This is true. I'd be more scared of Hunters if the vast majority of them weren't horribad.
---
it happened like 3 days ago
---
Glad to see I tanked well enough to earn a spot =D
---
Probably over half of the race/class combos have no lore or explanation before WoW.  Since most had no pre-existing lore, Blizzard did a good job choosing race/class combinations that simply made sense or could have relatively believable lore explanations.
---
Nope its still going and it's very active.
---
Is it even possible to calculate values when ignite is used? Since it is affected by other mages and doesn't give you anything at all if you don't get the ignite.
---
I don’t. Then everybody wanting to replay Vanilla gets the chance and everybody else gets nothing.
---
They should restart the first trilogy and build a completely new WoW 2 with all their lessons learned. Can‘t safe retail anyway
---
Nah man, trust him. Just take any license that Disney isnt using and host it yourself for the authentic experience, Disney wont mind!
---
PvP  
---
There no big debate. Feral druid is an inferior warrior and inferior rogue in one package. The fact you can switch between the two gives you no real advantage that will lead to kills reliably. But you do have the best ability in the game to do warsong with.
---
General  
---
Moonglade portal can take some pains away from Alliance Druids as they will have quick access to Kalimdor.  
---
It's hard to gank you. You can just shift out of a lot of CC.
---
PvE  
---
Nonexistent competition for armor pieces. At most some Resto shamans will want the same items that you do. Virtually no other druids around.
---
I guess you've already considered and ruled out humans, but if your main focus is going to be PvE, then humans seem to be the way to go.

I was playing current retail WoW for a while there, but I am done. There is no soul anymore. They have made grinding in that version of the game mind numbingly tedious. I don't know why I enjoyed classic more because there is also a grind in that game too. Oh well, 60 more days!
---
If there was a loading bar, you'd have 10% left.
---
What? Lol. I'm jealous because I don't want to deal with level 30 virgins puffing their chest the moment a vagina comes into a raid?
---
I think it'd be cool if they had a fresh server in classic that reset every 6 months to a year.  It wouldn't be for me but I've seen a lot of people like fresh servers and want them to be happy as well.
---
Monkeynews had a clip of him streaming where he could /sit and it worked. No idea if they fixed it or not.

Leveling tauren druid in vanilla I was always jealous of the night elf cat form.

I didnt even realize it was different for the longest time
---
And what exactly do you want to talk about ? There's no patch notes, no news, nothing. Let the guy have some fun and imagination to what could happen in a few years if that's what the community decides. If you want another post of " hey what are you doing while waiting for classic ? " , " Leeway is garbage " , " Please don't keep layering " well go ahead and keep upvoting those posts.

i've played thousands of hours of vanilla WoW, and i have NEVER grinded rep, EXCEPT for getting like honoured with cenarion hold during like 1.11 or whenever it was

That moment when you discover you can forge new spells by combining two. Amazing game.

Fear, 3 to 4 dots, pet for dispels, healthstones, sac pet. Ez mode 1v1 class. Destro you can blow people up in 1 burst, SL you just dot and dance for free wins. Or go sm ruin and have a balance or burst and sustain. Honestly good warlocks beat anything 1v1 along as there equal gear. Phase 1 and 2 for example as you say, you might not have as much spell power as ud like but everyone else also has low hp pools.
---
#somechanges
---
Yeah good point. I’m actually going to delete my P server clients so I won’t tempted to play around till classic
---
They called Blizzard a madman...
---
Major druid drawbacks:
---
- typically fewer 40-man raid slots than any other class (1-2 usually, 3 at most)  
---
- On account of said lack of raid slots, sometimes you spend a lot of "healing" in raids actually buffing mark/thorns/keeping up faerie fire  
---
- Your healing throughput will generally be much lower than priest or shaman or pally  
---
- You lack significant AoE abilities (both DPS and healing wise)
---
- No OOC res so you are less desirable as a solo PVE healer
---
Major druid upsides: 
---
- If you do get a consistent spot in raids you will get geared very quickly
---
- Your general cc-application/escape abilities coupled with your options for stealth / tankiness/ self-healing and increased movement speed make you a force to be reckoned with in solo and raid pvp  
---
- For whatever reason druids seem to get scarcer as a server ages so you might be pretty popular in PVE/PVP as time goes on
---
If you're looking for big crits though, druid ain't the class to be. If you want to be able to do a bit of everything while understanding you probably won't be a heavy hitter at any of it, it's perfect.
---
They purposely added it in. I don't think it's going away.
---
You never played mordhau, go play it and you shall be satiate
---
Alliance being better than horde is pretty much a vanilla thing, so nothing wrong with that
---
Nearly same question over here. Just played warlock on pserver till 15. It felt pretty slow in kill speed tbh. Hunter will be fked if the leeway thing stays. Rogue is a pain to level. I just dont know what to pick...
---
Always hope for some kind of post Naxx content. Fingers crossed.
---
I’m a little embarrassed to say this but when the stress test came out last week I played 17 hours straight on the first day with a friend of mine 😂
---
Downranking also quite useful when trying to proc armor buff on tank.
---
not sure if this will work in classic, but if you use https://classicdb.ch/?item=13347 while on a gyphon, it will kill you and put your ghost back at the gy near where you first took the flight path. useful if you start a long flight and forgot something / have to go back and don't want to wait and hearth
---
Isnt being casual friendly such as not losing exp the whole point of wow?
---
I'm trying to find the video now. It was so long ago and a really weird title. Showed a guy getting to a really decent level within like an hour. I'm continuing the search.
---
ZG is always puggable, that’s the way most people do it in the server honestly, since it’s only 20 man you can’t get your whole guild to do it most of the time.
---
The rest I expect will be hard to pug AT FIRST, but will be definitely doable as people get more gear, etc. 
---
I’ve heard of AQ pugs, but I would honestly be amazed if a pug clears Naxxramas. Guess we’ll just have to wait and see!
---
Back in 2004/2005 I played with a dude named Cauthonluck on Frostwolf. I wonder if it's the same person.
---
I don't see this being any different than instant cast spells tho. Call it what you want I guess, but I heard others decribe leeway as something else. I would describe this as something else, if you see it happen client side, then it's gonna happen server side. And leeway could only be applied to things that have noticeable cast times.
---
Haha that's awesome!
---
True. It's almost impossible to do as accurately as frostbolts.
---
You’re not getting language specific realms because the whole of EU is only getting 3-5 realms to ensure each realm has a sustainable population throughout the lifecycle of WoW Classic.
---
It’s that simple.
---
It's still an incorrect perception. There's like 1 negative topic in the first 10.
---
Add on top of that that negative news is always more popular than popular and that people tend to discuss more in negative topics. Really, it's all perception. 
---
9 out of 10 Classic players are incredibly hyped for Classic and will login on day #1 and have a blast.

Any time you're in the 10-20 zone adjacent to the newb zone and it puts u back in the newb zone and you have to run all the fuck the way around and it takes like 9-10 minutes.

Yep 100% agreed that it’s one of their reasoning. Even a bunch of streamers are saying the beta is dead too.  I’m glad I didn’t get invited, as I mentioned above I played 17 hours straight on lasts week stress test (embarrassed to admit that lol) can’t imagine what I’d be doing if I had beta access..
---
PUBG and Forza Horizon 4
---
&gt; lol I can taste the rogue's salt from here
---
I'm sure he was pissed. He vanished trying to avoid death, while standing in my consecration.  I then hammered him and I did /lol while he died.
---
I really want to roll a Shaman. Is it true that if you re-spec from Enhancement to Ele/Resto you'll have to retrain your two-handed weapon skill all over again each time?
---
Nice work there! 
---
And no freezing band, which all BiS list for mage have and only 1% of mages (or less) will get their hands on.
---
It sounds so min/max thing to already decide what drops ppl get for something as simple as a dungeon run.
---
Heck tons of ppl wont even know what drops off bosses so that just means they dont get an invite?
---
If shit drops, you roll for it plain and simple, the only rule there should be is not roll for stuff you dont Need.
---
That was me. 30-40 is just such a chore to slog through, and then 40-50 isn't much better. And by that time you've seen a couple other characters running around that gave you a cool idea for an alt... and the cycle continues.
---
It might not be fixed because **melee lee-way was in fact in vanilla**(was stated by a few devs already). So if blizz changes the current melee lee-way then they are going against #nochanges.
---
Sounds like a dude I would be friends with. Hopefully you run into him again on Classic!
---
Yes, ehm I... I mean a friend, really would like to know which one you are talking about.
---
I have been playing Arma 3 with they boys.
---
my point is it's much harder to get away (e.g. by running faster or unforseen movement) if the melee range is 10yrd for a Tauren warrior.
---
I remember back in vanilla being chased by a rogue on his epic mount when I was still riding 60%, I got away because everytime he dismounted to attack, I suddenly changed firections and got out of melee range before he could stun me. that's not gonna be possible with 10yrd melee range.
---
https://youtu.be/rscZrZ4JppY
---
I found the concept, but there's another video that goes into so much more detail.
---
Agreed! I didn't even bother with a mention.
---
Awesome, thanks for the thorough post! I think I can sacrifice big crits to allow me to have ranged and some heals. I was always a shaman main in retail, and having all 3 roles was super nice. Unfortunately I will be going alliance so no shaman for me.
---
Cross-faction teamwork is against the ToS and will get people banned, you can also not sheep tagged targets in real classic, so good luck with that.
---
Because you're not standing toe to toe with a warrior you're hitting and running. No evasion means guaranteed hamstring and MS, evasion means a guaranteed overpower, you want to make sure they're in combat at all times unless you're in stealth and want to try to make an intercept impossible.
---
Those words brought more happiness to me than anything else has in the past years. Feelsgood/badman
---
Ye sure, I'm not arguing that ;) 
---
I just said that in the stream I saw he wasn't doing it for that reason.
---
I played Warrior through Vanilla up to BFA. I love Warrior. I love Tanking in PvE and being a utility/support in PvP as a Prot Warrior.
---
Having limited playtime these days I don't think I can dedicated as much time to being a MT Warrior as I could years ago and fear that I'll just fall behind all the hundreds of other Warriors.
---
I love the Paladin armor sets and I love the Druid playstyle. I know I can tank 5 man's on either of these to give me my PvE fix.
---
Convince me to play either of those over a Warrior.
---
Bold of you to assume that Classic+ would be better and more popular than TBC. You hate Retail but you trust the Retail team to make a version of TBC that is more Vanilla team than the expansion designed by the Vanilla (remember this - the team that made vanilla made TBC. TBC is their vision of what Classic+ is, because they made it). What?
---
its pretty bad man, you can be meleeing a hunter while they are shooting you at the border of there range dead zone. and if you're a tauren well you have even more melee range.
---
Anybody else going for that Bloodsail Admiral title? I grinded for it back in Wrath and its my favorite title to use.
---
lmao they must be really underestimating demand if whole of EU gets only 3-5 realms...language problems aside...we will have too many people and layering definitely won't be going like that...it sucks
---
It won't be a struggle to find a group, but those three classes aren't as sought for 5 mans as the others. Mage is the list sought pure dps for 5 mans, as they have strong cc, dps, and water. 
---
Tanks and to a lesser extent healers will be the most sought after class for groups, and they all pvp well too. So, if that's the main thing you worry about, being able to pvp and find a group, go with a healer or a tank.
---

---
And you really think 5 realms are enough when they're aiming for 3k people per serv? You reaaaaally think there's only 15k players in the EU? There's room for more, definitely.
---
An average player will spend 3 month getting to level 60..... I am not sure rest every 6 months or even a year is a good idea. Part of Classic hype is 99.9% of ppl never saw the endgame content. Now they can see what it was all about.
---
Thanks! Since we are so good at WSG, what would druids role be in AB/AV?
---
Massive DS’s fanboy here. 
---
Is this your first playthrough?
---
Dark souls reminds me of classic actually in regards to the challenge
---
So...no change since we last heard?
---
What are the opinions on it?
---
They aren't until you consider that this would leave horde with only one tank spec
---
There are some crit values that your mages should hit to keep it rolling, beyond that I don't really know. As long as someone crits it will keep rolling forever.
---
Bloodsail admirals hat and clothes
---
yes, the company that payed off so many politicians they made corporations people just so they can retain ownership of the image of a rat. at this point i think they have copyright hit squads.
---
Better to underestimate and create more realms down the road than to overestimate and have to merge realms later.
---
I actually bought it two weeks ago. The campaign was okay but I’m really enjoying the MP, although it’s hard to find servers here in AUS...
---
Not really, it is clearly marked with " "
---
Oh I don't mean all servers be like this but a server or two set aside for those players
---
I'll just leave this here: https://classicdb.ch/?item=19120
---
That's what I'm thinking too. I need to get out of the retail DPS/HPS mentality and realise classic is much more than that. I better not be caught fighting mid in WSG!
---
&gt; What I DID see happen, was people create groups so they wouldn't have to roll. For example, a clothie would make sure he was the only cloth member in the group to be sure if it dropped, it was his.
---
Yep, we did this aswell back then, worked fine.
---
Which means another filter. Across the population if you need a tank AND it has to be a spanish player, there'll be more choice if you have a spanish specific server...
---
I heard yes but I don't play shamanian
---
I actually didn't forget it, but I didn't have any percents left hahaha
---
I never said PvP was great in BFA, just that if rated PvP is someone's main interest I'd recommend BFA over Classic. I stopped playing when 8.1 came out largely because that patch made PvP worse imo. PvP in 8.0 was actually pretty good.
---
And no I'm not linking you my armory, I don't care, don't believe me.
---
&gt; Even human paladins can cleanse so easily you’d have to be really bad to let a hunter mana drain you.
---
It's more than kiting than just the manastings alone.  Also, my favorite tactic as a hunter is to spam rank 1 stings on pallys, cleanse has a pretty high mana cost and I literately get them to cleanse themselves out of mana.  And if they refuse to clease, I mana drain them.

Choi was the warrior.  I played horde on TL.

&gt; C. Getting on a random server on day one and its follow-up
---
To comment on this, our subreddit is communicating with the various language communities to establish **unofficial** language servers, which we will make abundantly clear and know in the within the subreddit, the Blizzard forums, and the respective communities. While this does not help those who do not visit our subreddit or the Blizzard forums, we hop to minimize this being an issue.
---
Running a risk of ppl rolling on those servers without knowing the reset. It is usually a bad idea to rest, much easier to launch a new server every 6 months or so this way anyone from any server can participate if they wish to and you are not forcing anyone.
---
Progressing through Naxx on a private server. Lots of people are leaving though so it's hard to keep it going. We'll probably throw in the towel soon and prepare for Classic. Other than that I recently got into SC2 again. It's a pain to see just how far your skills have dropped after a few years break but it's still super fun!
---
I always thought Hydraxian Waterlords was such a cool name
---
I agree with your observation on human/nelf models and starting areas. Especially if she has no plans to hardcore it, race doesn't matter.
---
I find for players like her, support classes tend to be a betrer fit. Of three (priest druid pally) I would recommend priest. She'll have a clearly defined role and will generally be less gimped out of a healer than druid. Pally would be my next choice, but I'm willing to bet the rp aspect of priest and their roles might appeal more.
---
Yea my sister informed me it was Greymane. 
---
The only guilds I remember was Crimson who was #1, Exousia who was #2 and then Aurum and I think Phoenix fought for the #3 position. Aurum switched servers at some point though to Ysera and my memory is not great so I might be mixing things up lol  
---
Apparently Aurum was made up of ex Crimson members when they joined the server. From my understanding as I was not part of this when Crimson Wave joined Greymane they wanted to be more hardcore and many of the guild didnt so it split into two guilds Crimson and Aurum. I joined after this happened since this was early on in WoW so I dont know the specifics.
---
The biggest draw back is that although it has a little bit of everything, its not particularly good at anything other than healing. 
---
You'd likely be playing feral until 60, and then switching to resto if you want to raid. Not to say feral isn't ever played, its just harder to compete as feral, so most guilds aren't likely to take you. However, you do bring innervate and rebirth, so you are valuable in that regard for sure.
---
In PvP you are a WSG god, being the primary flag carrier. In wPvP, you kind of just dot people with moonfire/bleeds and kite them indefinitely.
---
In terms of QoL, having healing spells cuts down on eating time and costs, and travel form at 30 makes you one of the fastest levellers in the game. 
---
Basically, Jack of trades master of none. Just remember that in order to play druid to your fullest, you are gonna be bouncing between forms and using spells from different specs.
---
My average country wages are 8-9x smaller than the US.
---
So...no...
---
It's been a major battle in me to play at all, I've always been on private servers.
---
I want to tank on a warrior. But I work 50 hours a week... Should I just give up and play something that requires less time? I've heard you have to no-life to be a raid tank. (I wish I could play wow full time ;_;)
---
Or maybe the dude she was with was manipulative and took advantage of her self esteem issues and made her feel like she couldn't be more in order to get her to stick around? Knowing some people I've played with I feel like it's far more likely lol. Lots of shit birds out there. Overall, I'd say the new guy improved her life drastically through fitness over the old guy only playing wow, so that's my line of thinking.
---
and totally ignore that some people don't speak english, or don't want to speak english and will do what they want, since this "English only rule will not be enforced.
---
You can flip flags in AB since you got stealth. As for AV, I don't think there is any class that brings something especially good to the table. I suppose that beartanking should work well on the AV bosses.
---
I will be focusing on one character this time rather than spreading myself thin. I think it will be easier to make a name for yourself at 60 if you get there early and establish yourself. 
---
And I take it either your druid friend doesn't want to tank or the shaman doesn't want to heal?  Coordinating with that many friends can be hard as you level.
---
MP is awesome. But I lost the incentive to play alone. As there are too much people who just rush in and do stupid illogical stuff. So I’m getting angry. Nowadays I just chill with my friends with the occasional rage when the abilities don’t work, haha. By god this game is buggy. But with todays update, there seem to be some fixes, although I may just have been lucky that everything worked.
---
Frankly classes were less homogeneous in TBC than they were in Vanilla. Healers had larger toolkits and played far more differently than each other, locks and mages were made more unique instead of just casters throwing blue or black balls, hunters could actually bring their pets to a raid making them more different than the rest of the dps, and warriors, druids, and paladins all had very different tanking styles with different tradeoffs. TBC was frankly the least homogeneous version of WoW ever.
---
People blame flying mounts, LFG, etc. but I really think expansions ruined WoW. Expansions make SO MUCH previous content useless. They also nullify so much progress.
---
Why bother doing anything more serious than a bit of casual raiding, when you know a new expansion comes out every couple of years that makes everything you earned fucking worthless?
---
Expansions completely stomp on any sense of achievement and progress.
---
We don’t know what concurrent realm population Blizzard is aiming for after Layering is removed. It could be 2.5k, it could be 3k, it could be 3.5k, it could be 5k. It’s whatever Blizzard decides creates the best experience.
---
5 realms could allow 25,000 players online at the same time without Layering. Sounds about right. Blizzard obviously has better estimates than we do they decided on giving each region only a handful of realms.
---
It's basically just an expansion specific currency to give your character upgrades.
---
Enjoying the game is odd logic
---
Nah I know I got you fam, no arguing here. Just elaborating.
---
My wife and I are looking at levelling together and eventually getting into raiding at a decent level.
---
We are thinking warrior/priest might be a good combo for this for both levelling and sorting out quick dungeon groups at 60 and being decent classes for raiding.
---
I was a warlock in vanilla and whilst I love being a warlock I do remember essentially wearing the lettering off of my 3 key from it being pressed all night in raids.
---
I’d be interested in taking on a MT/OT role in raids as a warrior and I assume holy will be the best spec for a priest, but are there any other class combos that would work well for us, both for levelling and end game?
---
Following on from that, which faction is going to be better represented in the raiding scene, I’ve got a soft spot for being alliance as that’s where my nostalgia is at, but if horde is optimal for raiding group quality we might prefer to go that way?
---
I know if we are alliance then we are looking at human/dwarf for races probably, but what about horde race combos?
---
Finally what profession combos are gonna be best for us?
---
I’m doing a lot of research on the side but would appreciate advice tailored to our specific requirements!
---
Really excited for the launch!!
---
Haha love this!
---
Absolutely agree. My thoughts (I already posted that in some comment elsewhere):
---
The main problem I see is that there will be unofficial German, French, Spanish, Italian, &lt;insert fav language&gt; servers after some weeks and I don‘t want to be the german guy realising I rolled 40 levels on the now French (or Italian w/e) server (you already said that).
---
Also, as you mentioned, there are players not so or not at all familiar with english. They will be **excluded** from the community as this is in fact a **language barrier**. Exclusion is not really what Classic means to us and **we need language-separated realms** to prevent this. What is even worse is: even if people speak english they‘d have to learn all abbreviations, colloquial talk and gamer vocabulary first to know what the fuck people are talking about. This is a **catastrophe** and will prevent people from playing Classic at all!
---
**@Blizzard: Please, you need to reconsider this.** Language specific servers are one of the most important changes I've been looking forward to in comparison to private servers.
---
If you eat a poly with no buffs or shields up yea you lose to a mage, that is on you. The matchup favors sp its not a contest.
---
Getting dots on a mage (especially some ele spec) is guaranteed to force a block. You can end the fight if you have a tidal charm. Having silence and fear prevents mage from securing a kill. They dont have enough sustain. All of these expert opinions appear to be based off of those level 40 duels people watch streams of.
---
All these hypothetical situations dont account for the fact that a mage has maybe 5 globals before they die to dots.
---
We don't know the motive do we though? For all we know she might have been depressed and he motivated her by saying it's something that could be fixed
---
I leveled a dwarf priest after being 60 on my rogue for a few months not getting groups because there were too many rogues on my server. Doesn't matter how good I played when they were everywhere. 
---
Within a week of hitting 60 on that priest I was raiding MC. I still have THE staff on my priest, never leveled him in BC cause I really had too much fun in PvP on the rogue during the BC pre-release and convinced my guild I would be awesome as a rogue instead. 
---
Shit, if my friends don't make me go horde, I'm going dwarf priest again. I like the race and class combo.
---
I thought about this and will add the same response in the post: as you say, people who are not on reddit (that's a lot of people I'm sure you know that) will end up on an unofficial foreign server... This is clearly a good way for most people but will create minorities anyway.
---
Frost Mages fuck up hunters pretty bad in Vanilla 1v1, it isn't like future expansions where Hunters counter Mages.
---
Not to mention being able to charge -&gt; Zerker stance once you get Whirl Wind and not lose your rage is a huge dps boost. Once you get whirlwind and Sweeping Strikes, you almost always want to pull two mobs at a time. If you're leveling with a healer, this is absolutely the best way to level as the rage degen is your own downside because with two mobs you'll need to eat after each pull.
---
I haven't played Pservers but from what I've read MC and Ony are completely Pug friendly. Every fight.
---
I know in Vanilla MC and Ony was being Pugged by 1.12.
---
Didn't they add this functionality at some point in classic via the /dismount command instead of the neat lil button we have in beta?
---
IIRC, you used to use the logout trick but after a patch, it was as easy as typing /dismount
---
Oh yeah I am most likely dropping Classic straight for a month when Cyberpunk drops lol.
---
Here's a taste of current wow mentality:

Definitely not playing hunter. I'm REALLY REALLY not gonna be happy with ammo. I'll hear the sound of losing money with every shot.
---
**&lt;Azoic&gt; recruiting for classic - EU HORDE 2 day raiding guild**
---
\- With the re-release of classic we're 5 danes wanting to form a community to raid, world pvp, hangout and other good stuff. we intend to raid 1-2 days per week (probably 2). we'd like a chilled atmosphere where you'll have the time to study, work or whatever you need time for and still be raiding at a somewhat high level, **some of us have exp up to top 25 world on live servers so you'll be in good hands**. with the fact that we guys know each other there won't be any ninja looting, drama or jazz like that. **(we'll probably end up using loot council but we haven't decided yet)**
---
\- **for now the set** **raiding times will be 19.00-23.00 CEST thursdays and sundays** **(this can be changed)** we'd like our raiding atmosphere to be really "down to earth" in the way of people wanting to show up more than "having" to. we want people to be able to go to exams, do their work etc. without being thrown off the raid team, this is also why we're aiming to get around 45-50 people in our core raiding team so raiding won't feel extreamly mandatory.This being said we ofc would want people to show up as much as possible and loot will be distributed for people that show up more than others, and we'll prio items like thunderfury for prot warriors.
---
**-** \*\*requirements and what we expect from you:\*\*we except you to try and stay to 1 class and keep that up to date and not play 10 class with white gear going into raid (should be fairly obvious)other than that it's a big plus if you have any form of raiding experience so you know your way around things.we'll be discussing professions for everyone and things like that before launch so dont worry too much about that.
---
\- we'd like people to be 18+ of age (can take exceptions if you're 2 friends thats 20 and 17 for instance)- decent attitude towards raiding (we dont want people that drag others down, but at the same time we want people that take raiding serious so we can actually progress)
---
**-** \*\*how to apply and reach out for us:\*\*you can add my discord on Daniel/shrum#8973
---
if you came this far, i hope you consider joining our ranks to become the best 2 day raiding guild out there.have a great day, GM Daniel
---
Neutrality zone violating scum!
---
What guild(s) were you in?
---
I forgot about population differences. Not looking forward to long queues =\
---
What a lame person to get that mad over that
---
Back in classic I'll gonna play with my big brother. in 2005 he decided to play alliance and I've been horde. This time we're going to play same faction thats for sure. Like in 2005 he is going to roll a hunter again and I am pretty unsure - thats why I am here. Focus will be mainly on pvp (a lot wpvp) and a bit on pve - like 70/30.
---
My choices atm are:
---
Warlock 
---
good for leveling, high skill cap, free mount, easy farming and combined with an orc - pretty much a nightmare for enemys.
---
The lock felt like he has a pretty low kill speed during leveling, but honestly ive only leveled to just 20.
---
Hunter
---
good for leveling as well, high skill cap, good mobility, easy farming, king of the jungle (wpvp) and pretty good in soloing dungeons later on.
---
Played to 20 as well, but it felt a lot quicker than the lock mainly because hes not that stationary.
---
Rogue
---
Badass, hard leveler, utility will be needed to some point, nice ganker in open pvp and has stealth for combo runs with my brother in 60 dungeons.
---
Leveled to 20 as well, was a pain to level so far. Does it get better?
---
What do you guys think - what should I pick? Thanks in advance!
---
I mean, if someone say's "Hey, I'm looking for an online competitive PvP game, what should I play?". THen no, WoW wouldn't be my recommendation. If someone say's "I want to play WoW, and I think I want to mainly focus on rated PvP." Then I would obviously recommend retail over Classic.
---
That’s not going to work. There won’t be enough servers to go around.
---
A hat that allows you to summon a parrot.
---
But... but ... windfury!
---
No other shield (thats relatively easy to acquire) has FR on it, if your tanking or expected to tank in MC yes you want +Def on every piece you can get but for the content your doing your building a FR resist set so yeah the FR has alot to do with it.
---
Es verdad.
---
I can't see the appeal of only international servers altogether. The decision is lose - lose situation for the community.
---
In Vanilla there were language specific realms and international realms. People that didn't want to speak their language or preferred to play with people all over europe still could choose to roll on an international server. that meant they knew what they signed up for and that they were expected to speak english. If you didn't feel like spending your free time speaking in a foreign language you could just roll on a language specific server. 
---
What we have now are three groups:
---
1. people that want to speak in their native language and want language specific servers
---
2. people that want to play on international servers and are worried, that their server might become an unofficial language server where the majority won't speak english
---
3. people that can't think up more than "lol, no english in 2019"
---
Watch your back, (Watch your Instance after Months Behind ninjad our BWL lockout)
---
Part 2 was great (except for the music). Abilities like Blessing of Sacrifice are just **fun** to have in your tool set.
---
Co op? Or MP? I think I own that one, or whichever one gave you access to the original dayz
---
Reason I don't wanna go lock is cause I'll be human. And you know at least a third, if not more of horde will be undead.
---
Good on ya bro. Sometimes people just need that kick in the ass to get their lives together. Do what you can but at the end of the day this phrase is crystallized truth:
---
The only person who can fix you, is you.
---
Some people don't want to fix themselves, or think they can't do it. Others need a bit of motivation to get started. Maybe you can be his motivation.
---
Also back in the days, the client had some name in English, even though most of the game was translated (I think we say "Localized"? not sure). Then at some point Blizzard decided to 100% translate all items/monsters/Npc etc , so Ironforge became Forgefer, Stormwind became Hurlevent...
---
The point is, they decided a few years after releasing the game to change that, but now they refuse to deal with the consequence of this as the Names have all been changed and forgotten . They should stay true to this, and as a conclusion stick with language-specific  servers. That's my argument.
---
Is that really helpful though? Seems like you wouldn't be saving time at all, the run to Xroad from Durotar isn't long at all
---
Consider this: The increased parry chance also results in the boss attacking more often due to how parry works. Therefore the MT receives more Damage --&gt; more Rage --&gt; more threat. A fury warrior won't be able to pull threat off of a tank that spams HS / Bloodthirst / revenge and sunder - all that while dual wielding with 5/5 defiance. Even if he spams HS - which you do not do - you use Bloodthirst on CD, WW on CD and your excess rage gets dumped into HS - which will be more the better your gear gets - but the tank gear should get better faster if the guild leadership has 2 working braincells.
---
AQ20 as well. Once people get more geared you'll see BWL and AQ40 pugs as well but they will probably be the kind of pug where half the raid is from the guild or is a set team. So a bit more carefully planned pug than just inviting 39 randoms.
---
bro I'm playing Minecraft Beta again
---
I agree. I want OSRS but for WoW.
---
Two accounts (both paid for ofc) running on the same box (might vpn one just to be safe, so I guess not technically dual-box) with strategic keybinding. Half the keyboard will be bound for one char, the other half for the other, with certain important keys/functions sharing the same keybind. 
---
I've never done it before but have heard from others of this set up working -- just never seen it in action.
---
Unsure why I am being downvoted. Not planning on running instances or bgs with the account. Multi-boxing is not against Blizzard ToS.
---
It’s gonna depend a lot on how layering works. Depending on the final form of layering the economy could be unlike anything we’ve seen both in private servers and retail vanilla. It’s really hard to say until we have that information.
---
Yep I’m on the same boat.
---
I started a level one character With a friend on retail last week for fun, we made it to 7 before we got bored. 
---
When the stress test came out last week on my day off, we played it too.
---
17. Hours. Later....
---
I envy you
---
That's very interesting, and I'll add it right away, thanks for your contribution :)
---
Kevin Jordan on Countdown to Classic discussing warlock design is where this answer comes from. Sorry I dont have a time stamp but the entire interview with Kevin is great.
---
 https://youtu.be/5-OSVVWQ_a4
---
woah? don't you lie to me cuz I'll go do it
---
Yes, it’s because everything sucks if it’s not wow classic!
---
There is truly no point in doing almost anything else, but waiting for WoW classic.
---
I'm still not really sold on the idea to expand classic beyond 1.12 content.
---
Whats the point? Isn't there TBC for this? TBC was the best expansion anyway, any further content development would just postpone classic TBC servers...
---
Crimson sounds vaguely familiar. 
---
As far as Altera Vita was concerned, I was with them briefly in AQ40 and I can say for certain they were above Exousia. I was in Exousia for backhalf of AQ and all of Naxx, so I can't say if AV was still a guild at that point, and how progressed they were.
---
Exousia taught me two good things though. #1, you can absolutely overcome inherent skill gaps with a fuckton of wipes and effort...it just sucks. #2 Draw a line on what you will and won't do for progression, and *stick to it*.
---
Definitely not. Razorgore, Vaelstrazs and Broodlord is harder than all the bosses in MC.
---
That being said, I'm positive there will be BWL clearing pugs aswell.
---
This happened to me. First class was hunter, got him to 54 after like a year because of so many alts baring in mind I was 12 at the time. Luckily I've been on P servers getting various chars to 20 and want to do priest, I love high sustain characters and healing now thanks to MOBAs and will probably alt a hunter.
---
Karazan, Hyjal, Azhara, Sunwell (but BE are nuetral non-playable this time), Uldum...
---
Great to hear :)
---
No, but my first playthrough was so long ago it may as well be. I agree that it scratches a similar itch.
---
Well then that is a no-go because shamans *are* totems. 
---
I mean, what do you want to do. Do you want to heal or DPS? And how important is bursting if the answer is DPS? Because short of being shaman there aren't much options to burst and heal.
---
Better in every way except for racial abilities.
---
Teamfight Tactics comes out today, I will probably give that a shot and hope it can keep my attention for a month or so. But I've also been playing private servers practically non-stop. Got a rogue up to 41 but now I'm worried about burn out so I'm trying to slow down a bit.
---
Do not mention its name!
---
I.... What?
---
The grind though
---
You could tank up to raids and then DPS in raids. Also a casual guild might just let you off tank
---
Hi thanks for the reply!
---
What raid times/days are you guys planning for?
---
I agree with the concept of letting her pick and then you picking something that compliments her choice.  The only thing i'd say is she probably shouldn't be a warrior LOL.  There will be high expectations for any warrior in groups.  
---
I also agree that it doesn't much matter which two classes you are.  In classic the benefits of grouping up come regardless of which classes.  If anything, maybe make sure you don't have classes that are competing for the same gear types.
---
How as a "vehicle" they had their own health, so you wouldn't take fall damage on your 'Hog.
---
Been waiting for TFT, hopefully that and the new FFXIV expansion will be enough to hold me over for two months until classic.
---
While I really appreciate this and will make use of this when the time comes, this really is a workaround that shows that we should have language specific servers. People who want a general server should maybe also get one. But forcing everybody really does not feel like creating good communities and including everyone regardless of language education etc.
---
Can't wait to get perma-dazed in battlegrounds because some hunter runs around with Aspect of the Cheetah for the whole group...
---
Yea we left the server around the time AQ40 opened since server transfers opened for Greymane around that time and we moved to Ysera so it's likely we left before Altera Vita became #1. Also possible Crimson left the server as well I dont know.  
---
I do know that Crimson got world first on one of the fights in WoTLK on the test realm though so I would assume they would've still been #1 or #2 if they were on the server after we left.
---
Thats the thing. I dont know how much I'll enjoy healing. If its real fun I wouldn't mind going healer main. But I do like bursting people down too. I mained mage in vanilla and had a blast. I don't think I want to mage again though.
---
I'm with you on the language barrier. Back in 06(I know things may be different now) a lot of people just had a hard time to make themselves understood because their first language was something other then English. I was guilty of this as well. Wow was my first mmo, and for the longest time I kept to my irl friends as much as I could for group content, as I was 15 and wasn't super fluent in English.
---
Sidenote; wow helped me go from a G(comparable to a C) to MVG(comparable to an A) in English in less then 6 months.
---
True true and very true, all true.
---
That's a fine conjecture, but since there aren't any comms in the video you cant definitively say.
---
Druid tank all the way to raid, then heal or off tank
---
While I am not saying every language is going to be able to have their own server - with proper coordination like I said we can minimize the issue. 
---
I'm all for having language specific servers. However we have to work with the cards we are dealt. For the time being, this is out best solution.
---
Dynamic respawn timers and [shit like that](https://www.twitch.tv/jokerdtv/clip/FunCrunchyMangoItsBoshyTime?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) is all you need to know about that mage's "record". 
---
It's really all you need to know and I'd take private server times with a massive grain of salt.
---
That said, I am pretty sure whoever gets the first 60 will find some sort of way to cheese it either way.
---
We have to work with the cards we are dealt. For the time being, this is out best solution.
---
Con certeza es, y tambien seria muy mas agradable de juegar con mas gente de su communidad, no seria?
---
Why though?
---
Yeah, it really is the class for someone who wants to do a bit of everything, even within a raid and without respeccing. I was strongly considering maining druid but the siren call of fat pve deeps has lured me over to the fury warrior side.
---
I remember when I made my first ability. I was doing a sort of necromancer/inquisitor build with some other magic on the side. I got creative and... RAINING BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
---
Overpower is less damage then white hits + normal hits + the occasional overpower that occurs anyway.
---
Being a Main Tank requires a hefty commitment, but any guild is going to need a solid roster of OT/DPS Warriors. And groups are always going to need tanks for 5-mans. Go for it.
---
Chests in the world despawn after ~5 minutes or so after being partially looted.
---
interesting way to see it
---
That's because you didn't see the friendly rogue stealth by instead of attacking ;)
---
Agreed for sure, that's why I'm pushing this post, hoping for an official better solution. It's also not your work you deal with their mess, tbh!
---
I already said that in my posts thanks for your input though.
---
It's VC though when you're in IF.
---
Okay and the people who buy the gold will interact with those money sinks.
---
Me and my friends played it religiously last year and the year before. Probably amassed over 2k games or something like that. We had stopped but were all pretty gutted to hear about it being put into "maintenance mode." How is it nowadays? Does it feel dead?
---
If you're going to just pvp as a warlock here's a bit of advice. 
---
Roll horde, will of the forsaken will piss you off if you're alliance. 
---
Be prepared to be pooped on until you have gear. A lot of the warlock kit relies on face tanking. 
---
If she's rolling a rogue honestly I would roll a druid. Leveling up will be easy, you can spot heal as needed, you can tank dungeons which will help her find a group. The only downside is you share leather which kindve sucks. However at 60 the rogue druid stealth combo can do some farming tricks on LBRS first 2 bosses. 
---
If not druid I would consider shaman, paladin and priest is very good too.
---
You don't have to, in the time it took him to upload the campic to imgur he could've xfered the screenshot via discord, hangouts, email, or simply uploaded it on the pc and sent the url via any chat program
---
Learning english in games is definitely a big thing, but in FPS it makes more sense than in an RPG I think, with this item and locations problem. That's just an opinion though.
---
I disagree. This is your personal preference and I think merging realms and first trying to be language-separated  is better than adding more international realms in the future.
---
You can easily heal dungeons while levelling in full shadow spec until you get to the level60 ones. That way you can level easily and not miss out on dungeons.
---
&gt;  So this crazy mother fucker is telling his guildies NOT to buy TBC under any circumstances. That he will kick them out if he sees any of them ding 61 UNTIL they clear every Vanilla raid, including Naxx. 
---
Well THAT'S a new one! JFC.
---
as if TBC and WotLK were not instrumental to the downfall of WoW....
---
They have to do them at level right?  If they are more than 6 levels different, the rep rewards start decreasing at 20% a level until they only give 20% minimum rep.
---
Well a couple years ago they thought nobody wanted to play Classic to begin with. Not that shocking to see them continue to underestimate it. It is kinda ironic, because originally Blizzard also didn't expect WoW to be anywhere close to as successful as it ended up becoming. In a weird way, history is repeating itself.
---
IEZPKU - Ez Pk was a trash taking term when you killed someone in D2. Also I was 12
---
The Arena based dungeon is my favorite, good seeing new stuff from you
---
Exactly, agreed on all points.
---
Satisfactory is pretty... satisfactory and the only game I can play for a long time besides Classic WoW
---
&gt; sap then expose armor without breaking sap (Use sprint and run through them while hitting the expose armor keybind, it won't break sap and you should be facing the opposite way so won't hit with white damage)
---
You don't need that. You can simply face them with the edge of the character because abilities hit 180° in front of you, while auto hits only have a 160° range. The only way he could come out of Sap if you do it like this is if you have a poison procc from your EA (so either weapon swap for applying EA or don't use instant on your MH).
---
Anyone else feel like the factions in classic were the most plausible from a worldbuilding aspect?  Timbermaw Hold has always stuck out to me.  They're just some Furbolgs who control a key pipeline between some regions.  They're hostile to the player.  As a player you have to earn their respect by helping kill their hostile factions.
---
It feels so grounded.  I feel like pretty much every other later expansion never made factions which fit into the world so neatly.  TBC had like Ogri'la, Skyguards and Netherwing which were all "cool", but they really stand out as self-conscious attempts to make end game content, whereas vanilla factions felt more like optional content.  They also were more likely to make factions which don't seem to fit well into the world, they have only their own base camp which is often on a disconnected island that effects nothing else.  The Argent Dawn though has a clear and necessary goal and they aren't just sitting in someplace random, they're up against the scourge.
---
I think this kind of thing helped the sense of vanilla WoW being a true world rather than a bucket of things you should do.  Hell, even Scarlet Monastery, which isn't really a faction, felt more genuine because it was "just" some zealous humans trying to maintain themselves, rather than being a collection of a few NPCs standing around in some weird commune.
---
I'm all for regional servers. Hell, if they announced Nordic servers I'd be thrilled!
---
Felwood has the worst run backs in general.  When is why I loved PvPing there.  I could kill someone, finish my quest and then kill them again on my way out.
---
Literally this. WoW was popular when it releases partly because of how accessable and casual it was compared to the rest of the MMO market.
---
TotalBuscuit (rest his soul) had a story about an MMO where if you rolled a troll you spawned in a cave area and died if you went outside. Your character would be deleted when this happened.
---
Little off there weren’t ya?
---
Waiting on the new Fire Emblem to come out, but right now I'm just doing the Four Job Fiesta.
---
What if they base their numbers on BfA, which is doing poorly? Or on Vanilla which might have been less popular at launch in the EU? Who knows what they're based on, idk...
---
You get auto-crit, but it doesn't trigger any abilities.
---
hello PhreakSC2, would like to a chance to talk to you on discord, im the current GM of Azoic and we're aiming to be the best 2 day raiding guild on our server with a core players that played in top 25 guilds on retail. you can add me on **Daniel/shrum#8973** on discord
---
Absolutely, I still have a tiny bit of hope left that Blizzard reverts this decision, though.
---

Started playing at the end of Vanilla/start of BC (can't remember which) and I got a Blood Elf Pally to 43. Don't think I ever got any higher with the old levelling system.  
---
Took a spin recently for the first time in yeeeears and I got a character to 43 in no time at all... It just felt wrong.
---
Rework wotlk and then after that make new releases
---
There is no normal.  The economy is constantly in a state of flux due to the server meta at the time.  Early on prices will be low because the money base is small.  You may see some hoarding of future endgame materials like elemental earth.  
---
You’re probably not going to see a lot of inflation until after everyone has bought their epic mounts.
---
True, I wish you guys get one if possible as well
---
To travel in peace and escape from gankers? To AFK wherever they need to? I think I'm close!
---
Interesting, I wasn't aware of the different cones for ability and white damage thanks. I will confess sprint isn't necessary at all for it but it just makes it easier for the first few tries, I used to reliably do it just by doing a (stylish) jump.
---
I've still been doing it since Vanilla. At a certain point you can tell if you can jump up something based on how steep it is or where the corners are. Probably my favorite thing to do is explore by wall jumping. I wasn't even aware it was ever "patched out", if I'm being honest. It has been second nature to me for so long, I guess I just always knew how to do it, lol.
---
Have you considered a Troll shadow priest? You can easily heal while levelling and you get a nice PVE racial, but you're also easily as strong as an undead priest while PVPing. In the opinion of many PVPers, shadowguard is more useful in PVP than WotF/Devouring Plague.
---
This way you get the awesome female troll model with dungeon healing capability PLUS you still melt faces in PVP.
---
Yup, it's fantastic from a worldbuilding and storytelling perspective.
---
Ahh, got it.
---
Retail due to the stress test. At least until Friday, when the FFXIV Shadowbringers expansion releases. Then it's that til classic :D
---
I really like this analysis, I would love to get your take on this expanded set of factions I was throwing around on r/classicwowplus here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/comments/c5jbmm/all_the_possible_factions_of_classic_wow/
---
I absolutely agree with you.
---
For example just using the new modern graphics would be appropriate. Or an option that I can select my preferred graphics since it doesn't change the game.
---
Or the unfinished areas to be released which were planed made sense but never realised because of other content
---
Would probably make enhancement shaman a real tank spec i'd guess.
---
You can filter my replies/posts by upvotes, for the replies (Which is most of them) Just look in the 100-30 range.
---
I haven't made a post in a while, so its mostly replies. (Or within my solo/offline guide)
---
What's OSRS?
---
Yeah, it was always VC for me, too. I think it just stuck. So many people will be playing out in the world at launch that I can't imagine people will have to go to any city to recruit; there'll be plenty of people in the zone—at least for Deadmines.
---
Fair enough. I'm pvp myself as well. In my opinion, there's nothing really about NE or Tauren that has any major advantages. Skill is really the key element. It's about knowing what your toon can do and how to use it electively and knowing what your opponent's toon and is capable of. Timing is another key, but that falls under the umbrella of skill. So aside from maybe the racials, of any race, choosing a class or race usually comes down to faction allegiance and/or aesthetics.
---
I love these. I’d also add Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring as a level 60 demon dungeon and possibly another section of Stratholme (for the instance portal near the Slaughterhouse. It apparently was going to be for Naxxramas, but it doesn’t make sense as it’s on the ground).
---
halo master chief collection mostly halo ce
---
My hearth was pounding just reading this
---
Was leaning towards Druid if I decided against Warrior. 
---
Pros= Can Tank better than Paladin, Flag carrying in WSg.
---
Cons= No Judgement Teir2 sexiness + cool 2h Sword
---
Basically the ONLY thing holding me back from Paladin is not being able to Tank.
---
getting rid of layering completely
---
I was planning on going arms anyway, as tactical mastery and anger management seem like really good tanking tools, even in leveling dungeons.
---
Fucking this. I saw everyone crying about spell batching and all I could think was, "Are all of you fucking serious?" Lets say I am a rogue fighting another rogue and  my reactions are just a fraction of a second faster than my opponents but it doesn't matter because spell batching is a thing. I don't want some archaic system in place letting both actions happen because back then the servers couldn't do it correctly.  Literally intentionally gimping yourself because of nostalgia, this is no different from melee leeway and I bet Blizzard is sitting in their office thinking, "What, they wanted spell batching but now they don't want melee leeway? Its authentic!"
---
Its contradictions like this that make Blizzard sweat, no changes wants spell batching but says that melee leeway is broken. We need to get it together guys.
---
I think you confuse what outsxaling means.
---
The gear for shadowpriests literally doesn’t exist in a t3 environment.
---
Additionally, mathematically, the soellpower coefficients of their spells scales way worse, which can be viewed in the source code.
---
And of course, thrre are plenty of people in HWL gear and r14 and you can see just how terrible they are compared tommages and warlocks.
---
Fantastic. Thanks for sharing.
---
Still not working on internet explorer :(
---
im temporary no changes
---
I want the game to launch with no changes but it will get stale if nothing happens ever
---
It's possible. They have made numerous changes to their plans in response to the community. They are definitely listening.
---
BIG NEWS: People are going to have to find something new to complain and repost about
---
I'd be fine with this after a couple years of "true" wow classic.  There's so many unfinished threads in the world: Uldum, the guarded door in BRD, Corrupted Ashbringer quest, etc.
---
If they added another Blackrock Mountain raid in the style of the originals behind that door, post-Naxx content, that would be awesome.  I just don't think Blizzard has plans for that unless classic smashes all expectations and a majority wants it.
---
See you in Classic and your girlfriend in goldshire ;)
---
Damn they should sticky that thread.
---
according to the stress test, it was a talent point about 20 in, which you had to spec into to be able to use 2H axes and maces. I'm unsure if you need to train them at all in the first place as the stress test didnt go up to 40
---
Maybe now people can finally shut up about layering, when they see that it's being improved and worked on.
---
Oh who am I kidding, they're still gonna whine.
---
That's awesome! Just bought Wallpaper Engine a few days ago so I'll be trying this out.
---
Gondola type instance on the tram between SW and IF. the train pulls up to various stops and you have to clear the platform or flying mobs come in and attack the group while the tram is moving, if you fall off the tram you die. if the group wipes you start over. bosses at every other platform
---
Holy crap that dude needs to do a very violent fap after that.
---
Check Rule 4
---
AY CARAMBA
---
I'm playing with a buddy on the Netherwing private server. We are constantly saying "I wish this was real."
---
upvote just for the nice translation (spanish here)
---
&gt; I always wondered why it's so complicated to do for blizzard when a handful of motivated people managed to do it on their own without much access to as much of the original code as blizzard.
---
Because it's just not that simple. Private servers are examples of folks delivering a software service that meets service delivery expectations of 2004. Blizzard is delivering a software service from 2004 that has been adapted to meet the expectations of a software service in 2019.
---
It's not on this list, and in Vanilla WoW, it definitely wasn't A tier unless you had 1 of the 5 hardest hitting weapons in the game.
---
&gt; I was confused as first then someone explained it to me
---
Needed someone to explain it to you because it didn't make any sense to name a dungeon after the last boss. I rest my case
---
Stop hyping me lol

Current guides based on p-servers are not accurate.  When I leveled originally in vanilla, it was optimal to move onto the next mob while fighting the current mob rather than hamstring kite. Based on my 1-10 testing on the stress test that's still true.  Mobs die easier and don't hit as hard in Vanilla as they do on p-servers, thus making movement more important than damage reduction.
---
You can invite someone to a party, leave the group and get ported to graveyard. Takes a bit longer but since you clear the lashers so fast its only good that it takes longer. That way you dont get locked out.
---
I've been torn for the last few months.
---
 Paladin(holy until I can get the gear to go shockadain(aka wait 2minutes for burst) . 
---
Paladin because of lvl40 mount is free , and if I go alchemy I can get some of mats for the 60 mount arcanite bars 6of them (so 1 week or so to get it) , also doing the old Hobbs farming SM would be great . 
---
Then there is mage .. 
---
Mage pros is aoe grinding , good pve and pvp value ports , free food/Mana drinks 
---
Cons ; would be a absoulte bitch to hear for raiding also there is going to be so much completion for clothie gear , including paladins going for he odd cloth piece also need to actually save money for 40mount
---
A Chinese or Brazilian minority on a mostly English server doesn't seem like as much of an issue. In EU you'll have 3-5 languages all in big numbers and some servers potentially becoming de facto english/german/whatever, alienating everyone else. I'm in the US so it doesn't concern me personally, but I see where people are coming from.
---
In some places, they don't give unlimited credence to corporations to control people's lives.

---
That sounds great. Important question is: how long cooldown is?
---
If this is true Blizzard ought to have some timer or something in game for it. Its gonna be really frustrating for new players who cant figure out why they cant join their friends group.
---
This is a good thing though if true.
---
druids don't need MCP to hold agro lol
---
I fucking love the deep run tram idea.
---
Cool good to know
---
Yeah but the suppression room can go fuck itself
---
Thanks for the heads up. I've been kicking this idea in my head for a while now and never considered the buffs not stacking.
---
Could you explain why you would find them boring? Compared to other classes? I'm still figuring out if I want to play rogue mage or warrior in classic. Thanks.
---
I was always rolliing the 2 in this case:(
---
eating healthy, maintaining a reasonable amount of sleep, keeping yourself hydrated
---
I kind of like when there's a few rare, faction-specific things like that.  Symmetry makes the world feel contrived.
---
Farm gold, that's most important. That and hard to get recipies if you're fast to get to vendors.
---
Since the majority of players wanting gold are gonna go skinning/herb, I don't think it's viable as an optimal farming strategy. The prices will be affected be the huge amount of leather and herbs on the market, disregarding Black Lotus ofc.
---
I always do those a bit overleveled like 45ish still rough.
---
Warstomp&gt;Hibernate is an "I-win-button " vs nelf druids. Cue up a fat heal, fire off a juicy starfire, restealth, or even just just leave the fight. Always felt dirty using that combo, it was *so* good.
---
I will be letting her pick ultimately because character attachment is what will keep her playing. That being said I am going strongly discourage her from playing something like an orc warrior because warriors are very tough to play correctly with stances and the red/orange areas starting areas will be offputting for her. The goal is to have the most casual experience possible so things like Nelf wisp form=less time dead=less frustration and more likely to keep playing. I was going to play a warlock but she likes nelfs (go figure) because they are hot and women empowering. This will be my alt so I will pick something to compliment her. Right now she is leaning towards nelf hunter or rogue. I'm worried the extra management with hunter would be a lot for her (pet and ammo) but maybe it's not bad. Druid looks nice but I think being a chicken might be offputting.
---
Dude. Careful. I brought this up a month ago without even knowing it was a hot point on this sub and people fucking flipped out.
---
Hydraxian Water Lords Rep. Getting all your attunemnets and Keys.
---
We were the same.  We got C'thun down to 5% on our best try, so we almost cleared AQ40, but by then Naxx came out and people were on the verge of being burned out on WoW, so we only downed about 5 or 6 bosses in Naxx before TBC came out.  I'm also hoping to clear both this time around.
---
hablo espanol tambien, no es increible, pero se entiende bien, no? :') y portugues, ingles y frances! soy la persona la mas neutra para hablar de esta necessidad haha (xaxaxa pra ustedes) no tengo problema pra hablar con varias communidades pero no todos puedan decir la misma cosa
---
Use the lowest rank heals with the longest (3.5 second untalented?) heal spell cast time.  You get the full +healing benefit that way, and the lowest mana cost possible for it.  
---
Then do everything you can (talent and gear wise) to lower that long cast time. 
---
You can of course play around with some of the shorter 2.5/3.0 cast time spells too.
---
Hydraxian waterlord rep, attunement quests, any other reputations you can get a head start on for future phases.
---
In actual vanilla Fury was still superior to Arms for leveling, even without abusing /sit. However, Arms was close enough that it was worth going if you wanted to do any sort of PvP. Keeping your gear up to date is far more important than min-maxing your leveling talents.
---
I am super unsatisfied with the a lot of the guides out their, including this one.
---
I definitely do appreciate the effort, though. The thing is, that there almost never really is information that is somewhat out of the meta.
---
It’s always kind of the same and if even pretty important recipes are missing (like Formula: Enchant Shield - Lesser Block) it’s kind of useless from my perspective.
---
On the other hand it’s good for me that everybody seems to keep the real good niche strategies that are going to make them thousands of gold!
---
Just my 2 cents
---
Correct the very first reply on Twitter stated. Looks like the changes are made so they can keep layering longer
---
Can't exactly blame people considering it has been proved to be highly exploitable.
---
Haha that girl was prob like, IM the wife of the gm, you’re SO fucked
---
I would say that for me, it's a combination of the above.  First of all, for me, the modification of the tone of the work feels wrong.  The artist had a vision, likely spent a good long while hashing it out, and put out a beautiful piece.  If you think about it, technically it is already his take on another artists work ( the graphical artist that created the Ironforge city in Warcraft, though this is a full impressionistic take as much as looking at a real life location would be).
---
To any redditor wanting karma, we all know that it's a "strike while the iron is hot" kind of Meta.  This modification coming so shortly after the piece gained popularity screams meta.

I personally do not believe people should modify art.  The person had a vision, they created something and shared it with the world.  It lead to many people being interested in printing out their work, looking to purchase from him, etc.  Should another graffiti artist stroll up to a banksy piece out in the wild and toss something else on it to change it up?
---
You think it’s worth it to spend another 250 and get a laptop that runs with a 144hz display versus one that is only 60? I’m thinking about getting the legion y740 (something that’ll last for a long while) or the legion 530/540. What do you recommend. They’re both on sale, and anything decent with a 8gig ram and a decent graphics card is easily $700+. I dooooo however want to experience the game in near perfect quality. Thoughts ?
---
The first two fights of BWL are the heaviest on coordination, definitely not easier than anything in MC or Ony.
---
Telling you why you are wrong would compromise the gold I'm going to make on the onset of the game
---
You think they did, but they didnt.
---
Making friends with an alchemist so you can have a steady supply of flasks/elixirs for when you get into serious content... or need to carry some folks.
---
Finding your class' weakness and frinding up supplies to patch it... i.e. moonkin and spellpower flasks that persist through death. Just get a bug ol' stack of 'em.
---
Agreed, which I think is why doing it as the Ravasaur quest in a whole different zone was a better idea than just giving horde the same quest. But at the same time giving one faction something and the other faction nothing is pretty weak. 
---
Hinterlands is a great example of this, Horde has insane quality of questing here, particularly for Jintha'alor thanks to the refresh they got here mid-vanilla. Alliance otoh got jack shit. Which is a shame because Jintha'alor as a giant world dungeon you can pvp over is something really special in vanilla and it's a shame they don't do more with it.
---
Based on what information or data?
---
I mean, it would be one thing if they were adding something new to the conversation and just referencing the video, but they are just posting the video link with no new input.
---
try out tailoring / mining if you really want to get that eng up, and send all your mining matts to a bank alt while leveling so when you do hit 60 you pretty much have the matts to powerlevel yourself without needed to drop your whole bank account
---
No one said that. But with MCP you generate more threat so the whole raid can do more damage? jesus. Same reason why trolls are the best tanks on horde side. Do warriors need berserking to hold aggro? No, but with it they can generate more threat resulting in a raidwide dps increase.
---
Can get the crystals in ungoro or the plants in felwood
---
1.3 was the best
---
Damm dude, thats amazing info! thanks a lot for sharing, this will definitely help!
---
Im also thinking about rolling a mage gnome in Retail just to take a look at Alliance's cities and lore.
---
Plus Im taking a look at  [**Nobbel87**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX34tk-noBVC4WVC9qQGyMw) videos.
---
I had some wierd fascination with the word "seed"
---
My first was a paladin named Seedoflight which got to lvl 12. I made a number of seed characters but i ended up maining my priest, Seedofheal.
---
Stupid name.
---
Dayz was originally on Arma 2, we play a mix of MP and Co-op, there is a game mode called warlords that has both elements in it.
---
hotboxes are troll only mon
---
who are the defilers?
---
While you eatin fiber and taking naps imma be grinding that xp. Gonna hit 60 so fast that I'm camping you into stv.
---
That shit ain't neet, that shit ain't hardcore
---
Entirely plausible!
---
I think this change will make people more alright with layering being around for longer. It stops many of the glaring exploits.
---
Based on *blizzard bad*
---
I just found their rotation extremely rigid. I'm aware that a lot (pretty much all DPS) of Vanilla classes are like that but they get almost no procs at all to force you to pay attention. I could macro their top DPS on Patchwerk (assuming you're playing combat which is the min/max build) , now for some that's great but it wasn't for me.
---
I understand the dead weight is having fun.  The odd logic involves other tolerating the useless raid member
---
Is there a bluepost reflecting this anywhere?
---
Of course...
---
Wow this sounds truly amazing lol
---
you need to stand on the hit landing - its wonky but it works
---
Is there any other class besides rogue that constantly argues for this?
---
"I can blind someone even if I'm too slow and they fear me first"
---
"I can gouge a mage even if he blinked first"
---
It seems like every time this is brought up it is rogues who want to be able to cheese their way out of shit.
---
also the gaining XP thing seems kindof odd to me. would make it harder to group while questing. any thoughts?
---
Your view is ignorant mate, take it from a fighting game perspective. If I were to puch first and you second but it both happens at the same time regardless of if I was faster or not then how is that a good thing? If a warrior charges you then you are instantly stunned and will not be able to blind, i.e. he charged you first before you could react to blind. With spell batching he can charge but you can blind after he charges and you end up profitting from this. Why reward the person with slower reflexes?
---
BIG NEWS: People are going to keep complaining about layering, but they'll be even more wrong about what it is, how it works, and what it means for the game!
---
The most accurate source of news and statistics: the American Sources for Scholars. Better known as their ASS.
---
Based on people always needing to see the glass as half empty. 
---
I mean like third reply basically shows something like this
---
"Hey here is a report of really great improvement lets be happy"
---
"Hey why aren't you telling me about completely unrelated thing right now COME ON"
---
Gold is the most important early grind. Your epic mount is the first thing you should be doing. After that ita into atunement grinds.
---
Most important is grinding all the cloth in the world to grind that Darnassus rep for the mount period.
---
I had 20-30 ping back in the days, so you are correct that for some people ping didn't progress much.
---
Leveling.  Period.
---
also because you might be leveling. eng isnt the most cost efficient or one of the ones with immediate ROI. I'm p sure you need tailoring up to 300 to make BoS BIS chest slot, after that you can just ditch the profession unless you're wanting it for bloodvine garb in phase 3. Tail / Ench sound the best for leveling (make own GMW) or tail / gathering
---
Take your upvote
---
&gt; ...AoE/Instance...
---
This is why I also included instance grinding.  A spell cleave group is, as of writing this, considered one of the best groups for speed running instances, especially early on.  If you utilize their strength to get ahead of the pack, you can then get some of the AoE grinding spots to yourself and then stay ahead of the pack.
---
I can't blame people for being concerned, I can blame people for how obnoxiously and irritating they out those concerns.
---
What's the least played class based on polls?
---
I main healer (priest) on a pserver right now and I'll say that healer is fun in certain situations but can be very boring in others (especially when content is on farm).
---
If you enjoying bursting people then healer might not be the role for you. Healing is the only role where more is not more -- the kind of mentality that makes burst damage appealing will probably make healing boring.
---
If you wanna burst shit down, I'd say your options are rogue, 2h fury, and mage.
---
Damn you bring up a good point there, if friends are in split layers, this cooldown is pretty ridiculous. Maybe grouping in cities is not affected by the CD or something, hope they have a proper solution...
---
Thanks! We have been together for a decade and when she said she wanted to play wow with me I had a nerdgasim. She is a jock, likes working out and stuff so I didnt expect her to want to play wow with me. My friends have always said it's like the movie 'the other guys' with us and they dont know how I landed her. I have one shot to nail this experience with her so keeping it casual as possible is key.
---
Mage DPS looking for progression guild with raid times starting after 6:00pm EST. PvP server only, PvP events/days a plus. 
---
Prefer horde (for PvP) but could be persuaded to roll Ally if the guild was right. 
---
Coming back to WoW after a long back due to classic release only, been on track with several other MMOs until now. Usually run a Tank or burst dps. Min/Max guilds appreciated. 
---
tipsout is already out of jail for frauding 800k?
---
All melee dps needs to use engineering.  
---
Goblin sapper chargers, dps pets, resistance trinkets, etc.
---
Those are good items but you only need to craft them once and usually each guild assigns someone for crafting them.
---
It's not as much of a problem for Horde players. I always just saw DM + Location, and you could always shift click someone to see if they were in the level 20s or if they were 58-60. I have seen a lot of people refer to Deadmines as VC, though. As much as it kind of doesn't make sense, I think it's become iconic enough to know what people are talking about. Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill.
---
Old-school RuneScape
---
ofc its not necessary but for me personally hamstring kiting was, besides being more effective on pservers, far more engaging aswel instead of just standing idle and queuing up attacks.
---
Damn is that the way you spell it? I’ve been calling it Steam Wheel Cartel this whole time lmao but in my defense the goblins act like a cartel lol
---
Yes I hope that they see all the posts and will discuss that in their next meeting - whenever this might be.
---
NE'd on the train
---
Meh. It is highly exploitable on the beta where there are 3 people on each layer. Everything is empty so it is easy to change layers and grab whatever resource/mob/chest that you want. On release each layer would have thousands of people so it is far more likely whatever you were changing layers for would be occupied anyway. It definitely has issues but it wouldn't have been nearly as exploitable as the beta makes it seem.
---
I think he's just saying that compared to EQ, this is casual. (Which is what WoW's marketing point is)
---
Everquest is actually punishing, WoW Classic/Vanilla is not. Not to mention EQ has a ton of quests that don't just easily present themselves to you with an ! over their head. Sometimes you have to do certain actions just to trigger the quest. If you didn't know before hand, you probably missed it.
---
I played vanilla and at least on my server it was exclusively called VC. I still call it VC and usually everyone knows what I’m talking about. But I could careless if someone calls it DM. Call it whatever you want, it takes two seconds to type out the full name anyway if someone gets confused lol.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5r821/big_news_internal_cooldown_added_on_layering/
---
Not yet, but they haven't said anything about the removal of right-click reporting either.
---
Yeah, in a BETA. This is not the live game, not by a long shot, this change proves it. They're trying it out.
---
Hmm, that seems about right.
---
A gnome rogue named Shrute.
---
I'm playing a classless wow private server. Nothing is soulbound and it has a high risk mode where you can drop gear in world pvp. Extremely satisfying and really makes you think about the value of particular talents.
---
To my knowledge there has been no comment whatsoever which is the biggest problem right now. The no comment approach has lead to wild speculation and doubt. Do they refuse? Are they incapable? Is it almost fixed? Who knows?
---
It's concerning on many levels that they won't even say they are looking at it.
---
I like how your confidence stems from being able to run away better than any other class.
---
Witcher 3. Really does a good job scratching that RPG itch. World is huge so I get that exploration vibe. Lots of interesting characters to talk to.
---
So you think Blizzard will collapse the layers and allow more than 3000 people on each server?
---
and here i was thinking druid or hunter.. unless your girl really likes those supportive rolls there no reason to gimp her play experience as a pocket healer. Plus you get cute animals and if she has a pet IRL she can have that pet in game too :) lots more flavor and fun stuff with those two classes.
---
Which truthfully is fine because layers are based on populations.  If the pops are strong layering will be around a bit longer.
---
Ok, and?  Probably dozens of other people bit the bullet in that couple weeks that weren't "famous" enough to warrant a reaction.  It is sad for his friends and family, but he's an image on a screen to me.  We live in a world of over 7 billion people.  Someone is ALWAYS dying.  Someone is ALWAYS committing suicide.  Are we supposed to put everything on hold because we might upset one of those 7 billion?  Get out of your tiny headspace.  When I die, when you die, those that know us will morn and those that don't will go on without a care in the world, deal with it.  You're not special, I'm not special, and Mr. fucking dead D-list celebrity isn't special.  I know your mom and the schools told you were special, but they lied.  There is only one person to live for, yourself.  If you care about the feelings of those around you, you can live for them too.  Homeboy here stopped feeling desire.  I can't even blame him.  If he felt that bad, then he is a kindred spirit.  Life sucks and sometimes the only way to slog through it is to laugh.  You might want to try it sometime.  It might help you unclench your sphincter.
---
You want to heap scorn on me?  Take a number.
---
I believe that RIGHT when the game was launched you could enter any dungeon as a raid even though they were balanced for 5 people. UBRS was quite difficult. i can't remember if there was actually a limit of 15 players in the instance and that is whyy that was common or if that was just how many people it took to make it feel manageable when everyone was terrible. I do know that the "raiding any dungeon" thing was patched out prett quick though.
---
People shouldn't be switching so often that this ever becomes an issue.
---
CATCH THIS YOU BASTAAAAARD!
---
They may figure that by the time you leave the level 6 starting zone most will have already joined their friends layers to level with.
---
I want German servers.
---
#nochanges
---
We are going to create our inofficial servers anyway, many German Guilds already met in discord.
---
I was thinking enh, warrior or hunter so far. So you confirmed some of my ideas.
---
Just guessing, but I think the cooldown will trigger after the first jump so you can still group with friends etc...
---
Yeah, ***if*** it was going to happen, it would need to be a few years out from Classic's launch, and it would need to be on a fresh set of servers.
---
+1. Blizzard wouldn't have made these changes if people didn't rag on them. Granted, there is a line between constructive criticism and "REEE" but Blizzard has often-times tended towards not taking feedback seriously unless the playerbase is yelling in their ear so I can't blame players.
---
What special version of red did you play that allowed for 7 letters in the name? I might be wrong, but iirc, Pokemon only allowed 6 letter names.
---
I can't stop using the Zwei. My god it's fun.
---
Maybe you shouldn't spend all day reading shit you dislike. Or should no one be allowed to complain because you've decided you've seen enough people do so?
---
Because I don't particularly care about arbitrary rules.
---
I have no issues with people who choose to buy gold, they are not really buying some significant advantage over me that I would otherwise not be able to access myself.
---
Wait WHAT?
---
Isn't general consensus that 2h fury is the best for leveling?
---
You roll and the highest one wins
---
True, I mean and you got the flips. The most underrated feature in combatting ADD while leveling. Honestly the only reason I would roll night elf 😊
---
yes but what if you need to leave the group to join another in a smaller window than the CD? Hope it doesn't affect this too much, needs to be clarified just a bit imo
---
I am still deciding between Hunter or Lock on Alliance but discouraged because I don't want to deal with WOTF as the most popular race is UD for Horde players and I do like to Wpvp a lot which is why I'm leaning towards Hunter..does anybody have an Alliance Warlock POV regarding this issue...?
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Classic wow was fun when it had a small private playerbase but it will be turned into another marketing machine full of stupid pigs once again. Thanks for ruining another game sheeps.
---
Look at the size of that thing.
---
I address that in the second paragraph.
---
I totally agree. I think Razorgore is pretty doable if you've got a handful of solid group leaders, Vael is also doable if you have some really deep DPS that outgear the content, Broodlord is just a terrible fight though. Suppression room is a nightmare, whelps are very frustrating, one person not understanding aggro can easily wipe the raid, plus the chance of a tank getting randomly whacked is higher than on most fights.
---
The Drakes are all pretty easy by comparison though.
---
And it shouldn't be like that. Big pop ? Add servers, layering is fine for the first few weeks but that's all.
---
I made a post similar to this on the official classic forums. Everyone just said that I obviously know nothing about game development. And pointed me to a YouTube video of a classic panel at a Blizzcon. Like..ok that's great, but Blizzard is still one of the most experienced (and wealthy) game companies around, not to mention its their original product do they should have all the code vaulted somewhere, yet it has taken them this long to get 1.12 out.
---
Dont get me wrong, I'm gonna play the shit out of classic, already planned a few days off from work. But come on, does the dev time really need to be this lengthy?
---
He's not wrong (in theory) and neither are you.
---
Ping is largely dependent on your location to the server, not your internet speed like many might assume.  The differences in ping you might see could be due to a multitude of reasons.  But likely just more data centers that have popped up around the world, means you are usually always hitting a datacenter close by.
---
Not sure where the original US datacenter was located was back in 2004...but likely west coast.  The stress test this time you were more than likely hitting a datacenter located in the east coast.
---
Hmm... Well on a weird note, you can buy game time with in-game gold now, it asked me if I wanted to reactivate my account for 129,000 gold. Near impossible for new or returning players.
---
Or maybe Blizz is tweaking layering due to the general outrage?
---
With a fresh server there is one major component that every seems to forgot about - there is no gold at all. Yeah you could go farm stuff at low levels, or sell every you kill to a vendor but realistically the vast majority of the player base isn't going to have the extra gold to spend  at least like the previous comment said they get their epic mounts ( which is a major gold sink straight off the bat at 60)
---
Mainly Red Dead Redemption 2 and sometimes GW2.
---
Unlikely.  Your secret gold making method has already been discovered, implemented, and planned for by a number of other people.  You really ought to be considering the time value of your money while you wait for things to “normalize”.
---
I rediscovered DotA 2 a few days ago and I'm currently playing it every night with some friends. We all have had zero prior exposure to the game, so we are taking it slow. We managed to beat the bots on easy and normal, and now we are trying to get a bit better to beat them on hard. Our goal is to beat the bots on all difficulties and then move to unranked matches against other people. While it is no substitute for Classic, it sure is a fun and engaging game.
---
Same. It just was VC. There was no confusion or instruction manual required on the server. VC was Dead Mines and DM was some dungeon I'd never get a group for.
---
But I thought the game was DOA? Didn't someone on here say everything was unfixable this close to launch?
---
It's almost as if we're in some kind of testing period, if only there was a name for it..
---
this is nothing new or anything added to the conversation.. OP this post should be removed.
---
It's Need, Greed or Pass.
---
Need takes priority over Greed and Pass passes on the item completely.
---
There's also Free-for-all, Masterlooter, round-robin and a few others I can't remember.
---
Also there was no in game map if I remember correctly.  Had to draw your own.
---
Is that something we select before doing dungeons or raids?
---
It triggers when you gain xp. People gain xp so regularly that it will almost always be triggered.
---
It wont be uncommon to get xp while doing quests to then want to get invited by a friend to hang out with them or do a dungeon or something m, only to discover he cant.
---
It's not about the frequency of layer hopping, it's about the frequency of this internal CD. Its gonna always be on very reguarly.
---
That's exactly his point.
---
You mean feedback? That's what a beta is for.
---
Harry Potter must've been hilarious then
---
Well with how some guilds did dkp, having high dps got you more loot priority, then add in the fact less gear competition from another clothie, plus another innervate and brez and I could see some groups bringing one along.
---
Fuck it. Play how is fun for you to play. If that means never getting to the end game, who cares. I probably won't make it either but I like to think about it.
---
For those who don’t want to watch the whole thing, he leaves IF at 4:46:00.
---
The horde camp in felwood is on cliff next to darkshore, so if you fell of there you would die of fall damage in darkshore, which presumbaly makes it think this GY is closest. It doesn't account for the fact that you can jump down as a ghost as well though.
---
Ratchet GY...Level 60 horde will just camp the entrances to RFD and RFK just so you have to do the run. Takes about 10 minutes to make the run. Not the worst, but probably the most annoying since it was always camped.
---
Were you on broadband back then or dial up?
---
Improvement in ping for users could be due to the fact that they now can dynamically spin up servers all across the world (thanks to sharding!).  You are probably now hitting a server much closer to where you live.  The variable that effects your ping the most is always your distance to the server.
---
Good think people will buy stuff to be more efficient even though they technically don't need them.
---
It hadn't ever occurred to me that you don't have any control over your quests in the retail levelling experience, but you are dead on.
---
You literally CANNOT do quests from Sunrock Retreat in Redrock mountains if you didn't get the lead-in quests there, and that is true of basically every zone. There are WAY too many prerequisites in the modern levelling experience that make it very difficult to just wander somewhere new and find something to do
---
I mean that’s skill of the player and true for any match up. If a paladin doesn’t recognize that he’s only getting rank 1 sting and doesn’t bless wisdom to counter, he’s just not doing very good. I get how that can be the deciding factor for a lot of fights though.
---
Also, figured you might have already read my previous reply.  But I dug around some old, true vanilla, screenshots and this was a BG photo I had as my rogue.
---

---
Adding servers doesn't help. Not many people are going to abandon their character after a month or two. server x-fers will be the solution.
---
Blizzard, hire this person!
---
I assume that the cooldown starts after you jump layer. So if you login you start with no CD. At that point you will only be randomly grouping with people in your layer and joining a friends group will cause the first actual layer change.
---
Would be an issue for going between groups however but I think the idea of the system is that you should change layers rarely enough that it won't become an issue.
---
Rust requires daily time commitment just to play the base game. Otherwise your shit gets raided and tits away. No thank you to solo play.
---
The bosses maybe pug friendly, it is the trash where you have to heard cats more so that get people to lose focus, wipe and waste time.
---
Came here to say this, after someone on this sub mentioned it a month or so ago. Mordhau is so much fun.
---
pvp faction for arathi basin
---
No, it happens upon looting the corpse.
---
It's also courteous to /roll to determine who loots a chest or gets a node and stuff like that.
---
Mid-30s druid that ended up rolling hunter checking in here...
---
Planning to level a priest with my buddy as a warrior this time around so hopefully we stick it out.
---
even during, so watch out when the party leader switches to masterlooter before doing a boss, there be ninja's out there.
---
haha no you're right, that's a typo
---
It's not alot weaker. Its only 1 level lower and going nelf makes it even. Alot of rogues don't go 5/5 master of deception so as a nelf druid with 5/5 improved stealth and the pvp gloves you'll pretty much always see horde rogues first.
---
from a lacerated sky
---
Horde or Alliance as a Priest with focus on PvP? How much stroner are Undead and Troll priest racials aswell as the lack of Wotf on Alliance side compared to Alliance priests?
---
Powershifting was nerfed when furor talent and wolfshead helm where changed. But the act of powershifting has been in vanilla. So to claim this is an important bug in the spreadsheet is ridiculous.
---
I remember duskwood being really annoying. the graveyards used to be REALLY bad there. and it would happen a lot especially with patches and mor'ladim.
---
You need a lot of tanks for PvE. You don't need to be a full on MT to play Prot war. Most guilds need 2-5 geared ranks for many encounters, especially as you progress into AQ40/Naxx. A skilled offtank is almost as valuable as the Main Tank to a raid and requires far less time commitment. 
---
I say go Warrior and Roll tank - while there will be tons of other warriors, most won't be prot. Also, remember that Druids and Paladins require far more time investment and gear to tank at the same levels of as Warrior. If you're worried about limited time, rolling a non-warrior tank will be the opposite of what you're going for.
---
This is awesome. I made something that looks almost exactly like this, but yours has more details. I'll probably use this instead of mine.
---
Note: one mistake I saw -- you have Eyestalk Waist Cord as 51 Spell Dmg (should be 41)
---
Blizzard devs in 2006 faced a choice. They could keep developing and expanding upon Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, refining what they had with version 1.12 by releasing 1.13+, or they could take the playerbase on a new mission through the Dark Portal to Outland. 
---
My cynical suspicion is that the business model they were pushing at the time (selling each expansion as a fully priced game *in addition to* the monthly subscription) basically necessitated The Burning Crusade rather than WoW 1.13...you can't sell a patch for $60. It was a shrewd move to not only retain 8+ million subscribers (by the end of 2006), each paying \~$14/month, but also get that entire subscriber base to essentially repurchase the game. Additionally, that new content offered substantially more marketing material with which to attract new players than a simple patch would/could have.
---
This business model has obviously served Blizzard very well financially, and it allowed them to explore substantial changes to the core gameplay and mechanics of Vanilla (much of which I really enjoyed, TBC and the first half of WoTLK being my personal favorite periods). I don't think this in any way indicates that Vanilla 1.12 represents a "finished product", where the developers' vision had been exhausted or perfected. I think there is an entirely possible alternative history where they continue iterating on Vanilla, with 1.13, 1.14...etc.
---
Ping and Responsiveness are still largely dependent on your distance to the server.
---
However, thanks to sharding and layering, it allows them to dynamically allocate resources all over the world.  Meaning that users nowadays are likely hitting a data center much closer to them.
---
So while you are right, ping and responsiveness equations hasn't really changed, on average, people get much better ping now because they have way more cloud based datacenters to connect to.
---
Persona 5
---
Easy: no language specific servers.
---
I agree with you, but I don't see how they can possibly forecast the popularity of Classic starting during release and what it'll be like months down the road.
---
The worst thing would be for servers to be under-popped and essentially die out.  While this  will eventually happen, I don't want to see server merges disrupting communities a few months after release.
---
It has been discovered and implemented. That's why its funny you claim there is no economical difference from the day of release to two months down the road lol.
---
Go gnome rogue and stab tauren in the back
---
Read the damn twitter post. The CD triggers when gain xp, when you farm a node, when you do a lot shit that isnt layer hopping.
---
Please actually read the OP before jumping into the discussion
---
They should add killing guards at an Alliance or Horde town to the cooled internal cooldown list as well
---
5man dungeons will use Need/Greed, it is the default option when forming a party.
---
Raids will typically use Master Loot. One player is designated as the Loot Master and can manually assign a drop to any player in the raid. Using that in-game option, most guilds run their own out of game system to determine who gets the item. 
---
The two most common are DKP (Dragon Kill Points) and Loot Council. DKP is a currency system where you get points for raiding and spend them on loot. Loot Council is when a group of senior members discuss and decide who gets the item based on merit and guild need.
---
I guess I still don't really see the point of speccing arms. Things like extra crit chance &amp; improved rage generation seem much better than waiting for improved overpower &amp; impale.
---
I don’t understand. When a boss is killed they drop loot right? Is it different than what happens in retail ?
---
-checks steam library with literally hundreds of games- “ have nothing to play!
---
There's no question - if you can play a Night Elf, you play a Night Elf. Besides, Tauren are big and ugly and awful. If I was committed to playing Horde, I'd just pick a class that a Troll can play because Female Troll are the only half decent looking race they have.

It'll be more stable than 04/05 fresh servers because people will already know that what stats and items are worth selling and which arent. You won't see many int agi cloth items, for example.  Back in the day there wasn't much information on the game so it was all a crapshoot. Back then you would get people who would buy that agi int cloth but today not so much.
---
Small private playerbase lmaoooooo troll
---
Not sure if this was an insult or a compliment. I'll take it as both.
---
I'm the opposite, I'll pick one and plat the complete shit out of it for years.
---
Everyone I know played with much higher ping than they do now, sub 100 ping was almost unheard of in Vanilla.
---
Characters are tied to servers, adding more would ruin classic
---
Merges would cause another load of issues
---
Layering shouldn't be a thing after the first couple weeks due to most people not making it through level 30
---

Still not fully set on Tauren Druid... night elf is so tempting. I prefer their animal forms, their mounts...
---
I leveled a orc rogue with mace spec in Vanilla before they nerfed it.  Jesus is was OPed.  I resisted most stuns while I a non stop stunning machine.
---
I watched a video recently about a guy who played a 32 hour session on the beta. REMEMBER KIDS. Take all things in moderation. Even wow. Do a daily excercise to get your heart rate up for AT LEAST 10 minutes a day. Wow is great, but take care of your health.
---
The leader of the group or raid chooses the loot system.
---
Dungeons are often Need or Greed, while raids most often are master looted.
---
Though, some dungeons with expensive materials (Strat live) can some times be master looted aswell.
---
i'm just playing the 8.2 patch until then. besides that, leveling twinks. I was always wary of shamans mainly because i didn't like the totem mechanics. then i found elementalist. he is now level 72
---
damn you got wrecked buddy

---
Seriously!?? JUST WAIT!!!
---
You're in the same situation I'm in. Love the tanking warrior, 0 interest in dps war, and enjoy healing in raids. Strongly leaning towards druid/paladin. Either of them is a nice change of pace from all the time spent tanking as a warrior, and 5man tanks will be in such demand that getting groups should be doable. Heck tanking ZG/AQ20 might even be within reach. Bonus to the paladin, their MC and BWL gear is actually a great tanking set for them.
---
When I ask others why they call it VC. They reply with "Last boss" but technically Cookie is the last boss. The majority of groups kill Cookie after Van by jumping off the upper side of the boat to the lower deck.
---
GL getting a decent tank to do strat living without giving him orbs
---
I didn’t say there is no difference.  I said there is no normal.
---
For alliance I feel like the only answer is Dwarf because of Fear Ward.
---
You dont need to know how to fly a helicopter to know it shouldn't be stuck in a tree.
---
Good point. I considered off-tanking on a Warrior, never thought much about how you'd need to get geared on other classes to be near the same level a Warrior tank is.
---
I guess being a Prot Warrior it would be easier to form Pug groups for easier encounters if I can't commit to a guilds raid times.
---
Yes this is true, but some people don't hold any true allegiance to a faction and just want to play something. I'm definitely more for the horde than I am for the alliance, but with classic I'm kind of torn to be honest.
---
Allied races have nothing in common with end game mechanics.
---
Allied races are "miles out of reach" because a new player would have to: 1. level a character to 120 2. instead of actually playing any content and enjoying that character, go farm a bunch of completely irrelevant content for 3-4 weeks 3. Finally unlock your allied race 4. roll a new character 5. level that character all the way up to 120. 
---
Someone who buys WoW and says, man, dark iron dwarves are fucking cool, I HAVE to play that!! are a minimum of probably 50-60 hours away from even being able to roll that dark iron dwarf and begin levelling it. Allied races are a TERRIBLY clunky system for new players to try to wrap their head around. It isn't a big deal if you played through Legion and were actively playing BFA, but if the character you WANT to play is a Highmountain tauren and you are a new player, that is indeed "miles away."
---
I get your point but you have missed some of mine. The quality of the connections due to hardware used is much better than it was 15 years ago. Right now when I'm pinging anything I'm surprised by seeing even 1 packet loss while back in the day losing 1 every 10 was just your usual business.
---
Another thing that's changed is the sheer number of connections. There's simply more routes a packet can take to find the target because there's both more providers and literal more cables. You used to feel when for example all people in your local (not necessarily LAN tho) network were online because the connection was crowded and packets were literally waiting to finally be routed, causing an artificial lag - that's not an issue anymore.
---
Play icewind dale, baldurs gate 1 and 2, and mordhau lol
---
&gt;And if my time is worth 50-100 gold per hour, so is their time.
---
That's not how it works. Gold has a value of its own as well. It's not entirely decided by how much gold is being farmed in total. Gold is also decided by things like the cost of mounts, repair bills and whatever gold sinks there are in the game.
---
Regardless of anything, I believe that the much greater influx of gold isn't healthy for the game, as it makes it significantly easier to overcome gold sinks. The lack of proper gold sinks was a big problem in late TBC/WotLK/Cata for one. They added stuff like the mammoth mount purely in an attempt to drain the economy of gold a little. It's important that there are gold sinks and that they are scaled to the income of the players. DM farming surely skews that balance a great deal, especially because unlike farming spots out in the world there is no cap on the amount of players that can do so simultaneously.
---
Being able to utilize one of the druid's advantages (mobility &amp; getting away), to then drink is key for almost all PVP.
---
Being able to shadowmeld while drinking to get more mana won me more PVP battles and arena battles than warstomp ever would have.
---
The loot style can be changed at any time, including 5 seconds before the boss is killed.
---
Regardless of peoples knowledge regarding itemization there is a massive influx of freshly rolled players blazing through content all at once. This encourages a saturation of items , some of which will later become quite valuable (twink items/pets/ect)
---
I'm mostly looking to see how long people generally hold on to these sort of items for. I'm assuming it's 2-3 months
---
But you'll also have the best gold making class in the game
---
Yes please pick up fishing, it's such a good money if you know what to fish up. 
---
For example stonescale is needed for alchemists for the oil. Which is used a vast varied of pots 
---
Have fun.
---
Nope. Not at all. Pretty timely queues. New hero is great. Not super broken.
---
normal =/= normalize
---
Are you kidding? if population stays steady for a year and blizzard starts debating to add servers to remove layering on existing servers I will be the first to sign up
---
Yea I'm not trying to disagree with you.  Users ping is much lower now than it was in BC, no arguing that.
---
I was just trying to comment on the fact that it's not due to everyone having more bandwith now, it's due to the cloud hosted servers all around the world that blizzard now leverages.
---
I miss snowball porting places. If someone snowballed you and knocked you down right as you got on, it would dismount you at your destination. Saved a lot of time
---
Watch this video, I made a time stamp at the right spot but you should watch the entire thing
---
https://youtu.be/J-9cich-psI?t=585
---
The only counter argument I have to blowing everything on the epic mount, is high impact crafts let armor for raids. Making sure to have stuff set aside for that.
---
Although you can easily say that the epic mount will benefit in more efficient gold earning because of the increased speed.
---
Just food for thought.
---
There are a few different loot systems in the game.
---
Group Loot, is the default. Any item that meets the minimum quality selected (Green is the default) appears in a loot window. With the option of Needing, Greeding or Passing. Most pickup groups use this system its pretty much the standard.
---
Free for All, does what it says on the tin, No rolls. First come first serve.
---
Masterloot, the Leader of the party/raid is default set as the loot master, they can assign it to another person. The lootmaster can assign items dropped to any present members of the group/raid. No one else can touch the non-quest item loot.
---
Need before Greed, required you to be able to use it to hit the Need button. This is a bit shakey however, as its not like the modern system retail uses. The stipulation is "can equip the item" which mean warriors can effectively need everything but wands, while a priest could only roll on cloth, 1h maces, wands, staves and daggers for example. No one uses this system, it was pretty flawed in Vanilla.
---
Round Robin, each mob killed that had loot belongs to one member of the group, it cycles through each member, only exception is BoP items. Which standard Group Loot applies to. No one uses this much either.
---
In classic you could 5-8 kite warriors for restealths.  This will no longer be possible.
---
I would just hope that if they decide to replay some expansions they strive to limit the class changes to keep game play as close to vanilla as possible; not withstanding some class balance. 
---
part of each expansions problem was their attempt to rework gameplay too much
---
What's in retail is personal loot. meaning there is no rolling on items. You either get loot or not. In classic You actually have to click a button to roll. Either Need, greed or pass, for the lootsystem need or greed.
---
Masterlooter is the loot system when the leader of the group/raid chooses which items go to which player.
---
Yeah especially phase 3 when everything rezzes. I had a good PC and I still went down to like 4 FPS.
---
If you are fighting other druids in the world you have broken the  druid code man.
---
It would probably just make you look silly. He's right, and this launch is not going to be like any other before it. There's going to be a relatively well-informed minority coming from private servers that are thrown into an ocean of retail players, people coming back for nostalgia, etc. Additionally, while server population will probably be similar to private servers, there will be several fold more of some materials available than on a private server; herbs, ore, etc. availability will be multiplied by as many layers as exist on the server. This may even extend to resources like devilsaur hides and black lotus. So not only has a launch like this never happened before, ever, but we don't have nearly enough information about the game systems yet to extrapolate current knowledge into any reasonable guesses of what a Classic server economy could look like. Regardless of whatever you think you know, I promise you are wrong.
---
Alliance: Dwarf. No discussion.
---
Horde: either is fine, Trolls look better though.
---
Honestly, I'd say Dwarf regardless of faction.
---
Troll is my preference on Horde for Shadowguard Blackoit procs.Trolls are also the min/max caster race for PvE
---
Anyone got a paladin guide ? It's hard finding one that's indepth normally starts with go holy get in a group and cry for a while
---
You mean spend 10minutes of my precious playtime, doing nothing, in order for everyone to have a better system that won't be abused to hell? HOW DARE YOU SIR! /s
---
I am so fucking hyped! I don't think I've ever been this hyped over a game in my life!
---
You mean Anal Rodeo.
---
Wait, if it's triggered by XP, how does it prevent from switching layers to farm new nodes / herbs? Picking those doesn't give any XP
---
Professor Ratigan?
---
Isn't 2h fury the best because of sit enrage on private servers
---
Meanwhile my guild didn't even have a dwarf priest so we all had to learn to stance dance. When we did finally get a one, it was kind of whatever since we didn't really need it.
---
Thanks for the reply will absolutely have a look!
---
Meanwhile people on this sub keep saying the average playtime to 60 will be under 10 days for sure, ive even seen someone suggest average playtime to 60 being less than 6 days lmao  
---
10 days at 40 was quite normal in my experience, I remember my friend had 25 days played when he dinged 40 for the first time xd
---
Firstly, hopefully layering isn’t still in the game after a year. Secondly I personally won’t reroll after a year of progress and I imagine many people will feel the same way.
---
The door is that way ——-&gt; 
---
But in all honesty, any “small player base” that includes people like you....is already toxic.
---
There is no personal loot, if that's where the confusion is coming from.
---
It triggers when you gain xp, and in addition to that it also triggers when you farm nodes, pvp, loot chests, etc.
---
Alliance is typically considered to have the PvE advantage due to having paladins. They are just so strong individually and the blessings are amazing. 
---
Warrior plus any Healer is going to be a very strong combination. Druids, paladins, shamans, and priests compliment them well and each provide different utility. I would give the edge to paladins/shamans due to blessings and wind fury. 
---
You cant go wrong with an Orc/tauren warrior for horde. Orcs get stun resist and axe expertise, so if you get a good 1 handed axe to tank with, you gain the same advantage as the human. Tauren get the bonus health, which will be worth a few hundred health if you AQ/Naxx gear. Warstomp can also be very useful in a bunch of scenarios. 
---
Undead priest gets will of the forsaken, but trolls get berzerking. Each has their uses. Cant go wrong with either. 
---
Engineering is great for tanks, the bombs can help with AoE threat and crowd control. Blacksmithing can be beneficial for crafting resist gear or the nightfall axe. You'd probably want to pair either of those with mining. 
---
Alchemy / enchanting are great options for either of you if you dont want to go down the engineering route. Enchanting isnt hard to level if you have two characters feeding items to one person for disenchantment. 
---
Priests aren't really boxed into a profession. None of them give significant PvE advantages as far as I'm aware. Maybe tailoring for an item or two, but raiding will replace those items at some point. 
---
Just don't double up on a crafting profession and make sure to take a gathering profession that synergize with whatever else you chose.
---
Dude, stop.
---
You've assumed that these players have brains...
---
It was really that bad. But again, remember, we all had higher pings, we were using mice with lower DPI, we were gaming at much lower resolutions, with much lower framerates and no smooth GSync or AdaptSync. Heck many of us weren't even using mechanical or high quality keyboards either.
---
Soooo much has gotten better, that what felt smooth 15 years ago, feels choppy today when you add up all those differences.
---
Good write up.  The size of taurens make it tough to navigate some indoor areas.  I also think a good leveling partner for a druid is a warlock.  A good idea as a druid healer is to make sure your group has a paladin or shaman to have a true resurrection spell on the team to save gy runs.
---
An uninformed promise means nothing to me. I know what I know lol
---
to have 11 days played without being fully geared at cap would be noob af for a whole 3 or 4 expansions ahahaha.. but yea i was the same back then, just chillin hard and levelling new toons
---
Congratulations on your new home!
---
i don't know why, but that flub he had when saying that line has always bothered me.
---
"i bu-but i understand"
---
I guess it was because it was going to be such an epic line and he flubadubbed it
---
yes the feedback you have been bitching about people giving, god you're an idiot
---
&gt; Now that their business model continues to shift towards microtransactions and the 'theme park' style of content progression that people burn through quickly they see it as less parasitic and more supplementary. 
---
This is important to highlight. WoW Classic was a hard sell because a huge revenue generating component would be absent; microtransactions. When compared, Microtransaction revenue dwarfs subscription revenue.
---
Remove layering and we'll stop complaining. The issue is not the complaining. Stop trying to silence the people whose voices got us this far.
---
Jokerd on YouTube has a video of 1 hour 19 min run 1-10 as gnome mage. Not quite one hour but pretty damn good.
---
1.5s, of course.
---
DAE hate people who get angry at exploits?!
---
True too. Also, most of the classes aren't lore-heavy in the first place. Anyone arcane-minded can be a mage; anyone without hooves can be a rogue; anyone can be a warrior.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't change the loot system during combat.
---
There was some stuff missing, but WoW released with undeniably over 300 hours of content, a world so large it was practically incomprehensible at the time, and Blizzard started turning out major content patches so quickly that most people weren't even close to having been caught up by the time new stuff was added. 
---
It took me personally over 500 hours on a single character to hit 60 and probably close to 1,000 in-game hours total across all the alts I tried out before finally pushing something to 60 - and I'm fairly confident that was the experience of most of the playerbase.
---
WoW was always intended to be a living, breathing world. Just because Blizz was still working on some aspects of that doens't mean WoW wasn't one of the most "complete" games ever released.
---
Theres more than one trigger.
---
My brother wanted me to play a mage when we started because it would fill out our 5-man dungeon-leveling group well.  But I never really enjoyed mage-I secretly started leveling a hunter one day when he wasn't online, and one day I log in with my 60 hunter and tell his warrior who it is.  
---
In a later expansion, I eventually level-capped a mage, but I never got the rush from a mage that I had playing hunter.
---
I just hope the servers can handle it, I booked a week off of work..
---
Tauren Druid have 2 more spirit than Night Elves.
---
If TBC servers come out AND you gear a resto druid like I do, this will be very important.
---
It’s not much help and probably only makes it harder but i believe warlock and paladin mounts aren’t “free”. You’re still gonna be saving for the quest item requirements and I don’t think they’re super cheap. Cheaper but not free.
---
I feel like the giant hitbox they have paired with the fact that druids never melee out of form, would make tauren a lot worse than on PS
---
Damn, better than Martin's
---
I actually got ahead of the crush of people in the stress test because I lucked out and made my character on server 15 right off the bat, which was the only PvP server that said high pop when the stress test started.  Wasn't bad at all before the first disconnect while they shut down the other servers and forced a bunch of people over to 15.  By the time the starting zones were able absolute mess, I was already out and into Mulgore.  By the time Mulgore was getting bad, I was in the Barrens.
---
At that point a friend had logged in and I made a new Tauren with him, and it took us like 2 hours just to finish Camp Narache, it was so damn packed, by 2 hours on my first Tauren I was going on level 12 and about to leave Mulgore.
---
I'm just hoping that come launch day, I can get right online and get going to break out ahead of the pack like I did on the stress test server.  If that doesn't happen, then I fully expect it to take 6+ hours just to hit 10 or so.  It's also going to heavily depend on how they shard/layer the starting zones, anyone could luck out and have an area seemingly to themselves and just blast ahead of everyone.
---
Did you post this asking for an opinion and then shoot down the top rated opinion that was given? Oof.
---
Any ubrs lbrs / mc wipe on Horde side.  
---
The run took to long....
---
The 12 year old me looked at my FEMALE ORC  then called it Uglaa caus it looked ugly . .. then found out that Uglaa means owl in swedish I think
---
I miss me some moonwalking.  Especially when you get the moonwalk killing blow on somebody.
---
The issue isn't what you know. It's all of the things you and everyone else outside of Blizzard don't know. My promise is informed by the one piece of knowledge we do have: that we don't know enough.
---
haha I mean what if the CD is two hours for example? I'm a patient guy, don't worry 'bout me, but it might complicate a lot of other things !
---
Was there a GY in silithus for the entirety of classic?  I am curious if silithus used the ungoro GY for a few weeks.
---
I'm going TD. I love their starting location, gentle natures (which I somewhat project on them) and attunement to the magic of the natural world. The night elves are awesome too, but there's something about RPing as a tauren that I personally find very satisfying.
---
Of course. I also look forward to new guilds though.
---
The outcry is what brought this change. Constructive criticism is import. And most of it was indeed constructive - we came up with many different solutions, internal CD being one of them. Albeit, it might not be as elegant, as having it limited to &lt;20 lvl zones, it still works
---
&gt; Oh who am I kidding, they're still gonna whine.
---
I think people will complain about layering in the past even after its removed in phase 2. I have a small bet going with a friend.
---
Dwarf female is the only answer. Any other suggestions are simply wrong :)
---
Oilies for FAP always, rumsey Black label, nightfin (although sagefish looks like available at launch). And firefin since AQ (before for lower fire protection pot if elemental fire is limited)
---
I plan to play as a Tauren Shaman but will that hurt my chances trying to raid? I definitely don't mind having to tank or heal. Trying to do things right this go around. Thank you in advance and may Earth Mother bless you.
---
I think people generally agree that something needs to be changed about it. If it is coded the same way as it was in 2004, better internet/servers/computers are making it play differently.
---
Fear ward and stone form are very strong racials
---
I know people say post naxx meaning when all content is out and not implicitly higher than naxx, but I hope the majority is "pre" naxx in so far as stuff like this rep grind, more zones for levelling/pre raid content and new pre 60 dungeons, more class quests etc. That's just as good, if not better to me than a higher raid tier.
---
The 40 mounts are a quest turn in a single Q, the epic mount for paladin is 6 arcanite bars , 40 runecloth , strathlome water and about 600g ( and something else but I can't remember what)
---
When I boss is killed in vanilla it drops a few items that are shared among all party members.  In 5-mans you can just roll need or greed on it.  On 40man raids, things get a lot more interesting.  You can earn/spend DKP or guild officers may give it out based on benfit to the guild.
---
Yeah, they have good internet too.  Well, at least compared to me, I live in out in the boonies and have 15/1 DSL, they live in town and have 120/30 cable.
---
I guess then I could start streaming from the basement and maybe make enough money for hot pockets and mountain dew.
---
Class leader, now that’s something I haven’t heard for a long long time haha. Good read. I too was a dwarf priest, loved the feeling of being that important ;)
---
Yeah imma need originals/authors of... all of these
---

---
I do still take Cruelty, after getting deep wounds and impale for the synergy. 
---
What "improved rage generation"? Unbridled Wrath? That's a 40% chance to generate a single rage point for 5 talent points. That's awful until endgame dual wielding.
---
By contrast, Arms gets Improved Charge and Anger Management for additional rage generation.
---
Arms also gives you Deflection, which I think is an undervalued talent for reducing damage, increasing dps (because parry reduces your swing timer), and reducing downtime. Also great for tanking early dungeons.
---
Shadow PVE ONLY 
---
Human is slightly stronger for DPS since plus spell damage gear has some spirit 
---
But Dwarf fear ward is very good on few fights.
---
You are not going to use Devouring Plague since it is too much mana for the DPS it provides so Troll berserk is slightly better
---
For PVP 
---
Undead and Dwarf hands down. I believe Dwarf's stoneskin is the strongest racial in the game to the point that Blizz eventually nerfed it.
---
I never loved SW but I will miss IF, UC kinda scratches that itch of "underground" city though.
---
Sure, there is absolutely no way they were aware of the potential issues of a system they designed and had been working on them during the stress tests that were implemented for this very reason.
---
The actual date that it became a raiding guild was  Sep 22, 05. This is when the players from Royal Council  came together with the players of Deus Vox. Prior to that they were raiding in joint raids with other guilds. This was when they started on the journey to pass every other guild.
---
On a related subject.  In early levels don't get firebolt rank 2 right away.  All it does it oom your imp for less damage overall.
---
Unless your guild is some cutting edge world or server first guild you should be fine. Raid times should only be 2-3 times a week. Also people know how to prepare for the raids now a days, and the bosses mechanics are widely known at least for MC, BWL Onyxia and Naxx. 
---
I don’t think it will be as time consuming as it was back in the day.
---
Actually, if they're not *actively* defending their trademark, there's way more legal room for others to infringe upon it, as the link is seen as weakened.
---
 C. Justified by population to have lively servers  
---
I think this is the only consideration they have.  I am speaking from the outside looking in.  The goal they want to meet is have servers where players are populated after a year of playing classic wow.  To me their announcement of things like no RP PVP servers, no language servers for Europe, are all moves to eliminate server mergers that fuck up names, guilds, and worst of all economies.  They also want a populated world without sharding different servers together to make the world feel populated.
---
I thought that was mage.
---
So I main a warrior and have been leveling one in the beta now testing everything out. 
---
1) Hamstring kiting - This is still extremely viable if you have a swing timer. With the mob leeway and spell batching, and different movement from pservers that most are use to it is a bit of a learning curve. You have to figure out hit boxes, timing, and how to use your camera angles to actually be facing your target when you run back in. 
---
2) Specs - I personally go full arms until 40. I don't bother with getting the 5% crit. For a couple reasons. The first being that at 30 sweeping strikes is worth WAY more to you than 5% crit. The second being I want to keep my respecs at a minimum and don't want to waste my low costing respec at 30 and then another one at 40. Saves money for mounts. 
---
Also 2H fury will NOT work the way people use it on private servers because the /sit macro DOES NOT work. Again going back to my full arms build until 40 because 5% crit isn't going to make your life a TON easier. 
---
Bottom line - Arms is the cost effective way to go. You may knock out a LITTLE leveling time from 10-20 with the 5% crit in fury but its not worth wasting a low cost respec. After 20 that 5% crit is still awesome, but it wont make that much of a difference.
---
Hopefully this clears some things up for you. On my phone typing this up at lunch lol.
---
At some point today I will edit this post of mine because I should talk more about PvP and the differences between paladin and shaman for druids. As well as more faction specific things, such as warlocks. Horde (generally) have more warlocks than alliance do, and warlocks are a pretty hard counter to druids, so that is something to note for PvP.
---
There is certain spec builds that you can go but from 1-35ish is horrible , still going to do it though, I had a spec for  it , will link it in a sec when I find it
---
the anger comes from undead rogues ganking in darkshire
---
If it's 2 hours, that could put a huge damper on grouping for dungeons.
---
&gt; It triggers when you gain xp. People gain xp so regularly that it will almost always be triggered.
---
The way I understood it was like this --
---
Let's say it's a 2 minute CD just for the sake of discussion.  If you haven't changed layers in a while, you are free to do so.  So a friend invites you, and boom -- new layer, and the 2 min CD begins.  Within that 2 minutes, every time you gain XP, it resets back up to 2 minutes.  BUT, if you sit AFK for 2 minutes and let the cooldown finish, subsequent procs of XP or gathering nodes do not incur a "new" 2 minute CD.
---
I'm looking for being #1 every single game, not once in a while.
---
Fine, I'll bite. The first week classic releases will see nearly all the concurrent players subscribed running through low level dungeons. These players will see MASSIVE amounts of BoE drops including Twink items/pets/ect. Players at this point will have almost no gold so these items will sell on the AH for pennies. Holding on to items such as this for a month or two will see their prices skyrocket as the saturation will become less and less with fewer people running the dungeons, more people with more gold accrued, and more of a necessity for twink items. These trends will not change depending on whatever make believe variables you feel are going to surface in classic. Please elaborate on how this trend will not happen? It's not a matter of a new version and new mechanics, it's fundamental economics.
---
Agreed. Layering is horrible even if it was a hundred percent exploit proof and there was only 1 Lord Kazzak etc.
---
That was the plan until a bunch of cryhards made a fuss about spell batching
---
Be nice. He just asked a question. /s

Eh, having the clearly defined role of pocket-healer is not gimped in any way at all unless she wants to DPS, in which case she should. Any new and casual player is going to be doing sub-par DPS; if anything, that might feel more "gimped" in her experience by doing that than by giving her a role where she won't be forced into that comparison.

hit num lock and come back 5 minutes later only to find your character running into a table in the middle of a field 10 yards away from where you started.
---
Bruh if you're gonna have 50% of the old gang back you are miles ahead of most of us. I'm facebook friends with like 3 people from WoW still but I doubt any of them still associate my random ass facebook profile with our gamin days 15 years ago :(

On private servers I learned that gray quests only gave a token amount of exp
---
Jeez it's actually disgusting how I have thought about playing it everyday for 600 days
---
The feedback was okay the first 10 - 20 times. Now it's getting silly.
---
I took a glance at the official classic forums for En/DE/Fr and learnt some interestingt things:
---
* The EN Sticky Thread for the server Structure has about 3.8k posts as of now is quite alive with posts every few minutes.
---
* The FR sticky (correct me if I am wrong about the following) currently only has a little bit over 1k posts but it had nearly 4k two days ago. A little bit of research leads me to believe that the french blues closed the thread because reasons and reopened it. So we don't have a definitive number of feedback.
---
* The DE sticky thread for the EU realmstructure is at 16.6k posts and rising. The german blue cm Toschayju seems quite helpful in gathering feedback and sending it to the respective people.
---
As of now, german resposnes alone would warrant DE/FR servers. Keep up the good fight, I say!
---
You can if you’re a madman
---
What do you mean bringing tk our atrention, this shit has been reposted since it was announced.
---
If you're a miner or herber, the mount drastically increases your income. Also on pvp servers epic mounts are a bit of an arms race. If you're the last to get an epic, prepare to get run down a whole lot.
---
Well the Night Elf may not be bad. On the stress test I played a human.
---
That's why i'm saying it's ok for the first few weeks, if after 2 weeks the servers are completly full it probably means that we need at least one or two more servers. Since most people are going to leave in the two first weeks anyway i think. 
---
And why it would disrupt communities if the server merges ? Communities will still be there if they only merges 2 servers at a time ? idk
---
Definitely earned it with that top damage done!
---
Yup
---
Sham = heal in raids. Doesnt matter which race.
---
Lol what
---
That's better than most us.  I know about 3 people from back in the day and we're starting from scratch otherwise.
---
I think we'll see additional servers come out after the initial release based on population.
---
I got banned for quoting Billy Madison

Considering you lose the talent when you respec, you probably need to retrain from Enh to Enh again.

Destiny 2. It is a very different game but at heart still a loot chaser. It also rewards you for having good reflexes and game awareness. It also (hopefully) has a badass expansion set for September.
---
Truly the worst feeling to be on the other end. Ret Pally in our Naxx raid rolled an 8 on Demise, I lol’d as he raged and eventually congratulated me - then I rolled... a 7. I was dumbfounded.
---
how will leeway effect hunters?
---
So we're excusing the illegalities because Gil is funny munny?

Thanks for the info, as someone who’s never played a warrior in classic before this is very helpful!

Oh wow thanks for the information, i'll be doing a lock gnome too and planned to go for darkshore. Thanks

It was different back than, Dungeon bosses usually dropped 1 item that needed to be shared by 5 players while raid bosses usually dropped around 3 items that had to be shared by 40 players.
---
and it could happen that only hunter items dropped while you had no hunter in the raid or group. 
---
There was no personal loot, so don't be thinking you get your tier 1 in a month, it can take a very long time to complete a set let alone get your bis items, but this isn't a bad thing, cause you were happy excited for other guild members getting their bis/sets as well and when you get loot yourself it felt so rewarding.
---
If you already know what's right and wrong then why did you even ask the question?
---
Shockadin was a thing in TBC. Not that much + sp in Classic to support it early. Especially while levelling.
---
I played when I was younger and don't remember the patch number.  When did the MP5 stop being good?
---
If you only level and do if efficiently, why not. But I am goin to PvP, run dungs, do profs, all class quests and chill with my friends while level occasionaly.
---
Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark

If you loved Final Fantasy Tactics this game is pretty much a clone of it with like 40 or so classes.

Yeah, getting rep with timbermaw so I could go through without being attacked is the only rep I specifically remember grinding, besides waterlords to do MC.
---
Sweet, thank you bro

I want to play outsider class, that's why I will propably make a druid or paladin. Warrior also interest me as the tank role interest me

I imagine it is a pretty minor cooldown. I'd also venture a guess that you get an error message when trying to party up with people that says how long the cooldown is and why you can't switch. Blizz may not be great at everything but I don't think they've ever done something as bone-headed as implement a mechanic that prevents you from partying up without providing any sort of explanation, notice, or error message about WHY.
---
As Horde, that cave isn't bad at all :) There's a quest (Test of Lore) that takes you down to the bottom, but most of the mobs inside are neutral.
---
You'll also probably be a high enough level by the time you get there that even the hostile mobs are only slightly annoying.
---
The barrows in NE Stonetalon, on the other hand, are a huge pain.
---
Melee (and ranged) attacks have an animation.  The "swing" for melee and the "pull your arrow and shoot" for ranged.  It's not a true "cast time" in the traditional sense because there is no cast bar, but you can treat them a cast time.
---
This is why you're auto swing can be off cooldow, but if you walk up to a mob and right click, the damage doesn't happen IMMEDIATELY when you right click, the character has to go through the swing (or shoot) animation - that is the cast time.  And that is the time of window someone can go from max range, to out of range.
---
That's exactly the reason. Without on-demand enrage, 2h fury will be kinda "meh" for leveling.
---
For me it's not that we might have a few people on a server I can't talk to. It's the fact that I might get to 40 or 50 before realising I'm on the unofficial french server or something. A lot of people know English but I sure as hell don't know a luck if french or German.
---
If we can figure out which server is going to be flooded with nonenglish speakers before launch that would be ideal. But do we even know what the realms will be called before launch?
---
600g more like 300-400g. Its closer to 600g if you buy all those mats needed.
---
Ahh good points, for some reason I thought anger management was fury. 
---
The ones like Enrage &amp; Imp Shout still look slightly better to me than getting impale &amp; overpower crit boost, though.
---
hello Jonatron, im the GM of azoic and we're going to be a 2 day raiding guild that's aiming to be a top tier 2 day raiding guild with a core of players with top 25 world retail experience, we're in need of both a prot warr and healers atm so none of you will have to change specs. you can add me on discord if you find this interesting: Daniel/shrum#8973
---
I mean, you can only complete the quests once. There's nothing stopping you from enjoying Jintha'alor and climbing the ruins for fun and profit (wildviiiiiine).
---
Who wants to bet at least one of these dudes who said “FOR THE HORDE” has a horde tattoo and neck beard?? Too much real life
---
First, I don't understand the relevance of what you said in relation to what you quoted. But also, you do lose dps (though Tirus never said you did) because you're being hit less you generate less rage.
---
Not a bad idea. Sword spec can lead to extra attacks and improved overpower can give you a fairly consistent instant attack until you hit 40 and can get your 31 point talent. At 40 I'd probably just go back to 2 handers though since MS does beast mode damage.
---
Yeah I know , I wouldn't level as shockadain like you said lack of Sp at low levels is just not worth it till very late phase 5 or 6 ? Pretty much the end of vanilla. It's VERY gear dependent
---
I'm happy to heal till then 😊
---
You seem annoying
---
The dev/mods on vanilla forums were easily triggered and waved their ban hammers around quickly lol funny most of them have been fired now xD
---
Remember in the beginning blizz claimed that they did a subscription so they didn't have to continue with expansion like content. The subs paid for future content. When TBC was announced I knew right away this was the first step towards a slippery slope that ended up being BFA. 
---
I loved the shit out of TBC and a lot of the core balancing for classes but a lot of that content (hyjal, kara, etc) was already in vanilla and just needed to be released. Instead they refined it and waited to paywall it via full price expansion.
---
I'm with the epic mount crowd. The quicker you can get it you are just that much more ahead of everyone else who are still using 60% mounts.
---
Having your epic mount significantly increases your earning potential while farming and overall increases the amount of mats you are actually able to farm during a session.
---
Personally I'm still undecided on what professions I will be rolling with. A lot of people will be going herb/skinning and this leads me to believe the market will be flooded. 
---
I'm leaning towards herb/mining. Simply because both BS and Eng need the mats from mining. So if the herb market is flooded I can sit on the mats until demand picks up while selling what I get from mining. 
---
I also feel many people won't go herb/mining because they don't want to keep switching to track herb/mine. When in reality a single macro makes toggling between the two a non-issue.
---
Sadly won't happen. They still believe retail is the future and would rather just have a couple dudes make BC for a few extra side dollars.
---
Yeah, is better to be thinking about this shit every time i need a party, than be fighting for mobs the first 6 levels, like in vanilla.
---
Vanilla was a success, even with these "super problems" the first 24h of the game.
---
I don't want layers, ty.
---
Toppin charts increases your /roll rng. Proven

---
Did you even read the title of the thread?
---
True , yeah I'm just thinking 600g , give myself something to aim for , for the mats I'm going alchemy anyway
---
Enh will be welcome in melee groups among casual guilds but you still might face some stigma in 40 and 5-mans. You can go Ele-Resto though and still do a good job raid healing in PVE while owning in PVP. Warrior is not easy to play with the level of domination that is becoming expected of them. A lot of work is being put into min-maxing rotations and especially gear. I would honestly recommend hunter then at this point.
---
Delete this
---
Me and bro want to duo level and play. What do you think about warrior druid combo? I saw in Kargoz's video, it's not a tier 1 levelling spec. I think it wasn't even tier 2. 
---
Alternatively, what about double druid? Or would the gear overlap suck?
---
You don't happen to be from Canada and have the same nickname in GTA 5 Online, would you? I had a friend there with the same name.
---
Ahh, you might be right. Can't really remember.
---
Seriously? Are we thinking about super complex systems just to avoid tag fights for the first 24h???
---
" i know what i know lol"
---
Did you literally dedicate an entire post to show of your arrogance ? If so its working .
---
All your comments are /r/iamverysmart
---
I hope it gets delayed 6 days
---
I agree w this comment
---
I'd venture a guess that a work around would be for you to leave group 1, and just invite everyone from group 2, assuming they haven't done too much shifting. 
---
The way the system is described there really shouldn't be more than 4-5 layers kinda ever anyways, and likely only in the first few weeks before less layers become necessary. Odds are that when classic goes live, you'll find it more likely to find yourself on the same layer as someone than on the stress tests with 30K people
---
Overpower crit is an incredible talent. Easily one of the best point for point talents you’ll get.
---
Precisely, by many little posts, I'd rather have a big one that gets enough traction for blizz to notice it well and read all the arguments, you know?
---
Your right.
---
Don't worry about it , I've been checking this shit continuously for the last few months
---
Sorry mate, I cant say that is me.  Never played GTA5!
---
No idea :/ I added this concern about unofficial servers in the post tho
---
Heh...yeah...that IS odd.
---
How will leeway effect hunters? 50 yards range now? And what about deadzone
---
He's not solo, a guy not grouped is killing mobs he tagged.

&gt;Stack Spirit early on, even it it means wearing cloth. You can regen 3-4% of your health per tick between mobs, though I think I've heard that HP regen may work differently in Classic. 
---
bro. wut. are these tips based off how things are in private servers? never bother with spirit as a warrior. i would avoid cloth too. at most, i would take 1 piece of leather for crit or hit. generally, the mail (and later plate) gear you get in dungeons used to suit warriors for leveling just fine. prioritizing sta and str  with agi/crit/hit where you can get it. just have first aid up to bandage. some food, worst case. downtime gets better as you gear up.
---
DW fury leveling is what i'm going to be doing. that was the way to go in vanilla. unless they've done a lot of changes to the mechanics, i'm gonna stick to that. something similar to this  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVV0VMxRVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVV0VMxRVo) . tapping into imp. zerker rage etc. as i go beyond 40. purely focused on killing fast. no PvP in mind. i'll probably switch to arms at 40 if i feel more inclined to PvP, however.
---
my strategy for killing mobs was to just focus on 1 mob at a time. charge-&gt;battle shout (if it's not up)-&gt;instant attacks (ww, blood thirst)-&gt;heroic strike if i can afford to-&gt;execute. maybe throw in a rend if rage gen is good. demoralizing shout and thunderclap if it's a hard hitting mob, maybe.
---
one of the biggest challenges leveling a warrior in vanilla was rage generation. they addressed that in later patches but it was still a nuisance if you were not geared up yet. whatever little rage you get early on should be spent on doing damage. it also kinda sucks before you have instant attacks like WW or blood thirst because using a heroic strike meant that you missed out on rage from an auto attack.
---
I find humans boring. I like the short and stout aesthetic of Dwarves, and the accent and culture.
---
It's definitely good, but the consistent 25% attack power bonus from Imp Shout seems better while leveling than 50% extra crit on one skill that can't be used unless the enemy dodges to me.
---
Monster hunter
---
I would go rogue. If you guys level together there shouldn't be any issues with leveling speed. Since you said wpvp would be main focus a rogue pairs very nicely with a hunter for ganking and fending off ganks. Having the hunter open and then you stun locking should make quick work and you'll be able to help peel for him. Plus the counter gank for when you inevitably draw enough attention to start a real fight.

You're all wrong, technically.
---
On Horde side, if you die in the Deeprun Tram right next to the portal to Ironforge, your ghost will be in the Lumbermill on the very far east of Elwynn Forest. You'll have to run across the entirety of Elwynn, weave your way through Stormwind, and then wait for the tram to transport your spectral ass to the Ironforge side.
---
If you discount the tram picking you up, then *technically* this is the longest corpse run, if you account actually running through the tram tunnel.
---
&gt; I would say that for me, it's a combination of the above. First of all, for me, the modification of the tone of the work feels wrong. 
---
If the modification of the tone felt "right", would that change your opinion? I may be misunderstanding what you meant by that though. Correct me if that's the case.
---
&gt;The artist had a vision, likely spent a good long while hashing it out, and put out a beautiful piece. If you think about it, technically it is already his take on another artists work ( the graphical artist that created the Ironforge city in Warcraft, though this is a full impressionistic take as much as looking at a real life location would be).
---
I think we both agree that this piece, while heavily inspired by the in-game depiction and other concept art, would be considered an original piece. But something I hadn't considered until now is about artists capturing another's art in a different form, like a photographer photographing architecture. Would that be "creating" or "modifying"?
---
&gt; I personally do not believe people should modify art.
---
That's interesting. Do you consider video games art? If so, how do you feel about mods in video games? 
---
What about colouring/recolouring of old photographs?
---
And, do you also feel this way towards parodies? Or fan re-cuts of movies? What about song mashups and remixes?
---
&gt;Should another graffiti artist stroll up to a banksy piece out in the wild and toss something else on it to change it up?
---
That would destroy the original. Which would be 100% unacceptable. The amazing thing about digital works is the non-destructive nature of modifying. You can slice, dice, distort, and mangle a copy to your heart's content without ever doing damage to the original.
---
Dwarf, troll
---
To be bored again in 30 days! Woot
---
It's a fine plan and definitely safe, but also a very well known one (it's featured in the gold guide that's currently on the front page of this sub, complete with a list of what items to look for). As the other guy said though, time value of money is a real thing here. Selling to twinks is playing the very long game, and inflation will eat up a significant part of your profits.
---
being aware of potential issues ≠ acting up on them
---
Which is indeed a good point, but will fuck up tremendously the rest. Sure it's cool to have a lot of people, but if it means dealing with 5 different languages, it's gonna be a mess.
---
Really want to main a Dwarf (class would be Paladin or Priest), but also really would like to tank as a Druid. I'm torn to shreds over it.
---
Thank you! ❤️
---
I've decided what I am going to play.  99% sure I will be a Night Elf Hunter, with a 1% chance of going Orc Hunter (if my friend decides to flop factions right before launch).  However, what I'm having trouble with is pets.  I've narrowed it down to 4 options:
---
1. Get a cat with a 1.4 attack speed from the starter zone, and then get a cat with a 1.2 attack speed from Hillsbrad when I'm in my high 20s or low 30s.  Broken Tooth will come later, as I do not want to waste hours or days of leveling time farming a rare that will bring me from 1.2 to 1.0.
---
2. Get a Carrion Bird out of Westfall around level 16 or 17, and use Carrion Birds to 60.  Bonus because they have higher tanking stats and Screech.
---
3. Get a boar from Elwynn or Westfall for Charge, and then simply keep the boar to 60 (or keep it to 30ish when I can get dash or dive).
---
4. Get a Wind Serpent.  I haven't decided if I want a normal Wind Serpent with a 2.0 attack speed, or if I want to try and get Arikara with a 1.7.  On the one hand, Arikara is an elite spawned by a horde quest, so I will need to gank a group of Horde in order to tame it.  On the other hand, with a ranged pet, the higher damage per hit may be preferred over a faster attack speed.
---
The order I posted them is the order I'm considering, so Cat &gt; Carrion Bird &gt; Boar &gt; Wind Serpent.  But I'm nowhere near a decision yet.
---
Can't decide between sham and warlock.  Leaning warlock, but...
---
I played a priest in retail from vanilla to bfa (skipped a few expansions though).  I like casters, and I dont mind healing.  Ele sham seems strong, warlock seems strong, both for pvp at least, which seems the most fun.  PVE is pretty barebones, warlock spams shadowbolt and resto spams chain heal.  Warlock can probably farm better, and *seems* to have a higher skill cap in PVP which is why I'm mostly leaning that way.  Also I've never raided as a DPS before.
---
Alliance will have less kids than it used to. As most of the Alliance kids are not adults. Other than that, will pretty well be the same as Vanilla I bet.
---
Always go dwarf for the fear ward...
---
Dwarfs have more hp but a tad less damage.  I don't see what NE brings to the table.
---
TBC did not cost $60, it was more like $35 to $40. 
---
Aside from that you are probably right with you assumptions.
---
Servers transfers is the worst possible solution and money grab i've ever seen. If they do that well.. For the money i guess.
---
The AAA industry is bad as usual, but indie games are killing it with stuff like  Katana Zero, My Friend Pedro, Jump King. Great MP games out now too like Mordhau and battalion 44.
---
Except we are on a thread discussing the tweet where they acted on the issue....
---
Came here to say this one. You have to...
---
1. Run across the entirety of Elwynn Forest
---
2. Weave your way through Stormwind to the tram
---
3. Wait for the tram car to come to Stormwind side and pick you up.
---
If you ignore the tram car, then the run-back to your corpse is easily the longest since you have to go down the tram tunnel.
---
Did a lot of World PvP in the Deeprun Tram as Horde so I knew the pain well...
---
Yup true, the odds shouldn't be too bad on a server with 3 layers which is what they were talking about. Hope it all works out !
---
I agree with UbiGeofram's argument.  The predictions the "wowologists" that monitor daily/weekly/monthly numbers for every wow patch, expansion, and all the competitor games have told the director they expect long term population to stabilize at such a number that 5 realms (maybe 15 total for 5 of each version of realm) will make the world feel massively multiplayer.  It is a prediction based on prior events and probably averaging populations from other MMOs including Wow but with a heavier weighting to their own game.  
---
It is totally possible for the game director to let your region hang itself with its own noose and give you guys 40-50 servers.  But in one year, maybe even 3 months, with so many servers there will be an outcry that the game feels like a ghost town.  
---
A  good argument for fewer servers would be to take a look at wow classic beta streamers.  Even 6 weeks into the beta, there are not enough people around to run RFC anymore.  There are some stipulations with the closed beta versus a live service version, but the player drop off for all realms will be just as present if not more drastic on the live service.  Could there not be enough people on your realm to run low level dungeons on the second, third or fourth month of your subscription?  Yes, it is possible if the wow player base is spread out too thin with too many servers.  
---
Do you want to experience content and have generic language servers? Do you want to take control, have the blame at your feet, pay up with your wallet, and forge your entire region's destiny and ensure you can have language specific servers, with a greater chance (Based on the best predictions of the wow team) of not having the ability to experience content?
---
I have better ping to private servers than I had to Vanilla servers that were to my knowledge somewhere in France.
---
Merge servers and put the persons server name in front of their name.
---
Would only have a guess when it comes to faction population balance. I expect on PvE servers alliance will be massively outnumbering horde on most servers. For PvP servers I expect it to be pretty balanced although alliance should still be more popular I would guess.
---
I'm not an EU players, but this really doesn't make sense to me.  I can't imagine the frustration playing with people that don't speak my language.  I've dealt with it before with high Chinese populations in mmo's and it just turned into "Cao ni ma" spam.  I'm being dramatic but you get the point.
---
At a minimum blizz could suggest servers based on language.  For example some servers could be suggested German, or English, or German/English.  I think they're concern is making too many servers and having it result in dying populations.
---
Of course I imagine there will automatically be community-driven language servers.  I made this mistake of rolling on Blackrock in vanilla, which had huge populations because it just so happened to be an unofficial Australian server.
---
I would join this guys guild lol
---
Hmm I'm pretty disappointed then. This appear to confirm like Blizzard would rather throw band-aids on top of layering instead of actually removing it.
---
You're making a big list of quite asinine assumptions while all I'm saying is that joking about suicide is off limits. I gave an example of the effects. In reaction, you splurge kneejerk reactions. Other than that, rationalizing the futility of life is no reason to be ignorant of the effects of your actions on others. People don't have to be special to be treated with basic respect. You know it doesn't make it right.
---
Haha, I feel you man
---
I don't think people choosing horde or alliance are actually different it's mostly an esthetic preference. Personalities and age range or level of education wouldn't be a factor. Pick what you lile and you'll find find friends either way
---
Funny enough, the rolls of each rogue are in order of their place in the damage meters, never noticed that 🤯
---
If you plan on healing as druid I think it's a completely fine combo. Warriors mostly suffer from a lack of sustain and while you may not be the best at it early on the druid should be able to do that, plus cat form won't suffer too much from you being in less than optimal gear for leveling because you don't have to worry about your weapon as much.
---
efficient levelling = / = average   
---
most people are extremely inefficient xd
---
Back in vanilla there were free server transfers from high population to low population servers. It was Blizzards attempt to balance population. I don’t think they had paid server transfers back then.
---
The English only rule will be removed.
---
Should’ve booked the week after launch
---
God BO4 was a waste of money. I've been playing battalion 44 which is like an indie remake of cod4 promod and its given me loads more fun than BO4 ever did.
---
As a mage: BM hunter. Absolutely nothing you can do if they decide they want to gank you. When the pet goes red I know I’m dead.
---
Also warlocks.
---
On the other hand, I laugh at warriors and rogues who try to catch me. If the rogue doesn’t one shot me, he will never catch me. So funny to see them pop Sprint thinking it’s gonna matter.
---
Shadow priests don’t scare me if I have Ice Barrier. The ones I encounter are usually not good enough to kill me.
---
Leave it to Blizzard to create an unnecessary, convoluted solution to something that could be fixed - I assume - in a much easier way i.e., no layers after level 20 or only layer certain starting non-contested zones.
---
Druid's shouldn't have an issue getting into ZG/AQ as a Tank.
---
I can't think of many Raid fights outside of Pservers that a Paladin Tank can MT or Offtank effectively compared to Druid or War.
---
Once you have T2 for Paladin you can run 5 man's all day as a Tank though, it's getting that gear that takes time and commitment.
---
Then it boils down to: do you want to level with them, or do raids/pvp endgame with them?
---
I find Dwarf rogues are absolutely the type most likely to 'outplay' you with a thistle tea and spam emotes afterwards, At least on the Alliance side.
---
I don't want layering, is a problem to you? Oh wait, we all hail layering system, just to avoid tag fights for 24 hours...
---
Is better to be discussing about how timers should work for months. If X then Y, but only if Z, if not Z then Q, but just the first 4 times, then T to dump time to get to M, but if dungeons then N, but if level is 10 then V... omg.
---
Just fight 1 or 2 days and forget this shit of layering... or shut up ;)
---
Do you know if General/Trade chat is shared between layers? If it is, this will definitely be a problem unless players are named with their layer number as well, like "Legolass - Layer 3".
---
Yes. You're asking for experienced players to answer your question about the economy. So far you've gone out of your way to tell commenters why they're wrong and you're right. Listen to yourself, man. Can't you see you're kind of coming off like a dick?
---
Didn’t all those people hear classic is already dead. /s
---
I would be the warrior. I assume he could spec feral, and throw a few heals my way, as we tear through mobs. At least until 40+?
---
The one race you enjoy playing is the most optimal.
---
I predict my Orcish hands will be stained red with the blood of many dead gnomes, elves, humans, and dwarves.
---
Shhhhh! ClassicWoW isn't out yet and my house isn't built. Lets not celebrate too early..... (thank you though!).
---
Don't wanna jinx it!
---
&gt;**7:** Zul'gurub farm: Again, you need gear to get this
---
I was doing it as a fresh lvl 60 back in the day you really don't need that much stuff.
---
Das tough haha, but yeah that's the problem indeed... Hope they adress this
---
Like others have said, it doesn't matter much any more. I've played on some servers that shan't be named, and I've played extensively on both factions. I've experience largely the same types of friendships and interactions across both.
---
Not enough
---
If it's just that i guess it's alright then, forgot about those
---
Outland before AQ ???
---
also shitty music
---
Yeah it would've been better if they just let players create their character on a specified layer and kept them there permanently until the merge.
---
Wrong sub
---
Dungeons are instanced, it wouldn’t effect that.
---
Warcraft 3 custom games and CSGO battle Royale
---
So lvl 60 end game content then
---
Merging realms was absolutely atrocious.  The worst offender was the economy.  It just kills your will to even play the game anymore after your realm being merged with even 1 other.  I would hate to be playing on those realms that had 3 or 4 servers merge into one.  
---
You think you want merging realms, but but you don't =D
---
Wrong sub buddy
---
I thought i was going to log in to 8.2 yesterday... i didnt care enough to. I just want classic
---
Pirate Garb, bragging rights, and something fun to do.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if they did add paid transfers because they are a business afterall. I am quite curious as to how the populations and even faction balance will play out.
---
"And years of dedication, sacrifices and discipline" - me ;)
---
Again, I just haven't noticed this with melee but I totally understand when talking about shooting a wand or bow. Perhaps I'll pay closer attention to it next time I'm online.
---
Started on a classic server about 3 weeks ago. I love coming across content you completely forgot about when leveling.
---
Such a rush of good feels.
---
You comment implies that they acted on it because of the problem itself, not because of the outcry. My argument is that we won't ever possible know. It's retarded to call out people in this sub for criticising classic design decisions if there's a change it makes the game better
---
tl;dr - for most drop chances that you'd be tempted to calculate, you can assume if there's a 1/n chance of the drop then there's a 65%ish chance of the item dropping within n kills. The math is played with in more detail on the other subreddit.
---
Wait, is this what we're at now? People are just accepting that it'll be around longer? Damn this subreddit has fallen far.
---
You should also remember though that mitigation &gt; HP in terms of raid healing. That extra dodge means your healers are less taxed. Whether you think feral druids should be tanking raids... that's another story :D
---
I fell through the world and died at least once in vanilla, and remember it very vividly. It was going through one of the first dwarven tunnels of Dun Algaz, going from Dun Morogh to Wetlands. Good times!
---
DMW = Deadmines Westfall
---
There are already people spouting off about how this *proves* that Blizzard is going to keep layering in permanently, because they are taking the time to fix it. There is no pleasing some people.
---
Eh, a minority of it was perhaps feedback, MOST of the comments were simply dooming vanilla due to layering even existing, i.e "remove layering or vanilla is a fail" &lt; this is not feedback.
---
Yeah, most people that heal will spec dps while leveling because the talents aren't massive early on and having the dps will make a huge difference. First aid will be your best friend though. I'm personally leveling a priest that will be shadow until probably around 55-58 before I just spec holy and grind dungeons to 60.
---
I can't wait either! My productivity at work has gone down more than I'd like to admit as I watch all the hype for classic!
---
Why should anybody shut up about layering?
---
Thanks for calling out that idiot!
---
What's a Nazjatar?
---
Yeah warstomp is the big thing I'm jealous about as an alliance player.
---
Oops, you're right, sorry!
---
There are some abilities that can only be acquired by crafting various ability scrolls together. Some work by combining a scroll with a generic spelltype scroll, others need specific wind/etc spells to be crafted. Look them up there are a whole bunch
---
And they'll be right to complain.
---
Mage has some good aoe farms at endgame, probably some of the safest and strongest g/h.  That said, it might make more sense to just stockpile the mats as you level instead and then switch over professions, because then you can sell spares or at least not really drop as much gold upfront in order to level.
---
It depends how fast you lvl too though, it is possible, even likely, that you outlvl your mining profession unless you spend a lot of time working on it instead of lvling.
---
Even the guy who posted it isn't sure about that, and there aren't distinct steps or conditions posted here. Just a few triggers. Because really, what is the point of putting someone on a cooldown if they haven't even hopped once yet? And if you can't determine what the cooldown is, how will you know the time you must wait doing nothing to join some friends? Like would it really be   
---
1) I log in.  
---
2) 30 seconds later I kill a mob that gives me XP.
---
3) 2 seconds later my friend invites me to his group, but I can't see him because I'm locked out of joining a new layer.  
---
Or is it  
---
1) I log in
---
2) I kill a mob.
---
3) Friend invites me, I move to his layer.
---
4) We continue killing/questing
---
5) I try to hop again by joining another group, but I'm locked out of joining a new layer so shortly after hopping and doing stuff in my friend's layer.
---
This is true for many raids, haha.
---
"#nochanges" is a nice idea and a great place to start but even 14 years ago there were things we were bitching about that did eventually get changed.
---
It's one thing to give us back all the gloriousness we remember but it's another to go out of your way to include the shitty bits too.
---
Agreed.  This is just some fucking streamer.  Not credible.
---
There is a graveyard at the bottom of Darkshore, but since that is an Alliance zone the next closest one is probably Ashenvale - even though that is an Alliance town, the Horde should be able to rez there, but it's been a while since I have died as Horde in western Ashenvale. If that GY does not work for Horde, the next closest one is Splintertree. It could be that the game just decided that Splintree was somehow closer than Ashenvale. Welcome to Vanilla! :pepelaugh:
---
I wfh, so I have to be pretty disciplined. I find myself constantly having Asmongold or some Nixxiom/Frost video on in the background
---
In your defense, the post was a link to twitter.
---
Even though i'm french i was going to join an english server anyway, but it's because i'm willing and want to speak english. If people don't want to speak a certain language, give the people what they want, even if it's just 1 server per country..
---
When it comes down to 2 weeks, I hope they make he tough call and hard cap the server at 3-4K, no layers, and queue *the fuck* out of the game. Layering isn’t my ideal solution, but if it *truly* is 2 weeks long and Blizzard isn’t lying through their teeth, I can’t complain too much.
---
But I still foresee them extending it for all of phase one if the population doesn’t shrink enough, which would be pretty horrible. After the first 2 week rush, I would much rather sit in 3-4 hours of queue and get to play in The World of Warcraft than have immediate access to layerville.
---
Because it's the best option out there.
---
He should be using bartender with ctrl and alt 1 to = bound long before WASD are spell buttons..
---
I mean we don't need 50 servers like today, just one per type per language, why not? The impact would be much less. One french RP, one french PvE, one french PvP and that's it for example. Better than 10 per type per language like now. 
---
I'd rather have it quiet down later on than having a packed server that speaks 7 languages, gonna be hard to filter out your community. 
---
Like, look: If you play on a full server with different languages, you'll still wanna play with people who speak your language right? So in practice, you'll still play with 1/7th of the server, meaning around 400 people. So the result is the same. Sure it'll look bigger but you can't play with spanish people if you speak german, so why bother making it look big ?
---
Were you not around during the server merges of the past? Those are way, way worse than layers, and I'd rather have permanent layers than risk low pop servers getting merged. Server merges are just the worst.
---

---
King Bang was 1.4k attack speed.
---
Sounds good to me. Do you have experience if theres a level where rogues are going to have a much easier time because of a talent/ability?
---
You could go warlock, and then just run over to her zone.
---
So back in vanilla I was like 13-14 years old raiding MC/BWL. I got into an argument with another guild member about.... something, was probably my immaturity tbh. So I  threatened to quit the guild because of this ( In guild chat). Do note I was in this guild for like at least 8 months to a year. 
---
They kicked me, saying I was causing drama by threatening to leave the guild.
---
This was my vanilla drama, and I'm pretty sure I deserved it, but little ole 13-14yrold me was crushed :(
---
This is better news than i expected, if this is true. Making exploiting layer hopping alot more difficult, whilst not hindering grouping with friends too much. Great news all round. I still hope they stick to their guns and remove it altogether asap though.
---
That’s actually hilarious
---
Just a personal opinion, but people love lock players. Super useful for summons, soul stones, health stones, eye and the fact that they can be make shift tanks with pet sacs. The mount quests are also a great perk and I always found the quests for all the warlock stuff to be very immersing.
---
Shaman definitely have some of the most badass ass quests and diverse play styles depending on their spec.
---
Thanks. I'll sort it when I get home.
---
Kenshi, older game and engine but man its fun.
---
Not true.  I heard it both ways but on Spirestone US to the majority it was definitely VC.    If someone called it DM they got made fun of.
---
yeah 5-8 is dead on beta
---
but I mean of course it is when Tauren can hit you from 12 yards
---
Defense cap is insanely over glorified, 10 def is even less important.
---
YOU MORTALS ARE NOTHING TO MY KIND! DO YOU HEAR ME? NOTHING!
---
It's actually just one guy multiboxing over 100 accounts.
---
So if you invite a tank on another layer that still has a cooldown (because he's not just sitting around waiting to be invited to a dungeon), he won't be able to join your layer but if he makes it into the dungeon you will be together?
---
That works, I guess, though it would still suck for DM, WC, BFD, etc. where you have to fight your way past elites to even get into the dungeon.
---
Says who? Says Blizzard?
---
No Humar? Easily my favorite pet in the game.
---
This is big news to me. Thanks.
---
Dead game confirmed. 
---
Source: comment above
---
Wrong. I’m not talking about his fresh server launch video. He did this on a 1.12 repack (Empty server he is hosting locally).
---
It isn’t really because you can do Cookie first. That’s actually better too because you can clear a bit. I’ve had so many wipes because retard tanks jumped down and aggroed all the mobs behind the ship that we didn’t clear.
---
You should be defense capped if you're tanking the MC.  You'd still use the DD on heavy FR fights, though.
---
Diablo 2 ladder reset pretty recently and already have my sorc build completed. Saving up for Enigma now so I can get that hammerboi going.
---
Well I doubt it blocks you from joining the group, you would just not be able to see each other across layers. Layers have nothing to do with dungeons though, as they are on their own instance servers.
---
Example from live:
---
There are 2 kinds of shards, War Mode and Non-War Mode.
---
If I join a party, and some members have War Mode on, any one who has War Mode off will not be able to see them in the open world. Once we join the dungeon though, we have no such restrictions. Only issue really is trying to use the Summoning stone.
---
Shadowguard is more useful in pvp than DP. Only in 1v1 situations would DP possible by better
---
Just finished my sorc and working on my merc now before saving up for Enigma. I love this damn game.
---
Wouldn't there have to be language unofficial servers anyways?  Where do Finnish players play if there are only Italian, German, English, Spanish, and French realms?  Somebody gets excluded somewhere is my point.  It is going to suck, but it will be the less sucky version of wow.  I'll acknowledge I could be wrong about the assumptions I make thinking that the developer is making the right decision to support long term subscriptions to their game to still be fun.    
---
Look at other forms of online gaming.  The other gaming services like Sony, Microsoft, mobile games, and Steam have not made huge leaps towards language specific game servers that I am aware of.  How is this topic not as public and troublesome for those companies every time an online game is released?
---
I’m doing something similar except I know in the end it’s all gonna come down to how the character looks in combat. Really the only reason I am hesitating on druid. Planning to do the HotW do-it-all spec at 60 though, so maybe the variety will make it ok. I definitely couldn’t be only a bear or only a cat.
---
25% bonus to battle shout is incredibly small just FYI
---
Horde priest racials have nutty synergy with the shadow tree. Shadowguard, devouring plague and touch of weakness benefit from blackout, shadow weaving, vampiric embrace and damage increasing talents. Hex of weakness and devouring plague get increased range. 
---
Alliance priests have anti-synergy as desperate prayer, fear ward (and chastise in tbc) can't be used in shadowform. Starshards, elune's grace and feedback are lackluster. Stoneform is great though, breaks blind and removes viper sting which is a big deal with how quickly shadow priests go oom.
---
Overall: Undead=Troll &gt; Dwarf &gt;&gt; Human &gt; Nightelf
---
Nightelfs get a massive boost in TBC, but still undead is better there.
---
People also love shaman. Inevitably after the intial tourists die out, shaman seems to be the most sought-after raid class. Melee will never ever ever not want WF, and for many 40 mans their resistance totems and poison cleanse / tremor are BiS as well.
---
Rain world! I already won it, but I want to 100% it.
---
Pretty unique game which don't hold your hand. If you enjoy exploration, getting lost, are not afraid of dying and losing up to 6 mins of your time and scavenging for lore, this is a perfect game
---
Hopefully they don't though
---
I levelled a Hunter to 40 on a private server and the pet management has been the only thing that has turned me off. 
---
I'll be playing with a guild of friends that I've had since legion so I think the stigma isn't that huge of an issue for me. 
---
Thanks for the insight!!
---
Thats assuming they would pay attention to it? If there are no threads about this in the battle.net EU forums then it either isn't a problem or Blizzard will not see it as a problem. If the people this issue affects do not speak out about it then why would Blizzard care about people who this doesn't affect having an issue with it? Its nice to rally for something but this time I think its an issue that needs to be handled by EU players.
---
Druids after 40 feel incredibly good with dire bear, you can pretty much aoe farm most quests. They make really good offtanks for raids and going a class that can reliably tank pretty much guarantees getting your epic mount quickly due to being able to reserve expensive mats from some dungeons. Tanks are very in demand.
---
!RemindMe 2 years
---
This. You don't need to be at Def cap to raid. Hell most tanks step into raids with less than 400def.
---
Yeah. On launch, *everyone* is going to be playing, all at once. But after a while, the population will spread its play time out. Some people will play mostly on the weekends, some will only have time during weekday evenings, and some will play in the early morning before heading out.
---
I mean idk if you are just repeating the above statements but I said that it was an unoptimized raid build yet completely possible, id rather have a competent enhance player than a jerk who happens to have a better class for the build, but everyone here is trying to die on the hill that enhance is impossible to raid as when its just not optimal. I raided as enhance occasionally back in vanilla when we had an abundance of healers and we moved along just fine
---
If it is similar to live, it probably won't block you from joining, just from seeing each other (you won't change layers). You'll probably be able to tell with a UI element next to their names. That's how it works if people join a party on live, and say the party leader is not in War Mode, but the person who joins is. They are in a party, but they are on different types of shards.
---
Warrior priest or warrior shaman is what my buddy and I are going.
---
Howbout that one shield from ZG?
---
The decrease is greater than the gain, so you can't be exalted with both. Afaik, but I could be wrong
---
What is low pop for you ?
---
Lol a neck tattoo would be dope though
---
Well, I'm reluctant to choose alliance because of the potential try-hards it's advantages will attract. 
---
Not that I'm against them necessarily, but I'd rather choose horde if half of the alliance is going to be ignoring the "multiplayer" part of MMO, even if I prefer their aesthetic.
---
 Just an example.
---
Winterspring mount would be the hardest grind for phase 1.
---
CTR is out? Oh damn
---
Another rogue, or feral druid
---
Yes, its fine though because you'll only be enhancement for leveling anyway. Once you hit 60 raids only take resto shams due to the horrible dps shamans bring.
---
Not really trolling...
---
I hope the cool down is at least a 10 minutes long, but this is nice indeed.
---
Truefaith vestments are BiS for priests for quite awhile and are crafted with Tailoring.
---
Took me 26d /played to hit 60 on my first character.
---
I gots me a shiny new guild
---
Chuck Norris was here
---
Fair enough. So you think arms is superior for leveling?
---
Priest for her, warrior for you
---
Great game that's still enjoyable to this day. 
---
Enigma and infinity are so damn expensive right now on ladder. I'm going to have to do a lot of farming if I ever want to get an infinity.
---
you always find what youre looking for in the last place you look.
---
This is such an asinine attitude lol. 
---
They said they were implementing a system, and are refining/fixing it during beta. 
---
They aren’t throwing a band-aid on something if it’s not a problem that needs to be removed. It’s only a problem to you, not to them.
---
&gt; torn to *shreds* 
---
Pun intended? lol.
---
I am a huge proponent of feral tanking but it's looking like bear and cat forms may have been overtuned on pservers, meaning (with the new parry revelations) bear tanks might be less desirable than they already are.
---
If you want to tank, is there any reason you don't want to roll an alt?
---
Lol I leveled to 60 hemo spec just to survive world pvp. Pve rogue through and through at 60. Even at hemo spec while leveling I mainly used it to escape and run away, bravely.
---
I really believe that only due to flying being introduced changed the game completely, so for me Vanilla is one thing and all other expansions are an other. Yes, TBC might had better class design and balancing but due to flying it's as if it's a completely different game. So yes, it would be nice to have TBC servers but that also means the population will start dividing and then the floodgates will open: why stop on TBC while we can also have Wotlk etc.  
---
With Vanilla being horizontally extended as in adding content without necessarily increase the power level severely, they could play with interesting items and sets that might favour unpopular specs, maybe add mounts or flavourful items, play with current lore/see known heroes make appearances or even new factions with cool rewards,  and in general make that immense world even more rich while keeping the Classic philosophy the same.  
---
I guess at the end people will choose so there's no hard feelings going either way.
---
Lol I help horde with there quests when I run into them..... then I tank them after they think I’m nice &gt;:)
---
I don't recall being able to shower in World of Warcraft...
---
better stealth which is very important on lv 19 as a rogue against rogues.
---
Yes but defense cap conversation aside, I think from a number crunch standpoint the avoidance and less crit chance has a bigger overall impact that a little armor, stam, and block.
---

---
I wouldn’t say rogues are too hard to level, very high dodge chance, interrupts, sap, gouge, strong cds, stealth are all reasons they make great levelers. Personally if I wasn’t playing a tank warrior I’d be playing a rogue.
---
Old news.
---
You'll get tryhards on both sides. Just pick what you kind of architecture you want to look at for the next two years.
---
Lower dpi doesn't mean anything - most CS pros play on ~400dpi, but the ping point is likely the best one. Considering I used to have 90 ping and 50 ms server lag to 32 ping altogether today.
---
Neither will be in Phase 1 though.
---
I've played both but really the decision came down to what faction are my friends playing.
---
Been reading about MotB like 10 sec ago, spooky
---
You can Tank all of MC and Ony with Deflector. The FR is nice to have from DD on a few fights but not necessary as you can get it from other sources.
---
If you have one I wouldn't stress about getting the other.
---
In before "But we have to stay vigilant or Blizzard will ruin things. We're the only ones who can do this, obviously Blizzard won't change anything unless we yell about it constantly."
---
Look at the post right below this - see anything similar?
---
Those animations really do your videos justice. Nice work.
---
What you're saying doesn't, didn't, and has never existed.  If you didn't know any flight points connected to that point, you got a message "you don't know any flight points connected to this."  There was no "more straight line".
---
You can't guarantee it worked like that, because it didn't.
---
How long is the cooldown?
---
isnt this going to last like 2 weeks at most ? is it going to be so frustrating ?
---
I am sorry....but what exactly do you want?  No cooldown when swapping layers?
---
If a player is delayed by couple minutes upon joining a friend's group...that is MORE THAN OK, considering that everything in Vanilla takes a lot of time.
---
2 minutes is NOTHING. But ENOUGH to combat resource gathering.
---
Probably true, seems to be hard for blizz to admit they fucked up.
---
Well, for me I'll be grinding Orgrimmar rep because I don't want to ride on a Kodo. That's going to be a bit painful, but I'll do it.
---
The steam sale couldn't have come at a better time to be honest. I'd found myself going back to modded Minecraft for the first time in years I was that desperate.
---
I'm thinking of picking up Mordhau and Divinity 2, and maybe trying Outward. Should be more than enough to tide me over these 2 months.
---
No, the modification of it is what feels wrong, type of mod irrelevant.
---
Taking a picture of a building is a far cry from photo-shopping someones artwork and lets be honest, you know that already.
---
Lets take the Special Editions of the Star Wars movies for example.  Modification of some original pieces that most ( not all ) would agree was a ba idea.  Comparing the simplistic thing you've done to a song remix or movie parody just seems like reaching man.
---
Your step by step attempt to justify your re-color of a meta WoW art post just strikes me as a pointless discussion.  You did it, you posted it, and got yourself some karma.  Good job.
---
I'm planning on having a warrior tank main, and a hunter alt for farming and possibly for PvP.
---
Would it be better to level up the alt first and start earning gold, or level up the tank first and start farming gear?
---
20 is a big deal due to poisons, Blade Flurry also helps. Not much else for Rogues to look forward to imo.
---
At low gear level, i would still expect most hybrids to be above.
---
You should probably do the same as soon as you start playing so that you don't develop bad habits using the keyboard to move.
---
Let me find some of the weirdo things you said back then. I'll post them or send them your way later today
---
Just fyi but battlegrounds wont be in until phase 3 I think, and just WSG at that point.  So the only pvp we'll have for a long time will be wpvp...  which is super fun, it just might not take up as much time as we hope right away.
---
If you think that waiting for 2 minutes in Classic is a big deal...you should NOT be playing Classic. Not even 10 minutes waiting in Classic is a big deal.
---
As I said, this is pretty much personal preference. For me, solving a theoretical underpopulation problem by merging all languages onto the same servers upfront without proof that this may be necessary in the first place is far worse than making an educated decision based on actual facts after they at least *tried* to separate languages.
---
Also: Of course I don't want merging realms. It's just what I'd prefer if I got to choose.
---
It's a problem to a lot more people than just me. I know it's not a problem to Blizzard.
---
Oh shit, ZG isn't in Phase 1? Guess that makes sense since it was added later, I just assumed they'd turn it on with MC since it was easier.
---
Why not use both 2H and 2 1H? It would be a little slower to level the weapon skills but you could have a macro to change weapons so you 2H skills like overpower (which its interesting to use with you idea of a fast offhand)
---
It’s entirely possible
---
Delusion
---
Confirmed on a 1.13 client you can jump across without any movement increasing effects if jump from the right place (Look it up on YouTube). Even if you didn’t want to do this, it’s very likely you will he able to buy a swiftness pot which is most probably worth the 80s or so.
---
 Even if sit to crit was working I would still level arms. 
---
With Fury you would get the enrage talent at lvl 25 and finish it at lvl 29. Piercing Howl is nice but you can live without it. 5% crit from cuelty is very good of course. Also unbridled wrath.
---
Arms at 27 for comparison would have 5/5 tactical mastery which makes for smooth and fun gameplay. Feels much better tanking dungeons having it. Anger Management is very useful even though it might not seem like it. You get 1 rage every 3rd second in combat and decays slower out of combat as well of course. You get 50% crit for overpower and deep wounds and impale. Early levels having 3/3 rend helps a bit with the leveling as well. 
---
 With sit to crit then yes maybe it's objectively  better to go Fury. Tactical Mastery however sells it for me to go arms anyways. As I wrote it is just more fun gameplay wise which counts for a lot in my book.
---
Yes, I find it logical and exciting to experiment with the choice they missed this time rather than try to just replay the WoW franchise all over again. I believe since they won't have the financial pressure this time, they could go all out with that long-missed Blizzard creativity on a game that deserves the right attention.
---
oh , ill take this down then. i just uploaded haha
---
Oh I thought it was a typo

He's just some fucking streamer who has made a full time job out of creating World of Warcraft related content. I'm by no means a fan, but the people with beta access are the only people able to tell us what is going on on the server. Blizzard has released no patch notes whatsoever relating to changes on the beta beyond updating their bug trackers. 
---
Dude has a huge following because he spends a lot of time creating high quality, accurate WoW content. He loses a lot of credibility with that fan base (who also happen to be his primary source of income) if he just starts making crazy shit up for clicks.
---
LMAO
---
I expect a 2 min CD. Plenty of time to combat resource gathering. During launch, a node is surviving maybe 30 seconds.
---
2 minutes it just great : not long for waiting to join a group, but long enough to deter layer hopping for resources.
---
The reason I think it was 6 letters is because I have a 7 letter name and had to come up with a nickname when I played pokemon blue. But as I said, I could be wrong. It was some 20 ish years ago after all.
---
So what is Blizzard stance? I did see a few posts on the classic forums but they were not in English. Has any blue responded? Are a lot of EU players posting in those threads?
---
Get an owl, better stats than carrion bird and more Armor (less down time) than cats + screach - aoe tanking.
---
Hahah , wow you raced me to posting it here. well done   
---
Also, thanks! :D

TIPS had a video about server clusters like Illidan #1, Illidan #2, Illidan #3 and as population went down they would merge them.  He had concerns about things like duplicate names and auction house mergers messing with the economy.  But wouldn't it be possible to have all the players on separate servers but program it so all the servers shared one auction house?  Also, couldn't you link the name database so that a name could only be used once in the server cluster?  I feel like this would be a good alternative to layering.
---
Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything?
---
Doesn't that trigger both the GCD and reset the swing timer?
---
Except they will more than likely turn around and spend that gold in the Auction House. Which is increasing the money supply in the market place. Then the people who don't engage in those TOS breaking activities suffer because their gold is worth less.
---
I’ve always used a combination of both but predominantly mouse. Sometimes its easier to just take a step or two back by pressing S. But It seems I’m in the wrong
---
I agree, but the utility and honestly scarcity of warlocks cant be understated. I think shamans will be played a bit more.
---
You monster!
---
They'll remove it eventually. It's down to the whether it's better having game broken by layering for 3 weeks, or semi-fixed layering for 3 months. 
---
I don't think anyone can answer that. But it looks like there's a discussion going and Blizzard is willing to adjust things the community is worried about.
---
Cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria!
---
For me, it was the beta that really got me hooked
---
Yes it’ll come in much later. Phase 4 is ZG and AV will be Phase 3.
---
Yea I know. But stv is goin to be a kind of bg I suppose
---
well in vanilla, at least on the first servers i was on (Arthas, Azgalore), horde were outnumbered by far. while we'd derisively call alliance "kiddies", i'm quite sure the mix of young and old was the same on both factions. you quickly made friends as you had to LFG and you'd blacklist whoever had bad manners.
---
however, due to us horde being outnumbered, the average player on horde was better at PvP than the average alliance. we used to dominate them in PvP, when not zerged.
---
Horde have 400lb neckbeards, alliance have rpers
---
Its easier but there is not really a time you wouldnt be better off strafing backwards.
---
thanks man, happy you like them haha
---
Thanks so much for your input!
---
Appears it was to tune down layering..also...tuesday
---
Leave it to Reddit to completely misunderstand something and complain about it anyway.
---
I've only ever done this with the same class, but I think you could do it by strategically keybinding and using a mouse with a lot of buttons on it for one character (probably the mage). Now I want to try this with Hunter/Mage for PVP (infinite kites).
---
Stats say opposite bud
---
That’s cool. I don’t even know what HFC means bc I quit in early tbc since I finally was 15 and started touching pussy.
---
?? Its not a permanent fixture, its being removed
---
Of the few guilds I was in on vanilla, I was really surprised at how many starts they used felt really different, just because they encouraged standing near a wall to stare at it.
---
Yeah, I was just a kid back then having fun not caring about end game or whatever else. Just doing whatever gave me enjoyment! That’s why there’s so much nostalgia surrounding classic
---
Yes they are. It's just a very rare and expensive pattern that can be replaced in BWL, so overall I dont believe tailoring gives a significant advantage over the other professions for a priest. 
---
You could always craft the robes and then drop tailoring if you wanted. There are many options!
---
It's because you're mounted so it immediately falls off.
---
Don't base your whole decision on what levels well, it's not that big of an issue.
---
Anything that heals will pair well with warrior, druid warrior will work just fine and definitely better for the warrior compared to individual levelling. You can have easy dungeon access from having a tank and healer (all the druid really needs is a gear set to heal low level dungeons).
---
Its a good combination for world PvP too. Roots and heals synergises well with a warrior's toolkit so you should get some fun fights with the druid appearing from stealth to surprise would-be gankers.
---
Honestly if that's the combination you were drawn to - go for it there's absolutely no reason not to.
---
I heard this was adjusted with the latest patch so not entirely sure, but from the last stress test I had no problems out running nearly every mob. Few exceptions were mobs with speed relating to their name like "packrunner" or "fleeting plainstrider", or mobs with a charge/speed boost ability. I'd say the ratio of most mob:player was probably 0.95 to 1, meaning mobs were slightly slower than players in most cases. I played 2 hunters 1-15 and 1-10, and both of them were relatively easy to kite things with. I could literally just run in circles and a mob never catch up to me
---
I'm rolling female dwarf. Love those sexy curves and those sexy heals
---
lmao, well I'll just let my upvotes and your downvotes do the talking XD
---
Good to hear! Makes layering a lot more bearable for the short term.
---
Couldn't you turn in supplies too for reputation?
---
Best class to multi-box in Classic? I have multiboxed in the past using Shaman with chain lightning, but something like a priest so I can chain fear and multidot might be good as well.
---
I played LoL and Dota 2 for years, hundreds of hours back in high school and college. I just can't handle 45+ minute matches anymore, even if it's more casual HotS is still a blast and satisfies my itch for that genre. Plus the Smash Bros-esque Blizzard all-stars lineup is still cool.
---
There's still room for carrying and outplaying but it's obviously much smaller than the others, but on the other side the downside for someone on your team sucking/feeding is less too.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I feel like ZG always served as a nice little segue into MC, though.
---
A decent hunter will be able to keep up tho y’alls travel form is the same speed.
---
I agree that 3 min CD on DP is heavy, but that spell single handed  decides PVP encounters, the damage it does together with the healing is just insane. 900 base alone add the 15% Shadow weaving, 10% darkness and, 15% shadow form (all additive in 1.12) 40% increase for a total of 1300 damage because Vampiric embrace still works you get extra 30% HP so 1700HP recovery.
---
It scales insanely with Spell damage since it gets full +40% benefit on damage and +70% on healing. 
---
There is no spell in the game that has more impact. Maybe POM? but that makes the entire class a 3 min thing. 
---
Shadowguard has a chance to proc blackout that may help you here and there.
---

You’re gonna end up in a lot more leather than one piece, but I agree with avoiding cloth for stacking spirit.

**TLDR;** What is the purpose of grinding out raids, if your not having fun while you do it? Seriously why hang out with assholes when you play the game to have fun..
---
**Long version.**
---
I don't think you get it.
---
If I can't raid with my main, and I can't play with my main when I'm not raiding then I'm in the wrong guild.
---
You seem to think that absolutely every guild is going to elitest jerks, that will ignore everything except threat, heal  and dps meters.  Which makes sense if you're going for a World First, Server First environment. Or if the guild is just goofing off and trying to set a guild best clear time.  However there is a ton more to raiding than meters. It's like a dps that refuses to dispe/clense/cure/cc/purge because they are worried about their meter. 
---
I have no problem walking away from elitist raid leaders.  Gear is a mathematical certainty, Eventually I'll get everything anyway.  I might as well enjoy the time and company I spend that time with.
---
You are all assuming there are enough people that speak each language to populate each separate server.  Blizzard doesn't think that and they have the numbers.  If they have 5 servers total for the EU, what languages do you assign to each of those 5?  Obviously English gets 2, because that's the most popular language.  So how do you assign the last 3 servers to all of the languages that people would like to speak?  I keep hearing French, German, Italian, Greek, Spanish etc. so that's more than 3 languages.  Pick only 3 of those languages with enough population to fill 3 more servers.
---
If you don't like the way a dungeon run will be handled (when stated in advance) then you don't join that run. PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
---
Just to be clear, I never claimed any ownership over this piece. 
---
&gt;Comparing the simplistic thing you've done to a song remix or movie parody just seems like reaching man.
---
I wasn't comparing this to a remix. You said:
---
&gt;I personally do not believe people should modify art.
---
Most people consider songs to be art. Remixes are modifications of songs. I was curious if you thought remixes shouldn't be done.
---
I’ll be playing female undead warrior mostly based on animations. I love that female undead fly around and have a lot of movement in their attacks. If I played anything else it’d be Tauren, but they’re just too bulky for me. 
---
Warriors are tougher to level, but I love tanking and setting the pace for my dungeons. It’s really annoying going from tank to playing something like dps and thinking, “Man this tank has no clue what they’re doing.” 
---
If I didn’t play warrior I’d play rogue and being the biggest BMing ganker around.
---
The ultimate question....horde or alliance in classic?
---
This is so f--king accurate! haha
---
Gnome prot warrior top tier. Nice.
---
Probably it will be a 2 minutes CD. Short enough not to affect grouping, but long enough to discourage resource exploit.
---
Also, it might be additive, 2 minutes for first layer hop, 4 minutes for second, 6 minutes for 3rd.
---
During launch, nodes don't survive past 30 seconds after respawning, so 2 minutes will be more than fine for a layer hop internal CD.
---
Everyone says owls have better stats, but they really don't.  They have higher damage, but lower tank stats than a carrion bird.
---
The other problem with owls is that they cannot learn Bite.  Claw and Screech are essentially mutually exclusive, in that unless you micromanage it, you're only going to be using one of them at a time.  Both have no cooldown, so whichever one is further left on your action bar will be used.  You can put Bite to the left of Screech and make use of both, due to the cooldown of Bite.
---
I cant wait to get ganked in my 30s, and then come back to gank in my 50s
---
When a person has "Crazy Chic" on her instagram, you should probably believe her.
---
Not getting FPs is a bad idea.
---
There are some FP routes that are faster if you take a manual route with different stops rather than the automatic one. I don't remember any specifically but I've heard players talking about this.
---
"Blizzard has a track record of incompetence, why would I trust them here?"
---
Awesome, that’s really the answer I was looking for. Thanks for that!
---
I think I would enjoy the expansions of 1.12 more than moving to tbc. 
---
I felt so heartbroken when all I had worked for in vanilla basically became replaced by greens and all rep grind became pointless. 
---
It would probably become so none the less if the game would start expanding from 1.12 and onward but, hopefully it would be less abrupt and take way longer
---
I really want to go shaman but my guild is going alliance :( so i think i’m settling for mage...but i have been considering warlock lately :D
---
If you mean grouping for quests with random people who you see working on the same thing the cool down will never be a problem because if you can see them they're already on the same layer as you.
---
Oh so now we're up to 3 months? Are you guys just going to keep moving the goalposts until you start defending permanent layering?
---
I'd rather just have an overpopulated starting area. A few days of it being "unplayable" (which is bullshit anyway), is much better than 3 weeks or 3 months of layering. But I get it, modern wow fans want convenience above all else and Blizzard is doing this with them in mind.
---
Nice meme l
---
I don't have Petopia open at the moment.  He's slower than Broken Tooth, and not worth the effort to gain as a Night Elf.
---
People on the beta have been able to get sit enrage despite the fix, but it's unreliable and requires precise timing (this is the way it worked in vanilla).
---
Because old blizzard could have done this.  There is room for improvement on old wow, but the people who own wow now are physically incapable of improving it, any change they would make would be bad ones.  Because it would be driven by profits, the creative passion at blizzard left long ago.  
---
We already know what current blizzard would change if they were allowed, its retail.
---
i see, that sounds like an interesting job. for the record i am not defending nor bashing streamers (i don't have an opinion) but i feel like a lot of people don't see what they do as a ''real job'' and just go, well if you don't like this aspect then quit, when it's not that simple. i do agree that asking people not to kill you on a pvp server is stupid, but so is writing big fanfic about Killing The Streamers
---
I'd rather just stack strength/stam gear and bandage between fights. At least that way if I get ganked by a rogue I stand a change at winning. I recently leveled a warrior to 60 on a pserver and got to 60 in 7 days, not bad at all. No hamstring kiting either.
---
2h arms with stacking spirit (I wouldn’t do cloth) is the most optimal way to level a warrior. His advice is partial accurate.  
---
Also, DO NOT forget about Staves (Staff). The staff you get from Hogger quest will take you until you get Staff of Westfall from DM quest. Yes, you take this over the pants.  
---
Spirit &gt; Agi &gt; Str &gt; Stam  
---
Spirit - this will allow you to regen out of combat much quicker and will also not make you AS reliant on food/bandages. Warriors and Rogues get exponentially more benefit from Spirit than all other classes. By lvl 29 you can have close to 90hp per 5 OOC which is crazy good. A lot of this spirit comes from Staff of Westfall. Would you rather kill a mob in 15 seconds and spirit regen health instantly or take 12 seconds by stacking Str and now you have to bandage or eat food.....  
---
Agi - Warriors at every level rely on Crit. Crit procs deep wounds which accounts for a good chunk of your dmg at low levels.  
---
Str - Strength is very good, but at low level, do not prioritize it over Spirit or Agil. After you get to 40 you can re-evaluate your path. Also, at soo low of level and the Str you get off gear, 1 Str on an item equates to nothing in dps. But that 1 spirit is huge.  
---
Stam - if you are still alive after fighting 1 or 2 mobs, then you have enough Stam. If you are dying or too close to call, get more Stam. That’s how Stam works.  
---
This is not based on pserver data, this is how warriors should be played to be most optimal. It won’t look pretty when you have spirit gear and a staff. But you with laugh at others when you can pull mobs nonstop.
---
I would assume cities aren't layered.  Mobs are the main reason for layers,  and that isn't an issue in cities.
---
Why would you have zg in when it invalidates almost all of the early loot
---
This is exactly the kind of shit that keeps it going. "Nobody calls it X" pretending the other sides position is unthinkable.

i mean two people on seperate layers are farming or questing and organize a dungeon in chat, then one of them has to stop what hes doing for a while as to not gain xp so they can form the group. or i am misunderstanding something
---
DM is deadmines, end of story.  
---
Dire maul is: DM E, DM W or DM N / Tribute
---
TL:dr?
---
It looks like...FOR YOU. It doesn't, for me.
---
Layers will be gone, regardless of what you or I think.
---
This internal CD is just to prevent resource exploiting and PvP...for as long as layers exist.
---
There is NO LOGICAL reasoning to ASSUME that layering will be forever...because of an internal CD added to prevent EXPLOITING.
---
To think that actually means what you think it means...well, that is a screwed up logic.
---
Basically just retail Arena.
---
Battalion 44 and Dota Autochess (Underlords)
---
Ask yourself, did the days between announcement and now really matter?
---
This is great news. I doubted that they would find a solution until release but hearing this makes me hopeful.
---
Why would horde care about saving the deeprun tram tho? Do we get to join the pirates as an alternative quest to invade the tram where as the alliance fight off the pirates?
---
They aren't trolls different servers called it different things
---
Have a good one man, if you need to win an arguement, go ahead and tell yourself you won.  I honestly don't care to continue.
---
Shoutouts to CSGO Danger Zone unironically the best BR out right now
---
At what level? That's really the core of the argument.    
---
Fury is very strong, but lacks a little on tier 3/4. Arms on the other hand has tons of goodies for leveling all the way through its lower tiers. Anger Management in particular is awesome as is Imp. Charge.    
---
So the OP's argument of Arms until Bloodthirst unlocks makes a lot of sense. If people never want to respec then Fury is likely "the" leveling tree, but if you're willing to respec @ 40, then Arms into Fury may be superior (assuming DW with both).
---
Ok let me explain this to you slowly.  Blizzard doesn't think there will be enough population to sustain 3 servers for each language.  It's really not a difficult concept to understand.
---
Nice! good job. Keep making these please. /s
---
I don't see why not
---
Low quality B8
---
Just eat the 1g repair bill from res sick and call it a night.
---
Your crit protection comes from your shield block ability, that's why you don't need to be def capped. The practical comparison is 1.2% avoidance vs. the stam, armor, and block value of drillborer. You might even use drillborer for the damage reflection before you get a force reactive disc on aoe packs. 
---
Every raiding warrior should have the drac deflector. If I were the MT I'd want both. If not the MT it probably doesn't matter too much, though I'd still favor drillborer for most encounters.
---
But it doesnt affect every fight. If you are like most people you will have a hard time justifying using it unless of course it's a 1v1 which wont happen much in bgs. The main issue is its mana coat and cooldown. If you spend 1000 mana on shadow guard you would also do 1300 dmg but you will have had 12 chances at 10% to proc blackout and applied full stacks of shadow weaving. 
---
The chance for a rogue to stun himself during an opener can be understated either. As well as it proccing against casters. 
---
I cant argue that devouring plague isnt kne of the most powerful spells in the game but it's also one of the most costly. In 1v1s is dominant but in extended pvp shadowguard will end up doing more dps and costing less while also providing the potential to stun
---
How long it lasts will depend on how quickly the initial rush drops off.
---
The point is the be able to explore the full world under the classic constitution.

ON A BETA SERVER....THAT IS USED FOR TESTING.
---
Exploits in beta are GOOD...you get this? They are GOOD, because once they are discovered and popularized, they are GONE.
---
Layering hopping in beta is AN EXPLOIT...and Blizzard added an internal CD to nullify it.
---
People should shut up about layering now.
---
The ONLY downside to layering is layer hopping resource / PvP exploit...and now its GONE.
---
I won’t check it, as I don’t play hunter any longer, but carrion birds were tier 2 (in my mind). I think that they had another disadvantage. Nevertheless, if you don’t think that you can handle both abilities individually, then I would suggest a cat.
---
People do cookie afterwards wtf? What if you wipe and the group breaks up? Cookie is super easy, so no chance of not doing VC if you do Cookie first. Weird
---
Can someone explain what layer hopping is?
---
I'm pretty sure they can. What makes you think they can't?
---
The Tommy Joe Stonefield/Maybell Maclure story is super funny to me where the grandma’s plan to get them together isn’t to mend the families but to get invisibility potions made.  Also Billy Maclure being a menace to the Stonefield family would be a funny Easter egg in the background. Is this what you mean?
---
English is spoken in the UK, as well as a neutral language for everyone else. French is spoken in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland. And you'd give only one server for french? France has 60 millions people, Belgium around 12 millions, one server wouldn't be enough for the tiniest estimate of french speaking players. And don't get me started on german which is also spoken in more than one country. 
---
Retail has more than one full servers which are french specific, why would Classic have none? This makes zero sense.
---
Lol no it's not. Travel form is 61% with the pvp set and hunters is only 30...not even close.
---
The get rich fast scheme that I usually do (but may avoid this time) is to just make a budget smiter. You can buy 3xkeysets for half what the unid torches are worth. That's how I buy my enigma every ladder. Honestly though it makes me finish my pally build in like a month and then get bored of the game, so I may avoid it this time around and just get torches for my characters.

I used film until 2008 because my phone was a Siemens MC60 with a camera resolution of 352x288, and usable digital cameras were expensive as fuck. Even the point and shoot ones that were about had pretty shitty optics. Our school had [a digital camera that took 3.5in floppy disks](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Sony_Mavica_FD100), and that was released in 2002 and cost the modern day equivalent of about £700.
---
If that’s what 1 shard looks like then why are people complaining? If anything they need more shards...
---
This is a good change and makes the most sense.  Can't see any downsides to this that don't outweigh the possibility of exploitative player behaviour were it not to be implemented.
---
They said in Blizzcon interview that the layering won't be there to stay for more than phase 1. That's probably 3-4 months, also can be 3 weeks. Anything on that scale.
---
It won't be only unplayable, it would be complete shitshow. They should go for the first 3 weeks and &lt;20 lvl zones. But we don't know the technical side of things, so maybe it's not really possible and this is the best solution we might get.
---
yup that's the eternal problem, not having an official status means not everyone knows about it
---
Fresh start p server
---
I'm pretty sure they've openly said that vanilla WoW at the time of BC release was not a finished product. Given more time, they almost certainly would have addressed class balance and itemization more, filled in missing content, and even fixed technical issues like the debuff limit.
---
They stated that they will translate back the names of the places and names in English : [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/fr/wow/t/localisation-de-wow-classic/13905](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/fr/wow/t/localisation-de-wow-classic/13905)
---
I have a whole folder of #1 kills and/or damage on my rogue.  It's not a "once in a while" thing.
---
But if you just want to pad the damage meters, go a ranged class and sit in the back.
---
i had both on my warrior. i got rid of the draconion once drillborer dropped as the raw stats were better. don't remember anything about "defense cap" but as a warrior, you always have shield block up so you're not getting hit with crushing blows.
---
Shhh let them think DP is better. Ive tried many times but they insist the completely situational DP is better. A good priest will save DP til they have a specific 1v1 matchup that they would need it (BGs). If you're using it once every 10 minutes, then I don't see how it's better than SG which is up all the time, and procs Blackout.
---
BUT BUT WOTF... Yeah, super useful for that one alliance warlock you see a month.
---
Does anyone actually remember any of the private servers being unplayable past 24-48 hours, with no sharding?
---
Dwarf is very strong. They get desperate prayer and fear ward which are both excellent (fear ward replaces the need for WotF), and stoneform, frost resistance are useful in certain matchups too. No one racial would be called 'the best' but as a whole they are top tier in both PvP and PvE, just as trolls are for horde.
---
The other alliance races are fine. Perception and shadowmeld aren't terrible - they are just situational. If appearance isn't a factor and you just want to be the best race then pick dwarf or troll. Don't let it stop you picking the race you like most though, racials are never a dealbreaker.
---
Honestly Undead are overrated. The troll racials are almost as good as an Undead's in PvP and are the best in PvE, unlike the Undead which bring almost no value to PvE. They do look pretty great though, I'll give them that.
---
The entire world is layered, so that includes cities. Besides, General chat exists in every zone, not just cities.
---
no blue response apparently so far... I didn't go through all EU posts obviously but it's clear that the population of non-english speakers are huge.

Me and my friends called that Anti-ZG. Another great one was Anti-ZF. Walljump out of the instance portal and you have a massive unfinished tanaris to explore.

There are so many places we didn't get to fully explore that we'll never be able to since both blizzard and private servers have put wall jumping in its grave.

You'll have to be patient to get to Nefarian though. The Vaelastrasz fight was a guild buster. This game has a lot of built in filters.

I agree that nelfs are amazing for arena pvp, but I am not sure if they are better in classic.
---
This is my planned priority list. The degrees of "grind" varies.
---
- Levelling
---
- Start establishing contacts with players you group up with to do content in the future. Inside and outside of your guild.
---
- Your level 40 Mount
---
- Being able to purchase all of your spells/skills
---
- Your MC/Onyxia attunements
---
- Starting the Hydraxian Waterlords rep
---
- Starting the Argent Dawn rep so that you can turn in scourgestones from your endgame dungeons
---
- Finish levelling up your professions
---
- Getting your pre-raid Best in Slot
---
- Finding your gold-making niche: solo dungeon running, mob grinding routes, playing the AH, gathering herbs/ore/skins, crafting a niche market, etc.
---
- Getting as close to Revered with your race's faction as possible to reduce the cost of your Epic Mount training
---
- Getting the patterns for your raid consumables and/or making friends with someone who has them. 
---
- Being able to afford your raid consumables regularly and setting up enough time to get Felwood plants and Un'goro bombs.
---
- Worm your way into the good graces of your loot council or guild leadership.
---
- Your Epic Mount
---
- A PVP set with as much armor/stamina as you can get.
---
In fact a piece like this, a creative company will be comfortable paying up to $2000 or if it’s a bigger contract the day rate is very comfortable.

I... I said what if it's two hours... Two minutes would be too few, enough to exploit imo, so 10 minutes would be a good deal. Just wondering
---
But....their track record....
---
Well beta basically is, but anyone saying classic as a whole is might be an idiot
---
Ninjaname Angwe on every realm and you're good to go
---
I'm just upset that Bolvar wouldn't attack the Drake that got brought to Stormwind.
---
Kinda cool but not very thoughtfully put together. Kinda feels like the author / editor just found the first youtube footage he could that purported to be from a particular year, captured it and smashed it all together. 
---
Would probably have been a lot cooler if the evolution of WoW was demonstrated through clips of well known PVP'ers or machinima makers or at least had any sort of theme to what content is being shown...
---
Well, if not layering, what else?
---
I feel like they could also simply force you to go to an inn to change layers. Would this not solve the issues as well?
---
Isn't it mainly just weapons and a few other niche pieces? 
---
I can't remember anyone ever wearing the ZG faction armor.
---
Wow that's sick, exploration might be alive after all?
---
I'm sorry, but go fuck yourself. Every post I see you in you've been talking about how any solution would be better than what they were planning on doing. When they begin to test solutions, you come out and shit on the idea again. Stop trolling and either provide what you actually want, or stop complaining and get out of here.
---
I was hardcore gonna be undead cause of aesthetics and stuff and old pvp vids. But after reading more about shadowguard I cant deny its usefulness anymore. Even if you dont go shadow you could take blackout and it would still be an amazing spell. I expected it to not proc against spells but it does that too! Plus after looking through dmg and mana costs it would basically do the same dmg for the same mana cost but have all the blackout and shadoweaving procs. The only downside is less healing.

Gotta get all of summer's sun in now because I won't be seeing much of it in two months.
---
because everyone likes to complain. gamers are never satisfied
---
Until you get WW pretty much all of your attacks are swing timer based so your dps is locked. Also you don’t get hit hard enough to generate that much rage.  
---
HS kiting is the most optimal method, but, does not have to be used to level.
---
As far as I know, you can only pre create 3 chars... otherwise this would be an outstanding move xD
---
this sounds horrible, how do they want to sell people on the vanilla feeling with this shit?
---
I gotta say I dont think beastmaster hunter, particularly troll, is most challenging. Broken tooth was largely considered an absolute shut down to cloth casters. The 1 sec attack speed meant you could push back a spell cast indefinitely. Add on intimidate and it's over.
---
I think people's definition of "playable" is very different from mine. It seems like everyone else wants to rush through quests by themselves with zero competition. They want maximum convenience without any downtime. And if they can't do that, they declare the entire game unplayable.
---
There's so much more stuff to do than grinding quests. As long as the server can handle the population, bring it on! I don't care if I can't quest for a few days. A few days of uncoordinated chaotic fun vs months of layering? Shit I'd even pay extra for the former option.
---
Yeah and I'm telling you it's probably wrong. 
---
Either if it's based on Vanilla launch or on BfA's numbers, it could be way off since launch might have been less popular in EU for the first months before spreading, and BfA is doing poorly. 
---
Even so, BfA still has 4-5 french servers being tagged as either high pop or "full" for Archimonde, so how does this make any sense to you? Hence this post.
---
That's a big blanket. One could argue that farming gold while leveling will get your 40 mount faster therefore increasing leveling speed
---
If you're on a pvp server the nightelf shadowmeld+cat prowl combo is just too good to pass up. Plus cats do the most damage. If you're not leveling as BM owls can be a good option, great at holding aggro with screech, do more damage than carrion birds.
---
Wind serpent attack speed does not affect their ranged lightning's breath attack. Good pet but not for BM as you want a fast attack speed and low energy dump for increased frenzy uptime. Boars: same issue and also low damage.
---
This is PVE lee way not pvp.
---
Correct from other zones,  but there is a invisible wall leaving every city where you layer.  That leads me to believe it's not layered like the outside world. Sucks seeing people disappear right in front of you leaving a city, but could be worse. Otherwise if cities were layered the same as outside,  you wouldn't get people phasing in and out.
---
In AV or any large scale PVP shadowguard is better. In smaller BGs like WSG or AB where fighting gets close and personal sometimes the though of DP instills horror into your opponent, unless they are a dwarf. They are not afraid of DP because of the Racial.
---
Hydration agreed, reasonable sleep after if you mean 5 hours tops. Showering is for the weak and those that interact irl - This is inefficient time management.

If you shit in my cereal, I'm still allowed to complain even after I've dumped it out.
---
I personally feel like hunter should be higher up. They are absolute monsters in WPVP. The best class by far because of tracking humanoids and their ability to outrange every class provides for some nasty ganked. Their dueling is pretty solid too, only being really beaten by a Spriest or a SL Lock (and if it’s a horde hunter the chance of facing a PvP alliance warlock is slim). Mages can be tricky but it’s a matchup that can definitely be learned. Hunter group pvp is also outstanding and most battle ground groups take two. Their damage is great in groups and viper sting and traps provide for some good utility. They can do so much in PvP solo or in groups and in my opinion one of the best PvP classes in every section of PvP.
---
Probably less than 10% ever made it to the real endgame, but there are so many things to do before then everybody had fun.
---
Experience from kill follows a very simple formula and is incredibly easy to prove / disprove. 
---
The increased mobs on aoe farm however that is a very valid concern. I have no actually seen any tests on how many mobs can be killed within the aoe farm area's on the beta compared to vanilla.
---
You can start playing in phase 2 when there is no layering
---
Human mage?
---
Same. Basically every time I came up with a new, cool name that I wanted to give a character.
---
Write-in vote for very shortly post-vanilla content: the cave in the northwest corner of Blade's Edge Mountains back at the start of BC. If you died up there you pretty much had to do a full circuit of the entire zone. This came with all the usual difficulties of dying in a cave area, too.

---
where are you guys getting these information from? i leveled a horde and alliance warrior to 60 in vanilla. general consensus on warrior forums on bnet was fury for leveling. especially pre 40. you can 2h just fine but rage gen was always the issue.
---
i'm still scratching my head over this obsession with spirit in this sub. very rare i was out of combat for 5 seconds when grinding. even though it wasn't easy to level a warrior, you're not struggling that bad once you get at least all greens.
---
Let me tell you my story about sitting in log in queue for 4 hours every night and not being able to play the game at all. Those were good times.
---
If you're not in a particular hurry to get to 60, I say start with warrior and once you get to higher levels start leveling your hunter so you can accumulate rest XP on the warrior. It really is a slog for warrior compared to so many other classes and the rest XP could really help. Getting a head start on the gold necessary to gear a warrior would probably be helpful.
---
Always start with the main is my advice, particularly if you would like to tank raids.
---
Oh yeah, you're right :(
---
Fucking lol.  You are either a troll or dumb as a rock, but alright I'll bite.  "Nobody calls it DM" means "Statistically, the vast minority of the people who play the game do not refer to it as DM."
---
I don't see it being any different from the reasons we went into Gnomergan, we aren't sent in on behalf of our faction but as freelance mercenaries to acquire something for the pirates.
---
sorry i don't speak SQL database
---
Vanilla didn’t have 15k players per server. Ty.
---
I've provided what I actually want numerous times. And by the way, it isn't even my idea.
---
I'm tired of people like you who genuinely lack the imagination to think of anything besides layering, you know, the solution Blizzard suggested. Stop blindly defending them, Blizzard isn't going to pat you on the back.
---
Blizzard, please stop tempting me to roll a Tauren enhancement shaman instead of a mage... it's just cruel :&lt;
---
Sorry but I find it shit that even if I react faster than someone it doesn't matter because both spells will get through.
---
It was still an epic line, I didn't even notice it. The whole setup was perfect. He is just a human, and humans make mistakes when they speak, especially if they are excited.
---
Well in order to get most efficient honor farm you want to kill fairly high lvl players that don't do much in resisting your ganks. Devilsaur farmers are probably not the best thing to farm honor on since they will naturally be very well prepared for pvp since that is a requirement for them to be able to farm. But the area will be very populated, you can farm a bit of gold while doing the honor killing and there's plenty of lowlvls to kill, ungoro is like 49-53 which is a bit on the low side, but still decent honor.
---
A spriests main weakness is their mana though. And it just costs way to much. You essentially have to use inner focus every time with it.
---
It automatically squelches you after x amount of reports (IIRC, it was around 10 within a fairly short time frame). Squelching means you can only speak to your friends and your guild. The squelch lasts until a GM can review the reports. This can take hours or even days, which would be debilitating in Classic.
---
NOTE that squelching is not the same thing as a silence.  A _silence_ is a punishment that a GM can impose upon you _after_ reviewing your case; silences start at 24 hours and _double_ every time it is imposed on your account with no cap.  A _squelch_ is similar to a silence, but is not controlled by a GM and lasts until a GM can review the reports made against you.  It's supposedly there to prevent situations from "escalating further."
---
Aside from the obvious avenues for guilds and such to abuse this feature, it doesn't even need to be a concerted effort-- if you say something controversial ("I like retail WoW better than Classic" or something as innocuous-yet-contextually-inflammatory like that) in a reasonably populated area like the Barrens, there's a very good chance that a bunch of random people will respond by reporting you and you'll get squelched. That'll make it impossible to ask for help, get groups, etc. until a GM reviews it.
---
Furthermore, because the rules on trolling and harassment are so subjective and nebulous, it's unlikely that anyone would get punished for reporting you unless it was very obviously a directed attack. This means there's little in the way of a deterrent to prevent people from essentially abusing the feature, unwittingly or otherwise.
---
"Why not remove the auto-squelch function and leave RCR then?" you might ask.  Without automation, what purpose does the system serve, except to make it easier to report someone? None.  I'd argue that making it too easy to report someone is a _bad_ thing. It likely creates a lot of frivolous, unnecessary work for what is very probably going to be a skeleton GM crew to sift through.
---
Many people have been suggesting alternatives for nearly a year now. I'm sure you can find them with a bit of searching.
---
I normally don't really do this, but i just thought this was pure gold, haha ^^
---
Went elemental shaman in vanilla and always mained it.  Can’t decide between rogue or mage.  Will be primarily PVE but will also do some BG and world PVP.  Any input from anyone who played them in beta or main in vanilla?  Thanks
---
You are the perfect example of an ignorant person, that talks about something without knowing what that something is.
---
Layering PRIMARY REASON is to ensure a proper server LOAD during launch period...AND a healthy realm population AFTER launch period.
---
Mob tagging will be HORRENDOUS, with or WITHOUT layering.
---
However, WITHOUT layering, you will end up with dead realms. LOTS of them.
---
I am sorry, but you should maybe, MAYBE, inform yourself before talking about something.
---
You can stealth which means you can access bosses behind loads of trash without much issue (princess in Mara for example). You also have some OK AoE abilities, like hurricane and bear swipe. Druids should be mostly ok.
---
I did read it? My point is that can you trigger this the second you login ie by killing the most mob you see or do you need to change layer and then gain xp for it to happen.
---
"I assume that the cooldown starts after you jump layer" Its still been tested and no exact requirements have been laid out yet
---
800k gold? Or $$$?
---
Because, well...there is a difference.
---
This is a step in the right direction but believe me we will still complain about layering and layer hops.
---
&gt; never bother with spirit as a warrior.    
---
Well argued... Wait...    
---
1 Spirit = 3.4 HP/S standing, 4.52 HP/S sitting.     
---
A lot of items (e.g. gloves) before level 15 have 2 Spirit on them. If you wait three 2x second ticks between mobs (6 seconds total), that means a 40 HP higher restoration rate from that item alone. Considering health pool size, that's pretty significant.
---
It most likely triggers only when you gain xp or do any of those other actions while on a layer other than your original layer. Otherwise, you would almost never be able to leave your layer.
---
Only one I got is horde side orgrimmar to Tanaris, go make a sandwich it takes forever.
---
Going dual wield probably isn't a whole lot slower, but the way 2h interacts with instant hits is going to make it superior--especially with hamstring kiting as you'll be spending more time outside of the enemy's hit range in between swings. 
---
I'm skeptical of using demo shout being worth it (not to mention the wasted talent points). You can avoid more damage hamstring kiting.
---
I've been seeing rumblings about stacking spirit lately. I think I'd still aim for +dps/+hp over spirit. Ending encounters faster and being able to survive them is top priority. Utilizing first aid between mobs can keep you topped off pretty well.
---
I understand the feel of dual wield being more appealing and missing one or two swings with a 2-hander is brutal--ultimately, play the way you want. The fastest levelers are mostly going to be people that grind it out the hardest no matter how they do it.
---
Yes!
---
Cheers man
---
Can any1 give me a rundown on what I get from these rep(vondor)s/why I should farm them? I know a few but not all.
---
That sucks man. Brain injuries are no reason to be a douche. Also, I would have gquit the moment I had to tolerate a bigot officer.
---
Buttstallion
---
Undead is the strongest 1v1 race since devouring plague is auto win if they cant remove it. Troll is surprisingly strong with shadow guard and instant cast ranged mortal strike effect
---
I've read a lot of alternatives, and all have worse drawbacks than layering. 
---
The only thing I'd love to see is some kind of cooldown (Got'em) regarding switching layers.
---
Yeah -- even though the mage would be the alt and the warrior would be the main, I imagine the mage would be driving the leveling process.
---
I enjoy these underleveled dungeon runs. It’s kind of like if Vanilla has TBC Heroics. It’s also kind of good seeing people get their faces smashed after the 1-30 dungeons got cleaved so easily. 
---
It also seems like the dungeons get way harder as you level up. On private servers, it feels very consistent from Deadmines to LBRS in terms of damage, health, and how the mobs relate to your toon’s capabilities. Meanwhile, it feels like there’s a pretty stiff spike in difficulty around 35 and up on beta. Hopefully places like Scholo, Strath, LBRS, and DM need CC and careful execution.
---
I guess it's only fair I give some of mine. Probably making a Dwarf named Holymoly. Always wanted the name Murderface. And if I were making an undead warrior he would 100%be named Bonesaw.
---
Yeah but rerelesing say, BC and Wrath (pre Cataclysm, "Old WoW" content) would be dumb if it wasn't how the classes/talents existed back then.
---
I love Vanilla and am hyped for Classic, but I'd go absolutely wild for a BC rerelease on the new Classic engine and I'd be pissed if they just decided to change the classes from how they were in BC and keeping them how they were in Vanilla.  Or imagine a world where we get a Wrath rerelease and they decided not to add Death Knight's.  Even if you don't like them because they aren't in Vanilla, it would be stupid not to have them in Wrath.

Aq with 2.5 tier is when shockadin becomes strong
---
You may be inb4 it but that claim is correct. This is a direct response to community feedback. Just like a beta is supposed to work.
---
It's not one or the other. This dilemma is completely avoided by split server solution which is very similar to layering except you essentially choose your layer from the beginning and you have no way to change layer(and then eventually all these layers are merged together). This way you will consistently play with the same players throughout the entire layering time, but avoid queues or dead servers.
---
&gt;what's the purpose of new mid-level content? 
---
Reputation.
---
There will be probably an additive CD on repeated layer hopping on a specific time frame.
---
Actually, I am 100% that there will be an additive CD on repeated layer hoping in a specific time frame.
---
Fuck you
---
Depends on where you're at with raiding. Just entering raids midegation&gt;threat.
---
Once you and your raid gets more gear then threat gen starts being more priority
---
You macro them. Both on the same CD.
---
They dont show layer numbers next to peoples names as far as I can tell, however if I had to guess this would be an easy thing to fix by having one general chat.
---
NE forms suck, they’re so boring 👎 plus being on alliance means you have to play with gnomes 🤮
---
Not really lorewise, but its still a fun experience.
---
I am not an expert in 30-60, I haven't done it enough... or at all, on true vanilla servers. 
---
But 1-30? it's not even close. 
---
Prior to 20, rend is YOUR THING. It is, by miles, your most efficient rage dump, and the only time it's not worth using is when the mob will die in under 6 seconds. It also lets you bandage while a mob is death sentenced but you are still in combat, so rending low health mobs is a great health generator. 
---
Cruelty would be very nice, but I think improved rend is more total damage. As in, "last time I argued on reddit about the math, I concluded improved rend is on average more damage.
---
Next, we look at tier 2: unbridled wrath is near useless.  Typical 2h fury is going to be giving you 0.4 rage every 3 seconds, best case. for all 5 points. 
---
The SINGLE point in anger management is 0.33 rage per second. It's more efficient, in terms of rage, to take all 5 in tactical mastery and then take anger management, and then never use tactical mastery at all, than it is to take unbridled wrath.
---
So 10-20, it's not even close. 
---
So what about 20-30. 20-30, IMHO, is about spamming cleave. That's what you do. You get a big slow 2 hander to make cleave as rage efficient as possible, and then you spam cleave because it's now, by miles, the second best rage dump you have (rend still beats it for reasonable levels of gearing around level 20). 
---
If you go arms, you have vastly more rage to spam cleave, you have deep wounds which goes very well with hitting multiple mobs and having a huge slow 2 hander for weapon damage, and you don't have to respec at 30 for sweeping strikes. You also, are just vastly more able to tank dungeons, as you actually have the rage generation without charging, whereas fury is still rage starved.
---
Yeah its been so long but 1.1 and 1.3 were the most fun. 1.6 was when I remember thinking the fun got neutered. 
---
DoD was awesome. Just camp and wait.
---
Sbeve
---
&gt; But at the same time giving one faction something and the other faction nothing is pretty weak.
---
It's just a mount you have to nolife for, if it was anything gearwise I'd agree.  I still think it's not bad and you don't need to give horde/alliance something for everything the other faction has.
---
I tried doing this with a rogue by swapping a dagger into my main hand for ambush and then swapping out for a slow sword for better sinister strike damage. It works but it’s clunky and honestly not worth it. And if you forget to swap you’re gonna have a bad time.
---
Just saying it's undoubtedly the largest game changing factor between the two choices.
---
Gotta catch em all!
---
&gt; This was when they started on the journey to pass every other guild
---
By cheating
---
Also a streamer who has leaked false  "insider" information about classic in the past and his family is currently involved in a 800k fraud case. 
---
Just sayin'
---
Why waste such a great name if you aren't gonna camp wetlands all day?!
---
"......is vanilla!" That "is" bothered me sorry.
---
I'm not sure I understand. If you've been questing on one layer for let's say an hour, you haven't changed layers at all, so joining a friend on another layer should work just fine at that point.
---
However if say after 10 mins of questing with that friend you want to go to a different layer again, I assume at that point is when you'd get stuck due to the XP-prompted cooldown. That makes sense.
---
Surprised AQ is not on here.  A wipe on Twins or C'thun was a hike.  Not ghost the whole time but that was the worst run back imo.
---
What am I looking at here other than a lot of people
---
If I had to guess the internal cooldown isnt going to be THAT long, at most maybe 30 seconds.  So if you dont change layers then just stay out of combat for 30 seconds and good to go(pure conjecture here).
---
Aye, i seem to remember the number of summat like 11% horde population at one point. A lot of the guys I played with re-rolled horde at the end of Vanilla after the inevitable PvE crash before the expansion. Xark my ex-gm was one of the ones that joined Turncoats I believe.
---
Did some private server-ing, wasn't feeling it. Been on free FF14 for about a week now, that's a damn good MMO imo!
---
I can’t beat Bloodvenom Post in Felwood, but I think virtually anywhere in Ashenvale sucks. No matter where you die, it’s about a 4-7 minute runback, and it’s not a straight shot that you can auto run and do your... err, ret Pally rotation on Mozilla while you wait. There’s so many cliffs you can fall off and take 5 minutes to get back up.
---
Don’t get me started on Blackfathom Deeps. It’s not the worst, but every time I wipe there, 1 or 2 people choose to go *around* the mountain range and end up taking an extra 3 minutes per runback. And no matter how much I tell them there’s a faster way, there’s always one that doesn’t listen.
---
You literally said the exact thing in the last thread you replied to me. Until you provide something meaningful, not "I've explained myself before so now I'm just going to complain about Blizzard in every single post" then I'm just going to assume you're a troll. You don't know what you want except that you won't be happy regardless of what happens.
---
Damn y'all so hard on classic wows dick u can't take it
---
I’m getting my information from 15 years of playing experience. I can’t speak for the others.  
---
I mean any spec can work, Fury, Arms, even Prot. But Arms is the most optimal pre 40. People THINK Fury is because you used to be able to /sit spam to procc enrage and blood craze. This does not work and really hasn’t worked for a very long time.  
---
Arms has all of the +dmg dealing talents, imp rend, imp charge for rage, deep wounds, impale, imp OP (best), +crit (equal with fury).  
---
Yes, you will level just fine as Fury, it’s just the straight data of Arms is better for sub 40 dmg and leveling.
---
They can't ride UD and Troll mounts, so it's easy to think they cant ride Orc mounts
---
Stormscale EU gave me this.
---
Don't forget about 2h with hamstring kiting...
---
Way more people are going to take mining/engineering this time around tho, there will be less of every other profession I would imagine.
---
Whoa when did WoW turn into personal loot?
---
I'm not arguing the merits of digital over film. But in 2005 we knew how to take screenshots.
---
My group of friends is going horde for the first time due to 1-2 friends playing shaman. I’m sure the same happens for friend groups with paladins. 
---
You’ll probably have more “INVIT TO ASMON LAYER” if you go alliance. I think streamers will impact the factions more than anything else with regards to faction communities, unfortunately.
---
I decided to try it out just to see what the hype was about since spirit gear is pretty cheap and it made me want to grab an add-on to quickly swap gear sets between fights.  I also put /sit on my action bar after a while.  Most of the time I lose to ganks anyways though so that part doesn't affect me much.  I'd recommend if you got a few gold to grab a bunch of spirit gear and look at the difference just to see if you'd like it.
---
I still gotta try out stacking up agi gear for the crit and see how well that feels
---
Yes this I believe is what he meant because that's the only thing that makes sense.
---
You can turn in stacks of cloth for rep. Rune cloth is the only repeatable ,this process is not efficient
---
Won't layering mean you will have to do that even more? Only instead of for phase 1 just phase 2 3 4 5 and 6?
---
If layering allows more people to play on a server, on different layers, then a server could easily gain a population of over 15 thousand people. And one layering is removed in phase 2, all those people will be queuing to get on a single 3k pop server.
---
And you may say that player levels will die down after launch, and it will, but there will also be many players trickling in throughout phase 1. And then when a new phase drops and there's new content to be played, population will surge like mad and we will all be in huge queues.
---
Only if they adopt the ex husband and start calling him son
---
That's the point though. 20/31/0 stays up and warlocks for much longer than SM/Ruin. The only thing SM/Ruin does better is blow people to pieces with ruin and +6 range for shadow bolts. With felheart having bricks of stam, but low spell damage and crit, SL is better than SM/ruin for bgs early on. If you really want to compare the dots, having SM instead of SL gives you like 8 dps on corruption and siphon life which isn't even worth dispelling at that point.
---
DoTs have really bad coefficients in vanilla while soul fire, immolate, conflag and shadowbolt, NS proc shadowbolt, shadowburn crit sequences start erasing full health geared people. You can't expect that to happen with 10% crit from MC gear.
---
Warcraft 3
---
Why is character creation separate?
---
So it's only usuable once every 3 mins. And only if you think it's the right time to use it. What if you put it on someone and then a warrior zooms in and they get killed in 8 secs. Two 3 min cds were wasted
---
i dont think he was saying it was a big deal, rather than its enough time for it to be inefficient to abuse layer hopping
---
Layering is an entire copy of the world.  Not specific zones, that is what sharding is, and that is why retail feels so disconnected (combined with multi-realms).
---
druid isnt good at healing as well\^\^
---
Who else remembers the hype when there are two separate 100 rolls?  Vent explodes
---
is there any benefit with gaining rep with factions apart from your own race? I know the winterspring one gets you a unique saber mount color.
---
There are numerous articles from way back how server mergers ruin communities, economies, and overall experience. 
---
I yet to see anyone suggesting Multi server solution provide any cons.... it is like a silver bullet.
---
Dungeons in retail are always personal loot. Mythic + too. Raids CAN be used as masterloot, but you get as much gear with Personal loot so it's kinda meh.
---
I think it was introduced in Legion iirc. Or WoD. Probably Legion.
---
Remember that release is two months away, but the layering problem has been like this since beta was first released.  Not surprising that people are getting scared of potentially seeing it put into release.
---
And need I remind you layering is what started hurting retail and why a lot of people don't even want to see it touch classic.  The community will accept it for the first few weeks of release only in initial leveling zones but anything past that risks ruining the game and the community.
---
I cannot begin to explain to someone how important it is to be able to see your current servers players from level 1-10 leveling and you right next to them only to part ways in the Barrens and then randomly meet up again a few zones later and strike up a random conversation simply because those two players did a quest together against a strong elite.
---
It could all change if Classic overtakes BfA / (Future exp) in popularity / players.
---
Every night?  For the entirety of Vanilla?  You sat all 4 hours?
---
Or
---
Did you log in week 1, see a 4 hour queue, then exit the game?

Of course the queue is never actually as long as it says.  And we all know the queues didn't last much longer than release....  So yeah.  I'd bet #2 is the case.
---
All the flavours you can be and you choose salty........It is 15 years ago and the little bit that was done was all but erased come Naxx when we left everyone in the dust. Wait thinking back, didn't TR wall glitch so they could get AQ40 Regalia turned in.......And PS it is not cheating until you get caught....and we were never caught.
---
That's not how layering works, you are asking for sharding back.
---
On the flipside, it also means getting geared slower, since there's 8 of you per raid.
---
&gt; holy crap
---
I think the issue is they were shadow
---
I don't get the people saying it'll get stale if nothing changes, yet we've had private 1.12 servers for 14 years now.
---
If the content was going to die from lack of new content, it'd be dead by now.  Fuck, Diablo 2 is older than WoW and it has a more active playerbase than Diablo 3 does, content literally hasn't changed in 18 years.
---
All that never adding content to Classic means is more time and reason to level and gear alts that you never otherwise would have.  Oh your tank is BiS Naxx geared?  Try a DPS or healer now.
---
Maybe I will ;)
---
Yeah man. People are not going nuts on pre-bis for MC. That place is a joke. Most probably intend to do 5/10 mans on off raid nights, but who would over prepare for a cake walk. People got RL and farming shit to do
---
Difference between criticizing design and being a whiny bitch who also attacks the developers instead of the content.
---
Here on Reddit, we're all super pro expert developers and software architects that are better than any company could imagine. How did they ever survive before we were hear to yell at them?
---
Haha, first time playing on an english server people in Westfall were looking for "VC"... because DM stands for Dire Maul...
---
How long *should it be?* The longer it is, the better it as combating abuse, but the more invasive it is to honest players.
---
I was always disappointed that Magram/Gelkis offered nothing worthwhile. I got so excited at that quest chain, i grinded to revered+ and spent the next 20-30 levels wondering when they would reappear.   
---
Argent Dawn though ... wow I love that faction. And some cool(ish) rewards!
---
...you confusing Blizzard with a company that is no longer around?
---
Or we can have no layering and we can all start playing day 2 when there's no queues?
---
Old RPPVP Guild called Bold as Lions on Emerald Dream. Was leveling an alt with a friend at the time when we got invited to it. The gm and a few officers turned out to be extremely racist and would bully other guilds. Someone stole their vent info and took control of the guild too because it was just gone one day. Either deleted or they all just left. 
---
The general story was that the bullied guilds got sick of their shit and hit back.
---
Leveled a warrior to 60 a mage to 60 and a paladin just before BC apparently i had no life lol
---
Resistance pots sell like hot cakes when a new tier is released.
---
&gt; It is an RPG game, your class isn't supposed to heal, **tank, and dps** 
---
Tell that to warriors who have god tier tank AND dps class. Man the dumb things can people say nowadays.
---
We need more "why I love X" content in this community, people are too tense. Glad to see more content of yours. You should do some on your favorite zones/dungeons/raids!
---
That's assuming you both start questing at the same time. If one of you is questing, and another logs on and wants to quest with the other but is in another layer, you can't and have to wait for the CD.
---
Absolutely this.
---
Group forms just fine, it might require some downtime to get to the same layer.  However we have no knowledge on if they will be doing different GCD for different things.  I could see killing mobs having a much lower cooldown than PVP for example.
---
Best advice I could ever give anyone in short and sweet manner would be to simply loot EVERYTHING (all greys) included and vendor them. This would be when questing or doing dungeons. 
---
A grey level 30 wep is worth over 25s in some cases and level 60 greys can be worth over 2g. 
---
That adds up quickly and getting a mount by 40 should not be an issue at all as well as level 60 training.
---
There was a glitch with uncooked devious fish and the party time debuff that would instantly teleport you to the landing point. I'd use it now and again to get to Tanaris from Org quickly.
---
Frost? I think he has a touch of the ‘tism.
---
Maybe it's ment to encourage finding people on the same layer?  Granted isn't /1 all layers so doesn't really help does it
---
:'( uhuhuhu
---
woah heated
---
Albion Online. Has a Diablo(solo) and Moba(group pvp) feel. However it's a MMO. I just solo tho, grind stuff and waste time. F2P technically. Once you get enough money you can perpetuate "premium" levels each month.
---
It sounds like the cooldown is triggered once you earn xp/ pick an herb on the new layer. That way you will remain on the new layer for a time before being able to transfer to another layer or back to the original one.
---
You know layering is basically a copy of the complete server?  It cant be zone specific unless you want them to go the sharding route.
---
When you perform an action on one layer (such as looting the Gurubashi chest) then get an invite from a friend on another layer to try and loot the same chest again.
---
Are you saying that classic will be lacking gold sinks?
---
I know what TBC/WOTLK was like and that's not what I am refering to.
---
No kidding.
---
I have to say, I think you're the first person to say NE forms suck.
---
I will give you that point about gnomes though....
---
Are you tired of winning yet?
---
Never said on Launch, I just remember rolling on a popular server back in Vanilla because of my friends, before Blizz started locking new character creation down. I ended up not playing for a like 6 month because I simply was not able to log in and enjoy the game. It would take hours to get in.  
---
If they screw up the launch it could be WAY more damaging to the game then layer hopping and other exploits.
---
Oh that's good to know. I tried it, I can't remember if I tried it on a pserver or on Beta but if it doesn't need movement speed I'll definitely add it to the route!
---
What's frustrating about this community is how many people saw the problems with layering and immediately decided that the whole system had to be scrapped entirely. The solutions were hilariously obvious but no, let's instead risk a disastrous launch by demanding no layering.
---
That wouldn't make sense. That way, you'd get one free pass to abuse the layering mechanism before a cooldown is in effect.
---
Thanks! I love suggestions, I just might add those ideas to the list.
---
Absolutely refuse to do this and dont think I ever have.
---
haha it's super easy for me to follow (And I built it for myself so that's the only person I really care about). If you or anyone else wanted to convert it into a json file they're more than happy. I've also been running this route so much it's mostly a reference for me at this point
---
Auto Mods are deleting a lot of posts on this sub reddit... is there a more appropriate place to post?
---
Druid Warrior is one of the best duo comps. While you lack a cleanse/freedom, you're also more mobile yourself than paladins/priests, and require less support from the warrior. You can root his target, cure poisons on him, Feral Charge/Stun his target, and can heal on the run. 
---
While leveling, you can pop out of cat and then toss a rejuv on you both and swap back, so you won't have to stop and drink as well.
---
ITT: "See, this is why there's a Beta, to fix things that are a problem. So stop bringing problems up."
---
Wat
---
my guilds first Eye of Sulferas went to a enh sham.  But the WF crit deaths where real, Threat dump = die and Ankh.
---
He also was part of the r14 farming group.
---
I was wondering if I'd see this get turned into a WoW/Classic post.
---
Hmm. Were you a human in your dream?
---
I wouldn’t think you’d even need 10m.  Just needs to be long enough that folks can’t farm.  So if the respawn on an herb is 5 minutes, make it about 5 minutes so that a person can’t get more herbs than intended by jumping layers.  
---
I do like having the CD triggered by interactions with the world. This would keep people from phasing out in combat/grabbing an herb and then immediately layering over.  
---
But tbh, people likely won’t be spending a ton of time jumping layers.  If the reason people want to be able to jump layers is to be either their friends, how many layer jumps will it take to accomplish this? With a 5m CD, shouldn’t everyone be able to get on the same page within 5m? 
---
I’d rather wait 5m for a layer hop to group with friends than wait 5 hours for the 600 person long queue for some story quest mob that only spawns every 5 minutes and has the entire zone sitting at its spawn.
---
If devouring plague was cut in half across the board I would definetly say it's better. 500 dmg/500 mana and a 1.5 min CD. I would use that spell all time and it would seem much more useful. I personally have trouble using cds cause I always tell myself "you dont need it now, what if you need it later" so for it's long CD and high mana cost I would end up never using it. But shadowguard I would use multiple times every fight
---
Think its super cool, but Alliance only?
---
my buddy and I are going to be leveling together with the idea of focusing on pvp for the most part, we're going to be playing a Sham/war combo.  I guess this might be the wrong place to post about this but I've never played WoW before really ( tons of other MMOs) and I think I'm going to play the resto sham but he said it's my choice , so just any advice, weaknesses I should be aware of/ keep in mind and strengths to focus on. I read something about doing enh sham to 60 then respecing to resto will reset some stuff that you'll have to re level? Not actually sure I didn't understand the jargon. Thanks a head of time!
---
That's the point. This was all in one layer
---
Interesting but how do you read it?
---
Unless you're trying to repeatedly layer hop in short succession, you won't ever see this issue. Remember it's a cooldown on switching, not a ban on switching. Most of the time you'll likely be totally fine.
---
1/10 troll, nice b8 tho.
---
No changes.
---
You could always join my guild ;) it’s horde and wanting some shammys
---
Cant wait to have 50 toons that aren't level 60! gonna be so much fun playing the classes in their former glory.
---
Where boys became men
---
LoL, TFT, CS:GO, and PUBG
---
Just hopped on Dota Underlords, new auto-chess game. It's actually quite fun.
---
That would stink, but also make sense huh.
---
Didn't even really think of that tbh.
---
The French make up 4% of the EU playerbase and you want to give them 3 realms? Just no. Blizzard is never going to do that. There simply won’t be enough people playing.
---
That's our culture anymore. We have to react with mania to literally everything.
---
Blizzard bad? I thought only Activision and EA bad? Anyways, praise Geraldo!
---
oh np, but i will be the one making the group so no problem here, "reserve" ppl wont join my run
---
the last few expansions were smooth on launch day IIRC
---
Agreed on the confidence life, but I'm torn on this one:
---
&gt; especially when they see when they are getting an upgrade. 
---
I can see how it would be good motivation to attend a raid, if you know that you've got something coming, but for each person who knows what they will get, that means several more people know that *they will not* get that loot. It seems like you'd create the problem you have in a DKP system where people with large sums of DKP don't show up except for raids that drop gear that they need. Couldn't this end up hurting attendance?
---
Currently at Tech School in the USAF working like 60hrs a week studying, marching, doing parade and other stuff so my time is pretty much fully occupied until Classic is released.
---
For our sake let's assume classic does very well. The way I see it, Blizzard has two options. TBC or Classic+. Doing nothing just isn't an option (assuming classic does well). TBC seems like the obvious, safe choice. If classic does well, TBC servers will do well. It's debatable if they'll do AS well, but they'll do well nonetheless. Classic+ has the potential to be revolutionary, but it also has the potential to totally flop. I'm torn with which I would prefer...
---
No they aren't forgetting, its almost always mentioned.
---
I think you meant to say Darnassus?
---
It's a cooldown on *switching*. If you've been questing for an hour, you haven't switched layers. If you group with someone at that point, then you switch layers, and once you start gaining XP *after* the switch, that's when your new CD starts. 
---
I imagine if you log in fresh and kill a mob, you'd start a CD that way as well. So you'd be banned from switching layers for a bit if you did that.
---
in the last 20 mins of the game (before they spawned onyxia whelps to attack us) they merged all layers on the realm into 1. So this is a combination of every layer on the server merged.
---
Lol no armory link... ofc not..
---
Afaik they never mentioned right klick reporting to be in the game.
---
Nice one for calling Deadmines 'Dm'
---
&gt;There are numerous articles from way back how server mergers ruin communities, economies, and overall experience
---
They don't.  This is a vocal minority opinion, mostly people pissed they had to name change.  I have been through a server merge and honestly the influx of new people was fun, and it didn't destroy existing bonds... Why would it?  That doesn't even make sense logically or in practice.
---
Also people have already solved the name change issue.
---
Outcry pointing out problems with the system was always fine by most people. There of course will always be the people who hate any kind of negativity, constructive or otherwise, but most people who supported layering in the past have always said there needs to be big fixing to prevent abuse. On the other hand, many people in the anti layering camp have said even with big fixes they didn't wait it because they wanted 100% pure vanilla. Every single post on layering bugs they would show up like the OOGA gang and demand it be removed immediately without condition. That's not constructive criticism, that's being a man baby. Between those two groups were what I'm guessing was the majority of people that wanted changes to layering to mitigate the impact, like limiting it to 10, 20, etc. That at least had solutions, although they didn't completely address the problem, were at least in good spirit. 
---
But even if blizzard fixes every single big with layering (they won't, nothing is ever 100% bug free in games) the #nochanges crowd will still beat their collective chest about the issue until launch day and then presumably get over it and play or start demanding true vanilla servers. Either way, doesn't bother me, I'm glad blizzard is making an effort to fix the system
---
You don't seem to be following what we're talking about. What exactly do you think this conversation is about?
---
Stop reposting this for Karma. It's bad.
---
So Rag will be dropped 666 days after the announcement?
---
agreed
---
gotcha. my first char was a warrior in 2004 and i quit after TBC so i didn't keep track of all the warrior changes. never did any of that /spit enrage nonsense. got 2 to 60 pre TBC and a bunch of others after that. i just formed dungeon groups after i was high level enough (i think even as low as 12 for RFC) so i just farmed those to get gear. gonna follow that same plan. biggest challenge for a warrior is rage generation so that's why i always recommend fury.
---
The worst situation I guess will be for RP servers. I never played myself on such kind of servers but as far as I can imagine, communication between players is even mote important than on other types of servers.
---
I just can't imagine people trying to RP talk, using google translate to try and make themselves understood from other EU players, too bad for the immersion...
---
For sure some non official language-preferred servers will exist, and lot of people will suffer from this situation.
---
Really, blizzard has to change their minds!
---
Even if some servers end up being too empty after some time,  merging them into a healthier server should still be feasible to "save" them!
---
This^^
---
Hahahaha.
---
Yes there is a risk of some servers being overpopulated but same can be said about Illidan 1, 2, 3 solution when they start merging them and the pop is too high. 
---
At least with layering they can restrict new character creation once they see a big chunk of population is actually staying on the particular server and getting to 60. 
---
With Illidan 1, 2, 3 solution you can't limit character creation on one server just because the other two a filling up.
---
Sounds like you're never getting invited to a raid team. If you even make it to 60, that is.
---
&gt; It took me personally over 500 hours on a single character to hit 60
---
Don't even pretend that that's not an outlier. It didn't take 500 hours to hit 60 even if you were going at a leisurely pace.
---
Next iq lvl 9999 move:
---
Go on the auto assigned one.
---
If you end up on a full server heres the ultimate iq move not even einstein did,:
---
Just change server aslong as youre lower than lvl 30..
---
Or just cry 24/7 about not being able to play, i wouldnt care but now we got layering thanks to genius players not even thinking for one sec.
---
Might also have layers because its cheaper for blizzard but who knows.
---
Eh, not always. As shaman you can pick up certain leather and cloth pieces (you're not as restricted a priest or druid). Additionally, many guilds will have prios that tend to logically distribute gear; ie they might allocate pieces to spread out 3-piece bonuses sooner, or might tell certain shaman to pursue t2 or offset pieces while prio-ing other t2.5, with the idea the non 2.5 shaman will get first 3-piece Naxx prio, etc.
---
Gearing a shaman (or any healing class really) to respectable levels is nowhere near as difficult as gearing up your melee or even casters
---
How about those of us who have a job, kids and other responsibilities? I only have a maximum of two hours to play per night, and I would prefer to actually get in the game.
---
Part of the argument against layering is people wanting to be celebrities on their realm forums and their little egos can't handle just blending into the pack and just leveling.  You know the type. Back then they posted incessantly about the world PvP they just had, claimed they were the best, and treated themselves as though having some type of server clout gave them a life's purpose. Those people are easily the loudest of the bunch crying about layering instead of just playing the game.
---
We're so excited for Classic :D
---
Why do you think that?
---
Well that's the problem. They are International Servers, not English Servers.
---
The UK people have the exact same problem and are already looking into going to the US Servers.
---
There is a huge difference between everyone being able to talk and communicate in English and International Servers.
---
You could get stuck on a dominating Spanish server, without knowing.
---
What then?
---
The Russians also don't like the situation, the guys I have seen so far said, that the Russian community isn't that big, so they could potentially be stuck on empty servers.
---
So language Servers for everyone and free the Russians!
---
Since its temporary I'd rather have it be a little too much than too little. After the first week or two it shouldn't be necessary anyways..
---
You write like a crazy person.
---
With less then 20 won arenagames you get your first gladiator weapon aswell... addon is one big joke.
---
Nah man, bis caster gloves until ebony flame and t2 gloves(rarest slot), healing neck bis until aq, bis warlock offhand until aq, healing mace is strong until lokamir/claw/benediction.

Bis caster cloak until cthun, bis holy pally gloves until cthun, bis hunter mh and offhand until aq. Caster ring combo bis until both drake ring and spell power from mc, bis all game evocate staff, healer ring combo bis until nef ring.
---
Zg has a lot of good gear
---
On the beginning of BfA, I rolled a Priest thinking it would be a very fun class to play. But at the level cap, I found it to be a pretty hard class to play and heal with. I've played classic and a bit of nearly every expansion. Are priests as hard to play in classic as they are now, or are they pretty straight forward, like most classes?
---
You can't overpower a miss, jeez bro.
---
It would also put you on cooldown damn near the second you login in most cases. You login, walk out of an inn and discover a new area you now can't group with your friends for X amount of time. This wouldn't be to bad if the CD was very short.
---
If they change layering so that it becomes legitimately harder to group with your Friends then it'd have been better to leave as it is, thats why I hope the CD doesn't trigger unless you've alreadt changed layer
---
Ive only been here a day I don't know what a layer is. All I know is a lot of people hate it and others dont hate it.
---
Looks fun but laggy
---
That isn't how it works. Blizzard's layering system is continent wide. It isn't made for per-zone. It would likely take several months to customize it for every zone.
---
It's either layering is in or layering is out, it isn't as simple as startign zones only.
---
I always thought it'd be cool if they reworked Outlands to be usable without flying mounts. Then they can remove flying mounts and for the most part it'd be relatively the same. I think it'd help keep the world feeling like Vanilla.
---
There's no reason to get so angry, wow.
---
&gt; Love those sexy curves and those sexy heals
---
I feel like "high heals" would have been pretty effective here.
---
Rest xp is a great reason to switch off between main and alt while leveling, thanks!
---
I'm usually focused on one character, and barely notice or care about rest xp.
---
$2000? For this one static image? You're out of your fucking mind lol
---
Of course people are now complaining that they can't layer hop as easily???
---
You must have been a warrior?
---
Day 2 will have queues
---
They said previously that guildmates will automatically be put in the same layers so this shouldn't be an issue. You'll always be in the same layer to start with. And if someone isn't in guild, just invite them to group when they log in so they get put in your layer.
---
The game forces you to make new friends.
---
TBC was a cool expansion, and I would have to say it really improved areas, the raids were refined more, the dungeons etc. Arenas were a cool addition, the ideas for crafting proffesions, cleaner quest hubs.
---
However I do believe TBC servers will cause either a lot of people to split into Classic/TBC/Retail and Eventually WotLK. Personally I would prefer they do Classic as a lore spin off as a "What would happen if we went back in time(CoT style), and buried the dark portal Stargate style" .
---
I am so torn between playing a dwarf holy pally or holy priest. I plan on both pve and pvping a lot and would definitely like to heal. I feel as a clothie I will get destroyed in pvp, is this the case? I will also be leveling with my buddy who will be playing a hunter. I very much prefer to play priest but don't want to regret not having plate in pvp, but at the same time I feel fear ward is a guaranteed spot in most groups. Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks :)
---
Wouldn't the one just logging on not be able to switch layers instantly? Since he just logged in and doesn't have cd
---
Less than a week ago people were saying Classic is gonna be shit, private servers got it right (despite the fact those who have played private servers and Classic say even if you released Classic today, it has far less bugs than private servers and is better)
---
Legit saw a ton of highly upvoted posts "back to the private servers we go" lmao
---
Better at healing than dps! Unfortunately druids are in a tight place in vanilla.
---
Calm down my man I’m actually in tech. The customer has to tell the systems engineers and software developers what they want! There are constant meetings and updates/progress reports along the way. The customer doesn’t just set a finish date and wait expecting a perfect product with no progress reports in between! In this case we are the customer and the progress reports are a back and forth between the best solution for classic tourists that doesn’t break the spirit of classic. If the community didn’t expose the exploits they wouldn’t have built this solution. Trust the process.
---
You're better off as enhancement for leveling. You'll spec into 2h weapons, and iirc you'll lose the skill level of 2h weapons one you respec.  So going back to enhancement at any point you'll have to re-level the 2h axe and mace skill. But for the most part you'll probably just want to stay as an elemental/resto spec for pvp burst, and you can still heal raids in this spec as long as the guild is okay with you not having mana tide.
---
It's pretty simple. He's included every race/class combo. The ones at the top he thinks are the best. The ones at the bottom are the "worst".

---
huges souls fan also.  I could pick up my on my Sekiro game again, but i just didn't enjoy it as much as souls.
---
Replaying Dark Souls 1 though...now there's a thought.  It's been a few years.
---
Why are you group hopping so much anyway? This just seems like such an unlikely concern.
---
Hi muted,
---
Shaman/Warrior is a really strong combo. Early in the game, leveling as resto can be a bit difficult due to low  damage output, but this would be offset by grouping with your friend. Generally it is recommended to level as enhancement. (Each time you level up, you get a “Talent Point” that you can choose.) It is recommended because during the leveling process, you can still heal fine and don’t need to be resto specced. At max lvl, you can respec (reset your talent points, then pick different ones). Don’t worry, you don’t have to re-level anything. When you reset talent points, they are all refunded to you and you can just pick new ones.
---
Have fun in classic!!
---
LMFAO
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
I hope to avoid streamer servers, hopefully it won't be a consideration past that.
---
Idk, has a good humorous feel to it. 9/10.
---
i think in a perfect world this would be a good system but i would worry about lets say im a day late to the party and my friend got to illidan #2 but now thats full when i finally get to play and im stuck on illidan #3 until they merged them, personally id be fine with this but im sure other people wouldnt be happy, layering atleast takes care of that problem :/
---
VC is for psychotic people
---
That's what I'm leaning towards tbh. For QoL.
---
Do you expect people to actually understand what they're complaining about?
---
Too true
---
Free realm transf when a server is dead. Simple.
---
Perhaps I read the tweet wrong, but that wasn't the impression I got from his wording. It literally just lists things that prevent layer hopping. 
---
If it actually works that way, thats pretty great.
---
Man I've had 15 years and I STILL can't decide!
---
Thicc heals ftw
---
Bro, you have no idea lol.
---
If you were on Stress Test 15 and didn't play the moment it launched, it was actually unplayable until several hours later where they turned UP layering.
---
I couldn't get ANY quests done in Coldridge. None. I couldnt farm ANY mobs. I was legit just stuck at Level 2 unless I wanted to explore Azeroth for XP, which I didn't, I want to find stuff. But it was such a fucking shitshow that I couldn't even play the game.
---
That is NOT fun.
---
&gt;If they screw up the launch it could be WAY more damaging to the game then layer hopping and other exploits.
---
The game could be unplayable week 1 and it would still be MUCH less detrimental in the long term to completely destroying the idea of a cohesive world, which is what layering does.
---
It's tough because the critics post their criticisms against said company here on Reddit, needing people to see it and seeking their approval. Which is fine and normal. Then they get incredibly angry when people defend the company or critique the criticisms. It's not constructive. We just end up in a sub with people fighting each other instead of hanging out and excitedly talking about something cool.
---
Because its a game and you're meant to have fun in games. And you don't need the most optimal raid composition to complete classic raids. 
---
I'm starting a guild with some friends around this sole purpose.
---
Thanks so much babe, best gift ever ;)
---
I seldomly see it in the opening line or debate. It's generally "Horde better, WOTF/Tremor bad". And then at some point later, paladins are referenced.
---
Not once have I seen the debate begin as a true comparison with paladins mentioned up front as a counterweight, or hell, even seen the debate begin in the opposite direction ("Alliance locks better! Spam cleanse pallys &gt; wotf cd")
---
I know it's edgy to shoot down "I never see" or "unpopular opinion" posts, but in this case I think you're reaching a bit much.
---
Astroneer
---
Ok thank you, I just thought there were different categories bg/wpvp/... as they are in the title
---
make sure to look at the spec symbols for each combo. Still kinda confused myself. Pretty neat nonetheless.
---
They should make it short but additive - nobody needs to hop layers 10 times in an hour that isn’t abusing the system.
---
Basically the "world" is divided into several simultaneously existing "layers". Rather than sharding which is zone-based I believe, layers extend across the entire continent. In this instance, Asmon ran this event and many, many people were able to get into the layer he was in through invites (when you get invited to a group, you join the invitees layer). 
---
It was very very laggy, but awesome nonetheless.
---
They’re just so boring to me, I like boomkin but who’s gonna use that in classic? Maybe it’s nostalgia but as a kid I thought a lion with horns was pretty much the coolest thing in the entire game lol, and bear is pretty much the exact same only 1 has horns which is cooler imo. I completely understand people not liking the bulky models tho, that’s why I’m going female
---
Seriously, how do people raid without being drunk. I can't do progression sober, wiping 60 times in a row is a fucking bitch for anyone, if it's not then they're lying.
---
People dont know what those are considering games fully release while in them now.
---
So what happens if you and your friend are on a different layer and invite each another at the same spot?
---
I mean, yeah, much of the stuff is definitely useful, but that sounds like 1-3/4 pieces per class. I hardly think it invalidates MC. 
---
Especially since your chances of getting every one of those items kinda slim.
---
So it is not he IDEAL solution since there are ppl complaining .... but who cares about the "vocal minority" that complains about laye.... I mean server mergers ..... you see what I did there. Please don't discredit others as a fringe group. 
---
Just like you with layering, they had their experiences "ruined" with server mergers.
---
edgy/10
---
And right before you wondered why your GF  was still at work that late? :D
---
There are definitely GYs that are alliance/horde only. I remember ganking the alliance camp in WPL. The alliance GYs is right next to it 50 yards away, but the horde one is in the Sepulcher in Tirisfal Glades a long walk away.
---
This also makes me believe it doesn't just choose the closest GY but that is is dependent on zone. In my example if you ran into Alterac Mountains and died just over the border you would go to Tarren Mill which is much closer.
---
You can't be exalted with either, these reputations cap at honored. You can get revered if you saved up quests.
---
Anyway, if you group with someone and they kill let's say Magram, you will gain rep with Gelkis but not lose rep with Magram. So if you wanted to you can get a friend or use a second account to get friendly or higher with both at the same time.
---
Or leave it and Rag will drop on 666
---
Feedback is great. I'm describing something else that happens \*after\* the feedback.
---
This is another good point and if we go by the original example of 9k server pop, 3k people per layer, you'd only have 3 layers.
---
Absolutely disagree. Beastmaster hunter with broken tooth can shutdown any caster with broken's 1 second attack speed. BM also had an on demand stun - intimidate. Who compiled this?
---
Or you know, get revenge on someone who ganked you. That is one thing I did a lot of, I would sometimes ambush an enemies enemy, move off and wave. Try to be cool, if they turned around and murdered me while I was killing mobs, my sole focus became ruining whatever they were doing. At least til 60...then I was just chilling looking for dungeons and stuff. My murderous bastard side really came out when I started playing a priest though, weird.
---
Yes!!

My favorite flavor vanilla.

Or.
---
My favorite flavor IS vanilla.
---
Based solely on the wording of the tweet, it sounds like you gain CD similar to a debuff that prevents you from layer hopping.
---
However, the way you're describing it makes way more for sense for how it should work, so I'm really hoping this is how it actually is.
---
I doubt the client can even handle Northshire with 3000+ people in it, let alone the server. Nevermind waiting possible days for a kobold tag. I don't think you're fully grasping the scale of the overpopulation. It's almost certainly going to be a bigger launch than retail vanilla, with less servers to account for eventual drop-off.
---
I'm still not a fan of any layering / sharding, but when I'm being realistic I can't imagine any feasible way around it for at least starting zones.
---
Its not too inaccurate by my experiences. My first was 12 or 13 days. My second was 8 or 9 days. It may have been 10 or so years since I played but I'm expecting to be sub 10 days again without huge effort and playing horse for the time.
---
You won't have to relevel anything when you respec, but some of your talents will be reset and you might need to rebind the abilities you learn from them or make sure you pick them up from a class trainer in the case of new abilities from new talents.
---
Strengths to focus on -- drop that windfury totem and keep your buddy up. Earthstock / earthbind totem kiting coupled with your buddy hamstringing could also seriously reduce the downtime for both of you.
---
You don't (and shouldn't) have to level resto to do a good job healing while leveling. Level enhance and help you buddy pew pee or cc while keeping him alive.
---
Shaman have some threat generating abilities and tend to do bursty damage (which generates a lot of threat) so just be aware of who has aggro. The more you can keep it on your buddy (while you heal him) or keep it off both of you with strategic kiting, the better.
---
Been playing dauntless its pretty fun monster hunter game me and a few mates are having a right laugh with it and also its building up our teamwork for dungeons when classic finally hits!
---
&gt; The decision is a lose - lose situation for the community
---
It's better than Blizzard giving in, making language specific servers, and then having to merge them all together because none of the servers have a sustainable population.
---
fresh
---
Well that is kinda their class fantasy lol
---
FOR THE HORDE.
---
There's no set date, it could be the entire first phase for all we know. Which might last for 3, 4 or maybe 5 months.. enough time for people to earn TONS of gold by abusing the layering system.
---
I think people are really overthinking this, as of right now Arms is the way to level. You use the highest DPS weapon until level 40 (when you get/respec into MS), 1her, staff, whatever ..highest dps weapon. Armor, same thing, whatever provides the most DPS, which is going to be your of the bear items most likely ..leather, mail, plate, whatever increases DPS. You're not going to have enough spirit to drastically improve your up time versus killing something faster.
---
It’s definitely 7. I had to look it up cause you had me questioning my identity, childhood, and entire reality.
---
for the horde !!
---
Or maybe Luciferon. Either one works.
---
You will still get competition on quest, as one layer will have the population of a vanilla server. Vanilla was not designed with population numbers of the private servers in mind, and the competition for quest will be a lot more authentic with layers than it is on massive private server launches.
---
If they added a cooldown to layer hopping it would be activated when you changed layers. Why is he talking about it being triggered by a bunch of other actions ? No one in their right mind would attach the cooldown to all the abusable things you can do rather than the action itself.
---
I don't like it, to be honest. I feel like as a warrior, I have plenty to do normally, usually looking for ganks or looking for other mobs that I do/don't  want to pull my mob into as I move across the zone. I don't want to tunnel vision on my current target.
---
In terms of dual wielding at 20-40, which is where you primarily diverge?
---
Do not delay tactical mastery. It is a complete game changer. It is worth taking all 5 points in tactical mastery and never using them just for the rage, and the ability to swap to defensive stance and still hamstring or intimidating shout is quite important for pulls gone bad.
---
But what do you spend the rage on? certainly not heroic strike. 
---
heroic strike at 24 is 40 damage. Cleave is 10+ your weapon damage, which at 24 is probably over 100 (3.5 speed weapon, and 30 total dps would be a bad number at 24. )
---
So cleave, for 25 rage (including the swing you forfeit) is going to be 110 damage and 2 deep wounds attempts, for 25 rage. Even on a horde character at 24 with no decent 2 hander, it's likely 100 damage.
---
Heroic strike, even talented, is going to be like 40 for 15? 
---
It's not close. priority goes as follows 
---
overpower ---&gt; rend if you can get half the ticks off ----&gt; cleave, with as much shouting and hamstringing as you need to make the rage and damage recieved work.  (and yes, rend really is that good even at level 20.) .
---
In this framework, a 1 hander is just massively less efficient in terms of damage per rage when combined with cleave, but it is also much less damage from deep wounds when you proc it off of extra hits from cleave or when hamstring crits, and it's also more cooldown efficient for overpower, which you can overload, especially during retaliation, and it also makes overpower more rage effiicent.
---
I like that you are enthusiastic about this, but it's BAD.
---
Even a 2.8 speed 1 hander is going to increase your rage usage by like 25% when cleave spamming, over a 3.5 speed 2 hander.
---
that's a huge amount of ground to make up, and it's WHY smites and the strike of the hydra are so important).
---
Again with categorical statements ..... "completely destroying" 
---
Yes there will be effect of layering but to completely destroy the idea of cohesive world is a bit extreme. 
---
I could give you unlikely examples of Illidan 1, 2, 3 solution as well.
---
With your encouragement, I did just that. :) Better yet, the artist kindly sent me a reply!  
---
Unfortunately, /u/Conpatshe is a little too busy with life to rework the piece at this time, and didn't offer a quote. I suggested they let me know if they change their mind, or determined what they'd be willing to charge for a fresh commission. C'est la vie
---
Well fuck. Guess I won't bother playing it for the next 3 months then?  In all seriousness, it's likely we'll get some queues either way, but that has NEVER proven to be detrimental to long term success of a game.  Completely destroying Classic's cohesive world, however, will no doubt have significant impact on game enjoyment and success.

You can't win with some people. Gotta simply ignore those.

Just seems a little strange in stream. Always in a plain white t shirt. Plays for 30+ hours at a time. One time he was really hunched over and I told him something like “hey man you check your posture or your back will hurt after a while.” And he said “I’ll fix it later”.

I played Stress Test Server 15 for the last stress test, and it was actually unplayable even in coldridge valley. That test server had minimal layering, while server 3 had it stronger so I heard/read. There was 30+ people camping every single wolf spawn. Every single Trogg spawn. Every boar. Even outside coldridge valley near Kharanos everything was camped. I legit could not play the game because I was stuck at level 2 and couldn't quest or grind mobs.
---
I even partied and that didn't help, especially for quests like the opener where it's drops needed, not just kill counters.
---
&gt;Thanks so much babe, best gift ever ;)
---
Our guild totally has plans to do drunk raids. All of us are over the age of 21 and we totally plan to have a few raids where we’re going to be feeling pretty good.
---
My old raid leader in WoW would get so high we’d usually have to have our secondary raid leader take over.
---
Any personal attack get downvoted heavily and do not represent any majority oppinion , I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Not very hard at all. It's just some starwood and dust iirc.
---
I know it's not vanilla, but I started playing when TBC launched and hit 70 with 31 days /played. Loved every minute of it.
---
CoA and Corruption have a 100% coefficient, which isn't bad at all. Also, I don't think that the survivability of SL is worth the trade-off of ruin, bane, shadowburn, and grim reach. Just because you aren't spam shadowbolts, doesn't mean that you want to invalidate all of your destruction spells. Also, the value of shadowburn cannot be understated.
---
Either way, there is not much point to this conversation. We both have good points. Warlocks have a lot of flexibility with with talents for pvp. You could go into a normal BG as sm/ruin, nightflag, drakedog, sl/ruin, or sl/nightfall and do good. And as for what will be meta for Classic pre-mades, it has yet to be seen as thing aren't going to be the same as vanilla or private servers.

There's not going to be an unofficial realm for any language. All of EU is only getting a handful of realms. The dominant language on each will be English.

 \[H\] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)     
---
While wanting to relive past     heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to  progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days  in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high  expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid  nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated  poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to  recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a  4+ night per week raiding schedule.
---
Off  nights are to be    spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20  man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last  thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding  schedule, farming  consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile  to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders   of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of   leadership   experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)        
---
    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!     
---
**Loot System:**

    Loot Council     
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.     
---
**Core Raider Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)        
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)        
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

Priest is very strong in classic. Your Shadow Word Pain is one of the hardest hitting, longest lasting DoTs. You also have a lot of flexibility with your healing. Your biggest counters will be hunters outranging you / viper stinging you, and melee’s who outgear you blowing you up.  One issue is that you are pretty immobile, as well.
---
Priest in classic is one of my favorite classes because of all the fun utility, and Mind Control is way stronger in vanilla than any other expansion.
---
Have fun in game!!
---
Having a pet lets you clear mobs way faster, and the ammo isn't really that expensive

Dude this is me right now on a pserver. Why do I keep running out of steam around lvl 30?
---
Wow, that’s beyond amazing.  Cute gift, I’m jealous!
---
Hunter survival over mm, tauren over dorf. No locks at the top. What retard made this shit?
---
"Princess" can mean BRD princess and Mara princess. I've never seen "LFM Princess". In both of these cases, that's because there's specific parts of the dungeon you can do, and you're specifically going for the last boss and skipping the rest of it.
---
You don't do partial runs of DM. You go in there and fully clear the dungeon.
---
Should I go human male paladin or female dwarf?
---
Wasnt intentionally violate the rule of this sub. It was more about the actual Classic Hype and for a lot of people the word Crossroads really dings.
---
You realise that they're not gonna create 3x realms for each language right? (PVE, PVP, RP) The way it's being implemented gives people the option to play on the realm type they prefer, instead of forcing them into a realm type they might dislike, just because it's the German realm (or whatever your native language might be)
---
Hey man I heard no nations no borders in the last political speech over here. ONE PEOPLE /s

Did you even play Vanilla? This list is terrible.

A carrion bird has the ability to Bite alongside Screech.
---
Claw and Screech are at odds with each other.
---
You can’t go wrong with either. My friend and I played the priest/hunter combo and one advantage is the Viper Sting + Mana Burn combo which is so obnoxious. You will definitely be a bit more self sufficient and able to hold your own as a pally though, the bubble is really crucial for surviving getting focused. Your blessing of freedom will also help your hunter to avoid getting locked down, so he can kite. I would say go with what you prefer, and if you generally like priest, go with that!

Caster farm nozdormu rep for ring

Off the top of my head, these are the big ones

Depends how lucky you are with greens :)

Yeah it's almost like they have 3 specs :O

Epic Games also bad. Remember, brother.
---
I’m choosing horde simply off aesthetics. Cool cities &amp; also I like the fact that the races aren’t human, short human, even shorter human, and long eared oxygen deprived human. I will miss IF tho
---
Female dwarf 1000x over
---
Well, he's not wrong
---
same here. That's why I'll be leveling a dwarf priest and NE druid in parallel (switch between the two when you're feeling bored). That way, you can heal and tank at all levels, and you'll always get groups.
---
Hopefully it's like, 15 minutes or more. 
---
At the same time, hopefully it's only like 1 minute or less. 
---
Who knows when/if/why your friends/guildies might get "Layered" to another shard randomly, and it would suck to not be able to play with them for 15+ minutes. At that same token, it needs to not be able to be exploited like it is.
---
Gonna be honest.. I was in that group. Even though I wanted classic I never thought they would actually do it. Didn't make sense to me at the time. But I suppose retail is so far from classic it's almost like 2 different games so it makes sense in hindsight.
---
Glad I was wrong
---
It would be awesome if you found the original outland zone that was planned before tbc did that one.
---
Yes, because Blizzard always makes changes when people rag on them. Wait... \*remembers old BfA beta forums\*.
---
Right, but again - not enough to invalidate MC or make guilds not want to do it.
---
I was a dwarf hunter. Can remember more horde names than alli
---
Vanilla servers cap was like 3.5k if im not wrong.
---
Do the same now, if a server goes dead in a few months, merge it. Simple and avoids layering possible problems and bugs.
---
This cinematic is yet another reminder of the melodramatic soap opera retail has turned into.
---
This is nothing. Some private server (Rebirth I think) asked for like 20-30K. They shut off the server, waited for donations and turned it back on. A month or 2 later they said they got a cease and desist I believe.
---
They are already complaining about stupid shit on Twitter
---
[https://i.imgur.com/WDNa1Ga.png](https://i.imgur.com/WDNa1Ga.png)
---
Truth be told there is certainly enough people in sweden norway denmark to fill up 1 server and if it starts to fade in pop we all speak fluent english anyway.
---
I'm just wondering if some cases might be problematic! My take is that this version of layering is a test one, this is definitely a non-issue. Live game is what will be problematic or not.
---
To be fair, we have horrible companies like EA shoving unfinished trash down our throats with the promise of it getting good later. With all the abuse the gaming industry has been given, some amount of scarring is to be expected.

Obviously not, you can physically roll nelf or human, but really yes.
---
Fear Ward and Desperate Prayer are godly. Stoneforming blind is also pretty neat compared to racials you never use
---
You completely miss the point

So this is how classic dies . . . with thunderous applause.
---
Reminds me of Osrs subreddit, there was an issue with poll results being shown in real time and people complained of poll bias because people often tend to vote with the majority or not vote at all because their choice isnt close to passing. Then Jagex hides the poll results until after the poll is over then people were screeching on how with hidden results they could rig the polls in favor of what they wanted and not the community. There is just no pleasing some people.
---
ive done 2 wand runs (human and night elf zones, no help whatsoever) and got the lesser by level ~11ish for both.  got the greater in westfall by 14 and had the mats for it during 13 in darkshore.  this was with no concentrated grinding, but i did kill any humanoid i saw along the way.  
---
farming linen off of level 5-7 mobs to try and get the lesser early doesn't seem worth it since the drop rate is pretty bad.  &gt;10 mobs drop a shitload of linen which is how i was able to get the greater magic so fast
---
Probably Tipsout.
---
It's not about problems it's about speed and efficiency. I get that most people don't care but for some people this is fun
---
Yes that would be a disadvantage, but if only for a month you would end up playing together before 60 ( for most people )
---
Damn, the Zandalari were in Vanilla?

\*slowly eating popcorn\*

I can see the spec in the bottom right corner now. Well played.
---
Why is it better to have 10 international servers than 6 international, 1 german, 1 french, 1 italian, 1 spanish? If population drops from a server, it drops. No matter the language spoken on it.
---
Great choice on the frame! I dig it.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the info!
---
Yup. That's the one.
---
Yeah I was thinking the same, I have played a human male for years on retail and it will be nice with a change. Also all the animations are epic.
---
* Player name conflicts
---
* Guild name conflicts
---
* Clashing economies
---
* Friends/guildies unable to join if subservers fill quickly
---
* Doesn't address overcrowded starting zones or will have extremely low population limits on launch
---
Split server might be your preferred solution, but it just introduces new problems.
---
I find the idea more appealing than the reasons
---
&gt; Why would you have zg in when it invalidates almost all of the early loot
---
I think I understand the point, I just don't agree with it. 
---
People would still run MC, and the vast majority of your raid would still greatly benefit from the gear there.
---
Pretty much as soon as you're fighting humanoid mobs. You can 100% get it before level 10. You just need to farm enough linen cloth to make  
---
You need 54 linen cloth. You turn these into bolts of linen. This will get you to level 30 Tailoring. You craft 9 Brown Linen Robes. You disenchant them for 9 dusts. That will get you to level 10 Enchanting for the Lesser Wand Recipe. 
---
Hopefully you get 1 lesser magic essence from the robes. I'm pretty sure vendors sell them though if you don't. I could be wrong on that though.
---
People ask for an alternative to sharding - &gt; Blizzard offers layering - &gt; People ask for sharding as an alternative to layering.
---
The Uroboros of r/classicwow. I feel like watching season 2 of Dark.
---
A better way to put it is everyone trying to tag a named mob.
---
Why does it have to represent a majority opinion to be a problem?
---
1 person making 100 comments is going to have more of an impact/notice than 50 different people doing 1 comment. 
---
So yes, it might be 10% of the base, but if they are generating 30% of the posts then people are going to notice.
---
&gt; The customer has to tell the systems engineers and software developers what they want! There are constant meetings and updates/progress reports along the way. The customer doesn’t just set a finish date and wait expecting a perfect product with no progress reports in between! 
---
I do believe this is where scope creep is spawned.
---
You don’t understand the point at all actually, this is low iq thinking
---
That's sadly (the dream of a United North slowly fading in the distance) the main reason to not make Nordic servers an option.
---
oh i totally agree, i wouldnt care if i couldnt play with friends for the first few weeks myself, id make some new friends running some deadmines and be happy, just thinking about other people that tend to not be happy with a decision either way
---
One consideration I haven’t seen mentioned is that as horde your DoTs are going to get dispelled all the time from priests/pallies. Whereas as alliance, normally nobody on horde can be bothered dispelling as priest will be their only dispeller.
---
this is great lol, know the feeling the others have right at that moment :P
---
Watched the video, looks like he worked for a company that commited fraud, so from my limited understanding, the people saying tips commited a 800k fraud are people that dislike him and make up rumors?

That's great to know 😊 that's earlier thenbi expected :)
---
We have been burned enough times recently by Blizzard just letting game breaking bugs be transferred from beta to release to have jaded expectations.
---
TLDR is too long
---
I raided in Vanilla.  Pretty casual back then just as I plan on being now.  Made it to AQ before TBC hit.
---
Some retard already started on Twitter
---
I guess the horde might want to go there to sneak in and plunder SW as well? Maybe not as a coordinated attack, but just some adventures seeing an opportunity for profit and glory
---
I'll be damned. We'll, as I said, it's been some 20 years so my memory was a bit foggy. Have a great evening or day or whenever you are :)

I hear ya. I mean English comes so natural to us its no point and truth be told I like playing with the rest of Europe they just need to understand English.

The only part of BFA that I enjoy is the cinematics. They should just make a movie already.
---
Good idea, but this ain't it, chief.
---
&gt; I've been seeing rumblings about stacking spirit lately.  
---
its not so much about stacking spirit, but more so about just making sure you have some. There are an awful lot of items that are str/sta/spirit where you hardly lose any main stats for the addition to spirit. grab those when you can.
---
It most certainly has cons I didn't say it that it didn't. I was just pointing out that this solution doesn't have any of these issues that you and OP is talking about.
---
Feedback and complaining are required for change
---
But why not also make the game 4:9, let the game have queue times, leave the game breaking bugs in. What's the line you cross and where do you stop?
---
Leeway is a relic of a different time. If we have the technology not to depend on it why keep it. It's not a gameplay design decision. It's just the result of the time.
---
The biggest concern I have about layering still is doesn't it bring a lot more resources into the economy. For example if you have 3 layers isn't that 3 times the herbs/ore/chests spawning?
---
How about adding a secret higher level dungeon inside of stockades, some sort of key attunement that opens a hidden door to the true prison, the prison where stormwind hides the real bad mofos, some old school dungeon crawling into a maze like prison with captured big baddies, random rares, sewer waters with bigass crocolisks, waltzing into a room full of non elites that will zerg you. So many possibilies they could put down there.
---
Why?  Stockades is so short and boring.
---
Feel free to try to explain it.
---
Well I hope you end up on a spanish unofficial server, cabròn !! /s
---
Have the defuff show if it's preventing you from switching due to joining a group but not under normal play.
---
I don't think that is how it works, when you log in you are not changing layer, your character is bound to the 1 layer when you log in. I hope so anyway.
---
This made me smile as my thoughts were, "Sweet, now I know what server not to roll on." then I click it and get this gem.
---
But seriously, ai don't want to game with a bunch of meta gaming assholes who's idea of a fun time is to break out the TI-83's to get to work on how best to optimize their shit breaks inbetween leveling.

That's a 100% confirmed bug.

I am sure he will nut inside for that :P

Borderlands 2 just released some free DLC that allows you to boost to lvl 30. I'm squeezing every last drop of enjoyment out of this game. I started playing a pserver but I'm sure I'll burn out after launch if I feel like I'm redoing everything I've done over the last couple of months.
---
Just, other games my dude. Been chilling on MTG and overwatch with friends. Planning on picking up a game or two this summer sale.
---
That's not true, it's his father company and hes one of the chief executive officers, tips also has a 5.6million house.
---
No, they aren’t all assholes and dumbasses, that just the small fraction of a person that you get to see.
---
Real money. Watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClB5278A2xo
---
I like this answer the best. The difference is so negligible, if you have one you likely don't care about the other.
---
You should be able to make a lesser magic wand by level 10 if you roll tailoring with enchanting
---
You are letting fear and what if’s sway your opinion. We all want a smooth and playable launch, and that’s what layering accomplish
---
/sadcringe
---
&gt; bro. wut. are these tips based off how things are in private servers? never bother with spirit as a warrior.  
---
then you were missing out, spirit regen is pretty damn OP for warr  
---
don't 'stack' it, but make sure you have a few pieces. will have next to zero downtime.
---
Im going for horde because of orcs 
---
Id like to imagine I play in Middle earth as an orc hunting hobbits
---
funny because i see a lot of people talking about being retri in raids and other stupid shit i dont want to deal with...
---
That's great! Having the exact numbers is super helpful thank you 😊 I'll strongly consider running priest (and nelf priest so plenty of humanoids)
---
&gt;I remember avoiding the topic of my age all I could.
---
I was the same age in Vanilla and also raided in a high-end guild. I did this too and pretended I didn't have a mic for the longest time.
---
Even when I got a mic it was still a surprise to my guild when I finally revealed my age. They didn't seem to mind, but looking back it was kind of funny all the same.
---
swifty ofc
---
Cool list. Why show both the male and female race icons every time? Really takes up a ton of space and makes it more challenging to read than it needs to be.
---
Sitting right in the middle.
---
That said, I believe you should roll nelf priest and use shadowmeld to hide and dispel hard-earned-classic-world-buffs from hordies in BRM.
---
I wonder why did blizzard not place a graveyard in that zones, such a massive oversight
---
Ya, I am pretty confident this never existed
---
Maybe both I don't know. This is about some construction company he used to be in:
---
I want to play UD Warrior but I know orc is better
---
Does anybody feel as if there are going to be a greater number of females chosen as their characters over males, in contrast to when Vanilla retail previously? 
---
I’ve been running around on a private server and have seen tons of female dwarves.  Was this common in Vanilla?
---
does d2 really tho? seems sizably smaller just from the amount of activity on youtube subreddit etc, i know it still has a dedicated fanbase and hardcore blizzard north fanboys (imagine fanboying a dead division of a company) D3 may have been a hot dumpster fire on release, but everything post ros is a really solid game that while different from diablo 2 is totally a good game in its own right. However I must concede im sure that blizzard north would have produced something much closer the the darker tone of the first two games and most likely would have been better recieved out of that gate (i say that with no evidence but some old d3 sneak peek footage and just looking that bnorths track record)
---
Where are the wildhammer dwarves? they are a faction with rep although you can't really do anything with them
---
More populated servers mean better guild options, more opportunities for player relationships, better auction houses.  
---
There really is no downside to layering that can’t be fixed.  
---
There is no non-trivial solution to a server with 500 people online peak time.  You have to either allow transfers, which fragments the community, or merges, which come with their own problems.
---
Thanks for the responses, your points actually make me feel better about going priest! Also leveling as shadow seems so much more appealing than leveling as ret.
---
It is a problem to a small slice of the over all wow classic community.
---
wow quality post bro i'd love to have you in my guild
---
Well I came asking for advice narrowing down my options, and you suggested something not even on my list.  That would be like if someone said "I can't decide between Rogue and Warrior" and you start pointing them at a Shaman instead.
---
"If you don't think you can handle both abilities individually" - it's literally impossible.  You can have one or the other.  You can micro to go back and forth, but they are at odds with each other.  Both are focus dumps, so you literally cannot use them together.  Every time your pet has a GCD, it can either Claw or Screech, it cannot do both.  So you can do 100% Claw and no Screech, or you can do 100% Screech and no Claw.  In both cases you're wasting Training Points.
---
If you Micro it, you can do 50% claw and 50% screech, or you can do 80/20, or whatever ratio floats your boat.  But you're still using one at the exclusion of the other.
---
On the other hand, if your action bar looks like Growl - Bite - Screech, then you will have a lot of focus spent on Screech, but use Bite on cooldown.  This means you get the more damage-per-focus out of having Bite over Claw, and still get significant use out of screech.  
---
Carrion Birds can use both Bite and Claw.  Bats only have Bite, Owls only Claw.  Because Bite and Screech work better together, Bats and Carrion Birds have a significant advantage.  Bats have similar damage profiles as Owls (both are +7%), while Carrion Birds have better tank stats.
---
The only reason people say Owls are better, is because of Claw and +7% damage.  But they don't think about how Claw and Screech clash with each other.  They're just thinking "Claw is more DPS than Bite, so it's better", but they're not thinking about how having Screech changes that.
---
Even then, if I didn't have Screech, I'd rather have Bite than Claw, because I've had times where Claw will get in the way of Growl, and I'll pull threat off my pet.  Screech generates enough threat that if it clips Growl, it's not an issue.
---
If you're planning on using Claw, then a Cat is so much better than an owl, because it has 3% more damage, has Bite in addition to Claw, and because most cats have a faster attack speed for more frenzy up-time.  If you're planning on using Screech, then pairing that with a Bat (for damage) or a Carrion Bird (for tankiness) with Bite is better than clashing with Claw.
---
With any other pet, Claw is better than Bite.  This goes for Bite+Claw pets like Cats or Bears, or even if you're trying to pick between something like a Turtle or a Crab.  Screech is largely a replacement for Claw, as it does slightly less damage, but serves as a focus dump.  People don't think about that when they apply "Claw &gt; Bite" to birds.
---
I remember there was a bug where you were able to carry the flag as a passenger in a Hog/Chopper. Not sure if it work with the Mammoths too.

Please hand over your beta invite.. You simply dont deserve it

nothing. I'm just spending my free time watching WoW videos, reading guides, and playing with talent trees.

Good points! I think im gonna do the priest!! Shadow form to level just seems way more fun than ret as well.

What does this have to do with WOW?
---
it was for newer/struggling guilds to prep for MC back then, although Hakkar was argueably harder then all but Raggy

Very cool, my fiancé still doesn’t know I play wow
---
Reposting this so soon? Thirsty for those internet points eh?
---
Perhaps log in, check the queue timer, do chores, mow the lawn, pick up groceries. Do anything productive you would otherwise do for those 2 hours. And then enjoy an hour or two when you finally get in. Or, if that doesn’t work, then simply don’t base your day schedule around a game at its launch period. 
---
Would you rather they keep layering in indefinitely if the population never shrinks to 3k?
---
PSA customer feedback is integral to making a product the customer wants.  I know this blows your mind so I'm here to help.
---
Where was Blizzard before the community outcry to play classic?  They were losing droves of subscribers in most Post Wotlk expansions.
---
It took years of driven community "yelling" to get here.
---
This doesn't mean we did the work or we fixed the systems.  But it does mean the customer is integral to customer driven product development.
---
Attack speed doesn't affect ranged damage, but in leveling and PvP my Wind Serpent will be in melee range.
---
halt stop wer wie was wo.
---
link?
---
I'm not saying that it's the perfect solution I'm just saying that there are other options.
---
*Player and guild names are obviously shared across all layers to avoid conflicts
---
*Crashing economies? What do you mean by this, it's literally the same game same launch how would there be a crash with the economy
---
* You will be able to make your characters 2 weeks in advance, but yes filling could be an issue fair enough
---
* It addresses overcrowded starting zones the exact same way that layering does. 3k players per server.
---
Female human mage/rogue are always virgin minmaxers and probably have "lol", "qt", or "xx" at the end of their name.
---
Source: female human mage with such a name
---
Solid points! Definitely leaning towards the priest now. Thanks for the informative responses yall!
---
It makes a huge difference. On my last pserver 60 I wound up 100% rest XP'ed for levels 56-60 and they just blew by. A new pserver was recently released and the first to 60 was a mage who took 7 hour breaks to sleep; the highest level warrior at the time this mage hit 60 was 43, and he was barely taking breaks. Warriors are a slow class. If you're not oushing to be tanking the first two or three weeks of Classic, leverage that rest XP!
---
I don't think so
---
disney literally owns and governs a town, in every single aspect down to emergency services so they can retain total control, shit is pretty scary honestly but i love me some disneyland so im not going to openly criticize it.
---
You realize I provided 2 options, right? Having people join the one "main" layer at lvl20 would easily be a solution. Creating internal timers for different actions has brought up many concerns.
---
oof, did someone else use the picture already? I just put on the text and didn't check
---
Old School Runescape. That's the only response needed for this argument.
---
**1.** I don‘t give a damn about server type. Language has the top most priority in the game for me. Really. I don‘t give a shit about the AV version, the progression, the graphics, the animations, whatever. What I value the most is a server solely for my language. (actually I do give a shit about those other things but language has absolute top priority)
---
**2.** You work at Blizzard or how do you know they would, will or will not do? You do realize that, e.g. German is (on of?) the most popular languages in Europe?
---
You so realize that we had **tons** of servers for each language during vanilla? Do you have so litte confidence in Classic that you think Europe will get what, 3-6 servers in total?
---
I don't have one, and shut the fuck up.
---
Or they could just gate the new content behind existing rep grinds and raid kills, and also use diminishing returns on gear stats, which means that the new content would only slightly boost your stats and would seem useless, but over time and the culmination of new content it would be worthwhile compared to those who don't pursue it
---
What would be really cool is the entire WoW gets restarted.
---
Like Classic to BC etc. Stopping at either WotLK or MoP. Or *maybe* even Legion.
---
Couldn't agree more with op
---
PvP is such a broad category that you really have to be very specific to make a list like this.
---
For instance SM/Ruin is a great Warlock spec for BG's. For wPvP or duels I'd much rather be a Soul Link specced.
---
Don't level as holy. You can heal 5 mans just fine as ret, flash of light is still super good.
---
If you really want to get some points in Holy I would recommend going 30 ret 21 holy. You can get most of the decent holy talents while still being able to do damage. 
---
Obviously you start with 30 points in ret. You fill out the second half of your build as holy when dungeons start getting a little harder.
---

Why are you angry at me? Not my fault you dont know what the purpose of beta testing is.

You topped the dps meter.  Seems to me like you EARNED those drops.  This moment was simply karma at work.

Way off there pal
---
I was feeling like the hype is just in this small little subreddit and it won’t be as popular as anyone thinks, but I think I was pretty surprised when a random Classic WoW comment in r/CFB (college football) got 33 upvotes about it coming out. Generally football fans are not your normal group that play games like WoW, so I was EXTREMELY surprised that so many people upvoted and commented.
---
That's not gonna happen, you'll be in a faction with 2500 other people, should be plenty of friendly people on both sides
---
Lol not at all, that's just the simplest way of explaining something. Every class can do it with stun trinket or any CC ability.

AHAHAH good opening, thanks mate
---
yep, actually.    
---
I just thought it would be fitting, but now it's gotta go, I don't need internet points, I just wanted to make people laugh
---
You can't make language-specific servers because there's just too many fucking languages in the EU. You think Lithuania has enough players to fill one entire server? Hungary? Greece?
---
The best solution I see is universal servers, but with clear indication where the servers are located. This way large communities can still congregate on a single server, and the minorities... well they have to make do, too bad so sad.
---
Ahh Kara and Hyjal... my two favorite raids. Doubt they’ll do anything with them but wow I’d cry if they did
---
Sounds like a good idea but unless if you have a guild account to share the banks with, that comes out to require quite a lot of bank access requests to the GM(or whoever has the bank alt).
---
Another concern is people publicly speaking their own language (e.g. in trade chat) excluding the people who only knows english in an english server.
---
An analogy to this is when playing counterstrike and having to listen to the 2 french (just an example, no offence) guys speaking french with eachother and not understanding. Not communicating with the rest of the team. This is so annoying!
---
For sure. That's my plan actually, make those robes asap and then drop tailoring. Will probably end up Alch/enchanting or if I decide to go heavy pvp eng/herb.
---
Title came in Wrath unfortunately. After a long pirate grind you can be friendly with both factions and its cool being able to walk past them all without agro.
---
It wouldn't be the trademark that Blizzard needs to defend. The IP they are concerned with is the copyright and they don't have to be constantly defending it in order to go after private servers. It's Blizzard's intellectual property, and they can decide if they want to sue and shutdown servers.
---
The horde is just orc, hairy orc, skinny orc and skinny dead orc /s
---
You are actually retarded ok
---
No.. why does everyone think this? 
---
I'll challenge you as well, hop on retrowow and lets try this then. You all seem to say it's so easy to just instantly use an ability after someone charges you. So lets go then, I'll log on my warrior and charge you, all you have to do is cast an ability on me while I'm charging you. Do this 5 times in a row and I'll concede my point. Deal?
---
Fuck. This means they are really going to keep layering. Way to go Blizzard....
---
I agree, which is why I fail to see how it "invalidates" MC.
---
You guys seem to be confusing the definition of TOS and EULA and the rights that Blizzard has. The TOS is about the rules while playing the game. The EULA is a licensing agreement that all the private servers are breaking by just standing them up and allowing others to connect and use them. The biggest issue that comes up is when a private server starts making money off of Blizzard's intellectual property.
---
&gt; Some mage got a 2 Day 17hour level 60 on one of those fresh new servers to celebrate classic release.
---
This was achieved abusing the fuck out of dynamic re-spawns. This wont be possible on Classic.
---
Kinda feel like just being in combat should trigger the CD.  
---
Lots of (reasonable) triggers and a short (3-5 minute) CD would be ideal I think. This way you can always just run off for a couple of minutes and switch layers, but you can’t really abuse the system to farm.  
---
What might work even better is a camping mechanic (not a suggestion as they’ve already picked a method). When you want to switch layers it starts a 3-5 minute timer at the end of which you’ll switch.  Combat, looting, or otherwise interacting with the game in a way that alters your character or inventory would stop the timer (but sitting in a chair, walking around, or eating or drinking would not).
---
How cool would an STV 100 player battle royale be.

Leeway mechanic is looking really problematic in 2019

You can insult my intelligence all you like, I'm not the one going on a crusade over something that will in all likelihood not happen.

As a father, planning when I get to play can be very difficult at times.

I'm perfectly content with a cooldown solution, and I don't think it will be an issue at all for me when I play the game, as long as it is removed for phase 2.

Saw people switching layers to go into the Gurubashi Arena, then switch out of it to gank people there when the chest was there.

Incredibly lame and something that won't be affected by any of those changes, unfortunately.

That's good to hear.  I mean, there were literally at least 700 people (possibly a couple thousand) across several layers there in Stormwind.   It's not surprising that things were glitching out.
---
POGGERS AND MANY TWITCH PRIMES!!!!
---
The French Retail servers sees an average of 1016 characters login every 30 days. That's characters, not players with separate accounts.
---
And while that number may not be relevant, the percentages are.
---
* English is 65.03% of the active playerbase.
---
* German is 20.72%.
---
* French is 8.86%.
---
* Italian is 2.93%.
---
* Spanish is 2.06%.
---
* Portuguese is 0.12%.
---
There's absolutely no argument to be made that one of these countries/regions will see a larger return of players to Classic than any other.
---
Blizzard has better numbers than all of us. They know how many people have clicked on articles about Classic, they know how many people opted-in to the Beta, they have exact active player counts for every day since 2005. They have everything they need to make the best estimate of what the playerbase on launch will be and what it will be after each phase. It might not be a correct guess, but it is much better than anyone else can speculate.
---
And with those numbers, Blizzard decided not to make language specific realms. You're just going to have to live with that fact.
---
So many idiots talking like they know shit here..
---
Man, I felt like Shimmering Flats was worse than STVietnam on Nost.

I am just going through some indie games lately. Enter the Gungeon atm. Most of the big games are not really worth it these days and indie is currently skyrocketing. Honestly, there are literal gems out there.
---
If the cooldown is 2 mins for getting to the layer your friends are in, I can't see how that will punish the average player.
---
I'd rather not try to gank someone and see them disappear in front of my eyes because they haven't jumped layers since they logged in.
---
Really want to be a horde shadow priest. Troll or UD?

your attempts to justify it are hilarious, keep going
---
I've been playing Heros of the Storm. Playing Warcraft heros only :D
---
Because it's NOT CLASSIC. This isn't a new mmorpg, this is a replica of vanilla, it's only goal being the recreation of the game as it was then. When will you people understand this?
---
I think you’re supposed to call or go to a doctor after 4 hours.
---
Where did I insult your intelligence?
---
I am going on a crusade as many others went on a crusade for things that were important to them in Classic before. Like sharding. Or whatever, there were many topics. I did not go on a crusade then but this now is very important to me and as Blizzard appears to be listening to feedback I am giving mine as loud as I can to at least try to change their mind.
---
Just to point out that in many projects these days there are not necessarily a single PM. In many of our projects there is a Lead engineer that is responsible for exactly this kind of feedback. So this Lead can then go back to the team and work for a solution. This is actually very common in the industry these days.
---
Then you are also now talking about both B2C (Business-to-Customer) and B2B (Business-to-business), they are very different. In B2B many customers DEMAND daily or at least weekly updates on your progress, whether it is good or bad. This is not the case in B2C, which is our situation with Blizzard.

I see this as an absolute win. The explosion of asshattery around this place since the beta opened up is a good sign for the game, because it means that the plan is working and the target demographic is fully engaged. Who did you think was going to be playing this game anyway?

Hell yea, love Thunder Bluff. It’s good to see Thrall and the gang back together even though I haven’t played since Cata.

Beta: With UD priest solo, I had to grind a full level 10-11 on Scarlet mobs to get the linen for the wand. My thoughts are that you may not be able to grind on fresh. 
---
Stress Test: Leveled to 10 with UD priest, mage, and warlock. Funneled cloth to priest. We had 2 wands at 10.
---
My thoughts are that I may have been unlucky doing it solo in Beta, or the stress test drops rates where changed. Either way you should be able to get it early enough.
---
Most work this caliber is going to probably run you $300 or over., Just my experience.
---
While this is indeed very relevant and explains a lot, it also tells you something else: that basically 35% of the player base can go fuck themselves with their language and have to deal with english communities for the sake of respecting the numbers. 
---
Also, are these numbers for EU only? Or do they count NA and OCE for example, as a global number?
---
Do you happen to know if ferocious bite has any potential? I'm not expecting 2k crits like eviserate, but maybe 1k+?
---
Oh cool!! Now we can layer forever guys, all the worries are gone
---
Yeah 20 is big, outside of that if your brother is going hunter then you're basically negating all the solo leveling issues a rogue has. With the pet tanking and being able to snap and trap you guys should be breezing through difficult quests or pulls.
---
&gt; The original record by Joana was done on a fresh server without layering.
---
What? He pulled this record in 2006. I'm not sure if the server was fresh but the old vods I looked at looked like he did 1-20 with almost no competition. 
---
There will be layering in Classic, but there will still *certainly* be more competition on Classic than the old record he had with no layering.
---
I think WotLK succeeded at bridging the gap between those two design outcomes for reputations/factions. All the factions in Northrend have a good reason to be there and good reasons to want the player's aid.

Great game, poop graphics, but it's only a tenner since the steam sale and will eat up hours if you like that kind of thing.

I'm getting flashbacks to an inductive logic course I took like 2 years ago
---
Blizzard has better numbers that you could even dream of.
---
They know how many people of each region click on articles about Classic.
---
They know how many people of each region opted-in to the Beta.
---
They know how many people of each region have installed Battle.NET and preloaded Classic.
---
They know how many people of each region have logged in to the game every hour of every day since the launch in early 2005.
---
And that's just the tip of the iceberg. They have entire departments that mess with these kinds of numbers all day. They know everything and we know very little.
---
Their decision is MUCH more informed than ours. And that decision led to them not giving Germany (~20% of the active playerbase in EU) their own realm. Which means all of EU is unlikely to see more than 5 realms at launch.
---
With regard to PVE DPS or PVP?
---
I'm getting flashbacks to an inductive logic course I took like 2 years ago. Fantastic write up. :)
---
What's this a reference to? /r/OutOfTheLoop
---
I agree, some languages will not hold up. But the large communities like french and german will absolutely "invade" servers, and make it their own. Meaning people will have to deal with french or german instead of english. Minorities can join an international server, but french and german at least (because they're larger communities) should have a server.
---
Only a wrath baby casual uses a TI-83, true minmaxers pull out the protractor for precise shit-bucket positioning.
---
Wonder how this affects “/1 group up for elite quest?” and keep questing in the zone.
---
Layering is meant to handle overflow, too.
---
I bet after Phase 1, they will offer free realm transfers to those on realms with 2+ layers. You will either take the free transfer, or deal with the login queues.

There would be multiple independent economies building on each subserver. The longer each economy is separated from one another, the greater the risk of harm in combining them as the larger the differences can be.
---
&gt; It addresses overcrowded starting zones the exact same way that layering does. 3k players per server. A rather big flaw here is if they start at 3k per layer and the pop slowly decreases then you would have to wait for 1k pop layered before merge, there's some solutions to this too like minimerges between layers, that is if merges can be done in a quick and efficient way. 
---
No it doesn't. Layers allow blizz to choose a smaller target population on launch day. The system then just creates layers on demand, keeping starting zones within that target population. As people spread out they will merge.
---
Mario maker 2 launches in 2 days so I'm excited for that. Also playing some path of exile in the meantime
---
Is paladin a decent pairing with a rogue, friend is getting into the game and wants to play a rogue i played a mage back in the day so thinking paladin this time around as its a different play style.
---
Because gender equality is a hot topic.
---
I'm assuming you're from Vlaanderen? In Brussels an Wallonië spreken we frans, dus zijn er 5 miljoenen meer franstaligen. I'm from Brussels and I play on french servers like all my belgian friends.
---
Even if it has 1 hour cooldown how often will you party up with your friends, leave their group and need to regroup again in small timespans?
---
Respeccing from enhance will mean you have to relevel 2h skills if you go back to enhance. That's probably what op meant
---
Check nobbels chanel on YouTube he has a great selection of lore videos, im sure you Will find What you want, on the other hand if you feel like going oldschool check out "lore for noobs"
---
Imagine BC content but without the BC expansion.
---
So you are saying that a bit more NAXX loot made up all the difference of over a month on most kills over TR, IE/Lethe and everyone else.........Keep going this is getting entertaining that you can not handle that you were outplayed.
---
It doesn’t make a huge difference either way, but I will say arms is better if you’re leveling with a healer. Rend gains a lot of value when you’re pulling a lot of mobs as does sweeping strikes, something that doesn’t really happen when you’re solo.
---
You the only one bothered lol.  Dem spiteful downvotes.
---
That's almost half the amount of time it took them to make the game from scratch.
---
I'm curious as a general matter, are any of the proc-on-get-crit talents that various specs have useful at all in PvE, if /sit to get crit is not going to be a thing in Classic?
---
In other games I've played those do-X when you receive a critical hit sort of procs are relegated to PvP only usage, because the game mechanics are such that in PvE the NPC attacks can't crit. But I'm not familiar with NPC mechanics in Classic, so I wonder, are PvE enemies able to crit you, and will they do it often enough to make these talents worth taking? Or are they unable to or have such low crit rates that none of these talents that proc from receiving crits will be useful?
---
I could be wrong but im pretty sure you only see chat from people who are on the same layer as you being as they are meant to be server sized chunks of people. So all the looking for more spam you see should all also be from the same layer. The only way it would be a problem is if someone in the group wants to invite one of their friends who has too recently swapped layers. I havnt seen a concise breakdown on how things like world chat and trade chat work but that was my understanding of it.
---
The lore in WC3 is extremely important to WoW and is really interesting. Idk what these other guys are talking about.
---
And just how many servers are you expecting, with the knowledge that they're already planning for the population to die off, just out of curiosity? If you think they haven't already got a ballpark number via beta options and other metrics they measure, and are planning their server strategy based off that, then I'm not sure what else to say. Some of us are happy enough we even get classic at all, and are willing to self select and organise with our community ahead of time to group up, like the mods here are suggesting, and others.... Well :)
---
Five million sure, but never twelve.
---
&gt;No it doesn't. Layers allow blizz to choose a smaller target population on launch day. The system then just creates layers on demand, keeping starting zones within that target population. As people spread out they will merge.
---
They literally that this isn't how it's going to work lmao
---
&gt;There would be multiple independent economies building on each subserver. The longer each economy is separated from one another, the greater the risk of harm in combining them as the larger the differences can be.
---
It's literally the same game being played on the same launch with the same pop how the fuck you think there's somehow going to be a different economy? That makes no sense at all.
---

Dude when i was wallclimbing everything there was a spot that looked weird on the map if i remember correctly so i decided to try that, only to be amazed when i discovered the manor and then disappointed that i spent a good hour trying to get there but all in all it was a nice find. Im a warlock so i had no idea it was there and i thought it was so cool!
---
Thoughts? NO!
---
One I commonly hit myself: if you die as alliance in Eastern Ashenvale, you spawn at Astranaar. Better not let those satyrs in shadow run kill you.
---
I think this is the answer, though it depends a little bit on goals. Mages could be very helpful if the goal is to push questing very hard, and you could aggressively move your hearth and have the mage port to cities. Because ports don't become available until long after summons do, I think warlock is the best as long as dungeoning is part of the plan for the leveling process.
---
They're somewhat useful for leveling. Endgame DPS, you shouldn't be getting hit, let alone getting crit! However you have to take Enrage to get Flurry, so it's a moot point. You skip Blood Craze for endgame DPS.
---
Which horde class is best for lock? Mainly PvE with some WPvP.
---
I had 50 days /played on each of them in vanilla. about that free mount-  paladins are slower to level and farm with so, it could easily take you more playing time to get to forty and get the mount on a paladin than on a mage since the mage will get to forty faster.  Pally is still an amazing class, but if I was concerned about gold I'd still go mage here.
---
that makes sense, having 10k+ people in /2 wouldnt really be conducive to trade
---
This post was worth it for this reply alone -- thank you!
---
I'm glad someone else thinks this is interesting and worthwhile.
---
Regarding interrupts, we'll be three Tauren if we run this build: we'll have three available Warstomps, which will help some for the tougher fights. But everything you've said makes perfect sense. It's such an interesting build, because the primary DPS, which I would be playing, will regularly switch to off-tank and heal. It should keep things interesting. When I played rogue in our previous Warrior/Rogue/Priest trio, it was sometimes a little dull. But I'll definitely miss the CC.
---
Your comment and others have definitely convinced me that Balance/Resto makes sense for our primary healer. And, like you said, at level 40, Innervate may provide enough mana to allow not only plenty of healing, but considering DPS from the Balance tree (off-setting the infamous mana issues with Balance).
---
Regarding professions, I think we'll have something like:
---
* Skinning / Leatherworking
---
* Herbalism / Alchemy
---
* Mining / Engineering
---
We'll want to craft armor to fill in the gaps, rely on potions for backup, and engineering for CC + utility.
---
It sounds like you and your wife will have a blast and no doubt Hunter will synergize very well.
---
Thanks again and good luck to you as well!
---
True or not, that doesn't make it an issue man. They've taken the wrong decisions before based on numbers. Don't you remember Ion talking about said numbers to justify pruning? Taking aways spells because they were used by less than 10% players? 
---
Those 20% of germans are absolutely gonna pick an unofficial server for them, and the english speaking guild going there is gonna have a hard time convincing them to speak english. They'll have to deal with a german chat, with german abreviations, german item links and so on. Not giving a server to those guys or the french makes little sense in that regard.
---
Hah, maybe back in 2004. These days it's all about the TI nSpire CAS.
---
Dalaran. Put in some beastly long quest chain that gives an item that lets you pass through the barrier.  
---
I'd make it a hub of 5 dungeons based on the Dalaran Heist campaign in Hearthstone. All dungeons can be run in two modes: defending Dalaran, or looting it with the League of E.V.I.L. kind of like doing a tribute run of DM.
---
Well it's clear no matter what Blizzard due a vocal minority are going to bitch
---
I love this.
---
A cool raid/dungeon would be a caverns of time dungeon during the "black empire" era (when the old gods ruled Azeroth). I think it would go great with the opening of Ahn'Qiraj, and you'll be able to see how distorted everything was...
---
Either that or the ruins of Lordaraen above the undercity would be a cool low-level starter dungeon for the horde. Like blackrock depths/stormwind stockades for the forsaken. Where you fight the remnants of Arthas' scourge.
---
Plus throw a dot on em and they wont stand a chance of catching you.
---
My murderous nature came out as a hunter, felt as a God while leveling lol
---
That’s very debatable
---
&gt;Want to understand the "state of the world" as it is for a lvl 1 character logging in to classic
---
Play Warcraft 3 and The Frozen Throne.
---
Yeah the emerald dream is something I wish they could do post Naxx.
---
Why not?
---
I'm open to hearing more about why certain things wouldn't work; it's useful for learning, and growing discussion.
---
I think you can buy all the necessary parts for the ward from the Enchanter vendor. The only thing is you need to get the skill level which isn't too hard just need to disenchant greens when you get them.
---
I find hamstring kiting and leveling efficiently more  fun than face tanking mobs and dual wielding while hearing the miss sound constantly. The idea that there isn't enough good 2H weapons is really just not true, you also need to constantly upgrade 2 weapons for dual wield.  
---
At 40, you have access to sweeping strikes and mortal strike and your strategy of spamming overpower to kill things is really falling off. At 40, this is where fury is really going to fall behind arms spec. You don't have enough AP to make BT good. Your suggestion to go to fury at 40 is the opposite of what people should be doing. They could use your spec early if they don't have good 2 handers and then switch to 2h arms once they do and can get sweeping strikes.  
---
Using "HS spam" while also trying to abuse overpower is contradicting itself. In practice, you will find yourself using HS very rarely as it really screws up your rage gen (you dont get rage when you HS).   
---
You can only kill one mob at a time most of the time since you can't kite effectively with fast weapons and your cleaves/whirlwinds dont hit hard at all. Sweeping strikes+cleave is overpowered. You will apply a SS to each mob you hit w whirlwind or cleave. So you hit three mobs w whirlwind, and that also sweeping strikes 3 times so each mob gets hit twice. With a fat 2 hander swing not some tiny dagger swing.  
---
Finally, this is not a new idea. People have claimed this is good before but the consensus is it's really not. Sitting and face tanking mobs while you miss and try to spam overpower is just a really inefficient way to play. Learn to hamstring kite. I really don't find it boring to play 2 hander at all.
---
layering is an abomination and needs to be gone no matter what
---
It isn't.  The game since beta has a search function to find players, guilds, classes, and people in a zone.  That is pretty standard search most wow players of any era know it is a max of 50 results per page.    
---
Is this going to be your first time playing wow?
---
I’m really tired of these holier than though people critic](http://)
---
Fair enough, corrected, had forgotten about the context, wrong number to give.
---
I'm leveling in a group shouldnt be a issue and I'm not worried about hitting 60 so quickly want to enjoy the world for a while , yeah mage would be alot quicker especially between 10-20 just due to the fact you can pick up the wand talent and do more dmg .. a lot more in general

---
Does anyone have actual data on how good +weapon damage is or a good working warrior DPS calculator?
---
I want to run warrior for classic.  My brain says go Human for the +5 swords/mace racial, but my heart wants to play a gnome.  So I'm wondering how much I am going to gimp my overall DPS just to play the race that looks better.
---
I cant find anything to play ,Albion 30 hours dropped it, Warthunder 5 hours dropped it, down loading Witcher 3 now fingers crossed.
---
The manor should have been a rogue green zone   and a combat zone for everyone else, regardless of faction.
---
Like, go ahead and break in as another class, but you'll get ambushed like no tomorrow. Would be a neat little detail.
---
Actually got back into playing retail. But like 90% transmog farming, either old raids/dungeons or getting mats to craft old gear. Man it took a surprising amount of time to get the mats for full Dark Iron set.
---
look up
---
You don't use both claw and screech, you make a macro to toggle between them. If someone else is tanking use claw, otherwise use screech. Even when using screech exclusively the owl will outdamage a carrion bird that's also using bite. You can try this out or calculate it, but special abilities just don't make up enough of a pet's damage to outweigh a +7% damage bonus.
---
On my experience from wow back in teh days, while leveling and doing instances, max rank greater heal will easily overheal. The 2nd highest rank was more mana efficient because of this. That's all I know.
---
Isn't some [solution proposed by Blizzard](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5r821/big_news_internal_cooldown_added_on_layering/?sort=new), or did I misread?
---
Super accurate content, like making a bug report because Verdant the Everliving hit him too hard
---
Nice twist, 100% agreed.
---
Honestly, I think if I were to add dungeons, I would try and fill gaps.  Those gaps are:
---
* A low-level (i.e. 12-16 dungeon) for Alliance characters, possibly a barrow-dens in Darnassus, to make up for the lack of RFC.
---
* A low-ish (mid-20s) dungeon for Horde in either Thunder Bluff or Undercity, to make up for the lack of Stockades.
---
* A long mid-30s dungeon, something to act as a balance to the short-and-simple Scarlet Monastery.  I love SM, but man it takes a lot of runs to get any decent amount of XP.
---
* Something between Mara and ST
---
* Something between ST and BRD
---
&gt; So you are saying that a bit more BWL loot
---
"a bit more"  hilarious.  You got 5 months worth of progression in 1 month (which is if you're telling the truth about the time span you did it for, the fact that your dates and story are all over the place suggests you're not)
---
The original video was edited to remove the leg bug, so you won't find it on this subreddit. Basically, the little leg movements as you turn in place weren't displaying on this person's game for whatever reason, so his character was just spinning on the spot. I had never noticed this behavior and it wasn't in beta when I checked, so I figured I'd set the record straight.
---
You say that but my experience in the past w/o national servers suggests you could end up with a realm that's 50/50 English and another language.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dUSRkBwQdc8
---
&gt; They literally that this isn't how it's going to work lmao 
---
[Except that they literally have said that is one of the reasons for layering tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=281)
---
&gt; It's literally the same game being played on the same launch with the same pop how the fuck you think there's somehow going to be a different economy? That makes no sense at all. 
---
Ah yes, all conditions will obviously be the same between all realms. It's not like it's going to be a different mix of class, professions, playstyles, etc. How could there be differences between supplies of resources and demands of players?
---
As a class that fights NPCs in melee, you'll get crit 5-10% of the time usually so it happens with some regularity
---
It wasn't added until the achievement was added in 3.0.2
---
Wasn't me..

Honestly with how schools straight up allow phones I thought kids would just get an app onntheir phone for it instead of buying any more TI calculators.
---
I also played on Spirestone alliance and everyone called it dm.
---
I think this is horribly inaccurate but I'm not sure because how abysmally hard to read it is. And are you compiling how good each class is at wpvp, bgs, duels, and premades, all into one value? Because that is incredibly useless. You might as well factor pve raiding, leveling, and shoe size if you are going to be that broad.
---
Good on you for trying to contribute OC to a stale sub, but this needs some very heavy editing.
---
If only I had the gold to give.
---
its pretty common these days to put masterlooter on bosses when something is reserved.
---
Just because there was some consensus on forums in vanilla doesn't mean anything. At that time people didn't even know how to summon Ragnaros. You shouldn't hold that as gospel.   
---
The spirit thing is a bit of a meme but basically if you can get to 75 ish spirit you get nice regen because it pays off to stack it.   
---
But dual wield fury is absolutely not a good way to level.
---
As someone who can walljump and enjoys exploring with it; there are certain locations that should be fixed to prevent it. WSG is one of them, there are a few locations out in the world near quest hubs that should be fixed as well.
---
Troll Mage - Housewares
---
* Yes there's plenty of good 2handers. https://classicdb.ch/?item=2000 and WC staff is more than enough. These are both guaranteed.
---
* Yes you will get it around 34-38, which is fine.
---
* You hamstring kite...
---
&gt;In contrast, there are a bunch of awesome 1H weapons available as quest rewards (Wing Blade from WC, Outlaw Sabre from BFD, and, most importantly, Sword of Omen/Serenity from SM and Vanquisher's Sword from RFD). DW Arms actually works really well, and it's more fun than 2H because of the more steady rage generation and playstyle. I can't take credit for this idea, as I'm largely compiling from sources such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Dn6X2QIZg
---
WC blade is literally the same as the staff except you don't have to worry about offhand. BFD is a waste of time, Sword of omen/RFD weapon requires you to do 2 entire lvl40 dungeons, by this time you are guarenteed to have WW axe, or you can get bonebiter from SM alone and skip the trash dungeon that is RFD.
---
This didn't age well
---
Uhm...that last bit is really not true. In Hots, it is extremely important that the team is synched and work together. If just 1 player sucks, and feeds the other team, its pretty much gg since the other team will snowball that to a victory (due to the Team-Leveling mechanic, which is not present in other MOBA:s). Hots relies on team play to an extreme amount to the point of it being unplayable unless you happen to have a team of 5 players. 
---
This is also why Hots is so extremely frustrating to play solo, since you will be teamed up with retards who screw your team over time and time again and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. You can just watch your rank go down after a yet another hopeless defeat.
---
I used to play Hots ranked for a little while, but I've decided to never touch the game ever again. Its not healthy.
---
I‘d even be happy with only one server per language. Let it be PvE (or whatever). I have no statistics and no metrics but I am pretty sure that finding 3000-4000 players per language seems realistic, especially for languages spoken in more than one country. Might even be highly underestimated! Bare in mind that private server populations should not be used as a reliable metric as they are illegal and too fishy etc. for many players. We‘ll see in August. What do you think how many servers europe will be able to populate healthily? 
---
And yeah, about that teaming up and making unofficial realms: Of course I‘m on board but that’s just a workaround for a problem I don‘t think will exist. :)
---
I'd buy it.
---
BfA was already designed, INTENTIONALLY, to be the second to last Retail expansion.
---
This is why Blizzard didn't cared about BfA, because they decided, when they announced Classic that they WILL NOT RUN 2 MMOs.
---
And Retail WoW is the MMO that they will dump. It should be crystal clear by now that this is their intent.
---
They will NOT cancel it...just move it to MOBILE in 10.0.
---
9.0 will be EVEN WORSE than BfA. I was calling it since 2018, before even BfA went live.
---
9.0 will be so EASY, intentionally, to make it easier to move 10.0 to mobile.
---
&gt; and it could happen that only hunter items dropped while you had no hunter in the raid or group.
---
Every weapon is a Hunter weapon.
---
In the original closed WoW beta, I died in the Ungoro crater ape caves once.
---
I spawned at the spirit healer in Azshara.
---
Not kidding.
---
Anger Management actually gives you rage every second while you are in combat. It is superior to fury for rage gen really. Sure you get a bit more rage swinging w two weapons but you just miss your attacks constantly...
---
Turn your nameplates off next time.
---
World of Tanks and Dota mostly, little bit of XCOM: Enemy Within every now and then.
---
So three months after launch we all find out that, since Mankrik's Wife was the 'official' r/classicwow server, we all rolled on ZappyBoi.
---
I'll make sure to remember to make it perfect for you next time
---
This is exactly where I'm at. As someone who used to routinely break into AQ40 before it was released and run around in the empty instance, I love wall jump exploration. When it starts to negatively impact other players or the balance of the game, it needs to be changed.
---
I considered something like this but it feels more trouble than it's worth. I have hazy memories of guild bank currency systems based around resources, level, etc and it seems like a lot of hassle for something that's supposed to be beneficial.
---
Rogue, going herb/enchanting. It was the combo I used on a druid in wrath that worked well for me. I can trade some herbs for potions and flasks and sell the rest. This will help keep me afloat until I get enchanting up. Stealthing to bosses that I can solo or druid duo for enchanting mats.
---
I must question adding low level dungeons. The leveling experience is alright in terms od dungeons already. It's maxlevel that would eventually need new content. Puttinf ressources into adding dungeons that will be played maybe twice while leveling sounds odd
---
haha yeah because Blizzard never makes stupid decisions.
---
Is this a meme?
---
I'll be tanking during those weeks, but I don't especially care whether I'm tanking SM/Ulda or BRD/Strat/Scholo at the end of the first few weeks.
---
Rested XP from levelling an alt and earning some gold is. That will also make it easier to have some good pots for leveling and tanking.
---
I'm interested how you came to make a decision on this when taking into account several aspects of PvP. Some classes/specs excel in 1v1's but struggle with groups
---
Then I'll be that guy. Can't tell you how many times I've gone engineering. I don't care if it's "better". I'm bored of it.
---
Literally 0 schools allow you to use a cell phone for math exams or tests
---
pretty wrong too.
---
I'm not subscribing until there are gender neutral options
---
Flight paths were few and far in between, and "farm spots" were usually in very isolated an required a lot of travel.
---
The fact that you're only focusing on end game tells me you have very little experience in Classic. Dungeons, quests, and events are all around the world and require people to figure out how to get there, and leveling is such a long experience, countless players will spend the first 6 months. And none of these players will have the insanely convenient flight whistle to hop around the world.
---
Adding in that flight will eventually be added to BFA and, sorry, but it is comical to argue that they are the same experience.
---
I can't hear you over the noise of my sliderule.
---
So release is about 666 days after the announcement?
---
!remindme 7 days
---
But damage isn't the only stat in the game.  Damage taken is also a valuable thing to look at.  For a leveling pet, where the majority of the time you're solo (and a lot of the time in a 2- or 3-man group, your pet is the tank) your ability to take hits is as important as your ability to dish them.
---
If you're toggling between them based on whether or not there's a tank, you don't need a macro.
---
If someone else is tanking, then screech will still help.  It stacks with demo shout and demo roar.  While leveling, the slight loss in damage isn't that big of a deal.  Level variances will have a bigger impact than which pet family you have, and nobody is going to scoff at you for bringing a turtle to Scarlet Monastery.
---
If you're min/maxing at level 60, then you should have pets that are designed for DPS (like a Wolf, Wind Serpent, or Cat) instead of pets that are designed for solo tanking.  Owls fall behind all three of those.

I may not love the term, but it was popular back in vanilla.

There's a lot I could address here, but I'll just say this; Improved Overpower is NOT a power talent. It never has been, it never will be. Each point in the talent is worth at most 2% dps. It is not worth building your character around it.
---
It's ironic that in the same video that makes fun of warriors for being all "I want to get BIG CRITZ with MY AXE!" he promotes a build based around overpower, which is exactly that same notion. It's flashy and impressive, but overall it's just a tiny little bump in performance.

playing Squad right now. its the best fps ive ever played. its a very tactical, realistic online shooter. i love that it forces you to play with a mic because the game is so tactical. everyone in-game uses a mic and communicates, love it.

---
This subreddit is a real circlejerk
---
Do you wanna know why they introduce layering and only english servers?
---
Money.
---
There is a boss that came to the conclusion that various servers are nearly empty and therefore cost more than they produce.
---
So they want to find a way to adjust it so theres not one penny lost in server costs.
---
Its common nowadays and not only in the gaming industry. Those are companies that change, adjust so everything fits but exactly to this reason do they even loose more money due to the lost customers. Then they will rise prices and loose more and more.
---
The public transport in my country is another perfect example for this phenomenon.
---
What i keep asking myself is how stupid they can be even after visiting so many economic schools.
---
Bad news, that means that they seriously want to have Layering on Release. But they can't be that retarded to have it active more than 1 or two days.
---
That can be the answer to literally every post in this thread.  It's a killjoy answer that removes all possibility of discussion from the thread.

Glitching under Karazhan is harmless. Gaining an advantage in PvP through broken game geometry is not. Historically, Blizzard hasn't been very sympathetic to exploits that negatively impact other people's game experience.
---
They had it planned but was scrapped as the guy is there. It wasn't added until patch 3.2

Apex legends. Might try to level my horde on bfa, but I doubt it will hold my interest.

Season 2 of apex legends is coming and that’s where I’ll be at.

I don't think they're keeping it, just adjusting It so guilds aren't abusing it on day one
---
Age of mythology
---
And about three times the number of people.  There will be an advantage for people on the least populated layer I guess.  For example if there are two full 3k player layers, and one with only 1000, those 1000 will find mats easier.
---
I really want to play the WC3 campaign again and finish it before Classic. However, since Reforged is allegedly being released this year I want to save the campaign for that....so not sure what to do here.
---
his creativity would be smothered within the first weeks.  He would live in a Dilbert strip.
---
Are you talking about pservers or beta? I noticed this on ndale but couldn't remember it ever happening during Vanilla. Wasn't sure if it was me misremembering or not.
---
Stress test for classic
---
It still hurts but I think it's different than in the other games where bot lane dies three times and now their carry is stacked early or whatever. Hots you can chill and soak for your team, and whatever they did when they changed XP around means if you can manage a teamfight win you're almost immediately on even footing again.
---
All this makes a worse Serious Competitive eSport but a better casual experience. I never bother with ranked, just unranked draft. If I was going to dump time into improving and taking a game seriously, I would want a game where my personal performance mattered more. That's why I play fighting games if I'm trying to be serious, it's a shame people don't connect with 1v1 games as much as these 5v5 things. (or at least more games that are 2v2 or 3v3, where you can reasonably have a team of just your friends pretty easily)
---
Again, when it comes to these games I'm a filthy casual nowadays so my opinions are probably wrong. Hots still fun though.
---
Great way to go classic+
---
basically right, but better to use 4.5?m as the paid sub and box buyer number.  nearly half of 'subs' were in china with The9 - no box sales, no subscriptions per se.

When will you people understand that you were never going to get an EXACT recreation of vanilla wow. It is not the same game, and never was going to be. You guys harp on this #nochanges meme over and over, but none of you are intellectually consistent enough to stick to "nochanges" completely. You all cherry pick what changes you are okay with. Just stop.

In other words. 1v1 tier list. Yeah there is no way shadow priests are considered top tier when it comes to BGs/premades

I agree it will be a mess and it will suck.  I feel the dev is taking the road with the least casualties by giving the majority of players the best of a bad situation.  Can you agree one situation that won't occur with the current proposal is having under populated or ghost town realms in the middle and long term?

&gt; PSA customer feedback is integral to making a product the customer wants.  I know this blows your mind so I'm here to help.
---
This is the sort of toxic repartee that developers have to sift through to get to people that actually have a fucking point.
---
&gt; Where was Blizzard before the community outcry to play classic? They were losing droves of subscribers in most Post Wotlk expansions.
---
And do you have a reason why? No. Blizzard does. And I would bet a good chunk of that is simply a matter of the playerbase getting older and moving to different life stages (having careers and families) or simply moving on from the game. Wrath was *11 years ago*. A lot changes in a decade. Blizzard also had their own changes as staff came and went over the years. Naturally, the game innovated and changed. Some things worked, others did not, but they tried.
---
WoW retail already looks like it's a phone game that could have been released on Android several years ago. It looks like it is standing still compared to competing MMOs.
---
&gt; It took years of driven community "yelling" to get here.
---
And finding out how to get a hold of 15 year old code and make it work in a modern engine within a subscription model that wouldn't fragment the player population horribly.
---
It's also a matter of do you continue the product as you have planned, making corrections and updates of course. Or do you shovel it away and let the loud masses tell you how to run it. Blizzard found a way to do both recently.

---
i still always end up in a lonely tree or some bones or something
---
Not your server merging is the main reason.
---
Btw. Anyone ever thought about what they do about this layering if the servers are still full after phase 1/2?
---
I can imagine that a split will be way more messy than a little merge
---
No, that's just EU (minus Russia). Americas + Oceania has roughly 9% more players total and the breakdown is:
---
* 83.75% North America (English)
---
* 8.05% Oceania
---
* 4.91% Latin America (Spanish)
---
* 3.28% Brazilian (Portuguese)  
---
So it's pretty clear that even Australia won't be getting their own realms. Like South and Central America for all of Retail (and now Classic), the realms they connect to will be hosted in Los Angeles under the "NA West" banner.
---
The timezone breakdown for North America is:
---
* 22.55% Pacific
---
* 3.99% Mountain
---
* 27.52% Central
---
* 29.69% Eastern
---
This is a tougher decision, but you only have two host locations: Chicago and Los Angeles. Since all of Oceania, Latin America, and Brazil will be connecting to US West realms, it makes it much higher.
---
So if EU gets 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP realms, it's very likely that:
---
US Pacific gets 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP realms.
---
US East gets 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP realms.
---
The rest get nothing.
---
sure pservers are different scaled in terms of exp gain through quests etc. but 5-6 days is doable if you got the time and a plan for mage aoe grinding or a good quest path as a hunter
---
but i doubt it will be average for the whole playerbase but more for dedicated people who want to get to endgame quick
---
Yeah but there are 3 times the demand too.
---
Did this all the way up to cataclysm
---
Can someone ELI5 this for me? I missed what it is and why were mad about it.
---
"Johnson! Did you roll out the battleground geometry fix?"
---
"Well yeah, it was basically cheating."
---
"You FOOL! Do you have any idea what you've done? Now we have to add Azerite armor and achievements!"
---
"But why-"
---
"We HAVE to."
---
PVE it doesnt matter much as none of the racials really come into play except for orc pet damage in dungeons maybe. In raids you wont have a demon.
---
In pvp orc is best imo because your biggest enemy is stuns and orc stun racial is OP. Undead get WotF but warlock trinket already removes fear iirc and alliance typically has a much lower density of warlocks due to the perceived notion that WotF just hard counters ally locks.
---
Maybe, the point for me is that ive zero trust in a free bugs/exploits layering system.
---
I'm still waiting on my dance studio /s
---
Undead is better both for PvE and PvP really. I’m rolling troll myself, and you can make a case for it for pvp (hex of weakness and ofc shadowguard + blackout), but overall UD seems like a more solid choice. Berserking doesn’t benefit you in pve, tho hasted MC and mana burn seems sweet
---
While I do miss my old guild. I’ve also realised how easy it was to just randomly join and get to know them in such little time. 
---
I’ll definitely spend a lot of time and thought shopping for a new one. 
---
I can’t wait for my first 40man tho
---
It was fresh. Jube'thos or however it's spelled. He was first 60 followed closely by a warlock who was 58 at time of record.  
---
No respectable speed running curator would put original Vanilla and Classic in the same bracket.
---
if you give a serv to all languages sure, but main ones should be split... Cause minorities WILL pick english cause they're used to it, but if they end up on a french or german server they'll be fucked.
---
to be fair you can fly almost anywhere.
---
They have already talked about the possibility, it was your standard "if the demand is there" answer but it doesn't eliminate the possibility at least
---
With or without dynamic spawns?
---
it will
---
It was vc on ysondre (us) in 2004-2005
---
Orc
---
yeah i doubt new players will notice as long as the cooldown is like 5+ minutes
---
I still think a cooldown of like ever 1-2 hours unless you are in a rest zone would be best. and have rest zones be 1 layer at all times
---
The block value is pretty huge, it increases your shield slam damage which is your main threat generator and the return damage proc is quite nice. You can keep draconian deflector for the fire resist. 10 def is like a bit over 1% avoidance total. 2% block chance is great.   
---
Its a threat upgrade mainly, not a big mitigation upgrade. Its cute you still think defense is like super good, but its really not.
---
There are a lot of people that specifically want that huge population experience though. I'll be able to shamble leisurely through starter areas any time for the next however many years, there will only ever be one true launch day.

---
Good quality post ty
---
I think that your suggestion might get some traction.  Would you agree, it will probably face a problem of four servers underpopulated and one server overpopulated?  
---
I see three big pressure on players to pick English realms over another native language.  One is that many people may avoid non English servers, since there are a lot of long term subscribing players that want to raid on English servers since they do/will have higher quality raiding guilds.  There may not be enough English servers to prevent long queue times for the realm if your proposal precisely creates one, or two of each type tagged as English.  Lastly, I don't think there will be enough long term players to populate five RP-PVE servers with one per language.  
---
I do disagree that players of another language are unable to play with other players.  Many times you can group with someone and never speak a word and carry on at a high performance level.  It would be higher and less prone to mistakes.  
---
I think also, even having other players in the world that you do not interact with gives a better feeling when playing wow, than having that player absent and on a language specific server.
---
That means half the guide is thinking ahead, and the other half doesn't work on real servers, so you are left with nothing to do in the early phases, which leaves a lot of people missing this entire thing, since the guide will be forgotten by then.
---
I know its fun to think ahead, have banks and whatnot and stockpile resources ahead of patch progression and stuff, that's how private server people made the big bucks, but I think the guide should focus on how to make money post-launch, since they posted it 2 months in advance.
---
I'm not missing the point, I know how to make gold in this game, I just think this way, not because I'm ignorant, but because I'm being realistic, regular joes aren't goblins.
---
I will stand by that point.
---
I have hazy memories of struggle to get through bottlenecks created by shortages, and then having to go back to other zones to collect resources.  I'm hoping this will end that or reduce it.
---
You cite the lack of good 2handers between DM and whirlwind axe as one of the main reasons to go dw instead of 2h. This is such a strange argument, considering the 1handed weapons you go on to list instead. Specifically you list Vanqs sword and sword of serenity/omen. These are both weapons that come AFTER ww axe, even on a fresh launch server where you won't be able to do ww axe at lvl 30 (both of these require you to be around lvl 38). Heck, you could even pick Bonebiter right then and there and make this argument null.
---
Ok but this is classic WoW and this is what people have been asking for. It adds another level to the PvP, and makes for fun quirky experiences. That's all I was arguing for so I'm not sure why you are replying to this comment thread if you don't care about those things? Maybe you just didn't care to read anything I wrote which is on you.
---
My point was that it adds a new layer of skill being able to predict and waste the enemy's CD, and his was that you can merely REACT to it which is not possible.
---
Ceiling, vent, cobweb... That's it for me.

Sending pictures of yourself naked is perfectly respectable, that's why mothers would hide it from their teenage children, or avoid telling their parents, and it apparently counts as privileged information that causes a backlash when guys make a facial recognition search engine to find out if their partner ever did a porno.
---
I was one of those people who wasnt really that excited to play classic I thought I would be bored and not really enjoy it and it was overhyped. I resubbed to play classic for something to do for a few days and was immediately proven wrong when I couldn't stop playing now it's the only game I can think about playing. I played from wotlk to legion with some breaks and have no interest at all in bfa
---
I AM PLAYING ON PRIVATE SERVERS!!! XD

---
The most cited advantage is paladins in raids and pre-made BGs.
---
Honestly they should have released this 1 month earlier but 8.2 was scheduled so i guess thats the reason we will get it at the end of August. Sucks
---
But it doesn’t have to be doomsday level dramatic, it just has to be high volume. People are really going after Blizzard’s credibility for this, which I think ultimately damages the community relationship with Blizzard
---
Yeah, let's jump around desperately looking for the invisible corner of BG geometry we can stand on while we're being feared and rooted and fighting for our lives, that's a totally reasonable response to this problem. Maybe I should look up a wall jumping video and ignore my BG until I figure out how to get up there, makes perfect sense.
---
You must realize your position of "I'm able to do it so it's right" is completely indefensible. It's cheating, plain and simple.
---
Yeah I agree when tanking for small groups the armor from carrion bird is quite nice. When solo I tend to value damage more as it means more threat and faster kills, so less damage taken as well.
---
For sure at 60 those pets are all better options than owl.
---
What four slots dropped? I only know of old blanchys feed bag and that’s from quest on alliance, I think the same item from horde quest in razor hill, but I have only ever seen six slot bags drop from monsters in the beginning zones.
---
Don't get me wrong, I find it sickening that OCE wouldn't get a server. 200 ms based gameplay is shit, and I'm glad we get a server at all, but even so you could consider adding just two servers to allow for those languages to get their server, be it just one type like PvP and not PvE. 
---
Basing this on numbers will lead to several other problems, I find it lazy af and it will leave a lot of people pretty salty. It's easy to consider this fine when you're on NA servers cause it's normalized, but EU had to adopt english for FPS's or LoL or whatever for the longest time. WoW was a safe haven in that regard, and now it's changing to this normalized bullshit. So regardless of numbers, it's definitely gonna cause some trouble.

Oh just great, now my 7 different layering posts I had planned for the day are useless, gg Blizzard :(
---
Is there a legal way to increase the resolution in D2? I remember I tried playing it but it looked so bad on my screen. And I don't know much about computers, might be a stupid question.
---
Why would there be a different mix of class professions playstyles etc? It's literally random servers there's no reason to think that layer A) is gonna be different from layer B).
---
Also this clip doesn't say at all that the amount of players per layer is going to be altered according to needs.
---
nah
---
There are no VC "heretics," it was actually called VC on a lot of servers.
---
Things can have multiple names. Nobody is actually confused by what is meant by either VC or DM.
---
I'll be calling it VC once classic launches just to weed out the morons who think this crap matters.
---
&gt;You are letting fear and what if’s sway your opinion.
---
What else is there to do on Reddit though?
---
I will agree with larkonath on this one, The % of people doing that stuff is very very minor, you overestimate the populous.
---
Most people are going to be new or back again, not private server hardcore players that abuse layering to its fullest, and even then a lot of them wont be doing this regardless, because of the fact that its an abuse. (Que morals, obligations and etiquette)
---
&gt; It's as important as end game content (raids) itself.
---
Layering wont take place end game, that is all I have to say about that, the long term economy will stabilize accordingly when layering is removed.
---
People will simply wait for the deep dive in prices after layering is gone and people start to dump their savings, then smart people start buying again.
---
Layering shouldn’t be a thing in the first place.
---
Yes but a shaman is significantly cooler than a paladin, objectively speaking, so I'd really consider the lack of shaman to be a greater disadvantage
---
Nope. Go with what you like best. Female nelfs make the best priests in terms of class fantasy imo.
---
The spec specific listings doesn't allow for any hybridization.  No elemetal mage, no hybrid resto-balance druid, no differentiation between hemo-CB, prep daggers, and pure sub, etc.  
---
In terms of retarded rankings:  
---
BM hunters bottom tier as "challenging and rewarding"
---
Fury warriors below enhance shamans
---
Assa rogues bottom tier
---
UD and gnome over orc for warlock
---
holy priest above disc or hpaladin in pvp
---
wtf is a pure arcane mage?  I assume that means arcane fire, but then why is arcane fire bottom tier compared to pure fire being top tier, so since that makes no since that means it is suppose to be like a 51pt arcane mage ranking?  Somehow that is above BM hunter, wtf.
---
Where'd you get the varian pic? That's my king right there
---
I don't pay any attention to streamers, so I have no clue who you're talking about. Somebody trying hard at a game doesn't justify cheating. 
---
I'll admit the image of some obnoxious streamer getting tilted at a battleground is really funny, but this bug affects everyone. It's unfun and boring, and that's not what people are looking for in WoW.
---
How has no one mentioned front flipping for NE? Literally BiS Jump throughout all of classic, you'll never replace it.
---
&gt; Remember that release is two months away, but the layering problem has been like this since beta was first released. 
---
Literally less than one and a half month ago, you guys talk like it's been like this for the past year.
---
Swifty was an OG Vanilla WoW God.  He's still streaming and playing a warrior in retail if I'm not mistaken.  Pretty sure he knows how to do the wall jumps, but like the rest of us, wants it out of the game because it was not an intended feature of Warsong.  In fact, I thought by the time 1.12 released, these exploits had been removed from Warsong.  Am I wrong, and if not, why are they still there?
---
I wager that gold will still be more valuable than it was in TBC, even accounting for natural leveling inflation from 60 to 70. However, it's still going to be far less valuable than it was in actual vanilla, without a doubt. To an extent that was always gonna be the case, as good farming spots are already known and information is more easily available (one of the reason that practically nobody used DM farming is precisely because people were protective of good farming spots).
---
But actually there's a limit on just how much knowledge of good farming spots is even able to affect the economy, simply due to the limited availability of them. If everyone goes to a good spot, it's gonna be overpopulated and it's gonna suck. So then people naturally spread out, and try to find farming spots that aren't quite as good, but at least are empty, thus still yielding more gold than the "best" farming spot.
---
This doesn't apply to instance farming. It can support any number of players. If the best farming spot is then also instance farming, then that just means that tons of people are going to be doing that. It makes gold easier to acquire and even reduces the variety of the game, as you needn't think about what farming spot is good based on e.g. server economy/time of day/professions etc., instead you just go to DM and make it rain gold.
---
IMO, there's just no positives whatsoever to allowing instance farming to be so strong.
---
Not sure what you need supermacro for, but because that classic use modern api and thus modern macro commands, I doubt there is any need for supermacro anymore.
---
DM = Deadmines.
---
VC = Deadmines.
---
Everybody understand this. They're both fine. This is the stupidest thing to be an elitist moron over, and that's saying something in the context of WoW.
---
So awesome that a class lets you do both :)
---
For female dwarf in particular, I think a lot of them are ironic picks.  That wasn't something someone seemingly ever did with their first character.  I legit remember 1 female dwarfs in vanilla on my server.
---
Everyone not named Mage/Hunter/Druid. Even then they could still use it (I'm not OP, just my opinions)
---
Basically, do you have movement or CC issues? You need Engineering.
---
In all the years I've played classic whether it be retails initial release, or years on private realms, I don't think I've ever killed Cookie before VanCleef.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure you can just go Into the in game options, video settings and you get 1080p.
---
Who?
---
You should keep the skill, this was a change in patch 1.11
---
Why not add languages to the most used types then, like PvP ? If there's like 3 PvP servers, why not add 2 specifically for german and french for example? But also, imagine doing RP as someone who doesn't speak the language. You wouldn't mind having the world be quieter if you knew you could have more than 5% of people speaking your language. All servers will be dominated by english and minorities who don't speak it, what then?
---
Your example is weird, cause Classic is precisely the occasion to get some of that community sense back. You speak with people, you enjoy interaction, it's not retail. 
---
What if you're raid leading on discord? You'll have a guild speaking your own language, else it's impossible to lead everyone if they don't speak the language right? So guilds will be community based anyway... We'll just have clans instead of servers... I don't see the point

Yes, clearly I know nothing about the match up.  Because in a glass cannon fight it's the guy with two instant cast forms of CC that will lose.  Clearly.  How could I have made that mistake.  /s
---
Throwing out a large heal and popping back into shadowform doesn't leave a priest manaless.  It does mean the mage doesn't burst them down during their counterspell window.
---
Also, no, locking out one school of a class with multiple schools doesn't automatically win a fight.  That's not true of any caster.  Go back to the drawing board and come up with something that isn't nonsense.
---
You don't even know how counterspell works, so who doesn't know what now?
---
A few hundred a pop? Someone like LMGD managed 20k gold before the end of phase 1, he used it all on the PvP Climb to rank 14. (You can hear him talking about this during the rogue deep-dive that tipsout did.)

A few hundred gold for a couple of pets isn't gonna make a dent into real gold making strats.

i can only get so hard

It was DM on Dalaran US. Although, a side note. While we recruited for it as DM, we has a level 60 warrior on our server that used to Chill in Westfall and ask for invites when we'd be building groups using westfall general. He'd leave shortly after stating "Oh, I thought this was for Dire Maul"
---
I'd say the rogue/pala combo is close to the warr/pala comp. What I mean by that is that it is broken. The pally can freedom the rogue give AP buff etc. Also if the rogue speccs combat he basically becomes a warr with some cc and survivability. I'd say for pvp its a godcomp and for pve/lvling its also really good.
---
There are quite a few reasons I don't agree with this post. 
---
- "Getting one of your stuns resisted can mean to difference between life and death for you as a druid." What a laughable comment.  It would really justify apply to bear form, which is probably a form a minority of druids will be in while wandering the world past 20.  While orcs have probably my favorite racials, I have never seen one and gone "ohh, he will resist my stun, what do I do? " 
---
- The 5% to HP is to base HP (not to total) (https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=200094).  I suspect strength is the same, but the difference is laughably small early.
---
- the starting zones are absolutely in favor of Alliance.  I have leveled 8 druids, and I cannot stress this enough.  I had 4 horde druids 50-60 before making my first Alliance druid, and without knowing the quests, I beat my 1-20 time on alliance.  Subsequent druids maintained even faster times, and every 10 levels was consistently faster than my horde attempts despite not knowing the quests as I progressed.  I think it simply comes down to travel time in the zones, as one is compact and organized, there other is a Diaspora of quests in the barrens.
---
- gear is better on horde side, but I don't think your examples are what I would have chosen.  There biggest difference to me are weapons.  I think the horde gets better weapons earlier, in particular a green 2h mace with a bunch of strength comes to mind.  Rings are more abundant early for the horde, too, through questing.  I tended to have two rings quite early on horde, and I might have to wait until closer to 30 on alliance. 
---
- that being said, alliance has great catch-up mechanisms, namely deadmines.  The blue mace, ring and cloak are easily obtained, the XP from the quests makes it very compatible with speed leveling (I tend to run with my guild for launch, so they are speed runs), and druids can tank, heal or DPS competitively.  The VC questline leads to stockades, which is devoid of great drops, but can be done under 30 minutes, and nets over 12000 XP and a stunning druid ring that easily makes up for the late acquisition.  
---
- saying alliance don't have to go against shamans completely ignores is not having to go against paladins.  All those beautiful HoTs just disappear, and you will be lucky to kill them with bubbles and BoPs.  You can outrun then b pretty easily, which is what I tended to just do in world PvP.  Shamans with try frost shock to keep that from happening, but it is easy to shift, heal, and shift again.  Like orcs, I have never seen a shaman and thought "I don't know what to do"
---
- really the hardest part of not rolling a tauren is lack of war stomp for emergency healing.  It is so nice to be able to cancel an animal for, stomp and get an emergency heal off.  You can break spells early on before the animal forms, stop heals... It is the far superior racial.  I use meld to simply eat without risk of being seen.
---
Those were my initial thoughts reading this.  If someone really doesn't know how to choose between the two, my advice would be to pick what you want as an endgame goal. If it is to raid endgame, I think Alliance had an easier task with paladins and their blessings.  That isn't too say there won't be great horde raiding guilds.  They will have their own benefits, such as poison cleansing totems on huhuran that works much better  than alliance abolish poison from druids.
---
Damn really? I didnt play classic so i didnt know. I just thought it was always around. What a bummer!
---
It's kinda funny because of how controversial Trial of the Crusader was when it released.
---
I clicked and read a few of the replies, amazing.
---
People actually complaining that since they are fixing people’s complaints about layering that must mean they want to keep layering for as long as they can.
---
People are actually complaining about complaints getting fixed. Holy shit.
---
Maybe it's obvious, but it's best not to out people on the internet if you can avoid it. I figured I would appreciate the effort if the situation was reversed, and none of my teammates consented to having their names publicly shared. Editing out all names seemed like the best option.
---
I'll probably play for ~12ish hours on launch night, and I took the week off from work so I'm not worried about being "ahead of the pack."  I'll accomplish that by sheer time.  My goal for the first night will be to level as much as I can and create the rest of my characters to lock in their names, since I have them picked out for every class.
---
Alternatively "The Goonies ft Van Cleef"
---
Im pretty passive, but when you have a racial ability to literally eat your enemy's corpse you kind of just buy into the role. Nothing better than winning a good fight and going cannibalize on them.
---
I understand your point but competing with thousands upon thousands of people for the few mobs there are around is very very frustrating. I believe they are making a smart move with layering and I have trust in these guys
---
Again. If most people use DM farming as an income they are gonna need to buy from other players. Enchants, consumables, gear etc.
---
Since most people are off farming DM, the players who farm other spots will be able to sell their loot for a higher price since the resource is scarce.
---
It balances out, which makes it less of a problem. Not a problem at all, if you ask me.
---

I’m stuck between choosing shaman and warlock with one major factor left, in large scale PvP like alterac do my totems only effect those in my party or are they in a aoe, I don’t want to play shaman and be in a push at bridge in AV and have the people in my party off doing side objectives or who knows where and my totems not be buffing anyone
---
I originally leveled a Hunter to 30 before switching to warlock for 60 levels. Finally did a priest as my last 60 in vanilla. druid became my main for tbc - wotlk
---
theramore or gadgetzan
---
I just found mine too! And the one for wotlk
---
Human Rogue, I just hated those purple priests.
---
Whatever you want.
---
Horde you should put it in badlands ofc 
---
for ally I usually put it in feralas to get to DM faster since that's the longest trip of any and you aoe farm there so why not.
---
silithus once 1.8/1.9 is out, and EPL once 1.11 is out.
---
&gt; upfront without proof that this may be necessary in the first place
---
Fortunately for the majority of wow classic long term players, you are not running the wow classic team.  The proof would be from numbers they have internally for hours played, number of characters, and the realm.  If you wanted to have first hand proof, it would require a lot of hours of work on your part.  To be diligent and put forth a lot of effort, you could comb through archives of auction house data for realms to get a similar picture of the metrics, since active players post auctions to make gold.
---
It is an inevitable result that the player base will decline and log out when no new content comes and/or the next phase or patch is far off in the distance.  I'm not talking about tourists leaving after launch hype dies down.  I'm talking about consistent subscribers getting bored and putting their dollars and hours into other more fun activities outside of wow.  Those long periods will additionally draw more people off medium and low pop realms to high pop realms, which actually compounds those lower pop problems even more.  
---
It has occurred that way since, ever even before wow on other MMOs and online FPS servers.  More and more people congregate to the most popular scene to play and interact.  There are a lot of forces that make the case that few servers with many layers and many long term players for the launch is the best route to take.  That is in line when looking at the trend of active Warcraft server population from '04 to '19.
---
I personally really enjoyed that! Getting the deathless/wipeless achievement is one of my greater accomplishments in WoW lol
---
They aren’t scaled any differently. XP gains from both quests and mobs are identical when compared with the popular vanilla servers.
---
Draconian Deflector is a downgrade from Drillborer Disk, and defense while being a primary tanking stat is almost always the least valuable tanking stat in the game.
---
Too funny, I am playing this too. Just finished last night! Grats on clearing O&amp;S, they are rough.
---
If someone kills themselves because they heard a suicide joke, they'd probably also kill themselves if they stubbed their toe.  Sorry, I'm not going to walk on egg shells to make sure some oversensitive nitiwt can't handle an obvious joke about a ham-fisted bot on Reddit.  You're the kind of person that would petition the government to ban sad music because it might "make" someone kill themselves.  Get a grip.
---
I think the best thing they could do with expanding itemization is introduce gear pieces that allow certain specs to be viable. For example, all Feral really needs to be viable as MT/dps in raids are staves that increase attack power in bear/cat form like they introduced in TBC.
---
Debating on my class, race, and gender still. 
---
I will be playing alliance for sure, have narrowed it down to these 3 so far. 
---
M/F Human Mage
---
M Dwarf Hunter
---
F Night Elf Hunter
---
You are typically always going to have one main tank and one main off-tank. These will be your most geared, constant tanks. Most fights will require some type of swap, or at minimum you will want a back up in case you lose your tank. You would be talented as if you were the main tank, have resistance sets, etc. 
---
There will be various other off-tanks who hop in for specific encounters with lots of adds, but these may not even be specced to tank depending on how long they have to maintain their add.
---
Yo make a stop in your high 20s in Ashenvale and join my squad. Unless you're horde in which case... Get off my lawn!
---
That's the only way things get done with Blizzard. Rational discussion is ignored. They only respond to a huge outcry.
---
Reminds me of the past hour of Nost 
---
https://youtu.be/TiIBg3yzkiY

You made a bad attempt at “humor” bro - instead of accepting you just ain’t that funny, you lash out and call people about liking wow too much, while being on a wow exclusive sub... 
---
Like just stop man.
---
Lv 10 on my main
---
The remastered version feels pretty good. I picked it up last week on sale. Not sure if the sale is still going though.
---
Sure.
---
What's not required:
---
"ACTIVISON HAS KILLED CLASSIC! ILL BE GOING BACK TO PRIVATE SERVERS. IMAGINE ACTUALLY BELIEVING BLIZZARD IS GOING TO FIX THIS. BLIZZARD SHILLS DEFENDING LAYERING."
---
\^ That's been in pretty much every thread complaining about layering in the last few weeks.
---
Even some of us in the nochanges crowd don't want this.  In fact, I thought that by the time 1.12 was out, this wasn't possible anymore, or if you were caught doing it, you'd have your account banned for a couple of days or something like that.  Obviously it was a long time ago, but by the end of Vanilla, I don't remember this happening anymore.  That being said, if it does stay in the game, EVERYONE will know how to do it within a month or so of battlegrounds being active.  I remember when people first started doing this and it was just annoying and caused games to go on for much longer than they needed to.
---
I can tell you why my guild quit in cata and it wasn't aging out.  Do you even know vanilla average ages?  This age you think where people leave wow doesn't add up to the data.
---
There were code hurdles for sure but they had 1.12 data the whole time they didn't have to find it.  You seem very illinformed.  The reason they gave was they didn't want to go backwards.  The logistics are obviously a challenge but it was never the reason they weren't doing it.  They needed to see the playerbase was here to make it worth it.  But before that  they just were choosing not to pursue it.
---
What a waste of a perfectly good beta access , lemme know if you get tired of it ;) ;)
---
You can win a teamfight in Hots against an enemy team who is two or more lvls higher than yours if you are lucky and manage to catch one of their players seperately from the others. Your team might then get boosted back. Most of the time, however, your team will be crushed in the fight.
---
Yes, stay away from ranked and play casually. Better that way. And I also played on the EU servers, which are infested with Russian kids who do not speak a word of English and just go twin-blade Varian every match. The situation is probably better in the NA region.
---
Yeah there were no titles besides the special titles (scarab lord) or PvP titles in classic.
---
Was expecting the BFA Quest reward to be a slot machine.
---
I played a Feral Tank in Vanilla.  Started Druid day 1 and played all the way until the end of TBC. 
---
Feral Tanks are certainly very viable offtanks in raids, and for some bosses you can be a pretty decent main tank.  
---
The good news is that your gear is fairly straightforward - there aren't very many good tanking items for each slot before you start raiding, so gearing up is fairly straight forward.  You can also pick up a couple of good pieces early in MC (see: Medallion of Steadfast Might).  You should almost always be focusing on mitigation, but you also want to make sure you are generating enough threat to hold aggro.  Taladril's list and guide are probably the most helpful thing for this entire topic.
---
You aren't a viable main tank because you are always susceptible to getting crit and crushing blows against you.  I was the best geared feral druid on my server, and my guild tried to let me MT a lot, but sometimes the RNG gods just kill you.  I recall dying in a couple of seconds to bosses like Ragnaros or Nefarion.  You pull up the combat log and it's just like 
---
CRIT 
---
CRUSHING BLOW
---
No amount of healing can help you with that.  Your advantage as a druid is that your armor is very high and your health pool can also be quite large.  So in general you are pretty easy to heal, but you may get large spikes against tough hitting mobs that are unpreventable.
---
RFK is a lvl 28-33 instance roughly. Surely you cant be there the first day?
---
&gt;  the people who own wow now are physically incapable of improving it
---
I don't buy it. Blizzard drastically changed wow several times intentionally, to keep the experience fresh and to experiment. "Finishing" Vanilla in Classic wouldn't offer the same pitfalls whatsoever. I am fully convinced Blizzard could melt our brains with awesomeness if they were allowed to slowly but surely complete their vision of what Vanilla was supposed to, without detracting from the experience.
---
Zelda on emulators and the switch
---
If you want to think I'm lying, go for it, I don't need to validate myself to you. You're a clown. Instead of just accepting you were talking out of your ass and moving on, you're trying to find something to validate your nonsense. I'm done talking to you, go circle-jerk with someone else.
---
Gold in BFA is basically just there to help you buy transmogs, that's why no one cares about wow tokens in retail.  
---
In Classic, gold can make you extremely influential to your server's community
---
it's how classic was announced. Classic wow is commonly referred to as 'vanilla'. Out of nowhere Jay Allen Brack who was presenting the wow piece at blizzcon two years ago started talking about 'ice cream flavours' and people went absolutely crazy as they worked out what he was building up to. It was pretty cool :)
---
No accurate calculator without seeing boss armor values, etc.  Private server data is corrupted by having a misunderstanding of how hit functioned in relationship to +weaponskill.  My understanding is the correct classic formula has a lower cap on weaponskill, but actually increases the value of your 5 weaponskill.  
---
For **fury dps it is on the order of 6-8% better** for raiding in blue gear.  Math gets hard because rage return values are not 100% known.  You can mitigate that somewhat with some super expensive gloves, edgemasters, but you spend ~1000g on the gloves but you lose the stats from the glove slot to wear them.  Early on not major, but later tiers you are losing more and more stats to keep up that weapon skill.  
---
**For a tank** it is a larger gap, and you can't practically wear edgemaster's.  **9-12% threat difference**.  Slight reduction on incoming damage as you will parry haste the boss less.
---
My biggest dream is for wow to take the OSRS mantle and put out content and updates for the classic wow universe
---
I think this'll be everyone in a year, when we've all (albeit slowly) chewed our way through most of the content and fewer people bother logging on.
---
It was planned but got scrapped very early.
---
In the game manual the layout of grim batol entrance was completely different suggesting it was indeed in instance  [https://i.gyazo.com/0b2f64e642d7d84fc0b576d79e6cfa58.png](https://i.gyazo.com/0b2f64e642d7d84fc0b576d79e6cfa58.png)

If two populations are kept separate from one another, they will diverge. Realms economies were all different in vanilla, it's already been shown to be true.
---
But it allows for it, which is the point I was making. That combined with the fact that they have been [testing to determine what the ideal starting area population is](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/stress-test-details-june-19/201818), creates a strong indication that they are looking for a target to aim for.
---
Where would you put your talent points instead of Imp. OP? 
---
Overpower is your highest priority skill and the best dps/rage you have and the talent is an increase to this.
---
&gt;Each point in the talent is worth at most 2% dps. It is not worth building your character around it just to bump it from 1,7% to 2%.
---
Where do you get these numbers from? I don't believe they are true at all.
---
Err, shoot.  The one under Org.  RFC I mean.
---
Hitboxes certainly aren't. Hence all the private server players suddenly surprised at the size of Tauren hitbox on classic.
---
Jesus that run looks so bad I’d make an alt...
---
yeah I would think so
---
Yea it's amazing how many people don't know this one. 
---
DRUIDS DON'T ATTACK OTHER DRUIDS, DAMNIT
---
Any healer/melee combo is pretty good.  Rogues generally are more of a soloing class though so he won't do much to benefit you other then the pure damage.
---
It doesn't work like that in Classic. Spawning at the GY while when dying outside RFK/RFD as alliance is a private server thing.
---
Also Revantusk Trolls, although they are just converted to Darkspear rep by 1.12 so not really relevant for Classic.
---
First time I was charged by a Tauren Warrior that started off screen I’m pretty sure I screamed. I then was dead before I knew it and someone in party chat wrote “Wow! He’s got an Arcanite Reaper!”.
---
Honestly, I would rather see people getting scammed for trying to buy gold than play a version of classic where spending $1000 in wow tokens makes me the richest player on my server.
---
So why does the conversation always goes:
---
Hey layering is not perfect and has problems but it is the best we have .
---
NOOOOO, Multi server is the best. PERIOD. 
---
I yet to see anyone on the multi server side point out at least one negative point and yet layering the the "worst thing ever and will destroy everything"
---
Trolls and Gnomes are the only ones without a pvp faction
---
Crater of Azshara = Gnomes vs Trolls confirmed
---
Classic.
---
They took master loot out of retail too afaik
---
Did you ever do any mara farming as a hunter, and do you see any problems that we might have at launch will trying to farm mara?
---
Well day 1 if I can log in (server queues and other issues) I would hope to get level 10.
---
&gt; You will still get competition on quest, as one layer will have the population of a vanilla server.
---
Then layering caters to absolutely no one except Blizzard. It's not that I *want* all that competition, but I can easily tolerate it if it means the community won't be split up.
---
&gt; pex phase
---
That's a purely french term FYI.
---
I’m in the same position, I’m not free to play a game all day every day anymore, I think we’re just passed that period in our lives.  I’ll still play when I can but I know it won’t be as enjoyable as it once was with no stresses in life.
---
You are wrong, this is what some people are asking for. Maybe its 50/50, maybe more but as someone who played on release having spell batching and melee leeway is assinine on todays hardware. You use the terms fun and quirky, I use the term stupid and broken. Regardless of what you say/feel you can't convince me that it "adds a new layer of skill."
---
It's not actually mentioned in OP's post nor yours -- What is the second mount that Tauren can ride?
---
Once you get to C'thun, doesn't a shortcut open up that's right inside after Prophet?
---
&lt;3
---
&gt; I couldn't get ANY quests done in Coldridge Valley. None. I couldnt farm ANY mobs.
---
Why were you trying to? There's other things you can do in the game you know.
---
Still there btw
---
I always find it hilarious how there isn't a graveyard at the graveyard in duskwood.
---
Best thing I can say is that a lot of the time sink and difficulty in vanilla was due to the fact that everything was new and nobody knew how anything worked.
---
Leveling will still take awhile, but that is a big part of the fun and experience. Once you hit cap you will know exactly what you need to do and what gear to pursue, and player groups in general will be better so content will feel easier and quicker.
---
Modern WoW is good for the reasons you said, but I’ve always felt vanilla has a slower pace and has more clear stopping points than a system that has warforging and things of that nature. 
---
Just hop in, take your time and enjoy the ride.
---
Shush they will hear you.
---
I wasn’t aware of that one.. that’s a big oof.
---
I see, thanks pal
---
Yeah, that's fine for you to say that.
---
Personally? Not for me. I'd feel like a complete piece of shit human being myself if I decided that my subjective experience of a *videogame* took precedence over other players' safety. Especially when many players who get enticed by those third party gold offers are young, handicapped, or at risk.
---
There’s also the solution on Blizzard’s part, where they could open up a handful of new servers to migrate to, in the event where there’s still a 10k pop 2 weeks in. Perhaps it could be the RPPvP server so many people are waiting for. And then compound that with short queues to keep the game playable for those with children perhaps, but still actually representative of Vanilla.
---
I mean, gear is definitely abundant, but that dude is misrepresenting how PvP gear works. "Gladiator gear" is just the name of the gear. All PvP gear in Season 1 was called "Dread Gladiator's..." for whatever slot. The level of the gear you get is based on your rating, just like it should be. If you're a Rival, you get Rival gear that is lower iLvl. If you're gladiator, you get gladiator gear that is higher iLvl. The tag is what is relevant, just like the LFR, Normal, Heroic, Mythic tags for raid gear.
---
Guys guys, you're all wrong.

Have to no.  
---
Imagine dwarf as having 3-5 extra talent point, human as having 3-4 extra talent points, and NE and has having none extra.  It is a big difference, but not something that cannot be overcome.  
---
The gap betwen dwarf and human is somewhat overstated.  The gap between NE and dwarf/human is quite large.  
---
Arguably for pure pve holy human can be better because of the spirit difference.  For pvp, dwarf is clearly best, you will regret not having stoneform.
---
2,500 characters, loads of API functions... I believe the coding freedom is higher in vanilla servers with this AddOn. I just wanted something "equivalent" (IF statements, etc.). Not familiar with the Classic API though!
---
I agree that some godly boe items can be taken as pay to win. But most of the best gear is from
---
Raids and not bought. And even if you do buy it all. Doesn’t mean your gonna be a good player. 
---
It won’t get hacked by gold sellers they buy your stuff from ah. And no way have access to your account info. So basicly 0 chance of that happening. Millions are gonna buy gold and that’s just the way it is. Hopefully they just put tokens in so I can just spend a ton of cash and have gold without using third party.
---
I think Warstomp is the ultimate tiebreaker between the two factions. SOO many lifesaving situations with Warstomp.
---
I wish you would step back
---
From that ledge my friend
---
You could cut ties with all the lies
---
That you've been living in
---
And if you do not want to see me again
---
I would understand
---
For me it was every time I saw another player do something really cool on a class I hadn't made yet.
---
My fiance is dead set on rolling an orc warrior to dps and tank. I plan on duo leveling with her as either a tauren druid, orc shaman, or troll priest. But I cant make up my mind on what to roll. I find the most enjoyment while pvping, but I also want to be able to raid decently without really having to respec much. Do shamans or priests have a spec that is good in bgs/wpvp as well as raids?
---
My other option is to roll a rogue as I am a long time rogue player, but Ive always preferred dagger specs and I hate leveling with combat builds. Also I feel like rogue and warrior wont synergize that well while leveling and pvping as compared to a hybrid&amp;warrior.
---
No, it's not a random glitch, it's something that was added later into WoW, that bosses in cities don't attack NPCs.
---
In original Vanilla ofcourse, Bolvar would have killed Teremus, I kited him there many many times.
---
No changes isnt about not adding content (ok maybe for some people). Its about not doing stuff like changing stats on Naxx gear, or reworking classes. That sort of stuff.
---
The devs already said Classic+ is a possibility tho
---
What would one do after lvl 5 then? Just go back and do normal quests?
---
Honestly I wish they would do an open beta for two weeks with no layering at all. Just so I could see the epic shit storm of people complaining about bad sever quality and taking forever to get anything done in starter zones. Maybe that would get all the NoChAnGeS crowd to shut up for a while. 
---
This is a positive change and still so much shit about layering. I would kill to have layering on Live instead of sharding as it is now.
---
&gt;Fortunately for the majority of wow classic long term players, you are not running the wow classic team.
---
Very clever statement telling me, somebody who does not have any insider information, that I would not be fit to run a team that requires insider information to be run in the first place. No shit Sherlock? Fortunately you are not running that team either, because you have the same amount of information available as I do.
---
&gt;The proof would be from numbers they have internally for hours played, number of characters, and the realm.
---
You realise that you are talking about numbers that don't exist yet? All they can do is estimate and my guess is that they estimate wrong. But sure you know better?
---
&gt;That is in line when looking at the trend of active Warcraft server population from '04 to '19.
---
Yeah maybe but I don't think the WoW server population from the last expansions has much relevance towards Classic. But tell me more about why and how the BfA server population will be a precise prediction of the Classic WoW server population. I am listening curiously.
---
&gt; why not add 2 specifically for german and french for example?
---
Probably since it still promotes a sense of exclusion.  A player may think, "Oh, I am ZYX language, and I am not good enough to have my own language server?"  Or maybe they wanted to roll on the PVP server, but they only have a PVE server for them that has an active guild with raid times that suit his or her schedule.  It would be awesome if all servers had a guild that was suitable, which I think may be better served without language labels.  
---
&gt;What if you're raid leading on discord? You'll have a guild speaking your own language, else it's impossible to lead everyone if they don't speak the language right?

I had a Russian warlock in our horde first guild from lucifron up to Nefarian.  Couldn't speak a lick of English, but would join the ventrillo (discord) chat to see what to do.  It was always a good time to see when he had the Geddon bomb and would spam his /y macro to tell everyone that he, "AM BOMB."  The point is that it is possible, and it has occurred on servers and games in the past.  How does Microsoft, Sony, Mobile games, or Valve get by with online games filling with players organically without selecting which language they want to talk with?
---
Male orc hunters/shamans and anything male Undead (besides Warrior) were the biggest douchebags from my experience
---
Thats perfect, i can use that half tank half heal druid spec. Motw or what its name is
---
Female animations are so smooth for the alliance races. The spinning hair on female dwarfs when casting, death flip of female elfs ..
---
If I ever play human or dwarf male I'd have to unbind jump, it looks so ridiculous
---
that guy = awful melee dps
---
but you can craft a lionheart helm...lol
---
As far as vanilla is concerned, there was only one tank spec anyway.
---
Dark Dungeon makes me rage so hard.
---
It is a good game though.
---
Most streamers are going Alliance, if that's a big deal for you. The population will probably lean a bit torwards Alliance even on non-streamer servers.
---
Hey there. Based on your post I think we might be a good fit for each other. I could give you the typical info dump or we can just chat. You can reach me at wildgunmen#1302 on bnet or wildgunmen#9537 on discord. 
---
Whatever you, good luck in Classic!
---
Whats the point in having a lot of servers which are going to be dead after 2 months? You guys asking for character transfer then ? :LUL:
---
yeah I was responding to the comment before mine, that was comparing the drop rates to those of private servers. six slots and grey/white armor aren't really considered valuable, but they seemed a lot more common in the stress test than the servers I have tried.
---
I just hope to get on and make progress 
---
I dont expect a lot out of the servers 
---
If I hit ten I would be overjoyed
---
bLiZzArD wIlL nEvEr FiX lAyErInG
---
And its not like there is somewhere in that zone where a great deal of people like say an entire capital of the alliance died or anything
---
That’s why they have a robust beta?
---
Or, release another set of classic servers
---
your guild will fail miserably due to poor leadership
---
you are more interested in personally playing a meme spec than having a successful raid
---
GOD DAMMIT this is so true.
---
Finding it hard to be interested in anything, and it's my job to be interested in games.
---
Most mobs have around 5% dodge. One point in Imp Overpower is equal to 25% damage increase when it procs. 25% damage increase to 5% of your swings is 1,25% dps increase. Add in whatever things you can stack to make it better and yes, it'll be around 2% at most.
---
I hope so too. I raided BWL on a private server, and while it can’t be reliably compared to retail BWL our first few times on Nef could last for hours. It was extremely taxing but man that kill was so worth it.
---
I never said they are in the same bracket. I'm saying, that from looking at his vod, there was very little competition he had at all for Durotar.
---
You implied that because there is layering in Classic that there will be less population and less competition. I'm saying that from looking at the vod he had almost no competition and even with layering he is sure to run into way more people this time around.
---
this is still not adressing the issue. the cd cant be to long. if its longer then 5 min then you end up standing arround and waiting so you can do a quest with a friend who happens to be on a different layer. if the cd is shorter then 5 min then you can still abuse the system. ppl like me will abuse the shit out of it. i will be one of the first on lvl 60 on my server. this cd will not stop me from farming 100 arcanite crystals in a day  nor will it stop my guild mates from farming 200 devilsaur leather within a day. the ammount of currency that will be generated within the first few weeks of the server will be retarded. stuff like devilsaur leather or arcantie crystals are only worth something durring the early states and that will be the time layering will allow you to abuse the system
---
Escape from Tarkov, OSRS, and Mordhau
---
&gt; B. Blizzard only separates Russia because of their alphabet
---
&gt; Answer: Considering greek people have a different alphabet as well, it doesn't even make much sense to put the two communities in different situations.
---
the competent enhance player will do less damage than the tank and shadow priest...
---
why not make him a healer so he can help the raid? you arent making any sense
---
Pffff let's get Meta in this thread and argue which between Rogue, Warrior, or Mage is the most OP class to roll in classic. *Street Fighter Music* FIGHT!
---
It actually has been a decade since layering was put into WoW though.  Do not tell me that you did not see the damage it started doing to the community aspect of this game during the release of the Cataclysm.
---
An in-game anarchocommunist community. You have my sword.
---
Get into the starting area. Anything past that is a bonus.
---
Check one of the other 100 posts about this
---
Yea I get it. I was trying to say that i remember 6 slotters dropping like candy in vanilla.
---
no it was for the last stress test wich was public
---
[Here comes the pain bitch](https://youtu.be/oju6cjG3vJM)
---
Lol recommend retail over classic for rated. There is no rated in classic so obv retail is your only choice if you want that. Captain obvious
---
If we did it with no tears or sit macros in 2005, you can too
---
Exojump is great. The only problem is late game they give your position away.
---
I'm wondering if you could make a macro with Razer/Logitech software so it times the long jump perfectly every time. Would that be bannable?
---
Idk if you are delusional or you have been talking to someone else, because I have no idea where you get this from. 
---
I'm not on either side but here's some cons to multserver:
---
* It's not very dynamic, if blizzard wanted lower or higher caps it would be challenging to change, where as layering you can just change how many there is in each layer
---
* Some splits could be heavily overpopulated maybe due to a streamer or something, where as normal layering you can't force which layer you get as easily.
---
* Merges are never ideal, and could potentially cause issues/downtime
---
* With a steadily declining pop you could see some splits being really low pop before a merge is required/done.
---
Well, shit... if its not a glitch, they need to fix this.
---
Lvl 20-25! Then have a 6 hour sleep and get back at it haha.

In pvp holy paladin is more defensive pure healer/buffer with limited offensive options.  They pair extremely well with hunter since the hunter and the pet both get benefit from blessings, so while they don't add much damage themselves they add a lot by buffing the hunter's output.    
---
Holy priest is a target and especially vulnerable when purged, but dwarf is especially good on pvp priest.  Desperate prayer, and stoneform are excellent defensive abilities that mitigate your lower armor.  They generally play more offensively while still being a healer.  Often disc is more important tree in pvp then pure holy, since a lot of your globals will be non healing abilities.
---
Is Warrior... complicated enough to play? I used to play a Hunter in Vanilla, and my brother called that class first, so its either a Tauren Warrior or Shaman. I've had more experience with tank/dps classes in my MMO past, and wasn't sure I wanted to be someone (or if I would be any good at it) who gets constantly asked to heal in group situations, which is what I assume I'll be asked to do as a Shaman. I just don't want to get bored with a Warrior if the playstyle is less complicated.
---
Agreed.
---
 I had this issue in another MMO when we about a month in realized that we had rolled on the unofficial french server. It wasn't unplayable - but it was, like you said, two separate communities that didn't interact at all with each other.
---
Go ahead and sub.
---
Haha I was gonna say the same thing. He actually has a twitch and is gonna play another paladin in vanilla!
---
My aim for day 1 is to login. After that i can logout and go to sleep.
---
Legion was decent though.
---
Glad someone was inspired!  He is a lucky dude!
---
&gt; All you do is get post here and to r/unpopularopinion
---
I've never posted here. I posted once on /r/unpopularopinion yesterday, but that's it.
---
I do comment a lot here though, because I'm honestly tired of this subreddit blindly defending Blizzard. It's so pathetic to watch.
---
I guarantee if they announced LFG and LFR for classic, you'd be in my face defending that too. A year ago, I was apparently "trolling" and "fearmongering" for thinking that they might add sharding, and look where we are now! Suddenly all the fanboys are sperging about how amazing it is because Blizzard told them so.
---
&gt; You don't know what you want except that you won't be happy regardless of what happens.
---
Not true at all. If layering was what I thought it was when they announced it, I would've been extremely happy. But it wasn't, it's just sharding with a mask.
---
Because of the layering cooldown?
---
Cannot believe some of the top posts on this subreddit
---
I want to play a class that can pvp and do low-mid level pve with the same spec.
---
I've been thinking of 30/21 ele/resto shaman to pvp ele and heal raids and dungeons but skarms youtube channel has me thinking about tanking again (always tanked in retail)
---
Does anyone have experience with something like 31/3/17 warriors? Basically picking up mortal strike, then going into prot for improved shield block for the 5 sec crit immunity uptime and last stand?
---
How much pvp effectiveness is lost by not spending those 17 points on fury talents and how much tanking effectiveness is lost by not having shied slam and the extra mitigation talents?
---
100? you're underestimating
---
It is absolutely the best
---
Maybe 100 a day hehe
---
I'm contemplating between playing a priest or shaman. I plan to heal in PvE and ranged dps in PvP. I'm only gonna play for about 10-15 hours a week so fast leveling and gold farming is a must. I would like to to have enchanting/tailoring as my professions if I play a priest so I can make my own gear and bags, but I heard alchemy/herbalism (my go-to professions if I play a shaman) also has good gold-making potential. Which class can heal in 5-mans better as a non-healing spec while leveling/collecting healing gear prior to raids?
---
So you are saying dividing servers and labeling them by language will result in ghost towns?  Specifically saying the French and Germans servers will be fucked by low populations?  Since the minorities rolled on the higher population English realms.
---
I mean it will still be a lot better 1-40 if we're talking a pure pve dps standpoint.
---
If you're going to be pvping or tanking at all though, arms is the way to go. Anger management and tac mastery are too good for those.
---
Going Horde resto Shaman for Raiding and PvPing with guild mates (healing in Warsong/AB/AV groups and such). 
---
Does troll racials really make that much of a difference in PvE? 
---
I was leaning towards Tauren to give a little boost to stun/hp in pvp and lvling. Maybe orc for stun resist
---
The same problem with layering has been plaguing live with sharding since it was put in, so you can't really say it was a new problem they wouldn't have known about before beta started. It was literally the main complaint everyone had when layering was initially brought up. (and even before then when people were saying please for the love of god don't shard classic long before we had any details at all)
---
You seem like you just want to be mad.  None of your comment was really even an argument or point, just ranting.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
The way this is colored and laid out makes me not want to read it, sorry.
---
Had them all exalted in vanilla....maybe not this time lol.
---
Just searched the sub for posts with "beta access".
---
Not finding anything related to my question.
---
I tried man, googled for a while. Keep finding articles that say if you are able to install you are in.
---
Thanks for sharing the useful shortcut.
---
To clarify, for anyone who is thinking, "What does this tell me in terms of WoW and why do I care?": 
---
OP is addressing a common misconception that an item with a given drop rate, 1 out of *n* kills, is **guaranteed** to drop after *n* kills. In fact, the number of mobs killed has *no effect* on the probability of the desired item dropping on the next kill.
---
For example, if mob A has a 25% (1/4) chance to drop Item X, then *n* equals 4. After 4 kills, if you still haven't seen the drop, don't fool yourself into thinking that the game is cheating you. You only had a \~63% chance to get the drop **within** *n* kills. Every kill of mob A has the same 25% chance of dropping Item X, regardless of how many have been killed already.
---
You cannot reasonably expect a drop to occur soon until you have accrued upwards of 3*n*\-4*n* kills. Even then, each mob still has the same probability of dropping the desired item, meaning it is entirely possible (although unlikely) for an item with a 25% drop rate to never drop even after a hundred kills.
---
2 min is not nearly enough. devilsaurs are 10-15 min respawn. layerhopping will still be way better then to wait for the normal respawn time. same goes for ores. i run a 10-15 min rounds in burning stepps and take all the rich thorium, then i layerhop and do the same thing again. if i run out of layers b4 the first layer respawns then i just do a bigger circle for the next lap till i find th perfect circle. this internal cd doesnt change anything. you can still avoid ganks with layerhopping assuming you just died and someone is ganking you. you just wait 2 min in ghost form and then layerhop to avoid pvp
---
Someone typed in raid chat: “every rogue who is not Bloodvenom can go off themselves right now”, I was laughing so much.
---
Can't go wrong with troll priest. Should have no issues healing as shadow while leveling.  You'll have no gear overlap while leveling. You'll start in the same zone(and not have run on druid class quests to complete).
---
Someone else can probably say better, but i do not recall priest raiding requiring many talents, you'll be in high demand regardless.
---
You must've been in normie groups then

There are tons of undeveloped areas in the Classic world just begging to be finished. People put up their ideas for them all the time, and it's glorious to see.
---
Did you comment this on the wrong post or something? Otherwise I don’t see the point...
---
basically, you came here for some info... but the info is irrelevant. PlAy HoW yOu WaNt To PlAy!
---
Ok hunters get 36% and can also apply dots?
---
The more I think of this comment the more dumb it sounds.
---
How the hell is crafting an occasional item at an anvil more exciting than having tons of trinkets, bombs, pets, etc.? 
---
I got a weaponsmith with full thorium rep. There hasn't been a single exciting moment with the profession. Lol
---
You are not right in the head or something
---
How is this categorised exactly? I cant tell what premade or world, etc...
---
Setting a pickpocket macro bound to stealth openers is the name of the game! I will have this macro in place for humanoids and for beasts will be skinning as I go. Overall between these two options you will get your mount and continue questing as you go!

&gt;Me: raids for weeks
---
It is fair.  You have been "raiding for weeks".  Therefore you have been getting lots of loot.  He logged on and got ONE item over you.  Is this a big deal?  He raided, he got an item.  You raided more.  You got MORE items.  
---
Only a selfish person feels entitled to ALL the loot. Again, you put in more time raiding....you GOT more loot.
---
As regards to your first problem, this isn't theoretical.  We have a decade or more worth of data to go on.  DKP is the fairest system out there.  It's not perfect, no system is, but its leagues ahead of flat rolling or loot council.
---
Aug 27 is my birthday so im gonna take a shot everytime i level
---
You say that after having said the first sentence of your previous comment? :D 
---
Apart from being cocky I did actually say something relevant:
---
&gt;You realise that you are talking about numbers that don't exist yet? All they can do is estimate and my guess is that they estimate wrong.
---
And:
---
&gt;Yeah maybe but I don't think the WoW server population from the last expansions has much relevance towards Classic. 
---
Besides I actually mean this if you really have an interesting explanation:
---
&gt;But tell me more about why and how the BfA server population will be a precise prediction of the Classic WoW server population. I am listening curiously.
---
For sure man, it will be really nice to be in starter zones with bags and maybe one or two for the bank as well!
---
We are in the "IT'S JUST BETA! DON'T WORRY ABOUT NOT HAVING LEGENDARIES, NETHERLIGHT CRUSABLE, CLASS SETS WHEN BFA GOES LIVE!  THE AZERITE ARMOR TRAITS ARE JUST LEVELING GEAR AND NOT THE FINAL STAGE OF ITEMIZATION!" Stage of warcraft classic.  Sometimes worrying and speaking out can make changes.  Sometimes it takes a year to get from a broken beta product to a product like the azerite essences and mechagon trinkets and rings created to make some form of end game gearing exciting.  If you didn't or don't pay attention to BFA then just never mind.  It was a long road to get to 8.2 from 8.0 beta.
---
It's funny because Classic Wow exists solely because of the community and despite Blizzard.
---
Log in as soon as possible. Enjoy the ever living shit out of anything I'm able to do.
---
Log out and work for a few hours. Log back in until my eyes are failing me. Rinse and repeat.
---
TL;DR but: Do a flip!
---
Yeah I definitely read the tweet as it's just a CD that's basically always active if you're doing something in the world, but it would make a lot more sense to more or less always let you layer swap once to play with a friend at any time, then as soon as you did something on a layer it just says "you were on a different layer in the last 15 minutes or whatever and are now doing something on this layer, so here's a cooldown on swapping again" etc
---
I used to have a level 30 twink warrior on horde and we would fight against a male dwarf warrior/female dwarf priest twink named Shasta. She was the only female dwarf I remember from my vanilla days
---
assuming your only doing tailoring.
---
You need just short of 80 linen (plan on 80 in case you need extra to get essesne instead of dust), Make those into bolts.
---
Turn those bolts into Brown linen Robes (cheapest green tailor can make)
---
Disenchant those robes (raises enchanting high enough to make first wand)
---
Add simple wood to the components you got from disenchanting and make the level 5 wand.
---
You'll need another 200 or so linen to make enough robes to disenchant, to raise your enchanting skill high enough to make the level 11 wand.   (do all the disenchanting first for the free skill gains up to 70ish),
---
Only burn materials if your desperate.
---
Just give me the option of rolling on a server without layering, it's all i ask at this point.
---
If they would have dished out the weapon first I would totally agree, however you can't have this rule then roll on the helmet first lol.
---
I want the updated graphics. These NOCHANGES neckbeards can keep their busted ass looking visuals, I just want the challange of vanilla leveling play, AND the pretty models.
---
Ugh. This guy.
---
WHYYYY is there not black hair for normal night elves.
---
Just because you're bad at jumping doesn't mean it's cheating. And if it is cheating, who cares about it when everyone can cheat?
---
It adds an additional element of skill. Git gud or stop whining.
---
Either. But most interested in PvP
---
I feel like so much of that relies on world buffs.
---
18% extra spell crit from Dragonslayer, songflower and DM buff. Plus however much you get from 15% extra int from SoZ.

When my fishing is over 100
---
Yeah dude my GF still dosent know im a huge nerd cause I only play it when shes not around. Would be cool to meet a girl that is into WoW though for sure.
---
Yea just that. Shoulda been more specific
---
To be fair, I could go for some puppers and a dance at the ag hall.  
---
I want bralwer's guild in wow classic!
---
Undead. The pet bonus damage of Orc is minute for Warlock
---
It will be active for months, they already said as much (Ion saying they hope it will be gone by Phase 2).
---
You're literally advocating for adding too many servers at launch and then merging them.
---
Split servers are just separate servers! Until you merge them!
---
There's no shared community between them.
---
Ha, the looking away part got me. Not Classic but I remember healing on my pally and having to zoom in looking directly at the floor healing through some fights  or else the computer would lock up. Good times!
---
It's not an advantage, everyone can do it.
---
People ganking me negatively impacts my game experience, should that be bannable?
---
Haha all good - ah well that’s the nature of the news cycle!
---
If only the game was more like DAoC with a 3rd faction choice and a unique class for each faction. I was really disappointed when they made Shamans available for Alliance and Paladins available for Horde back in BC.
---
It's an unintended use of game geometry to gain an advantage over other players. It's directly against Blizzard's TOS. I get that you enjoy doing it and it's coloring your reasoning, but you're objectively wrong about this.
---
You're asking me why I don't want to quest and why I don't want to kill mobs at level 2?
---
Think about that and then comment later if that's your honest question.
---
Complain about?? We only want the best version of classic you doorknob. Go go back to retail.
---
Good luck trying to spellpushback a holypala ;)
---
correct case /closed
---
No since there are enough french (9% on playerbase) and german (20%) to sustain a server? Minorities being too little won't want to get on a serv that speaks german and made it unofficially theirs, don't you think? So they'll go to an english speaking one. But big communities will have their unofficial ones. And if minorities get there, they'll have to cope with FR or DE
---
Thank you for the correction. Obviously been a while since Retail Vanilla so it was a recent experience pserver that was fresh on my mind.
---
I want to be level 30 before I log off on day 1.
---
I'm also confused as to why you had both the bloodsail buccaneers and the syndicate as 'hostile' factions. You can grind both to exalted and friendly (or honored I can't remember) respectively. Other factions, such as Brood of Nozdormu and Timbermaw Hold, that you put in neutral section start as hostile or hated as well so they should be in the hostile section or there should be no hostile section.
---
Certainly depends on the demand.  But a lot of okayers think BC was the Pinnacle of WoW.
---
I don't.  But it's definitely a good argument to be made.
---
Hunter vs Warlock?
---
I care about being able to solo things and gold farm, and also about how fun they are to play in AV (and other battlegrounds to an extent). I don't care about wpvp. 
---
I will raid, but I understand that hunter won't be the best later on; though I assume it will be geared much faster than a lock competing against mages and more locks for gear.
---
If you care about PvP, go horde.
---
lvl 5 probably
---
Ah I didn't get that! Thought it was about the cyrillic alphabet, not the grammar rules. My bad
---
You know what scams a lot more young and vulnerable people than gold sellers?  
---
Pay-to-win games.
---
666 days to be exact.
---
Shift click - problem solved
---
Ganking is an intended part of the game. Wall jumping to glitch outside of the intended boundaries of a battleground is not. You're making a deliberately specious argument.
---
Why would it be dead if it's just one more server? You think ONE specific german serv will be dead after two months? Then the game itself is fucked if there's so few people predicted.
---
In darkshore you will get a quest for Planestrider Stew where you can farm that as well. I forget what level you need to be to actual learn the recipe though. Maybe 40-50?
---
For real though, those discs are sexy af.
---
&gt; The only problem is late game they give your position away.
---
Im not positive but I think if you do a single scroll with mwheeldown it doesn't make any noise
---
Varian was a Stern king do
---
You can also wait until the ahn'qiraj war and turn in materials for the war effort. These will give you commendations that you can hand in for a specific cities reputation.
---
Yeah, mine too. horde griefers perma-camping outside there so force a 10+ minute corpse run. So pathetic...
---
At work and cannot view this currently....but can someone TL;DR the differences between this BiS/google doc....and the 2-3 others that have been referenced a dozen times in the past week?
---
Serious question. I'm just wondering at what point is this going to get super redundant, or is each new list covering some major blind spot the others seemingly missed.
---
Did you use the correct pally bubble macro? Or are you going to get it kicked
---
They kept having the free server transfers well into having the paid option as well.  I don't really remember when they stopped, but they were definitely a thing while I was paying for xfers because a couple times friends chose to re-roll on a realm specifically because the transfer was free.
---
And 700+ comments, can basically read the thread for dayyyyyys xD
---
Warrior is too complicated if anything.  I’m trying out warrior and tanking on pservers and my hands hurt.  You are always in a frenzy to keep aggro and pick up loose mobs and people hate waiting for even one sunder.  
---
I rerolled shaman and the game is 3x as fun.
---
No. Read my comment again.
---
Cheetah ain't doing squat while you're dazed buddy, and switching forms removes concussive. Plus druids can also hot and stealth from cat form. A good druid will get away from a good hunter 9 out of 10 times.
---
Okay?  Nothing stopping Blizzard from rolling out a fresh start server every once in a while, or stopping people from rerolling.  I'd have loved to have extra time back during Vanilla to get BiS gear on my main and work on alts.
---
I believe there is an option to hide bars. Can't remember if this was achieved through an addon or if it was in the base UI options but I recall having several bars of keybinds **that did not have cooldowns to moniter** that I keybound then hid.
---
Have you considered druid? 
---
Has similar role diversity while having a stealth option too. Could be handy and lead to fun shenanigans.
---
Paladin isn't a bad pairing. Not sure how much you are looking to milk the comp though.
---
Yeah but I need to get on the floating rocks in Nagrand and I won't let you take that from me.
---
Advocating ? That's a bit much, I'm informing of the various options and their pros &amp; cons for this situation.
---
Yes there's no shared community between the servers before the merge.

Would this be a temporary fix. To their temporary fix?
---
This right here is all you need. I’ve been going through a ton of his videos. Does a fantastic job of setting the story and world up. The only downside is that most of the content is separated by character, rather than purely chronological. But he does a good job of telling the stories of all the major players and where things stand.
---
yeah thats a way they could go
---
I say priest since your defensive dispel is the only way warriors get out of things like frost nova and entangling roots horde side (no paladin for blessing of freedom).
---
Extend Alliance 1 block next to Silverwing Sentinels and put it there (and swap Silverwing Sentinels with Wintersaber Trainers, so that the 3 PvP Factions are together),  then you can center Syndicate and Bloodsail Buccaneers at the remaining 3 blocks, you should also move up the Defiles then.
---
To be fair, they didn't include everything in vanilla WoW either. You have to push the damn game out of the door sometime... it's just that more and more the games are being pushed out in a clearly unfinished state.
---
the fuck? All female nelfs are warriors in lore.
---
In other games, people simply cope with and speak english FOR THE MOST PART. Except in games like League of Legends, spanish people keep speaking spanish if they can't speak english, and then you can't communicate with them at all. Turkish people speak turkish, the english mock the french going "baguette". On a community-based game, this will be a pain in the ass.
---
I see what you mean with exclusion, except this will be justified by the % of players. But as of right now, the 9% of french and 20% of german are ignored. Spanish being 2% of the players makes more sense to not have a server, but they'll still try to group up and have a clan on one server. But if the server is unofficially german, then good luck having interaction....
---
At launch, UBRS was difficult enough that it required a 15-man group to beat.  I think it was scaled back some in later patches, though... making it only a 10-man by the time Vanilla ended.
---
Imagine if people would just type out Deadmines and Dire Maul. We might achieve world peace.
---
That's gonna be a yikes from me dawg.
---
What I'd like to see as a mitigating factor for the server squish issue would just be setting up battle group type things with servers where for population reasons at launch they are different servers, however they share the same name restrictions etc so when populations start to dwindle they can more easily merge the server without running into collisions with names/guild names.  I'm sure there are other challenges that I'm just not thinking of, but I know that was a big one as far as why server merges were so shit.  This time they'd have the forethought to avoid at least that part of it. (and would need to tell the player base before hand what servers will merge later etc ofc)
---
I feel like having more of the logic exposed to players in any way is a direct disadvantage to the majority of players.  If any elitist or person that visits classicwow subreddit for the newest exploit can "game the system" in some way that is not well know, it is not good.  
---
An elegant loading screen tip, "When you invite a guild mate or player in a different layer of azeroth, you may not be able to group with a third group on a third layer for a long period of time."  
---
"Try inviting other players to join together for elite quests.  If you cannot see the leader of the party, ask them to leave the party and invite them to your group."
---
That is because of the sharding and phasing technology used in retail that wont be here come classic.
---
Hoping to log in, get UI, keybinds, all that jazz set up, and get to level 10 so I can meet my buddy in the Barrens. That is probably wishful thinking for the first few hours, so just logging in and getting everything set up would be awesome.
---
Yes and no.  The system requires that there is a value placed on these so that you can draw them out.  In a way - there is a capitalist element to it.
---
Though - in other games like Ark, Conan Exiles, Atlas, and other games - I have been very much trying to promote the good of the guild/tribe/etc is good for all.  Though - those games actually punish decentralization and you are much safer if everyone is working towards the goal of say... having a defensible base.
---
Personally, I'd like to see a "pure" set of servers, and a OSRS style "progression" set of servers where they can pump out new content to their hearts content, and people who aren't interested in that don't have to deal with it.
---
I was watching this stream.  I went to bed when the dumbass hunter pulled the boss to wipe everyone and then left, so I'm glad to see they managed to pull it off.
---
Can you define to me exactly how Blizzard commits identity theft and credit-card fraud?
---
Or are you just talking out of your ass making comparisons because you can't just accept your stance on this?
---
Didn't ever imply if it was acceptable or not.
---
I just said if my kid is an adult, they have the right to do what they want.
---
Stop putting words in my mouth.
---
People were so angry that people could exploit layering to farm nodes and escape PvP so Blizzard fixed it with a cooldown before being able to change layers after doing those sorts of activities. Everyone was happy about this change because it meant they could now have layering for three weeks as planned without... no, it was a shitshow, obviously.
---
Hi, /u/CodyMueller

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5uad5/how_long_does_it_take_to_level_to_60_need_data/). 
---
Not trying to be a downer, but be prepared for the scenario where you never actually get to log in and spend your entire birthday sober and frustrated.
---
My main goal is to not die from a blood clot. Honestly though, I'll be happy if I'm able to hit lvl 30 before logging off. Then I'll sleep for 4-6 hours and repeat the process of hopefully hitting 40 by the end of day 2.
---
There will be one, since supermacro itself focuses on expanding macro length and lets you write custom LUA functions.  
---
If you’re wanting to write complex targeting and spell casting conditionals like you can on private servers, you’re going to be out of luck because all those functions are all protected in the current client.  
---
It’s a very non-Vanilla situation, but no one is particularly interested in duking it out about protected functions when they larger issues like layering and meleeway are taking the forefront of conversation.
---
Can a brotha get some sauce on that wintersaber trainers pic?
---
Totally truth, its verz boring just tank and spank mobs till 36...
---
Okay, maybe not advocating, but how is the split server any different from just having more servers and no solution to the problems that layering solves?
---
I'm not trying to imply she's blameless in this, far from it. Apologies if it came across that way. She knowingly pursued a relationship with someone new without ending the relationship she was already in. Nobody's in the right in this story.
---
As the first comment in the link says,
---
Seems like some additions that would entail the layering being longer than a few weeks.
---
Very interesting! I was kinda hoping I'd have something to do beyond Auto Attack as a Warrior. Do you find yourself healing more or doing hybrid DPS as a Shaman?
---
Valerine - The Forsaken fire mage
---
Absolutely agree that they left a ton of open ended options in Vanilla that never got fully fleshed out, and would be cool to see under the lense of Classic, but I wouldn't want to see a BC or Wrath rerelease changed significantly from what it actually was, much the way we want Classic to be true to Vanillas core, but not a carbon copy.
---
Stupidest thing ever.  Kill mobs by pressing buttons like any other class.
---
Dont know how it will be in classic but in retail there is an addon called clique where you cam bind spells from your spellbook
---
Nobody upvotes the middle ground. That’s why clickbait works. Are you going to care enough to vote something to that top that’s mundane and reasonable? Or are you going to vote something up that’s EXTREME?   
---
It’s human nature.   
---
We are attracted to the outliers. The outliers who are yelling the loudest for change are the most likely to get it. So why not complain and pretend it’s the end of the world?  What’s blizzard most likely to respond to:   
---
“guys, I think layering isn’t so great.  People may not like it and there are negative consequences to it being in the game. You should maybe fix it before release.”  
---
“I’M DONE. Taking my money elsewhere. Game is dead and it’s all because of layering.”
---
The guards in the bfa part killed me 🤣
---
IMO leveling gets much harder after 30.
---
Zones become sparser and quests dont give enough so its grindier.
---
Thats how i justify it to myself lmao
---
Languages:
---
PVE vs PVP preference:
---
* English
---
 * PVE 60.57%
---
 * PVP 20.78%
---
 * RP 13.72%
---
 * RP-PVP 4.93%
---
* German
---
 * PVE 53.65%
---
 * PVP 39.13%
---
 * RP 3.75%
---
 * RP-PVP 3.47%
---
* French
---
 * PVE 55.95%
---
 * PVP 32.39%
---
 * RP 9.77%
---
 * RP-PVP 1.89%
---
* Italian
---
 * PVE 83.57%
---
 * PVP 16.43%
---
* Spain
---
 * PVE 38.60%
---
 * PVP 55.85%
---
 * RP 4.12%
---
 * RP-PVP 1.42%
---
* Portuguese
---
 * PVE 100% 
---
With no RP-PVP servers being available, let's assume half of RP-PVP players will go to PVP realms and half will go to an RP realm.
---
EU gets:
---
* 2 PVP realms (A &amp; B)
---
* 2 PVE realms (C &amp; D)
---
* 1 RP realm (E)
---
Through coordinated efforts, all the minority languages band together to all choose the same PVE and PVP realms (Germany chooses A &amp; C, France and all the rest choose B &amp; D), the English evenly spread through all of them. This is what you end up with:
---
A-PVP is 52.84% German and 47.16% English
---
B-PVP is 61.36% English and 38.64% Something Else
---
C-PVE is 36.08% German and 63.92% English
---
D-PVE is 70.02% English and 29.98% Something Else
---
E-RP is 82.71% English and 17.29% Something Else
---
So realistically, the English speakers only need to care about announcing 1 of the 2 PVP realms as their own and they'll have a large majority on everything else.
---
Oh boy, you know I don't know cause my guild only could get to Twin Emps.  I just remember having to run forever mounted on that bug.  I think it was made worse by the sting of a wipe :(
---
&gt; as having it limited to &lt;20 lvl zones, it still works
---
ERROR 37! You have currently tried to enter hillsbrad foothills.  The realm currently only allows 5,500 players to enter level 20 and higher zones.  You will have to turn around to Silverpine Forest or wait in a queue of 6,784 players until you can continue playing your level 19 mage.
---
Someone timed it and using this from the spawn of your new character takes like 15 min to get XR, CT, and TB flight path and you get a level from exploration alone. I’ve never bothered but seems worth it to me
---
Well, you know any sensible argument is over when they start using "objectively wrong".
---
Blizzard's ToS is worded very vaguely. Why do you think that is? They don't blatantly want to condone it, but they don't want to ban people for it either.
---
That name sounds [somewhat familiar](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/416216542225891331/580870109736861716/unknown.png) (classic beta).  
---
Imposters everywhere D:
---
If this OC you are indeed very creative, thank you for your post, it made me chuckle
---
The fuck? https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sisterhood_of_Elune
---
Confirming that “leeway” is totally broken on the beta.  Hope this can be fixed or it’s gonna be a tough life for casters.
---
It's different because classic is expected to have a massive dropoff of playerbase due to a lot of tourists playing at launch. Layering and the multiserver comes from dealing with having those massive amounts of players but still maintaining healthy populated servers after the tourists leave.
---
I put them in the red section if they both start hostile and offer no real rewards for the rep
---
How many of you psychos plan on getting exalted with the Bloodsail Buccaneers? Cause I sure as hell am.
---
I think this video better illustrates why it needs to be removed.
---

---
The reaction and look on his face as npcs kill him from a range they have no business doing would be comical if I wasn't horrified about experiencing the same.
---
In BGs youll have paladins, which are honestly more of an issue (more dispell classes on your side, wotf is a 2min cd).
---
No, it's not. Just because when an issue gets brought up and gets a lot of attention, there are people freaking out about it acting like children, doesnt mean its the people freaking out are the reason it gets changed.  
---
If 10,000 people give feedback on something and make it a popular issue, it's not required for half of them to lose their minds about it.
---
The 6-8% was just about what I was getting on my napkin math (10% gain of glancing damage, base 70%, and assumption that white damage is 50% of my damage, so (10/70)*.5 to get ~7.1%
---
But like you said, rage values gained, how +hit actually worked relative to vanilla is a bit lost. 
---
&gt; For a tank
---
I guess I never really though about this.  I'm debating if I just want to try and go full tank or at least be one of the two off tanks.  But is that 9-12% threat difference something to worry about as alliance with blessing of salvation?
---
But what about all the people who have special characters in their names? People might want to report somebody for doing or saying something shitty, but not want to open up character map just so they can type the person's name. Right click report gets rid of that problem
---
You're not taking misses and parries into account. Which is another base 10% of your hits. 
---
But regardless, what would you pick instead?
---
Where did you go to get this done? The glass and the frame are really nice, im hoping my local Michaels can have this made for my wife and I. We met on WoW 7 years ago :)
---
And Warla is exalted with all of them.
---
Yes, it will cause some trouble amongst minority groups that will still buy the game and Blizzard will completely ignore because all they care about is the macro economics of a launch title.
---
Personally I'd like to see after some period of time (say 6-12 months after the final content phase of Classic), for them to release a set of "progression servers" that would be an OSRS style new content but still level 60/vanilla classes and talents, and then leave other servers as "pure" Classic servers for people who aren't interested in new Classic content.
---
Let people migrate from pure servers to progression servers if they want, but not the other way around.
---
OK Osrs, we are having a poll today about how polls are going to be ran.  But first, we need to have a poll on the running of the poll poll.  To vote on the poll of the poll poll please login to your poll poll poll account and vote before the end date.

---
I'll ask you once again: How are multi-servers any different from not having layering and being forced to open too many servers at launch?
---
There's no permeability between subservers the way there is with layering so what I'm trying to say is that subservers are not a solution that requires an extra category. Subservers is just *not layering.* You don't need a name for it. It's what would inevitably happen if you don't have layering.
---
Why does it need an extra name?
---
Then the final change gets solidified through an integrity change because the players usually vote like retards anyways.
---
pft, post vanilla art looks like shit
---
Wat? You are trolling
---
There's 6 action bars total in Vanilla. The 5 normal plus the one secondary page of your main action bar. You could hide an entire row of binded spells at a time, but you can't bind things out of your spellbook to save space.
---
You weren't stuck with a meat only pet lol.  That was your choice.
---
Yes pets had lots of issues.  I still was in the best wsg groups pushing guildmates to  HW and I used my pet in pvp constantly.  Cat or boar for me.  Meat isn't even that hard farm a high value beast camp or fish...
---
I very rarely was combat locked and I think people were just too slow prepping their pet pre feign but i can't say.  It wasn't an issue for me.  Boar snare into feign flag drop freeze trap flag pick was something i did a million times with only a few failures...  Maybe it was less common with boar since lower AS.  Idk never stopped me from getting the most out of Porky.
---
I can't speak to the WSG pet rez.  I honestly don't know when that started.  I remember it in wsg but always or which xpac idk.
---
You can tell the streamers pretty easily
---
Tries to 1v1 a shadow priest = not streaming
---
Blows CD’s to run away from 1v1 with a shadow priest = streaming
---
I don’t know about other classes, but priests are totally fine healing dungeons while specced for leveling.
---
That would be my bigest fear too. Happened to me in a different game. Basically had the choice between 3 guilds at the end. Wasn't very fun, especially if you don't like any of the GM's etc.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Thats adorable, Now you're off to WoW classic to duo level a warrior and a healer right?!
---
According to classicast, this is not really leeway but a Cataclysm era range increase for melee.  Gonna be really broken if not fixed.  Also AoE leeway, which was a real thing, is broken.
---
The solution to that would be to create a unique name for every realm and obfuscate the population at the beginning, that way the population would be evenly-ish distributed.
---
Wait you are complaining when you guys did not even kill C'thun........Hell TGP, IE and P4L were better than you guys. You lost all ability to complain. 
---
As for my dates We formed in as the world new DV at the end of September(i thought it was beginning of Oct but that was when I came over and my first screen shot was). It happened because Royal Council could not get passed Rag, they had too many dead weight players. From there we cleared BWL in late November, looks like we passed you by then, prior to cascading. Then in December to early Jan we cascaded for about a month until it was corrected. They tied the instance lock out to zone in then. But hey looking at your guys progression, you fell off hard after a strong start........
---
Ohh look 5 days later and blizzard fixed layering you whacko 
---
Now you got two options 
---
Stfu or keep on being idiotic
---
It would probably be quicker.
---
What should I pay?  
---
Feral Druid Tank
---
Elemental Shaman
---
Raiding through Naxx
---
Without a doubt.
---
Most people stack spirit gear pre 30 because it does add up a lot. After 30 the benefits aren't that noticeable, but it still helps.

Lol at all the people calling me an idiot for telling them over and over again layering was not working as intended. Big part of this sub is to stupid to shit.
---
Past two?  Legion was actually good, WoD was trash, but okay.
---
Sad that you can't trust her to like you for you pal
---
If you are guarding the flag, like a shadow priest likely would in a pre-made, sometime that DP is the difference between killing the EFC and letting him get away. It adds some much-needed burst that priests lack.
---
Don't play on a high pop server then. That's basically always been the solution. (this isn't a fuck you stop complaining post just literally that is the solution for you if this were the case) Check what servers streamers are planning to launch on in addition to guilds like method (I just assume they're going to be doing something) who are huge enough to garner a bunch of fans following them, and just avoid those servers.   I'm already going to be doing that purely due to not wanting streamer effect bullshit ruining the game constantly.  Toxicity is going to follow around the big streamers like crazy, so a smaller server sounds great this time around.
---
Back in the day the large servers had massive queue times, and I never had a queue as far as I can remember outside of big patch days etc, and even then was a tiny one. That was on a medium pop server as well. The only 4-5 hour queues would be on the incredibly populated servers.
---
I'd say it's more comprehensive in the gear it lists (not just giving a 1st and 2nd option), contains filters for content phases and gives you precise item value based on your current stats / details on what stat is most valuable to you.
---
But I would say that.
---
I probably do the start area then park my char in the first inn.
---
You mean without the BC balance changes? Exactly what's wrong with the BC balance changes? BC expansion minus the content is just talking about level cap change and balance, and most agree TBC was better balanced than vanilla.
---
I've got a 30 hour stream planned. Goal is level 30.
---
I was there lol I can also see my guild mate in your picture ( he is in the far right and is a nelf) has fun
---
Ohh look how layering got not fixed at all
---
fucking lol mate
---
I just checked out your site and its pretty neat! Is there a way to print out the route/maps 1-60? I loaded up horde undead and I like the formatting style just would prefer if I could have it next to me as I do not have access to a second screen.
---
Thats what BC pills and vasectemies are for. Who in a serious relationship doesn't, any way?
---
Why 48+? Guess that's the HK cutoff?
---
Def not ele shammy
---
Servery McServerface
---
I'll believe that when I see a blue post
---
Yep, iirc - that's the lowest level a 60 will get honour for.
---
Obviously not.
---
On retail, you fly CAN through FP's you haven't learned yet.
---
In Classic, 
---
On retail, you fly CAN NOT  through FP's you haven't learned yet.
---
if you don't know a FP that links two FP,   then you can't Fly between them.. e.g. A -&gt; B -&gt; C if you know A and C, but don't know B you won't be able to Fly to B or C from A, and you won't be able to Fly to A or B from C. For instance, without Ratchet, you can't fly to Gagetzan from Astranar.
---
We live together. She wouldn’t know the difference if I said I was playing WoW or league of legends or runescape etc etc. Bae is just playing computer games in her eyes.
---
So you're complaining about people pointing out errors on a beta? Remind what a beta is for again? Is it pointing out errors and bugs? 
---
The cooldown may be insufficient to prevent exploits. People need to do more testing to check if it still can be exploited. People shouldn't shut up about layering if it can still be exploited. All we have at the moment is a rumour from someone who's been notoriously misinformed in the past. Until people present concrete evidence that the system can no longer be exploited we should still assume it can be exploited, given that the current evidence we do have suggests that.
---
Whose the tank and whose the healer?
---
Somebody is upset lol.
---
Nah we will clear all the content it'll be easy peasy. If you think Vanilla raids are that difficult maybe BfA is more your speed.
---
I'll be leveling my hunter first to absolutely farm as much gold as possible. Then take my warrior to 60 with plenty of consumes and gear.
---
I hope for their sake that pserver stays low and out of the spot light. The big mouse has death beam laser eyes when it thinks even a cent of money is at stake.
---
Lol it's cute how upset you all get
---
You need to stop deluding yourself lmao
---
Right. Get my ass kicked by a Warrior in PVP? Guess I gotta roll Warrior now so I can also kick someone's ass.
---
/r/classicwow
---
I think the average player who goes out of their way to play on a pserver is quite a bit better than the average player in classic and this will have a big impact on pug raids.
---
Use an add-on like Bartender so you can drag your bars. Then drag one of the bars off-screen, so you can't see it.
---
Warrior and druid are probably the two most complicated classes
---
Yeah lots in that group but there was always a group (and still is) who say  people whop want it will not like it and roce-colored glasses etc etc  Those guys can kiss the hairiest part on me arse
---
The hope would be first VC run cleared with all the quests done. If servers don’t crash I should be able to achieve this.
---
the other mark against tauren is the huge hitbox when in caster form, gonna get hit more by melee enemies in pvp
---
I like this mentality. When I lumbered through the first time, my friends dragged my main to 70, and then I "played" my second character. That character didn't hit 70 until Wrath launched lmao. 
---
I want to blitz a character to 60 because now I'm a grownup with more attention span and vacation time, but I have no problems taking my sweet ass time.
---
I'm doing this too. Swapping skinning at 60 for engineering though. The plan is to save all bars while leveling, but we'll see how that plays out
---
Me Tank, her Heals. I may have my Dad making the leap into Azeroth for the first time too. He expressed an interest and made an account just yesterday!
---
Yes it is. And im not saying it with a bad undertone at all i think hes a cool dude. Still would be nice if blizzard could somehow fix or prevent this.
---
&gt;are you just talking out of your ass
---
Maybe stop being an asshole for a second, and consider that you are the one that lacks perspective here, not me.
---
I'm a professional in the gaming industry, and I know exactly how much damage in-app-purchasing schemes do to families and people with addictive personalities. I've seen the numbers, and I know the outcomes.  
---
You're trying to take an emotional stance over a handful of people who \*could\* scammed by tricks that stopped working a decade ago, and I'm telling you that the damage it would cause is microscopic compared to the damage that micro-transactions would cause to young people and folks with addictive personalities.  
---
Even if what you say is correct, you're suggesting that they implement in-app purchases that makes your character stronger, in a famously addictive game.  
---
Your suggestion would ruin the game, gouge vulnerable people, and cause the game itself to likely tank in popularity to the point of failure, but you're accusing \*me\* of talking out of my ass?  
---
Get the fuck out of here.
---
2 minutes would be way too short imo. With stuff like black lotus it would still be very worth it to abuse the 2 minute CD.
---
The troll racial probably doesn't help much, and really only factors in when you're badly hurt (Berserking). The HP regeneration is negligible. For a mix of PVP and PVE it's really hard to be Tauren's extra hp and war stomp, but also keep in mind enemies can hit you from further away which could be a disadvantage if you're not melee specced (You can hit further as well). I don't think the orc racials will do anything for you in PVE, but the stun resist will come in handy in PVP. Basically I think Tauren is a great choice.
---
Well met
---
We never beat twins or cthun and naxx was a curb stomp we only got a couple bosses flying by the seat of our pants. But like you said people were burning out.
---
OK !! I didn't know that. Merci ;) thanks for the info
---
I think that's great news, even though I think this is another proof that blizzard won't back down on the language specific servers.
---
idk if that necessarily solves the problem though, a full realm is a full realm and if generic realm #1 gets filled and my friend was on that realm, im not going to be able to make my character there but now i have no clue what realm i have to pick that will merge with my friends realm but i understand what youre getting at.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers give a real reward though. They even have quests.
---
The problem is we don’t know what patch a lot of those posts would be referring to. There would be tons of outdated info that wouldn’t apply to 1.12 that would confuse or mislead people.
---
SHARDING OR LAYERING IS NOT PERMANENT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Parries and misses ? Overpower procs of dodges and dodges only.
---
As for your question, I'm not saying don't take Imp Overpower, it's a fine talent. I'm saying don't approach your take on warrior around capitalizing on that specific talent. Basically, don't go DW arms because "I'm gonna get so many Overpower procs, and it's gonna be amazing".
---
Oh, fair enough. You meant, WoW specifically vs playing computer games.  Does she know if you need a few hours left alone for raiding ect? Being up front about schedules is very important to keeping that relationship healthy.
---
The community relationship with Blizzard was already destroyed. This is them trying to repair it. I think people should start giving them credit, now, personally, but I also didn't endure expansion after expansion of poor decisions.
---
Yup, I've got a wife, kid, job, training for powerlifting, and trying to fix up an old car. I'm gonna play when I can, and learn to be more efficient with my time. You make time for the things you want to do.
---
Every server is going to be high population due to layering. There's no option to play on a low pop server. Have you not been paying attention? If they suddenly turn off layering for a queue system, the wait times will be incredibly long.
---
What was it called?
---
From what I understand, I thought the "remastered" version was the same as the "prepare to die" version, which is what they called it when they first released the DLC and PC port in one package.  I could be wrong though.
---
If that's the case, then I already own it haha.
---
Totems are party only and in my experience are general underwhelming in those big battle scenarios. They tend to get killed a lot, or people just move out of their range. I found myself recasting totems a lot.
---
This is what I'm most excited for. As soon as I hit feralas I'm not leaving until I'm exalted with timbermaw
---
not only lifesaving, but can use offensively i.e. to interrupt an enemy's cast
---
If you can't put aside 3-4 hours in a row, you probably can't raid. If you can't raid, I don't know why you would play.
---
I hit 800hr in Stardew Valley before I finally started working again a couple weeks ago. Everything just seems so dry. I've been rotating SDV, Minecraft, and the old Assassin's Creed games again. 
---
But now I come home after 40+ hours during the week and go straight to sleep so I guess time until Classic is passing faster lol?
---
Is there any major difference between Human and Dwarf when it comes to Healing, specifically?   
---
I don't really plan on PVPing in any capacity. So, i'm looking specifically at PVE Healing pros or cons between Dwarf and Human.    
---
Also, at 60, if Raiding is my goal and i'm built around that; how rough is the material farming for a Holy Pally?
---
im sure private server owners will be doing their best to keep people away from blizzards version because they sold gold and boosts on their own servers lol
---
Imgaine PvP is all things PvP because PvP is PvP
---
Really do this if you have the time. They're fun games that get you right up to where Classic begins.
---
Yeah there are definitely still major problems even with a CD.  If they let you layer swap you're still going to be able to layer swap a ton until you find the rare thing you're looking for(gurubashi chest, black lotus spawn, etc), then go get a drink etc until the cd is up and go back at it.
---
If you think your 4th attempt while trying to speedrun it is close to how an average player plays idk what to tell you
---
I've been playing Blizzard games for decades, I've seen way too many rational discussions get ignored in favor of greasing the squeaky wheel.
---
Boomer taking picture of computer with phone.... confirmed vanilla player
---
You can set all that up before the game goes lice just FYI
---
It is not that simple. Vastly reworked private servers (such as Epsilon WoW) are impossible for Blizzard to take down.
---
It's kind of like if I were to take my Monopoly board, throw out all the rules and pieces, and call everyone in town to join me for a new game I made that's using the Monopoly board.
---
There's a reason all-GM servers and such have never been taken down by Blizzard. C&amp;Ds are delivered automatically by law firms who seek out copyright infringements, send a C&amp;D, and that's it. Not complying does absolutely nothing because neither the firm nor Blizzard have very much to argue, because Blizzard's assets are **not** their intellectual property.
---
Blizzard provides the game World of Warcraft, in its entirety, absolutely for free. Their copyright argument is about the content that you cannot download--that is to say, the actual service that you cannot 'download' and that you cannot play, meaning raids, boss mechanics, balance, etcetera.
---
Any private server that reinvents or reworks these can throw C&amp;Ds sent by the outsourced law firms (who just google "&lt;game&gt; private server", look up their ip's host, and send an email without bothering to learn anything about it) can be safely thrown in the trash can.
---
I'd be down for a short cooldown ONLY if you also give players a toggle to stay on a layer for the next X hours.
---
I'm going to be world pvp-ing for the next 4 hours leave me alone please.
---
Live your life for a few days before creating a character
---
Tauren Druid named Convertibull
---
If only Blizzard  would hire you.
---
baron riverdare? i think
---
doable for hardcore fans with years of experience =/= average  
---
Ofc its possible, but the average is not even close to what the world record is lmao
---
This won't fix layer swap camping rare spawns etc. It's a good change, but ultimately layering still needs to get the fuck out ASAP after launch for the economy to not be absolutely fucked from the get go.
---
Just thinking about the Hydraxians is giving me anxiety. So...much...grinding
---
Lol someone who “works in the industry” who conflates the dangers of loot boxes and in-game gambling vs gold-buying in WoW, where after a mount and pre-raid BoEs, gold loses its P2W value inmensely. 
---
Maybe you actually don’t understand the differences? But I’m guessing you do and are just trying to win an argument by conflating distinct systems under the same vacuous P2W label.
---
What are you referring to by "end of phase 1?"  
---
I don't think the majority of people are going to be grinding gold into the tens of thousands. I remember grinding the gold for the mats for TF, and that was roughly 2k which I did in short order. Someone who wants to can easily do so with herbing, which is what I did to get that amount in 2-3 weeks. Someone who wants more could do so with a more concerted effort.
---
Don’t think he would have lost to payo if he was dwarf though :) he plays gnome so he has better odds against mages.
---
When was this changed?  I started playing pre-BC, but not day 1 vanilla and I don't recall any of this.  
---
If what you're saying is true, then what OP is asking is completely impossible.  You can't skip FP B to go A-&gt;C faster because you don't go through B, you literally can't do A-&gt;C.
---
Is that correct?
---
That's not what I've seen personally. Most of the comments at the top of popular threads are reasonable and non-combative. Most of the idiotic or combative comments get downvoted as you would expect from a reasonable community. Those comments do exist, but they don't garner the same amount of upvotes as more reasonable comments do on this sub.
---
Well always make sure that when you're "setting the record straight" that you didn't do it AFTER the hotfix comes in. From the time stamps I gathered there's a chance you (based on upload time) recorded that video after it was hotfixed. Apparently it was only broken for a short time. But it is nice to see that it was fixed.
---
agree with the mount being shit, but tauren have always looked great in armor
---
&gt; VC Van Cleef - Boss of Deadmines instance in Westfall. Sometimes used interchangeably with "Deadmines." (ie. LFG VC is the same as LFG Deadmines.)
---
DM abbrevation did not even exist in the book.
---
You might use those terms, but then I guess classic isn't really for you, because a lot of things in classic are "stupid and broken".
---
If you can't see how being able to predict spells from people and timing them properly to make them waste their CD adds a new layer of skill, then I guess you just aren't a very good PvP player. Not much I can do about that.
---
Could you please ELI5 the meme?
---
I think I heard that  losing your 2h skill is no longer the case for classic.
---
With! It's all we need.
---
the centaur clans have quests and gear
---
the bloodsails only reward is a hat
---
Nah, Alliance might have more quests, but I'm sure the Horde/Goblins would be interested in disrupting communications between SW/IF.
---
Cool =D I hope he gives it a shot. Is he comfortable with computers and such?
---
WotF, 25% stun resist, 10% attack/casting speed, taurens ain't got shit but the other 3 are tight.
---
for them sweet staff crits? you only get the +melee range if youre in caster
---
ctr isnt on pc right?
---
Trial of the Champion was a fun dungeon.
---
Trial of the Crusader was... meh. It felt half-baked, and was right after the best raid ever (which many guilds still hadn't finished). Didn't deserve to be a tier to itself.
---
Will paladins in a raid using bis ever use tier or will it be clown mix all the way?
---
&gt;The 5% to HP is to base HP (not to total) (https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=200094). I suspect strength is the same, but the difference is laughably small early.
---
check your source there, it's 5% to total hp in vanilla and TBC. Later on it was changed.
---
Yes, dps is frequently going to be threat capped even as alliance.  
---
Realize dps gets -20% threat mod, but as alliance you lose windfury on the tank which is quite similar to 20% threat increase.  Functionally it is not quite, the numbers I've seen put it at more like 12% threat increase,  as you lose some of the WF to parry/dodge and a lot of your threat is from damage received rage, and as horde you are more likely to get rage locked and not enough globals to spend it all.  Plus the WF is quite RNG and if you parry streak to start a fight you've got no chance of getting ahead with WF and stunt your raids dps.  
---
It is only with human racials+other paladin buffs that horde can't replicate+you can use sharpening stone as alliance that the threat gap gets to be so insane.
---
I mostly mean BC Raids and BGs but at level 60. I could do without Outlands questing and dungeons.
---
Unless you are in a hardcore PvE guild, it doesn’t matter between dwarf and human. Pick whatever you like better. 
---
For the second question, it won’t be too rough. You’ll be competing for healing gear with the other priests and druids healers but any healing gear that is mail or plate is yours by default.
---
&gt;Immersion breaking, community breaking, invisible loading screens, players/npcs/gameobjects "randomly" going \*poof\* or \*popping out of nowhere\* (and this affects both grinding and questing experience). Look to Blizzard 2004 for why you want an open seamless world in your mmorpg with no invisible walls or loading screens (which sharding and layering both are essentially a "kind of")  
---
&gt;Accidental or Intentional abuse (pvp, resource gathering, griefing etc).
---
I don't think it works like that
---
say layer 1 is full. the next player to enter the server will make a new layer. the players in layer 1 are unaffected and won't even realize another layer is made unless your raid/party happens to be on a different layer and you need to swap -- which isn't a big deal. 
---
the pvp abuse argument is a really dumb take. you don't actually think people will be coordinating parties with their friends across several layers just to avoid open world pvp... on pvp servers.
---
She goes to be a lot earlier than I do. So I get about 2-3 hours per day for my “game time”. Lol.
---
Kargath
---
If you're in a hardcore guild yes, if you're in a normal guild then no. 
---
If gnome calls to you I would play gnome. You shouldn't base your entire game around optimal math unless that's what gets you interested. 
---
I'm saying this as someone who will be rolling human for the wep skill
---
Correct, you need a connecting flight if there is no direct path.
---
Well what's different is that the multi servers are destined to be merged together so you know in advance what other "mulitservers" you will play with. 
---
Something like
---
[Servername] 1
---
[Servername] 2
---
[Servername] 3
---
[Servername] 4
---
You know all these servers will merge when the tourists leave.
---
Cat clown ball mouse
---
I was referring to the context of the conversation which was "a few weeks in" not at launch.  After it gets to the point there are going to be some servers that aren't as high pop as others naturally.  At launch you're just gonna be fucked of course, but after a few weeks such a massive amount of people are going to have already quit playing that the populations are going to start being more averaged out and some servers will definitely have a much lower population than others.
---
Russians are already planning on coming to EU servers anyway.
---
Talk about adding insult to injury.
---
I was 13 when I started playing wow. I leveled a hunter to 60 then re rolled to a mage and raided in a decent guild. I would have to fill in for our class officer who was the main tanks wife. It was such a weird experience having to tell older people what to do as a child even though it was only a game.
---
Path of Exile, Monster Hunter World, ff14
---
Ideally you would find a priest, pally or shaman to quest with making it a moot point. On the server I played I had a priest healing me from 44 to 60 basically. He actually contacted me looking for a warrior since he was holy spec and couldn't do much alone, we didn't talk much but it was cool to have a partner.
---
You have a vivid imagination about how a multi-billion dollar corporation could earn a few hundred dollars in revenue.
---
It depends on what you're doing.  If you're still leveling up, put it at your quest hub.  If you'er working on some rep, or resource, or something else, put it in some relevant location for that.
---
If you're just raiding...well, Horde will put theirs near Blackrock Mountain most likely.  Alliance...maybe Theramore for easy Onyxia access?  Or if you're past the days of Onyxia, then EPL.  Or maybe Silithus for both, if you're focusing on AQ a lot.
---
Magram 4 lyfe.
---
Gelkis can eat sand.
---
I have grown to love Tauren Cat Form
---
Tbh everything is a decent combo unless you're competing for all the same gear
---
Eh, we will have something. Just have to put up with the few negatives in exchange for a smooth launch.
---
Agreed, but it's hard to coordinate schedules all the time. I will try and find a healer though and just storm through things.
---
There were only the PvP titles in vanilla. I really thought Scarab Lord was in before TBC, but turns out it wasn't. "Justicar" and "Conqueror" were also added in TBC.
---
So if I'm unlucky enough to end up on a high population server, I should just start over on a low population server? Never mind my 10+ RL friends that play on the same server as me lol.

You are right there are quests for the centaurs. But they're still essentially equivalent.
---
Taiwan #1
---
Yup, it's only worth it at 60 for the big items - flasks, arcanite bars, rare recipes etc. Filling banks with lvl 30-40 crap is just pointless.
---
Isn’t there a theramore portal?
---
Tauren hitbox in PvP really fucks with me. Tauren is my favorite race, but besides Druid, I feel like the 3 other classes are gimped by having such a huge hitbox. On the flip side, this makes gnomes an attractive race for me for PvP classes
---
? They're TESTING layering. Everything you linked is experimental. Give me proof that actual layering isn't working?
---
If they implemented server merges anyway, they wouldn’t do it overnight and without announcing which servers were getting merged eventually. It’s just Battlegroups all over again. 
---
So multiservers is really just a communication effort with a different name?
---
Doesn’t seem like it requires its own name.
---
Compared to green human, cow human, dead human and ugly human
---
Then they can take a shot for every failed login.
---
if that winds up happening ill just go out with friends nbd
---
Cool! Thank you!   
---
Sorry, i'm pretty naive with the Classic stuff. I don't know how much of an impact stuff like Human's Sword/Mace Specialization or Extra Spirit has and if it's a huge game changer :)   
---
Dun Morogh is my favorite starting zone, so Dwarf Pally it is!
---
It wasn't until I was an adult with my own kids that this clicked for me.
---
"Of course it is. Why would I keep looking after I found it?"
---
&gt; I think one of the reasons they aren't keen to scrap it is because, yeah testers are playing beta to test Classic, but I bet you they are planning on phasing out Sharding on Retail servers and replace it with Layering instead. I think by testing Layering on the Classic beta servers, they are double-dipping Layer testing in preperation for not only the Classic launch, but also to implement it in Retail.
---
My jaw dropped. You are probably right.
---
Uff =/ We only had like 1mb/s when vanilla was launched but upgraded to 10mb/s around when AQ was released. Sweden was top 3 in the world with ADSL / Fibre at that time though.
---
Esh. Never do that man. You'll get annoyed with the broken looking cities, broken looking gear, and the saminess of every single caster and rogue being UD, every warrior being an orc, and tauren not being able to walk into doorways.
---
Sweeping Strikes is 30, and it's infinitely better with a 2H IMO
---
back in the day , you always killed cookie first, because otherwise, the group might break up if they shoulder pull the pat and wipes, or if VC went sour, or non-casters just hearthed after VC.
---
It wasn't until Cookie got moved in retail, now many people are used to retail, or the tank just doesn't want to wait around for the mace wand, and you get tons of people that just skip cookie alltogethor..
---
Don’t you bring Gnomes into this! They got the short end of the stick as it is already ...
---
Indeed.
---
Larger potential for crits in PVP but you will also be more rage starved. I don't think anything will die quickly as druid in PVP but if you play it right you can outlast just about anyone.
---
Can confirm human female mage minus the name
---
Path of Exile and whatever random game in my library catches my eye.
---
No. Must. Finish. Quest.
---
i wouldn't want the BC spells either, the whole instant cast and short cast high damage value spells introduced in BC completely ruined the playstyle of classic wow
---
So from my understanding and I’m not sure it’s much but it’s that if you cast or melee as you and your target are both running it increases the range so you can land the hit? Doesn’t that makes sense mechanically simply due to the fact that if you don’t have it then your character could never finish the animation and it would just get canceled out? Or is that not what this is?
---
I won’t be able to listen to the podcast until tonight so I don’t have much information but that’s just kinda what I make of leeway. To me it just sounds like an animation thing that would feel janky if your swinging of an axe just stuck to a constant range and couldn’t finish if the target dipped out of the range.
---
Could you please explain it to me?
---
Out of curiosity, why do you like that system over layering?
---
Why are all the alliance flagged for PvP? Video is pretty great lol
---
Immersion is an awesome way to learn language.
---
Aww why didn't yo bro let you play an alt? :(
---
I let my 8 yr old sis play whenever I had to do something else she got her undead priest to lvl 20+!
---
All of the immersion breaking arguments are bullshit anyway.  People have always appeared and vanished in WoW.  Take a flight path sometime.  Walk into a raid.  Join a BG.  Mobs respawn by appearing from nowhere.
---
In Naxx you'll start using some tier items. But T1 and T2 are not bis. I'm assuming holy spec.
---
Damn you, Skeletrex!
---
T3 is good. T1-2.5 are in general not very good for holy, but you will probably wear some pieces and quite a few in pvp.
---
There shouldn’t be. Everything blizzard does to make abuse of layers more difficult should go undocumented. Arming the abusers with the rules of the road only gives them a specific guide as to how to break the system again.
---
Didn't he and his dad scam a bunch of people with their company?
---
hi rett ar eadin sn ?
---
No layering /s
---
I think last hitting is a puzzling mechanic (why can one person do 95% of the damage but another player get all the credit?) to include in a game, and I never liked it. Yes, there is skill to it, but it's just feels really dumb.
---
My opinion of course, I'm sure I'm in the minority.
---
Not that much work to type “LFM Mines”
---
They will fix it its beta bro
---
It's Tips, not Esfand.
---
People still listen to him after the whole fraud thing?  Cute.
---
I upvote reasonable requests for change, not whining, but I'm also a reasonable person like I think most people are or we'd see 140k upvotes/downvotes all the time.
---
Noob question: what else is there to do (especially sans PvP for the first 6+ months)?
---
I won’t be raiding. I’m beyond excited for the 27th
---
AKA the alliance
---
K, just don't whine if they don't
---
Correct but some flights have alternate paths.
---
E.g. Astranaar -&gt; Feralas -&gt; thousand needles -&gt; theramore -&gt; gagetzan would still work even if you din't have ratchet, it would just be a longer flight.
---
It's a small investment monetarily. I have been playing a couple hours here and there on a server, got up to 34, had fun. You don't have to play for endgame. The super fickle way U was playing let me amass 40g by level 20 just buy making and selling deviate scale belts and flipping twink items I could afford. So I've been leveling a shaman with a shiny new BoE weapon every couple levels.
---
It probably won't be that different competing for gear. Your weapon will be easier to get for sure, but hunter still has to compete against every rogue and warrior for necklace/rings/trinkets etc.
---
I am just as confused. Perhaps this whole shebang starts when try to to take on a simple level 5 orc shaman? Hilarious results nonetheless!
---
I signed up for Xbox game pass for the PC and I've been playing a ton of Forza Horizon 4 with some Metro Exodus mixed in.
---
I'm not sure how you can get with the goblins afterward but you can get both back into the green. You do all the quests that reduce bloodsail rep first but none of the quests that give Goblin rep and don't reduce bloodsail rep. Then grind bloodsail rep in booty bay until honored. Then farm that one goblin in badlands for weeks to get to 20999/21000 revered then turn in the bloodsail quests to tip into exalted. Then farm mobs in the barrens and tanaris to build rep back up. You can't turn in the repeatable quests as they reduce bloodsail rep. Then do the goblin quests you skipped. I don't think you can get back to exalted with this method but you will get back to at least neutral and given that there aren't any rep rewards for the goblin factions it doesn't really matter.
---
LOL ok so really only one mount then.
---
Winterfall saber trainer?
---
I am not confused, I am wondering how you think you know mages outscale shadow priests, if you have never seen a shadow priest in gear equivalent to T2+.
---
Is it possible that what you have actually seen is that anyone in tier 2+ stomps anyone without it?
---
&gt; Additionally, mathematically, the soellpower coefficients of their spells scales way worse, which can be viewed in the source code.
---
Since you haven't seen Blizzard's source code, I imagine that all of this is based on pirate server stuff.
---
I heard alli is reluctant when it comes to defending from wpvp, so there's that.
---
The problem is that it is extending melee range to a ridiculous degree, like 11 yards.  In the pod cast it was described as not really leeway as existed in vanilla wow, but instead a combat range increase mechanic that was added in Cata.  In any event it appears seriously broken atm.
---
Someone said about the centaur clans that they kinda cap out at Honored, but that you can get tricksy and reach Revered with one of them. How does that all work then? Is Exalted impossible?
---
Only need it equipped for 30s for the CD on the use to be ready. After using a charge(s) you can switch to another weapon
---
Fair enough, I guess my memory is wonky after all these years.
---
Just have 911 on standby for a stomach pump.
---
I'm playing Paladin, which in Vanilla, was Alliance only.  I played a dwarf pally in Vanilla, but I haven't decided yet if I should go Human this time around.
---
I've been playing loottttss of Ability Draft. Only thing my RL friends and I play anymore lol. So glad they made release after TI9. Wish I could go again sometime, watching the games in the crowd is intense
---
I keep saying, BC as the post Naxx content, but no level cap increase and make the units elites. See if a 40 man raid can defeat the black temple at lvl 60 by getting there first.
---
&gt; xaxaxa pra ustedes
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Take your assumptions elsewhere, I don't need or care for them. The only way classic won't "really be for me" is if they don't fix this melee leeway. As we're no longer on dialup a leeway this gigantic isn't wanted or needed.
---
Raiding is such a small part of the game.
---
Smart, even the "class tourism" is part of the classic charm. I didnt  hit 60 till my 3rd server i had several 20 somethings before falling in love with Mage
---
Love the idea of introducing non lvl 60 content! Fresh stuff to try, while not disrupting end game
---
As a US player seeing this I gotta say this sucks for you guys
---
I bet this has already been suggested but what if the EU community just started posting everywhere something like this
---
Servers listed alphabetically
---
1st:English
---
2nd:French
---
3rd:Spanish
---
4th:German
---
and so on(I'm an inbred US player I have no idea how many actual languages ya gotta deal with)
---
at least if it's posted anywhere you can most people who frequent online forums about classic should see it, and can hopefully join a server with others who saw it and speak the language
---
My old raiding guild is getting back together and they picked Saturday nights as their main raiding night. I told them I would not be joining them the first couple of months for MC because it will be football season. But I'm also pretty sure I won't be 60 before the new year.
---
Sounds like Tate is jealous
---
When you change the weapon you lose the buff
---
I think it would be good to at least make a list of servers certain nationalities will congregate to and post it here.
---
So that us players from smaller countries can avoid the predominantly non-english speaking servers.
---
I bet his favorite flavor is Crow after that "You think you do but... you dont." nonsense, Christ can you imagine how much embarrassment he had to swallow to walk out on stage to be the one to announce that? I would have chocked to death.
---
Crash team racing just got released, so that. Will occupy me for a few weeks
---
\&gt;saminess
---
Human, short human, shorter human, blue human
---
Furthermore, the amount of soy guzzling required to unironically play alliance isnt healthy
---
I'm almost completely certain that even if you do every nelf rep quest while leveling you're still only going to be partway through revered. Gotta morrowgrain or cloth it up sometime.
---
Just make sure you are allowed to roll on your main spec gear.
---
Some guilds might insist on youre a healer first, off tank second
---
I like that glass-is-half-full outlook.
---
I would just do whatever seems fun to you.  That’s it.  You’ll get to 60 in any spec as long as you don’t quit.  
---
In my experience, warrior is the number one class in terms of different opinions on how to do what.  Ask 10 people how to level a warrior and you’ll get 6 different answers. 
---
I personally can’t live without piercing howl as it saves my butt countless times while leveling, and I save tactical mastery for a later respec when the dungeons start getting a little harder. I prefer to stay fury for rage generation in the earlier dungeons.  Oh, and obviously I don’t take mortal strike - it’s good and all, I would just rather dual wield or just use whatever 2 hander I have with mostly fury talents.  
---
At 60 I go with a tanking fury/arms/prot hybrid until I get decently geared and then switch to a raid spec and just try to make it work in pvp when I do that.  
---
Point being - just do whatever feels good to you.  I don’t min max till later raid tiers because nothing pre AQ really requires it in my opinion.
---
Agree here. I run a trade company, wife, 2 kids, been lifting for 12 years or so, and still have time to game a decent amount. I make sure I hustle doing anything - laundry, cooking, things around the house, etc.
---
 That also doesn't mean I neglect the wife or the kids. The kids get some play time, wife gets some hangout time, we eat together, then when the kids go to bed I either play games for 2-3 hours, or workout then play however much time I have left.
---
 It baffles me when people who are single complain about not having time. Boy, are they in for a rude awakening lol
---
Have you ever been to europe? Nobody is asking for a server for every language, only for german/french/spanish maaaybe italian.  
---
Why would I (english speaker) want a server filled with german speaking guilds? when there clearly is enough german people to sustain more than once server..
---
I will sure do. Thanks sir
---
Looks amazing! I've been wanting to do this but have no idea where to start..lol. Where can I find a frame with the cut outs like that?
---
Lumping in the Magram and Gelkis clans together? Wow. Just Wow. I can't believe the insensitivity of some people.

Yeah, nerd
---
Back in TBC to early WotLK I mained and Undead Rogue named "Boogers". How I managed to get that name was beyond me since I played on a fairly populated server.
---
It doesn't seem like we're making much headway here, so I'm gonna duck out of this thread.  
---
The good news is that wow tokens will not be in Classic, so you can just be upset about it while I enjoy the game immensely.  
---
See you around.
---
Humans will have a lot of benefits over dwarves for healing.
---
1. If you are applying a judgement on the target, I believe (and could be wrong) that it uses melee stats, in which case +5 weapon skill may help.
---
2. 5% spirit won't be useful while casting, but it will help if you have a chance to regen, and at the very least you'll drink faster.
---
3. Reputation gains are significantly faster, which can get you access to certain things quicker.
---
Dwarves have Stoneform, which is more about saving mana than getting rid of poisons, since you can cleanse poisons.  The extra armor won't help much against spells, but could be useful as a last-ditch effort if you get aggro. 
---
Overall, I'd strongly lean dwarf, but it's a lot less than I'd lean dwarf for going priest.
---
If your goal is Naxx, then Hunter.
---
Elemental Shaman won't have the mana, and you're going to need 8 warrior tanks.
---
&gt;the pvp abuse argument is a really dumb take. you don't actually think people will be coordinating parties with their friends across several layers just to avoid open world pvp... on pvp servers.
---
You underestimate the will and desire of some for abuse. I've seen people go out of their way to grief other for days, weeks, even months. Some targeted people (streamers) will definitely be looking to avoid this.
---
taladrils guide is awesome, recommend it highly to anyone wanting to tank as druid in Classic.
---
I think I'll roll mage, but if I happen to drop one I'll be selling that shit. It'll go as hot cakes and it's not even that good.
---
Songstone of Ironforge loses you 3 frost spell power 7int 4spirit and it's a quest reward.
---
Maiden's Circlee loses you 3 frost spell power but gains 7int 6spirit and won't be as expensive since it's a blue
---
Also Freezing Band won't survive Molten Core, since Ring of Spell Power is just flat out better, so forking out several hundreds of golds for a ring that won't even last to phase 2 seems stupid to me.  
---
I'd rather buy my guild a Nightfall.
---
Warlock can't go to a dungeon if there's a priest or a mage.
---
Priest can't go to a dungeon unless they heal.
---
Yeah but hasnt played a video game since Gran Turismo 3 lol. This is gonna be a lot of learning for him xD
---
I mean on a pserver I recently played on there was someone who had a lvl 60 in under 3 days play time. Granted they probably abused the dynamic spawn times and had a friend or someone playing when they slept ( that's my guess) they still leveled that fast. It was insane haha.
---
Oof. Heard.
---
&gt; Wait you are complaining when you guys did not even kill C'thun........Hell TGP, IE and P4L were better than you guys. You lost all ability to complain.
---
Incredible logic there, I salute you.
---
&gt; But hey looking at your guys progression, you fell off hard after a strong start........
---
Using progression as a diss when you've just spent the last 24 hours trying to justify your cheating, even better logic
---
&gt; As for my dates We formed in,
---
"In the beginning of the guild we did it 4 or 5 times a week."
---
So if the above is true then you were cascading at the "beginning of the guild" which was October, November and December.
---
&gt; looks like we passed you by then, prior to cascading.
---
This doesn't check out if by your own admission your guild was made up of people that couldn't kill Rag.  
---
&gt;  Then in December to early Jan we cascaded for about a month until it was corrected
---
Which again doesn't correlate with "Yes. a clear would take 4-5 hours. This was while we waited for AQ40 to open."  because the AQ war effort didn't start until January 06.
---
You spilled the beans on your exploiting and you're so proud of your progression that you've spent 24 hours trying to justify it.  This isn't washing.
---
But yeah, keep bragging about how your cheating helped you progress further than a guild that didn't cheat.
---
(4 hours later)
---
Eventually people will complain, probably weeks after official release, when they have reached level +40 and try to unsuccessfully reenact their beloved macros in classic. But it is too late even now to fight for this. Damn I enjoy coding my macros the most in vanilla.
---
I want to die
---
Yeah you right, I'm thinking from a feral tank perspective where I can let the buff roll off after I have enough threat
---
LMAO at the free space.
---
This is really cool.
---
Do you mean me or Sbeve?
---
Layer is proving itself to be a complete shitshow
---
Just make a mega server already, we will survive
---
&gt; Generally football fans are not your normal group that play games like WoW, so I was EXTREMELY surprised that so many people upvoted and commented
---
That's just wrong.  I'm a huge football fan and wow fan, practically everyone on both my high school football team and our rivals football team played wow, and esfand also played wow.  You r just generalizing based on older fans
---
oh tbc.
---
Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I'm hoping to be done farming gold and pre-raid BiS by the time Phase 2 rolls out. I suppose prime targets would be enemy players at level 57-59 who are in the middle of grinding mobs or quests to hit 60. They'll be underleveled, undergeared, and pre-occupied with whatever mob they're fighting.
---
Guess I'll look at some Alliance leveling guides to see where folks will be in the 57-59 range.
---
Hunter is better at solo grinding and is one of the best kiters in the game, especially against a single target.  Warlocks have more options when things go south in solo, other than resetting the encounter with Feign Death.  On things that are not immune to fear, Warlocks can very easily solo them, but at the risk of aggroing more enemies.
---
The hunter deserves the credit I wish his name was in the title.  I was watching SS stream at the time before bed but saw that the hunter was streaming as well which was much more interesting watching from his perspective rather than the warlock.  Plus SS (and many other streamers) seem to have this need to talk constantly and not have "dead air" and this hunter was chill. 
---
Wish I could find his name but I've forgotten and I can't watch the vid here =P  Someone post his name please!
---
Elemental is not a viable raiding spec, even if you wore all mage gear you do not have the mana to not oom every fight.  
---
Feral tanks are somewhat niche.  Typically they are DPS that offtank in raids.  Their viability is debatable, I would guess you will see one druid tank even every 3-4 guilds, this is a very difficult raid position to obtain if you don't have any previous experience.  
---
Hunter is the default pick on this list.
---
I see he starts Undead for this.
---
If I'm starting troll priest, any idea what the first humanoids I can grind on for cloth would be?
---
Without sounding stupid, i think from when the original game was released. Night Elves didn't have hair colour option for Black Hair. But don't take my word for it, i could very well be wrong. It might just be a disabled in beta, and the enabled for release. But i really can't tell for certain.
---
Female is much more popular now, and the unpopular races in general are much more popular (dwarf/troll). It's really just the difference between 13-15 year olds playing and 25-30 year olds playing. The *fantasy* of being a hero is less strong, people just choose something nice to look at.   
---
There will be vastly less male nelfs than there was in vanilla.
---
Thats me now, rolled Restosham in Cata and havent changed since. 
---
I think it helps Rsham is functionally unchanged too as otherwise i might have left during pruning
---
(Rip manatide tho)
---
Nothing wrong with 2 hunters.
---
Warrior is incredibly complex.  You have to stance dance and all that jazz.
---
&gt;Parries and misses ? Overpower procs of dodges and dodges only.
---
Well yes, obviously. But in your math you were calculating overpower to be 5% of your swings (every dodge-&gt;overpower). Which is incorrect as it implies the other 95% would hit. They won't because there's also misses and parries to take into account, neither of which deal any damage at all. 
---
I agree in regard to your point though.
---
Yea I think a lot of people underestimated him and flagged by attacking. Not exactly sure though we only see these clips. He has all those buffs from pots, 100 hp to chest, fiery on his weapon.
---
I'm a space bar pleb :(
---
Nah iam fine either way tbh
---
I mean if they lie to us with their intentions on what to fix and when to turn of layering all complaining wont change anything either way imho.
---
I either sub or not.
---
I remember playing for the first time at a friends house about a week or two into the launch of Vanilla.  I was so mesmerized that I immediately asked my dad if I could have the game as an early birthday present.  After I created my first character, nightelf rogue, I made my way to the lag pit known as Ironforge.  It was soooo bad I ended up asking my friend to log into my account and get me to Stormwind.  Now I’m prepared.  Can’t wait for L Day V2!
---
Press print screen
---
Did you miss the news on layering?
---
maybe they will just be happy to finally run into another guild that speaks their language on an unofficial language server.  that connection would be five times as valuable, since they have ran into so many unofficial languages they don't associate with or understand.
---
Then you get rolled by a mage and goldfish memory to mage only to get stunlocked by a rogue, then you do rogue, then you get feared and drained by a lock, then you go lock, and you get smacked down by a ret pally, and then you go ret pally and realize all this porn needs downloading.
---
&gt; pure gold
---
3 gold and 25 silver to be exact.
---
You should probably put weapon damage/speed on there.
---
We had Twins on farm, but there was a HUGE increase in difficulty between Twin Emperors and C'thun.  In fact, I still to this day believe that C'thun was the hardest boss in the game.  I didn't get to play the end of Naxx, so obviously I can't be 100% certain on that, but I do remember one of the top guilds on my server downed Kel' Thuzad, but never downed C'thun.
---
Hello friends! I have a fairly simple dilemma as opposed to most.
---
I am currently torn between warrior and mage! I need you guys to help me tip the balance. 
---
I am a pvp focused sweat-monger going for r14 and of course some raid progression.
---
    WARRIOR PROS
---
• metal music plays in my head when I charge
---
• my girl is going healbot at 60
---
• the aesthetic 
---
     WARRIOR CONS
---
• struggle vs. mages(this is my number one issue)
---
• I don’t plan on raiding enough to gear two specs but I have MT and OT exp
---
• I am very self-reliant as my girl is PvE focused
---
• carpal tunnel
---
   MAGE PROS
---
• Been my main since vanilla(non factor in preference I am speaking more to my muscle memory)
---
• Self-reliant 
---
• Aoe and gold farm(portals)
---
• I like tilting people and have good patience in pvp situations
---
   MAGE CONS
---
• boring rotation and leveling process
---
• aesthetic
---
• cookie cutter build
---
You can see I am leaning towards mage at the moment; albeit more slightly than you think. 
---
 PLEASE let me know if I have any misconceptions in my list. This post will be the nail in the coffin on who I pick. Thanks guys!
---
Sorry for wall of text and poor formatting.
---
Guild Bank is probably the only one I care about, rest is meh.
---
Some sections like this that are in "no zone" spawn you in the default GY for your faction, which is Westfall for Alliance and Crossroads for Horde. You can also end up in Westfall if you die in the sea north of Moonglade, I think.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ__nRnO2mE
---
I'm going to downvote something extreme, because it's nonsensical and undermines a genuine concern or issue.
---
I want the new models as well! They look so much better.
---
Legion wasn’t praised and seen as good until they remade or fixed a few things that people complained a lot about on the forums.
---
&gt;	Warlock can't go to a dungeon if there's a priest or a mage.
---
Cmon, thats completely false.
---
Yeah sorry guess I didn't make it clear enough, I'm not talking about at launch, just in general going forward choosing a server if they did the queue and got rid of layering after a couple weeks would come down to not choosing a high pop server. You could very well just get fucked by choosing the wrong server at launch, but if you look around a bit to see where the big draw streamers/guilds are going to be rolling, you can make an educated guess on which servers will end up having the lower queues so you don't get screwed over later. (I do think people are highly over estimating how many people stick around with classic though. So many people want to jump on the "going back to the old ways" hype, but in practice, after the initial hype dies and we're a few weeks in, massive amounts of players will just stop logging in. We'll still have a pretty healthy population of people playing imo, but I don't think the hell of every server being high population/queued at all times will be anywhere close to reality.
---
Finally got back to my corpse!
---
&gt;not because I don’t like the challenge but it’s difficult to find people to stick with it after just one death.
---
This is what I'm most afraid of in classic WoW. Back in the day when you got a group together it usually stuck together until the job was done or it was painfully obvious it wasn't doable. With modern WoW (and modern gaming culture in general) people will ditch after one failure.
---
&gt;Hope you’ve got a 5ghz cpu as it’s running on one core.
---
Honestly this game has way less going on for it even on max. So it should not be an issue unless the cpu is garbage.
---
Lmao at all the goldfarmers QQing here. This is a great change.
---
1. Type /invite
---
2. Shift-click on the name of the player
---
3. Copy and paste the name that gets inserted into chat, into the ticket body.
---
No, that's not as convenient as RCR-- but it's far from untenable.  If someone is really being shitty, it's still a process that takes less than 30 seconds.  Not a big deal, and that's essentially the point:  There _should_ be a mild deterrent in place to discourage players reporting other plays for frivolous things.  It's a self-moderating system that is perfect for a game like Classic, which has a more limited set of resources than retail but does not fit a mold in which automation is an acceptable substitute.
---
I should note that I don't think this is a situation that will come up very often when you're out in the game world, as most people don't have special characters in their names.
---
I don’t know what to tell you man, I knew of one other kid who played Vanilla on my football team.
---
Of my 10 buddies that are all big football fans, I am the only one that every touched WoW.
---
I will see you on the battlefield of desolace.
---
Either the humanoids at kul tiras quest, or the quilboars for that quest.
---
Hopefully. Bring on the frames.
---
I really don't. it's a fun thing to say that "oh you underestimate these people" etc etc, just no
---
There are lots that wouldn’t affect anything but I think that slippery slope is a big fear.  
---
For me, map coordinates, auto dismount (you can effectively do it with macros so it’s just actually an advantage for people using macros in classic), auto loot, but I mean I would even be fine with guild banks etc, I get why they are being left out though.
---
I always had a ball playing AV with my hunter in 2005. You have 41 yards to work with and can cycle Aimed Shot -&gt; Multi Shot -&gt; Arcane Shot -&gt; Autoshot. With crit% in the 27-30 range and the 0/21/30 talent build for pvp, you can obliterate cloth-wearers with that one combo. I have tons of old screenshots of AV and AB leaderboards with my dude topping the chart.
---
Hunters are ace in wPVP, too. Too bad you don't care about that. ;-)
---
I would accept Guild banks. Saves people from just mailing a bunch of stuff to an alt.
---
The youtube video I saw showed  some news articles that stated in approx. 2011/2012, their company had a major contract with a public entity in California, that their work was ABYSMAL, and that they had billed out about 90% of the contract before even beginning work. As far as I know though, this was resolved in a private dispute resolution process, not a court of law. As far as I know the company was dismantled. Not sure what the actual damage at the end of the day to the public entity was.
---
So yeah, he's associated with a pretty serious allegation of fraud, and generally, I do not support any of his content for that reason. My only point was that dismissing this piece of information just because its "some fucking streamer" isn't very logical.
---
Hothotrun - resto druid
---
 Dotdotrun - warlock
---
Yeah we'll definitely find a server that unofficially our language, it's just if it's not official, not everyone will know about it :/
---
&gt; Rest of week will be spent listening while driving.
---
I've been going crazy because the official site while driving keeps having audio cut out and I think it has something to do with my phone but to my pleasant surprise I found Countdown to Classic is also on Spotify so im fairly psyched
---
&gt;	A low-level (i.e. 12-16 dungeon) for Alliance characters, possibly a barrow-dens in Darnassus
---
I know you’re just spitballing here, but i cant imagine anyone other thna night elfs going to the trouble of running that instance. its just such a pain in the ass to get to Darnassus at that level.
---
Hey all! I’ve decided to play alliance rogue, but i’m very torn on which race i should pick. I’m going to do plenty of PvPing but also a decent amount of PvEing - maybe 60% pvp and 40% pve. I will also go engi + mining. Any knowledgable person that can educate me of the perks with each race?
---
&gt;(why can one person do 95% of the damage but another player get all the credit?)
---
Because they outplayed you by either better creep management or timing. Usually both. Yes it's possible to be outplayed and as unfun as that is it also allows the possibility of outplaying the other guy as well. It's entirely fair.
---
Guild wars 1 😂, 
---
...but seriously I love that game. 
---
GW PvE is weak AF in comparison to WoW. But I have yet to find pvp formats as engaging and entertaining as guild vs guild and hall of heros.
---
Do you have the setting "max/min forground fps" on? If so turn both those settings off in the advanced settings. These settings for whatever reason completely tank fps and do not allow it to reach what it could. I had them set for my 144hz monitor in retail and I could never get over 100fps. I turned them off and BAM 350 fps with settings cranked. So definitely check this out!
---
Ugh, not russians, come on.....
---
Hahah what a great guild name. GET OUT OF MY FOREST!
---
Its mostly healing in a group, and reincarnation is so good for saving wipes.  Healing and supporting the tank with totems is perfectly fine with men. Also, since reincarnation saves wipes you can get a dps slot easy when there is already a priest.
---
Never killed Twin Emperors before I could solo that whole shithole, so I wouldn't know.
---
But man, wiping on Twin Emperors was the worst.
---
It doesn't work like that, Layering is not a 1:1 replacement for login queue.  
---
Assume a layer "cap" of 3000, that doesn't mean it goes to full then the next 5 players will be on a desolate layer with 5 players in the entire continent.  
---
That would be dumb and they will never implement it like that (both from a gameplay perspective and an economic one, spinning up a layer that can hold 3k just for 5 is a waste of money).  
---
What is happening instead is that either there is a "yellow" status where population is say 2.500 and trending up and they start shuffling players to layer2 or more likely when a layer reaches "capacity" they split it down the middle (preserving groups, guilds + friendlists as possible) and keep adding to both so population is more or less evenly spread out.  
---
We know that some layer hopping is happening without group invites from a bunch of streamer clips.   
---
Dynamic population re-balancing is the most likely reason.
---
fair enough
---
Or it’s further down their to-do list than other, more common bugs/exploits. People did this in Vanilla, but it was relatively rare. You’re assuming intent because you want it to be true, but that’s not a reasonable way to approach this.
---
On my first character (priest) I found that mansion and got super excited. I thought it was a class hall where all rogues would meet up. I figured that if rogues had one, then all the others did too. I was dissapoint.
---
You can just set it to invisible, you don't even need to drag it out of view.  There are also addons that let you keybind directly to the macro panel or the spellbook.
---
ACTIVISON HAS KILLED CLASSIC! ILL BE GOING BACK TO PRIVATE SERVERS. IMAGINE ACTUALLY BELIEVING BLIZZARD IS GOING TO FIX THIS. BLIZZARD SHILLS DEFENDING LAYERING.
---
isn't that run the same for both?
---
I mean idk about you, but both of my kids have been while my wife was on BC and I pulled out. So not all of us can go blowing the fire extinguisher directly into the flame lol
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
To be clear, Shield Block prevents crushing blows, not crits.  A blocked attack can crit.  However, a blocked attack cannot be a crushing blow.  You still need defense cap to push off crits.
---
Yeah, that run is really painful. After you kill emps, you can walk past C'thuns room and end up right near the start, iirc.
---

Some level 8 paladin fun
---
!remindme 2 months
---
AoE looting has quite signficant changes to aoe farming, I think something like it being easier to loot stacked mobs is better(in vanilla it was very difficult to loot stacked mobs which was frustrating).
---
pet/mount tab isn't needed as mounts and pets isn't really something you collect
---
Guild bank is a good one
---
auto dismount and a proper map from the get go is nice.
---
One thing is important to mention about this,  horde pugs wreck alliance. Mostly because all specs of shaman heal their bros and all rets do not.
---
I'm pretty encouraged by this, just read up on the Stance Dancing you described, I'm glad I asked the thread because I've gotten some really helpful answers. Thank you!
---
"There are other things you can do in the game you know"
---
When I say I was unable to farm mobs or do quests.
---
We’re in the endgame now
---
&gt; What are you referring to by "end of phase 1?" 
---
I'm referring to the first 6 months.
---
Welp, there goes 4 hours of my day. Sorry about that!
---
You cannot be crushed with block, but you can be crit.
---
With an mmo's mouse with the 12 thumb buttons plus ctrl shift and alt you really shouldn't need anything more... I can comfortably play retail 1 handed with EITHER hand and switch back and forth depending what I'm doing in game and what I need to free a hand for
---
As a NE hunter, I will always grind timbermaw hold. I remember possibly using a lower level reward, but doing it for the sole sale of feeling bad for the guys.
---
What was hard about priest on BFA for you:
---
If disc, that might be understandable.  BFA disc is very counter intuitive.  Classic priest will not play like that at all.  There is far less aoe in classic, and priest is the best aoe healer, whereas disc in BFA has to weave healing and damage to do effective aoe healing.  
---
If holy, in BFA holy priest is great overall healer but sucks at high M+ tank healing, so if you were in situations where the tank just exploded on you that might be understandable.  I would say that experience is somewhat classic like in that while you are a better tank healer compared to the other healers in classic, tanks spike and take more damage generally in vanilla.  Tanks have no self healing, and their only defensive CDs are extremely long, so you are basically the only thing keeping them from exploding.

This is a bandaid fix, lazy. What if I queue with someone, they hop off and I queue with someone else? Can't do that!
---
Should put a level limit on it. Hot trash.
---
What do you think of the idea Murko
---
I'm starting to think I should just jog to Org and see if anyone puts some up right out of the gate. 
---
Seems tough to get the mats in The Barrens.
---
I'd be surprised if any additional content they add (new or old) isn't accompanied by a set of fresh classic only servers.
---
Think it uses same hitbox?  I remember I couldn't fit through gaps on tauren by shapeshifting, I was still same size even though I was in catform or whatever
---
Do people even PvP as BM? Didn't seem like it to me.
---
Mounts as inventory items force making the choice (for better or worse depending on the individual) of what to keep in your bags, what to keep lovingly in your bank forever and what to delete.
---
Not saying one system is better than the other, but pointing out that there's always more to simple QoL changes than first appears.
---
50, getting there is the hard part. Everything after that is pretty simple.
---
would min/maxxer virgins be the gnomes for the 5% int?
---
I dunno I guess I need to see a top tier hunter and Druid go at it.
---
Would be interesting to see.
---
Aaaahahahaa, what a resentful little 5 footer you are, keep on chugging on your day job, spend all your money on crap and keep your loans high,you might make it one day brother.
---
They've known it was in the game since vanilla, it would have taken them 5 seconds to blockade it. Maybe you want it to be false
---
&gt; You would also be taking the sword [...] as a human.
---
Is that true though, even with the better damage range on the axe and the crit from Axe spec's interplay with Deep Wounds?
---
Weapon skill is nice, but those are two pretty significant factors.
---
I don't care about the launch, I care about the quality of the game long term.
---
"Balanced" is the problem. We don't want classes that can do everything themselves. We want each class to be strong against AND weak against something.
---
plus an extra helping of virgin ;)

---
I usually get bitched at by folks but I think an OSRS approach to the game would be stellar.
---
I'm all for having no change servers. But I'd love for servers that balanced classes differently, or added some modern flair in the old system.
---
Frankly, I'd kill to see Ascenion style servers too.
---
They have such a rich tapestry the community has already built, itd be a shame if we didn't get to use it.
---
Guild bank, enemy cast bar, enemy target frame.
---
I started playing a month after release and waited in queues.
---
I know. I was worried about that too, so at least I'm skipping all the cutscenes lol
---
OK... if you want to count for parries and misses that makes the 5% dodge 5/90 hits. Which is 5,55% of your hits, which leaves us as 25% of 5,55 which is 1.38% dps increase. So I was 0.13% off.
---
If you want to break this down into the absolute minute math I'm sure my estimate was off, but then you also have to account for the fact that you already have increased dps from crit, and adding crit on top of crit means that it's not quite 1% dps per 1% crit, and you have bonus damage from abilities that reduces the portion of your dps that normal swing damage is (which overpower technically is). etc etc. It's an estimate, it's meant to be indicative.
---
Alliance Priest: *mind controlls you*
---
That doesn't really impact wether there will be pugs or not and you don't exactly need to be good to clear raids. Not being completely retarded should be enough, which applies to probably at least half of the playerbase I'd say. 
---
The question is, how big the servers will be once layering is over. Private servers have much higher cap than what Vanilla servers used to have and if blizz goes with a cap similar to Vanilla that might have an impact on pugs because all you really need is 20-40 people to clear raids and with 1/3-1/5 population it will be more difficult get a raid started.
---
I really wouldn't mind if there aren't any pugs they weren't a thing in Vanilla, playing classic without a guild seems pretty dumb to me to be honest.
---
&gt; Is that true though, even with the better damage range on the axe and the crit from Axe spec's interplay with Deep Wounds?
---
What crit and what deep wounds? You're level 10. You've got 1 talent. You take the sword because weapon speed doesn't matter since you only have heroic strike/rend and you've already leveled up sword skill.
---
This guide assumes you're soloing everything without being carried/grouping for the Whirlwind Weapon quest. If people can manage to score a weapon, then so be it. But Elite Quests lie outside the scope of this guide as a "Worst-Case Weapon Progression".
---
#*SMELLS WORSR OVER HERE THAN A DOZEN ROTTEN EGGS DROPPED IN A VAT OF VINEGAR*
---
In a straight up fight to the death that's a whole different story, I'm strictly talking about getting away from a hunter. Druids are the masters of running away.
---
You are right, I misread your comment and my brain jumped straight to the Whirlwhind quest.
---
Auto-Dismount when using abilities. So many people are just going to use a macro to recreate this feature for their relevant abilities. If this were just included by default I don't think it would change much.
---
I think it means the devil is hunting you
---
Same with pets, toys, etc. These things taking up an inventory slot combined with smaller bags means you actually have to make conscious decisions about what you have on you and what you carry with you, as opposed to just having access to everything at once.
---
I'm hoping to get around 15 - 20 real life friends to play, then fill in the gaps from there.
---
This was still true for TBC... class homogenization started with WotLK.
---
Man, how friendly. I’m sure you will be a big supporter of a positive classic community.
---
Yeah! That game is awesome. It really did make the world more gritty. Seeing a skeleton or a corpse of a person makes me think: "I wonder how their story ended?" and I try to piece it together from the surrounding mobs etc. And that way, I learn not to make the same mistake that guy did. It really does add more than just detail
---
I would take the Mace over the Sword as a Human. Humans get +5 to both Maces and Swords, and the Mace has a higher Base Damage range for higher DPS on Heroic Strike.
---
I am one of a handful of lunatics that wanted WoW to stop right at the introduction of the honor system (or even before) and pre-BG's.
---
Shaman expectations:  I played paladin and mage in vanilla and enjoyed both very much. For the level 90 expansion I was a shaman to try to get the best of both worlds there and that was a great compromise for me.  I especially enjoyed being able to use most of the same gear for elemental as for resto and felt pretty good at both roles.  Should that work out okay in Classic for me?  I definitely won't have as much time to play this go around, so I will need to place my bets wisely. Thanks!

---
They need something to bitch about. The abuse on the beta right now is 10x worse (if not more) than anything we will see on live. Why? Because there are 600 concurrent players on the beta but for a long time there was 6+ layers (if not many more) to hop between. Thats 100 players per layer versus 2-3k players per layer. Its blown out of proportion and nobody can use their heads. Will there be some videos or twitch clips of people doing stuff with layers that they werent meant for? YES! Does this mean that the layers are broken? NO!
---
You?
---
IIRC you still end up turning in runecloth for the last chunk anyway.
---
Just adding more info to the discussion, not trying to kill anyone’s joy. I think it’s worthwhile to point out the ways in which +2 spirit being “very important” is relative to what level you’re playing the game at
---
Twins in AQ40 before they introduced the teleport. That was brutal.
---
If I remember correctly that is a one time use it. I don't think it is reusable.
---
They are virgins and want to impress people on the internet by pretending they have a loving girlfriend because god knows they don't in real life.
---
You're vapid.
---
Shoulda read 'the light and how to swing it', by Uther.
---
&gt;Yes there will be effect of layering but to completely destroy the idea of cohesive world is a bit extreme.
---
You people and Blizzard always underestimate the effects things like this have over time.  LFG, flying mounts, and more.  Never seeing the same players not only hurts immersion, but it hurts the social aspect and game experience.  My little post was supposed to show a simple, memorable situation that layering would make near impossible, yet none of you pro-layering people have anything to say about acknowledging that layering would destroy that kind of organic story that was a central part of vanilla.
---
&gt;I could give you unlikely examples of Illidan 1, 2, 3 solution as well.
---
Not sure what you are referring to here.
---
Leeway and Spell Batching.
---
Once those get addressed, I think we can safely assume the community will find something new to hate.
---
You take the sword because you already have sword skill leveled up. Damage range doesn't matter at all for heroic strike. In fact, faster weapons are better with heroic strike, because you get full benefit from the ability and you use less of a swing timer in doing so.
---
Yeah, precise melee ranges would bring back amazing gameplay.  
---
I remember mages kiting hunters at 5-8 too, it's so cool to watch.
---
Its made by literally the same dude who designed SOTN. It was a kickstarter project.
---
The only other thing I know of that has some sort of healing is the Crusader Enchant.
---
Guild bank, 20 slot main backpack, link item into AH search bar.  Dungeon meeting stone- maybe requiring 3-4 people so you don't have to wait for that one replacement.
---
Thats actually not true. Spirit scales way better than strength does for AP.  With 70 points of spirit you are getting WAY more value out of spirit then if you had strength instead.
---
For example 150 strength  is worse to have than 80 strength and 70 spirit.
---
I doubt that's a good option tbh, it takes a while for people to start selling their first stuff. But grinding quilboars doesn't really seem bad to me.
---
If that’s true it’ll release 6566 days after wow was announced
---
Did you stop playing because of the queues?  
---
Or did you stop playing because Blizzard added QoL improvements that hurt world cohesion, social interaction, and immersion?
---
I have been playing alot less. But I'm not going to level any more. 7 days /played is enough for me. lol
---
Never played Alliance...
---
Go back to quests that can be done by level 5's. People would be stuck on level 3-4 while you're a step ahead.
---
You have a healer girl? Go warrior
---
Diablo 3 hardcore seasonal, sea of thieves, and working on 1-12 routes on Pslights Pslope Pslilver Psland.
---
Yesterday? I feel like it was 10 years ago 😂
---
Nice band name too
---
Auto loot is in the beta options. Holding shift when you loot isnt that hard tho. Guild bank is a big one that I think people dont realize they will miss.
---
This post wins the day!
---
Thank you very much! That's incredibly useful. Do druids ever fill a roll other than its healer spec, or is that considered pretty niche?
---
How far back you want to go?  War of the ancients?  Just the main events prior to vanilla wow?  
---
Warcraft reign of chaos and the frozen throne will show you that.
---
That is not true. Heroic strike is based off of weapon damage and slower weapons *will* hit for more. However it *is* true that in unlimited rage scenarios that Heroic Strike is better with faster weapons. At level 10 though rage is *anything* but unlimited.
---
Enemy target frame? You can already target your enemy and "show target of target" is an option in vanilla?
---
I feel like a hunter with a spider pet could cause some problems for a Druid.
---
This and guild banks are the big ones IMHO
---
So if there are things in your life that you are not happy about, you just accept it and wont do anything to change things in your favour?
---
Trust me im all for positivity but endless shilling for a shitty greedy company is not for me. If we havent been complaining, we would be playing the game in the state it was during the demo come august.
---
Shapeshift clears roots too so not really.
---
Change request $$
---
Sorry, I wasn’t clear, I meant area loot. Yeah I’m beta it’s just under interface options and it OK, but area loot is a QoL change I personally wouldn’t mind but still get why I need to run over to everything I kill
---
Indeed it is, was hoping someone would save it or something and then get spellpower gear and then test it. If it goes above the max damage specified then it would be affected by spell damage, only one shot tho.
---
You can technically still run Lua code in macros in classic with /run. But the functions you are probably used to using like CastSpellByName and RunMacro and TargetUnit are all protected.
---
So in practice, you can't really do any of the if condition stuff you are probably thinking. They made the functions protected to combat automation.
---
If you want to search your 1.12.1 macros and know exactly what is protected or not, you go here http://wowprogramming.com/docs/api.html and search the function name and it'll tell you if it's protected.
---
If you just like programming it, weakauras is an add-on that can maybe fill that void my showing icons or something on the conditions you create 🤷‍♂️
---
What I don't get about wanting language specific servers is that if I've understood it correctly, it's mostly Italian/German/Spanish/french(?) Servers were talking about. And if I'm not mistaken all those countries teach English as a second language? 
---
I'm against language specific servers I'd rather see a larger community were people speak with people from other countries instead of hugging together to their countrymen. If you want more language specific create a German only guild, but you will still be a part of the larger community meanwhile having a "comfort zone" of the guild. I know it's unpopular opinion but I think language specific servers are ridiculous
---
I read that as international cooldown and was momentarily befuddled.
---
I hope it's something like 30 minutes.
---
I'm so glad you wrote this because the people that didn't play Vanilla needed to hear it.  I was on a medium population server, and by the time TBC was released, less than 10 guilds on my faction were farming Molten Core.  Only 4 were farming BWL.  If I'm remembering correctly, there were less than 5 guilds on the opposite faction farming molten core. That's how hard it was to get into a good raiding guild back in Vanilla.  It takes a lot to consistently get 40 people online at the same time multiple nights a week... but when you do, its the most fun you'll ever have gaming.
---
Wish more people on this sub (Reddit and the internet in general really) could think of opinions like that. Experiences don't have to be so black or white. We're allowed to disagree without either person being an idiot!
---
Okay, good luck
---
There are plently of good 2H weapons to allow you to make it to whirlwind axe. Maybe not at level 30, but by level 37-38 with some resist potions you can prob solo him.
---
Some examples:  
---
level 3 - large axe from vendor  
---
level 10 - warrior quest (I know this a 1h, but its kind of necessary at this point in the game)  
---
level  14 (more like 16-17) serena bloodfeather quest in the barrens   
---
level 14-17ish - WC staff quest - dont disregard staves they are amazing  
---
level 25 - akira quest in 1k needles  
---
level 31 - venture coming mining quest in STV
---
you now get whirlwind axe at some point between now and 46  
---
level 46 - weapons of spirit in feralas  
---
level 50 - the might u'cha in ungoro crater  
---
This does not even cover the drops you can get from running instances - RFK, BFD, mauradon, etc.
---
Dota is a super fun game but getting into the game can be very demoralizing at first. I highly suggest you focus on a few heroes first then start expanding hero pool after that. Even after 4K hours on dota 2 I still learn something new
---
\&gt;not booking both
---
*laughs in special treatment*
---
area loot is 1000000% not needed in vanilla. fuck all that noise. just my opinion
---
Are they BiS? For the whole "expansion"?
---
Exposing bugs in a beta testing?? BAN THE HERETIC
---
You're a dumbass.
---
It was in before tbc wtf, the AQ event?
---
Ofcourse not. He asked why retail xpacs always had a smooth launch and i answered him. Layering is simular but not the same technology.
---
I don't like this at all. From the sounds of it this could really hamper forming groups if you have a quildmates/friends teaming up for a quest and then joining another group to do a different quest if each group is in a different layer.
---
The only time I found myself swapping weapons while leveling was to a shield/1h in key situations like knowing I'm killing a caster mob and charge -&gt; interupt then swap to 2h to reduce damage taken. Losing the auto attack damage to increase your overpower damage a good bit isn't really worth it and if it is, it's honestly not worth the headache. But early on leveling a new weapon skill pre-40 takes really no time at all.
---
At least it releases towards the end of summer
---
Heroic strike takes your base weapon swing and adds damage. That bonus damage does not change at all based on weapon speed. Your damage per rage spent is the same regardless of your weapon speed. This is unlike abilities like mortal strike, which scales directly with damage range. The higher the range (i.e. the slower the weapon), the more damage per rage you get.
---
Weapon speed while leveling, and especially at 10, does not matter at all. You take the sword because it's already leveled up.
---
You're talking to a purist throwing catch phrases around, nevermind that.
---
Dont forget Princess in Elwynn Forest!!
---
A few years back I was in a bar after going to see a Third Eye Blind show. My buddy went to the bathroom, so I sat at the bar and finished my beer, when this guy walked up and started talking to me. Just friendly banter while he waited to get the bartenders attention, it came up that we were at the show and he asked how it was - I told him I loved it - Third Eye Blind has been my favorite band since I was in high school, love the music, and I listen to it all the time still. The guy told me he was glad to hear it, and noticing my beer glass was empty, offered to buy me another. I accepted and we chatted about a few other random things. 
---
I'm ashamed to admit that when my buddy returned, he immediately exclaimed "Yo! You're Stephan Jenkins!", it was pretty cool - he was a normal guy just grabbing a few drinks, and he felt really personable. He asked me when I first started listening, and I told him it was in in 1998, right after The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
---
Thanks for chiming in.
---
Lol it's not difficult at all. You can't click something you've already looted. It just takes longer. That's literally the only difference.
---
Urgh.. Tips..
---
Pillars of Eternity, I've not played them and loved the old baldurs gate
---
Gets mind controlled and thrown off again by no-lifer camper.
---
Pretty sure I faction changed in wotlk
---
World PvP needed better rewards to curtail the battlegrounds. At the very least more honor for kills.
---
That’s cool, I can understand. It’s not needed, but it’s a quality of life change I personally wouldn’t mind, which is the whole point of the thread.
---
Lol it's so pathetic you have to keep insinuating things to make yourself feel better. I'm 5 foot? Lol. high loans? lol hopefully you're trolling that would be funny. You don't work at Blizzard, at least in any meaningful capacity, and everything you say is BS. The player retention of classic wow will have nothing to do with what day it's released on. Haha
---
Thats not how the world works though. You might not even know you are missing something in your relationship and then someone comes along and before you know it you are infatuated. But you still love your partner and dont know what to do about it. So you wait and see. Maybe time will tell you whats right for you. End the relationship and its over before you know if the new thing is something you need or if its just interesting since its new. Its not as black and white as you think.
---
&gt;There aren't many good, easily attainable 2H weapons between the quest rewards from Deadmines/Wailing Caverns  
---
I would recommend looking at SM GY and BFD especially for horde.  
---
Never level in PVE spec on a PVP server.  That is the general one spec fits all scenario for any contested zone.  Go full arms and get mortal strike first if you are likely to play on a PVP server.
---
This has already been solved without layering FYI.
---
You have servers Arthas 1, Arthas 2, and so on, all of which share guild name and character pools and are eligible for merging later on.
---
You add servers based on population and have a "suggested server" for players based on what they are looking for.
---
As far as crashing economies... You really can't compare a server merge to the economic effect of multiple layers of thousands of people sharing an AH and layer hopping to exploit.
---
What on earth...   I'm outty lol.
---
Shoulda been an azerite sliver instead of 500. Or maybe some rep despite being exalted and there aren’t paragon boxes yet.
---
* Spell damag/crit/hit in character screen (everyone will just use addon anyway)
---
* Auto dismount (everyone will just use addon anyway)
---
* Auto down rank buffs (everyone will just use addon anyway)
---
* Enemy castbars (everyone will just use addon anyway)
---
Red that in the french voice from spongebob
---
The thing is that the Blizzard of old are no more, that is the direction of the firm, extreme left, every voice matters, you want this we will give it to you, genders are equal and all that.
---
We can see this not just from retail wow, but from Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm and Diablo. All four of these games, ruined. I dont think they can manufacture the same experience that made people love Blizzard games.
---
The company is not just an entertainment company anymore, but can be seen as a tool for the US and the left wing side, that is coming from the head of Activision Blizzard and no lead designer this or that can change this no matter how much they tried.
---
Players will be evenly distributed across the layers upon logging in, so in your scenario it will be roughly 2,300 on each layer.  It won't really ever become lopsided like that barring some extreme circumstance.
---
Private servers owners will not peep a squeak if they know what's good for them after Classic releases. Blizzard may not give a shit if you run pirate versions of expansions long past, but when you present direct challenge to their profits to a product they are currently supporting, you gonna get fucked.
---
Sorry duder, I'm not wasting a bunch of time doing Uldaman trash to gear out a toon thats being destroyed in 2 months. I do have a gimmiky think i'm testing with the Torch of Retribution.. so I will be online (pve server alliance) tonight Shaemus in game.
---
You will when a full t1 hunter that spent 0 dkp uses his dkp to take your core hound tooth or band of accuria while you paid for ur tier pieces with dkp, like you really have to argue about it?
---
The only problem with mara runs in real classic, is that you would have to invite someone every time you wanted to leave, or use a hearthstone to the nearest town, which makes it a lot harder to just speed run it several times.
---
I recommend getting mining/herbalism instead and killing the earth elemental packs inside and take your time getting everything (Including killing the bosses.) Which should take about 45 minutes, resulting in decent gold. (15 minutes to run back, 45 minutes for the instance, loop it with your hearthstone.)
---
You can do this with pre-raid BiS gear, or less depending on how good you are, and your pet.
---
Look it up before assuming you are correct. The numbers for strength scales way worse then spirit. Or are you convinced that 1 strength =2 AP = good
---
You're a native english speaker? I mean if you're speaking your own language you couldn't understand. Why should I give up my whole language to play a game with so many elements I've learned in another language? Should we all give up our native language and embrace english? Even though it has its flaws? Sure I've learned english, doesn't mean I'm giving up on my three other languages, including my two mother tongues. If I want to, I could just not make the effort to speak english on an english speaking server and that's it, but then I'll be playing with french people making up a small portion of it, and that would suck. I'd rather play where I know most french-speaking people go, and speak both, according to the situation, than giving up my language.
---
Was with you until you started talking about them balancing classes in Classic and stuff. I wouldn’t mind seeing them go in a different direction but if we’re doing Classic I’m going to want to play BC after and not a spin off. Honestly I don’t really care what they do after as long as they preserve Classic and give me the option to keep my character on a only Classic realm. I would have gotten the main thing I wanted which is Classic WoW as close to it’s original state as possible.
---
I have u on my friends list from a group quest last week!
---
I been raiding vanilla for years...
---
Your predictable failure does not bother me at all.  I find it comical.
---
You are failing to grasp the hardest part of raiding in vanilla... maintaining a 40 man roster.
---
You clearly have not been reading the bullshit, repeated posts on this sub
---
If you actually think that they would have a beta and multiple stress tests for no reason, just to release the exact same version of the game as the demo, then you have no critical thinking skills and it’s pointless to try and reason with you.
---
And in 2019 we know how to take a photo with our phone and upload that
---
Show target of target is an option in classic?  Maybe I didn’t look deep enough for it during the stress test.
---
 No sitting will not activate abilities that activate as the result of a crit. You just get crit!
---
&gt;At a minimum blizz could suggest servers based on language. 
---
&gt; I made the mistake of rolling on Blackrock in vanilla... because it just so happened to be an unofficial Australian server.
---
And it was the unofficial AUS PvP server because many aussies were suggested to roll there by Blizzard, based on the location of their IP address.
---
I think the long and the short of it are that suggested language realms would be great, so long as everyone *knows* why they're being suggested to roll there.
---
Hunter and warlock are my two considerations right now. I'll be leveling with a group of friends and what I love about Vanilla is the journey to 60 and all the wPvP that comes with it. That brings me to my three questions.
---
1. Is it bad being a warlock as alliance since a lot of horde players will be undead with "will of the forsaken" to dispel fear?
---
2. If I chose to go hunter should I go dwarf or night elf? I can see Shadowmeld having its moments with a stealth pet but Stoneform seems nice vs rogues and warriors aswell.
---
3. I plan to go herbalism + skinning, but how I would love to keep "track humanoids" on most of the time for world PvP. Is there a smart way to toggle between "find herbs" and track humanoids?
---
I am no authority on retail WoW. I stopped playing somewhere around Wrath and played since Vanilla Beta..
---
I did watch some streams of BFA and what I noticed a lot of is that you interact with big name characters far too often, your character also seems more like a Superhero. Am I wrong here? Because I despise those aspects and that seemed to be the case.
---
In Vanilla you mostly just felt like a cog in the machine. Much more appropriate to me.
---
Do you have a citation for this? 
---
I sadly didn’t tank a whole lot in vanilla (war only got to 44) until I rolled a new warrior during BC. Forgive me if I’m wrong—but even during vanilla if your total avoidance (miss, dodge, parry, block) summed to 100%, don’t you push Crits off the table in addition to Crushing blows? 
---
Because of how crits, crushing blows, and normal attacks are separate on the attack table, once you exceed 100% with your avoidance, all three are pushed off
---
Just 3?
---
Awesome thanks for advice!
---
&gt;What’s blizzard most likely to respond to: 
---
&gt;“guys, I think layering isn’t so great. People may not like it and there are negative consequences to it being in the game. You should maybe fix it before release.” 
---
&gt;“I’M DONE. Taking my money elsewhere. Game is dead and it’s all because of layering.” 
---
The first one. No one should listen to the emotional outbursts of adult children.
---
They said they were testing a few different ideas on the stress test a while back. This was probably one of them that got overlooked.
---
This was a big deal for Australians.
---
We didn't actually get AUSTRALIAN HOSTED servers until MoP IIRC.
---
So we always had 200-300ms even if it was an "Oceanic" server.
---
Unless they pull a Blizzard and not have any Aussie servers for classic for some reason it isn't needed AFAIK.
---
Unless there's some other poor region that went through exactly what we did and still have to put up with 200+ MS. But AFAIK, every place in the world has servers close enough to be at minimum 100-150.
---
Sorry bud, didn't realize this was posted here.  Found it and thought it was neat.  :/
---
&gt; Probably it will be a 2 minutes CD. Short enough not to affect grouping, but long enough to discourage resource exploit.
---
I'd happily rotate ever 2 minutes for those sweet black lotus farm spots.
---
Yes! This is what it said, what does that mean? Sorry like I said I'm wow noob. Your 2h skills level up separately from total level?
---
No need for name calling.
---
I simply enjoy blacksmithing from a fantasy perspective. I know engineering is good, it's regarded as the best profession. Plenty of other people will have it, I'm sure. I'd rather buy that stuff than do engineering again.
---
It's all just a bunch of opinions based on personal preference. No wrong or right.
---
Being able to talk to npcs in animal forms as a druid. Although i get the RP reasons behind it so no big deal.
---
100% ..if you somehow itemize that much spirit while leveling enjoy taking longer to kills things and taking more damage since you'll be rocking cloth gear
---
I'm not native English, I'm swedish. I think it's dumb to create a language barrier between players because they to stubborn to speak a common language. And were should Blizzard draw the line? Should we get Bulgarian, Danish, Serbian servers as well?
---
The equation goes like this, Leveling speed = recovery time + combat time.  
---
Spirit is more valuable than strength or stamina, because it reduces your recovery time.  When you have low spirit, increasing spirit impacts your time to level more than increasing your damage by a small amount.  A weapon with higher top end will help to reduce your time in battle, armor with spirit will help reduce your recovery time.
---
If you take two weapons of the same DPS, the slower weapon *must* have a higher damage range. You said yourself "Heroic strike takes your base weapon swing..."  
---
That base weapon swing uses your weapon's damage range plus Attack Power to calculate it. In the example of Haggard's Mace, it's DPS is identical to the Sword *and* it's slower.
---
&gt; y'all talk like it's been decades.
---
Some people here have been participants in last few betas they did. This isn't unwarranted scepticism or malice, it's a reaction on Blizzard's recent track record in making Beta a blowjob of an AD provided for free by streamers while ignoring most of legitimate issues.
---
Important and nice video! GJ @Traquenuage
---
Yes, it is a project solely because of community, totally not for Blizzard. No way the company is going to make a few bags full of money from this! We did it reddit!
---
/u/Ww_Glamdring_wW you used the wrong funeral bomb video - [this one](https://youtu.be/MEpv7YxnLCQ) is the original.
---
Sounds like they made it a less seamless experience. It's now further from the original game. 1-20 zones idea that is going around seems like a no brainer.
---
This guy classics
---
Awesome yea if we find a guild it'll probably have a be a casual one anyway I can't commit too much to raid timings or anything. I've been looking around for some build guides either on YouTube or here but haven't had much luck, any suggestions?
---
Lol okay bud im trying to give very valid and proven methods of more efficient leveling, but keep living under your rock - good luck leveling
---
Yeah dude I know
---
and now 60 days feels like an eternity
---
Might as well make it so you can only change layers in rested areas. Triggering on XP is going to be very confusing and is essentially a less consistent version of just using Inns.
---
You never played Vanilla.
---
Trust me when I say this, QoL when it comes to looting is 1 corpse at a time in Vanilla. Even the auto-loot debate is a bit much because you have to remember bag space is a literal premium in Vanilla.
---
You will start out auto looting until you realize you just fucked up and now must not auto loot anything and only pick and choose what you think is most valuable to loot from corpses.
---
Area loot would be a huge downgrade to QoL in Vanilla. You'd spend more time deleting items than you would save looting since deleting requires accepting the delete every time.
---
Cool, If you want to derp around in Searing Gorge doing a level 50 quest line. hmu!

Skarm just made [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSzLn3iRK-g) discussing the difference as being an OT vs a MT.
---
Hey thanks! Awesome sounds perfect yea I'll definitely keep and in kind and level as enh
---
and no mount once inside the raid either
---
You mean roll a Warrior alt? Warrior doesn't really appeal to me. I would be doing it for the tanking and not for the class, and I feel like I need to be at least somewhat connected to the class.
---
I mean I see plenty of video evidence of what I said and nothing about full spirit warrior leveling. There's some opportunity for you there to showcase man! Enjoy the exposure showing off the new efficient way to level a warrior!
---
Oh i do follow that guy. Thaaanks
---
Support. Agamaggan was not a fun time.

I remember a corpse retrieval in the Plane of Fear taking *hours*.

AoE looting would make farming more efficient and would reduce the loot time alot when AoE farming
---
This would be a very bad thing to add to classic
---
Thats what i'm saying.  Lay the hammer right, she won't get antsy for those devilish rogues
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVVzmLxom is much more damage than that build leading up to 38. Every single talent point is +damage besides piercing howl which is an amazing ability. /sit enrage proccing is a thing on classic it just requires the correct timing by sitting and standing up within the same spell batch when being attacked by a mob
---
Every NPC in retail refers to you as “Champion” or “Hero”. 
---
In vanilla, it’s like you’re a spec of sand on the beach.
---
Yeah, that’s still a pretty tough matchup. Stun resist and fears kill
---
Why do you hate flying so much? As a PVEr it made life so much easier when it was released back in TBC. Its not like you ever saw anyone on the roads back in Vanilla outside of a few lower levels. Most level 60s idled by the cart in IF between farming Tyrs hand and raiding.
---
There are 2 months left until the cards are DEALT.
---
Your "we have to work with the cards we are dealt" is premature and obviously a r/classicwow moderator attempt at minimize the issue...because it's not an NA issue as well. As I said, cards are not dealt yet.
---
When was the "we have to work with the cards we are dealt"  when Loot Trading was initially announced? Or the 4 Phase content? Or the sharding? 
---
Oh...it wasn't because IT WAS ALSO an NA issue. I got it.
---
So, maybe, just maybe, try to understand that this issue is a MASSIVE one for the EU, and like it or not, when the SHITSTORM will start in the EU Classic WoW because "international" bullshit realms, will impact Classic image OVERALL...yeah, you guessed, it will impact NA as well.
---
Don't try to put a lid on this because NA is not affected. And don't white knighting for Blizzard, telling us that "we have to work with the cards we are dealt" when CLEARLY it wasn't the same case with other Classic issues.
---
Yeah but that's not really reliable unless you're in a farm raid. Very few guilds go through AQ40 or Naxx without people dying.
---
Tldr: WE don't. As a french who Plays every games in english i'm fine with their decision. You must be a new player if you don't use english while playing. 
---
Every raid and dungeon we use english name. Hfc ? Brf? Votw ? Etc etc.
---
90% of theorycraft and weak auras are in english.
---
Better than running into a semi shallow pond and drowning or getting stuck at the side of a fire and getting roasted to death.
---
When did I say go full spirit? Clearly you have no logic nor can you read either. I said don’t go full strength because having split spirit and strength benefits you more than maxing just strength
---
The spikes are for you... or your corpses rather.
---
Addons can hide bars. I did this all the time to hide no-cooldown spammable BS so long as I had range indicators for same school elsewhere.
---
that just solves the first 2
---
&gt; As far as crashing economies... You really can't compare a server merge to the economic effect of multiple layers of thousands of people sharing an AH and layer hopping to exploit. 
---
I mean, we've seen how damaging merging server economies has been. It's going to be far worse than the minimal impact layer exploits will have. Resources are time gated, you're not going to see a massive influx.
---
Kevin Jordan talked about how they had him make 50 different layouts. Caverns of Time, Grim Batol, Ghostlands where all made before Vanilla was made
---
Similar to the Karazahn runs in early TBC.
---
any news on that talent build?
---
What part of heroic strike doesn't scale with weapon speed is that hard to understand? You pay 15 rage for a flat damage increase. At level 1, you're paying 15 rage for 11 damage. You could have a 0.5 speed weapon, or you could have a 10.0 speed weapon. In either case you're paying 15 rage for the exact same amount of damage.
---
Not just 3, a whole 3.
---
Hamstring kite still works. The mob may get an extra hit in which isn't ideal, but it's still way better than not kiting.
---
The biggest ones already said they are shutting down when classic releases. Nice strawman though.
---
&gt; The Russians also don't like the situation, the guys I have seen so far said, that the Russian community isn't that big, so they could potentially be stuck on empty servers.
---
And yet, theres maybe 1 russian dude per non-russian guild on english based servers.
---
Based on my past year on a pirate server, I'd be entirely willing to confine russian playerbase to their own server. Russians who moan about being stuck on their national servers are not doing it for some multiculturalist experience, it's to have other people to mooch off of.
---
Reserve people dont look for groups, they make them, that's how it works.
---
I'd say max settings at 1080p is better than. 1440p at high settings (which may be what happens in raids). So I mean, it is up to you. I think 1080p looks great in Classic and I am not convinced that the higher resolution is super necessary, but that's personal opinion.
---
Apparently players have been demanding that pandaren be a playable race since vanilla
---
Either way, it's still interesting information.
---
I also just want the old server forums so I can follow the "I stole the cookies" posts
---
&gt; You realise that they're not gonna create 3x realms for each language right? 
---
Nobody asked for that. We asked for the German, French, Spanish and Italian, because of player ratio of those languages.
---
Nobody asked for Romanian realms. Or Polish, or Bulgarian, or Danish, or Swedish , or etc. etc. realms.
---
Get your "facts" straight.
---
Nice box set my brother
---
I watched the video but I'm still a bit confused.  
---
Basically you're (or the video is) saying Scatter/Freezing Trap shared a DR in Vanilla, and it does currently Classic. However, it didn't on private servers, and people in general thought it worked better that way and want it to be like that in Classic.  
---
Is that right?
---
You can use it cooldown-free, right?
---
Depends if Peter Jackson releases a hit film with cows and zombies, or a film with dwarves, elves and humans.  Might sway people one way or another like '04
---
Is it really worth playing kh3 before remind? Didn't they say they were adding new cutscenes ans playable Roxas during the story anyways?
---
&gt;A. Blizzard says this is to allow for more freedom to pick a server.
---
Blizzard kinda forgot how it isn't any of their business telling us how to have fun or play the game in Vanilla. So their "incentive" of forbidding national servers can fuck right off.
---
This is too true. Games just release aggressively fast now and you pay to test it. Then a year later everyone's like "Nah man this game is great now they fixed all the problems" but too often you paid for a shit game and got turned off from it so much that you don't even want to bother trying it again.
---
Or you could just run BFD RFK more than once.... Its "slower" but what's slowest is repeatedly dying, being underleveled for your quests, and killing things slow. One or two extra dungeons might increase your total time to 60 by 30min or an hour at most if you can make a group efficiently(not a problem as a tank).
---
&gt; You can't click something you've already looted
---
In vanilla you could.

I am a severe case but I would have never put instances in wow if I was a dev (no raids, dungeons or bgs). The game would be all open world with the main game being world pvp and fighting over world bosses for drops and loot.
---
Doing the WoW Ironman challenge in retail. Fun stuff!
---
That seems like forever when you put it that way.
---
lmao, thats incredibly unfortunate man. By RL best friend's wife was on Morena, (the ued thing) but she got knocked up because she did yoga and it got dislodged a bit. Had these crazy cramps for a few weeks, got knocked up, and then they finnally went to get her looked at.. to late. 
---
Happy accidents tho!
---
Wickerman?
---
How many times can a Druid shapeshift while getting viper stung?
---
Like I’m just trying to imagine the battle in my head.
---
I said "unless you like the support roll" as a condition. Generally newer players like to see their efforts have immediate tangible impact and dealing damage(infinitely easier than managing healing) + killing mobs + loot is a more straightforward path to that reward.
---
It's less so "having the clearly defined role" (nothing wrong with healing) and a bit more the pragmatic approach you observably took towards recommending her a class, you didnt give it much thought to her being the DPS side of the duo and immediately shoehorned her in to a support role as its better fitting of the players of her "type" eg casual/rarely games, NE / Human zones appealing to tastes, and wife. If there was no gender / social title i find it hard to believe you might not have suggested such a linear composition
---
Also realistically the priest is fairly shallow in respect of fantasy aspects for class design. Unless your thing is hyper-religion is not very *fantasy*
---
Does gamebreaking mean something different nowadays?
---
Yes but it breaks when you take damage.
---
I'm in the same case and still don't agree with you... I've been playing since BC, I've always played on french servers, and if some abreviations are used, I'm still not feeling like playing in english only for items and all locations... My add-ons are in english, yeah, but I speak on the /2 and /world in french, and be it official or not, french people who don't speak english will converge to one server and I'll be there cause it's just more comfortable. You don't wanna spend all your time talking in another language...
---
Well, other than mop and wod, every other exp zones were in one of the Alpha maps of classic. So would be fun to see what they could make with it if they didnt rush out wow back then
---
There is warcraft chronicles which are 3 books lavishly made.
---
i gotta be honest this is a garbage gift
---
you framed cd covers and cds
---
why not just frame some warcraft artwork instead
---
Offtanking in any context generally refers to throwing on some tank gear and holding aggro for the duration of the fight.
---
The requirements for when off-tanks are needed vary greatly, and whether you will be asked to off-tank depends on the options available.
---
Out in the world or in instances, crowd control is often more viable, kiting might be another option, or having a hunter/lock pet offtank is a third. In raids there's usually several viable offtanks including dps specced warriors or other ferals. 
---
If you're interested in picking up the role of a potential off-tank, you'll need to collect tanking gear that makes you viable for the encounter, and have it available in your bag for when the time comes. You'll want to look at what main-tanks aspire to, and consider some lower effort alternatives. In addition if any tank gear comes up for roll and isn't needed by anyone, make sure you put your hand up.
---
Feral druids make great tanks either in the main or offtank role, and any druid worth their salt should have a tank set ready to go.
---
For me the raiding wasn't as bad as the PVP hole.
---
At least raiding had scheduled times.
---
Pvp WSG premades or sometimes AV premade were 24/7.
---
I did a lot of hours but I capped out at General and was happy about it.  I did great and helped many HW's reach their ranks.  But I was playing half as much as they were.
---
When my best friend decided he wanted to push for HW...  He hit rank 13 and then was just so burned out (we had been doing runs for other HW's for months) he got mad at his premade group and basically got himself blacklisted a week before he would have been HW.  He tried to do it on his own and it just wasn't possible.
---
All those oldschool HW's will tell you it was their team that got them HW (in addition to their own nolifing).  Round the clock 100%winrate WSGs put your rank out ahead of anyone else.
---
Damn I was glad I never had the desire to get HW.  Peaking at General with that insane amount of hours I was already doing was plenty. 
---
GL to any who wish to hit rank 14.  My biggest tip is give your team a lot of love, you can't do it solo I PROMISE.
---
@traquenuage
---
I have watched a lot of hunter pvp videos from you and greatwizard. I found the demonstration of skill in some of these videos to be quite high. However, I remember thinking to myself that hunters weren't that strong. The scattershot into full duration freezing traps seemed totally off. It seemed kinda op. Hunters in Vanilla had a lot of crippling mechanics which limited them in PvP. I do see your perspective however. The reality is that hunterd were not as strong in Vanilla as what many private servers show. Just like how warriors were stronger in Vanilla than on private servers.
---
&gt;wife, kids, mortgage 
---
You’re taking like these are all problems that can’t be solved
---
Shorter Flight paths, and summon stones. I like how the game is slower but, at the same time damn dude can I get where I am going in under 50 minutes. Also a faster way for the horde to access Black rock stuff. Ridiculous how long they make it take.
---
Imo it goes in both directions. In Vanilla Shattered Hand became an unofficial Swedish speaking server. So I left it, because I didn't want to play with only Swedes. And I definitely didn't want to speak Swedish in an otherwise English speaking world, i.e. the game itself.
---
Sharding is a feature in the new game no matter how little you like it. Layering is a temporary solution that the lead dev said IS NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF CLASSIC. Stop being so obtuse.
---
Final fantasy XII on my Switch 👍
---
Simple: What if you pick a server, all swedish that you are, and realize at lvl 20 that that's the server that german people (20% of EU player base) chose to establish their unofficial server? Simple as that. 
---
Plan is simple: Give a server to DE and FR speaking, being large communities, and minorities that are already used to english because of being a small community will know where to go to have english, and not FR or DE, which would be a pain for them.
---
Don't you think?
---
orc clans are the coolest.
---
Hi, yes the spells shared DR in Vanilla, however it was most likely unintentional as DR is supposed to share only with same schools of CCs. Freezing Trap and Scatter Shot are different type of CC's.
---
So it's basically a bug from original Vanilla, I personally think it should be fixed because it is really bad for the hunter's kit (as bad as melee leeway if you need a comparison).
---
Well I played since about month 2 of vanilla through legion, and all of vanilla as a hunter who only had 4 bags cause of arrow supply, and I still would prefer not to have to chase down all my corpses. It’s a personal preference, I completely get why someone else wouldn’t want it, I’m listing it as something I personally would want.
---
Yep, I always use Spotify. Easier to control while driving and it saves where I'm at.
---
Should and do are two different things.  I’d argue that doomsday news stories, YouTube content that includes “YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT...” in the title, and clickbait articles wouldn’t be so prominent if they didn’t work. Extremes sell.
---
Do you work at Blizzard or how do you know that the EU will get exactly those 5 realms?
---
yeah, i mean im gona try to go fast, but i totally understand people wanna enjoy the ride by itself :)
---
Honestly, I was a huge /nochanges guy at first, but now I think that we could probably use some lite QoL features.  Basically make a better version of vanilla that is still very faithful.  Mostly things that addons can already do should be added in.  The multi-item mailing feature is in, that is fine.  I think that guild banks would probably be fine too, I don't know how they would implement that in classic, as they used new textures/geometry in the cities when they introduced that, but it is something already accomplished by alts, and is cumbersome.  Another nice thing might be the reagent bank?? (or a smaller version of such) I think having mounts as items in bags is ok, nobody is going to have enough mounts for that to matter much.   I think the QoL should be done with a light touch, because I think the overabundance of QoL changes made the game change a lot over time.  I think most of the confirmed QoL changes so far are o.k.  I think anything that effects the difficulty of the game probably shouldn't go in.  I think AoE looting would be fine, it doesn't change much, aoe farming would still probably be reliant on respawns, and not on the looting aspect as the time limiter.
---
Do you think i can have a healer set and a tank set? Like healing during the boss fight and tanking trash mobs until then?
---
meh. at least you see multiple genders on Alliance.  Only thing that is rare is Dwarf women and gnome dudes. 
---
I was literally the ONLY female troll at 60 on AKama for a year. We had 0 Female orcs, 1 Female Tauren (druid), every other caster was UD, all of our warriors where Orc males. we had 2 male trolls in guild, 1 hunter 1 Rogue.
---
I'm not sure you understand how weapon damage on your paper doll is calculated. :P   
---
I'm also not saying that speed *directly* affects Heroic Strike damage, but if you take two weapons of the same DPS and different speed factors, the slower weapon ***will*** Heroic Strike harder because it takes your paper doll damage and adds a bonus(in your repeated example, 11 damage).  
---
Example: Tomahawk VS Gladius. Both are 3.8 DPS, but because the Gladius is a slower swing speed my damage range is higher with it.   
---
With Tomahawk equipped my "Weapon Damage" portion of Heroic Strike is 62-69. When I equip the Gladius it becomes 77-85. By the very nature of a higher number listed in that Damage Range the Base Damage output of my Heroic Strike will go up by a corresponding amount.
---
Cool I'm pretty sure many other people on this sub have been playing vanilla for a while too, you're nothing special.
---
Do you think a guild that accepts any spec will have more issues filling a raid than one that looks for the most optimal composition? Lol please stop talking.
---
AV will generally be between 20 minutes to an hour long. On the occasion it might end up as a 2-3 hour slug match, but probably no more than that.
---
If you want longer AVs you have to honestly ask yourself why you want that. Consider in your answer that you used to be able to fully AFK in BGs for hours without being removed, an for your 40 hours of effort you still only walked away with 3 marks.
---
I know it was cool to join a BG before school, come home and rejoin the same one, but honestly after a few 2-3 hour games you'll be grateful that they're as they are.
---
The black whelps in redridge mountains dont drop a rare pet, the pets drop from badlands, wetlands and swamp of sorrows.
---
My thoughts exactly.  In terms of UI stuff that are "required addons" for most players, why not have it in the game anyway?
---
How about you guys stop being so fucking stubborn and speak a language whom more or less everyone in Europe has in common. Your problem is onto created because you refuse to speak English. So how about we all just play together and stop trying to hug up in small community's here and there. If you wanna feel at home with your language how about you create a french only guild where you can speak as much french as you want.
---
&gt;  the slower weapon will Heroic Strike harder because it takes your paper doll damage and adds a bonus(in your repeated example, 11 damage).
---
NO ONE'S SAYING THAT IT WON'T. IT OBVIOUSLY WILL HIT HARDER, BECAUSE IT'S TAKING YOUR BASE WEAPON. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT MAKES HEROIC STRIKING WITH A SLOWER WEAPON BETTER.
---
So you want something from Vanilla to be changed for Classic to make hunters stronger?
---
I guess my question to you would be, Does it matter? If there isn't any legit spellvamp in the game beyond this item the topic is sort of irrelevant.
---
I don't know, but it's a solid estimate. If ~21% of the population isn't getting their own realm, then it's a good assumption that the whole population isn't getting more than 5. Plus, Blizzard said EU would only be getting "several" realms.
---
Stop repeating stupid things.
---
Where were you with your  "We have to work with the cards we are dealt" when Loot Trading was announced? Or the 4 Phases content? Or sharding?
---
Is this sub an AMERICAN ONLY sub, where if there is not an NA issue...isn't an issue AT ALL?
---
Because it if is, just say it : "Europeans just can go fuck themselves, this sub is NA only and only NA issues are discussed here".
---
Its also apparent that he has been testing this by his Twitter post, and said he will continue to do
---
so. 
---
But 90% of the people commenting probably don't even open the link.
---
Ele and resto will have different gear sets because +spell dmg and +healing are two different stats. Yes, you *can* use some pieces for both specs, but the resto gear is useless for ele and ele gear is very underpowered for resto. So that flexibility won't really be available to you.
---
That said, with limited playtime Shaman is still a good class to pick; they are always in high demand in raids and 5-mans so you shouldn't have any trouble getting a group or finding a raid slot to pick up your gear.
---
Night Elves never had black hair. Not in vanilla, not in retail.
---
Great input
---
Wow now it makes sense why Hunters are so freaking OP on private servers...
---
My GM, another officer, and I were in discord watching the stream together. We LITERALLY cried (sobbing actually) when it was announced.
---
"Le'ts talk about.....ice cream..."
---
Me: GM!!! IT'S VANILLA!!!! IT'S VANILLA!!!
---
GM: That would be too good to be tr----
---
Blizz: we like vanilla!
---
Alll 3 of us: \*\*hysterical screaming and crying\*\*
---
That's called the ret pally rotation.
---
really your best bet is to probably play casually, which will be find for P1 and maybe even P2 but will start to suck later on id imagine (not being able to raid when people are decked out in BWL+ is gonna make it haaaard to PvP or find dungeons).
---
I may have to go casual, but what I’m gonna do is probably level multiple alts for fun or even make a twink to pvp with. Probably a later leveled twink (39 seems fun, or even 49) so class identity comes into play and the well geared opponents can pose a threat. But yeah, having a busy life makes playing WoW hard, and as much fun it is reminiscing about being able to play whenever I wanted I enjoy the responsibilities I have now.
---
Neither one is better than the other? True except one has been out for a day and already failing and hype for the other is eclipsing retail.
---
Absolutely, looking in an old account's bank and reminiscing about things you chose to keep is a mark of the history of your character that's subtly diminished by the convenience of listifying these things.
---
Whoops I meant 6 slots
---
Sorry, but this is a 1.12 version of the game.  If there was a 1.13 version then mages and warriors could have been toned back, and hunter's could get separate DR for disorient and freeze?
---
Hi, first of all thanks !
---
Yes hunters were weaker in Vanilla due to this bug and the reality between Pserver and the Beta currently shows that. From what I could test on the beta, this makes hunter insanely weak and you can't rely anymore on cc's as you think you'd be able to.
---
In my opinion keeping those DR separate would allow hunter to still be a good pvp class because right now, it's not looking good.
---
They're talking about the corpse run
---
I just want my TCG Ogre Suit be be useable, lol
---
I'm assuming you never played wc3 or frozen throne. Pick it up and play through the campaign you'll be all caught up.  The lore in wc 1-2 isn't as fleshed out and character driven as 3 but it still exists in some form.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Because he wants to play enhance, thats the whole point, initially i was talking about if your going to enhance raid the improved wind fury totem would be better to have than not, if someone wants to raid enhance and can off heal as well as provide buffs fuck it ill let him in.
---
its not always about efficiency but letting people have a good time as well. 
---
I would be pumped to clear content with an enhance shaman in the guild, getting stuck on arguing about efficiency detracts from the fun in my opinion and I don’t mind letting players play what they want if their competent and not the sole reason for not stopping progression.
---
What makes no sense is that I have had to reiterate that I know its not efficient but possible to clear content , the why not is because that person wants to play enhance. 
---
I plan on main tanking and leading a casual raid guild come classic and had experience raiding in original vanilla and I see no reason to play this game at maximum efficiency personally and would rather have a fun guild that does shit like letting in an enhance on raid. Acting like it matters but that will be negligent in progression for a casual guild
---
&gt; A few days of uncoordinated chaotic fun vs months of layering? Shit I'd even pay extra for the former option.
---
You and me both. Let the Classic launch be the beautifully chaotic shit show it's going to be. The game will survive and we'll all have stories to tell about it years down the line. Which is the whole bloody *point.*
---
The number of people here who are both willing and happy to sacrifice that on the altar of expediency when that's exactly what led WoW to the state it's in now is absolutely baffling to me.
---
RIP, there goes that plan. Since anyone that chooses Alliance is permanently damaged
---
in the head.
---
Where did you go to get this done? Looks great!
---
So now we're back-pedaling from "Slower weapons don't affect the damage output of Heroic Strike" from above to "Hitting for more damage doesn't make it better."  
---
I'm glad to know we're making progress here. Hey man, if you want to use a weapon that hits for less on yellow attacks but generates the same rage per minute more power to you! I only made this post to try and help less-experience players, but you've clearly got everything figured out! ;)
---
Absolutely wish they would.
---
...Maybe take your own advice.
---
It's got the exact same drawbacks because it's basically the same system. Perhaps you just randomly read my comment without the prior comments for context, but the guy said it's only been a month and a half since classic beta went live as an excuse why these problems would just now be getting taken care of. My point is that the same type of system has been live and abused on the live servers for over a couple years now, so his point that it's only been a month and a half isn't a valid point at all when talking about layering.
---
I made no reference to saying it's going to be anything but at launch. I have no idea what you're even trying to argue about other than just seeing something that referenced people not wanting layering and feeling the need to jump in with some rage. v0v
---
Humans for +swords (and maces, hello MSA) if you have any PVE ambitions at all (which you do). Dwarves stoneskin is nice for PVP as is gnome's escape artist, but if you plan to PVE they definitely do not outweigh humans' weapon skills. Nelf is a joke because shadowmeld becomes largely redundant.
---
&gt; Assume a layer "cap" of 3000, that doesn't mean it goes to full then the next 5 players will be on a desolate layer with 5 players in the entire continent.   
---
&gt; That would be dumb and they will never implement it like that (both from a gameplay perspective and an economic one, spinning up a layer that can hold 3k just for 5 is a waste of money). 
---
no, because it would be 5 players plus everyone else logging in at the time.   
---
&gt; What is happening instead is that either there is a "yellow" status where population is say 2.500 and trending up and they start shuffling new logins to layer2 
---
so exactly what I wrote before which you said was dumb and something they would never do. 
---
&gt; **more likely** 
---
so which is it. do you know how it works or not?
---
&gt; when a layer reaches "capacity" they split it down the middle (preserving groups, guilds + friendlists as possible) and keep adding to both so population is more or less evenly spread out. 
---
well, splitting it down the middle would create exactly these immersion breaking situations you're speaking out against. 
---
&gt; We know that some layer hopping is happening without group invites from a bunch of streamer clips. 
---
yeah, but we also know it's not working as intended and that they're constantly working on improving the game.
---
We rolled those on a private server :p
---
Oh trust me bud, I'm not going anywhere :)
---
Why don’t you take a deep breath, remove your tinfoil hat, and reread what has been said.
---
Most of our moderation team is EU based, not NA, so you couldn’t be more mistaken. 
---
While we care about the issue, and hope it will be changed, we are not and will not sit idle for the next two months. Instead, we are creating a plan of action with the information we currently have. If Blizzard changes their mind, great - nothing of value lost. If not, then we will be prepared to move forward with the next best solution.
---
dumb guy idiot just 2hand kite with hamstring shieet
---
Hmmm, we don't need layers or shards at all. /s
---
I mean it's not hard to see why you think it should be changed if it makes the game more fun and balanced, but the argument about why it shouldn't has been repeated ad-nauseam for the past 6 months here. It seems extremely unlikely Blizzard would make an exception for this case.
---
alliance: dwarf
---
horde: undead for healing (magic dust instant cast etc), undead or male troll for shadow
---
This is completely false. Cities are layered and mobs are not the main reason for layering;  players are. Please refrain from making shit up and then posting said misinformation. It creates unnecessary confusion.
---
Any of the raids get real long if you die towards the end. I also remember hating the run to RFK/RFD in the Barrens, but maybe I'm thinking of the living run to the instance rather than the spirit run.
---
It's not the same system, that's why you're being obtuse. Clearly they serve two completely different functions so saying layering could result in the same experience as sharding is intentionally being intellectually dishonest just to have something to complain about.
---
Holy shit :p
---
Because they are worse than other classes at every role they can spec into in Vanilla, not saying they are terrible they are just not optimal if you enjoy playing them then just play one you probably won't have too much issues finding a guild as long as you are willing to go resto and healbot raids because you will not be dpsing I can tell you that much.
---
It's bait. And we fell for it.
---
I say go mage; once you have achieved your r14 dreams, the wpvp possibilities for mage are endless. Even r14 warriors are still dependent on having a pocket healer to truly wreck in PVP.
---
I usually put it on Charge and Heroic Strike.
---
Or Charge and Rend depending on my spec/level. (Sometimes Heroic Strike is better than Rend)
---
Basically I throw them on my two skills I open with.
---
Once I start PvPing I'll put it on Hamstring as well.
---
It shouldn’t impact that at all. Only specific events trigger the cooldown. There should be no legitimate reason you want to hop layers mid pvp or immediately after looting a chest
---
That’s basically my point.   
---
I’m saying that people are more likely to vote on extreme viewpoints.  Whereas you may downvote an extreme because it’s nonsensical, you may upvote an extreme that’s more in line with your thinking. Most people likely won’t upvote a middle ground statement even if it aligns with their viewpoint.
---
Nothing takes place during the story from what I've read.
---
The DLC is cut into 4 pieces of content, 1 free, 3 paid. 
---
* The free part is the keyblade and keyblade transformation for Oathkeeper. I guess this is being made free to placate people who are whining about how such an iconic weapon was going to be behind a paywall (admittedly Oathkeeper and Oblivion are iconic).
---
* One part is the "Additional Scenario". Once you beat Master Xehanort in the main campaign you'll get a new menu option to play the Additional Scenario that will have its own save file / progression associated with it. There is apparently some sort of character selection component in choosing who you want to play as, between Riku, Roxas, and Aqua (the best trio they could choose I imagine - one from each trio, and each representing a different archetype between Air, Earth, and Water). The footage we saw takes place during the Keyblade War. Beyond that, we don't know the scope of content here. 
---
* Another part is "Limit Cut". This is a new post-game dungeon for the main campaign. "At least" 13 boss encounters and comparable difficulty to "Data" encounters. This sounds like Caverns of Remembrance 2.0.  
---
* The last part is "Secret Episode". This includes "at least" one new "uber" boss and some story content associated with it for the main campaign. Nothing yet said about the process of unlocking the secret episode. 
---
There's no reason not to play now since you have to finish the main campaign to play the Additional Scenario and your progress will carry into Limit Cut and Secret Episode. 
---
Also, this is just speculation on my part, but *if the Secret Episode is gated by needing one of the "proof" key items*, it's probably a good idea to play now, since currently one of the proofs you have to either beat Critical and the other proof requires you to collect all 90 Mickey Emblems. That's either a tedious as fuck hunt for collectibles or beating Critical in its entirety, a bit chunk of time to spend either way.
---
I thought this was true as well but I can't find any proof, and if you run the dungeon on retail the area that looks like it should open up stays closed.
---
Gotta say though that Twin Emps run back was painful. We never got a chance to down them back in the day.
---
Yea but healer girl is PVE focused and dude plans to go for rank 14. Soooo not compatible there.
---
Here’s a simple charge macros
---
#showtooltip Charge /startattack /cast [stance:1]Charge;[stance:2]Battle Stance;[stance:3]Battle Stance 
---
Macros are great for warriors, this is but a simple macro to stance change to charge, there’s even a more advanced macro that will change which ability depending on the situation charge or intercept
---
Cave? Well look at mr suave.
---
I call it a boat hole
---
As a warlock you either sacrifice your succubus for damage or are on imp bitch duty. So for PvE undead.
---
Dear god please stay away from guide making if you can't understand such a basic concept of damage per rage.
---
wait......you're not /u/shittymorph.
---
Pretty sure anyone joining the group is brought onto the layer of the party leader.
---
Thanks for the reminder to camp alliance working on frostsabers rep. If we don't get a special mount, they don't either.
---
This also omits Revantusk Village and the Wildhammer Clan, which were originally their own factions for horde and alliance respectively but were scrapped and folded into generic faction alignment several patches after release.
---
I play a few games of overwatch a night and just downloaded a pserver to help narrow down which class to play (hunter, mage, or warrior)
---
Hunters were considered very situational in PvP, and ultimately quite vulnerable. I would watch some of your hunter montages and be like omgwaow!!!,l but then I'd slap myself across the face and be remember some moments were impossible in Vanilla.
---
I totally understand your gripe. Hunter gameplay in the private server scene is some of the most skillful and entertaining.
---
You are delusional.
---
UD is for intellectuals.
---
You tanked right?
---
This akes RESURECTION ability actualy important and usefull, change my mind.
---
SO wholesome =D
---
Really? Many of my characters have hit up Wetlands at around level 17/18 because there’s a lot of quests there and on PvP servers it serves as a nice respite when Redridge gets inundated with gankers. I usually see a lot of others running around when up there too.
---
IF it was in Vanilla it should stay, even if it was a bug.
---
Got a Tauren hunter to level 54 named Kimahri from FF10 cuz I made it look like him.. never found out about talent points till my next warrior character :)
---
Your data is WRONG...because it is based on RETAIL numbers.
---
Totally IRRELEVANT.
---
Damn. What would we all do without you? 
---
Ladies and Gentlemen, our Champion! He was right all along! We'd all be "to stupid to shit" without him!
---
If layering existed during Cata (I think individual zone sharding is what you're thinking of), they didn't do it hard enough on my server to handle the amount of people.  It took *hours* to get th first few quests done on release night, there were thousand of people fighting over mobs and quest item spawns, on top of the insane amount of WPvP happening all around.
---
Literally the only reason I didn't get totally bogged down leveling was because I stayed up for 40 hours grinding when others finally burned out after 18-24 hours.
---
The one when you know full well you caused the raid wipe.
---
I guess at it's core, the ones in the red box are the ones the devs didn't expect a normal player to level, seeing as you lose rep with far more useful factions and gain very little
---
I fully expect the devs intents for a normal player to arrive in desolace and increase rep with one of the centaur clans so they don't go in the box
---
42
---
Fun
---
during 9/11 they had a no fly zone over disneyland before the pentagon and other government buildings had it
---

---
What software do you recommend for multiboxing in classic?
---
I really have my heart set on playing a Warlock. The issue is—all of my friends I’m playing with are going Alliance.
---
Tell it to me straight: as a mainly PvP player, am I going to really, really struggle as an Alliance Warlock?
---
I mained a Mage in Vanilla and loved that. I’d be happy to give up my desire to play Lock if Mage is significantly more viable on Ally side in PvP. 
---
I’d love some perspectives from people who played Ally Locks, or people who played both Mages and locks.
---
Hi! I love it, I wondering what kind of case you used?
---
No, the percentages are very relevant. There's no reason to suggest any one country is going to have a larger percentage of players returning for Classic than another.
---
Then how does the layer cd works in that case?
---
It's an exaggeration, but there's a kernel of truth in there.
---
There were no rules on loot on this pug, if you needed you rolled! I was actually amazed when the raid leader followed through and gave me the items, was half expecting him to ninja one at least.
---
Most of the good players arent in his guild...
---
It's as it was in vanilla. Classic is supposed to be a faithful recreation.
---
This is just like asking for hybrid dps rebalancing and changing other tank specs to be comparable to warriors.
---
\&gt;  well, splitting it down the middle would create exactly these immersion breaking situations you're speaking out against.   
---
It will and it probably already does, which is why I went on to make suggestions for tweaks to the system that in my opinion will hide the transitions better.    
---
\&gt;  so which is it. do you know how it works or not?   
---
No one but the people working with blizzard's back-end will know (unless they come out and give us details) but we can make an educated guess.   
---
If you do not like my opinion take one from an AWS engineer &lt;[https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/06/26/episode-110-the-making-of-scholomance-melee-leeway-layering-commentary-av-in-the-beta-stress-test-races/](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/06/26/episode-110-the-making-of-scholomance-melee-leeway-layering-commentary-av-in-the-beta-stress-test-races/)\&gt; 1:05:00 mark or there abouts.
---
Yeah it's not nearly as big a difference as priest racials or weapon skill racials. Go dwarf if you want!
---
Farming for pallies is ez. Bubble and self heal can protect you from node competition and mob aggro. Plus you can consecrate and start farmer DM lashers as early as mid-50s (though DM won't be out til later).
---
First of, it's a bugged mechanic, that's why I personally think suggesting a change is acceptable.
---
The way it works currently makes hunter very bad in any 1v1 scenario to the point where Freezing Trap in most 1v1 matchup will eventually be completely left out at high level duels.
---
I recently got a Nintendo Switch so I'm playing Breath of the Wild which I should finish in the next couple weeks. I also bought FFVII, which I haven't played in about 16 years.
---
I have beta access for Classic but I've played a lot already and don't want to keep investing knowing that I'll be starting over in 2 months. It's just hard to get motivated with that in the back of my head.
---
None
---
No, I'm just following Blizzard's decisions and the numbers.
---
Not really.  Wetlands is the only tough part.  Boat to Auberdine, boat to Teldrassil.
---
It's also something for Night Elves who don't want to have to go all the way the other way just to do Deadmines.
---
With addons yes, without addons no.
---
The whole "alliance locks being useless" thing is kinda a meme. WotF only lasts like 5 seconds and doesn't work on Death Coil. Alliance locks may have to totem poke tremor and deal with WotS, but Horde locks have to fight paladins dispelling all of their magic debuffs (including fear).
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300005-3023-2500411303321003 
---
Idk might lack in end game PvE? But you can level as it and gank people if you find it fun. Killing certain classes with 3 openers is a breeze. But after that you have no CD's and some you cant kill by spambushing so you make them bleed/kite/deadly poison. When leveling just use gouge and kidney to set up your backstab, let your energy refresh in between gouge so you have max for a full second KS spam BS. Save your cooldowns if you see another player or wanna ditch mobs with vanish. If you want to use hemo you - swap out 1 pt of deadliness. You'll have strong crits out of stealth with spam backstab and hemo for the dbuff. Can't remember if bleed ticks used a hemo charge. Hope that helps!
---
haha omg i remember doing this as well!
---
I hope that all retards that don't get WHY this is a massive issue for CLASSIC, not only for the EU players, will read your post.
---
It's so fucking LOGICAL why EU needs language based realms, that I am amazed that there are (loads) of people that are dumb enough not to UNDERSTAND it.
---
Yeah, it was pretty ridiculous. I like drama as much as the next but this was unmitigated.
---
Nice! The first time is so fucking fun and epic!
---
yeah it should have definitely been a T8.5 catchup/buildup to ICC rather than that obscenely long period between Uld and ICC that it hosted
---
Not a big fan of the coarse language =/
---
Ikr!
---
Meh. They have a track record of ignoring beta feedback.
---
That's good to hear. I leveled a Druid as Balance in WotLK when it was legit and then healed at lvl 80, so I've never really experienced Feral at all except a TBC private server.
---
Looks like someone got rejected from whoever-this-streamer-is’s guild.
---
Feral Druid looking less and less optimal. Ele shaman not viable at all in Naxx. Even hunters have limited utility in PVE raids because of poor damage scaling. This means few raid slots for hunters.
---
Have you considered others classes/specs?
---
After watching that video showing the range on Tauren warrior's auto attacks, I'd agree. I can also understand hating Paladins (I was one) and between Lay on Hands and Bubble Hearth... even if you should have killed them, you won't.
---
We out here. I've been seeing classic wow pop up in all sorts of places on reddit.
---
More People &gt; Better WoW.
---
Yeah, surely two pieces of tech that do ostensibly incredibly similar things don't at all share the same risks or downfalls. Now who's being obtuse? Holy crap man lol.  Put the koolaid down for a sec.
---
Don't think anyone who raids with asmongold cares about hardcore raiding.
---
Why are you trying to talk to Asmongold fans when you clearly don't like them?
---
I have a vague memory of needing to level the character to get upper professions... wasn't it like lvl35 to be able to hit 300 or something?
---
SO you think because something is powerful or competitive it isn't rewarding? I'm a bit confused.
---
1. We don't even know how many realms we get
---
2. About 90% of the Classic players ARE NOT HERE, or on WOW forums.
---
Your "solution" is not going to fly.
---
Sorry.
---
Horde - Undead or Dwarf for alliance... Shadowguard sounds great on paper but there was a reason I TWO yes TWO undead priests which were shadow, for the Plague, it’s good game every three minutes in PvP whem u have it available.. I pondered troll preist for the release and I understand shadow guard can save ur butt ... but can’t beat the plague u win every time it’s unstoppable 1v1 even most 1v2 if u got the plague I’m not kidding u man. Strictly pve shadow I can see troll being better cuz the zerking but raids only need 1.
---
Because it’s fun clearing a raid with 50k people watching you. Makes it more meaningful.
---
Beta started like a month ago lmao, way too quick to hit the panic doomsday buttons. People saw a few bugs and mechanics and immediately went nuclear. While in beta.
---
I think you're right come to think of it. Well you're not right about being able to loot something you've already looted, you definitely couldn't do that, but the space would become dead and you couldn't click it, so it could make it very annoying to loot something underneath something else. In practice all it means if you were killing a stack of things you just move a bit while killing them instead of having them all stacked up super tight. *dat vanilla skill ceiling*
---
clout
---
And every day has felt longer than the last
---
Yea that’s what I can’t remember.
---
Isn't that space south of Silithus supposed to be the un-instanced AQ?
---
Hey just letting you know you responded to the wrong comment!
---
I suspect people would want to be in his guild for the clout. They might think they have a chance at twitch success through affiliation. I doubt that would work out for anyone but who knows. 
---
Or they’re just fans that happen to be good players.
---
Why is TipsOutBaby on the thumbnail?
---
Yeah wtf?
---
Coming from an OSRS / RS3 background to WOW (looking forward to trying Classic), both versions of the RS game have unique content and different “zones”, both with positives and negatives. I feel like if blizzard really listens to the player base (don’t know all the history there) and creates Classic specific zones it could provide content that could benefit the longevity of the game.
---
I've tried to be constructive. I've tried to be patient. But you're just another opinionated, willfully-ignorant armchair kiddo thinking he's God's gift to warrior-meta. So here it is in REALLY. SIMPLE. TERMS:  
---
If my Gladius Heroic Strikes for 163, and Tomahawk Heroic Strikes for 150, how *exactly* is the Damage Per Rage the same? Please don't come in here and shit talk someone who cleared Vanilla Naxx on his warrior main, **peasant**.  
---

---
Sorry it upsets you, I appreciate not everyone is ok with it, most episodes do have about 3-4 cuss words in there.
---
A percentage cut of the Twitch and YouTube revenues, obviously.
---
I had it custom made. Not sure if you can buy them like that.
---
It's not really a meme, it's just sometimes it matters a lot and other times it doesn't matter much at all. While levelling in STV/Tanaris where 20 rogues are deciding whether to gank you or not, when 80% of them are ud and it makes you a free kill it matters quite a lot. When you're 60 in an organised group it matters very little. It just comes down to what experience you value or want to build around.
---
I mean you don't need to be badly hurt to activate beserking, just to get the most use out of it. It's really not a big deal though, especially for healers. Priest racials and weapon skill racials are much more important. OP should do what he/she wants.
---
Doesn't seem like a good idea
---
What if you get invited to a group for a dungeon, it disbands and you have to look for a enw group ?
---
What if you were mining while needing to group ?
---
This is exactly what I thought... poster states that "2H is hard between 20 and 30s" then proceeds to outline same problem in a positive light for 1H.
---
iracing
---
What I can tell you is the internet is a very large place so dont be suprised when people like things that you dont think go together
---
&gt; Wotf is by far the better racial to have in pve over berseking , fear breaker on a healer eclipses slight cast speed tbh.
---
I understand most of the troll vs. undead arguments are clearly subjective, but this statement right here is 100% objectively wrong.
---
k.
---
Even if you don't play through it, as RTS isn't everyone's cup of tea, at least watch a cinematic compilation.
---
Anyone interested in leeway needs to listen to the latest Countdown to Classic podcast
---
idk about you but the game doesnt start at 60 for me. I'm all for that new content for when i level alts or to shake up the twinking meta's. fleshed out content would be a breath of fresh air in pretty much every level bracket
---
Lol this is a huge stretch. For all intents and purposes it makes absolutely no difference what race you chose for pally PvE healing.
---
Those quitters will be remembered, and they probably won't get far in the game anyway.
---
Never done it but was looking at maybe playing a lock earlier today and watched some pserver bg videos of a lock.  What looked way more annoying to me from those videos than WOTFS or Tremor was watching stuff get eaten by the grounding totem...
---
I mean, they shouldn't document how exactly to abuse layering, that'd be dumb.
---
Feels like it always did.
---
To be fair I haven't been around Reddit so I don't really know how it is here, just thought it was worth giving it a shot :D
---
If you pvp even slightly you’ll take advantage of the tier

The way how EU languages are split, the VAST MAJORITY of EU players will end up on the WRONG language realm.
---
Obligatory meme about retail player who thinks you can play Vanilla 1 handed. But yea you are pretty right 36 buttons is alot (12 x3 with ctrl shift). I think if you get into macroing for pvp and macroing your consumes/trinkets you can get up beyond there especially on like healing classes with multiple down ranks on bars.
---
I liked having ctrl being a modifier that specificially casts the specified spell on your focus target, and shift being a modifier that casts as mouseover. Quite nice for pvp

I’m using clique in beta, works the same but so far I’m unable to bind down ranked spells. Always reverts to highest rank.
---
Thanks for ur help. Very disappointing. Lol
---
\+5 weapon skill = significantly easier to hit ?? mobs.  If you don't think drinking faster makes a difference, you've never ran with impatient groups.
---
Shamans have an Ele/Resto spec that is good in BGs and perfectly acceptable in a casual raid setting. You can do BGs as a holy or disc priest but understand you will not be doing the killing and will mostly function as a pocket healer for warriors. Shadow priesr is actually pretty for 1v1 type PVP but be prepared to have a harder time finding PVE raid slots and to have people in BGs yell at you to pop out of shadow and heal melee the whole time instead.
---
How so? It literally changes the entire Hunter PvP meta by nerfing one of their strong points, namely the ability to control the fight
---
&gt;It is fair. You have been "raiding for weeks". Therefore you have been getting lots of loot. He logged on and got ONE item over you. Is this a big deal?
---
Because "luckily" it was the only one that dropped, had more dropped I would have said they got X amount of drops that night. Also I can't help but feel as though you're "moving a goal post" here.
---
You're focused on the technology which is the less important part in order to drudge up some sort of crisis that never existed, and ignoring the major flaw in your argument. Testing layering solutions had no reason to happen "on the live servers for over a couple years now" because the system is working perfectly as intended. Why would Blizzard test an ICD on sharding when they want you to be able to immediately swap shards at will? This solution took 1.5 months to come about because there was never a need to try it before. Why is that so hard to understand? There is nothing similar about trying to limit layering transitions to preserve a certain experience and how people transition to shards in the current game. 
---
And moreover you've been reassured that the layering experience is not a part of the classic game but insist on finding something to worry about. If I'm "drinking kool aid" for being logical and believing the relatively direct statement that this tech is not considered a part of the game experience then what does that make you, just an average, thoughtless whiner?
---
In that case I suggest we call it FM for "freedom mines". That'll teach those stinky euros to do things differently.
---
I thought the same thing. It is so stupid. Fixes do not mean that they intend to keep layering for longer.
---
What makes you think it’s a bug? And if it is then why did it take Blizzard 2 years to fix it? (Assuming they changed it in TBC)
---
Highest dps item until level 40 my man ..said it in my post ..after I get to level 12 on my gnome I'll mountain hop to menthil..go to SW..do the warrior quest then Hogger..to get the staff.. lol keep on keeping on bro let me know if you need any tips
---
It's almost like Blizzard has a track record of not fixing things in beta.
---
There are still bugs in BFA that were reported and found in Legion beta.
---
What BR game or survival game would even come close to the size of wow lol.
---
It’s funny that people unironically believe Activision has fuck all to do with classic
---
Fem nelf hunter!
---
there is no videogame on earth that rewards the player who was faster 100% of the time. Fighting games typically run at 60 frames a second. That means that any inputs within that 1/60th of a second count as being at the same time despite one person being faster. Overwatch I believe is a 20 tick game, which means there are 20 "batches" a second.
---
Fighting game - 16 ms batches
---
Overwatch - 50 ms batches
---
Classic - 400 ms batches
---
It's now your job to objectively prove where the line "should be" and support your argument.
---
An American, obviously.
---
No wonder you DON'T GET BASIC LOGIC, because you have NO IDEA what Europe is.
---
They'll be announcing the realm list at 3PM PST August 12th.
---
actually its more like AtP and Def Rating is whats needed on the staves.
---
read the manual like 20 times.... mostly in school and bio...
---
I'm swedish....
---
Thank you very much for the quick reply, that’s great news!
---
This is still speculation, so no one knows for sure. My guess? It only affects the player changing layers, and it's on a short cooldown (less than five minutes). It shouldn't affect the party leader or other party members at all. 
---
Just a guess, though.
---
It also messes with the pace of dungeons.
---
&gt;real Classic.
---
It was Vanilla. We had Vanilla, then we had Vanilla Private servers, now we have Classic.
---
This community is #NOCHANGES. Be careful.
---
Not only will they be announcing server names early, they are going to allow you to create your characters early and reserve names.
---
You have presented an argument that legit rmt should exist in classic wow because gold sellers bad. I presented an example of a game with gold sellers that's doing fine in it's in game economy. You dismissed that the example is not relevant due to reasons. I then touched on another point you made: that gold sellers definitely commit fraud. Are you claiming that fraud is not a problem in FFXIV, a game in which you've expressed that the gold selling isn't an issue?
---
I am trying to find consistency in your position. I am allowing you to present it. I am staying very loose in my presentation of my own position so that we can get to the bottom of yours in your own words.
---
Is that clear enough?
---
My position is actually simply that you're not presenting your own position in a fair manner. You may be biased for one reason or another.
---
For the record, I don't want any legit rmt in classic. I want the risk of ban hovering over anyone who dips into the black market.
---
I've also spoken to tanks back on vanilla that had to buy gold to keep afloat while raiding. Perhaps there could be a balance, such as a rework of repair costs for raid tanks...
---
But I don't want legit rmt. I don't want someone to be able to pay Blizzard, specifically Blizzard, real money for in game currency.
---
That's mostly a problem if yo're assuming there's only 1 person doing it. Anything rare enough will have competition.
---
Pick up the WoW Diary on Amazon
---
If most of the other vanilla patches besides 1.12 didn’t have this DR bug then I’d say blizzard should fix it.  But If this bug was in most of the vanilla patches then i’d say leave it as Is.
---
I was either with the priest or a prot pally who took the aggro while I whailed away at the mobs. Sometimes I was alone but 80% I had a partner, also sometimes I would redo a few quests I already did to help them catch up or vice versa (still good xp from killing mobs).
---
We never really scheduled anything we just happened to have the same play times (east cost, after 5pm, online most days etc.)
---
Yeah that's a fair point, especially for Syndicate. They seem like the most pointless faction in all of Classic.
---
Possibly true but everyones strategy seems to be "get ahead of the pack" if everyone's trying to do thst then no one is.
---
Oh shit need to start planning my retreat
---
4 reck stacks means 4 attacks at once, if you have 1 stack of reck it means you get your attack +1 stack of reck.

/sit does work but when spell batched, so you need to sit and right before getting hit you get up (move) so it calculates the crit as like you were standing and you get the proc.
---
Is that the same day that they announce the realm list? Gotta get my names on lock!
---
Thanks for all the info guys I’m a bit out of the loop, but super pumped to relive Vanilla!
---
If you just commit to one character Day one, it will be so much easier to make alts later on where you can be more picky. Literally any class, just pick a random one from a dice roll if you have to, just get it to level 60 fast so you can make friends with the elite types and get free loot from MC/BWL.
---
Here we go again!

WoD was abandoned halfway in.

"It's the beards..."
---
Hi a bit out of the loop, but super pumped to relive vanilla!, I'm dad.
---
Both Heroic Strike and Cleave replace the next auto attack. Heroic Strike costs 15 rage and does weapon damage+44. Cleave costs 20 rage and does weapon damage+5 to two targets.
---
FYI it's only up to 3 names.
---
It was always smaller than other mmos of it's generation
---
Turn on aspect of the cheetah and never look back
---
It's mostly the amount of running you do in them. In WoW you typically are just moving around a small zone, but sometimes you have to run quite far to get to a new zone, and it felt like a much bigger journey when I was younger. But now I'm kind of used to running far distances from other games.
---
/script Thanks("target")
---
/script if not UnitExists("Supermacro") then CastSpellByName("Cry()"); end
---
Imagine being so clueless and still thinking you're good. At this point I have to assume you're trolling if you can't understand that you're paying 15 rage for 11 damage regardless of weapon speed. The fact that you think the base weapon damage **has anything whatsoever with the rage effectiveness of heroic strike** is fucking downright hilarious.
---
Let's say you have two 10 dps weapons. One is 2.0 speed (average damage of 20), one is 1.0 speed (average damage of 10). You attack for 60 seconds. During those 60 seconds, you also cast heroic strike 10 times.
---
For the 2.0 speed weapon, you swing 30 times, 20 being regular hits and 10 being heroic rank 1 strikes. Your 20 white hits total 400 damage. Your 10 heroic strikes total 310 damage (20 base+11 heroic strike damage per swing). **Total damage done: 710 damage.**
---
For the 1.0 speed weapon, you swing 60 times, 50 being regular hits and 10 being heroic strike rank 1 strikes. Your 50 white hits total 500 damage. Your 10 heroic strikes total 210 damage (10 base+11 heroic strike damage per swing). **Total damage done: 710 damage.**
---
Good talk, **peasant**.
---
I get your point, but still...
---
Once the both of us hit 60 our play styles differ a lot. She will be my golden ticket into raids in most cases!
---
The thing is there's 50 things that could be considered *bugs* in vanilla. Why is Druids BIS items lvl 30 blues? Why do all of pally tanking talents require them to be crit? Why is garrote complete garbage? Why don't HoTs stack? Why are hunter pets so useless at 60?  
---
Vanilla is a very wonky game, but the point of Classic is to bring that wonkiness back, just as it was in 2005/2006. I can appreciate that for people that have been playing private servers for years (and are a huge reason of why we are getting Classic) that some changes have been made there that are 100% intelligent improvements would want those improvements in Classic, but that's just not going to happen. Blizzard has very clearly spelled out what Classic is, and that's a 1.12 recreation, as it was in 2006. After launch I think people will come around to some very minor changes that make some things less broken, and this would be a good candidate - but at the moment #nochanges is incredibly strong. If you find videos of something working a certain way in vanilla, that is what Blizzard will be doing for Classic. 'Because it worked a certain way on Private servers' is not a good argument for change - right now at least.
---
the problem is with the current developers mentality, its very unlikely we will get any content that will meet vanillas standards.
---
I mean, it doesn't matter if there are hundreds of people layer swapping to do that, it's still fucked up and shouldn't be happening and needs to be fixed. They're still abusing the system to gain an advantage over players playing properly exploring the world they're in to gather herbs. (aka not layer hopping so they're traveling all over looking for stuff etc)
---
Ok, my bad...but it isn't actually.
---
So, are the cards DEALT ? Or they aren't? 
---
I am asking again, because it is June 27th here...and there are TWO more months until the cards are ACTUALLY dealt.
---
Just want to know if you consider this language issue a DONE DEAL for r/classicwow , and we should just "work" with what he have instead of keep PUSHING for language based realms?
---
Dude...
---
In vanilla you got the mount for being the scepter bearer and opening AQ, BUT NO TITLE. The title was added in TBC.
---
I seem to recall seeing it posted/written that layering is the first couple weeks, not necessarily the entirety of the first phase.
---
Either orc or ud. Both races are lackluster for pve.
---
Same here, lol
---
similar one is derping around on the edge of winterspring and then falling off down to azshara and dying in the mountains. 
---
either you run from azshara -&gt; ashenvale -&gt; felwood -&gt; winterspring and jump down to your corpse or you eat the spirit sickness.
---
&gt; on the live servers for over a couple years now" because the system is working perfectly as intended.
---
Ok I guess you just haven't been paying attention then... I'm done.
---
I don’t understand why everyone is so negative about Classic. Honestly looking at the general posts and talks on twitter it almost seems like people want it to be awful.
---
That's not a strawman, just an assumption
---
No, to me it still feels overwhelmingly big compared to Retail (and BR games)
---
Mostly because you can find Vehicle in the BR that I used to play or the fact that you can have a level 1 mount on Retail.
---
I think both of them run from Thorium Point
---
Not going to happen
---
It was in the game in vanilla, patch 1.9 with AQ event
---
People complain it'll ruin the economy, but I don't understand how.  
---
More players = more layers = more resources. Assuming a equal number of players are farming per layer, price shouldn't be affected.  
---
ECON101. Supply and Demand.
---
*Shendralar PTSD kicks in*
---
More than enough, will probably only have 2 toons!
---
Because it's fairly integral to how previous expansions played, especially in PvP. Streamline it and you'll create a significantly different experience than what many people are looking forward for.
---
Blizzard should just pull the plug on Classic and tell everyone to go F themselves, shut down all game services and liquidate the company.  Seriously unforgiving job, who would want to spend all this time, money and dedication for a bunch of ungrateful neckbeards.
---
I wouldn't mind them monopolizing a sever or two like most language groups here will do anyway, but taking the fact that we may not even have enough servers to house the europeans in this matter as it is.
---
All this while they have their own freakin' region. I mean come on.
---
People are terrible.
---
At a local frame maker, in Amsterdam :)
---
I mean it was announced 17 years ago, roughly
---
I mean even in retail now on my gtx 1080, I7 4.5ghz with max/min foreground fps settings turned off I can max the graphics and get between 200-350 fps depending on whats going on. So with classic being less demanding and generally less crowded it will surely run extremely well.
---
&gt; I presented an example of a game with gold sellers that's doing fine in it's in game economy.
---
You're not comparing like with like. FFXIV is hardly a P2W MMO.
---
&gt; You dismissed that the example is not relevant due to reasons.
---
Reasons you don't seem to understand: FFXIV doesn't lean on Gil heavily as a gate-keep to power progression.
---
&gt; I don't want legit rmt. I don't want someone to be able to pay Blizzard, specifically Blizzard, real money for in game currency.
---
This is where *your* inconsistency lies. You seem to think that RMT can't exist without a WoW Token. You're mistaken. **The default position here is that RMT will be in the game and very much have a real presence throughout Classic.**
---
The only thing we both disagree on is whether or not it's better to have young players, at-risk players, handicapped players being lured in by a newly inflated black market, or to destroy that black market and all its attentive risks by undercutting them via a legitimate company.
---
I think there's a moral argument to preventing as much harm as possible by eliminating black markets. You're arguing that we should keep black markets because they act as a deterrent. Not only has that never been borne out in reality, but it's also naive.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Bang_a_Gong!
---
funny because the quest was added in 1.9 and it had scarab lord as a reward
---
But if your attempt to emulate the old way breaks it in the wrong direction, it probably isn't worth it
---
Bleeding it’s horror
---
Horde or Alliance? (shaman or pally)
---
I'm planning to main a hunter, but both Paladin and Shaman look fairly appealing for an alt.  If my past is any indicator, I'll probably mostly PUG 5 mans and solo queue BGs (though I'm still hopeful I'll be steady enough to find a place in a semi-casual guild this time around) and level alts (altoholic checking in). 
---
I'm leaning a little towards alliance for paladin access as playing a holy pally looks more fun than resto shaman, but ele shaman could be fun to mix it up and hard to argue with the orc hardiness.  Not sure on ret pally or prot pally viability for pvp.
---
I've also been looking at mage or warlock as possible alts.
---
And those people do not represent the majority of this sub
---
I feel personally attacked by this comment.
---
It's likely this was introduced in patch 1.10
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0
---
&gt;Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns. 
---
The patch note isn't detailed, but you'd assume they just meant that it DR's with itself, not that they secretly added it to Scatter's DR category.
---
Vanilla feels huge compared to retail
---
If there was an addon with flight path times that would be preeetty sweet.
---
It worked this way until TBC from what I've seen
---
3 layers = 3 times more supply = 3 times more players on server = 3 times more demand.  
---
Nothing changes. And anything that's lucrative enough will encourage exploiters, than everyone will exploit.
---
Yes, which is Why I am estimating the cost of cleave at 25 rage: because you lose the rage gained on an autoattack every time you use it. And similarly, I am estimating heroic strike to cost 15+ rage because you presumably get a lot less rage per hit when dual wielding, and because you might talent it if you are going a heroic strike build. I did round heavily in favor of heroic strike, but that's just because it makes the math as unfavorable to my argument as possible. 
---
I estimate cleave at 10+ your weapon damage because you get 5 damage on 2 targets (10), plus your weapon damage on one target (weapon damage). total damage? weapon damage+10. 
---
You are right on the damage of heroic strike though. I don't know why I thought it was 40. It is 44. 
---
Really though, to be fair to cleave: I did deliberately pick one of the best possible levels for heroic strike: right as you get a new rank of heroic strike but 4 levels after your most recent rank of cleave.
---
And even at 44, I don't think it's close.
---
By doing that, you just accept. There has to be a financial threat for them. "Meh, I'm going to play anyway" // "We will show them and create inofficial language servers!! (/stinkyfinger)! TAKE THAT BLIZZARD!" won't cut it.
---
The meta ended when tbc came out. Pserver meta shouldn’t be considered when making classic wow. Don’t get me wrong, this sucks for all hunter players and the class will be very different than what we’re used to on private servers but, this bug should not be changed. I’m heavily considering rolling a different class because of how different hunters are compared to private servers and maybe you should too.
---
Best of luck to ya
---
&gt; Feral Druid looking less and less optimal.

---
&gt;  No big deal.

Burn the heretic.
---
I had the frame custom made. The frame maker used special 'museum glass' which reduces glare and has higher UV protection.
---
That poll bias thing was entirely legitimate, anyone who knows ANYTHING about polls will tell you that showing results at a polling station is one of the worst things you can do if you want an impartial poll.
---
However screeching after it was hidden is ridiculous.
---
Well said !
---
COMPANYYYY
---
No it wasn't. The reward for the opener was the mount. The title was added in 2.0 or 2.1.
---
U can calculate lots of stuff based on probabilities . Its at some point still not exact but should come pretty close.
---
Problem with that is, its only a median value you get for very static fights.
---
Due to the random nature if ignite rolls  the damage will fluctuate quite big. Not thinking about having scorch crits in the ignite.
---
TLDR: u can do pretty precise statistic calc but real wordl is always very different.
---
The underleveled dungeon runs have been super enjoyable for me to watch. This was cool
---
Stuck between Rogue and Warlock. I love seeing big crits. 
---
My hesitation with Lock is they don't really start becoming a beast until AQ is released, while Rogues are pretty consistently strong throughout. And most guilds would probably rather have a Rogue in a raid than a lock.  
---
My focus is on gearing up until BG's are released and then splitting time between both.
---
Leaning towards leveling Rogue first then leveling Lock in my spare time. 
---
Of course, you should be carrying both in raids. Whether you’re called to offtank or not will depend on the situation.
---
Ah shit
---
If it's a bug it should be changed imo. It's quite the impacting bug for Hunters aswell and paired with the leeway it Hunters look at being top tier in pvp to being awful.
---
the title was not added until TBC
---
How does it change anything that always was?
---
This. The first day will most likely be absolute chaos, even unplayable. Best to give it a day or two. I’m taking the following week off
---
alright, i had no idea. i just assumed it was granted when you turned in bang a gong
---
I assumed this happened when people did the massive raid groups where they would invade sw to kill Varian, and then use the tram to get to Ironforge to kill Magni. Just unlucky to die right there.
---
That dude is so heated haha
---
I hope you guys get a better hand from Blizz before relase, having to deal with peeps like him doesn't seem like much fun
---
I still have my original set of 4! i wanna frame them so bad
---
Hey there. Id love a chance to discuss you plans for classic if you have some free time? I could give the typical info dump but I'd rather have a conversation. Feel free to reach me at wildgunmen#1302 on bnet or wildgunmen#9537 on discord.
---
In 10 years maybe.
---
You think a pve healing pally should chose a race because they get +5 wep skill or because of the difference 5% spirit makes to drinking speed. Jesus, wait till you learn about the difference in base stats! You know they also start with difference weapons right? Could make all the difference!
---
I healed :) Rolled warrior before tho and hunter.
---
I have a very similar system. 7700k @ 5ghz, 64gb ram and a 1080. On 1080p I’m smashing wow but I fear when I pick up the 38GL950G 3840 x 1600 monitor it’s going to show its weaknesses. Time will tell I guess hopefully they’ve implemented dx12 by then.
---
So did I, at some point. As I wrote above, I thought Scarab Lord, Justicar and Conqueror were all in vanilla, but someone told me they weren't. I went to try and find out for myself, and it turns out they were both added in TBC patches.
---
I read mine so many times, that the pages are falling out.

I see what your saying. However, to achieve a “straighter” path for one particular route you may sacrifice a “straighter route for a different one.
---
i.e... if going A -&gt; C is a relatively straight path, however, if you have B than you divert to A -&gt; B -&gt; C , making it longer.  Then a different path, D -&gt; E requires you to go through F (D -&gt; F -&gt; E) if you don’t have B, where the fastest route would be D -&gt; B -&gt; E. 
---
I hope that makes sense, I guess could make an illustration to show the idea more clearly.  However, I’m not sure if this is going to be true for Classic (although I kind of remember this sort of happening, though was not a huge deal) even if it was I don’t think it would make sense as opposed to trying to get all possible flight paths.
---
TL;DR - IF this will be the case (or even was), it may help with one FP while having an adverse effect on another.
---
I really enjoyed running dungeons in vanilla. Unfortunately once people get raid geared it trivializes these dungeons. I'm excited for phase 1 and will probably stop after that.
---
Saw tipsout face in post.
---
Didn’t read.
---
I think I’ll go to the next thread now.
---
Personal loot actually originated in MoP but it was optional. Then WoD came out and made all dungeon loot personal... then BFA came out and made all raid loot personal.
---
There is no more ML, even if you raid with your entire guild. Forced personal loot is one of the many things BFA took steps backwards on.
---
PoE is the only game that existed in this world where i literally have to stop myself from playing.

---
Global cooldown's back baybeeee
---
You've got to be shitting me. You're paying for 11 damage on your next hit, which means you're also giving all rage generation on that swing up. Your example doesn't even factor in the reality of how Parry Haste is superior on slower weapons *or* how the vast majority of mobs have static block values(bears, wolves...**murlocs**) *or* how armor mitigates damage by a percentage, which is harsher on smaller numbers than large due to the nature of integer-only damage. These mechanics all vastly favor slower, harder hitting attacks. I can see you still have much to learn. Now go work my fields.
---
Why are wintersaber trainers a separate faction but not any other trainers?
---
At the end of the day, I don't think it really matters. Joana has already said he's not pushing hard for world first this time around. He said he'll be sleeping on a normal schedule. That alone is going to hurt him.  
---
I don't think he minds if he doesn't get world first.
---
whats funny is at the time the run back to your body system was lauded for being the least punitive system out there
---
most games made you lose xp
---
Yeah it's definitely harder than frostbolt or shadowbolt. Even with the wonky improved shadowbolt math it can still be very accurately predicted. Ignite however seems very random.

This. I feel uncomfortable to enter a raid and not be crit capped. Even 1% chance crit by a boss is good enough to wipe. 
---
 +Is shield block going to be up 100% of the time ? Tiger boss in ZG, tanking multiple lvl+61 mobs, bosses who can swing faster than your shield block CD can screw you (50% haste from parry). 
---
 I did tanked back in vanilla while not being def capped and my healers weren’t happy. Ofc the fights were still doable but the situations can be hectic.
---
I hear you man.  Layering has its cons. But those cons are likely to be (a) localized to starting zones (b) temporary and (c) vastly outweighed by the benefits.  
---
Even if there are a couple of bugs (sounds like we’ve identified most of the abuses/brokenness), it’s still a better option than a minimum of 600 people in tirisfal waiting on Samuel Fipp’s spawn point for the first week.
---
Like even this website, the validity and truth of a post is for the user base to decide. The website utilizes up and downvoting which is currently underutilized. We believe this process will generate far more accurate information than sourcing an individual (a la WoWHead) to write a single guide on the subject -often rife with misinformation.
---
And to answer you last question, why would anyone post anything anywhere? To have their opinion heard.
---
Right? What a confusing “scale”. Doesn’t make any sense at all. Vanilla pvp has so many nuanced scenarios that you can’t categorize everything into one massive pool and say this is better than that.
---
False equivalencies.
---
Starting with different weapons has nothing to do with end-game.  5 weapon skill can apply at end-game.
---
Variances in base stats are less than a 5% bonus to a stat.  Also, Spirit is still useful for Paladins within the fight if you have a period where you don't need to spam Flash of Light.
---
I think if you're looking at racials as a basis for picking a class, those are racials that matter.
---
To what degree these matter is up to you.  If you think they don't matter at all, don't mock those who decide that they do and then put in the time and effort to figure out what they want.
---
If they stated they were going to Layer Kalimdor or Shard it and it was a blind taste test, NO ONE would know which was which. It's the same fucking thing, Layering is just more than one zone.         
---
         
---
My understanding of Sharding is when a zone reaches a certain amount of player population for the area, excess players are phased to a separate "Shard" or simulated server to help with overcrowding.             
---
            
---
My understanding of layering is when a layer reaches a certain amount of player population for the world, excess players are phased to a separate "Layer" or simulated server to help with overcrowding.            
---
                 
---
I dont think they exactly reinvented the fucking wheel on this?
---
What's the Syndicate again? At first I thought that's the Ravenholdt guys but apparently not. It's the only faction I don't remember off the top of my head
---
I think you are over stating things, and I'm fine with it being this way. I got used to it in vanilla, then everyone told me I was remember wrong on p servers.
---
Scatter is still a great interrupt and way to get distance. And you shouldn't have to scatter to trap someone, anyway, unless they add a delay to freezing trap.
---
Unless its an hour it doesn't matter
---
I absolutely agree with you that private servers shouldn't be used as a reference point, my bad I worded it poorly. However I feel like this is such a big bug that goes against all the core principles regarding how DR's work in the game, that it's atleast worth discussing it. Hypothetically, IF Freezing Trap DOESN'T DR with a similiar type of CC as Scatter Shot (Blind for example), don't you think it's painfully obvious something is wrong and should deserve atleast an explanation rather than just spout out #NoChanges? Interested to see what your thoughts are about this. 
---
Regarding my class choice, I was still keeping things open even before this bug got noticed haha.
---
Are any of these BR's?
---
No, not in classic there isn't.
---
like i said, there is 100% some skill to it, for sure, i just think as a game design concept it's wonky and unsatisfying, not that it isn't fair
---
Stockades/RFC say hi. Granted neither are a level 50 instance but there is precedence for hard to access dungeons along faction lines
---
People actually thought that it was the most punitive? Lol
---
I have memories of FF11 and de-leveling because I died. That made me so mad as a teenager
---
Shout out to all of the vanilla bloodsail admiral's
---
There's speculation that they'll change it to 5, but it is yet to be decided.
---
Most people just play on the faction the majority of their friends are on. It’s a pretty even mix overall.
---
This problem is very real. Back in vanilla, I made a personal rule for myself to always at least get my corpse before rage-logging after a death. The login-screen ghost would deter me from playing that character for days.
---
I don't see it this way... This is an MO with two factions, part of the fun is to hinder the players of the other faction.. It fuels the hate and makes this game feel real
---
diablo 2, ladder was just reset so its like im back in 2004
---
Exactly, 3 toons... 1 main, 1 alt, 1 bank and you’ll be sitting pretty.
---
I'm not sure, just google when the name reservations will be available.
---
I'm just glad it is established that this is how it was in vanilla. People have been telling me I'm wrong about that for years, because private servers are wrong on it.
---
If it's a completely separate project. As in I can still play vanilla in 5 years. If that were the case I wouldnt have any issue with them making new content for people who dont want to play vanilla.
---
anal rodeo is so much fun
---
everyone hates the archers but theyre not so bad if you just run run run
---
blind not sharing DR with even itself, paired with the apparent buff to druid dps on PS is classic "the poor get poorer" and the "rich get richer".
---
It's actually getting to be funny.
---
But isn't that part of the reason why this is happening? If they get no complaints they'll expect it to be fine. The beta isn't a complete version but it should be what the final product was mostly intended to look like. Obviously layering causes a lot of issues in its current state, but people complaining and pointing them out is what's causing it to change.
---
That would make sense only if they had similar cool class only places like that for every class. Otherwise it would be too much playing favorites
---
*popcorn*
---
Also, many of the high level crafting recipes/patterns are bind-on-pickup and only drop from high level dungeons. Meaning you have to take your crafting char in there.
---
the remastered version has better graphics, has password coop, 6 player limit, and some other cool differences
---
I feel like this was a bug due to either someone having a quest item still on the mob or lag.
---
Poor human, asking to get ganked
---
Agi on Plate is really only beneficial to Fury Warrior. I would rather see STR on the item than AGI for Arms or Prot.
---
LEAST punitive
---
Can't have it both ways. If we start making balance changes here, just because pservers got that wrong and people playing on it are used to how it was there (bug or not), where do we stop?
---
Retain the DR. Hunters will need to adapt to it.
---
I mean its a game from 2004 that is going to be running on computers from 2019. In theory it should run smoothly even on a $70 laptop. It is possible that Blizzard will poorly optimize the game which would be really unfortunate. The current game is optimized like shit. One of the biggest selling points for Classic is not having to wait in loading screens for 10 minutes. So hopefully they don't mess that up.
---
Just to add further to this. There are Ravasaur Trainer NPCs in Un'goro Crater that was intended to be the horde equivalent. But they didn't offer any quests in Vanilla, and weren't completed until WotLK.
---
Any good guides on this? Like, do I go to their actual lvl 1 zone, start at Darn?
---
Nah the title was added retroactively only the mount was awarded at the event
---
the normal nightsaber mounts are part of teldrassil
---
the wintersaber ones are different
---
Ah cool, I'll have to grab it if it's on this summer sale.  I remember having to download an add-on or something for the prepare to die edition that unlocked the higher res textures.

when you say "their vision", "they" arent there anymore, after many years naturally, and recently with the massive layoffs and resignations.  The vision now is microtransactions.  I dont want current Blizzard to get any foot in the door, I want classic wow, flaws and all.
---
Make sure to dispel the MT first.
---
I'm going to be playing with my brother-in-law and his homies. It looks like they will be priest, warlock, and shaman so I would best help the group as a tank. My current plan is warrior with herb/alchemy and fishing when they aren't online for fun and gold.  Should I consider being a feral HOTW druid instead? I don't know how much we will raid as we all want to take our time and enjoy all the different aspects of the game. I'd appreciate any advice to help me choose between these two.

[https://www.wowhead.com/item=46102/whistle-of-the-venomhide-ravasaur](https://www.wowhead.com/item=46102/whistle-of-the-venomhide-ravasaur) but it was not added until  3.2.0.10026 so it is not in classic.

Are talent points rewarded every even level or am I remembering wrong?

i read a breakdown of it recently actually which seems to indicate the opposite, ill dig it up

---
That's you're opinion. Me playing normally will involve logging and questing through the world in a population that the world content was designed for.
---
For a knife with no legs she sure does get around.
---
Apart of giving good advice isn't just telling the effects, but how big the effect is. For instance, human and dwarf have different strength and agility at level 60. That is an objective difference. Yet you didn't mention it in your post, probably not because you didn't know that, but because it is trivially insignificant to a lvl 60 pve holy pally. In fact it would be very bad advice to tell a newbie that you should chose your holy paly based on the agility difference between human and dwarf. Just like it would be to chose based on weapon skill.
---
Is dx12 usable for intel though? I thought that was AMD only. But surely it will be man!

I remember there was some buggy patch at some point...I had a tab-targetting mishap on my warrior in LBRS up on that ledge when you first enter when I tried to intercept a monster ... I pathed through the whole dungeon down to a mob on the lower level (who was not in intercept range...). That was a wipe but it was hilarious.
---
got them: https://wowclassicpopulation.com
---
They’re going to stat squish everything to 60 and we’re going to get 60 cap BC, 60 cap WotLK and so on.
---
They were the bandits that you fought in the Arathi Highlands and Alterac Mountains. They were rivals with Ravenholdt and gaining rep with them decreased your rep with the other.
---
Weird, I have never ever in all my vanilla life experienced a tank demanding orbs. Never.
---
True, my guild during Wrath had a couple of in game males sound very female on vent. They said that the reason they played a male was so they didn't get bothered in game by random guys. I definitely understand.
---
it doesn't solve anything, the only fix would be a layering on a zone or level basis just like everyone suggested (or no layering at all but I'm not that delusional).
---
Blizzard hasn't communicated at all regarding layering and EU server you can't blame people for complaining and/or being worried.
---
TBC
---
You can just crosspost it.
---
Shaman were originally supposed to be tanks too, so I wonder if that factored into their early class divisions.
---
LFM that want to go be the Goonies and face a pirate!
---
I keep seeing all of these "Played in Vanilla, looking for old guild mates" posts.  None of them I looked at had responses from old guild mates, but I made one that was only up for about 30 minutes before it was removed by the mods.  Luckily, one of my old guild mates saw it and responded during that time, so now I've connected with about 5 guys that used to be in my Vanilla guild.  Because of that, I wish the mods would not take them down.  Not everyone knows about [vanillafriends.com](https://vanillafriends.com), so not many people have signed up (although I did find one more guild mate using that site).
---
Thought you guys might enjoy this story, perhaps learn from my mistakes if you are planning on doing some shady behavior when classic launches!

---
Or maybe the Classic team was watching all the layering shenanigans happening, which is why they wanted this beta: to test layering (amongst other things), and saw the ways they could fix layering to make it more in line with how they want it to be.
---
It's not necessarily because they saw our little subreddit complaining constantly. They have eyes of their own. 
---
I fully believe that they have listened to a lot out our feedback, both here and on the official forums, but personally I think this one was a no-brainer. They were always intending on using this beta and these stress tests to find out how layering was working, and to improve it.
---
Is this the thread where we post "I told you so"?
---
I’m torn between Druid and priest. I’ve always been a support oriented player and really enjoy group play whether it’s PvE or PvP. I’ve played Druid a lot and have never played priest before. I like the class aesthetic of the Druid and the natural aspect. I also kinda like that they are underplayed so it feels more like a novel way to play. Then again, I haven’t played priest so it will be a whole new novel experience for me. I like the power priests have to directly heal and also dispel and damage if needed. The leveling experience as Druid has always been incredibly fun to me— the versatility of being able to heal/dps/tank has always made finding a group easy and made the runs fun.
---
This is why im making a Nelf Spriest
---
The horde flight path ends right there at the cliff.
---
Shadowmeald + Mind Controll + Unassuming horde = ????
---
You can guess what happens next.
---
Hmmmm since I’m going to play a mage I was going to take herbalism and alchemy. But maybe I’ll just take herbalism and mining because I remember making a fortune on bars
---
I only remember this because people would make alts to get them to 35 just for crafting stuff so their main could have Engineering.
---
I agree that this topic should be discussed as we haven’t dealt with a situation like this at all yet. Either way though I don’t see blizz changing it. Everyone who Is not a hunter would probably cry a river if they did change it. Wish I kept my class options open like you. I was dead set on hunter and now I don’t even know if I want to play classic. Fucking sucks
---
Now go back and include how quickly you can traverse each map from these games. That'll give me a real idea of the game's perceived size.
---
You'll have no tank and no run :D
---
 If I built a time machine it would solely be to read the Classic WoW forum.
---
Tbf, you’re character has been a participant in the battles killing every major baddie, even being among the group that the Lich Kill attempts to resurrect citing “the greatest heroes Azeroth has to offer” (paraphrase). You’re one of the leaders of your class, having wielded powerful artifacts (even though we could get every weapon in-game, I’d assume canonically we only obtained one which is still a feat).
---
In the years that have passed in-game, our characters isn’t a spec of sand. You are no longer a no-name. You’re one of the greatest heroes Azeroth has ever seen.
---
The only problem with this, is you STILL do bullshit fetch quests for some bread maker, or digging through some animal’s feces (iirc this has happened in every expansion in some fashion). Those quests aren’t for someone of your stature, and causes a bit of a disconnect.
---
Welcome to the Internet.
---
Feedback does not include claims that it will never be fixed and will definitely go live this way and it's a conspiracy to make Classic the same as BFA.
---
just from a logical pov, i don't think that's accurate. this would effectively mean you cannot group with players from other players as much as you want to. i don't think that's blizzard's intention.
---
Those same people would probably bug a "Hello World!" program
---
Well since WoW has instant summons to anywhere on the map and these games don't, WoW loses there.
---
Incorrect. Shield Block makes you immune to crushing blows by pushing them off the attack table. It's still possible to be critically hit, no matter your current defense skill.
---
Hey, I think this was fixed in the latest patch
---
I just love how people like you always try to paint community as bad and the corporation as good. You fanboys never change, it's always the same story with you. Community = bad, corporation = good. The same corporation that brought you BfA and never fixed the feedback that was in BfA beta. When will you learn?
---
Druid requires more work for less results than a warrior. If your plan is to tank then warrior straight up easier for better results and having a shaman for windfury is huge.
---
That being said the best thing to do is play what you want especially if casual. Druid is fully capable of tanking everything in 5mans, you just have to farm and buy a lot of random items that are very good for feral like warden staff and heart of the mountain.
---
Yohn is here. The party can begin.
---
Many of them can be.
---
Blacklisting doesn’t actually do anything. I plan to get on a couple of lists myself.
---
For time. If I want to keep a run going and am low on mana I put renew and shield on tank and sit and drink and I know they will be fine until I am full and can join in.
---
Stealing this idea....
---
I don't think that really answers any of my questions then...
---
This feels like a genuine beta test. I think they might do an open beta weekend to really test the layering tech.
---
I’m a bit confused on this 1.12 stuff. 
---
Like they’ve said it’s a staged rollout with content coming in groups like 1.1 &amp; 1.2 being live on release day. Then they’ve said they can’t use 1.12 item stats at first because there was a massive overhaul like a year in and many items would be game breaking in 1.1 with 1.12 stats. But I keep hearing ppl saying things will be 1.12 on release day. Huh?
---
As I understand it:
---
World content, as in dungeons, raids, battlegrounds, world bosses and zone changes will roll out in the same order and on a schedule similar to how they did in vanilla. So the world won’t be 1.12 at release. In fact it won’t for 18 months or more. 
---
Loot for the most part will become available as its drop source is added to the game, but many items and many loot pools were tweaked or significantly altered over the course of vanilla. In these cases the content will release as it originally did and be updated on a similar schedule to vanilla. So loot won’t be 1.12 at release either.
---
There might be some QOL tweaks and stability updates and stuff that were live by 1.12 that they’ve chosen to include from day one of Classic. So perhaps you could say the game engine is 1.12, even though the content is not. 
---
And then there’s the classes themselves. Talent trees and stat distributions and abilities all had balance tweaks and adjustments over the course of vanilla. So in these cases will they be using 1.12 values on day one?
---
Is that all correct? Close? Either way I regularly hear ppl referring to day one as 1.12 and that seems objectively inaccurate.
---
Came here to say this. Skarm has been pumping out some good content, was excited to see this one.
---
When was this exactly?
---
I just bought the remastered version on the steam sale for 4 euros. 
---
Last time i played DS1 i gave up in the bed of chaos area, looking forward to actually beating the game this time around.
---
That's because you edited your question after being proven wrong.
---
I ain’t tellin you guys yet
---
Found it on here somewhere lol I'll try to dig it up for ya
---
I did not know but at the same time im not surprised if there is one thing that disney does not do its fuck around (unless its with aquired IPs)
---
It's pretty clear what's going on, no matter what we say, no matter how impassioned out voices become, Blizzard will not listen. Why? Simply because they don't want to spend the money on multiple language based servers on launch day, in the slim chance that Classic isn't as popular as we all wish it to be.
---
In a year after launch, if the popularity of Classic holds at a respectable, and profitable, level then Blizzard might add language specific servers, but until that point, we're SOL.
---
And yeah, joining a random server on launch and 3 months later finding out it's majority French speaking while my character is level 60 with pre-raid gear and maxed out professions would absolutely kill any desire to keep playing, it's one of main reasons I'm even hesitant do play at launch and to wait an extra week or so to see where the winds are blowing, fucking sucks man.
---
Can Bloodsail Buccaneers really be considered Neutral though? How do you actually get a friendly rep with them?
---
Want a creepy undercity one for all us walking corpses
---
Using your logic Classic should have been here years ago because the demand has always been there. It may blow your mind but sometimes higher-up don't see the potential. You know, just as was the case with Classic WoW.
---
For every one of those big complained about beta things in BFA/Legion/WoD/MoP/Cata that went live, dozens did get fixed and were immediately forgotten about.
---
Genius idea, 
---
It'd be kind of cool if they alliance version featured them doing OP's idea but also fighting a group of Horde Rogues at some point that would drop a quest giving item, when Horde run the dungeon they fight a group of Alliance engineers or something.

---
Oh, thanks
---
As low as feasible to result in the fairest result possible.
---
There, easy as fuck to prove.
---
Also by the way, frame and input are not the same.
---
I edited out a grammatical error the question is literally the exact same.  
---
I did not ask "what game is possibly bigger than WoW".
---
I mean just for basic leveling questing its definitely still doable
---
I've actually been enjoying BFA for what it is. Like, knowing that we are getting a more hardcore RPG experience with classic has made me appreciate and accept what BFA is more as weird as that may sound.
---
What if the bug was not in for most of vanilla but only 1.11-1.12?
---
Is that how it started? And it was definitely not mostly VC in the US. I never saw VC on any of the 3 or 4 servers I had character on until Naxx was already out.
---
Taurens got the big ass shoulders
---
But layering is not a long term solution that will persist for longer than absolutely necessary.
---
Camp those neuts until they despwan!
---
Magram gang
---
I agree with your sentiment, but this statement of yours is very insulting to the intelligence and capability of the devs and really just unfair imo:
---
&gt;The only way blizzard will make changes is based on player feedback and outrage, we have countless examples now.
---
Renew ticks generate threat. If the tank pulls with a weapon, you're getting threat on the mobs he hasn't touched.
---
And now his threat generation is gimped because of the shield.
---
I don't pull while renew is ticking and I manually remove shields. If I was 100% health, I'd wait for your mana.
---
what if it was a bug that was NOT part of most of vanilla but got introduced in 1.11
---
I care more about him being a fraud about WoW than the entire construction company thing. My dad use to work no show construction jobs in the nyc union and got paid like 120 an hour to sit around and eat in the 80s.
---
I like it. I much prefer something natural and off the cuff where people can speak honestly than an awkward environment where there are pauses when people are trying to affect a facade.
---
This is my first time listening and it was good just hearing people who know their stuff casually shooting the shit about WoW. I have no idea why anyone would have an issue.
---
Same.. just found a classic box plus manuals, cds, and sleeves in great condition on ebay for $12. Sadly I threw my originals out looooong ago.
---
Now to find a custom framer...
---
It wouldn't open the loot window no, but if you there's 5 mobs on top of each other, you would constantly just click on a dead mob, instead of actually looting the one that isn't looted yet.
---
It's a strawman because the big private servers already said they were going to shutdown. He's saying these ''nefarious'' server owners are going to try everything in their power to maintain their playerbase away from Blizzard's Classic WoW trying to portray them as some greedy money sucking people for no reason at all to paint them in a negative light. trying to make them into a strawman that doesn't exist.
---
where is this confirmed? thanks
---
It's their favotire lunch able that got discontinued but now only comes with water instead a capri sun so they get angry and want the capri sun's back
---
Beta has been live for 41 days. There are, at a minimum, 35 days of beta remaining. Get a grip.
---
Doesn't matter if you use it to trap or not, the DR will be applied on both spells, and in any duel scenario against a class that tries to tank ur burst, you will very quickly reach the immunity to cc's.
---
&gt; As low as feasible to result in the fairest possible outcome.
---
You're pretty new to this whole objectivity thing aren't you...
---
You need to define all of these things so there's zero room for ambiguity, *and then prove that it's the best way of doing things*.
---
I had a buddy that fucked an older woman who also played WoW. She paid for his subscription in exchange.
---
That’s pretty much what I’m going for. Thanks for listening to the show Bucky, appreciate it.
---
I saw a streamer unable to group with someone because of this delay. He thought it was busted and kept logging off to "fix it."
---
I feel there needs to be clear feedback to the user to make it obvious why your standing on your party member but can't do anything with them for a period of time.... This is a compromise from what I knew as vanilla, but maybe it just has to be that way....
---
I don’t really understand what this post means but I guess I’m a vulture now
---
Seriously, running across the Karanas was a day long affair, hah.
---
these are the top two classes for me too. I plan to roll them both at launch and level them in parallel (switch between them when I'm feeling bored of one). Can't go wrong. Both classes are viable in all categories.
---
When will you learn that subbreddit comment sections aren't actually that important, and to stop taking this so seriously? It's not like we didn't raise hell during the BfA beta. the Feedback was there, the anger was there, the constant stream of posts about it were there. There is feedback, and then there is whining. The whining will not actually trigger a company to act. Either they are going to act on feedback, or they just aren't going to.
---
Can google “countdown to classic warlock” and you’ll get to the video, can also confirm that machine gun imp works in beta :)
---
Alchemy will never be useless.
---
Most guilds really really badly want 3 warlocks for the strong debuffs they provide, and especially if you are ally warlocks are rather rare.
---
Warlocks are sadly trash tier dps until bwl is out. 16% spell miss is brutal, and you are the hardest scaling spellcaster so when gear is weak, you are weak. Warlocks require full bwl + zg gear to finally start competing.
---
Rogues are essentially the number 2 dps throughout the game until either a strong warlock or mage crew starts beating em. This requires flasking, and a geared class group because you rely on your fellow casters for either improved shadowbolt for warlock, or ignite for mages. Rogue is strong in a vacuum, you just rely on proper debuffs which the majority of guilds do these days.
---
sir, i believe you have mistakenly responded to the OP of the thread
---
Stop lying.
---
You asked what BR or survival games would even come close to the size of WoW.
---
Found the retail player I guess...
---
Do you also curse how warriors get the whirlwind axe? How about Paladin and Warlock mounts? Blizzard must surely be playing favourites.
---
Not everything has to be homogenous. Not everything has to be equal. 
---
Hell, it's honestly super unfair how only rogues and druids get stealth. Talk about playing favourites.
---
It's like a sequel to Fifty Shades
---
Dude you made me lol
---
Um... If it wasn't triggered by specific actions people could still abuse it like they are now for things like double looting Gurabashi chest etc and then there would be no reason to even implement a CD in the first place lol.
---
Layering is based on CRZ, but its purpose is not the same and it has significant changes in behavior and intent. Most significantly, layering is a temporary solution that's going to be removed at some point.
---
I figured one reason i too felt like this is because i was playing on a potato with rendering distance on lowest. Since you never saw your destination before arriving the walks and the world felt much bigger.
---
I'm afraid the max efficiency state of mind is going to take its toll on this the same it has on old school RuneScape.. noone does anything that isn't max exp. All the minigames are dead. Noone just having fun..  we grew up and don't have time for fun I guess.
---
Human warlocks are top tier if arena pvp ever becomes a thing. Wotf will be annoying but not a dealbreaker.
---
I don't even get what you're saying here... Are you saying because you don't care about anything end game or economy related it's fine that game breaking bugs are in the game as long as you aren't actively doing them or something? It's just abusing unintended game mechanics plain and simple and needs to be resolved before launch.
---
Oh hell nah! It's on brother.
---
Nobody uses arcane potions for skeram. That boss is a cake walk. Guilds that never killed nef could kill skeram even without potions.

&gt; If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
&gt; **To align with other regions, the Americas character creation will occur slightly ahead of August 13
---
Alright thanks very much! If you could take only one. herb or mining?
---
What the fuck is "whining"? The people point to a problem. An arbitrary, subjective word you chose to call it doesn't mean anything. Literally any thread on this subreddit about layering that was upvoted and visible was provided with argumentation. 
---
What YOU choose to call "whining" or any other stupid word means nothing.
---
Welcome to reddit. You can't hurt people feeling or you get downvoted to hell.
---
Now people are acting like this is the perfect change that totally fix layering(which isn't at all).
---
In a few weeks when video pops up showing that this is just as bad they will start complaining again.
---
I'm not lying at all.  It was a literal grammatical error.  In any case, how many of these are survival games?
---
$800,000 worth, apparently.
---
Thanks so much for the advice. I have been looking seriously at druid shaman and priest. Druid I love the versatility of being able to play hotw NS and be able to do multiple things with just gear changes, but Im worried about not having an ooc rez and mana stability. Shaman, I like that it has an offensive dispel and is generally a pretty aggressive healer, but Im worried about not having a dispel for my warrior. And priest the only thing Im worried about is a complete lack of mobility. My warrior will peel if I ask for it but she's not always the most situationally aware, so things like rogues kind of make me worried about playing priest.
---
Rejoice! Love, love, love hearing from the AWS guy.  I'm a developer and use AWS heavily.  Everything he said was stuff I've been trying to convey to people.
---
Fine with me
---
This absolutely amazing, saving this for sure!
---
You are seeing a lot of conflict in this thread because  people are getting tripped up in the difference between *viable* and *efficient* triple druid is not at all efficient … you would go much faster with all kinds of set ups and people are excited to let you know, but ultimately, what you are looking to do *is possible*
---
If they do release TBC, I want them to turn the raids into 40 man raids.  When they dropped them to 25, I lost interest in PvE and almost exclusively turned into a PvP player.
---
Is there any sort of lore series like that without the later retcons? like classic era lore?
---
I'll ask again after you've spent 4 hours in capital city spamming LF1M tank
---
It is the **fairest** way of doing things, there is zero ambiguity in that. Fair would mean if you press first, you act first. The way to achieve that is to make the batching ms as low as is feasible.
---
Do you really require hard evidence to prove that players acting in the order of when they acted to the best degree that's feasible is fair? 
---
As I said, this is why retail is 20ms.
---
Thanks for the response. My plan is to tank our dungeon runs while leveling and I feel like either druid or warrior are fine for that. I have a feeling I will be tired of classic by the time I hit 60 and it's time to raid.
---
It's Aspect of the Pack when it's for everyone. And it's the worst fucking thing ever. The only time I've actually used it is when I have to go back to the entrance in WC and show some noob how to get back to the group. Or when traversing the Barrens because obviously.
---
And the worst part is that... okay so it only has like a ten yard radius or something, so if I outrun them then they fall behind and won't catch up. But because they're fucking idiots they don't pay attention when I explain that, and they inevitably fall behind because they stopped to look at a leaf or something.
---
That's not the worst part. The worst part is that when I stop to let them catch up, THEY STOP TOO. It's so goddamn infuriating to watch them, their sloped foreheads tilted in confusion as spittle drips from their slackened lips, repeatedly stopping instead of catching up to me. The entire goddamn point of me escorting them is to save time and because they are inbred illiterates they're wasting time instead.
---
I swear to God it's like actually reading group chat is a goddamn superpower. FOLLOW SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS ASSHOLES
---
Leeway is not spellbatching though.
---
Drink more caffeine and push it to the limit as i begin to feel my legs cramp and my head buzz, turning into another 5 hours of brutal questing.
---
You're looking at it from the wrong end. More players=more layers, now you're a normal player not abusing this bug. You just got way more competition than is intended for the nodes/rare spawns/etc you're trying to farm. People constantly are layer swapping to grab more of the resource while you're sitting there dealing with the 4+ (afaik a definitely spawn time for black lotus wasn't ever landed on and private servers just kinda made it up like a lot of other stuff they weren't privy to) respawn timer on a node while the other player is able to swap between several layers on demand waiting on the 4+ hour respawn timer of dozens of the same spawn at the same time.  This puts the control of the economy into the hands of a few players abusing the mechanics rather than naturally spreading it around to whoever on that server found it first.
---
That was great. Good work mate and happy birthday.
---
Yeah shock is useless most of the time anyway, so i would go that way most likely. BRD arena farm, SM, RFD good alternatives? I don't like open world farm
---
Does anyone have a lore series of write ups or videos without the later retcons? like a "vanilla era" lore setup that goes back to the titans etc, but without the retcons from legion and the like?
---
That does suck. I do remember using other traps than freezing a lot more for this reason. Particularly classes I had to outlast like pallies and druids. 
---
I do think it will effect the meta game, but I don't think it will be game breaking. It will definitely make entrapment a lot more desired talent.
---
It is how I remember it being that in vanilla, so it is hard to want this to be a be a priority, idk. I don't think anyone would have cared about this had private servers not gotten it wrong, though.
---
We're going with 1.12 balance and you could see it as part of class balance. We're also getting the debuff limit back which obviously was just a technical limitation and not intentional, but for balance reasons we get debuff limits in Classic. Same thing should apply to "bugs" that effect classes gameplay.
---
Obviously if there are completely game breaking bugs that should be fixed, this seems like hunters wanting buffs for themselves that were not part of Vanilla.
---
That being said, hunters seem pretty broken and the leeway seems to affect them the most in a negative way so if hunters get a little buff and we call it a bug fix that would not be the end of the world.
---
Yeah I like the synergy between troll priest racials and priest talents. Being able to proc blackout with shadowguard seems great for breaking up rogue stunlocks. And the extra MS seems really nice, does anyone know if troll priest Hex of Weakness stacks with Warrior's Mortal Strike?
---
Well, this is when you can make your character, not when they announce the realm list. Also it doesnt say times. I think your time is a good guess because its the same time the game will release 2 weeks later but it doesn't seem to be confirmed.
---
These are the Classic talent backgrounds for each specialization. They should be mostly in order (grouped with the other talents of their class). I pulled these from classic.wowhead's talent calculator.
---
This sounds like pre old school runescape talk all over again lol.
---
There’s already a case to look into to see what is possible with something like wow classic. Just go back to the osrs subreddit from before launch
---
The converse also applies: don’t post videos highlighting bugs that have already been fixed. I checked the leg behavior about two hours after the initial video was posted, but wasn’t able to post my rebuttal until later that night. It seems most likely it was either an isolated bug or outdated info.
---
Im rolling this alt primarily to duo level with and pocket heal my fiance's warrior, so Im not worried so much about raw dmg as I am utility and pvp capability/survivability.
---
Expect to get rekt by rogues warriors ret pallies enh shaman, feral druids, and anything else that melees. Much more so than usual
---
I don’t know if I’ll have time for two characters because I want to get to 60 fairly quickly. But this is seeming like the only solution for me because I just can’t make up my mind.
---
Watch videos like Reckful 3 and you'll see why people like spell-batching. It makes the game a bit more like a fighting game in PvP because you have tiny windows of opportunity via predictions to outplay your opponent.
---
Stuff like Kicked frost-&gt;Gouge his blink require skill to pull off and if you remove spellbatching the skill-ceiling of the game drops significantly.
---
My alt will be a hunter of the opposite faction but I'm stuck on maining a paladin or shaman lol
---
Scatter didn't share DR for the majority of Vanilla. It was bugged in 1.12, which lasted 3 whole months. Fixing a gamebreaking, unintentional Hunter bug that existed for a single digit percent of Vanilla's lifespan is \*obvious.\*
---
TBc isn’t classic...
---
Holy fuck dude, this quote is an absolute banger. I'm so sick of Alliance running from me in every possible situation. Literally 0 of the 'best players' will fight me in PvP.
---
What if the bug was not part of most of vanilla but only the later patches?
---
Stuck between resto druid and holy pally. Interested in being a tryhard in both pvp and pve. What say ye?
---
Our hands and the flop has been dealt. We haven’t seen the turn or river yet.
---
I did, but the content in this post isn’t really anything new to them. I’m at square one and they’re in the 12 square talking about zone plans and class balance. 
---
I don’t expect much from them.
---
Reminds me of the time I was trying to play this star wars racer game but my computer would only display a black screen and the mini map, so I was playing the game just by looking at the mini map. Gj man
---
Love your videos man! Without doubt rolling dwarf pally, can’t make my mind up between dwarf starting areas up to finishing wetlands or moving over to start human levelling zones at around level 10 or so, fun morogh (spelling?) is amazing
---
I have read other layering debates, that is where I got my "shit". 
---
As to your points I agree. And I think most ppl preferred the layering inconvenience over multiserver. Based on Reddit and official forum responses of course.
---
Whining is not "here's a behavior that feels obstructive, or looks like a bug." Whining is "Oh man I can't believe Blizzard hasn't fixed this yet, I better assume they are incompetent and ignoring this, and just create a bunch of duplicate posts of the exact same report with no further details."
---
I'm also not talking just about what was upvoted. I sort by new sometimes, lol. I also find these comments latched on as replies to upvoted comments. I'm mocking them. They are something to mock.
---
I guess in this situation you're talking about a guy that's raided enough to have waited for every other Hunter to get their gear before he does.... Sounds like everyone will have much better gear than his "free stuff" by that point so whatever... 
---
Moreover I'm not in the camp of giving gear that has a obviously prio class to a hunter b/c he likes it
---
Can't really blame people throwing a shit fit, BFA beta was a mess and there was so much detailed bug reporting and what did we get? 100% radio silence and the game launched like a pile of a shit.
---
Trust is earned not given.
---
How would anyone be able to abuse it if any time you changed layers it would go on CD immediately ? That's my point. If the CD is activated by certain actions you take after changing layers it would still be possible to abuse in it ways that circumvent triggering the CD. Anyone with half a brain should be able to notice that flaw.
---
It's as if Raid lockouts only triggered if you did certain things after killing the boss. It makes no sense. You do the thing you're not supposed to be able to do over and over (switch layer/kill boss) and then it immediately locks you out from doing it again.
---
That WAS my most anticipated game (it and TLOU Part 2) up until about a month ago when I started watching Classic WoW streams.  The nostalgia came rushing back and now nothing can contain my hype for this game.  I've never had more fun playing a game than while raiding end game Vanilla WoW content.
---
I barely remember even after the explanation but yea.
---
With the extend of ho fleshed out they are it's no supise that I forgot, I think
---
And if you're a shitty tank that asking me again after 4 hours i'll say no again and wait on a good tank or a guildy/irl friend to log on. I dont mind new tanks or someone learning but if they are a known shitter... Naw ill wait all day or just not run the dungeon.
---
Hi, /u/northshorebestshore
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5wmq0/what_class_can_carry_pug_battlegrounds/). 
---
This is the type of content I would be okay with them implementing after naxx release.
---
&gt;  It makes the game a bit more like a fighting game in PvP because you have tiny windows of opportunity via predictions to outplay your opponent.
---
A fifth of a second isn't a tiny window. It's not "Outplaying" your opponent if you act AFTER him and manage to simultaneously cast. It's just a shitty abuse of mechanics, it's like saying if I climb the log in Warsong by walljumping I've outplayed other people I'm nuking from there.
---
&gt;Stuff like Kicked frost-&gt;Gouge his blink require skill to pull off.
---
No, they require you to react within a window. Batching LOWERS the skill cap, not increases it. You can and do often get both spells going off by total accident nevermind planned, if you allow people a longer amount of time to react to something than they actually had that's not an increase to skill.
---
It's my understanding that if you loot something you won't be able to change layers until CD goes away.
---
Sure have fun killing mobs 1-2 seconds quicker with 50 more strength than spending 5-7 seconds eating. Alliance - doh makes total sense. Must be 14 and using common core or some shit - cant do math.
---
What the hell are you saying. I am all to keep the DR between trap and scatter shot but it was like this for a so short period of time that you couldn't not remember "hunter werent" that strong. A geared Hunter properly played was really OP. As NE you could cast aimshot while being shadowmeld for like half the duration of Vanilla. Before weapon normalisation and nerf of Mortal shots from 50 to 30% you could crit for 3,5k+ in pvp with a slow weapon and T1/T2 on a daily basis.
---
Concerning OP, "undetected" seriously? how full of yourself are you... we screamed for weeks on forum, they were aware of it and never changed it back. So in the end we  just stopped scatter into trapping, and we deal with it. Bad hunter kept doing it, other just changed tactics.
---
And not all private server removed the DR on trap/SS, i played on some and it was present, so i don't understand the confusion here.
---
That's because layering was presented as a way of bypassing the downsides of sharding but now we have had experience with the system we know that some of those same downsides still exist with layering. We want those downsides gone at least for high level content.
---
DR was present early on, like 1.2, so it was in Vanilla for over 12 months through 10 major patches. There were adjustments to DR over this period but none to scatter/freezing sharing DR.  
---
Hm yes it seems like they just *overlooked* this 'bug', it just completely escaped their notice! Completely unintentional.
---
You are correct, you story MIGHT have not existed with layering; however, mine WILL exist without layering even with multiple realms as ppl will still pick the same realm. Everyone wants to play on Illidan 1 and not 4. Human nature.
---
If it's actually a bug it should be removed. Just doing a little bit of thought experimentation with this and it clearly ridiculous. If somebody found a way to abuse spell batching to dupe gold, we wouldn't say it's 1.12 therefore it has to stay.
---
It's realy a matter of who stays online the longest when it launches. So whoever has the most adderall will win, I guess.
---
None of those things you listed are bugs.
---
Now they’re phone wallpaper
---
You would have to to have an insanely loose definition of "game-breaking" to think that "bug" this is game-breaking. Are you, on your hunter, or is anyone else on any character, not going to not play PvP because of this "bug"? All parties, hunters or non-hunters, will still engage in PvP and have fun.
---
Nothing but facts
---
Dude the only other mmorpgs with pvp elements as heavy as WoW before WoW were basically like rust with more rpg elements and less survival. Everyones gonna stab your back and take your loot at some point. Which is fine in rust but it felt chaotic in a lot of games. WoW was the first mmorpg to bring elements that made things more organized and rpg like in player interaction but you also had all out faction war. There was no room for any quality of life updates other than technical because WoW was already a perfect balance of community with accessibility, and total danger. Any addition of quality of life completely destroys the game. Its why im strictly a classic guy and wont be playing tbc again most likely.
---
Vivid AF metaphor.
---
It was not a bug, i was there, it was intentional. Dunno where this come from.
---
Yes, it is how the world works. Everything you’re saying is justification for poor morality. It’s EASIER to keep your SO around in case this new person isn’t as great as you think, but it isn’t RIGHT. You aren’t describing something “missing” from a relationship, you’re describing “upgrading”. People are not items, and shouldn’t be treated as such. The world certainly isn’t black and white, but pursuing a relationship with someone already in one or dallying with someone while you’re already committed to another are not morally ambiguous problems.
---
&gt;It is the fairest way of doing things, there is zero ambiguity in that.
---
"Fairness" isn't an objective metric, but fine, I can entertain this point for the sake of argument.
---
&gt; The way to achieve that is to make the batching ms as low as is feasible.
---
What *is* "as low as feasible"? Who gets to decide what internet connection speed is the cutoff point? Who gets to decide what hardware specification is the cutoff point? Why shouldn't people who played WoW with dialup in '05 be able to play Classic with that same dialup and have roughly the same experience?
---
&gt;Do you really require hard evidence to prove that players acting in the order of when they acted to the best degree that's feasible is fair? 
---
I require hard evidence to accept an "Objective Argument". You're the one claiming to have objectivity on their side.
---
If you want to continue making subjective arguments, that's fine, just so long as we're clear that the only argument you've brought with you is a highly subjective one based on your sense of good play feel.
---
Amazing
---
But I want the BC expansion :(
---
To be fair, that's kind of what it indicates.  
---
If they were only planning on keeping it for the week of release/for the first few zones, then this wouldn't be a required change.  
---
This suggests they want to keep it for months
---
They had the source code but not the art assets or databases, until they found them on a tape backup of a TBC server that contained a folder that was labelled "1.12 Backup Data"
---
I don't think people are truly informed about the pros and cons of each version to make an opinion, but if tipsout tweet here today about there being a cooldown with layer swapping, that definitely tips the favor to layering.
---
Since when are pve server that huge?
---
Is this because this is retail?
---
Is BDO bigger than Azeroth?
---
Great news! Hopefully this doesn't mean they will want to keep it around though...
---
Though I think a lot of your points are very interesting and deserve thought, I completely disagree with your point 3:
---
&gt;C. Justified by population to have lively servers
---
&gt;Answer putting 5 Int servers will not be enough, EU has way more players than that. They're aiming for 3k stable, are they truly thinking there'll only be 15k EU players overal? Everyone that doesn't speak english will have to migrate once they add more servers to meet the demand.
---
As /u/UbiGeofram nicely comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5qs9h/bringing_attention_to_eu_without_language/es447l3/), there is not only the problem of having ~5 different languages, but also 4 different server types (and people are of course lobbying for each and everyone). It is not hard to imagine that quite a few of them will be in trouble after the initial rush. I imagine it is really hard right now for Blizz to determine the amount of players that will play for a longer time. Having 20 different server types increases this problem twentyfold.
---
&gt;Edit: ALSO, in one server just because there's 3k because of that policy, there'll still be 4-5 communities, playing amongst themselves. In practice, this means this is just a server regrouping 5 little servers of 600 of specific language speakers. Sure the server will look big, but people will still not interact from german to spanish for example, if they're bothered by having to speak english. They'll just regroup and have a small server inside the big official one.
---
Even if there are different communities, they can still do things like dungeons or world events together without necessarily needing to completely understand the others. They are also still walking in the same towns.
---
And aside from that, just for some general consideration - there are loads of multiplayer games. Having specific language server is the exception. There's no German server or matchmaking in Overwatch, League of Legends or CS:GO.
---
LFM DG. Need healer and key.
---
What's DG?
---
DG=Darkmaster Gandling=Scholomance.
---
now these are some good ideas
---
They also don't get furbolg form. Sucks to be inferior, godless mongrels I guess..
---
Gadget. 
---
With your ports you have access to everything in quick time.
---
You mean make half the specs worthless aside from bringing one of a spec to make a completely other class even better? Sounds fun
---
&gt;This is just like asking for hybrid dps rebalancing and changing other tank specs to be comparable to warriors.
---
Fixing an unknown bug that didn't exist for the *vast majority* of Vanilla is the same thing as fundamentally altering the intended balance of classes?
---
A faithful recreation of Vanilla is Vanilla as it was intended to be, not the frozen state of a 3-month version of the game. If Reckoning was bugged in 1.12 but never caught, I guess we should just leave in too or else that might open the gates for crazy shit like Balance Druid viability, after all.
---
&gt;IQ across different Racial groups in the Alliance: Gnomes have an average IQ of 85, Humans of 103, Dwarves 106 and Night Elves 113.
---
Is this before or after the int racial for gnomes?
---
I have to second, this. He said "the bug was undected during vanilla", like wtf we yelled about the nerf on forum and we just adapted to a new meta. Scatter into trapping became a beginner mistake past this nerf, is something i remember clearly.
---
Holy Paladin. 
---
You'll be hard to kill in pvp and you're a dedicated tank healer. IIRC, you'll be a better healer than the druid could be.
---
And how does that address anything that doesn't involve looting stuff ? Again, why would you attach the CD to other specific actions when you can just attach it the action of changing layers ?
---
Hrrrrgh u/Gemall , the tauren druid is trying sneak around but he's dummy thicc and the clap from his hooves keep alerting the guards!
---
Good overview! Horde all day for me, even though NE cat form looks so much better
---
But that's what engi is for.
---
Blizzard has banned people for going underneath Karazhan. That doesn’t mean it’s a high priority fix, as only a tiny minority of the player base ever goes there. The same applies in WSG. Most people don’t roofwalk, so it isn’t at the top of the list. That doesn’t mean it’s intended game behavior, and it doesn’t mean it should be left in.
---
Gnome the inventors ruled by their best scientists and developer of all the technology that the alliance uses to win 
---
&gt;Gnomes have an average IQ of 85
---
:thinking:
---
its not an english but an international server.
---
&gt;I'm just glad it is established that this is how it was in vanilla. People have been telling me I'm wrong about that for years
---
You are wrong, and it didn't work like this in Vanilla. It worked like this in Patch 1.11 and Patch 1.12. It was a bug that was introduced before TBC and which did not exist for most of the lifespan of Vanilla.
---
Diminishing returns were added to freezing trap in 1.10. It was there for 1.10-1.12 then removed in tbc.
---
Hunter has so many bugs on beta and now this, I'm really asking myself everyday if I want to roll one.
---
Thanks for this
---
I obviously wouldn't renew on a LoS pull... Dungeons take a long time. There is a balance between downtime/getting out of there at a reasonable pace. The situation I described is one I used a million times and keeps the party moving. I think you missed the point of my comment which is that there are situations where I preemptively shielded and renewed and it worked just fine. Besides the loss of rage from shield is so minor especially when you have 30 rage from previous pull
---
I always thought that terrain abuse is a retarded concept, just fix the damn game. Same like mages blinking up GY...
---
Patch 1.12, 1.11, and 1.10 were vanilla, so suck IT I'm right.
---
To be fair...
---
That last one sounds like what I'd pull after raids on my mage. Good old portal roulette or even the mole machine. It's amazing how many people will go, 'Oh wow I need to click on this big drill!'. Never was kicked, but some guildies would get pissed being stuck in Stonard.
---
Assasins creed Odyssey. Been loving it so far. Though there has been Stellaris, Rimworld and cities ckylines.
---
Because you could log on, loot chest/kill rare etc, change layer and then potentially loot/kill again. I don't understand what you're not understanding about that.
---
I know lol. I'm hoping you can tell me which of these makes you travel. I love big open world games like that. Trying to find a good one to play until WoW.
---
Either that or they want it to work well and not be abused in while it is up.. which is ideal
---
watchout watchout watchou COW STOMP outta nowhere!!! Everybodys stunned, run!!
---
Oh hey fellow Rogue
---
&gt; Fairness" isn't an objective metric
---
Of course it is. 
---
You're talking about a live action game where one person can act first, but have the execution resolved simultaneously. That's objectively not fair, you're quite literally allowing the slower player advantages.
---
&gt;What is "as low as feasible"? Who gets to decide what internet connection speed is the cutoff point? Who gets to decide what hardware specification is the cutoff point? Why shouldn't people who played WoW with dialup in '05 be able to play Classic with that same dialup and have roughly the same experience?
---
The company doing feasibility tests and running the hardware decides that, and as I have pointed out twice, their conclusion was 20ms. Which is TEN TIMES less than the current point.
---
&gt;Why shouldn't people who played WoW with dialup in '05 be able to play Classic with that same dialup and have roughly the same experience?
---
It's not '05. Completely loaded and redundant question. 
---
&gt;If you want to continue making subjective arguments, that's fine, just so long as we're clear that the only argument you've brought with you is a highly subjective one based on your sense of good play feel.
---
Bollocks of the highest order. What is fair in regards to your button presses as closely matching reality as is possible is objective. Has fuck all to do with sense of feel good.
---
Oops sorry. I can’t read lol
---
Glad you posted this. If it was a bug that was only there for 3 out of the total patches (1.10-1.12),  I say fix it.
---
Yeah, the only other game just about that tried to get this feeling in co op gameplay was left 4 dead.
---
I used to have clutch ability before my main spec was removed from the game, that was the advantage of being sturdier as a damage dealer. The gladiator spec held a similar feeling, just in the opposite way by being the tanking designated role with a stance for not tanking. Now all deleted along with dark apotheosis.
---
ever since these co op experiences I've wondered if any game was ever going to iterate on it, and introduce co op gameplay increasingly focused on Control and Support as roles everyone needed to learn and perform. so that instead of just the positioning and movement around the encounter, the whole group might have to react quickly to heavy attacks temporarily knocking the frontline down - in other words an almost hot potato like trade between frontline and backline. We all remember those moments where EVERYONE tried to throw down a burn down phase like for Vael. I wanted to see more mechanics that would challenge the group's communication, coordination, and innovation under fire. In essence the concept of clutching becoming the central means to succeed in combat. 
---
They were on to something in the design of the heroic encounters in burning crusade, and despite the fact that this kind of co op play borders on being too similar to just asking the whole group to participate in the whack a mole aesthetic that healers live and breathe, the feeling of MASTERING the zul aman speed run to earn war bear for our entire team was I think the pinnacle of awesome design for this kind of depth in the group combat gameplay the game ever saw.
---
I loved portal roulette.  We usually did that when the raid was over.
---
Leeway and spell batching are related systems, both dealing with managing lag. Changes to one necessitates changes to the other
---
Great post for this sub. Eat upvotes.
---
\&gt;   so suck it I'm right. 
---
Lovely.
---
You're still wrong, because Vanilla is not 1.12, 1.11, or a single patch. Get over it.
---
I’m trying to decide between a Warrior and a Shaman. I have a leveling buddy for the first 8 days of classic, we are going to duo. If I pick Warrior, he’ll pick Priest, if I pick Shaman, he’ll pick Mage. Both combos are good but my heart says play the Shaman for nostalgia, my head says Warrior since tanking in vanilla is great and you will be sought after. I am really not sure which to do.
---
&gt; So the world won’t be 1.12 at release. 
---
It was already 1.13 at the last Blizzcon demo when Classic was announced.
---
Cheers man! :D
---
[We think this approach will give players more freedom to move around to where they want, and find guilds and friends that best match their interests.](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-european-realms-structure/56694)
---
Rerolling from a German realm to an English is no different then rerolling from one international realm to another. The only way this sentence makes sense is if they plan on only releasing 3 realms. 1 PvP, 1 PvE and 1 RP. That would also explain why they don't want to do a RP-PvP.
---
&gt; This suggests they want to keep it for months
---
That's what I'm scared too.
---
This is big enough for people to avoid playing hunters or pvping on hunters yes.
---
Twitch marketing phase? Maybe that's too wordy.  
---
Oh i see, that explains everything.. you are horde!! hehe. I really hope you are right...! ^^
---
Oh please.
---
Kid got SHIT ON
---
Who's angry? This is all factual. Just like yall are tired of hearing everyone bitch about Classic, i'm tired of listening to Blizz ball fondlers saying everything is just fine while ignoring 5 years of proof.
---
You are a moron. 
---
Me: "Hey, there is yellow on the road" **points at yellow stripe in road**
---
You: "akchtually, the entire road isn't yellow, so no. There is no yellow in the road"
---
It's been said already a lot, but there isn't anything to abuse if layering is only kept for a few days.
---
If people want to layer hop to farm copper ore veins I don't think anybody would care, and world PVP doesn't kick in until 15-20 at the very earliest
---
I wonder what the  next topic will be for all the hyped up goons to froth at the mouth over.
---
Thanks Wayner!
---
Warriors - They are almost designed to be ***the*** tank of the game. You'll have most if not all of your tanking abilities at level 10. You have a tree dedicated solely to tanking and it does a good job at getting you there. 
---
Druid - You get everything you need to tank at level 10 (after you do your bear quest), but it won't be as good as the warrior. The druid's draw is that it can do all these other things too, so you only get a "dip" into each role. 
---
This means, as the user above stated, that you have to ***do more*** for sometimes less results. For example, before you do that pull, you better throw Regrowth on yourself and then go into bear form, otherwise you'll be capped on mana. 
---
But overall your ability to defend yourself and reduce damage taken is non-existent. 
---
Paladin - Thought I would mention since it is also a tank. You ***don't*** get everything you need to tank at level 10. In fact, you pretty much can barely tank at all until you get Consecration at level 20, but that's only after you put 11 points into Holy. This will allow you to pick up more than one mob because you do not have an AoE ability ***at all***. 
---
You are also not given a taunt. Ever. 
---
You also do not get any damage reduction abilities until you go 31pts into Prot. 
---
I can't think of any reason why Paladin's are this unrefined, other than the fact that, this was Vanilla, lots of shit wasn't refined.
---
OMG AMAZING!
---
You had to kill a named dragon for the Onyxia Questchain there.
---
Also phase 2 when someone lands at a 48+ flight point
---
I honestly can’t tell you because she’s actually my gf and some guys just copied my message.
---
I see what you did there, Brother.
---
Man I love that kinda of stuff. Makes the game feel like a real world, quite immersive.
---
Can't wait to decide a class to play to do all this haha. Maybe an Enhancement Shaman or maybe Mage, or Rogue... hahahaha no idea and I'm loving this.
---
&gt; It's Aspect of the Pack when it's for everyone
---
Ah thanks, I couldn't remember the proper name. Or maybe my brain forgot it to prevent PTSD. :^)
---
#FUCK the Wintersaber trainers.
---
It might be best that they don't release the exact numbers and its randomly generated to actually combat the problems that it is trying to address.
---
QQ
---
Your entire basis of wanting this change is that it's a "bug" from vanilla. A bug is something in the game that was not intended by the developers. How do you prove that it was or wasn't intended by the developers? Maybe the developers, when they were working on vanilla, thought hunters would be too powerful if these were not on one DR. They might've been wrong, but that would still make it intentional.
---
And then, even if it was a bug, that opens pandora's box, but that's beating a dead horse.
---
The problem is there will be so many bad tanks who just want to smash execute in raids and are only tanking until they get pre raid BiS. There won't be an ignore list long enough. Also generally you can't tell until you make your group travel out there and start chain wiping. Then you gotta hearth back to spam the active lfg channel or annoy people in trade. There is no escape from the bads
---
It's an extended part that actually got cut out which is ashame because it's really beautiful. An open field with obelisk and sand waterfalls
---
Play something new. Take on that challange of being the tank and basically be the leader. Take it by the horns g!
---
Then you aren't using dkp if you won't let a hunter roll on it because you think it's not good for him, reason I used the hunter example is because there's usually only 2 or 3 hunters in a raid so they get geared quickly
---
If it was a fast run I'd wait for your mana to get around 40% before pulling. I'd remove the shield and renew before the pull.
---
Might be horde going there to gather intel or something or as the others said as merc's and seal the info to the goblins.
---
&gt; My hesitation with Lock is they don't really start becoming a beast until AQ is released,
---
No way! Warlocks are strong right out the gates. It is one of the only classes that I've played that faceroll quests and content at the start of level 1. 
---
Nearly every other class I've leveled in beta so far has had a small ramp up period where it was quite difficult to reduce downtime and handle "bad luck" situations. 
---
Not so with the warlock.
---
I remember it being an april fools joke. Maybe that's what you're thinking of?
---
I think a lot of people are going to be dumbfounded by the speed of vanilla. Me and 2 friends have taken a week off to play. Me and 1 other started in wotlk but the other didn't start until quite a bit later. Me and my wotlk friend have played a good bit on vanilla servers but the other still hasn't. He's expecting to be 60 by the end of that week... We keep telling him very very people will be 60 in a week and we certainly don't fit the criteria for those people.
---
What classes can best carry teams in battlegrounds? I imagine a Druid can carry WSG games but isn’t that useful in the other zones. Healers are great for pugs unless your dps is garbage. Then you are just delaying the inevitable. So which class will allow me to change the tide of war?
---
Yea, I do not know what OP is talking about. When I made a Tauren and had to run from Mulgore's BloodHoof Village all the way to the xroads it took 10 minutes. The world felt freaking massive and I had forgotten how big it used to be.
---
How could we make characters without realms lists?
---
\&gt;  You are a moron. 
---
Truly, I am among greatness.
---
Official ascension server would make me so happy.
---
Would love to see what WoW would be like if they had a "do over" with classic design philosophies or added new content to classic. Good stuff!
---
I cant remember those spells you are talking of.
---
Icelance was the only spell i remember of that category and it was a really cool one since it just really hurt when you were frozen and made shatter combos super satisfactory.
---
Warlock didnt get any, shaman didnt get any, druid didnt get any..
---
Same for mobility. The only class with higher mobility that i remember were rogues with shadowstep.
---
Stupid spells which gave mobility or knockback were mostly introduced with Wotlk.
---
&gt; Will tremor totem and WOTF make my life hell?
---
It might. 
---
For WOTF, just cast Fear twice in a row.
---
For Tremor Totem, just kill the totem with your pet. It has like zero hp.
---
So I just browsed a bit of reddit and came across this post. Post seems legit, and then i read this
---
&gt;  and I think they want to start playing World of Warcraft in August
---
While we don't know for sure, it's pretty likely they will want to play WoW Classic when it comes out. Just thought it was funny that I randomly came across that, and it's for sure awesome to see this :)
---
I think this just depends of the server, and I felt exactly the same except I was on alliance side on my server
---
Of this list, I've only enjoyed Wildlands and the two Assassin's Creed games. Most of them I've never touched. The Witcher 3 and games like it (Skyrim, Fallout, etc) are not for me - they're much too lonely.
---
I enjoyed Wildlands so much, I'll probably be taking a break from WoW when the next one releases on October 4th. We won't even be in Phase 2 then and Phase 3 isn't likely until after the new year.
---
If you do pick up Wildlands, there's /r/WildlandsLFG/ to find a group of people dedicated to playing through together. I've been thinking of doing it myself and going through on the hardest difficulty.
---
What the fuck does that have to do with his opinions on Wow or gamers?
---
Idk I mained healer and had a raid geared OT in vanilla never struggled with threat so much I had to take off renew.

Thanks. I never played paladin in vanilla only in BC and since the group will all be horde I won't be playing it anyways.  
---
"But overall your ability to defend yourself and reduce damage taken is non-existent"
---
Oof that's rough. I'm thinking warrior is just the way to go.
---
Also, Druids had a neutral place...
---
I'm torn between Druid, Shaman, Priest. I really enjoy healing and love the dynamic that support classes bring to a group in both PvP and PvE, but also want to play a class that isn't totally boned in the open world (i.e whilst farming or in a wPvP encounter). I will likely PvP more than PvE but plan to do both. I value versatility and don't want to be pigeonholed into one specific build in PvP or PvE.
---
Priests have a really nice healing kit and Mind Control &lt;3 and Druids and Shamans have such convenient and interesting quality of life abilities but I'm not sure about the requirement of carrying around several gear sets for different roles/specs.
---
The abusers will know how within a week
---
I never said that people wouldn't not pick hunter as their class because of this. I'm saying that people who do choose to play hunter can still PvP and enjoy the game despite this "bug" (if you can even call it that) being in the game.
---
I mean, it's fair in the sense that layering should only really be there for launch day and then be disabled, but I have a feeling it'll last longer than that. Might as well fix it in that case.
---
Renew interferes with weapon pulls.
---
Vanilla is nothing like Retail was, especially after Wrath. 
---
Hybrids were best as healers and all of their dps specs were subpar or unworkable. 
---
Elemental is no exception. You'll have mana problems, and no real way to "absorb" damage or being focused. You have no way to get away either. 
---
If you are going shaman, you need to be OK with healing because that is what you will be doing primarily, or at least, that's the best spec for that class by far.
---
If we can go back in time and Blizzard is Blizzard from 2005. Otherwise, it won't work the same.
---
Yeah, stuff like that is why I will be 100% playing on classic PvE servers. I don't have time to waste doing unnecessary runbacks.

To go with my recent post of the talent backgrounds (https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5wk40/all_classic_wow_talent_backgrounds_album/) I would also like to show the discord pins that I have been working on. These are used in my discord as jump-to buttons in the pin menu, but I think they could also be used as forum signatures. Do with them what you will.
---
How?
---
Exactly! If it is a severe enough bug it should not stay. I would say it is, but only affect hunters in contrast to your gold dupe example. As a thought experiment: Personally i would rather have scatter and trap not share DR than have infinite gold.
---
Uh... like....?
---
So they are somehow going to let you create your characters without there being servers yet?
---
I would argue the exact opposite. you take the AXE because you DON'T have axe skill leveled up.
---
when you finish dead tooth jack, you are over in eastvale at level 10, and probably want to run to westfall. Which means you are running through a low level zone, and that is the perfect time to catch up on a non leveled weapon skill, as you run through low level mobs swinging at them. 
---
Beyond that, axes are very good to have leveled as an alliance as rogues cannot use em and therefore will not roll need on them. (even though this is a solo guide, I just find the idea of leveling a warrior so alien). 
---
It's also just the highest dps weapon in general, which is just best. The herioc strike advantage of a fast weapon is small beans. The real advantage is with slow weapons: even if hamstring kiting is not a thing in the beta, All weapons get their first attack instantly, with no swing timer. In low level, short fights, would you rather have 2.7. seconds of stored up damage in everry fight? or 2.1? 0.6 seconds on a 15 second fight is like 4% of every fight, for free. That's a lot more than slight rage savings on heroic strikes. 
---
I find this entire conversation kind of funny though. find 3 alliance warriors? get 3 opinions.
---
It's not a game breaking bug if Blizzard **purposely** implemented it this way. Though players can be justified to think it's annoying and frustrating.  
---
Layering should not affect the economy because it's ECON100 with supply and demand (unless they screw up layering population). Resources like Black Lotus and others like it however are a exception as layering do affect their unique game mechanic and need to be investigated.  
---
Gurubashi Arena Chest, is a example of a special game mechanic that is indeed not working as intended due to layering affecting it's unique game mechanic. There's a incredible easy fix off the top of my head and need to be investigated.  
---
World PvP is definitely one that layering is affecting, and there's a easy fix off the top of my head and need to be investigated.  
---
Otherwise, for everything else, layering will only give me a positive launch experience.
---
It would be great if you could try to publish to other players what server is going to be the unofficial german server before launch, so people wouldnt accidentally go there if theyre looking for an english server! :)
---
I’m a high school soccer coach and former high school multi sport athlete. I never played football, but I will be playing Classic extensively.
---
A couple of my best friends made all-conference/all-state in football and they were the best WoW players I knew in RL.
---
I agree with everything you said. I guess I should have clarified that I'm really only looking at level 60 and not worried about leveling. Know its a grind and happy to do it whether it is easy or hard.
---
Can we seriously move on? Who really is so lacking in mental stimulation in real life that they care this much?
---
Too low res even for my phone.
---
Human - Perception is ***broken*** for pvp against other rogues. 
---
Mace and Sword Spec. will help with PvE content and Human spirit helps with downtime to some degree. 
---
Gnome - Escape Artist is nice for pvp, but that's about it really. Most of what the gnome offers doesn't really help you as a rogue.
---
Dwarf - Stoneskin is nice to have against Rogues in pvp situational in pve. 
---
Nelf - So really Shadowmeld is the only thing that helps, and it does help you with stealth actually. However the Dwarf and really the Nelf racial are all "defensive". They help you not get caught / if you are caught. 
---
But Human wins out by far IMO. Popping perception will give you a massive advantage when fighting rogues. It's really truly broken af.
---
But its basically alliance instance?
---
No duh. Which is why I stated I wouldn't use renew is that situation. But it sounds like you are thinking about a certain situation where I am trying to say not every situation is the same...
---
Whatever you like, I think. But here's what I think:
---
The +5 crit is great. But what else is in that tree? Piercing Howl might be good. Death wish maybe. But you're spending a lot of points to get down there. 
---
Leveling a warrior completely sucks until at least the high 30s. With improved overpower, at least you have a button you can hit every once in a while. It'll proc deep wounds too.
---
I hate playing without tactical mastery. It's like playing a different class (one that sucks more).
---
Sweeping strikes is good. 2H spec is good. Impale is good. Deep wounds is good. Parry is good. Axe/Sword spec is good.
---
Flurry is good, but now you're in the 30s.
---
MS hits significantly harder than bloodthirst at low gear levels. Whirlwind and overpower and sweeping strikes and deep wounds all hit harder with a 2H. Plus 2H is better in a pvp situation.
---
I spent a lot of time as 2H fury in vanilla (because I had a TUF, and figured I wasn't losing much). Intercept and deathwish are nice. Flurry is great. I can dig it. But I think the case for arms leveling is stronger. 
---
With that said, if you like dual wielding, go for it. My wife was like that. I think different people just like different things -- it's fine.
---
Yahhh lets make up a definition to support your argument of nitpicking on a choice of words instead of actually contributing to the dicussion.
---
Who's ready for that Wintersaber farm
---
&gt; I have no idea why anyone would have an issue.
---
I think it's a similar reason why posts that add to the discussion get downvoted by disagreers.
---
Every situation is the same, don't shield the tank pre-pull.
---
Well each class has its pros and cons I suppose at 60. You’re valuable either which way for the group your with.
---
Because what draws me to RPG's is the story we tell by playing them. To say "I totally held down Kurzen's Compound, Alliance just started avoiding the area" is a better story than "I sorta held down Kurzen's Compound, but really it was just one of several dimensions. People in the other dimensions didn't even know I was there." It also robs those other-layered Alliance, in this hypothetical, of later encountering the same undead rogue and saying, "that damn guy, I remember him from Stranglethorn Vale!" 
---
So layering makes for bad storytelling, but beyond that: if it is continent-wide, it is also excessive by design. There will be a time when there are only a handful of people to have reached Eastern Plaguelands and they can't all see each other due to the order they logged in. Dynamic respawns, by contrast, is always suited the time and place.
---
Why did you write any of that nonsense to essentially say nothing?
---
Shadow priest and Rogue. That mind control can work so perfect on a cliff. They're high damage spells are mage worthy and Rogues well YOU get to decide how the combat is gonna go so they're cant be more power than that.
---
It's a dungeon in Cataclysm.[](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Grim_Batol)
---
Came from playing Runescape and being 12 years old i rolled an undead rogue. One of the beginning quests you can choose mail pants. (obviously they logo was filled over with red) Thinking I just scored dragon pants I picked them. Sadly learned that day about class itemization.
---
Low res is what makes it perfect. I always use low res images for my phones wallpaper. Gives it the out of focus look so it’s easier to see your apps and what not.
---
Not really it's just the same word but like in English same words have different meaning depending on context.
---
We didn't go straight to the bread when watching Harry Potter. But I see how it could be funny for non native speakers though.
---
My pleasure!
---
You said that it sometimes was a bit dull in your previous trio. It should be pointed out that the instances must have been tuned down in tbc. I found it easier to 2man all vanilla dungeons in tbc (did it with Hunter+shaman and also paladin+priest) than it was to 3man them in vanilla. We were better players by then but that couldnt explain it all.
---
And anyone but a druid got ganked hard by the guards there, didn’t they?
---
[It's a dungeon in Cataclysm.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Grim_Batol)
---
To try and say what the other guy was getting at, in different words:
---
Heroic strike is your weapon damage plus a flat amount, but because it replaces an autoattack, You heroic strike harder with a slower weapon but you also lose more damage from forfeiting your autoattack.
---
Because your weapon damage is the same for both actions (autoattack and heroic strike), these cancel out. 
---
So, the only EXTRA damage heroic strike does is the part on the tooltip after weapon damage. Because you would have done that weapon damage anyways on your autoattack that you don't get any more because heroic strike replaces it.
---
Its better than nothing still
---
Okay it's not gamebreaking if it literally is a recreation of the game. It's exactly the balance that classic looks to recreate.
---
Spirit scaling for out of combat regen starts to drop off sharply around level 30 (when the stam pools are fairly leveled out from base stats), but is very good for questing/mov grinding until then. More so than going pure strength/stam. It's just another bit of the stat optimisation meta.
---
The time you save by killing the mob slightly faster with slightly more strength (like say, 1-2 less swings than you'd normally take) is completely and utterly trivial compared to the time you save not having to use a bandage or eat up. Especially when it starts adding up.
---
It's not even close. 
---
After you switch specs to MS when hitting 40, you want the agility for crit over additional strength.
---
I'm getting flashbacks!
---
It's part of the balance of the version that blizzard is able to restore because they have a working version of it. It's how the game played back then.
---
If they decide to deviate from it there then where is the line where it's not okay to change things for more desired gameplay? 
---
Calling it a bug is an assumption already. Freezing trap was put on the disorient DR. Maybe blizzard was fully aware that it would share a DR with scatter shot.
---
No he's not saying that. He's wondering if they'll announce server lists before they let you make character names.. So you have at least some time to organize with your guild or friends on what server you want to be on.
---
Yea by that I mean Druids don’t have any form of damage mitigation save from a high health bar, decently high armor capabilities, and dodging. 
---
You get one ability that helps with health, frenzied regen, but nothing like shield block.
---
Ever wonder why Orcs can’t be mages?
---
Back when I was subscribed to alexsensual, I watched a stream where he read the old forums. I remember him mocking the participants who asked for features that where eventually added and he disdained , such as 🐼
---
Damn, spotted
---
I hope that Blizzard just hard bans add-ons like questhelper and Atlas (keep DPS meter so we know who to kick from the raid group XD) so players are forced to actually read the quest log and find out where to go right??
---
Exactly! At least those people will be on the same server and not spread out across 10.
---
Scatter Shot and Freezing Trap are apparently different types of CC, I don't know if it was a bug or not, I'm just saying if it was in the game and it was part of class balance it should stay like that.
---
Falstad representing Stormpike guard. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Falstad has nothing to do with the Stormpikes, the stormpike guard is an expeditionary force and these days there are many races in it, including wildhammer dwarves, but the leader seems to be Vanndar who is a stormpike dwarf.... stormpike clan is a thing!
---
Someone call the red shirt guy! we have Falstad in the wrong place. 
---
ps. some other icons are also a little bit questionable but they can be considered accurate enough.
---
This bot would not do well in the UK during normal conversation.

Halo MCC. 
---
Started at CE and went through the campaigns, on legendary, in order, all the way to Halo 4. 
---
It’s been a pleasant journey.
---
They obviously got rewards for turning them it. It would make no sense otherwise because the it would take forever to open if only the big guilds did it.
---
I don't understand what point you're trying to make re: cleave.
---
 There's no argument that slower weapons are better due to the first attack being free, and rend is invaluable at low levels for sure. 
---
But cleave vs heroic strike? If you're always fighting 2 mobs sure cleave is better, but the way you've worded it, it's like you're trying to imply cleave is always better over heroic strike which is just flat out wrong. I feel like I'm missing your point here.
---
In the pod casts defence I think this one did have an above average amount of swearing BUT it was coming from a place of passion and excitement. Anyone offended by that... Well... Thats sad
---
Well you got like a lock box of goodies for your turn ins with the average value being higher if it was high level mats.
---
Some guilds paid casuals to farm for them
---
Some guilds were so powerful they basically held the event hostage until they were ready
---
For me it was a huge money maker on elysium I would open up the the "Lightreaver pot shop" in  ironforge every Sunday around raid times. Up the price by a gold or so and find people that were trying to raid last min and didn't have consumes. I'd farm all week and then sell everything I wouldn't use. I would sell things like a stack of mana pots for 9g a stack mongoose for 14g a stack and elixirs of giants for 10g a stack. Free action pots for 8g a stack. And I would also offer 50 silver per stack fee to make whatever pot you needed. Easily would make 150g every Sunday and what I didn't sell I would donate to my guild bank for dkp or sell to my guildies at a massive discount. 
---
Lastly more centered around the guild aspect of the prof having a guild invest in you with a flask recipe is an awesome feeling and makes you super valuable also they will push you mats all the time. I would also have a standing order weekly from guildies to have their consumes ready for raid day of course at a discount but it was an awesome feeling knowing my prof is providing so much to entire raid each week. Alchemy and herbalism are awesome profs that I get everytime.
---
Excellent, thanks! Good to know bc I was hoping it was Wolves.
---
That isn't leeway though. NPC auto attacks have always ignored the z-axis.
---
If you want me to play the pedant and you're invoking my ignorance of English language, I might as well play along. Here's the fundamental issue your original claim and your current claim.
---
Your current claim (which is correct):
---
"**During** vanilla, freeze trap..." -&gt; The preposition "during" can denote an event within a given time interval. In other words, a part of the duration of Vanilla. Not characteristic of the entirety of Vanilla.
---
Your original claim (which is wrong):
---
"This is how it **was** in vanilla" -&gt; The pronoun "this" refers to 1.12 Scatter DR, the copular verb "is" links this claim with "how it was in Vanilla." The verb "was" denotes the state of being \[of Vanilla\]. Unfortunately, that's not true and you've since backpedaled into agreement and retroactively changed your argument so it didn't contradict reality.
---
\&gt; You are a moron.
---
Truly, I am among greatness. Please take your self-righteous vindication to your blog.
---
I remember they got there by teleport, I am not sure if other classes could have entered.
---
Thanks for the clarification. So your argument it was changed in 1.10, left that way for 10 months and through 2 major patches through vanilla, and then fixed for TBC?
---
My friends re going to play rogue, warrior and mage. I have decided to going healer but Im not sure about what class to pick. 
---
I prefer PVP rather than PVE (cant compromise myself to a raiding guild schedule), and Im thinking about roll for a priest over a Paladin for the PVP tier. What do you think about?? I started playing at TBC and I dont know not much about vanilla gear and tiers.
---
That's incredibly unhelpful feedback to someone trying to make a decision.
---
Lol that is some retail thinking if I ever saw.
---
Dual Spec.
---
Part of me doesn't like that they are 'improving' layering as it's something that's allegedly only going to be in the game for a couple weeks. I get the impression it will be here to stay.
---
Wow, Witcher 3 having a bigger world than wow kind of blows my mind
---
Dota Underlords is surprisingly addictive!
---
thx für die info! war mir zwar klar dass so etwas gemacht wird, aber nicht, wo ich das finden sollte. :D
---
I'm not asking why you don't want to quest and kill mobs, I'm not even asking why you *do* want to do that, I'm asking why are you *trying* to do it.
---
Has that been confirmed at all? I've not seen /sit macros work whatsoever on classic, got any evidence pls?
---
Has anyone seen my corpse?
---
If I wanted to farm rare nodes/spawn, i'd also layer hop. I'd use what mechanic is available and abuse them like anyone should, even if layering didn't exist. Competition means you should use every trick up your sleeve.  
---
However, saying that. Some of these are easy ways to fix them, to make them un-abusable through layering. I wonder if Blizzard will implement them.  
---
Also I give shit all about players controlling AH. The filthy rich who abuse mechanic exist in the past, present, and will exist in future. They always have, and always will exist.
---
Not 100% sure on that, but it feels very alive and I played through it all once to level and was very happy with the experience. End game is trash but the leveling was a lot of fun.
---
The desert area alone is really cool, due to the fact that you lose your map and have to navigate it based on landmarks.
---
Layering can ruin the experience and is not true to vanilla. It changes the dynamics massively
---
WOTF will have 5 sec of immunity and that can be an eternity against the warlock's best counter (rogues).
---
On the other hand, if you are bringing in shamans to the fight, then having pallies on your side is more beneficial.  Buffs, harder to kill than sham, and can dispell fear *and* dots on demand (rather than wait on a 5sec totem pulse, and risk being out of range too).
---
In retail shield doesn't affect rage generation. So uh?
---
The irony of this game is leveling is in many ways more fun than being 60.  You play for months wanting to hit 60, then when you hit 60 you realize a huge part of your progress now is based completely on luck.  No more slowly reaching your goal you either get the drop then win the roll or you don't and you just wasted an hour.
---
The turn ins do give faction rep, but I think most people participated because it felt like you were part of something.
---
I'm obviously not talking about shield anymore but your line in the Sand attitude.
---
Join the next stress test, set up everything, then copy your WTF folder to whatever character you make as your main on August 12th/13th.
---
tbh guys i just really dont want layering at all :( i'm of the "would rather have a busy as fuck launch with queues" group  
---
but i'm not dead against layers, i just hope they are only in the game for a short time and then fully removed
---
&gt; Bold of you to assume that Classic+ would be better and more popular than TBC.
---
I didn't say or mean that at all.  TBC would be the easiest and most popular option after Classic Vanilla by far.  And being the place where I started the game, it's also my personal favorite.
---
But what happens after TBC?
---
Will there be Vanilla servers, TBC servers, WotLK servers, Cata servers, and MoP servers?
---
Will we have just two types: Vanilla servers and TBC servers that eventually update themselves to WotLK, Cata, etc?
---
Will we just stop with only having Vanilla servers and TBC servers, then tell WotLK/Cata/MoP fans that they aren't getting their expansions?
---
I think it's better to pull that bandaid off as early as possible.  Keep Vanilla servers pristine, and have "alternate reality WoW" servers that go in a different direction than the other servers did by maintaining vanilla gameplay philosophies as best as the devs are able to.
---
What do you think would be the ideal situation ~5 years from now?
---
Well, surprisingly patch 1.12 was only a part of Vanilla, not the entirety of it. Vanilla is actually an interval of time taking place during patches 1.12, 1.11, 1.10, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1 and all the minor interim patches between those such as patches 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and so on.
---
You've never been offended by swearing?
---
Just note that you're going to have to hearth back and take the ship every couple levels unless you don't mind missing skills.   Non-nelf classes don't have trainers out there.
---
Definitely! Even the stress test first day was nuts. Took me an hour to kill 8 mindless zombies.
---
I don't think it did actually add to the discussion. It was a random isolated point. Maybe if you backed it up somewhat it would though.
---
Yeah, you gotta feed a rank1 spell to grounding, and/or just kill it with a pet macro.
---
It wasn't neutral, though, right? I distinctly remember accidentally auto-attacking the bastards who crowded around the trainer and flightmaster there and being killed by the guards.
---
Im torn between warlock, priest, and rogue.
---
No explanation. That is all.
---
So the way the mechanic is supposed to work is you need to walk in to the 5 yard melee range, THEN you gain +3 yard leeway if both players are moving. It's not supposed to work for NPCs. So, if you walk up to a player and you're 8 yards away you shouldn't be able to hit them. Should not apply in PVE.
---
I think this is some kind of malware meme that has been spreading on youtube. But in any case, I expect to deeply enjoy seeing warriors running around in spirit robes with staves. So it's all good.
---
To be fair!
---
Wait... are the Paladin ones just screenshots with a filter?
---
That's what OSRS does and it worked and works well.
---
I’m so excited to make this run!
---
They were taken from the classic.wowhead talent builder. I'm unfamiliar with paladins so if they're actually wrong I'll change them.

---
What an amazing dungeon that could have been.
---
Wotf is much better and you don’t look like a gnome
---
The top guild on our server offered a full molten core loot run for the person who mailed them the most materials and an onyxia run for 2nd place. 
---
I think you also got faction rep? So that was another incentive to get faction mounts
---
No, I mean - it looks like Blizzard used screenshots instead of original art!
---
Still gorgeous, but it’s interesting.
---
Steady shot was one, for hunters.
---
Keep googling how English works, though, at least you are trying. 
---
It would save you some time to just admit you misread my first post, though, and inserted the word "always" before "was" when reading it.
---
It just says that no servers are available for me? Is this something on my end?
---
WoW doesn't have instant summons? You have to get a Warlock to summon you with multiple other people.
---
If by players you mean 0.001% of the players, then yes.
---
Eh it's just people blindly defending Blizzard. This happens with fanboys of every game company.
---
A year ago, the very thought of layering/sharding in classic was as ridiculous as LFG, transmog, or flying. It used to be the number one thing people didn't want in classic. Look at where we are now... I bet if LFG was announced tomorrow these same people would start defending the decision with the exact same predictable arguments, just like with layering.
---
I had a group fall apart at the enterance to RFK back in the day. I created a new character to run to Org and /2 for a new group. It was my first bank alt, and still have her there to this day.
---
Only 3 of those games can be considered a "survival" game. Arma2/3 and DayZ. None of them are considered BR games.
---
It's good to see that people aren't forgetting about this. I'm german but I was going to roll on an english server anyway but I still think it's absolutely imperative for Blizzard to provide language-specific servers for Classic. Not only are there no reasonable arguments against it, it's not even a lot of work to provide these servers.
---
I've heard a lot of speculation that Blizzard wants to avoid this because of the customer support layoffs they had in the EU and I would not be surprised if that was the case but it's simply in Blizzard's best interest to change their mind on this.
---
Left-click would target the top dead mob, right-click would always loot the next mob that could be looted, regardless of what layer it was on under the pile.
---
It was slower due to loot lag sometimes but I never had an issue looting stacked mobs.
---
If it's possible to verify that this was ONLY bugged in patch 1.12 and wasn't bugged for the rest of the vanilla lifetime, I think you might have an argument.  Otherwise it's a pretty pointless argument to make imo.  Lots of people played hunter in vanilla, including myself, and it was fine.
---
2***
---
Legion was actually pretty decent
---
I would argue blackfathom deeps is by no means a waste of time. 
---
Algae fists (50%) are a superior replacement to that warsong supplies quest in ashenvale, which requires you to buy shit off the auction house. In addition, you are the only horde class who can even wear them prior to 40. 
---
The strike of the hydra is vastly superior to anything else you could realistically have at that level and shamans/druids cannot use it, so if it drops and you didn't bring a second warrior it's yours.  
---
The tortoise armor (again, 50%) is a great alternative to mutanus's chestplate (obviously, I would prefer mutanus, but wailing caverns is a really ugly dungeon and in my experience it cannot be safely 4 manned, as the last boss has so much crowd control, you cannot retry it, and the dungeon is so long that a person dropping is not uncommon). the only other easy replacement is shadowfang keep, which has a rare spawn that drops a blue chest. 
---
Really, blackfathom deeps has very relevant warrior drops. Certainly better than I expect to get out of shadowfang keep or wailing caverns (or, for that matter, deadmines, as every shaman and druid is gonna roll on smites and you cannot get the chausses of westfall as horde.). 
---
Really, I think blackfathom might be the BEST low level instance for warriors, particularly horde warriors who are stuck swinging a staff until level 25, as boahn's fang is both BOE and not even that good for a dungeon that you kind of need to be level 18 to even tank.
---
Yeah all Russians are exactly alike. /s
---
For me, it's not that overpower is adding a lot of dps ... it just adds a button that you can push once in a while to have something happen and feel like you did something. Otherwise, you pretty much don't have anything like that until you get whirlwind at level 36 (I think). So it's 90% psychological.
---
The other 10% is rogue duels.
---
Well considering shamans can still technically tank in classic, I wonder if the meta would have been different and you'd see more shamans tanking dungeons. They have really bad damage mitigation, but they can generate a ridiculous amount of threat.
---
So, I originally thought this too, I have tested multiple combinations of dual wielding and specs and compared them against white and green 2 handers.
---
2 handers are vastly superior while leveling. I wanted dual-wielding to work for the same reasons you mentioned, that its hard to get good 2handers while leveling, but the fact is as a warrior you need to go out of your way to keep upgrading your 2hander by any means necessary.
---
For alliance specifically, I swapped to dualwield at 50 just because there flat out isn't any options  if you are leveling fast at a server launch - its only -okay- because of the Venomhide Ravasaur poison from Un'goro, Human racial, and you focus on killing mobs lower level than you.
---
You can check out my warrior 1-60 leveling guide where I touch on it a little bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akqzzAA7F08&amp;list=PLiIDj0gsjp3Ci8YDgs12T83TWYvzQymHn
---
Well there it is then. This guy knows it for certain. Listen to him, he's right.
---
Mages can farm diremaul. Every mage I knew was rich af. Should be able to afford the overpriced freezing band. Other classes gotta make money too :)
---
Always divert to get that FP if you're in the area.
---
Back in my day we didn't need to raise our swords to consecrate!
---
Not seeing this at all.  It adds as much to the discussion as the post about the guy who said he will be listening to it at work.
---
Do I need to say why swearing can be offensive?  I would be talking down to people if I explained it.
---
At least leveling alts will be more enjoyable :D
---
If there's no documentation and the behavior is inconsistent with the rest of the games, it's clearly not an intentional change. If it was, then neither of the previous two facts would be true.
---
Yes, that is an assumption. It's also an assumption to entertain the idea that I'm not about to die from a small piece of space debris entering orbit. *Neither* of those assumptions are based in anything but past observation and probability.
---
Ah hah hah hahaha HAH HA
---
Not "gamebreaking." Tired of these sky-is-falling posts WRT hunters...
---
I see. I don't have a subscription now so won't be able to play the stress test unless they open it to everyone.
---
Adding anything that shortens the time to get places kills the feel of a large, living world. Also, every travel convenience lowers the value of an epic mount. So no thanks on that.
---
The philosophy on game design and playing the games has changed so much that people now want to get to the end experience and completely skip anything in-between. A major part of the magic in Classic is ALL the in-between.
---
It's not that relevant... I'm just interested in theory crafting
---
&gt; patch 1.12 was only a part of Vanilla
---
Ye but it's still vanilla, wdym? Going by your logic; if someone said they played in 1.12, then according to you that means they didn't play in vanilla. ??? ???
---
None of these games are "Battle Royale". A majority of these games maps are smaller than Classic WoW.
---
Please travel on foot from Booty Bay to Stratholme. Then from AQ40 entrance to Winterspring.
---
The fact that you listed Arma2/3 shows how little you actually know. I can get from Cherno to NW AF in less than an hour. GL going from Booty Bay to Strat in less than an hour.
---
This is great stuff, thanks.
---
This is purely his opinion and is backed up by zero evidence.
---
The shortcut doesn't get added til naxx patch iirc. On pservers it was disabled for progression.
---
Most people did it until they were exalted with their 4 factions and then stopped. That was usually enough for every realm.
---
I mean adding new cosmetics will not change the entire classic adventure. If you can’t agree with that, never mind
---
It's  not so much as what should I play, rather if my plans are realistic.  
---
Gonna level with a mate: he brings a warrior, I'll go paladin. We are streamrolling through the content, tank+heal always ready for dungeons, great duo in wpvp, everything clicks.  
---
However, we made a deal to only level together, so no desync in xp between us. So I'll roll an "alt" to play on when he is not available, it'll be a mage. Nice for solo, change of pace (from pala), great utility, fun gameplay (for me) etc.   
---
Now onto my question: If I'm totally honest with myself, I feel more like playing the mage, but the dual levelling aspect also calls to me, and I've read wonders about warrior+paladin. Is it realistic to count on me being able to equally play two characters? Not really asking about levelling, more so about "endgame" (farming pre-bis, raid, farm at least rank 10 when honor hits). Can anyone have 2 "mains", or it's just too time-consuming/too much effort? Am I overthinking it, and during the long road to 60 I'll "get the feel" for one of my chars and that'll be my main?  
---
Oh, and I am by no means a time-billionaire, I have a full time job, and in a relationship, but beside these I'm planning to squeeze all of my free time into classic, so I'm thinking about 1-4 hours gametime in the evenings, maybe more on weekends.
---
its my classic and i need it wow!
---
Same for me, messing around with alliance characters on a pserver, will go horde for classic
---
&gt; GL going from Booty Bay to Strat in less than an hour.
---
That can take less than 1 second.
---
... Honestly... If it's not laced with hate, bigotry, or racism... Nope
---
I agree EA releases trash, but do they ever actually promise their games getting better? They might promise DLC but EA never fixes their games, they just make the next game in the series that addresses the problems the previous one had, whilst making new problems, and the cycle repeats.
---
Are you able to read? It seems that maybe you have misread it, or just don't have very good comprehension of reading. Try again I guess? Idk what to say. If you want me too, I can spell it out for you with fewer words, and with color crayons and pretty pictures.
---
How is the behavior of 2 abilities being on the same DR sharing it inconsistent with the rest of the game?
---
Yeah, to each their own. I'd personally drop some gold or some cash just to save a few hours when they matter the most, but that's just me.
---
That's still instant travel...
---
No doubt mages can farm tons of gold by doing Diremaul. But... its not like freezing bands are droping like rain.
---
Uhm a lot??? If the person is a racist, would you take any advice from them?
---
"Going by my logic", they did play in Vanilla. As I just said: Patch 1.12 was a part of Vanilla, but it wasn't the entirety of Vanilla. I don't see your source of confusion, maybe you could try to describe it more clearly for me?
---
I like this better than the OP!
---
Yo champ
---
Go youtube this guy: "skarm tank"
---
From my own experience i can say that he is totaly right ;) gl! 1
---
Wow, didn't even ninja tbe bag?!
---
You actually believe that?
---
You’ll want to do it. The event of the opening of the gates was one of my favorite things during vanilla. Literally everyone on the server was there
---
Yeah, let's add transmog too, since that's just cosmetic.
---
"BIG NEWS: A number of changes have been made to the Layering system! Looks like there is now an internal cooldown on layering that prevents layer hopping instantly. PvP combat, looting nodes/chests, and gaining exp. seem to all trigger the cooldown."
---
Tested on Beta TODAY. This will already help fix a lot of layer hopping exploits.
---
Why not? Just curious, do you have some sort of personal vendetta against him or something? Seems like a very strange thing to say.
---
Because one change leads to another and before long, it's not classic WOW anymore like what happened to retail.
---
You can only do one of Track Minerals / Find Herbs at a time. So not ideal.
---
Wait, why alliance have one more faction?
---
Why is this even relevant when you're talking about the size of the game? It's not. While leveling to 60 you will likely receive ZERO summons.
---
You care about racist peoples opinions?
---
Layer 1-20 zones only is better imo. Kinda made this news disappointing.
---
A million times better. 
---
Played on a lot of private servers with 20k person queue to get in, it wasn't that bad. Sure, took a little longer than normal, but not that much.
---
Let's not.
---
Dota 2 as its TI season and it will tide me over till classic which is right around TI ends
---
Shadow Word: Death was iconic
---
I misinterpreted your intended meaning because it was conveyed in an ambiguous way. I apologize for that error, I'll try and compensate for that in the future.
---
&gt;Yeah and I'm telling you it's probably wrong.
---
Undoubtedly. Unfortunately the sheer reluctance of Blizzard to even make Classic in the first place, the way they added layering in an attempt to combat tourists, and this whole language decision, has led to even the fans themselves thinking that this is gonna be some super niche thing. I say that Blizzard's lack of faith in their own product is going to end up shooting themselves in the foot when it turns out most of what they presume were short-term tourists end up being long-term inhabitants.
---
I can't believe it.  It's a normal human response.
---
The trap lasted at least 12 seconds, and it looks as if his Aimed Shot broke it anyway. 1:27 - 1:39
---
I think if blizzard wants to give players choice and pick sides they should just create neutral factions which are enemies of each other like the pirates and booty bay. That way the players get a lot more choice and it's a lot more engaging and immersive.
---
Yeah, I think people took that comment the wrong way. It's a primarily Alliance instance, and wasn't called DM (at least on my server) until way into BC. So I thought it was dumb that the poster said VC was for psychotic people. I asked if he meant the alliance, and the downvote brigade came through.
---
After flip flopping and changing my mind many time i think i have landed on playing a rogue. My dilemma revolves around PvP and professions. I would likely to do alchemy but feel i will be fucked in pvp if i do not have engineering. I do not want to have both as i want a gathering professions to support the crafting proff i land on. Help me reddit you are my only hope, will i be buggered in PvP without engineering ?
---
It's bettering then layering the entire game.
---
I never even knew I had it until I dug the box out the other day.
---

---
Just shows you that Blizzard can't really "win". That's why they got so used to scoff at their community.... Because of stuff like this.
---
I'll say it here and I'll say it on twitter. Good Job Classic team! You are kicking ass and doing the best possible work to deliver a good experience! Can't wait to play classic.
---
Okay thanks!
---
You missed the opportunity to write "streamer" instead of "beta player"! :P
---
but what about all the high-rez versions i sent you :(
---
Fiddling and diddling around on pservers a little, mostly playing through some backlog of games I haven’t got to.  
---
After playing through dead mines on a pserver a couple of times again, I got into a piratey mood. So I finally played through assassins creed: black flag, freedom cry, and rogue. Good times.
---
Now I’m in an assassins creed mood. I may just continue on with unity, syndicate, origins and odyssey lol
---
Yea I had an addon I used
---
And also while leveling to 60, you're unlikely to see 1/3rd of the world. So that puts even more games as bigger than WoW Classic!
---
There's no argument that slower weapons are better due to the first attack being free:
---
That is so strange to me I am just going to assume it's a typo on your part.
---
Cleave versus heroic strike: the idea is that you just bank rage on single targets, and then cleave down multiple targets with the banked rage. You are correct: you have to spend a significant amount of your time fighting two targets, but that's just something that needs to be done to be doing reasonable dps.
---
- level with a shammy
---
- spam hamstring
---
- proc windfury
---
win.
---
Hoping they test sharding/layering in 1-20 zones too. Sounds like a much better solution. Good thing we are in beta still.
---
It was there a while to be sure. I'd be fine with it staying in or being removed, but if I was making the decision I would say to fix it since the majority of vanilla did not have the bug.
---
This is true, if the realm is full there will be a queue. But knowing servers can be easily merged does open up the possibility for Blizzard to launch a lot of servers and not be worried about how many dead servers there will be in 6 months.
---
It's just different flavors of DPS at that point. What more do you want me to say? 
---
Warlocks pew pew with shadowbolt primarily and with pets. They bring some utility that no other class can offer (like Summoning Stones).
---
Rogues bring melee pew pew and can offer some basic forms of CC.  
---
He knows what the classes do.
---
Won't work. CastSpellByName is protected. There are very few scripts that are allowed in combat since Classic is using the BfA macro system and addon API.
---
I actually forgot about these, I'll see if I can crop them out correctly
---
Another tip is that even at lower levels it can be worth downranking 1 level if no one in your party has that much health. I'd always try and have 1 heal that healed about half the tanks health and another that heals as much as possible. The same with other party members.
---
Knowing the group's HP levels is important for some of your decision making. A mage and a warlock  might both be at half health but the mage might have 400 to the warlocks 800.
---
Cool I can get into a Jet in Arma 3 and travel the map in a few seconds. By your logic that means Arma2/3 is WAY smaller than WoW.
---
We're talking about the size of the world here. Not that you can get summoned.
---
Normal people: Let's have TBC.
---
"Purists": NOOOOO SLIPPERY SLOPE!
---
Normal people: Okay, let's have TBC-style class balance.
---
Also "Purists": Let's have unlimited horizontal expansion forever for free it will totally happen and nothing could go wrong it will be totally amazing!
---
I'd like a toggle to switch between new and old art where applicable. Like they did with the Help remake.  I'd even be fine if it was a mix between new and old where there isn't new art to replace the old.
---
So long as any new art/animation does not effect anyone playing with just old art then i don't see the problem.
---
B I N G O
---
Same, my server choice will greatly depend on where the streamers go, so I won’t be there
---
Hey there. Sent you a friend request on discord. I was hoping you still had some time to discuss your plans for classic. I'm Wildgunmen#9537 on Discord, wildgunmen#1302 on bnet
---
You should reschedule. That is a bad bad idea unless you are just looking to stream log-in queues, crashes, sitting afk waiting for mab-tagging and sliding across the map in loot animations bc the database server is lagged out.
---
it's the way it was in vanilla
---
This combined with 'leeway' just makes ranged even weaker and melee even stronger.
---
Bow to your Warrior overlords.
---
Let me just quote you.  
---
&gt; You are wrong, and it didn't work like this in Vanilla. It worked like this in Patch 1.12 and probably a bit earlier.  
---
   
---
&gt; Vanilla is not 1.12, 1.11, or a single patch  
---
Each and every patch up untill TBC is vanilla. How can you say that 1.12 and the other patches are not vanilla, that makes zero sense.
---
By your logic one would have to play all patches at once to play vanilla because according to you all patches together is what makes vanilla.
---
Booty bay raids all day. So much gold on armor rep 😭😭😭😅
---
All i want is a little heads up, it doesnt have to be exact numbers just a "fixes to layering system" or all the changes they did on the last build.
---
Or stoneform
---
when I did it, if your were only 5 levels higher than the quests for that area, then you were underlevelled.
---
Oh dope. That would have been really cool to see.
---
Welcome to American politics
---
I never leveled in dun morogh, so I might go there for something new. But yah you can’t beat the human starting area and west fall, they’re classics.
---
you're right, there will only be one launch day and that day will be 2-3 hours at most bc the server will be inaccessible for the other 21 hrs.
---
I won't be able to make any sort of speed run or even leveling at a fast speed so I'm willing to sacrifice a few hours for $15 bucks. I'll be meeting up with some friends and I'll probably be ahead of them anyway so no rush. Just want to experience the release, never experienced a fresh WoW game or expansion release so it will be fun.
---
It was not, leeway trick is a compensation for terrible connectivity in 2005, leaving it working in 2019 is doubling down on it.
---
If  you're #nochanges, then you should support removing leeway.
---
I was OT at 15-16 years old in BWL. My PC got so hot that before a big boss fight the whole raid had to wait for me to restart my pc to give it the best chance of surviving the fight. I doubt we'll have to experience these issues again in 2019.
---
My biggest problem wasn't a hot PC that might cause WoW to crash. It was my parents wondering what possible excuse I could have to still be playing video games at 11pm on a school night. 
---
"Guys, you don't understand, 39 people are counting on my to be playing right now. Some of them are adults!!"
---
I think it was Metzen. One of the lead devs HATED Bard classes and would shut down anyone trying to do so. Shaman/Paladin are the vanilla buff bots, they get to press buttons though.
---
Yes, you will be at a disadvantage if you don't go engineering, just how it is. If pvp is going to be your main focus and you want every possible advantage to even the playing field then you must go engineering. If you just want to pvp here and there and do it for fun then who cares, you'll still do fine.
---
Lol I don’t disagree but man you really aren’t a fan of some of the dungeons are you?
---
No one will let you raid as an ele shammy
---
Who’s alli?
---
&gt; We're talking about the size of the world here.
---
Correct, and all these games have a larger world than pre-BC Azeroth. Just because there are faster travel methods in some of the games, does not make their worlds smaller. And if you want to argue travel methods, WoW has the fastest: summons.
---
Nonsense. Druid fighting is the supreme gentleman's sport with an impeccable pedigree going back thousands of years.
---
Of course, such things must be done properly.
---
First, the opponents face each other and exchange the usual courtesies: compliment their distinguished druid lineages, praise the length and volume of their manes in cat from, the sturdy sharpness of their claws in bear, the sheen of their coats in travel and the grace of their aerial acrobatics in aquatic.
---
This done, the opponents shake hands, turn 'round and march exactly 30 yards apart, whereupon they turn 'round again, doff their hats and stow their monocles (can't have them being damaged in the fight, after all) then await the signal.
---
This being given, both combatants shall engage full Moonfire spam. No other spells are permitted, whether offensive or support, nor any shapeshifting or weapon use.
---
Once both opponents are OOM they meet again in the middle to discuss the weather and other small pleasantries, studiously avoiding any mention of inter-factional politics or religious affairs whether novel or ancient, as both regain their energies before deciding whether to continue the engagement for another round.
---
After three such rounds, if neither party has yet emerged victorious, they once again confer to deliberate upon the choice of [Rockhide Strongfish] (https://classicdb.ch/?item=19808) or [Last Year's Mutton] (https://classicdb.ch/?item=19293), whereupon they commence beating each other vigorously about the head and shoulders until one submits or falls unconscious.
---
The victor is allowed the choice of no more than two victory laps or one bear-form face sit.
---
&gt; It was simply overdue to removal
---
If they didn't say that I doubt. Public pressure did it more than "they overlooked it"
---
&gt; I don't care about the launch
---
So wait until they remove layering. Simples!
---
&gt;And also while leveling to 60, you're unlikely to see 1/3rd of the world.
---
What are you talking about? This statement right here tells me that you haven't even played Classic WoW. You literally visit almost every zone while leveling up to 60.

u sure?  what is I am elem up until naxx, then switch to elem/resto to heal?
---
Their racism has no weight in discussions of Wow
---
It's ignorant to ignore everything someone says because they are wrong in something unrelated
---
Plot twist : he purposely tried to throw people off by saying there wont be classic so it would be an even bigger surprise.
---
They would have to rework the ravasaur quest from its Wotlk version to match the time investment of the vanilla wintersabre.
---
They are both S tier in both pvp and pve, play either and you're fine lol.
---
There's no set timeframe for layering, it's just a tool to combat overpopulation during the early days of the game.  
---
They will get rid of it as soon as it is no longer needed.
---
Hinterlands is really bad--I second that. Ashenvale can be bad.. the rogue quest in barrens for poisons can be bad (last night i made that run about 6 times)
---
Same I hate battlegrounds they killed wpvp
---
I try to avoid using cleave because two mobs can be 50/50 chance of death. Also because I take imp heroic strike to reduce the cost by 3 when leveling because I use it as much as possible. Although after 40 with sweeping strikes I remember cleave being worth the rage in multi combat.
---
A person being racist doesn't suddenly make them wrong about everything else.
---
Tracking herbs and humanoids/beast etc are not mutually exclusive
---
I actually like the lonely games. I like the feeling that you're the only one around, until suddenly you're not.
---
Yeah, if someone says VC I know what they mean, so it's not a problem for communication and I'm not going to correct them.... but I'm somehow still kinda bitter from post 1.3 when I got a lot of "LOL scrub, Deadmines is VC now."  I guess getting treated like I was trash just because I didn't keep up with the sudden change made me just want to hold on to the old way that much more.
---
I was buying them for myself duh.

also rogues, they get mouseover macros to not lose combopoints + blind not sharing dr with poisons and itself
---
Hmm, make some gold to sit in your account, or advance the game you love.

Average ping has only increased by 100ms or so since then.

They need to fix that leeway shit
---
The patch for classic is called 1.13. So classic is literally the 1.13 patch of the game.
---
&gt; win the roll or you don't and you just wasted an hour.
---
That's a pessimistic way to view dungeons and raids, IMO.  For me it was always about goofing off with friends in voice chat.
---
&gt;And if you want to argue travel methods, WoW has the fastest: summons.
---
You're the one arguing the methods here bud. I'm trying to tell you how big the world is but your only response is that you can get summoned.
---
You listed Arma2 and 3.
---
Go play Chernarus and travel from the coast to the top of the map. You'll do it in less than one hour.  Try doing the same with WoW.. It'll take you more than one hour.
---
&gt;Most of them I've never touched. 
---
Why are you so intent on arguing that these games have bigger maps when you haven't even played them YOURSELF?
---
I already had the pic from the wildahmmer clan, but they didn't fit on the chart so I just relabeled it as stormpike and hoped no one would notice
---
you found me out
---
Completely different issues though. If classic wow were to release tomorrow it would be a great experience. There's no core game functions that are fundamentally making the game bad. It's very specific targeted issues, mostly on the tech side of things.
---
I get it that people feel fucked over by BFA (trust me, I'm in that group), but I don't think it's fair to compare BFA's shitstorm to issues we are seeing in the classic wow beta. By all means express your concerns! That's needed! But comparing it to BFA's launch, and especially azerite armor which is the core main gearing feature of the game, and how absolutely broken it was....Not even in the same ballpark.
---
They could've released the demo version from Blizzcon 2018, it would still be a more than okay experience. I think we are on a good track to get the game in August in a great state.
---
Layering is still shit
---
Because DR effects are grouped according to specific categories. Confusion, Disorient, Stun, Random Stun, Charm, etc.
---
All effects within a given category DR only within their unique category, unless there's a specific exception noted. For example, **Scatter Shot:**  📷 [**Patch 5.3.0**](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_5.3.0) **(2013-05-21):** Now shares diminishing returns with [\[Freezing Trap\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Freezing_Trap) and [\[Wyvern Sting\]](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Wyvern_Sting). 
---
Scatter Shot and Freezing Trap are different DR categories and should therefore DR only within their unique category. This was mentioned in the video. If they were the same category, then they should also DR with every other effect within each other category as well, but they don't.
---
I'm not fact checking this at the moment but as far as specifics go: I think in Vanilla Scatter Shot was variously a Confusion and Disorient effect, and shared its DR with Dragon's Breath, whereas Freezing Trap was an incapacitate or a freeze effect, and so it shared it with other like-minded effects, but not with Dragon' Breath.
---
You right but it does make they’re opinion about things irrelevant
---
My first character was a dwarf warrior named gimmili. I never got to level 60 in vanilla, only level 54. I’m gonna try and get that name (the actual spelling though) and finally level him to 60.
---
I cried when my mother died and when my son was born...
---
I've started going through all of the Resident Evil games for the first time.
---
Welp time to reroll.
---
Thank you! Nice work!
---
I'm not worried about getting burnt out so I'm playing a little final fresh (and loving it). But I will play other things while I wait, too. Final fantasy 7 with my fiance, borderlands 2, overwatch, darts. Maybe something else we'll see.
---
Yeah more 60 dungeons. But without catch up mechanics just reasons for naxx geared players to run them. Rep, mount drops(but don’t go crazy) or unique class quests. A part of a legendary quest chain.
---
You're misunderstanding his comment. He isn't saying "nobody calls deadmines VC," because obviously people do. He is saying that no one calls Dire Maul DM, which is true. Even people who use VC call Dire Maul DM N, DM E, DM W, or DM Trib. He isn't saying the other sides position is unthinkable, just that its kinda pointless.
---
&gt; Adding anything that shortens the time to get places kills the feel of a large, living world. Also, every travel convenience lowers the value of an epic mount. So no thanks on that.
---
The game would still feel epic without me needing to fly 8 circles around everything. Maybe they could add an "epic" flight option.
---
Enhancement Shaman for your dad! That way he’ll always have a group and he can play something fun as fuck!
---
Doesn’t sound like it’s a bug. Sounds like a balance change blizzard made in 1.10.

Abolish poison removes all poisons from the druid for 8 seconds. To answer your question, at 60 a druid has 5-6k mana and travel form costs 179, so alot.
---
It’s been so long so I forget, do you have to discover graveyard spawns to be able to spawn there
---
As soon as i heard ”icecream” my heart went ballistic, and i ran screaming for my brother
---
Im still gonna be happy as hell getting the 40 and 60 mount.
---
Running around in classic will still make the world feel big.
---
Mageslayer.... a warrior...poor choice
---
It's always interesting to see how many others also love the tauren but dislike kodo mounts. I love them as big Azerothian bison analogs but they're just built all wrong for anything to be riding them. Plus, as noted, their running animation is simply terrible.
---
This is amazing! My wife is also very supportive of this hobby! She doesn’t play but she’s knows it’s the only thing I spend money on.
---
they shouldn't be on the same DR, jfc. It's like people don't understand what's this about. Freezing trap is a \*FREEZE\* and Scatter is a \*DISSORIENT\*
---
The only thing I’ll miss is everyone being a complete noob on every level.
---
No explanation. That is all.  /s
---
Warlock + priest vs rogue. Do you mind being ranged vs melee? Are you more focused on pvp or pve? Theres going to be a higher than class average amount of players playing rogue, does this trouble you? Do you like healing for dungeons or raids?
---
Feign death resisted
---
According to statistics warlock will be least played.
---
I don’t think that is too difficult a task considering the massive work the devs are doing rn.
---
I’m pretty sure resto Druid got a more instants. And numbers tuned to have some pretty insane heals
---
Damn, I never tought about how mouseover macros in vanilla is a direct buff to rogues lol
---
&gt; Some guilds were so powerful they basically held the event hostage until they were ready
---
How? Could I not just turn in the stuff any way?
---
This sub is a bunch of jonesing former crack addicts that have been watching the crack factory get slowly rebuilt and is 2 months away from opening.  
---
There is no calm rationality to be found here, only the clawing, screeching, and convulsing of junkies focused entirely on their upcoming fix.  They're at the same time all-consumed by anticipation and the promise of release and terrified at the risk that the high might not get their rocks off like it did the first time unless everything is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.
---
It's a sad, pathetic sight.  I can't wait either.
---
Oh, that’s good. May the shards be ever in your favor.
---
You're thinking of glancing blows pushing crits off the table when you're attacking high level mobs. This is not the same for when you're tanking a boss.
---
Also note that a level 61 mob requires 10 less defense to be crit capped against.
---
In regards to shield block, it prevents crushing blows and I'm not sure how much of an issue these are vs. lower level mobs (ie. 61 tigers) or against faster attacking mobs. I understand a slow swinging boss can get a crushing blow and just crumple a tank.
---
Agreed on almost all points. A minor correction to the following:
---
&gt; So you hit three mobs w whirlwind, and that also sweeping strikes 3 times so each mob gets hit twice. 
---
The way it's working on the beta right now is that sweeping strikes caps at 2 hits per ability. So cleave will sweep twice, but whirlwind will also only sweep twice, even if you hit 3 or 4 mobs.
---
Arms is a great leveling spec, and it's very clearly designed to be used with a slow two-handed weapon. The farther you deviate from that the worse it will perform.
---
It's because this fanbase is highly toxic
---
THINK OF THE KARMA
---
"This content is not available." 
---
That's what it says when you try to get into the Beta too, isn't it?
---
People can hate asmon all they want but he can make some great event happen.
---
Fun up until the wall around 450 gear score but yeah I enjoy the world more than the game play now
---
Bingo. I would expect blizzard to check their reference client and leave it as is according to that.
---
It's kind of freaky how many of these factions I never interacted with.  What was the community engagement rate with the waterlords?
---
Which is a ridiculous strategy.  
---
The population of a server with fluctuate over the life of Classic, this is normal and expected.  
---
Are they going to turn layering back on every time a major content patch launches and the server spikes back to 10k concurrent players? That would be a disaster
---
Skip to 1:56, it's a lot prettier in your own client so I'd suggest you find a way to explore the zone yourself but it's really beautiful and my favorite place that was never shown.
---
https://youtu.be/glVoH9eQnWo
---
J Allen Brack was right all alonge.
---
People don't want vanilla, they want an oficial private server.
---
Scatter shot was a disorient. Freezing trap was added to that category. And it's still in the same one to this day.
---
You've become a star in this community sir! It'd be interesting to hear about how expectations/aspirations/goals for the podcast has evolved since the early days. If you Josh from episode 1 was told he'd eventually have ex blizzard employees become a part of a regular segment, how would he have reacted?
---
It shouldn't I agree but based off this initial feedback/testing it most certainly could/can.
---
It's not a bug. You are wrong.
---
The point of 2h leveling is that you harmstring kite and if you miss and you dont do dmg for 7 sec like you said you also dont get dmg for the same amount of time. Dual wielding kiting is almost impossible because you would miss out on your own swings aswell which means you have to stand there like a rogue and eat way more damage.
---
You also cant make the point that you almost get no good 2h weapons until WW axe and then name Sword of Omen/Serenity as a good example of good 1hand weapon quest rewards which you arguably get even later than WW axe.
---
IMO you get more often a 2h weapon as a quest reward than a 1hand. On both sides. Like Archeus, Brute Hammer, Runic Darkblade which are solid 2hand weapons until WW axe.
---
7.5 minutes as non wisp
---
Oh how the mighty private server hunter elite have fallen.
---
Yeah, it would be a shame to actually have to rediscover secrets of old. How will we min max perfectly if people cant tell us exactly how to play the game?
---
https://youtu.be/Op9kWkI4F-I?t=338 and then considering https://classicdb.ch/?spell=13048 lasts 12 seconds or if 12 swings are used then you should be able to get 5 or 6 attempts in at re-proccing enrage. Mob attack speeds are generally 2.0 seconds. The only chance of getting 5 attempts in instead of 6 is based on if youre dual wielding and depending on the speed of your weapons and the chances of proccing flurry to hasten your swing speed. Maybe worst rng and weapon scenario (considering youd want a slow mainhand) it could be only 4 attempts in to re-proc it. Even then if it takes an extra swing from the mob its not the biggest deal its still huge uptime. The enrage is not only an increase in direct damage dealt but also rage regeneration which is huge. When you unlock bloodthirst and whirlwind and use some of the charges with that its still a strong talent regardless since extra rage means easier chance to keep up flurry etc.
---
Neither is scatter and trap sharing DRs
---
Wishing for that Teebu's.
---
I mean sure if common logic is "mental gymnastics" to you.
---
Warriors can have a lot of macros starting with Auto switching into the correct stance whenever you are hitting a certain ability to weapon and shield swapping in stances and abilities. 
---
You can get really creative.
---
You don't need to be a ninja or a "dick" in order to get squelched.  You could just say something against-the-grain (IE, "I think retail is 100x better than Classic") in Barrens general chat and you'd likely get reported enough times for trolling that you'd get squelched.  Heavy-handed automation like this is not a good fit for a game like Classic.
---
Just a heads up, you're being more toxic than anyone I've seen against RCR.  In fact, if I had to wager a guess, I'd say you might be on the receiving end of the aforementioned scenario if you went into Barrens general chat acting like this.
---
Unfortunately hamstring kiting doesn't seem to be working for me on the beta with current melee leeway. I'm taking two hits before I can get out of melee range again.
---
If they change this it may be viable again.
---
I would love if they added a few of the bc spell changes or additions added to either items or tier set bonuses in a newer raids. 
---
Like have a set bonus to make rejuvenate for druids be stackable or something.
---
Just have to adapt and start playing around max range instead of going for CC chains. And honestly thats how hunters were meant to be played, they always shined in wpvp where they could kite forever not dueling.
---
If that's the case, then keep it. Honestly, I'm fine either way. I adapted in. Vanilla and used other traps more often with entrapment because of this very reason. 
---
I think people think it was a bug due to traps not being a disorient and scatter being one. Seems like they shouldn't with that logic, but idk.
---
Going to time Van Halen's Runnin with the Devil in my playlist for this.
---
&gt; 
---
For example, if mob A has a 25% (1/4) chance to drop Item X, then n equals 4. After 4 kills, if you still haven't seen the drop, don't fool yourself into thinking that the game is cheating you. You only had a ~63% chance to get the drop within n kills. Every kill of mob A has the same 25% chance of dropping Item X, regardless of how many have been killed already.
---
(This, but with the caveat that the approximation is bad for tiny n. The actual probability in this case is 75%. The more frustrating the drop chance the better treating it like 63% chance in n kills will work.)
---
We're in pretty much identical situations and I'm planning on doing the exact same thing, just with a warlock(friend)/druid(me) combo and a hunter for solo play. 
---
I don't think its unrealistic at all, but it is definitely going to take lots of time to get both characters level'd to 60 and then geared as well as honor grinds and all that. You'll just have to do one at a time, kind of unrealistic to grind honor on both at the same time.  
---
That being said, there's plenty of time! Classic isn't going anywhere. Once you get to 30/40 leveling is going to become really slow, so it will be nice having an alt to play on while you let your paladin gain rested exp or wait for your friend who might not be playing as much.
---
This hasn't been working for me on the beta with the melee leeway issues.
---
It seems that I could do it but it takes a lot of precision and its way more work than it's worth atm. 
---
This could change if they fix leeway.
---
You can use an add-on like Bartender or Bongos to bind keys to an actionbar that you then hide.
---
There was also an epic questline that involved a number of raids and individual grinding, to actually open the gates.
---
Is it established that this was intended in 1.10 and not a bug? If so, I'm fine with it. But if it is simply an unintended bug they didn't fix until tbc, then I'd be ok with fixing it.

That's a whole lot of zones you never visit while leveling Horde.
---
Or maybe we want to see if a mechanic is bugged and not working properly and have evidence to show others that tested it had proper results?
---
Freezing Trap never left that category. It got renamed at some point during cataclym to mesmerize. Freezing trap isn't a freeze even today.
---
Vanilla is an interval of time. It's not a single patch. You don't need to have played all the patches to have played in Vanilla - That doesn't really make sense.
---
My point is that releasing Classic as Patch 1.10 or 1.1 or any other 1.x patch is just as valid a Vanilla experience as 1.12. 1.12 is not Vanilla what Vanilla *is*, because Vanilla *is more* than 1.12. That's all there is to it. 
---
\&gt;  Can't you hear how stupid that sounds? 
---
Why are you upset?
---
What world buffs are in Theramore?
---
It adds so much value and complexity to the game that honestly, I'd love for Blizzard to throw those servers up. Even if they're seasonal or something.
---
The best way to beat pirates is to compete with them, after all.
---
In low level zones the mobs aren't running faster it seems.
---
Also they tend to stutter if they attack so I can't kite kill mobs as melee when I'm running from one area to another like I could on pservers.
---
It _does_ happen in retail.  Furthermore, retail is a completely different beast than classic and they need to be treated as such.  Vanilla's interpersonal dynamics are simply not comparable to retail's, and features that affect this should be removed.
---
Not sure why you assume you will always be fighting against 2 mobs at the same time when using a 2-hander and against one mob at a time when dualwielding.
---
That being said, I myself will most likely stick with arms while leveling because sweeping strikes is just too good to get asap.
---
Because I looked up the square mileage of every game. Dumbass.
---
anime nerf alert
---
The Classic team seems differnt, but Blizzard as a whole has not been listening to Beta feedback on Retail for a long time.
---
That's how to Beta for Azeroth meme came about. Tons of reported bugs made it to launch and complaints of the Azerite gear system fell on deaf ears.
---
Do you have anything backing you up?
---
In patch 1.10 freeze trap was added to DR list but we have no idea which DR list. What if it was added to the same list as scatter and therefore for patch 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12 it shared a DR with scatter. Is that really a bug or just how it was then?
---
Beautiful as these are the rogue, priest (cept shadow) and warlock one never made any sense to me
---
I thought the same but I have a large friends list and huge guild just in beta
---
I do this, too, which is why I'll never set speedlevel records.
---
Appreciate the kind words, I would say that the stars are the guests though, so many people wanting to call in and they’re so great when they do, I just enjoy a chat :) If I could go back and tell episode 1 me that, then I’d be surprised for sure, particularly at their level of involvement!
---
Need one essence for the rod as well. The robes have a 20% chance to drop essences so in 10 robes there's a decent chance you'll get two of them.
---
Did you EVER play at launch of a server? It's fucking hell. Only people against it don't realize how bad it's going to be.
---
If there's a "massive new content patch"...guess what...that doesn't mean people will reroll lvl 1 characters.
---
Yup. That’s exactly the line of thinking I was considering myself
---
Or you can report the bug and the people who are literally MAKING the game will tell you if its working as intended or not.
---
I like this solution. Just let people decide for themselves. I would take a queue over layering in a heartbeat if I had the choice.
---
I am having issues with hamstring kiting with the leeway. 
---
I can do it but I need considerably more space since I can't run back through the mob I have to continue moving backwards and around in order to stay on the edge of the leeway range.
---
Yeah this is what I’m hoping for like maybe 6months after naxx opens do a little content update. I would love for it to lead up to a 60 Kara raid with attunement being 60 dungeons. Maybe some new ones and some raids
---
Yes and no. 
---
&gt; if you allow people a longer amount of time to react to something than they actually had that's not an increase to skill.
---
This is true, except in the situation where there was no time whatsoever to react in before. The batching skill increase comes in the form of creating a window for spells that you could not otherwise react or predict. As an example point blank death coil. Without spell batching the coil lands faster than human reaction speed and the enemy never had a chance of reactively avoiding it. Spell batching adds a window which allows the enemy to perform an outplay that without batching would not be possible. Most players never take this window due to not being skilled enough, but a great player can for example vanish it by reacting fast. There's also examples of this that show pure prediction, such as vanishing blinds or cheap shots. These are examples of spells that you cannot reactively avoid (by the time you see the animation you are too late to react no matter how long the batch delay is), but if you can predict the spellcast within a single batch (something that requires great knowledge of the situation and the matchups) you can avoid them. Top players take advantage of this constantly. Surely you are not implying that people like Perplexity only vanish other rogue's blinds and cheap shots by "total accident" thanks to batching, and skill or planning never had anything to do with it.
---
Obviously you can take this too far where spell batching no longer is a display of skill level. I'd even argue that the spell batching in classic beta (400ms) is too long where it starts to mudden up the argument for spell batching increasing skill. Having no spell batching allows nobody to make these plays and having a full second allows virtually everybody to do so. The sweet spot is somewhere inbetween and everybody has their own ideas of where it resides which is the real issue. A lot of people are happy with the 400ms spell batching because it allows them to do plays that they were never skillful enough to do on private servers (most of which have spell batching of 200-300ms). Simultaneously, the high level players who were able to do these plays on faster spell batching are upset that their displays of skill are "watered down" by making them easier and accessible to worse players.
---
So in a world without batching a player using an important ability leaves the enemy NO WAY of countering it no matter the skill level. With spell batching it allows people to predict or react to it. The delay determines how easy and how many people this counterplay is accessible to.
---
Like patch 1.10 when freeze trap was added to Dr list? Is it really a bug if it was sharing the same DR with scatter from the point it was added to the DR list?
---
Say what? That’s the whole point of 440 defense, to get the 5.6% boss chance to crit down to 0.
---
Ultimately you may be right. And I hope so!
---
As far as goals go, I just want the show to keep trying to get better every week :)
---
I believe dominos does this
---
That's why feral will be brought in good guilds.  Gearing 7 warriors is a lot easier than 8.
---
Is the arms background... Frostmourne?
---
Yes, but the whole point of defense cap is not crushing blows, but rather crits.
---
a demon hunter on the box art in vanilla lol
---
It is even worst if they are going against a Hunter. As a rogue I always had to choose between CCing the Hunter pet and losing my combo points, or keeping the Hunter targeted to not lose it, if you don't CC the pet, he won't let you reset the fight by re-stealthing, but if you try to CC him, you lose your combo points, is a trade off, right now the Rogue can CC your pet without losing anything.
---
Not a bug - these abilities DR'd each other in the version of the game classic is based on.
---
As far as I understand, items will become available in phases similar to how they released; but, each item will be the 1.12 version of the item. This is why druid community is jazzed about tanking; a big itemization and talent/spell change to bear took place by 1.12 making it viable.
---
&gt;the gloom and doom in this sub originates from people who don't have beta access and are so bored and obsessed that all they do is over-analyze videos from clickbait streamers/youtubers who prey on negativity and outrage culture. 
---
And most of them can't be assed to take 5 minutes and think about how software engineering actually works, especially with a spaghetti code such as WoW's (no matter if it's vanilla or current). Most either don't think about it or choose to ignore rationality.
---
this, most ppl want stuff after naxx as if naxx is gonna be something everyone clears (its not)
---
Zones like aszhara, deadwind pass, moonglade (more malfurion quest, maybe rep) etc. would be awesome.
---
i'm playing underlords
---
Going to WC RFD/K or SM as alliance is such a glorious thing on a pvp server. The epic mountless/flightless journey itself results in hardship and friendship way before you even manage to start the dungeon. so no thanks.
---
Yep. Best to just head to the Winchester, grab a pint, and wait until Aug 27th.
---
Although the /sit method doesn't work in Classic, I still prefer Fury until level 40 and Blood Craze and Enrage are often up anyways. Mobs seem to crit frequently enough to make these talents very helpful.
---
It gave faction rep so it was a great way to get the other races' mounts.
---
Why should you have a way of countering something that has already hit you?
---
That's what batching does, it allows you to be hit by something that causes loss of control of your character, and yet still act. That's the antithesis of fair gameplay. That's not counterplay, it's not skill it's just abusive mechanics.
---
Some people enjoy the game by min maxing and get told by others that's the wrong way to play.
---
Some people enjoy playing casually and get told by others that's the wrong way to play.
---
Who cares? Do your own thing and enjoy it
---
Damn it actually has been that long? It's kinda scary when I think about it. How often I really did check this subreddit, how often I looked up things about classic, how often I watched YouTube videos, how often I watched Asmon react to those same YouTube videos. 600 days of checking this subreddit, 600 days of classic videos. It's really blowing my mind thinking about this. I'm crazy enough to where I don't even think I missed one day either. Bring classic wow the FUCK on already baby.
---
I played a paladin in Vanilla and while I enjoyed certain things about it like bubble hearthing &amp; the free 40 mount (the 60 mount quest was incredible &amp; one of my favorites of the whole game but honestly more expensive than a normal epic mount after all the materials and time spent) but I found the pvp &amp; combat in general to be pretty boring. mostly just auto attacking, cleansing, and flash healing. I guess that could be said for a lot of classes, but I think priest is way more fun in both pvp and pve.
---
Hank hill bad assery over there
---
I think flying, dungeon finder and layering/sharing should be worked into classic.
---
Honestly, I was being an ass. I can see how it would look like I'm trying to say it was the defacto state of how things were in vanilla, especially since this thread is mostly debating taking it out or not. Just got a bit carried away.
---
As far as this whole debate goes, I think it depends on whether Blizzard intentionally meant it as a balance change or accidentally put traps on the disorient DR. I don't think anyone has shown any documentation one way or the other, just that there is no specific mention that it was intended to be that way.
---
I agree, well said. See, this guy gets it!
---
Jamie, pull that up
---
They've literally been wrong a handful of times already, we didn't pull the data comparisons out our asses, most of them were scoured numbers of people's blog posts or personal forums with guides and metrics on them. We can't tell them what we think is a bug if we have no idea what is abnormal about the behaviour we observe.
---
Well, there's this old forum post.  
---
https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/general-discussion-30/a-relative-size-comparison-of-game-world-maps-fasc-414833/
---
That’s kinda the discussion. Either follow the path they did back then too a t.Or make a new future for classic wow where they don’t add outlands and new classes no flying but instead fill out original Azeroth but not increase the level cap just add content to the vanilla game. 
---
Which they did have a ton of stuff kinda in the works that basically got scrapped (or fundamentally changed) when they started working on the burning crusade.
---
I would agree that holy pally will likely be better since only one HoT can be on a player at a time and you have less utility to provide the team. Though a druid will give you great mobility and survivability, but that's really only good for solo play.
---
Nemesis looks pretty cool and that is t2
---
What you said isn't even a little bit what I'm talking about. What I'm saying is you have the flightmasters at points A and B and the gryphon takes you from A to B. If you then get the gryphon at point C, going from A to B diverts you to point C, adding time to the A to B trip. Not all flights are like this but some were, I just don't remember which ones.
---
Angry Asian Man I believe https://youtu.be/t9V1TsVl5A8
---
Brother in that same video he cannot replicate it in PvE.. [https://youtu.be/Op9kWkI4F-I?t=462](https://youtu.be/Op9kWkI4F-I?t=462) meaning only PvP can you sit/stand to force the crit.  
---
The suggestion being that then for leveling that this is not going to work, so I think arms is still objectively better.
---
Hmm. 
---
Silverpine Forest, Duskwood, and Deadwind Pass were zones I visited while leveling to 60 using a leveling guide. I also went to Wetlands and Redridge Mountains to wPvP.
---
Why would I be visiting Alliance starting zones as a HORDE while leveling up?
---
Very true
---
Fuck off with the "VC" meme already, it's not even funny to say "VC".
---
They can also open up new servers and offer free transfers, they did that a lot during vanilla and from what I can remember it was pretty successful. 
---
Also the private server culture will probably exist for a while and new servers means instant rerolls every time.
---
The launch clusterfuck is part of the experience, again, this is something that has been stated to death. If you don't want the launch mess then play retail or wait a few weeks.
---
If you think server populations aren't going to bulge out every content patch, you're horrifically deluded. It's par for the course.
---
Lots of casual 60s will make a return for every content patch to run stuff like Diremaul, BGs and to take part in world events.
---
Do you have documentation of those DR categories for Vanilla?
---
The 2 different effects should not be affecting each other, evidenced by the fact that it was fixed a few months later.
---
I also can't say I've been offended by the average swear word, certainly not anything contained in this podcast. The notion of a noise affecting my life to the point of offence is not something I'd like to include in my life. I can understand if there are kids in the vehicle or something, but I think there is some inconsistency if you can tolerate a game with weapons/magic intended to kill others but  are offput but coarse language! Just my take :)
---
I wouldn't worry too much. If you get both to 60 then you could also play the mage with the warr. Yea, you might not be min maxing, but BGs would be fun and you could still be in the same raid/dungeons with a random guild healer.
---
I want to be able to read all the old server drama again. That shit used to keep me entertained at work for hours.
---
It actually disturbs me how many people can't grasp what you are trying to say.
---
choose warsong1,2,3 ect in character creation
---
Is the general chat shared between Layers? If not that would suck for group finding.
---
They aren't going to give an RP-PVP server, but they'll give you one of whatever type you want to play on without layering?
---
Well you used a really shitty leveling guide then.
---
I don’t know that there are. Vanilla freezing trap was considered an incapacitate. What is scatter shot? An incapacitate is it not?
---
My man!!
---
I feel a bit whooshed
---
I made the comment because my read on your comment was essentially throwing down on min-maxers. Wanting the old forums back for min-max research is a valid thing
---
If you want to play BfA, yes. If not, no.
---
It took me 20 minutes to figure out how to move around (as an 12 year old kid who only played Runescsape). I was vigorously clicking the mini map thinking the game was broken.
---
I love the fact that these intense arguments are over weapons that will be replaced in 1-2 levels. Never change /r/classicwow
---
Not possible since the only reference client blizzard has is 1.12. So yeah just how it was then.
---
Also what of you have a server with two shards, one being capped out and almost having queues and one having like 500 pop. Do you still merge them to make an even bigger queue or do you let the ghost realm become its own where nobody plays?

I saw a level 60 Rogue in some badass gear absolutely wreck like 8 people at once (all only level 30-35, of course), including myself and two friends. They started strategizing ways to kill him and I just said "brb, making rogue now"
---
There are no word buffs in Theramore.
---
Shadow priest for sure, but as a rogue (or any melee class) you're extremely dependent on heals. so unless you have a dedicated healer it can be a pretty bad time.
---
Classic wont have the same graphics. I can't say whether binding keys on retail will cross over to Classic, my sense is no though. My opinion: dont buy BFA unless you will 100% play it. You dont need BFA to play Classic - only a subscription is required.
---
You also dont need to be prepping key bindings 2 months in advance.

if your going to the molten core, pretty high I'd say

Nah, it just spawns you at the designated graveyard for the area you died in
---
Well you didn't do a good job because the very first game you listed is 100% smaller than WoW. Dumbass.
---
WoW - 207 km
---
Witcher 3 - 135 km
---
I read the Manual and watched the cinematic over and over again until I got it working and could play lol
---
I would not want this. 
---
Or, rather, I would want this for the convenience, but despite that I would not want it in the game. You get a couple of “cheap” respecs to try different styles out, but at a certain point you should commit. You’re not a warrior who can tank or dps as necessary, you’ve committed to perfecting the art of protection.
---
Resto druids should be MUCH higher on this list... especially considering this takes into account flag carriers for bgs.  Also, Fire mages are listed way too high as they get DELETED by all melee classes (unless they get lucky with a 2-shot).

---
Fair enough, although a lot of people on this sub seem to use "Blizzard" interchangeably with "Classic devs".
---
That is not even remotely my experience from private servers.
---
If I come into a pull with 60+ rage, that means I get an autoattack+rend  on the first mob before the second even gets in range. Then on my second autoattack, I cleave the two of them, then rend the second mob.
---
My my fourth attack hits at ~10.5 second, with one mob probably not even getting in for ~2 seconds and the other being stunned for 1. So I have taken total, 9.5+8.5 mob-seconds of attention.  
---
At this point, I have autoattacked once, rended twice, cleaved 3 times, and possibly demo shouted. One mob has taken 4 autoattacks, +15 cleave damage, +3 rend ticks, each of which is probably 12 damage ignoring armor. The mob probably has 600ish health.
---
so, 600-36 (rend ignores bleed) =564. Say, 30% damage absorption. 
---
Your autoattacks are probably AT LEAST 120 damage raw, at this point. (your floating combat text numbers will be much lower at this point, due to armor reduction. Meaning 4 autoattacks are probably ~480 raw damage, or 336 damage past armor. the mob is now at like 1/3 health. 
---
If anything at all breaks your way, he's already running. A crit, an overpower proc from the secondary target dodging (or rend getting dodged, as you can just reapply rend and your globals are not being pressured during cleave spam anyways. Soon as 1 is running, you halve the incoming damage, but you also get to start hamstring kiting. 
---
You can easily see how ANYTHING going your way means one of your two targets is already running. A crit? sure. one extra auto of damage plus deep wounds will do it. A dodge on your secondary target? sure. You don't have to overpower the guy who dodged your attack. And you just rended twice and put out 6 autoattacks. good chance someone dodged something. 
---
This is incredibly gear dependent, but to be honest, that is how I like to play warrior. I am the guy running around with food buff, 4 potion buffs, and running every instance multiple times for blues. Warriors, are gear dependent. 
---
But I also feel that warrior SHOULD be fighting mobs 1-2 levels lower than you. I am thinking about actually excel spreadsheeting it up to make this argument, because I see a lot of info, mainly from kargoz' class guides, stating the opposite (and I strongly suspect that is wrong for warrior). 
---
You lose a bit of exp per kill, but I think it's almost certainly made up for in reduced mob armor, reduced mob hp, and reduced aggro range allowing you to more easily set up your ideal pulls, along with more efficient quest completion (because any hard quest pulls become much easier due to reduced aggro range and just generally being stronger relative to quest mobs, while still getting full quest exp and rep).   
---
Also, you get sweeping strikes at 30, not 40. 40 is mortal strike.
---
Maybe classic will have much higher mob damage than private servers, but I doubt it. And my experience with multiple private server warriors is that it is very realistic to cleave spam from 20-30.
---
Patches have balance changes. DRs kept changing a lot between vanilla and cata. Blind and Cyclone for instance changed tons of times
---
Cats.
---
Joana's World is a shitty guide? World Record 60 is a shitty guide? Okay dude. I'm done responding to you.
---
Do you want retail!? Because this is how you get retail!
---
&gt; Vanilla is an interval of time. It's not a single patch.
---
I disagree. Vanilla is each and every patch starting from the very first patch released to public, up untill TBC.  
---
&gt; You don't need to have played all the patches to have played in Vanilla - That doesn't really make sense.  
---
But that's literally what you are saying.  
---
&gt; releasing Classic as Patch 1.10 or 1.1 or any other 1.x patch is just as valid a Vanilla experience as 1.12  
---
Yes, true. But Blizzard has officially stated that they build Classic on 1.12.  
---
&gt; Vanilla is more than 1.12.  
---
I feel like you are talking more about what the vanilla experience is rather than what actual vanilla is. While Blizzard might try to cover the whole vanilla experience as much as they can, they only focus on what was present in 1.12.  
---
&gt; Why are you upset?  
---
What makes you think I'm upset? I'm really not.  
---
Just asking a question.
---
Haha nice. I was obsessed with heroes last year but it’s hard to find a match in Aus now
---
The ability to exploit it may very well only exist because it's beta.  You can't just create your own layer whenever you want.  You set a population limit, lets say 100.  The first 100 logins all get put in layer one.  Player 101 logs in.  That layer is full.  The system generates a new layer and puts player 101 in it.
---
The only way to get to layer 2 is either for player 101 to invite you to his group, or for player 102 to log in.  You can't just log in player 102 and wind up on layer 3.  You can't just log out and back in and now be on layer 4.
---
But since it's beta, and they want to test how layers function, they relax the rules, or they do something like:
---
    do_login()
---
        player.layer = random( 1, MAX_LAYERS );
---
So now all the beta people freak out because they're able to get on a different layer.  In reality, Blizzard just puts some test stuff in so they can see how layers create, destroy, merge, etc.
---
But nah, it's beta, so lets all have a panic about what we think will break Classic.
---
yeah but i like the jankyness...there's a reason private servers never tweaked balance/specs. Paladin will always be the hard-mode choice that's in the game. The idea of making everything viable and balanced isn't good for the game, retail is the most balanced version of wow and classes aren't unique at all. 
---
What would the stats on viable Pally tanking gear be? How would they be balanced as to not make them overpowered in PvP? Then take into consideration that Paladin is Alliance only.
---
If you want to tank in raids then play warrior or expect to work a lot harder. I don't understand why people have issues with this, the meta for 1.12 has been known for over a decade now.
---
use the waybackmachine
---
I rolled 99 and lost to a 100 in retail vanilla. Still haunts me to this day.
---
Yeah, that's one of the reasons why Wow was so successful to begin with. It was much more accessible to new players, while still maintaining being challenging. They found the perfect balance
---
idk i just thought it would be a funny reaction lol
---
All I gotta say is that there are thousands of people who enter an immersive fantasy world and still choose to play as a human. 
---
Those people are alliance.
---
All alliance must die. 
---
:-)
---
Really, the potential for content in a Vanilla world is endless.  They had so much stuff in the Vanilla code that either got pushed to a later expansion, or still hasn't seen the light of day.  Emerald Dream comes to mind, most of Outland was in the code when the game originally shipped, they just had ran out of development time before a release date was put in stone.
---
I'd love to see what they could offer in an alternate take on a Vanilla timeline, but I'd also love to see basically just a rerelease of the pre-Catacylsm timeline, I want a BC redux so fucking badly it hurts.  I want both, give me a "Classic" timeline and a "Alternate" timeline servers.
---
If it's bugged on the holy reference client then it's still a bug.
---
I've never heard of AQ40 pugs. That's a legitimately difficult instance that has gear checks.
---
I have a feeling OP played a night elf lol...
---
TLDR; Night Elf is the god race!
---
Joana's Horde guide does not have you go to Silverpine Forest, Duskwood, or Deadwind Pass. Maybe learn to read.
---
This is the only QoL suggestion I’ve seen that I can’t come up with a good argument against implementing. Guild banks make a lot of sense. If we’re going to get batch mailing, we should get guild banks. 
---
The only argument I can even come up with is that it would likely necessitate changes to the world (adding some geometry to the bank) that didn’t exist in vanilla. Maybe get around this by having it be an option or tab in the existing bank window.
---
It’s about 5% more on a Tauren lol
---
I think he's just saying the ones at the bottom are the MOST rewarding to win with because they are the worst classes in pvp and therefore are the hardest to win with in pvp.  This list is definitely wrong on so many levels, though.
---
Yeah, this is some thing they'll probably have to change, because its benefiting rogues too much.
---
They were balanced intheir inability to change targets even for non-combat-points skills.
---
If they can now suddenly blind and kick mouseovers and keep CPs on main target, that has got to go.
---
What does it mean by ladder Reset?

My brain says Mage, but my heart tells me Warrior. Been playing since '05, but I've been on and off (retail &amp; private) since '11. My subscription status has changed more times than the both of my parent's relationship statuses (they're both on marriage#3).
---
Previously played classes include: Rogue, Paladin, DK, and Monk. PvP is life, but I want to do everything in Classic this time: rank 14, full raid clears, all the legendaries, max professions (secondary ones too).
---
Mages have always been the stuff of envy for me. The convenience and utility of mages look like huge quality of life features. They're like the rogues of ranged classes and a good mage is a sight to see. Efficient at solo, kiting kings, best aoe farmers. I almost don't see a reason not to roll a Mage.
---
I've always played melee. Warrior is the only plate melee I haven't played in all my time off WoW. Unlike mages, warriors are not convenient. The leveling takes longer than other classes. They get kited hard. Possibly the most gear reliant. But they scale they hardest. Classic warriors are the embodiment of what the classic experience is to me. You start as a weak nobody who seeks the help of others, but eventually you become the powerhouse of the game and people start running to their group when they see you in coming.
---
From what I've seen, both mages and warriors are two of the most popular classes so I'm hoping I'll get some useful feedback on class choice here. So to all the Mages and Warriors reading this post, "Why should I roll your class in Classic?". Thanks for reading and I'll see you in Azeroth.
---
This was never about race but about faction.
---
there was an old video of someone sitting standing and showing that it can be done but i cant find it at the moment, and it was on an npc
---
I believe so but only Blizzard would know
---
I don't think you understand layering... You don't get to pick your layer.  If you want to get into a layer you have to be invited into a group.
---
Even if you able to get that done and invited into layer 1 every time (if the layers even have visible numbers), you are basically admitting that layering is shit and you're only going to get your story by circumventing the system.
---
Yeah, we know it won't happen.
---
But now "vanilla" pservers will have the right data, so I guess it's a win-win?
---
then why blind doesnt share DR with poisons and itself? why they removed the ability to do /sit to proc talents? why gouge doesnt share DR with anything? your argument makes no sense
---
Alliance dont get it?
---
There is no real official documentation of it that I know of. Blizzard themselves were pretty inconsistent in what they called those categories over the years.
---
The fact that they share a DR means they were added to the same category and freezing trap never changed it's category because it never stopped sharing DR with other abilities like polymorph that are in the same category.
---
By that logic you are saying that literally every single interaction you have had in the beta you have cross referenced with some sort of data? Obviously that's not true. What you have done is identify something that you think might be a bug, THEN proceeded to do the research and specifically tell the devs in a bug report what is wrong.
---
Therefore, you could have just reported the bug and left the development to the developers. Just because they aren't patching the beta every time you throw bugs in their face doesnt mean they aren't doing anything. 
---
Does every game these days have to start out with a completely solved, stale, boring meta? Can we not just have the game organically grow for a little while? Classic isn't some crowd sourced indy game private server. Why do you think blizzard invited so few to the beta? Why do you think they prioritized actual vanilla launch day accounts for beta access?
---
Yes. 60s. Not comparable to 100 people all trying to kill a single quest mob.
---
The thing you’ve gotta understand about Vanilla versus Retail was that a single server a community. You played with the same people day in and day out.
---
So when a giant event like the Gates of AW came around, entire servers would band together to race other servers.
---
Then you get funny stories like, I think it was an EU server, a guild holding an entire server for ransom to open the gates. They finished the scepter but refused to ring the gong until the server paid them a few thousand gold. And the GMs didn’t do anything about it because it’s not against the rules to be giant pricks lol
---
Good move.
---
It's because a 1 hander is vastly less rage efficient to cleave with. You CAN try to cleave spam with a 2.8 speed weapon, but it's VERY hard on your rage. And it works. Hell, I am doing it right now with a 23 tauren warrior on a private server (I was screwing around and took wing blade without realizing that there are no BOP 2 handers in wailing caverns). 
---
Cleave spam with a 2.7-2.8 speed 1 hander works. I would argue if you do it, you should sword and board, because the kill time is so much worse already that you need the damage reduction. But it's vastly inferior to even a 3.3 speed 2 hander, let alone a 3.5 speed 2 hander.
---
Explain to me how Horde gets to Swamp of Sorrows?
---
The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt expansion saw the game expand to 218 km^2.
---
I am never offended by swearing unless it’s hateful/racist/sexist/etc. 
---
If it’s people chucking out a few fucks in normal conversation then everything is all good with me (and a whole bunch of people I know).
---
At launch everyone will be in a starting zone. **Everyone.**  
---
Hundreds, possibly thousands, of level 1 toons fighting for mob spawns and quest items. Layering is intended to relax that overcrowding until players spread out into the world and casuals get bored and stop playing.  
---
Once servers stabilize there will be no need for layering and it will be removed.
---
Your question is flawed. Batching doesn't allow you to perform actions after a CC has hit you. It only stretches the time that it takes for the spell to hit you.
---
If you meant to ask "Why should you have a way of countering instant cast spells" the answer is what I explained in my previous post. In correct amount, spell batching increases skillcap. You have yet to explain how the scenario I explained before (predictively vanishing blind/cheap shot) is NOT an increase of skillcap, you are just repeating how it's not skill. That is unless you are actually insisting on nobody being able to learn to ever predictively vanish these spells and they are all just total flukes.
---
Can solve that with a deviate fish or nogenfrogger elixir
---
Sit proc talents was fixed in vanilla. If you knew anything about vanilla you would know it was fixed then after a paladin one shot a raid boss stacking reckoning. They changed it so sitting crits don’t proc talents and added a cap to reckoning.
---
I plan on leveling a few characters but to start off I'm between Rogue, Warlock, or Hunter. It's going to depend which character my leveling partner is doing so I can team up with her. We're both role-players so we're not planning on looking for amazing duo combinations, just who is going to be the best to play beside each other. We both have a lot of free time so we're planning on enjoying our leveling together and if we get bored of one toon to jump to another.
---
I'm definitely not a purist. I'm more like a.. noflyerer.
---
I remember even leading a raid like that in the WotLK prepatch to get all the leader kills, but honestly I've never seen a city raid throughout vanilla-TBC, let alone a successful one. It happened all the time in WotLK though.

When Classic drops on August 27th a few friends of mine and I will be starting a progression raiding guild. We're looking for fun, serious, like minded individuals to slay dragons with!
---
 A little history about us, we've been playing since WoW released in 2004, and have dabbled in both PVE and PVP over the years. With the relaunch of Classic we'll be able to progress more efficiently and effectively than the first time. Our ultimate goal is to have a high yield of boss kills, loot, and of course enjoyment! 
---
If you're interested, let us know what class you'll play, experience level, and fill us in on why you'd be a good fit for the team! Thank you for your time, and please ask any questions you have!

1. Show up on time with consumables, add-ons, and appropriate specs/gear. 
---
2. Have fun, Be patient, tolerant, and mature. We're in this together!

**Raid Loot:**  Loot council is a relatively simple way to distribute loot. Whenever an item is involved in the loot system, a group of individuals decides who gets the item. Ideally, this group of individuals takes into consideration several different factors, ranging from attendance, performance, size of upgrade, and attitude. It's worth noting that Loot Council systems are the most popular method of loot distribution in world-class raiding guilds.

I mowed the lawn for free for the monthly sub. Was worth it!
---
Weeks?  Months?  I don't think so.  What if the population doesn't decline?
---
It's so sad how little regard people have for the vanilla experience, and how little understanding they have of what makes the game great.
---
I’m not sure if I’ll play rogue or hunter. I like the idea of stealth attack with the rogue but I also like the bow &amp; pet combo for hunter. Any advice on who’s better? I don’t care much to raiding(it’s fun but not a must for me)but I do enjoy pvp.

Warlock is a fantastic gold-farming class in vanilla if you do it right. We can blast through DME like nobody's business and we are the eternal bane of furlbogs.
---
I think you're complaining about a different issue. I don't think anybody has much of a problem with 1-20 being layered briefly to prevent what you're talking about.
---
What people have a problem with is long term layering across the whole world for the foreseeable future. Blizz doesn't even seem to have a concrete exit strategy for layering, just hoping that players stop playing is an absolute joke.
---
Username relevant?
---
Yes.  People have posted screenshots of beta users spamming chat trying to get invites to layers streamers were in.
---
Is there a list of benefits for rep with all of these factions?? I'd love that!
---
I love being an asshole on my rogue toons. Always haved.
---
Fantasy wise, a dwarf priest takes the cake for me - Especially with shadow and mind control. I'm hesitant because I've never loved healing and will inevitably end up doing just that in raids
---
Locks are great mechanics, ease of leveling, and I want to do the demon quests. I rolled a lock main in bc and have always been a lock main
---
If it wasn't caught for several months, how is it game-breaking?
---
its\*
---
You said.
---
&gt;The Witcher 3
---
Since we're including expansions here. Let's include TBC, Wrath, Cata, MOP, Legion, and BFA then?
---
I didn't play during release, but I did play on the release of several quite big private servers and it was fantastic if you got in early and saw the sea of people. But most often you would just sit in queues. On one server the queues reached 50k with 13k online and it stayed like that for two weeks and there were still serious queues during primetime a month after. Know what's awesome? When the MT gets a random disconnect and gets put into a queue so the entire raid has to wait for an hour until the tank comes back. And that's a fucking private server. Classic will be absolutely retardedly big on launch and if we're only getting a handful of servers per region it's definitely not gonna work. 
---
The server split thing is a good idea but the main flaw is the inflexibility of the system. We don't know which shards will drop quickly and which will flourish. So we might end up with one shard being overpopulated and another being a ghost server. Merging them would create queues and keeping them split would both separate the communities entirely where some people expected to eventually end up on the same server as everyone else and the ghost server would stay a ghost server and slowly die off.
---
&gt;If you knew anything about vanilla you would know it was fixed then after a paladin one shot a raid boss stacking reckoning. They changed it so sitting crits don’t proc talents and added a cap to reckoning.
---
They just added a cap to reckoning, so you're wrong. You could still proc talents by doing /sit.
---
Not one to start fights but likes to be alive and possible kill. Had hunter, druid and warrior on radar. Love trolls. 
---
From the picks I guess druid is only one like that. Warlock sounds something that can also do that.
---
Awesome video dude, I was the 20th like haha. 
---
Great content and narration. It seems some people have been commenting about your voice but I think it’s great. It reminds me of Musashi! https://youtu.be/g8r7A7NLTW4
---
Anyway, keep up the good work. I’m going to watch your Paladin video next.
---
You aren't wrong in your read or your opinion. I share your opinion and myself am I min maxer. I just believe the beta is for testing bugs, not solving metas.
---
Yeah it's weird shadow being so high when it's only good in 1v1 and world pvp.
---
Yes it does allow that. Without batching you literally get hit by who acted first.
---
When you into duct batching it allows whoever hit you first to be hit by something you did **after** the fact.
---
It doesn't increase the bloody skillcap either. It can and does often happen by complete bloody accident. Even the blue post regarding the choice to reintroduce it referred to it as "common" and "somewhat reliable"
---
It requires more skill to have to suffer the consequences of what has hit you first than it does giving you a window where you not only don't suffer the consequences, but can benefit from it even though you were slower.
---
Where do you even draw the line with such nonsense. If I increase the window to five seconds does that increase the skillcap? Of course not.
---
Swimming around the Cape of Stranglethorn, obviously.
---
I wiped a ZG raid on literal trash mobs once because my game crashed mid fight and I lost aggro.
---
How would you prove it’s bugged on there? Where is the proof it’s a bug at all. Freezing trap was added to the DR list in 1.10. What if it was added to the same DR category as scatter and changed (fixed as the bug claimed say) later.
---
I like your name, friend.
---
I'm not trying to be a pedant nor an asshole to you; I beg your forgiveness if I am. I'm missing where the beta has to do with bringing back the forums
---
And I believe it has been said many times it will stop in phase 2.
---
I don't like it either, I'd love it to be disabled as soon as like 2 weeks max, but I'd rather take layering over the "starter zone clusterfuck".
---
Yeah T1/T2/T3 all are beautifull. But T1 and T2 aren't bis for warlock and i like to be " optimized " xD
---
You da man
---
Ion has come out on record to state that layering will last for anything between a few weeks to Phase 2 (there is more evidence relating to the former). They follow the data very closely, they will definitely know when they can remove it without impacting player experience, I'm sure. Every step of the way, the classic team have shown their competence and this is another feather in the cap for them as far as I'm concerned. Sure, it would be nice to have no layering but this really does work for both new and old players in the earliest stages of the game.  
---
I honestly hope layering is dispersed by weeks 2-4 but this is massively promising imho.
---
No you couldn’t. I’ll dig up the info in it later where people talk about the change date stamped from vanilla era.
---
I don't think people are upset but the list is incredibly incorrect and you can't even make such a list, you need to separate cetegories.
---
Why would shadow be so high for example when it's only good for 1v1, for BGs and team fights it's not that great.
---
Yeah I'm fairly sure they started on private servers and the people who join those pugs often do so because they can't attend their guild's main raid for whatever reason. We had one mage who could only be there 75% on two raid days. Essentially every other Sunday ge couldn't be there. So he started hosting his own AQ40 pug every other week and it became quite successful. Iirc they actually downed CT a couple of times, but this was way after Naxx was out so people were quite geared.
---
Calm the fuck down Satan
---
A literal interpretation of the patch notes has them imply that Freezing Trap DRs only with itself, by intent. Other mentions of DR note the category of DR. Compare:
---
* Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns. 
---
versus
---
* Impact - The stun effect's duration no longer diminishes or is diminished by controlled stun abilities and spells (e.g. Cheap Shot, Hammer of Justice, Charge etc.).
---
* All Confusion effects have been renamed Disorient effects. This includes Blind, Scatter Shot, etc.
---
Moreover, this patch note unambiguously clarifies that Scatter Shot belonged to the Confusion/Disorient category, which included Blind.
---
Are you saying that Freezing Trap DRs with Polymorph? If that's true, and if Freezing Trap DRs with Scatter Shot, then all four of these CCs must DR with each other for them to all be part of the same category.
---
If Freezing Trap doesn't DR with Poly, then it still must DR with Blind for the behavior to be internally consistent.
---
Wouldn’t mind a focus frame
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but it means that you still get skill points as if your Herbalism was 15 points lower. So that means for example you can still get a skill point for peacebloom at 65 instead of it turning grey at 50. This does make it quite a bit easier to level herbalism. 
---
P. S. I made up the peacebloom numbers. I'm too lazy to actually look it up.
---
Imagine Blizz assumes they will lose 75% of population in 2 months.  They decide 3k people is just right, so they make servers for 12k people on launch over ~4 layers.  First of all, have fun with a 12k person AH, having a 25% chance of running into the same person again when you normally would have, and people disappearing and reappearing and abusing the system to reap 4x rewards.  Anyways.
---
What if the population only declines 50%?  Now you have a server that's still twice the size as intended, and layering could remain for months, maybe longer.  And that's not even that crazy of a scenario.  I mean fuck, population could even grow, or not drop nearly as fast as they imagine.
---
Although ironically layering making the game shittier might encourage a population drop so you might have nothing to worry about.  You can't have overpopulation issues in a game if no one wants to play it. *Blizzard taps head*
---
Ah right, yeah that's quite practical.
---
no fun allowed
---
This is why you never stop PVPing. Pinning your progressions/enjoyment on loot rolls and DKP is the fastest way to kill a fun game.
---
It was like that for about a year not a short period of time. A lot of classes were different in earlier patches than 1.12. Hunters were not broken OP pre 1.12.
---
Hello fellow arthropod themed account!
---
I was pre/early teens when vanilla was out; looking back my parents begrudgingly payed the sub but I think over the long term it saved them a fuck ton as I hardly wanted anything else but to play WoW up until Cata's release.
---
Well I certainly would not have expected this detailed response. I will pass this on to my other friend rolling Druid with me.
---
lmao, looks like you're the one that doesnt know anything about vanilla and never played paladin back in the day, right?
---
Hail Hydra!
---
Vanilla wow will always be special to me as my first mmo thanks to game cards. I did have the money as allowance for the monthly fee, what I didn’t have was a credit card. I wanted to play FF11 back then but it was only through credit card and my parents always thought that was shady so they wouldn’t let me have it. But along cake wow with game cards and I could buy those at the store with cash. I was able to play it!
---
Then I realized my computer was more than shit and wouldn’t run it so I couldn’t really dive into the game until a year later, but that’s another story.
---
tens of thousands of items need to get turned in before the gong can be rung to end the event, not really something 1 or a few people can do in any reasonable timeframe.
---
because everybody who rings the gong within 10 hours of the first, you can farm multiple scepters for multiple scarab lords.  the safest way to ensure nobody trolls the gong at like 1am or before server maintenance is to not finish the turn in event so that the gong is unringable until the group decides they're ready for everybody to ring it
---
I’ve forgotten more about vanilla than you know son.
---
90% set on maining a mage, andalso gonna level another toon with my friends which will probably be a shaman/paladin depending on faction.. but I also like priests and warlocks.
---
I really like healing but being stuck in healer spec or having to pay 50g when I want to kill stuff outside of group content sounds horrible, which warlock wouldn't have to deal with.. but then warlocks have threat problems, and WotF problems on alliance or lack of salvation on horde...
---
Yeah I feel like set bonuses could get less played specs more relevance without being as drastic as burning crusade changes. Also very fun for those spec to finally obtain the correct item or set bonus to have a huge effect on their class
---
See that's the problem friend, Blizz have been really wishy washy about the actual length of layering.
---
First they said "a couple of weeks' then in another instance they said disabled by phase 2.
---
Which is it Blizz? 2 weeks or 6 months? Bit of a fucking difference
---
Raiding itself is much more fun than getting items imo. Especially when it's a farm raid because you just talk shit and joke around in disc.
---
It was settled in court, and it goes much deeper than that. The company ended up banned from taking public contracts for colleges in the city and any time someone criticized the company’s means of doing business or workmanship, they would claim the client was making racist remarks. They did this twice that was documented. I did some digging and made a big write up on here before.
---
People had more than one well geared toon back in the day- it just requires a lot of time. I've heard speedy folks can level to 60 in 120 hours, but 200+ might be more realistic.  Then dozens of hours to get geared up and ready for endgame. Will you have that kind of time?  I recommend focusing on one first to 60 .
---
Enemy cast bar, dot timer, auto dismount. Yes I know there’s an addon for all of this but the blizzard one is more accurate.
---
I meant i was hoping they would deliver what people want, wow classic true to the design philosophy of vanilla but not vanilla warts included.
---
I’m pretty sure at this point he was just trolling. Either way that’s what you get when trying to help someone out.
---
This is correct. We call them DE alts.
---
Raiding as a healer, pally vs priest.
---
Anyone want to try to sell me on one over the other?
---
Shaman has a cookie cutter 30 ele 21resto spec that you can do PvP/PvE with, damage or heals.
---
Not the only ones. 7 8 9 11 are also just modified screenshots.
---
Damn dude, why do you have to be so hostile?
---
More... I need MORE.
---
Freezing Trap DRed in 1.10. It wasn't added to an explicit DR list in 1.10.
---
&gt; How would you prove it’s bugged on there?
---
That's the point. You can't prove if it's a bug or not based only on reference client behavior. All that proves is that is how the game ran in patch 1.12. Every bug or not-bug of 1.12 would be present in the client.
---
My dad paid mine as long as I did well in school. Never have I been a better student than back then...
---
Maybe if classic is popular enough. I want it all also lol. Even with keeping a server that never moves past naxx. I don’t expect to play it forever but almost more for the history of video games. It would nice to be able to always have the ability to go back to the original days just as they were
---
Nice, so a player who always yells for #NoChanges now wants a change to make his hunter work the way he's used to on some dodgey ass private server? No.
---
I though you made that out of scratch. So i though you just made a mistake on the image instead of being lazy! &gt;:D
---
Again with the assumptions.
---
Oh.  Right.
---
To be honest, if you don't get into this stuff, and you intend to solo 1-60, which is what this guide is for, I don't know why you would roll a warrior. This is what warrior IS. it's nerding out over your gear, and being rewarded for it.
---
I apologize aswell kind human. You are missing some context. OP and I are also currently going back and forth. He said to me essentially: How am I supposed to know what a bug is without the old forums. Maybe you could scroll a bit if you want further info.
---
You are right, it doesnt have anything to do with the beta until he brought the beta up to me.
---
Everyone helped b/c the Vanilla wow community was not the same group of people that currently play the game.
---
Farming ending game Vanilla content is to this day, the most fun I've ever had playing a videogame.
---
I've always loved the affliction image. That windmill is so awesome.
---
Enough of these threads please.
---
Apparently so.  I don't understand why everybody is being so dramatic about it.  I'd much rather have some extra layering going on than be lvl 20 with 2.5 days played.
---
[Here you go!!](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm) 
---
Looks like we’re both wrong and right. You can’t generate procs of reckoning via npc crits or auto attack crits while sitting. However ability crits will. (I recall this being changed all around and will find the other info about that later as this isn’t that source).
---
A Tauren on a wolf looks incredibly badass, so that's absolutely a goal for me with classic.
---
But how much revenue can you get with a 10:04 video discussing this?
---
This doesn't prove anything.
---
Freezing trap shared the same DR as other long cc’s (sap, fear, polymorph) in 1.7.0.
---
In 1.10 it was also noted to be added to the DR list (never stated what list) so its very possible it was added to the same list as scatter in 1.10 (therefore not a bug) and changed (fixed like the bug claimers say) later in TBC.
---
A buddy of mine shared this video \[credit YT channel: perplexity\]. I don't know if this has been shared yet, but this needs to be brought to addressed.
---
I played a Paladin for 99% of my time with Vanilla and Nokrai is correct.
---
So how do you get to

$800,000 was *just* the judgement against him and his dad for the shoddy construction work. They were also sued by their insurance companies over sureties to the tune of over a million dollars. The court cases are viewable, I just don’t have the links handy.
---
Maybe!
---
Lol ok buddy.
---
Except it is Capri Sun, tastes the same too. But if you look at the nutritional facts, the ingredients are different—not that you knew exactly what the ingredients were in the OG lunchables.
---
You’re pretty optimistic on how quickly people will get to 60, eh?
---
Or that Diremaul will even be available...
---
Thanks! But yah I laugh at those comments to I don’t care haha.
---
I can remember several times paying for those pre paid monthly cards in straight change that I’d saved up that entire month. One time the bag broke while I was paying...  my brother acted like he didn’t know me and walked away.  He came back 2 minutes later asking if I needed assistance. Hands down one of the funnier memories I have with him and that game.  Can’t wait to fire up with him and get back into it all come August!
---
He’s a nuts mage &gt; all fan. Just ignore him.
---
Is that frostmourne?
---
No need for proof I provided some and it proves nothing.
---
Not really, but rag being dropped on 670 doesn't sound as good.
---
New models would ruin everything.
---
The exact patch notes are:
---
Patch 1.7
---
* Freezing Trap now shares the same duration in pvp as other long-duration forms of crowd control (ie: polymorph, fear, sap).
---
Patch 1.9 
---
* Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.
---
Taken in this order, those patch notes are nonsensical.
---
You don’t get layered randomly though and if you invite them you will join the same shard. The only situation this matters in is if you invite them they hop a layer and then you disband and make a new group with different people on a different layer who also are on CD and can’t join.
---
I still have that in my bank, right next to my heart of hakkar.
---
SM and RFD shouldn't be any trouble but I'm not sure what of value drops, other than disenchanting materials.  BRD might be a better bet but I think you need a buddy or two for that.  
---
DME might be doable as well if you get enough gear.  That might be the most lucrative.  Lasher packs ftw!
---
I can definitely believe they did it purposely. I had always thought they meant it that way, but then didn't like the result and added it to the tbc changes. So I expected it to be that way for classic.
---
Either way, it isnt game breaking or as bad as people say. It will shift the meta as far as pvp builds go, though. Entrapment is so good, especially when you can't just spam scatter/trap
---
Hah! Fair enough
---
Alphy!
---
Of course, but if they post exactly how the system will work, then it'll make it too easy for anybody to abuse it.
---
You can do both of course. Classic will be out for a long time and you can always level an alt on the other faction. 
---
I would also consider this; is the leveling experience more worth than the hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of hours you'll put in at level 60 over the years. For me it's really not. For instance imagine it takes about 10 days /played to reach 60. That leaves a lot of time to do dungeons, muck about with professions, rp, world PvP and all that good stuff. That's 240 hours to 60. If you then play only 10 hours a week, already in the first year you will have spent more time at 60 than during leveling. And if Classic has a lifespan of 2-3 years then your time at 60 massively outweighs your time leveling. 
---
So I would definitely think about life at level 60 some more. Blessing of Salvation is 100% the reason why I choose Alliance.
---
&gt;No more slowly reaching your goal you either get the drop then win the roll or you don't and you just wasted an hour.
---
This is a horrible mentality to have in a Classic WoW raid environment.
---
No, because when the new models came out we were told they were optional and that we could toggle between them. Guess what... they went back on their word and now in BFA we are stuck with the new models all the time. #nochanges
---
I'm watching that movie again tonight now, thanks
---
So no way of proving it’s a bug.. got it.
---
Might as well roll Horde if you don't want to use it
---
Yes. As far as I know Repentance is also part of that category.

much like your comment. and now mine. look what you made me do!
---
8 days will get you through the worst part of warrior leveling with heals. You're good to solo after that.
---
I find hunter to be quite annoying, even if strong while levelling. Bag management is a hassle, you give up one bag but also need to fill another with meats for your pet and other stuff. Your deadzone is annoying to deal with. Your pet will often spaz out and pull lots of stuff unless you micro it, which is itself annoying. You need a ton of macros to do things like feign + freezing trap. Swapping stances is actually annoying IMO, monkey for melee, hawk for damage, cheetah for movement happens a lot more than you think and I just CBA honestly. 
---
Rogue has a real fun set of RPG mechanics that dont get in the way like a hunter does. Stealth is just great in PvE and PvP as well.
---
I'm torn between playing a paladin or priest in a support role. I have a group of rl friends that will be playing with me, so I'll pretty much always have a group. I'm leaning towards paladin cause I played a priest in the original vanilla. I kinda want some utility though, and people are saying that priest has more utility than pally, but pallys have buffs and bubble and cleanse, so I'm not really sure yet.
---

In my experience in BFA you get a zone starting quest then either traverse the zone with some main npc sending you through all the quest hubs usually clockwise or counter clockwise in the zone you clear the zone boom you can start the next. There’s no quest that uses multiple zones to accomplish. All the quest are either kill stuff pickup stuff or kill names dude. As a tank player I would mindlessly just quest by aoe clearing areas then picking up quest items.
---
I reserved lots of things in vanilla when i was building a party. Most of the time people were running the instance just to earn gold from large brilliant shards.
