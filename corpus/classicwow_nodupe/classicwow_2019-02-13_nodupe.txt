You wouldn't have Blizzard in the first place without capitalism. You probably wouldn't have food either.

Fucking retards need to just give us no loot trading over that garbage system they implemented

I really don't know how or why people still lick this companies boots.

Mobile Edition

Whole-hardheartedly agree with this assessment as Classic/Vanilla WoW was always an adventure. You couldn't even sit in a major city without occasionally getting killed by an enemy player, plague, or kited mob and the fact that we all felt the same struggle to stay alive, along with the community/forced interaction, made the game great!
---
Shamans are fun to level though never level as resto since you can't really kill. 
---

---
Elemental has really good nuke ability but ooms fast. Like really fast. Also you only need one set of gear while since you'll already have plenty of intellect to heal.
---
Enhancement is fun once you get windfury, but that happens in the 30s, before that there really is no reason to spec into it. I would still say elemental is the better choice but windfury really is a blast when it procs so it's up to you at that point.
---
Tldr, shaman levels well. Elemental is better pick.
---
I hate what's happening. But this is fallout from having a bad quarter and having the community reinforce they are upset. Blizz didn't perform as well. As they had hoped so they are restructuring the company.
---
It's pretty simple, blizz games are dying so they are cutting off the redundant positions. It's upsetting that they have failed as a company. 
---
I miss Mike... fck Activision
---
alliance is better at defending though, so it might come from that. shadowmeld being the prime "surprise, motherfucker!" ability, but perception is also there.

Mobile Erection 
---
Pet aggro has a huge range as it‚Äôs often a level below you, and it feels like every hunter has no idea you can put pet on passive mode
---
I agree. Do you think the people laid off will have problems finding similar paying jobs?
---
Someone's angry over literally zero information.  Maybe you should go back to the anonymous sub-reddit where you can stew over conspiracies with your tin foil hat.  You, I, and everyone else has NO idea what Diablo Immortal is going to do.  It's nothing major.  It's a stop-gap game that they are releasing until Diablo 4 is done.  All blizzard is doing is diversifying their interests.  
---
There's a saying:  If you don't take a slice of the market, someone else will.  Blizzard is a VERY late player to the mobile games market.  **The developers and non-executives probably fought as long as they could to discourage entering the mobile games market because yes...it is glutted with P2W trash games; and they understand that by entering the market it is guilt by association.**  That doesn't mean every game on mobile is P2W trash.  There's plenty that are 100% enjoyable free2play.  Others require small one-time purchases for relatively high value content (for example XCOM:EW)  Using broad sweeping comments about "shit-ass p2w mobile games" and then turning around and LIVING YOUR ENTIRE LIFE ON YOUR PHONE THROUGH APPS is probably the most hypocritical thing ever.  And don't fucking deny that you have probably a dozen or more almost useless apps on your phone.
---
But go ahead, continue to make stupidly wild grandstanding statements about shit you know nothing about. Fucking reddit kids.  
---
‚ÄúWe are no longer developing this already-developed game‚Äù
---
Although I see where you're coming from with this I feel like its in bad taste to terminate/lay off the people are your customer base knows best and are virtually on the front line improving customer experience. 
---
But then again it's hard to cut anyone at that point. The best bet would be to cut over paid executives, but we all know that's not happening :/ 
---
It is. EA absorbed Vivendi over 10 years ago, Blizzards parent company, they are pretty much inseparable at this point, especially after most of the figureheads have left, there are noone left to fight for a separation.
---
I am fine with paying subscription actually. Well I dont agree that this is a modern model, however I like to pay for a server if that gurantees it stays up. That the only reason why I never tried private servers albeit a few hours... I dont want my progress to get lost.
---
However do you think I have to pay for the game? I had a closed beta key and immediatly after bought the game.. however since i haven played on an account I own (tried legion but was unplayable but thats a different story) I am not willing to purchase the game again. Subscription? Fine! but I am not going to pay upfront for the same game again..
---
Basically.
---
Hmmm I jsut think I wont play classic. Wish you all luck for Summer.
---
Lol relax. Your talking as if Naxx geared players are common. Naxx isn‚Äôt introduced till super late and even then gear was rare
---
Not just EU, they have a Sydney office and I‚Äôm guessing a pretty big Seoul one, too. These will all be hit.
---
Healing isn't really a performance race like DPS is. Druids have slower and less efficient heals, so they get less heals off, but they still contribute just fine. The healers who get to the top of the charts are the ones who can 'heal snipe' the best - but that's essentially just showing off. Druids will definitely be helping keeping alive, which is the important thing, in addition to providing utilities priests, paladins, etc can't. 
---
Beyond raid healing, druids are great in PVP and solo content. You don't compare a feral druid to rogue based soley on raw damage output, because a rogue can't also do ranged DPS, heal, or shift to mitigate damage and has much less mobility, all of which are super relevant outside of raids.
---
What is your solution then?  Seize the means of video game production and have the state produce all our entertainment?
---
Well said.
---
Truly a shell of its former self. Sad to see.
---
Everyone is entitled and thinks they are owed something.
---
I would consider WoW Classic to just fall under the umbrella of "World of Warcraft" and for this reason it's likely not being viewed as its own "thing". It's simply a server option that current subscribers will be able to elect.
---
Until we get an official update on Classic's development, I'll sssume they are on schedule as planned for a summer release.
---
Makes sense if you think about it. The role of the 'community manager' would logically be to, well, manage the community. The community as a whole is at it's most anti-blizz state it's probably ever been. Doesn't seem like a very good job 'managing the community' on paper. (I realize he was actually one of the best CMs at community and widely considered to have done a good job, but if you look at it from a corporate point of view, probably the logic they used).
---
I mean people could intentionally get a 100ping to achieve this then.
---
Fuck Capitalism
---
Warrior main, hunter alt. If history repeats itself my hunter will never step foot into a dungeon or raid because needing other people is for the weak, like my warrior. Also nobody wants a hunter because apparently hitting the passive button on your pet and /assist -ing the tank is too much work.
---
Actually a scary accurate metaphor.
---
The point is they did NOT need to lay them off. Its just corporate bullshit speak.
---
THey give a corporate suit 15 mil, but then cut actual people who engage with the community.
---
Also if you think a CM's job isn't valuable then you have never, and I mean ever, worked in any sort of CM position or even remotely understand what they did/supposed to do.
---
A CM can take a community from pitch forks to tea parties. They are the bridge between the players and the developers. It isn't like they just say random fluff.
---
The whole point of the position is to relay what the community wants and their concerns to the devs, and also to explain why the devs are doing certain things to the community.
---
He actually did his job, as much as he could. It was clear he loved the game, his job, and the community.
---
He is the EXACT type of person that old blizzard would have supported and helped them grow their career.
---
We're in the negative at this point.
---
/me looks up from Scholo Pally tanking
---
Is anyone confident they'll operate Classic for even a year?  I'm not. 
---
/me sighs, shakes head, pulls next group with boomerang...can't wait for tbc to land this summer. 
---
I always played with my pet on passive and I always dismissed it when jumping off ledges. That little fucker still managed to pull agro when I least expected it and wipe my party on several occasions. 
---
It's sad isn't it? I grew up playing their games. Diablo 2 and WoW are in my top 5 of all time. It's really a shame.
---
You realize they have been together since Wrath right?
---
I don't understand why people think this is a recent thing.
---
This isn‚Äôt yithesens is it?
---
What athlete is making a billion dollars?
---
Sadly, it is probably for the best to keep expectations low - since it is highly likely they will end up ruining it if not at launch but somewhere further down the line. And that will help prevent you from being let down as much. They're way too out of sync with what people actually want and seem to only care about what will drive and retain subscriptions. Although I would be pleasantly surprised if they actually nail it, don't get me wrong.

5: Acceptance ‚Äì "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it; I may as well prepare for it."
---
You're convincing the wrong person here.
---
They (Blizzard) are interested in cutting costs to increase short-term profitability. Customer satisfaction (as you described here) isn't what they really give a shit about at the moment... see Diablo Immortals. Therefore, they see CMs as expendable. Do I agree? No, but I'm not the one in charge.
---
You sound fun at parties
---
EDIT. Not that you asked, or that anyone will find the edit later. But I also added how many games it will take roughly if games are lost 50% of the time
---
It's the result of a long streak of horrible decisions where the company destroyed everything they built, this was long coming, it's not a new thing, they've wasted every single IP they had over the last 10 years or so and every single core blizzard player stuck with them, praying and hoping that things would somehow get back to old normal blizzard.  
---
  You can only disappoint your fans so much, hearthstone was a massive waste of potential where most people hate it or don't care about it nowadays, overwatch balance was always a mess and its low skill ceiling and casual design makes the game incredibly boring after a short amount of time, hence why the game was everywhere on release then it basically banished from peoples minds.  
---
  Wow was on its deathbed for a long time now, hots suffered a somewhat similar problem to overwatch and when they started working on it a bit more it was far too late, diablo 3 missed the mark on what made the first 2 so good, sc2 was good but custom mode scene was killed by them before it even arrived and expansions were dubious quality.  
---
  Blizz was on an actual bubble that a few big hitters like hs and ow created, they went from their regular games like wc2, sc, wc3 being their front runners to wow making money from them, then it was replaced by hs, then it was replaced by OW, all while the other games and IPs suffered, however, their horrible decisions quickly started poking holes and now, the bubble is finally fully bursting, it was an unsustainable move.  
---
You got an inheritance!

Then you blew it on a damn car.

Classic is literally free DLC for WoW.
---
Even the most cynical [investor analysts](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4237543-activision-blizzards-secret-weapon?amp_js_v=0.1) agree that: 
---
&gt; ‚Äú... the success (or failure) of Classic will not single handedly transform the company in a radical way.‚Äù
---
woah ok
---
1) i have literally never seen a player complain that the grind for allied races wasn't long enough. i HAVE seen people complain that spending weeks doing time-gated world quests to unlock an allied race is bs and to be honest? it really is, because there are one of two options here: 1) you take blizzard at face value when they market allied races as bfa's ''new race'' and wonder why you need to do a long grind to unlock them, unlike every other new race in the game. 2) you see it as a purely cosmetic thing, and then realize that if this was any other MMO, a LOT of these would, in fact, have been added to the original races as customization options. it's not because people are lazy and don't want to do anything, it's because using a boring class to do boring world quests in a laggy world just so you can unlock a recolored race with mediocre lore, and then have to go through the shitty leveling experience again is, shockingly, not worth it
---
2) the author specifically stated that the game outside of high end raiding/mythic plus and competitive pvp is boring, bland, and shallow, which is true and is a point worth mentioning when everybody who doesn't buy a boost has to go through bad content to get to content that may be interesting and fun to do
---
my first character was a blood elf hunter, because I was a moron when I started. my first mount was an overgrown chicken. it was an *overgrown motherfucking chicken*.
---
Really? THIS is what made you uninstall retail?
---
Communicating with the customer takes time and money. They want us to shut up and fork up the cash.
---
&gt; they're hoping that they're able to portray its success as a success for WoW in general
---
Yeah, pretty much. Classic is literally just a free DLC game mode for WoW‚Äîthe same way the Diablo I implementation in Diablo III was.
---
Arms warriors here, I had a survial hunter need the destroyer of worlds sword and he won...... said melee hunters need it more then a arms warriors since they do more dps anyways with melee. Luckily on 2nd run it did drop again and I got it (other warrior passed since he knew that sword should of been mine lol)
---
Why is that a good thing?
---
[removed]
---
Wow, buying back their own stock?
---
That's huge. It means less pressure to mollify stockholders who have no direct connection with the company. This is inarguably a good thing.
---
I was about 11, back in Vanilla playing my brother's account. 
---
In comparing these two classes only, I would say the major drawback to a mage is that they have about 6 or 7 specs that are optimal for a specific purpose (pve frost, pve fire, frost pvp, frost aoe farming, arcane pvp, etc) and you will be respeccing alot more (50 gold each time) if you plan to min/max (you will, at the very minimum, be required to be spec'd optimally for raid content).
---
Locks have 2 specs for pve and 2 for pvp, and you can (somewhat reliably) pvp in your SM/Ruin pve spec. It's alot easier as a lock to transition from pve to pvp on the fly without feeling that you're overly gimping yourself.
---
If you remove economics from the equation I'd go mage all day.
---
Tier 2 Hunter does more than mc....
---
It's genius and very well may end up saving retail. I'm returning solely for Classic, but I'll have access to my old 85s, and I'll inevitably reinstall retail just to check in on those characters and reminisce at least once. I'd be lying if I said that wasn't their chance to pitch me the game. And I would never consider resubbing to retail as is - that's how powerful an opportunity this is for them.
---
what is that expression?
---
Shit didn't hit the fan though, they clearly said that it was a record year but that's not enough. They don't just want more money, they want all the money.
---
... well alright then
---
It's impacting hundreds of people's livelihoods
---
and, to be fair, night elves are just badly mutated trolls. I mean, they *actually* are just [badly mutated trolls.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Night_elf#Emergence_of_the_night_elves)
---
This is the dumbest copout that keeps being repeated for some reason.
---
Yes, a mode of production that's (barely, if even that in the long term) functional does end up producing things. Thats kinda the point. Just happened to be that capitalism is the widespread one atm. The viability of change / using other systems is a completely separate discussion. 
---
I'd even argue that the nature of capitalism leads to artists creating great art *despite* profit-driven production, not because of it. The gaming industry is kinda fucked up at the moment because of a profitable market for heavily monetized games. Also, AAA are incredibly safe and rarely innovate because it's too much of a risk. 
---
Passion is what creates great work, not desire for money. And you can tell wow devs were really passionate from what you hear about classic wow development now that some of the old devs are talking about it. (the wow diary, for example) Plus, they took a huge risk making an and it probably wasn't the best financial decision based on their knowledge at the time. 
---
Yeah there‚Äôs no easy answer. But devs are the core employees. Anything else is frills
---
Whats less than nothing? The "blue posts" have given us literally nothing to talk about beyond "hey a dev mentioned Classic is still happening" 
---

Also lmao the us had bread lines less than a century ago.

It *has* hit the fan dude.

Saying it‚Äôs a record year changes nothing. It‚Äôs their execs trying to spin.

Look at the stock price. Look at how bungie split. Look at poor blizzard numbers.

ATVI is in deep shit right now, and what‚Äôs worse is EA, their biggest competitor, stock has recovered and is doing decent.

Shit did not hit the fan though, it's the exact opposite.  They made the most money ever last year.  They can afford more than what they're spending on now

If it's on a PvP server, I'd go mage, PvE, would go warlock.

It‚Äôs neither.

Classic WoW is just another DLC ‚Äúretro‚Äù game mode for World of Warcraft. 
---
This sub has this understandable, but still incredibly naive notion that Classic is way more than it will be. 
---
Trust me, I love Classic and have been playing pservers for years, but lets not circlejerk ourselves this much. Classic is not a new, major property or push for the company. It‚Äôs not something you bring up in an earnings call. 
---
As if nobody has ever gotten fired before lol. The average age of this sub is really getting exposed in this comments section.

Firing the only guy who was communicating with the community means they don't give a fuck about communicating with the community. Which means they also don't give a fuck about making changes to their product and not telling us. Incoming cash shop for Classic.
---
Looks like it
---
First things first, he got laid off, which just shows where their real priorities are. Second of all, what's to defend about Blizzard lately? Between Diablo mobile, the hemorrhaging of long-time executives who made a huge difference (Morhaime, Metzen, Brode, etc.), the increased number of microtransactions, I see Blizzard/Activision heading in a very negative direction. I can rant on here but that doesn't matter; the only thing that is going to make them change is not spending my money on their products.
---
If you think they're retarded you're incredibly naive. The people making these decisions don't give a fuck about video games and they don't give a fuck about you. Every person they laid off is another % added to their bonus this year.
---
I was probably 17. The free trial got me. 
---
did I miss something?
---
Private servers are the only way to go.
---
I mean, it's not exactly the shareholders fault. I own a few shares and I'm just as pissed off as the rest of you.
---
It's the fault of Blizzard as a company having delusions of appeasing shareholders forever by somehow growing infinitely, and of Bobby Kotick's greedy asshole never being satisfied with what wealth he has.
---
Sorry, that wasn't phrased very clearly.  Some athletes make $30 million per year.
---
Problem is, ninjas will never get caught loot trading to friends. The only way people would know they were friends is if they type to each other in party chat. They‚Äôre prob on discord anyway not typing 
---
Yeah a 15-20 minute run that gets 3+ quests done is way more xp/m than grinding or questing and often gives a large item upgrade that increases xp/m while questing.
---
Yeah....blame capitalism.... brilliant. Hey what brought the most diverse collections of games to the free market ever? Capitalism. More accurately fuck Activision.
---
Yeah, same here. Ythisens was who humanized the Classic team for me, who gave me hope that they wouldn't fuck it up.
---
Now he's gone, and the hope I had is gone with him.
---
I just hope he can do well wherever he ends up next.
---
We‚Äôll see. A fair opinion. Mine just differs. I think Classic will be a shock to blizzard execs and exceed their revenue expectations, prompting a surprise earnings beat for that quarter and likely a mention in the earnings call.
---
I think Classic is a sleeper that will do quite well for Blizz
---
I was 15. Stopped smoking pot and started using WoW. Didn‚Äôt have time to go smoke if I was jumping over the canal in Ironforge for a few hours. 
---
Such skill
---
My guess is that someone in ActiBlizz's management finally realised that the actual games they've been making haven't been doing as well as they could have, and decided it's time to refocus the company towards the fundamentals. A community manager isn't going to do you much good when people are upset that your games are bad and they're right.
---
Sure, except I can‚Äôt help but point out that yours is a feels-over-reals, pollyanna wishful-thinking opinion. 
---
I read investor analyses that paint a more realistic picture and form my opinions on industry projections based on those. They tend to be better predictors of outcome. 
---
And that thought process os why it doesnt work. I personally havent bought an EA game in probably 10 years. I dont support their practices, and if people stuck by their word as i have, EA either would have changed or gone under. But they all go "i am just 1 guy, i cant make a difference" and buy it anyways. Yeah, individually we dont accomplish shit, but together, we send a strong message. Especially with out wallets. 
---
Did anyone ever find a party with those?
---
17. I was going to class 7:00AM to 3:00PM and doing the PvP grind from 3:30PM to 2:00AM.. let‚Äôs say I didn‚Äôt do well in my classes 
---
Except they didn't "fuck up". Blizzard made record profits. The issue isn't the company, or even any specific shareholder or group of shareholders, it's the fact that every company is expected to be infinitely 'expanding'. 
---
I mean, you can cut non-essential employees, and do all the damage control you want... but at the end of the day the fact remains that Activision has and will continue to ruin the company. Until Blizzard detaches from Activision they will never return to their former godlike status.
---
Lol bliss is such a joke at this point
---
This is how companies act under capitalism lol. The issue with a system is never simply a moral failing on part of a single person or group of people.
---
Me honk that kind of orc.
---
I vaguely remember using one for deadmines when I first started (probably early BC) and I think it worked pretty well, but considering this is my only memory of them, maybe not.  
---
Yeah - I did it once after someone in Westfall kept spamming for people to join. 
---
I got grouped with 5 dps.
---
I have no idea what companies you follow, but every company talks about 3Q and 4Q plans, and even stuff into next year (although most companies don't want to provide guidance or anything concrete that far ahead).
---
What class was your main?
---
we're just not their target demo anymore
---
Sucks that a community manager that was so well thought of was let go. 
---
However, I think it‚Äôs worth noting that they are largely firing sales, general, and admin roles and actually announced that they are going to go on a Dev hiring spree with the intent to churn out content faster. They also alluded to the fact the have a number of Diablo projects in the works (not just immortal).  Not a horrible earnings call if you listened to it. I think they are aware they lost their way. 
---
I‚Äôve been in a company with massive layoffs and it sucked but the company came out much stronger at the end of it, and unfortunately cuts like this aren‚Äôt surgery - it‚Äôs butchery and you inevitably lose some of the good people with the bad. 
---
I‚Äôm hoping Blizzard can turn itself around!
---
we dont need to stop anything, both mean that you need a new job.
---
It was pretty terrible. That's why they axed it and turned it into a summoning stone. I just like to remind the "LFG ruined wow! No changes!" people that the only reason it wasn't a thing in vanilla was lack of ability, not lack of desire.
---
Yeah, IMO very different games but at the same time, so much in common.  
---
Please don't leave out "Activision" when you talk about Blizzard. The Blizzard we once knew is dead. Activision have fucked it beyond recognition. 
---
Ok so by you logic.
---
Your family member died.
---
You murdered your family member.
---
They mean the same thing. Your family member is still dead.

Extremely idiotic.

The large middle class that currently exists - the only large middle class to exist in the history of human civilization - arose as a result of capitalist economic growth.
---
That said, feudalism is appealing because when it was working the way it  was supposed to, it was probably characterized by strong social roles and responsibilities.
---
The coming rule of post-human technocrats (not capitalism) over a teeming mass of proles, with no middle class, will probably have a lot of negative characteristics for most people, but maybe the techno-demigods' awesome, eccentric projects will be interesting.
---
If I had my choice, maybe I'd choose to be a peasant in a feudal system in which the people above me had the appropriate sense of responsibility toward those below them in exchange for their service and loyalty. 
---
Mogasm: The Cumming
---
It doesn't actually work the way you are thinking; they aren't buying it back for purposes of regaining control. They are buying it back to effectively reduce the number of outstanding shares so that their distributions to shareholders are more concentrated. 
---
If I had one share before the buybacks that earned a dividend of $0.37 annually, these buybacks could mean that maybe next year I get $0.38 (assuming the same cash amount to distibute next year) since there are fewer shares to distribute the cash to. Now my share is more valuable because it means a potentially greater payout in the future. I can sell it for a higher price now.
---
That is a grossly oversimplified explanation of how buybacks work, but it captures the essence of how buybacks increase share price. 
---
That guy was far from being the only one fired, my man.
---
I have been a warrior since vanilla, but i have to say after playing hunter on private, i can now claim that it‚Äôs okay for hunter to roll on this 2h sword.
---
Reasons being 
---
1. By zg patch, warriors can farm and obtain unstoppable pighead from av easily.
---
2. Hunters cannot use 2h mace, wow what a surprise, since they can use staff, why not everything lol.
---
3. They need that big fat raptor strike crit.
---
4. It just looks better and cooler and BIGGER than two shitty looking stat stick.
---
5. It‚Äôs a hunter weapon.
---
honestly, some of the conveniences of retail are sooooooo attractive as you're grinding your way through vanilla.  If the progression wasn't so unsatisfying classic would be a great way to show people why all those modern improvements are good.
---
Wow and Adderall started around the same time, I remember the first day because it was the day of BWL release.

---
I personally love the achievement system in WoW, I just hate how the community uses it as a gatekeeper to grouping.  The idea of "link x to join" is frustrating, but having more content to go after is great imo.
---
Ah gotcha! Thanks for the info. 
---
They seem to be heading down the Craptivision route of quantity over quality
---
Has there been any new communication from Blizz since the demo? In particular any discussion of the feedback they received following Blizzcon?
---
I feel like you could just advertise in world chat and accomplish the dame thing without going to the instance. This is probabaly faster as well.
---
Eh, screwem, I like the interaction of selling things face to face (so to speak) rather than the AH.  Unless you were spamming, like, every 10 seconds lol.
---
What are you on about? When people disparage LFG they are talking about the Wrath+ system that automatically grouped you (later with people on other realms), summoned and un-summoned you to a dungeon and allowed you to 5 man without leaving a city or talking to anyone. Original meeting stones were barely ever liked or used, but the systems in TBC with summoning stones and and the LFG window are generally liked, but really have little to do with what people mean when they talk about LFG.  
---
  
---
All types of LFG that existed before Wrath were basically fancy chat channels, which will be implemented through mods or via Discord channels in Classic even if they're not in the game.
---
And they‚Äôd still be a billion dollar company....
---
I don‚Äôt really follow your logic.  You‚Äôre arguing that anything from after vanilla that wasn‚Äôt part of vanilla due to lack of ability should be fair game for classic?  That puts almost everything on the table, including many things that the community almost unanimously agrees should not be in classic, such as flying mounts, no debuff limit and dual spec.
---
8....started playing with on my dads acc when the game came out, and he later gave me my own a few weeks in.Still playing from time to time, 22 now.
---
The 17 year olds are into Fortnight not WoW
---
Modern WoW is essentially over at this point, hopefully classic will still be a thing but it has been radio silent for a good while now. 
---
Erm you're a bit late with the Brack outrage manufacturing. We went through all this months ago and the end result was that he was not an instigator of the Galaxies changes. I get you're trying to be upset, but Activision/Blizzard 2019 really has absolutely nothing to do with the situation Galaxies was in in 2005.
---
While solo pvp is my "main goal" I still want to perform well in the other areas of end-game content and from what I   have seen it would be rather challenging to get a spot in a premade BG group as a hunter or shadow priest.
---
Helpful reply regardless, thanks!
---
As a consumer, voting with my wallet is the only way I have to express my disagreement with a company‚Äôs actions. Demeaning that is idiotic. 
---
I remember exploiting mob tagging as late as wrath. It took a little extra effort but was crazy fast compared to someone just following you through the dungeon.
---
as a priest, you cant bubble people unless they are in your party
---
&gt; They seem to be heading down the Craptivision route of quantity over quality
---
That ship has long since sailed my dude
---
I actually liked achievements when they were first introduced in tbc but I feel like over time they‚Äôve become bloated, just like the fact there‚Äôs like a million different character titles in retail.
---
Great article, I agree on all the points.
---
New blood is much needed for a community to survive long term and you seem to be the kind of breed that will enjoy Classic.
---
I'm looking at my old Quake 2 community and see the same two active hubs left with no new names on the lists since god knows how long, and thinking of the inevitable when health declines for these geezers.
---
So yes you should play, and bring friends.
---
Brack isn't even the main punch with this post.
---
The point I am trying to make is the decisions overall mirror the situation with SOE.  
---
I was 10 started playing back in Christmas 05‚Äô, quit during mop and started in the private server scene and with nost.
---
If only dwarves had something like the human special melee attack animation. I love my dwarves but the spin move is just silly
---
oo another idea. Could it be talents such as Healing Way or Purification messing with it? Im not 100% sure how talents factor in - before or after the spell power?
---
It was actually the inn keepers, too.
---
The problem was, it would just throw you into a goup with whoever the fuck else clicked that "join this dungeon" button, including the level 40 warrior trying to tank Maraudon.
---
It was so useless it basically didn't exist.
---
I‚Äôm just curious if is any reference to the course of the game.
---
I just can't wrap my mind around that. I make $23k a year. He makes *$30 million*.
---
Is any job really worth that much? Is any person? What the hell....that's so depressing....
---
I made sure I didn't have any talents when testing but a good theory nonetheless
---
Honestly that scares me worse. Ea has a horrible reputation for doing mass hiring sprees to push content, and then mass layoffs after release cycles.  
---
Why would it? It specifically states it‚Äôs cutting non development jobs so it makes little sense that the development of classic would be affected. 
---
You mean, just playing the game for the sake of playing the game?
---
*What a monster*
---
Time to head back to Eve Online 
---
Very good summation.
---
So Activision won't fuck with it.
---
Honestly getting a raid spot might be out of the question altogether. As someone said itt already, it'll take you 8-10 months to get to 60 at this pace. There most likely will be the second wave of content released by then. 
---
You could join a guild a social player and join alt raids, but then, if you do that, your class choice doesn't matter that much. So I'd go with hunter as well. Faster to level, you might get to 60 in 7-8 months instead of 8-10, and if you're only doing alt raids no one really cares what you play. Plus, hunters aren't very gear dependant, which is another bonus. 
---
If you decide to play Horde, you could also pick shaman. Everyone loves shaman totems. 
---
it is not the same because that involves the third party - law or state authority. this is not the case.
---
you can be fired without any correction from the authorities.
---
Yeah, I figured that shamans wouldn't scale as well as the classes you mentioned in naxx gear, but that is still a couple of years in the future. By that time I will probably have leveled up another one or two characters. My question was more geared towards the period right after release. I guess I should've mentioned that!
---
It is a matter of preference, but I think I would go Warlock. The tier 2 armor looks badass, and demonology with pet sacrifice seems interesting.
---
It's silly, but that was always one of the coolest things about the faction difference in WoW, more than just lore/gameplay, the people were different on a collective scale.
---
A bunch of filthy, hunchbacked freaks vs a coalition of shiny soldiers of justice. Very different types of people are going to find one of those two options appealing, the faction identity was palpable. It made it that much more fun for my 14 year old edge-lord self to enjoy attacking some happy-go-lucky gnome player. 
---
And then blood elves were added. Yeah it made enough sense lore-wise, but come on. Keep the Horde ugly. 
---
Achievements came in Wrath, but yeah I agree.
---
I think they're fine. They've shifted over to shitty mobile games which will earn them so much money, especially from China. Their existing PC based customers are probably screwed though.
---

---
I can tell by the way you type/talk that you believe that you come off as sounding intelligent whe you couldn‚Äôt sound further from that.
---
Wrath pre patch to be exact so tbc
---
&gt; No, homogeneity is not just a boogyman. It has severely hurt retail. It has caused problems in several other games I've played as well (look at rift...they have one of the most varied class systems I've ever seen, but their macro system is so powerful you can make every class and spec play virtually identical....and then the game becomes boring as all hell). I will grant you that homogeneity gets blown WAY, WAY out of proportion on this sub and other places, but it is very much a detriment.
---
Making all the classes very homogenous is obviously bad, but people around here think that any tiny change which makes things in any way more homogenous is exactly the same as making everything perfectly homogenous. Which is like being too afraid to take one step out your front door for fear you will end up walking to Somalia.
---
&gt; Let's try that reworded then: "Nothing bad happens if all the tanks can perform a basic tank function. The tanking classes remain distinct in lots of other important ways."
---
So why aren't you crusading(hah!) for a pally taunt and for both pallies and druids to be able to push crushing blows off the hit table? Those are both basic tanking functions for Vanilla.
---
This is straightforward whataboutery. If you can't discuss an issue without dragging in every other issue it means you don't have a decent argument.
---
There are lots of ways vanilla could be improved. I'm not against any of them, as long as the cumulative impact is no greater than the impact of any other patch, like 1.9 to 1.10, or 1.10 to 1.11. Wholesale changes bad, small and judicious improvements good.
---
&gt; The argument about other offspecs isn't about gimping druids. It's about keeping druids the same as they always were and one of the reasons for that is not to make life harder on other offspecs.
---
It's a terrible reason. You can always make up a fairy story where any improvement for any one class, spec or race makes things worse for someone else, somehow. That isn't an argument against every possible improvement.
---
Add WC3 to that
---
I can tell by the way you type/talk that you believe that you come off as sounding intelligent when you couldn‚Äôt sound further from that.
---
Is it really stronger than stun resist, though? One free spell in 2 minutes versus several resisted stuns depending on the situation?
---
You missed the "intent" part of the equation. They intended for there to be a debuff limit (which they showed when they increased the number of slots from, I think, 8 to 16), they never intended flying mounts (as evidenced by unfinished parts of the world blocked off by invisible walls). Dual spec I'm honestly ambivalent about. I wouldn't mind it but I'm not gonna advocate for it. I like finding a unique mix for a general purpose build (can compete in all aspects but doesn't excel in any)
---
They won't keep a single public-facing employee. You think they're gonna employ enough GMs to review right click report appeals, etc?
---
Chill out man, loot trading is a way to cut costs that makes classic more financially reasonable. Sharding at launch is going to make the whole thing possible, again. Neither of these things is that bad. Honestly you seem to be forgetting about the big picture here. No lfg, no lfr, no instant 100s, no vanity pet book, no boa gear, no 100 different ridiculous mounts, no pointless hardmodes with reskinned gear, no teleporters in every city, no transmogrification, no demon hunters or death knights, 
---
The return of class identity, adversity, achievement and community. It's going to be OK.
---
As for laying this guy off? His job, like full time job was to talk about wow, and we know next to nothing about classic? I'm not seeing a lot of value added, so even if it were a real job, which it is not, I'm not really surprised that it got cut. 
---
Lol! As a gay male, playing a male blood elf was an instant draw, but I see your point.
---
Don‚Äôt gild me I dare you
---
Well put.  To expand on classes.  Every class didnt do the same dps or heal the same... only warriors tanked... and guess what?  IT WAS FINE.  Every class was 100 percent unique.  I just dont get the need to homogenize everything.  I distinctly remember being deep into naxx and seeing every class represented in the raid... 
---
So, I also do costing for remote agents.
---
They are a bit cheaper, but not much. You still have to cover the cost of their equipment, which is actually more expensive because it‚Äôs not centralized with efficient IT teams &amp; setup.
---
They still need supervisors/managers.
---
They still need benefits, and they still need sick days and vacation time and public holidays.
---
In fact, the office space itself is not a huge cost because call centers are located in places with low cost office space, they are not in prime downtown locations like a corporate office would be.
---
The main benefit of a remote agent is they can be easier to higher (in markets where staffing is constrained) and may have lower turnover. It‚Äôs not so much about the direct costs.
---
As for the players as GMs ideas... yeah, good luck with that one. I don‚Äôt even want to get into it, but suffice to say it would be an absolute clusterfuck trying to run a professional customer service operation with volunteer/barter player-GMs. It works for p servers because players don‚Äôt *pay* to play on p servers. The customer expectation is different.
---
Rammstein and a pack of newport 100s.
---
I'm of the opinion that no one deserves that much.
---
Profits need to scale with how many individuals you've engaged, not how much of a whale you can make each individual out to be. Otherwise these companies will always ruin games like this. 
---
Stop supporting this shit. You KNOW EA does this. Don't play Apex, OW, or CoD or you'll just empower them to restart the cycle. 
---
This prisoner is exuberical.  Put him back on his oar until he works it off.
---
¬øPor qu√© no los tres?
---
Capitalism is fine until we sit idle while corporations take over the law making process thus allowing them shit all over the little guys simply to further their own greed.
---
We haven‚Äôt gotten any major updates or a concrete release date yet. My guess is that will probably come a few months later into the year. 
---
I am biased in the fact that I really liked WoW Vanilla. It was hard and you had a lot to learn with rotation, boss mechanics, managing mana, knowing what talents to get, figuring out how to make gold, figuring out how to PvP, figuring out how to position yourself during combat, and learning how the other classes operate so you could work efficiently as a team.
---
For example, if you get aggro as a healer to learn to run to the tank instead of casting psychic scream and aggroing more mobs. Or knowing when to use a soulstone (use it right away to save the tank, or wait for a wipe to use it and rez the group?). Or learning to run away far from where you pulled so the Paladin can divine intervention you. Or knowing to click off Blessing of Protection if needed. As a druid, knowing when to use a battle rez. There is a lot, but if you are willing to learn WoW Classic can be a fun game.
---
[he made $65 million in 2013 when the blizzard merger worked out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kotick#cite_note-10)
---
I agree wholeheartedly
---
This is the most broken part of American capitalism. Not the idea of profits..the idea of infinitely expanding and increasing profit. All that matters is the next quarter's growth. 
---
yeah because attacking the person really helps with your case 
---
&gt; Extremely idiotic.
---
wink
---
I was there. it was like a fucking ethnic cleansing in a third world country. people you've played with before, your friends, your guildmates, just... gone, never to be heard from again. it's been said that SWG lost 90% of it's playerbase in a month, and it sure as shit felt like it.
---
what you have to understand, though: SWG had a [ridiculously complex class system](https://swg.fandom.com/wiki/Professions_\(pre-NGE\)), with near unlimited combinations. you wanted to be a guy who kicks in teeth while designing houses? why not. a smuggler, who often "overclocks" equipment, while growing fucking rancors? alrighty then.
---
...then NGE came and it turned all this into a dumbed-down WoW clone, and a bad one at that.
---
bottom line is, what SOE did was a fuckup of utterly ridiculous and damn near inconceivable proportions. Blizzard/Activision would have to work *really hard* to do something even nearing that.
---
It's true. But you also shouldnt just sit back complacent and accept it. Things never improve that way.
---
I've always found that converting dollars into seconds really helps these numbers sink in.
---
10,000 seconds = 2.78 hours
---
100,000 seconds = 1.16 days
---
1 million sec. = 11.57 days
---
1 billion sec. = 3.17 years
---
1 trillion sec. = 31,709 years
---
welcome to reality
---
it is depressing. there are no developers around today that were as good as blizzard from 1996-2004
---
Is Tips going to make a 10 minute video about this too? 
---
&gt;If you're still subscribed to retail for example, you are part of the problem.
---
Blaming people for playing a game they're still enjoying is pretty low. The vast majority of the playerbase doesn't care and probably doesn't know about half the shit the forums/Reddit complains about.
---
yeah but will you pay for the new expansions?
---
when i was 10, me and two other friends decided, we will be blizzard when we grow up (don't ask how we thought that possible lol). But at this point i am over it, I mourned blizz when i read the news they were bought by activision...
---
If only they could...,
---
Oh right, I can just go play all the incredible Venezuelan video games instead... 
---
Fuck Capitalism*
---
LeBron James makes more than that, and is severely underpaid because his job has a max contract size.
---
Apparently 80% of Kotick's salary is sick options btw.
---
"Dev hiring spree" which is really a focus to pump out more of the content they already have on the market. There is going to be little to no innovation within Blizzard in a few years, and their games will get stale, and die.   
---
What we saw today is the next step toward death for Blizzard.
---
You started smoking pot before the age of 15? Sounds rough man :(
---
Ah that makes more sense
---
I had 100g before level 20. I was an undead rogue with mining/enchanting. I would sell copper/tin, buy cheap green items and sell the dust. By the time I got to 40 I had no trouble buying my mount. Although it was probably 2 or 3 months of daily play.
---
Never looked at a guide. I was just doing what I thought was fun. I also twinked myself out with 2 BoE epic daggers at level 39 for a week or two.
---
I remember those.  I queued up for SM and was matched with 3 hunters, a warlock and a rogue.
---
No, being a former Blizzard employee is a huge plus on your resume.
---
confirmation for classic being a second tier in actiblizz eyes.
---
The merger was like 12 years ago lol.
---
Nostalgia 
---
Not sure how either would affect that, it looks like this queries through /who periodically. There's a notice that acknowledges the guild data sometimes messes up so it looks like it's just a fault in the query system specifically for retrieving guild info. Now about the fact that my guild's GM shows he was in this guild on his personal page, but is not on the ex-member roster, might just be a problem with this website's back-end.
---
isn't it funny how the 0-7 priest has more honor than the 50-12 rogue?
---
It's just the way of the elite. Especially company CEOs sacrificed everything to get to their position, combined with a pretty sociopathic personality. It's not like they just get this money for no work either, these people pretty much work 24/7 and they have a huge responsibility to their company, their employees, shareholders and customers. And of course their families irl as well. 
---
I make a little over 11k a year but I have an enormous amount of free time, no responsibilities and I wouldn't trade that for a 7 figure income.
---
They have 9,600 employees and the last real game they released was Overwatch.
---
Robots instead of GMs
---
????? Lmfao
---
I think his point was more that if you boycott Blizzard for bad business practices or shitty development etc then you should also boycott pretty much every company out there from Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, Walmart, anything produced in China or India, food from out of your country etc etc and the list goes on. 
---
Not that I agree/disagree with this, I just think this clarifies it.
---
Earnings on a product not even released yet? Lol...

---
Was really pumped for WC3 remastered but at this point I don‚Äôt even think I will be getting that. This company has become a joke.
---
In your fantasy world maybe
---
Look mom I posted it for the 20th time 
---
I just need to play through Classic and get my fill.  
---
Then Blizzard can die however it wants to.  
---
&gt; the *only reason* it wasn't a thing in vanilla was lack of ability
---
Looks like you missed the "intent" part of the equation, but it doesn't matter.  I get what you mean now.
---
not really. just a few "wait and see" posts on the forums from a blizz employee who has now been fired.
---
They aren‚Äôt entitled to a job.
---
If you know what's good for us all, you'll downvote this re-post into oblivion.

Why don‚Äôt you go add insult to injury and tell them ‚ÄúHey hey, you weren‚Äôt laid off...you were fired.‚Äù
---
How many games have you played that were made Uganda, Haiti, or Thailand? Super fun that you get to compare a single exploited third world country to the entirety of the first world, ahaha
---
Classic WoW was cancelled today. Back to private servers I guess.  
---
And you're not entitled to good video games, doesn't mean it's not horrific that 200 shy of a thousand people are out of a job despite helping make blizzard billions of dollars
---
&gt;Is it too late to just sever Blizzard from Activision at this point?
---
Is that not the point of buying your company back?
---
yeah at this point, I feel like a private server would be better
---
Depends on how much money they personally make for the entity paying them.
---
LeBron directly creates hundreds of millions of income for his boss (whichever team that is) because of the money that people willingly spend to see him and buy his merchandise. He also creates income by winning sports games, again increasing spending by fans in that ecosystem.
---
He's the one driving all that spending which outstrips his salary, why would he not be worth what he is paid?
---
It absolutely did hit the fan.
---
BFA has been a shit show, they killed HotS, Starcraft has been dead forever, nobody gives a shit about overwatch, they lost Bungie + Destiny.
---
As for new games there is nothing coming. All we saw at blizzcon was a remake and a phone game.
---
But sure, everything is fine because they made a bit more money.
---
This is incredibly impressive. Thank you so much. If I can ask your opinion, which ability is better to take in PVP as a 30/20 + 1 Elemental/Restoration... Elemental Mastery or Nature‚Äôs Swiftness? 
---
For now.
---
why not?
---
Back? I never left!
---
I sincerely hope Activision Blizzard doesn't ruin Classic and it's every bit as awesome as it deserves to be.
---
However if they do ruin it, at least we get data to make even more accurate pservers.
---
I wonder how long it took to compile a 3minute video with only Zerking pom pyro ap ephemeral power one shots.
---
That's what is known as envy. 
---
Not good 
---
I've leveled 3 of each to level 60. Whenever I'm playing a Lock I'm wishing I were a mage. Aside from some gimmicky things like healthstones etc, mage does everything better especially end-game relevant things.
---
I was a huntard. I mostly just did solo PvE with my Hunter. And the first few 5 man dungeons that I knew well. I didn't learn to dismiss pet until I wiped a few groups and everyone called me 'huntard' :(  I did learn better, but just didn't run dungeons anymore and never raided. I felt lonely without my pet.  I did raid some with my druid and actually saved the day a few times which feels so much better :)  
---
All I ever see is 12 retards fighting endlessly in the middle and the other 8 people actually playing the objective 
---
Paging u/TipsOutBaby
---
I played during retail Vanilla and literally never got use out of these things. They effectively didn't exist.
---
i think they know. i think they cry because that's the feeling of *fired*. i think the sugar coating isnt helping
---
You should have played a night elf like the rest of the gays.
---
Obviously they are.... 
---
Bungie did it 
---
My autocorrect wanted the honk and so it shall have it I guess
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
honk honk
---
Really? I would play a night elf but their torso looks kind of deformed. Also their faces look either bored or angry.
---
As I wait more and find more shit about blizzard and classic I have zero hopes. I think, I will have to go back to private servers. They will fuck up WOW classic.
---
These people aren‚Äôt entitled to a job at blizzard.
---
All I am saying is, it was not their fault.
---
Saying they were fired implies that they were at fault and brought this upon themselves which could not be further from the truth.
---
They were laid off and thankfully they can collect unemployment which is a small consolation.
---
In the end it sucks to lose a job that you really love.
---
Look on the brightside, you paid more taxes than him too.. oh wait...
---
Go live in a mud hut on your own then you filthy commie
---
Pretty much perfectly summed up everything I think about it.
---
The only things I would add to it would be the black of item identity and player identity.
---
Item identity is simple. Classic has iconic items that you want to get. They are items that will make you feel cool if you equip them. These days we just get ilvl 400 legs, ilvl 400 weapons, etc. Nothing that feels important or worth remembering.
---
Player identity is more of a subconscious thing for a lot of people. In Classic, you are an adventurer who eventually takes on the biggest challenges they can find. Most importantly, you are whoever you are.
---
In retail, you are not you. You are the Champion of the Horde/Alliance. You are the commander, hero, wielder of the most iconic weapons in the universe (in legion), hero of the world, and somehow the most important character in a world filled with other players who are also the most important character. This creates a less enjoyable feeling. You aren't an adventurer, you are god. Then there are the "main character" npcs who somehow still dwarf you and make you feel worthless in comparison. They build you up to be the most powerful and important character in the world, but they also treat you like a worthless nobody at the very same time. This creates an unsatisfying identity for the player.
---
...I smoke those still..
---
That‚Äôs true, but blizzard Merged with Activision, which is different then what by god did.
---
I had a series of bad class choices (rolled two classes I'd never played, but discovered I didn't like) and decided to throw in the towel.  
---
At that point I was already so far behind and didn't feel like leveling a third 60 of a safer choice.  
---
Shame too. I have an unbound Frostsaber on my warlock just wasting away.  
---
blizzard is dead its clearly activision-activision now.
---
Its such a shame
---
That is not what is happening here....
---
If they respect the massive influx of Classic players in their designs and refocus retail on what those players are looking for? I reserve the right to make my decision then
---
Not really given killing blows don‚Äôt mean anything
---
RIP Classic. Damn shame but unsurprising. Blizzard today is not the same company that made the original WoW, not even fucking close. Classic will fail from the terrible company in charge of it.
---
Stage 4 tends to be terminal.
---
I get that. But then people who don't realize this will claim that "class X is overpowered, look at this video" or will decide something along the lines "hey I want to roll a moonkin and one-shot everyone with Starfire too"
---
They are both slang terms for losing your job. "Laid off" tends to imply no fault, but saying it feels like precious HR-talk, so I don't like to say it. It feels as if I'm going along with BS code words for something bad.
---
It‚Äôs personalized via input. 
---
If you are fired from a job you may not be able to claim unemployment which is extremely helpful to some people while they are looking for a job.
---
I cannot understand how you think these are slang terms.
---
Just stack fury warriors
---
Again, they made record profits in 2018.  They are fine financially.  Shit has not hit the fan yet.  Even if it did, they would still be insanely profitable 
---
Aye my expectations are bare minimum at the moment.  Sharding/CRZ is what ruined retail for me and we are positive sharding will be in classic, anyone who says just the starting zones for the first few weeks is utterly delusional.  Retail servers are run on cloud servers that can't handle more than 20 people in an area... do you think they are gonna upgrade their servers for classic or just stick with what they got that is the cheapest option?
---
the time limit that was put on WSG was such a disaster of a thing to happen
---
some of the best moments I ever had in WoW was 1-2+ hour long WSG battles where either team had a chance to win
---
This just in: Blizzard Lays off 10% of Employees and Why That‚Äôs a Good Thing for Classic
---
Warriors don‚Äôt get feared, so you‚Äôve got deathcoil, and if you have two warriors gangbanging you, you‚Äôll be dead in 5 seconds. Just saying.
---
My guess is an alternative timeline based on vanilla wow principals.
---
Just finished watching.  Solid vid, lots of good info.  
---
The highlight for me was the analysis of weapon enhancements.  I've leveled multiple shamans to 60 and I always believed (with no data to back it up) that the best enhancement to use is generally the one that you most recently trained, which is to say that there isn't as much of a difference in dps between RB/FT/WF as people dogmatically claim.  Really funny to see that after all of that ridiculously in-depth (in a good way) testing that the data might be moving closer to my baseless theory.  
---
On that note I'm also glad to see someone taking p-values and variance into account.  It's nice to know that Spell A has greater average DPS than Spell B but we need to understand the variance of that DPS to know which spell is optimal for various situations (shorter vs longer fights).  Brings me back to my Research Analysis class.
---
Lol. Ohh shit. We‚Äôve got a badass over here. I love the argument from authority. You must be the only guy around here that reads investor reports right? Shit, if only us plebs knew about them. Absolutely no way anyone else on reddit has an idea what THOSE are. 
---
Fuck man, why didn‚Äôt you just start the conversation that way? Could‚Äôve bowed down to you from the start. Who gives a shit about my investing experience or knowledge or education. This guy reads the fucking investor reports!
---
The fact that you don‚Äôt even know how the argument from authority fallacy works is hilarious in the context of how cocky this weird attempt at a reply is. 
---
It's ignoring a lot of history though. WoW has survived bad expansions before. 
---
it's also survived layoffs before, Blizzard ALONE laid off 600 people in 2012: https://kotaku.com/blizzard-axes-600-employees-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-5889338
---
Female dwarves are extremely rare if you want to stand out. Of course male and female gnomes have pink hair if you're into that.
---
Im not gonna support Activision-Classic, fuck this shit. Will never leave private servers.
---
Except (unless he has changed which is possible) J. Allen Brack was working for SOE and Star Wars Galaxies and was very against the NGE
---
What happened to SWG was horrible but i dont see any similarities coming anywhere near that in WoW.
---
[nope.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Blackout&amp;oldid=302004)
---
&gt;the bubble is finally fully bursting with nothing left to salvage it,
---
I don't think you could be more overly dramatic. 
---
I think 2019 was just a bad year for them. I think people are just on edge because there's nothing new and the current wow expansion isn't being received well.
---
*DEEPSIGH*
---
still ironic given the fact that the scoreboard placed top the guy with most killing blows and the guy posted here actually saying that he got 50 KB just like in a fps death match where KB indeed mean something.
---
Cunnilingus Master.
---
Not a chance lol.
---
Lmfao at how accurate it is that the only way you‚Äôll ever enjoy vanilla wow again is through a private server because blizzard doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about what classic becomes then yea, lmfao.
---
For the commenter above: When people say buybacks, they're talking about Activision buying Activision stock that is out on the market. Upon Activision buying a huge chunk of its own stock off the market, the total supply of the stock that's out on the market will be less, thus because there's fewer shares floating around they are made more valuable.
---
Thus then the investors' portfolios are doing better because the stock in Activision they own is now worth more.
---
Blizzard, as a part of Activision, doesn't interact with stock or anything of the sort. They'd have to seek some kind of legal settlement to end or nullify their merger they entered into like 10-12 years ago.
---
WoW came out post LotR trilogy, and Alliance was a far more popular faction than Horde back in those days
---
Not to mention they didnt have hunched back looking monsters.
---
Its pretty obvious that Alliance was played by far more casual and younger players, who wanted to be Legolas. Its a meme today, but back then Legolas was the "cool character" from LotR, sort of like Han from Star Wars.
---
Many Horde zones were unpleasant (Desolace), their races were ugly (Trolls) and questing often felt incomplete. Blizzard has stated many times that they mostly finished Alliance predominant zones and cities first.
---
Thus if you sat through all the BS as Horde, you were really *devoted* to the Horde, and you felt a inferiority complex. You wanted to win first and foremost, and if that meant you played Druid, then your obvious mission in a WSG is to carry the damn flag. Nobody gives a shit about your lackluster cat dps as you are trying to rake up kills. No. Get that flag you goddamn furry. 
---
That mentality is what made the OG Horde so great, there was a certain level of angst and sheer rage at wanting to tear the Alliance, limb from limb.
---
This is ridiculous paranoid nonsense. Even on recent WotLK private servers that I've played on with loot trading I have never *once* had an incident with collusion screwing anyone out of an item.
---
And that's an environment with no Blizz oversight aka no punishment for being a dick and no long term reputation risk.
---
Just play the game. It's much better as a player to be able to solve problems yourself rather than having to ask a GM to intervene.
---
It's all about cutting costs. Good customer service costs money. It's no longer about the community/game. The accountants are in control now.
---
It's just the reptilian brained suits at work. This is a bucket of ice water to me for whatever WoW Classic could be. 
---
Free DLC with a $15 per month subscription ü§î
---
&gt;Again, they made record profits in 2018.

Source please. Kotick did not say profits.

No one on my server used those, to my knowledge.
---
At least pservers will always be a thing so there is LIGHT at the end of the tunnel. We will always have HOPE.
---
nah you're trying so much more. maybe some ad hominem, maybe telling me what to do, lying about editing a post(no idea why you did that?!) maybe redundant nuances, fishing for karma, trying to be a dick while posing.
---
you know what you've done :)
---
&gt; These execs don't want to make money, they want to make exuberant amounts of it.
---
It's quite literally the job ("exuberant" aside)when you're an officer of a public corporation
---
Capital cities being so close to UBRS/BRD/MC/BWL is pretty sweet.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? 
---
You have some crazy ego problems. 
---
You were WRONG.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about and have never lived through this. Otherwise you would know there is a difference between being fired and being laid off.
---
bad quarter? they had the best quarter in history, up to 50% better than last year's in different metrics
---
Easier access to the Mountain - so that's good.
---
And Paladins are the best, so that's pretty good.
---
It'll be a good time, friend. I hope you like the look of Ironforge. 
---
expect /2 arguing about if DM is deadmines or dire maul, what does VC mean,  and why nobody calls deadmines; cookies cavern
---
also the stockades dungeon, which if youre horde you've probably never done before.
---
Care telling me what is there to salvage it then?  
---
  They've just announced a major layoff in their q4 report, around 800 employees were fired, blizzard side is in flames and allen brack had to basically write an apology letter.  
---
  Every single one of their IPs is on hard decline, their only future prospects is redoing old games. 
---
  They also have no projects lined up, and what would possibly save them before which is activision is also on the decline.  
---
  Their stocks keep going lower and they've never seen in this negative spotlight before, not to this degree.  
---
  Unless classic is an absolutely massive success, there's nothing that would put them out of this problem coming out in the foreseeable future.  
---
  And if they do, the damage is done, blizz is now fully considered one of those bad companies in peoples eyes.  
---
  It's not only that they're on a bad spot, it's that they burned bridges to get to that spot and to top it off, there's absolutely nothing in the horizon that could get them out of it.  
---
  And I don't know about you but I wouldn't call 800 fucking people losing their jobs in a split second due to bad management decisions, people that were among the most beloved by the community and many that made blizz seem understandable, people that wanted to retire at this company, is overly dramatic.  
---
Some really epic quests(Jailbreak is amazing, nothing like it on the horde side), friendlier people, about the same level of assholes (most roll gnome),  more idiots, more kids, inability fight as a group in PvP (get ready to lose a lot in unorganized BGs), better PvE classes with pallies and Dwarf priests which can lead to faster progression.
---
That guy's ridiculous but actually has a point in this limited case. Back when Blizzard was the best game companies had to care what their consumer care and think about them. Audience was small and they couldn't just buy ads on Facebook and inject 10m new homesitting moms into the game to keep the core community backlash from affecting any business metric. Now that's Blizz moves into mobile field audience becoming even wider, advertisement cheaper and community less active.
---
I associate vanilla wow with RA too. Certain songs bring me back to specific moments in wow, it‚Äôs crazy.
---
well if classic doesnt work out they will be handing a perfect copy pasta to our private server friends. Win win for me
---
&gt;around 800 employees were fire
---
That was ATVI as a whole. They've laid people off before https://kotaku.com/blizzard-axes-600-employees-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-5889338
---
&gt;Every single one of their IPs is on hard decline, their only future prospects is redoing old games. 
---
A game's performance is not the same thing as an IP in decline. 
---
&gt;their only future prospects is redoing old games.
---
Thats near future prospects. I don't think they have anything for 2019, and they've admittedly said that. But that doesnt mean their next generation games don't have a prospect.
---
&gt;Unless classic is an absolutely massive success, there's nothing that would put them out of this problem coming out in the foreseeable future.
---
Thats true. But thats mostly because we don't know what projects they have in development. 
---
&gt; It's not only that they're on a bad spot, it's that they burned bridges to get to that spot and to top it off, there's absolutely nothing in the horizon that could get them out of it.
---
I don't think thats necessarily a problem. The problem is when no one is interested in the bridges you are trying to sell them.
---
&gt;And I don't know about you but I wouldn't call 800 fucking people losing their jobs in a split second 
---
Once again, that's ATVI as a whole, not Blizzard. And those weren't developers making games.
---
&gt;overly dramatic.
---
I don't find that overdramatic. I found your evaluation of the IPs overdramatic. Blizzard made over 600m in Q4. That's a far cry from worthless IPs.
---
What if we started a petition to bring him back? Think they would respond if it got enough signatures?
---
This adds nothing to the convo but I want you to know that your comment made me laugh out loud for some reason, I guess the way you formulated it
---
That is all
---
I can‚Äôt be the only person who has had their classic hype absolutely gutted by Blizz. My expectations are gone. Companies that are this profit hungry don‚Äôt make ‚Äúpassion projects‚Äù
---
Now think when you buy your WoW Classic copy how much of it would go to the higher ups wallets.
---
Thats fucked. I had no idea it ended up like that.
---
Yup. Saw the writing on the wall the day they nerfed cataclysm heroics. It was the last time Blizzard made normal content actually hard for the average player instead of quarantining it off to people who are dedicated to seeking it out. 
---
True but he was the best link we had to blizzard. I don‚Äôt know if there are other CMs but he is the only one I‚Äôve seen post in a long time. He did a great job. Ysithiens being laid off feels personal.
---
Neat UI I must say (for that time :D)

41% operating margin (all time record)
---
I think Blizzard understands that they HAVE TO make classic as faithful as possible to please oldschool fans, it's a really simple concept and I think we've made it very clear for them, so I'm not to worried about that
---
I‚Äôve noticed completely different mentalities on horde and ally. Not just in wsg.
---
Shamans level well. They aren't the fastest levelers but they are extremely steady and stable with 1h/shield w/ flametongue.
---
Every single guild wants as many resto shammies in their raid comp. You are rolling the class that is the most wanted by every guild, from the top 0.1% to the casuals. Shammies are that good to have.
---
So either Activision believes Classic is not a ‚Äúmajor‚Äù game. Or perhaps it‚Äôs the ‚Äúnew‚Äù comment in the article and they don‚Äôt consider Classic as a ‚Äúnew‚Äù game.
---
Everyone will buff you in passing. You don‚Äôt even have to ask.
---
Boasting about record profits, then sacking 800 employees. 
---
Seriously. Fuck these companies.
---
I'm just going to take a few things from, the Ster Dust, thank god for him. 
---
I mean, this is all that blizzard could come up with for the large range of problems effecting the company? The fact that there ridiculous growth over the last 10 years from 10billion$ to 60billion$ company worth, any fucking high school educated student could have told you it wasnt sustainable. 
---
And once again, they take aim at the Expendables, the average Joe worker, the team member who put years of his/her life, blood sweat and tears into your company, your company which just BOASTED that you made RECORD PROFITS.
---
Do we take a more thought out approach, such as perhaps lowering the pay of executives similar to what Nintendo did during the 3DS "downturn"?
---
Perhaps we dont give our new CFO a 15$million  sign-on bonus? Or maybe Bobby takes a small cut, or does $28,698,375 seem like a fair yearly wage when he just sacked 800 employees?  
---
Or do we look at the state of our current library, the fact that we have no major titles announced.
---
What about our community of not only loyal fans? But PAYING customers, nope fuck them as well. 
---
No, we sack 800 worker, it's easier. And we keep our astronimically ridiculous pay packets. 
---
What I really hated was the tone of this all, boasting about your mountain of money, a mountain that you'll never reach the bottom of. And as if sacking workers to boost your profits by reducing KEY SERVICES your community loves is fine because they are just cannon fodder foot soldiers in our game of chess.
---
Fucking Activision Blizzzarddd.
---
I miss that game so much. I remember my first character was combat medic and then doctor and I literally sat in town for hours just buffing people for tips and listening to their adventures. It was a masterpiece that no game has come close to replicating 
---
If you meant by that that you wanted to work for them, I did too. It was my childhood dream. At least the creative community is still alive making machinima and what not... mostly.
---
&lt;edgy worship of capitalism
---
TIL not being retarded is "edgy".
---
and playing stupid :)
---
"I love it when the boss takes all my money! I love not being able to afford the doctor! I love capitalism!" 
---
How do boots taste?
---
It doesn't have its own $15 per month subscription. It's included in the regular WoW subscription.
---
Worker-owned companies. 
---
Good luck living in your own world.
---
I can see you NEED to get the last word in so you feel like you ‚Äúwon‚Äù even though you realize you were blantantly wrong.
---
I will be the bigger man and allow you to have the last word like the child you are.
---
Ultimately its completely different than Bungie, because Blizzard's founders sold out when the company was worthless in 1994. Bungie's leadership had money. Not to mention, that Bungie had to give up all their IP when they left Microsoft.
---
I guess we can justify that and just tell ourselves it's free then? 
---
thx for the wishes but i dont need them.
---
how is pointing that you are the bigger man makes you the bigger man?
---
there it is plain and simple. you need to be praised.
---
:)
---
Thats not really true. I regularly run into the same people here on WrA. The same, guilds, et. RP Realms are the last of the old realms. Even then they still have sharding/CRZ but, not to such a degree.
---
Yeah - they said as much in the call and pressers. 
---
This year is 2 remakes and a mobile game - with some additional content dropping for Overwatch/HS.
---
Basically Classic WoW, Diablo Immortal &amp; War3:Reforged.
---
None of these are considered 'major' releases. 
---
Wait until the income blows them away. We will see if it‚Äôs ‚Äúmajor‚Äù or not.
---
An Azeroth with *one* measly moon? Literally unplayable.
---
That article really hit home on a lot of the main things with retail right now and while i wont say i dislike retail and the way it is currently, i prefer the way classic was for the exact reasons in the article the main thing being that you could do so mucb to personalize and separate your character from everybody else in vanilla where as now everybody is the same for the most part.
---
In vanilla i would raid weekly with my guild that was very good and i was the 4th druid in line for healing gear and since it was rare for the druid set to drop at all it always took months for me to get my tier sets and i was fine with that because when id actually get an item it was incredibly rewarding and i hung on to that feeling with each item forever pretty much. Currently in retail even when i get something good im happy for a few minutes and then already plotting how to replace it with something better because its that linear and easy to improve gear. In vanilla when i got a raid item drop i knew i was gonna be using that for months, especially if it was a tier set piece. 
---
Like the article said about being able to create a unique identity for your character, i spent so much time in vanilla on my main and alt farming the rare enchanting and alchemy recipes which turned into my character being one of the few people on the server to have them. Players would specifically seek me out because i had those recipes and i built relationships off that. The few players that had the same recipes as me would talk to me and we would set the prices for the server and also help each other with the AH by letting each other sell our stuff and things like that. 
---
In current retail i have every profession across my 4 chars and selling gems, flasks, enchants, and whatever is all about repeatedly undercutting and relisting your items when you get undercut just to sell things and everybody has access to all the same recipes with the only possible differences being what rank and material cost you have for making an item. Im not complaining about the way retail is right now and i do still make A LOT of gold but there is no special feeling that goes with professions anymore and aside from a few quests/WQs theres nothing you can do to really set yourself apart with professions and its the same way with grinding that rare mount or a lot of those achievement type decisions you could make back in vanilla. 
---
The article is spot on about gear and the way the game
---
is because i stopped playing at the end of legion and just came back to BFA exactly one week ago. I payed for BFA and my subscription with gold i had from legion and in that one week i got my priest and paladin to 120 and to 378 and 369 ilvl, while lvling my shaman and druid to 115. I was able to hit 120 on my characters,  run a few regular dungeons, then heroic dungeons, then the warfronts, assaults, the new LFR, and finished doing the weekly quest to complete 4 mythic dungeons which gave me some gear drops and then a 400 ilvl reward. So just off doing that stuff on both characters i was in full epic gear and capable of running the normal mode raid or lower level mythic plus in just a few days of playing. While i like the fact that i can gear up characters so quickly, the article is absolutely right that it devalues the game and is a big reason of why i need to play 4 characters and play the AH constantly in addition to farming things to make gold from in order for me to feel like i am having the full experience of the current game. If i just played a single character i would be bored silly very quickly. 
---
Compare that to vanilla and you could never run out of things to do on your main character and i cant think of anyone that had more than two characters at max lvl in vanilla. I think i finally made an alt that i slowly leveled after our guild was farming BWL and didnt get that alt to 60 until we were farming AQ40. Once i had two characters i still had to dedicate most of my play time to my main and it was such a bonus to have an alt that i could gear easily with t2 plus gear.  When BC was announced i was about to enter college and i ended up selling my wow account for 850$ very quickly because of what my account had on it, that should help to validate how much effort and accomplishment there was on that account.
---
So personally i cant wait for classic wow to come back out and instead of a druid as my main i think ill be playing and undead priest this time. My main concern is that now as an adult i am not sure if i will be able to invest that same effort and time into making my character as good as i was back in the day, but i am sure going to try. Many people are saying that classic is not going to be popular because once everybody loses all the new quality of life stuff that retail has they will stop playing classic but for me losing that stuff is what makes you and your character special which makes the game great.
---
I hope so too!
---
From our perspective, Classic is **'major'**. We've been waiting for over a decade for this.
---
From the perspective of Activision's CEO and CFO - it's basically "DLC for WoW with no cashshop". So certainly not 'major' to them.
---
Started playing at 11 back when vanilla first came out. My dad and I would play together all the time. I miss those days.
---
Nobody's going to read that. You're on /r/classicwow, not /r/wow and here you'll be downvoted for defending anything retail. 
---
Didn‚Äôt the druid tank staff have a chance to drop there? Or one of the epic boe staves? I could be thinking of something else but I thought it did.
---
Public company.  Owned by the people who profit off statements and not content.  RIP.

Refer to my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9kuizb/the_results_are_in_here_are_the_databased/) as to why that video is bad.
---
Mages are only superior because it takes their best parse which is obviously the one where they got ignite on Loatheb for 4k dps which massively skews the overall dps.
---
If even blizzard believed classic wow would be a great success they'd share more info and try to generate hype.
---
That's what taught in business classes in college.
---
MBA's are for networking, simple as that.

My ivy league MBA taught me jack squat, but it did introduce me to the brilliant man who i ended up convincing to be my business partner.

This right here

‚ÄúThis conclusion only acknowledges value that users experience directly. Naxx added substantial depth to the world for everybody, including people who didn't see it.‚Äù
---
I didn‚Äôt start until BC, and I was young when I did. I didn‚Äôt really begin to understand the game until almost the release of WotLK. Naxx was always some almost out of legend. Watching old fight videos, reading lore, drops, etc. having something incredibly hard to do makes the game so much REAL. It gives you something to work towards. I did the AQ quest chain and completed Treasure of the Timeless One during the end of Wrath with a couple of friends. It was one of the most epic and immersive things I have ever done in a video game, following in the footsteps of some of the most elite groups of players is mesmerizing. I understand it isn‚Äôt the best business model, but holy hell, when I think of my time playing in BC it was such an exciting game, with so much to learn. 
---
Blizz did not the company as a whole. 
---
If you want to join a tryhard guild its likely you will not have a place as your strengths are all replaced.
---
Nightfall is better suited for a warrior because its more reliable and the fury will still do more damage.
---
Your melee buffs is easily achievable by a resto shaman. The melee group will always have a resto shaman go deeper into the enhance tree for the totem buffs. 
---
Overall their DPS is sub-par. Their utility is non-existent in a setting min-maxing, and the one thing they are remembered for in Nightfall is better suited by warriors - and hunters even. 
---
Disregard everything I said if you are joining a casual or even average guild. They will take one because they probably won't ask their warriors to nightfall or resto shaman to go for totem spec. 
---
And it's not Blizz who gets lay offs, the company as a whole
---
Putting on my tinfoil hat it is a possibility that they are downplaying it a bit so when it hits it big it looks that much better on paper and they can say they exceeded their expectations.
---
That might explain some of this no news too, people are acting like the world's falling and that they "aren't hyped anymore" but the fact they lurk here everyday or on the battlenet forums screaming for more news says otherwise.
---
Just remember, the Night Elves dancing on mailboxes are dudes.
---
Enjoy.
---
Best MMO, sure.
---
&gt;Pffft, I'm the best CoD player there is, I'm way better than the all these Counter Strike players at their own game.
---
That mentality.
---
Classic is included in the BFA sub.  That's how they worded it..
---
and didn't a bunch of countries just hard ban loot boxes, fucking over EA?
---
I'm also enraged that we live in such a society.
---
Within a few years? There is already little to no innovation. 
---
The thing I most like about Alliance is that the zones/cities are a lot more relaxing for me. So when I'm doing everyone's favorite activity, which is AFKing in the main city, it's just an aesthetically pleasing AFK compared to Org in my opinion.  
---
For visuals, I play Horde for things to look "cool" and I play Alliance for things to look "nice"  
---
Well I'm 30 now, not 16, and I don't really have that "I want to look super cool" attitude. Instead I just want things to be relaxing/pleasant.  
---
But to be honest the only reason I'm Alliance is because gnomes are the master race.  
---
This is true. Yeah it's pretty bad. I'm kind of over wanting to play any more of their games. After so many years of buying blizz games. 
---
Nice, that was really helpful
---
"Gamers making games for gamers" - Blizzard, 1999
---
"Lawyers making money for executives" - Blizzard, 2019
---
Isn't it technically against the law for them not to?
---
As executives of a publicly traded company they are legally obliged to do whatever makes their shareholders the most money. 
---
While true, that's only a record for the Activision side (aka Blackout sold them a ton of CoD boxes and probably saved a bunch of costs with the Bungie separation). Neither the report nor that presentation mention any records for Blizzard or the entire company overall.
---
Most of the people let go seem to be on the Blizzard side (esports, publishing, and PR), which did not have record profits.
---
I did find it amusing that in their listing of total company assets they claim $9.7 billion in "goodwill."
---
One moon. The second moon will be unlockable via a serverwide micro transaction farming event, √† la Ahn‚ÄôQiraj except with dollars.
---
If you roll need on something and don't equip it straight away you get right click reported as a loot ninja and auto banned. 
---
They'll also be policing vanilla servers more diligently than ever before, unfortunately. 
---
Ohhgee has a lot of educational pvp videos. Mostly for Mage but also other classes. Check out his Mage pvp movie, he explains most of the tricks he does.
---
Perplexity, best vanilla rogue by far. He also likes to narrate his pvp videos. 
---
Monkeynews, he likes to make long compilation videos. I think his videos are very educational for Warrior pvp. 
---
Dushichka warlock pvp, also narrates most of his tricks. 
---
I figured it was something along those lines.  That also means the company isn't planning to dramatically increase it's product line in the next two years.  Otherwise they would want as many shares out the door as possible right?
---
50% of the males on alliance are gay, but they know how suck your dick from the back. This may be a turn off to going alliance for straight guys, but just remember that means there are basically 50% more female availability. 
---
why do you call a lie? whats lied about the difference between laid off and fired?
---
I don't believe so. That staff dropped as a random world drop, with a think slightly higher chances on elite mobs. But I don't think it dropped off any mobs over level 50.
---
I sort of like achievements for obvious stuff like killing raid bosses, doing quests &amp; events, exploring zones. That sort of thing. It's kind of nice getting a small reward when for example exploring the entire map. And it's nice being able to look back at everything you have accomplished on your character. 
---
But bloating the achievement system with tiny irrelevant stuff kind of ruins it for me. Like I don't give a fuck if I ate this food while having this pet while in this zone. 
---
I don't really understand the hate for achievements at all. Especially not the "link curve" issue a lot of people seem to be having. 
---
1 billion seconds is 31.7 years. 
---
Who ghostcrawlr?
---
The guy was the primary antagonist of sending DMCA notices for private server streams. He also stalked one streamer in their Discord and got them banned on Discord for harassment. The guy is a stalker.
---
I mean technically LeBron, but through sponsorships.
---
&gt; The idea of "link x to join" is frustrating
---
The idea of people creating pugs for people who have the raid on farm, and don't want to carry a bunch of people through their progress every week? 
---
Like I get why people feel frustrated by not getting a spot in a group. But why do you think you have some sort of right to get accepted into every group? If they don't accept you then they can clearly find other people who can show more experience. 
---
Only thing removing curve/achievement would do is make it more frustrating for pug leaders filtering out the players they want. 
---
If you're good at pvp games, go Warlock. If you're new to mmos or lack confidence against other players, go Mage.
---
Pretty sure Blizzard has a reputation for this as well 
---
I think I may not have done a good job explaining.
---
I don't mean to say that somebody deserves to be carried.  What I do mean is that it should be about relationships formed in game that get you invites in a social game. 
---
Because vanilla players were really really bad. If you watch old raids and pvp videos the players appear to be legitimately braindead with the way they‚Äôre moving and clicking their skills. The average retail player today is far better than vanilla player from 2004. This is a big reason why I fear that Classic raids will be too easy for everyone and Blizzard should consider retuning the bosses. Private servers like to overtune the heck out of the bosses and disable all world buffs and still the raids are easy so imagine what kind of shitshow Classic raiding will be if they keep it like vanilla. 
---
ignore this op, as people have said below 90% of the quests will be easy to follow and just require reading the text, and 10% are sort of vague and may need to be looked up or asked about but after that you're golden. i'm not at all used to older games and still had a blast with classic so i think you'll fit right in, give it a shot!
---
I think the community has control over this. Seeing as it's been a pserver thing for a while.
---
You can opt out of this qol thing as well as all the other data mined things in classic though, if you like.
---
Let's give the industry something to talk about at launch.  If we hit record subs, and the game receives the praise it deserves we may yet see a blizzard with clear direction for the future.
---
They don't seem out of sync to me. Almost all communication from them has mirrored the feelings of the community pretty much to the letter. 
---
I'll give a rundown of classes that I know of.
---
DPS warrior. Great time investment, much competition. Avoid if casual.
---
Warlock. Low time investment, low competition/shortage of locks, but requires some raid preparation in soul shard farming before each raid and summoning people to raid. Bloodvine set requires a bit of investment.
---
Hunter. Low time investment, low completion but there is also less of a need for them in raids than warlocks. Gear is also fairly easy to acquire as you will probably be 1 of 2 maybe 3 hunters. Probably the easiest class to make money on with maybe only warlock/mage rivaling them.
---
Rogue. High investment, high population. Their gear is not nearly as expensive as warriors but you will be killing yourself trying to gear up as both warriors and rogues and even sometimes hunters/cats will try to obtain the same gear as you. Rogue and warrior DPS are some of the most played classes so its a bottleneck.
---
Mage is similar to warlock, it is about a low to moderate time investment. People always enjoy bringing mages to dungeons/raids. They can AOE farm easily for that MULA$. The only time they require investment is their bloodvine set really.
---
Druid is a bit of a different story. Depending on the spec, as I've played all of them I'll try to give a detail into each spec. But one thing they all have in common is their gear competition is next to none, tier wise. Only having 1-2 druids per raid is easy loot. 
---
Resto, low priority from most guilds. Usually a paladin or priest will take loot over you if it is worth it. They are however probably the easiest of the healers to make money with because of their ability to just throw on DPS gear and DPS or simply have a hybrid spec that can be mediocre in healing and dps. Also they are the most mana efficient healer so less spent on potions. 
---
DPS cat druid is pretty bad, and it will be even worse if the gnomeregan weapon doesn't work on classic. But it sounds like it is not up your alley because it requires you to farm gnomeregan for your BIS weapon hundreds of times (because it has 3 charges only, each charge lasts 30s). 
---
Tank druid requires a ton of preparation, it was my favorite spec to play in vanilla and on pservers. At the beginning its easy and both hard to get your gear because you are squishy as a fresh green 60 dungeons hurt but get easier and as a tank you can choose what to farm. To be a respected tank druid you need to get your BIS gear. Which is exalted WSG, Arathi and relying on RNG loot sometimes (LBRS Ormok gloves or ST trolls for shoulders early on) and you also need to have a decent offspec. Whether that be having a good DPS set or a good healing set is up to you and your guild but you need one for when you are useless on fights (and you will be useless sometimes). Not being able to DPS or heal in a pinch will often be the deciding point in being able to raid or not. So this one is probably also off your list as it is probably one of the more grindly specs.

---
&gt;What I do mean is that it should be about relationships formed in game that get you invites in a social game.
---
Well. You're not going to get many pug raids going by individually talking and getting to know players. At some point you got to announce to a mass audience. And at that point you need some sort of system to pick out which players have the experience you want and who doesn't. Before achievements I think people mostly looked at peoples gear, if you had gear from Ragnaros for example then obviously you had done Molten Core. 
---
Probably not. I checked out at werewolves and goblins. Then it just seemed to get worse and worse every time I looked up what the new expansion had in order.
---
Honestly, I hope classic wow is successful if only for the potential for it to move on to BC or WoTLK 
---
That's not really a faction specific thing.
---
&gt;Most of the people let go seem to be on the Blizzard side (esports, publishing, and PR), which did not have record profits.
---
Eh, I think its more accurate to say they are letting people go that arent providing direct revenue. 
---
I still agree with OP's assessment, they're (Blizz)  overall fine financially. They brought in 686 million dollars in revenue. 
---
"BFA has been a shit show, they killed HotS, Starcraft has been dead forever, nobody gives a shit about overwatch, they lost Bungie + Destiny." is not really a good take from today's earning call. 
---
Assuming there‚Äôs no dots on you.
---
&gt; Boasting about record profits, then sacking 800 employees.
---
They didn't have record profits. They had record revenue, and profit is on a drastic downward spiral. 
---
Do not be outraged about things without a basic understanding of them. It's dangerous. 
---
5 heals for 20-men, though you can 3/4-heal it if you outgear it or know what you're doing with cheese strats.
---
~12 healers for 40-man raids. Bring 14+ if you're doing Sapphiron where the healing is intensive. 
---
Horde wants as many shammies as possible, alliance wants a few pallies to cover every blessing.
---
Travel is *far* less convenient as Alliance than it is Horde. As Horde, you can go back and forth between Kalimdor and EK with zeppelins that are conveniently placed right outside Undercity and Orgrimmar. No such thing on alliance. You need to go to Menethil Harbor if you want to go between continents. Plus you need to travel way more for leveling and the Alliance questing zones from 1-30 are more spread out. 
---
On Horde, you can get from 10-30 on a single continent, and all the zones are right next to each other at that. Stonetalon, Ashenvale, the Barrens, and Thousand Needles are very convenient to travel to and from. On Alliance you need to juggle zones that are way further apart.
---
Not that any of this is bad per se, but it does add on to travel time.
---
Executus
---
Is this the best way to make money as a rogue?
---
Because the boss mechanics are more complex (its not *just* stay out of the fire, its stay out of the fire while managing adds and staying X distance from the boss) and (possibly. Haven't done any group content since early cata) require faster reaction times (I distinctly remember the "blink and wipe " cast times in heroic cata 5 mans). Also rotations were simpler. No joke, I *literally* fell asleep while tanking one of sulferon's adds (spam heroic strike, sunder, shield block and revenge. 1,3,5,6 on my bar). 
---
Yeah but do you really think we're gonna get any customer support after this? It'll all be automated systems and a skeleton crew of GMs with millions of tickets in their backlog. 
---
I was afraid of that :(
---
oof theres a name i havent heard in a long time
---
I'm praying for BC then Wrath with Character transfers all the way up. And Cataclysm too but I'll stop before Dragon Soul.
---
Dividends come directly out of equity so every dollar they squeeze out of a fired employee they can split with what we call 'stockholder's equity'.
---
Why would they release garbage like Cataclysm again?  
---
W H A T    H A P P E N D    T O    T H E    M O O N  ?  ?
---
The main difference is you can expect to be corpse camped a lot more, as Horde tend to be more ruthless in PvP. In fact, I may be the one camping you. Lok‚Äôtar ogar!
---
Indeed, thanks. Pesky decimal points.
---
what's he up to nowadays?
---
Yup, me and my guild did it for twink reasons, the xp gained made it almost pointless unless you just auto followed and went to do something else
---
You bought and played BfA. You're shitting on Blizzard but you're still going to support their future endeavors by playing Classic. You've actually placed your own money into J. Allen Brack's pocket. Hilarious shit, if you truly believed all the crap you just typed, you'd refrain from purchasing another Blizzard product ever again.  Just admit it, you're going to eternally bitch about everything Blizzard and still buy all their games because you're too pathetic to move on.
---
12. I'm 24 now. Switched back and forth over the years between Runescape and WoW. I quit RS around 2010 and I quit WoW right after MoP came out. Came back to RS for OSRS, WoW for Nostalrius and you can bet your ass I'm gonna get classic. 
---
Fuck em games gonna be great

Because it wasn't garbage. The dungeons were more challenging than classics. Like I love classic and I can't wait for it, but the dungeons are more in the ways of epic adventure and cool locations then challenging. I can't speak for raids as I didn't raid in cata but I know the end game dungeons are vastly superior in Cata, and honestly they are just cooler.

Your using linkins boomerang to ranged pull in an undead based dungeon?? Dude.  Exorcism...

I could see that.

Druids can tank fine up until endgame, and then they fall off pretty hard.

It's a very gray area there. Your second part is true but it's more so they cant take willingly known actions that will cause them to lose money. You could spin the idea of keeping your support center open as having a value to the company and not be in violation of the law, but at the same time as you wouldn't be aggressively trying to make as much as possible you might lose or not gain investors. But again... isnt it fucked up that thats a thing in the first place?
---
Yes, some persons are worth that much.
---
So I've read quite a bit of the transcript, amongst a few articles such as Kotaku etc. 
---
There is actually no mention of the world profit or revenue I could really find (so I'll take one of the chin for that). Regardless, I still dont even know what you meant by your comment.
---
Its common knowledge that revenue is amount of income without expenses, and profit is calcuted with expenses in mind etc. (Basically) 
---
NEVER-THE-LESS, it doesnt matter.. 
---
Why doesnt it matter? Well, because they simply broke all records there company has ever made(in terms of making piles of fucking cash), even when profit is calculated to include the expenses, blizzard will still have broken not only revenue records, but profit as well. 
---
Just to shaw up my comment, have a read below.

Take a quote from Bobby himself, try not to gag though, the corporate speak is almost sickening.

---
Fucking *sigh* 
---
 News flash you used to get a whole game for your money not a copy paste game with a shop there will be a shop in classic there is no way they will not try and milk us tbh I will still play peeps are right to vent they are worried cos blizzard     Has changed big time

Welcome to the worst part of Capitalism*

You are wrong.

Last I heard a few years back he went to riot but idk after that

Kind of, druids tanks are pretty strong in MC they get overshadowed by warriors in BWL (does not mean theyre bad just warriors outperform them) and than AQ druids get most if not all of their BIS gear.  They are more than capable of tanking naxx, and on some fights like patchwerk they are better than warriors
---
I really hate all the bleeding hearts that pipe up whenever a company cuts costs. All this winging about people losing their jobs due to "corporate greed" and such. 
---
Even saying something like "corporate greed" is redundant. The purpose of a corporation is to make money. Period. Thats it guys, its not to give handouts.
---
That being said, I hope it doesnt make any serious negative impact on customer support and server stability, we will see if its a mistake or not, but you cant go flying off the handle on this issue unless you already think their customer support is in bad shape.
---
&gt;Now I KNOW that beating LFR is hardly beating the game, but when everyone has already seen the last boss of the game, people feel less inclined to do the rest on a higher difficulty.
---
This is what a lot of retail players don't seem to understand and just resort to the kneejerk reaction of "Well, have you cleared all the raids on Mythic?". One of the main reasons why I raided in Vanilla and TBC was because I wanted to see those massive epic raid instances. There was no other way than to actually commit to a raiding guild. It made every time I stepped into that instance an experience. Hell, there were times where I would step into a half cleared raid instance only to do some exploring by myself.

There isn't much the CMs can really do to stop the rising tide of shit that the community can bring at times, but they can try to decrease its scale.
---
In that regard, Ythisens did really well. He helped humanize Blizzard (specifically the WoW Teams) and often participated with the community, talking about the game with them and addressing their concerns. None of the other CMs really did that, they failed at their role of "community manager."

Eligibility for unemployment isn't based on the terms "fired" and "laid off." It's based (in part) on whether or not the government thinks you lost your job because you did something wrong.

---
Jeff Kaplan, Blizzcon 2005 Dungeon &amp; Raids Panel
---
I really love that quote.
---
Another thing that ties in a bit to that, that I think is a major result of poor quality content is no. 7. Play the patch, not the game. Ever since WotLK this has been the case. Patch launch, play a few weeks, see everything, quit. These ENORMOUS surges in activity that they have during patches were just not present in vanilla, a little bit, yes, but it was barely noticeable. All the catch up mechanics they designed to "see" all the content, rather than experience it is what truly ruined PvE raids. They eliminated raid progression in WotLK, I personally cleared Naxx, TotC and ICC, but never got to experience Uldum, because I "missed" it, since i was far too overgeared for it with my badge grind gear. This missing content just never happened in vanilla, they had a good system for progression then.
---
Probably. Despite how much I dislike BfA, I think I got my money's worth. It wasn't good enough to keep me subscribed but I spent enough hours to justify the purchase of the new expansion + 1 month sub. I did come back in 8.1, but again, I wasn't interested enough to continue my subscription. I didn't fall for that bait pirate mount promotion though, nice try ActiBlizz.
---
Right. However being laid off guarantees you unemployment.
---
You can still get unemployment if you were fired but the company has the ability to fight that in some situations.

It's like blizzard doesn't know what made them special.

Why do black people like Newport cigarettes so much?

Im sorry what? Vivendi is still a huge French Congolmarte that tried to make a Hostile Take over of Ubisoft last year.
---
Vivendi was actually the larger company but needed the capital since they were in the red. They had been siphoning money off of Blizzard for some time to pay there debts. Though at this point i would prefer they were still with Vivendi. To that end they sold Blizzard into a Merger with Activision making a Joint Holding company where Vivendi eventfully sold off all the shares off.
---
Awesome feedback! I'm so glad you enjoyed the approach!
---
The dungeons weren't hard in Cata.   
---
Pretty much this. Locks and spriests scale better in pvp with stamina than other classes and that's what PvP is loaded with.
---
oh god pre-nerf shattered halls (and pre-nerf shade of aran in kara) gave me nightmares 
---
This is not a complicated concept.
---
Here are the facts:
---
Cash gets you a subscription.
---
Retail gold gets you subscription.
---
‚Äî‚Äî-
---
There is a demand for classic gold and subscriptions.
---
Now,
---
Player 1 wants classic gold and has cash
---
Player 2 wants a subscription and has classic gold.
---
Both players intrinsically have access to both retail and classic, as well as a plethora of blizzard social platforms to make the exchange easier.
---
Player 1 purchases a token and trades/exchanges/gifts the token to player 2.
---
Player 2 gives player 1 classic gold (and otherwise gives back the retail gold from the previous exchange as it holds the same value but is not in the currency he requires).
---
Each time this is done it injects that purchased gold into the economy. This leads to inflation where people who do not pay to win are at a disadvantage, ruining the economy and the gaming experience.
---
See retail wow for reference.
---
Pre-nerf Arcatraz was fucking insane.  
---
Rip
---
Bfa is included in the Classic sub, that's how I word it and probably many more in this sub.
---
If that was the case, wouldnt they have fired developers instead of support staff?
---
They laid them off because they didnt directly create the product they were selling, therefore they saw them as expendable. 
---
despite these issues Mythic+ is fun and keeps me interested
---
Still, holy priest with the 2nd most HKs.
---
The heroics certainly were. 
---
Their are not directly developing the product, but they are the link between the community and who is developing the product. A link that, Blizzard stated itself, is very weak at the moment. And after this mass lay-off it basically disappeared.
---
I love the old Orgrimmar. I can just hop between AH &amp; bank and feel like i get my moneys worth of entertainment. 
---
That was just an argument against what they did, not what I said.
---
Keep on trying to defend it. Still a super shitty thing to do.
---
The last ‚Äûreal‚Äú games since Overwatch they released were Spyro (over 10 Million copies sold), Call of Duty Black Ops 4 which not only sold a lot of copies but made tons of money through microtransactions. Furthermore candy crush is the second most profitable mobile game in the west just after clash of clans. You get my point... 
---
Just because you didn‚Äôt play any of these doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äòt real games. 
---
This lay-off was not something blizzard higher ups decided. It was a decision by CFOs, CEOs, COOs of a public company that have a strategy in mind for 2019 and beyond and have to keep the shareholders happy (which they currently aren‚Äòt). 
---
This whole situation sucks. It really does. But it won‚Äôt get better in the next couple of years with the rising Eastern market, focus on mobile gaming and content cycles. 
---
Indeed. It's the same kind of people that pulls the legs of spiders.
---
Ambush lol
---
Watch yourself, they really don't like it around here if you say the TBC pre-patch was vanilla. :-)
---
Those are Activision games, not Blizzard.
---
No. They said it in the investors call: they make cuts for a long term strategy and will aggressively hire hundreds of new employees. 
---
They won‚Äôt invest in CMs though as they will probably shift most of their customer service to automated mechanics, labors in eastern countries and higher game developers to not only safe money but produce more content to get more money. 
---
As important as CMs are for communication, a team of 800 developers working on microtransactions and Warcraft mobile bring in more Money than them.  
---
If those people, the people who are pouring blood, sweat and tears into their job aren't entitled to it, why is Bobby Kotick entitled to THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS a year.
---
Oh wait, that's right. In the grand scheme of things his job is pointless and he rakes in the most money out of everyone.
---
I normally don't wish ill on people, but God do I hope people like Bobby Kotick get seriously burned. People who lay off hundreds of employees and then give themselves a raise. People who take away the livelyhood of literally 200+ people all the while raking in millions of dollars a year. God I wish them nothing but the worst. Greedy, tax evading piles of walking filth.
---
Achievements are not good or bad. 
---
Pointless achievements like "looked at a rock five times" or "got Exalted with Bloodsail" (zing!) are bad because they are the lowest possible form of gameplay - perform a totally pointless repetitive action over and over again for a totally pointless display of pixels.
---
Achievements that teach you to use your skills or push you to master them are good though - "Mind Control an enemy player off a cliff" or "use Charge to climb a cliff" can teach new players things about what their toon is capable of without forcing them to do anything they don't want to do.
---
And an achievement for, say, killing Ragnaros seems like a good thing given that you could be a core member of a raid that killed Ragnaros every week for a month and still not personally get any Rag loot to prove you did it.
---
Only 12?
---
This is pretty damn accurate 
---
A handout? They‚Äôre successful so they‚Äôre going to negatively affect our games and franchises we love as customers? Their CS has been so much worse over years and is sure to get worse now. Some of the people cut worked for years to get there, only to be replaced for the investors and top that actually could get replaced for half the pay since they have next to no good impact on our games. 
---
Wasn't fire, he was laid off. Basically they saw their job as expendable so they axed it.
---
Not always about performance, it's about highers up trying to "CUT COSTS" by axing as many people as possible, so they can save a few bucks.
---
I myself, am voting with my wallet. Not buying Blizzard products, not playing their games, same with Activation. They are no longer the same company whose games I grew up playing. I am going to go where my heart takes me. FAR THE FUCK AWAY FROM THESE BAFOONS. 
---
Activision and Blizzard are the same company. Hence his whole point.
---
Iean, EA said that microtransactions in Battlefront 2 were a necessity, then turned around and told shareholders that turning off those necessary microtransactions wouldn't affect their profit... So I wouldn't trust publishers as far as you can throw them.
---
Disagree. Cata was a clear nose dive for wow both in design and my overall enjoyment. It was the first real gap in my subscription history.
---
Thanks I‚Äôm new so ill keep that in mind lol
---
Succeeding as a tank druid in Classic is going to be fucking rough.  
---
I have no arguments to make about viability. Because those arguments don't matter.  
---
The only thing that matters is the community's perception of tanking druids. That perception is not very good. It's bad enough that succeeding as a tanking druid is going to take some monumental work of game skill, but it's also going to take some social skill.  
---
It's the hard truth that will get downvoted to oblivion, but should be said.  
---
Is there any information about why he was fired?
---
Which model? 
---
You can make 50g in like an hour on a mage easily
---
When I say Vivendi, I mean Vivendi games, the subsection of Vivendi that merged with Activision to become Activision Blizzard. Vivendi games hasn't existed since 2008 :)
---
You're definitely not wrong. Everyone wants to be the one to later say 'i told you so'. Though I think some of that does fall on blizzard's legendary lack of communication which causes everyone's imagination to run wild. It doesn't feel good when they let go their best cm, who just days ago this sub was dissecting every sentence he wrote for some clue as to what's going on. Hopefully everyone takes a breath and we get some solid info. Until then maybe everyone should just go outside for a while and relax.
---
Is there any 'out' for Blizz? Fuck Activision.

---
The existence of a cash shop doesn't bother me. The precedent was set in vanilla when they released paid server transfers. Furthermore, a ton of p-servers have cash shops as well. Now, I dont want gear or instant 60 in the shop but I'd be more than happy to pay $5/$10 for full rested.
---
Not having a restoration druid steal the eye of sulferas from me. I say that but I'm not sure I'll even be able to raid this time around.
---
As a heal-sniping chart topping priest healer, I've always had lots of respect for the drood healers. Now innervate me.
---
They're both equally evil at this point, a separation would simply leave us with two shitty companies instead of one.
---
They made record profit, but apparently that wasn't enough.
---
Do hunters fall off in dps in pvp the same they do in naxx for dps during tier 3? 
---
It falls under the umbrella of just World of Warcraft since it's free if you sub to BfA. I don't think it's common to talk about projects that are in development in these calls, it's more of a recap of what went down during the year and what business related decisions will be made soon after the call.
---
At the next earnings call Classic will most definitely be mentioned, assuming it gets released when they say it will.
---
I just leveld my first alliance toon up to 40 (a lot of rested exp tho) and I found it to be pretty smooth.
---
Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Loch Modan, Redrigde, Wetlands, Duskwood, Hillsbrad &amp; Arathi are all pretty wel located and easy to travel to and from. (Sentinal Hill to Darkshire flight pad is even faster than running from Raven Hill to Darkshire I think)
---
Only the running to Desolace was a pretty long trip, especially cause I picked up Stonetalon flightpath on the way.
---
Negatives were Redridge/Wetlands ganking and acces to Scarlet Monastary.
---
I heard Darkshore is pretty nice to level as well, tho it does take some effort if you want to do the legendary Deadmines.
---
It doesn't really matter how we word it, if Blizzard says you have to subscribe to BfA in order to access Classic that's what we'll have to adjust to.
---
I'd rather just sub to Classic since I don't plan on playing BfA but in the end I guess it doesn't matter. 15$ is 15$.
---
Private servers will end up being a better option for vanilla fans
---
I played two characters primarily in WoW. from Vanilla to Cata. A Human Paladin, and an undead Rogue. I feel like only playing one faction is only playing half of the game. It's nice to not only see zones from the other factions perspective, but to also freely explore areas you otherwise couldn't relax in (raiding Capital cities ect.) So yeah i think you will have a blast. Its going to be familiar and different at the same time. Also one good thing to note is quests are way better on the alliance side, and thats not a biased statement. They designed the Alliance quests first and didn't design the Horde quests until late in development so they were more rushed. Enjoy!

They just fired him, yet Lore the hypocrite that blocked and called out the community is still hired.
---
I wish you luck Caden.
---
Fuck yourselfs Blizzard.
---
Another shitty move by our beloved developer.
---
Yes it works. Druid tank is better early on than endgame but it‚Äôs still fine. Most guilds won‚Äôt have the luxury of being picky with tanks. 
---
800 people were laid off from blizzard today due to ‚Äúrestructuring‚Äù. 
---
That‚Äôs a supervillain move.  Holding a moon ransom for money.
---
Yes, they were pre-nerf. It was great.
---
Whole buildings. With walls and stuff. Cities with only one entrance.  Having to dodge all those horde camps in the middle of the road. Awful flight paths.
---
The social aspect is everything to me - so i'm excited to hopefully find a nice social guild to play with.
---
I wish.
---
This is an incredily well crafted article pointing out the exact problems we all have come to know. It all started to go south in late wotlk after totc and with the release of ICC but the big shift came with cata.
---
Unlikely. Unless he‚Äôs somehow using loopholes to not pay tax.
---
Being "laid off" - that term - has no specific legal meaning, so no it doesn't. Being "fired" also doesn't mean you can't get unemployment.
---
I have lost my job because of a dispute with my boss, call that whatever you want but it's not typically what is meant by "laid off" - and I received unemployment. If you've been working for a while, and you lose your job without doing something bad, you can often get unemployment. You don't have to fit into a certain narrow reason for your job loss in order to get it.
---
By the way, I think it varies somewhat by state, in terms of exactly how it works - the requirements and the amount.
---
I agree. But who is gonna give us our little dose of information packed in beautiful written english now? 
---
You can't either say that they have the best of the company in mind because they earn more when the company flourishes. They seek short term success which is almost alsays bad for the long term(micro transaction). So when the ship sinks they scurry away like rats. 
---
Didn‚Äòt we say #nochanges? If that second moon aint up in the fking sky whenever I look up to the stars I won‚Äòt sub. 
---
Not sure if they're considering Classic as a major release though..
---
I first started when i was 8 in january 2006 during the bengals steelers wildcard game.  Been playing ever since but have taken 5+ month breaks every expansion since cata.
---
You think that this is all activision, blizzard started changing before activision bought them. And it was the REASON they did the merger/buyout. 
---
bfa still earned them a lot of money thanks to the release.
---
People unsubbing will be a long term effect on their figures. Furthermore they didn't talk individually about the game, so their earning calls gather every game they own.
---
I think you're right that I should have said "colloquial" - or maybe I should simply have said that those terms are just a manner of speaking. 
---
Yes you're right. Rogue in 19 &amp; 29 brackets are especially very good. But remember that BG are not supposed to be 1v1 fights.  
---
So you should take into account that a rogue won't begin every fight invisible. This makes a huge difference for them. For me they are the best in 1v1 (if they do the advantage of starting the fight with an ambush).  
---
Do troll's Beserking racial messes with spell coefficients or it works as same as talent that reduces healing/lightning spell casting speed.
---
You are absolutely correct, however when someone is LAID OFF they have done nothing wrong, no question about it.
---
When someone is FIRED there is an immediate negative connotation that leads people to believe you did something wrong that led to you being fired.
---
a.k.a. "fck you guys"
---
Do you understand WHY they are making more money than before. Because of microtransactions, consoles and mobile. Blizzard was the LEAST money making part of the firm. Lowest operating margin. Candy crush is CRUSHING blizzard in pure profits.
---
Blizzard part was mentioned as "overwatch is doing ok, wow subs are down, BUT WE ARE MAKING MOBILE GAMES NOW".
---
You could take the GOOD information too, like:
---
*  Investing more for our biggest, internally-owned franchises 
---
*  20% increase in development resources 
---
&gt; honestly, some of the conveniences of retail are sooooooo attractive as you're grinding your way through vanilla
---
Care to elaborate? The reason I'm asking is that I recently started vanilla and I can't say I'm missing anything from retail.
---
There's legal parlance and then common parlance. 
---
The term "Arrested" has a specific legal meaning, but is also treated as a common term for any form of police detention.
---
So you are right that there is a specific terminology and when media and reputation becomes involved the correct terminology is vitally important, yet theres no stopping the common parlance. 
---
In Britian, we'd say we got "sacked" in general conversation whether that was redundancy or dismissal, but on your cv and in any interviews you'd damn well make it clear. 
---
i wasnt at blizzard forums for years. i didnt knew there is a classic forum yet oO guess i have to check it out
---
What mean is that the words "laid off" are are words that are chosen as a way of signaling no wrongdoing. One can choose other words, such as "I lost my job" or "I was fired" and it doesn't necessarily mean he did something wrong. Sometimes people say "fired" to mean simply that they were forced out of a job against their will. 
---
Imagine categorizing record profits + not laying off 800 people as "handouts". 
---
Wow...
---
Ideally there'd be no employees and it'll be only him making billions of dollars.
---
I didn't play Cataclysm but I think the Wrath loot system is abysmal and usually just hurts the player.
---
I quit playing Wrath just a few months ago (probably will never play that expansion again, just as overrated as I remembered) and most of the time no one really abused the dungeon loot system but it was terrible for you as a player.
---
First of all in Wrath the loot is locked based on your armor type, so if you're a healing Paladin and a cloth healing item drops that would have good stats for your class, you're not allowed to press need on it because you can only roll on plate.
---
Same with DPS Warriors for example. If you're a fresh 70 and a really good leather or mail item drops that would help you gear up to get into heroics you can't roll need on it, you can  only roll greed.
---
You might think that it's not really a big issue, just roll greed on it and if everyone else greeds you just ask the winner to trade the item to you.
---
The problem is that if you have an enchanter in your group (which happens pretty often) there's a third option in the roll window apart from need &amp; greed, you get a symbol to disenchant the item which has the same value as a standard greed roll.
---
If you press the disenchant symbol and you win the item, it gets disenchanted and you get the material from the item placed in your inventory.
---
Whenever an enchanter is in a dungeon group, it's pretty much standard to roll disenchant on anything people don't need because the enchanting materials are worth more than rolling greed and vendoring the item.
---
So this means that if an item drops which would be an upgrade for you but you can't roll on it because it's not your primary armor type, most of the time you're rolling greed against 4 people who roll to disenchant the item and then you have to hope you somehow win the greed roll and get the item, which obviously almost never happens.
---
On the rare occasion that you don't have an enchanter in your group, you can try to whisper the winner to trade the item to you because it's an upgrade but from at least my own experience most people will just ignore your whisper and rather vendor the item for gold, I can probably count with 1 hand the amount of times someone actually traded me an item in a dungeon.
---
At least in vanilla you're able to roll need on literally every item and it's not some streamlined armor type garbage.
---
Obviously this doesn't apply to raiding, in Wrath the master looter can give any item to anyone regardless of armor type but it's just super annoying for a fresh 70 who's gearing up in normal / heroic 5 man dungeons. You have to pass up a lot of gear upgrades for no reason.
---
It also doesn't help that in Wrath in order to queue for heroics you have to meet a certain item level or you can't choose the option from the dungeon finder which makes it suck more when you have to pass an upgrade that is much higher item level.
---
Anyway, after playing the expansion again after initially quitting at the end of it during retail it just confirmed for me how overrated Wrath is, I don't get the hype a lot of people have for it. For me it's all about vanilla and TBC.
---
Generally in earnings calls they don't go into details, but they talk more about IP's as a whole. So you generally won't hear "warcraft Classic is coming out then and then" but you will hear "Warcraft has 2 projects being released in 2019, one in summer 2019 and one later on in the year" 
---
I respect that and since I plan to be in a guild with mostly people I know, the social work is done but if I can't rise to the challenge I'm not to stubborn to change.
---
I still love the written guides as well, but some folks like to see the actual footage as well so they have a better visual reference. That's why I am trying to include both text and video in these guides as well as Closed Captions in multiple languages. Trying to reach that broader audience.
---
At the same time I dont want their attention. Our very last classic update said its not being messed with because its seen as a rather small costing passion project with a high ROI.
---
If it BLOWS THE FUCK UP and overtakes live in popularity... I can guarantee they will be talking about it during their quarterly calls. At this point I don't want that kind of attention. lol
---
Its not, they announced that classic is a server option. Major releases get retail presence. Classic has no box to sell, its just a sub.
---
I remember zoning into BWL on release to check it out before the raid, and using the UBRS "collect Dragon eggs" item on Razergore's eggs.
---
We still wiped to Razergore lol
---
Not earnings, but it would be a part of the guidance for the year, but not in detail, generally you mention IP's there. 
---
The shareholders did let Activision and Blizzard merge... Which led to this.
---
Good thing imo, the less attention Classic gets from Activision, the better.
---
Plus, you know, wow isn‚Äôt their only game
---
Aq40 as that's where I stopped in vanilla.
---
Most likely for the same reason Vanilla players think they're better than retail players : ego.
---
Honestly dude let them fuck it up if they are that stupid! Private servers will always exist and at the very least we‚Äôll still have something closer to Vanilla then the garbage they‚Äôve put out in years.
---
I was 16 in 2005. 30 now.
---
Hi guys
---
Is it possible to do simple Macros without addons? Basic stuff like:
---
    change to Bear regardless of form but also don't shift out if the hotkey is accidentally double tapped.
---
    cast normal spells if not in animal form, else exit animal form and cast it.
---
    start autoattacking as soon as any other ability is selected.
---
    any other useful macros you can recommend.
---
Thanks.
---
**BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA**
---
Going on an actual adventure, not through of objectives I have to tick. Hopefully with my friends, making new ones. And mayyybe discover how raiding was back then.
---
Druid healer or lock for someone who has absolute MAX 12h/week?
---
Sadly this is where the world's at...
---
As soon as investors get a big voice in development stuff it's doomed to become a failure - NO MATTER WHAT THE PRODUCT IS. It happens in every single fucking industry. It appears companies need to learn to not to grow too fast - which is what I believe happens too often. Because why would they need investors if they can just grow naturally? I'm just praying that similar shit won't happen to GGG and their PoE...
---
‚ÄúWe still want to mai tint great craftsmanship‚Äù ‚Äúhigh standards, big games‚Äù
---
So much talk, so little evidence. The only right thing to do was to at least save the Diablo series &amp; sell the rights to a good indie Studio. 
---
All they do is talk. They put out nothing but trash for the last ~6 years. I know it‚Äôs not Blizzard, it‚Äôs Activision, but at the end of the day they decided to merge, so I guess it‚Äôs Blizzard too. I highly doubt there will ever be a Studio like Blizzard again but I hope this was an example for upcoming indie studios to never sell their rights to work free &amp; creatively in a market that builds on exactly this. 
---
When you hear it on the radio in a German Doctor's waiting room, you know shit has gotten real.
---
Lol that‚Äôs exactly what I meant 
---
Also worth mentioning: Tanaris, Un'Goro, Feralas, Felwood, Winterspring. Horde can AFK-fly to and from them, Alliance has to take the boat and then also fly a good bit of distance.
---
Dire Maul is the most important max-level dungeon and is on the same continent as the Horde's capital, but on a different one than the Alliance's. This means you're left with less time for the actual dungeon, and there's an additional risk for your party breaking up because someone went AFK or similar things.
---
The Scarlet Monastery is the biggest, most important dungeon in the 30-40 range. It's also right in Horde territory, easily reachable from Undercity and Orgrimmar, whereas for Alliance it's an eternity of running through hostile territory, especially if you don't have the flight points in Southshore and the Western Plaguelands (which a normal level 30 wouldn't have)
---
While the Horde's cities are reasonably placed on both continents, Darnassus is the worst positioned capital in possibly all of MMORPG history. It may as well not exist, and most travel planning will assume it doesn't.
---
Hey, to everyone their own - I won't critique you personally for this decision ;)
---
I said that I can't help but wonder. And that I don't see it happening. To me this is just like playing a random game on easy difficulty with that 50USD Microtransaction Weapon so everything becomes a one-shot. I never saw any appeal in this. And min-maxing wow-classic is just the same level. Classic is easy a.f. already. Min-maxing to those extremes is kind of just invalidating any content that exists. 
---
But once again, that's my opinion and as long as you enjoy that stuff, go ahead, enjoy it ;)
---
Yeah it's financially irresponsible for them not to follow the money
---
He's gonna get his job back. Watch
---
Basically everything has been made simpler/more convenient.
---
Quests are more streamlined, you got LFG, zones are scaled to your level, traveltime is way less, it's faster to level etc..
---
All of this makes for a much smoother leveling experience but it also removes all the fun from it, literally just feels like a chore to me that has to be done to start playing the game "for real".
---
Because it creates an incentive for people to pay for carries and others for selling it, an incentive which invalidates genuine effort. 
---
For example: if I told you that you need a diploma to get a certain job, but you can only get that diploma by either:
---
* going to college and studying for a few years
---
* paying someone to give you a diploma 
---
Wouldn't you feel that the diploma requirement is bullshit? It's not wrong to hire people based on education but when you can easily pay a reasonable amount to get it, it no longer becomes a matter of skill/perseverance/experience etc.. And don't give me the bs about people looking up to see if you have multiple kills, most just don't and maybe that person got a legit kill last week for real. 
---
Your entire argument goes to shit the moment you realize that getting multiple kills on a boss is absolutely no indicator for skill, performance, ability, etc. It's a system that caters to people who can either:
---
* stick with a guild until they can clear it the regular way (which defeats the purpose of joining a PUG while the guild is still clearing that boss)
---
* sneak their way into tryhard PUGs to get a kill (because they have the skill/knowledge/ability etc. but there's no other way around tryhards who'll judge them based on the achievement) 
---
* pay a carry raid to get a kill (because you failed to achieve the former)
---
* progress with a normal PUG group and get a legitimate kill (which is what you're against) 
---
It's a retarded system and any PUG leader who bases compositions on it isn't worth the title and shouldn't be leading. 
---
Look at gear, talents, ask if they know their gimmick / special assignments during some of the encounters and then see if they perform - otherwise fuck off and let someone else lead. We can train monkeys to make a raid composition and invite based on achievements. 
---
People on private servers are very different than the general player base of retail WoW. TRUST ME. 
---
You'll still have achievements. You're just not going to be able to link them in chat. You'll have to actually, like, talk to people about them and stuff.
---
He will never recover
---
Making 23k in US would be like very little in taxes with the current tax rates. $30 million on the other hand would be paying a shit ton in taxes. 
---
For me two moons being mentioned in quest lines definitely means that both should be visible in the game world. I see that as a bug fix.
---
To be honest if the druid tank is good and we have a good healer I'd do almost any content with one, happily, if he itemised well.
---
It‚Äôs not that they shouldn‚Äôt be paying that guy $30 million, but I‚Äôm pretty sure if they‚Äôre paying him that much they shouldn‚Äôt be firing the community manager who is good at the job and probably doesn‚Äôt make over $100k
---
Prettt sad if you think about CEO's like this.
---

---
Why do people downvote this? They are indeed, otherwise they wouldnt pay them that particular salary.
---
People may think its crazy and it is, but these big companies or clubs dont give them these kind of salaries if it wasnt worth it.
---
Yes I agree. I think they're more likely to engage in scummy behavior like double rolling on loot. They're on free, pirated servers with low long term expectations.
---
Don't forget that on classic there won't be any cross-realm instances or lfg. Reputation will matter especially on high-profile servers (it will even be streamable unlike private servers).
---
Okay, but I still don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs the problem in just giving us the Vanilla System just without GM support regarding loot. 
---
In all my years of playing WoW, not once, not A SINGLE TIME, anybody rolled on the wrong item, presses the wrong button or had any problems on loot given to them. EXCEPT ninja looters, which loot sharing actively encourages.

Add activision into the mix and you got a perfect storm.
---
"Bring the player not the class" is what they started with in wotlk when hybrids where whining so much about not doing as much DPS as pure specs in TBC.
---
What's the profession they need the trinket from? Alchemy? Enchanting?
---
Dont confuse revenue and profit with quality and viability of product. Blizzard are in for some hard times, and they got activision to thank for it.
---
I think his reddit username is kind of telling.
---
starcraft is actually in an amazing spot, we are getting 25k+ viewers on Ro32 group stages of tournaments. It's in his best state currently.
---
You can expect to miss the horde.
---
That happened to me on a p-server
---
110% the best thing about classic is the fact that we can datamine all the values from the server and host a private server that doesn't fuck up the game.
---
This assumes Blizzard doesn't listen to the very glaring community.
---
Enchanting. Smoking Heart of the Mountain. Of course, once you craft it, you can always drop Enchanting and go with anything you want. 
---
Jesus christ you people are some nervous soccer moms. They don't mention a niche game that shares a subscription with the normal game to a room full of people(shareholders) that doesn't care about anything but money and there's 10 posts on the forums "Bad sign?!?".
---
This isn't going to end well for Blizzard...
---
Nah he wrote it absolutely perfectly. It's just your denial because you're still thinking Blizzard is doing everything fine.
---
&gt; Newsflash, games have always been about the money.
---
"Being about the money" and "being solely about the money no matter what" are not one and the same.
---
If you say "it has always been that way!" then how come that today there is a shitload of trash projects from huge company while 25-20 years ago every their game was a masterpiece?
---
It's a long con. 
---
Nice video. I have a question, what would stop someone from going ele 1-60 and keep a staff at all times? You frontload your spells and then earthbind kite to finish mobs and get mana back. Seems hard to raise AP a significant amount for str gear to matter. Just a thought. 
---
&gt;Enchanting. Smoking Heart of the Mountain. Of course, once you craft it, you can always drop Enchanting and go with anything you want.
---
Thanks
---
Exactly this. Is it so hard? From memory that what happened back in the day as well. GM's would only intervene in the most extreme of circumstances, which usually happened in master loot scenarios.
---
In-game achievements is just another thing that kills the social aspect of the game.
---
I know it's subtle and hard to understand, but saying "yeah, I killed Nepharion" is different than linking an achievement which is 100% verifiable.
---
The less automated and curated things are, the more organic and genuine they become.
---
Vanilla WoW is like life before selfie-cam facebook instant gratification app mentality.
---
You talk to people, know people, see the same people, do tedious things while enjoying the outcome, etc.
---
Achievements is just another step away from this core dynamic that every single one of the expansions added to WoW.
---
You gotta pay for quality talent when it comes to C-Suite personnel. Besides, do you think a CM's paltry salary means anything in the context of millions of dollars? The two aren't related. The CFO's salary is just the price of doing business when you're talking about billion dollar companies.
---
We've been fucked over so many times by blizzard that it is only natural to expect it once again.
---
Yeah, the single point of contact between the community and Blizzard was laid off, but **fuck us** for being "downers" about it, right?
---
When Activision Blizzard spits in our face we should just rub it in and call it aftershave.
---
World PvP, both while leveling and end game.
---
Did I read somewhere that they'll be ditching the one-off charges for expansions so your sub will give access to everything future WoW has to offer?
---
Well this didn't age well.
---
Is there a different specialization to tribal LW?
---
If so am I missing out on that other one?
---
Thank you!
---
&gt;Access to allied races involves completing story elements and reputation grind. Player base loudly complains it is too much work.
---
To paraphrase a video I've seen on a similar topic: Blizzard has chosen an audience that doesn't want to invest itself into the game. Of course they're going to complain when they're suddenly asked to invest themselves, but as they're not invested anyway, their feelings are not indicative of the game's actual quality.
---
After all, all of the streamlining the game has gotten started out with some complaint or request. LFD, LFR, Transmogrifying and so on were all things that were frequently asked for during vanilla, BC, Wrath, but when they were implemented they made the game almost objectively worse and correlated with subscriptions dropping.
---
As a game designer, one just really has to know to ignore many, many complaints. Every good game was made by a few talented people that knew what's good, none through design by committee.
---
Also, I wouldn't call allied races a proper RPG reward. It doesn't give your current character anything, instead it just unlocks the ability to make a new character with certain looks. It's a reward for altoholics, earnable through something that altoholics don't like to do. Honestly, "make a new character and go through the entire awful leveling experience all over again" doesn't sound much like a reward to me, unless you want to pay for a level boost or a race change.
---
Fear mongering and cynicism gets shit done. The more autistic and unreasonably loud you are the higher chance Blizzard will react. Compliantly waiting for your turn and circle jerking together with blizzard changes nothing. If you are worried about the future of Classic, voice that opinion as constructive as possible but please do voice it! 
---
It comes down to Pallies Vs Shamans.
---
Pallies are best defensive healer, shamans are best offensive healer. This drives the meta
---
I was going to joke and say alexensual but that made me way too depressed. 
---
Is all of that really just BfA though or is most of it also applicable to Legion?
---
It sucks. Blizzard used to be for the gamers by other gamers. Yeah they paid their employees of course, now it‚Äôs for shareholders at the expense of gamers. I really hope classic release is awesome. I have no desire to play retail. Just giving a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù player base the game they desire without fucking with it will generate revenue. If it plays out like runescape, the classic version might overtake the retail version.
---
It's very worrying to see record profits for investors while my beloved games I use to play are a sad pathetic shadow of the once great games I loved. 
---
It's clear profit for investors is now the major driving force behind Activision not making games for players why is why player engagement had/is falling sharply. 
---
These money driven moron's don't seem to get that ripping your player base off in the short term for profits is not a viable option long term. 
---

Don't expect gold from it. It is a drain even maxed. As with most other crafting profs the money's on rare recipes at best. Its focus is utility, becoming sort of a swiss army knife with devices and consumables for all situations. 
---
For gold we still have Maraudon princess farm (doable even with low gear) and later on DM tribute (if it's not nerfed, it is quite OP) both doable solo along the second profession specially if a gathering one. Fishing's also there if stuff like FAPs and buffing foods are used extensively (several fish required).
---
Then equip it and trade it later ?
---
Lightwell :D
---
Blizzard always walked the line correctly. You made a great game you got great profit's. 
---
Yes we had to wait some times but that just drove our excitement. 
---
Now what we see is Activision rampaging every ip they own to deliver more profits to Investors. They loose subscriptions let's add more mounts to the shop then let's add more rng to the game to keep people playing longer. While we are at it let's add rep vendors with shit rewards and pointless to get to exalted because they are obsolete so dam fast. 
---
Let's take another beloved IP and make it a mobile game that has a brilliant micro transaction store but hey we have been doing ok with micro transaction's but let's kick it up a notch and get a company that specialises in this oh and while we are at it let's use one of there existing games and just fucking reskin it more profits for us. 
---
OP by defending this action by Activision you are infact a large part of the problem they are destroying our beloved IP's and your happy with that. What I have mentioned is only the tip of the iceberg go and educate yourself and stop being the problem FFS.

Thus leading to sells , thus money. Not hunting for advertising, audience or selling skins and mounts .
---
Activision is about that, let blizzard make games again, for real.
---
Same I was 16. About to turn 31.. 
---
Amazing for 5mans, only good in raids as an OT and even then situationally. It's a path for the ultra-dedicated if you plan on raiding as one.
---
Warlock and Mage are both good choices. Hunters have a hard time getting into raids casually. For Alliance, Warlocks have the easiest time finding spots from my experience.
---
Better than Tipsout
---
Yeah they are going to backpeddal on a company wide restructure announced to the market because a few thousand neckbeards signed a petition 
---
same as they did with a 15 year old game
---
Bfa made shit tons of money and did so with smaller staff on it than in the past if experienced devs leaving is anything to go by. 
---
God I can't fucking wait for classic. 
---
Other games are absolute shit and nothing interests me , I *might* pick up kh3 though.
---
They never announced that to the market as a cost saving measure.  Irrelevant comparison.
---
F&amp;F betas are always known to be going on since TBC
---
I know right. For now we only play ‚Äòthe waiting game‚Äô. 
---
For me it‚Äôs Classic, Cyberpunk 2077 and Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord. 
---
I think it will be a great opportunity for newer WoW players to finally understand what people were talking about when old-school players discuss what they miss about Vanilla WoW. 
---
(Personally, I've played about 3-4 months worth of WoW since mid-cata because I didn't like the constant class changes.)
---
I would honestly prefer they remade WoW from the ground up with better graphics. I play Guild Wars 2 nowadays, and am looking forward to just two new games: WoW Classic, and Amazon's New World. I'm very much an MMO player by heart and soul.
---
Don't you think it's not even worth a try? Costs nothing
---
Again, I am trying to be constructive on a day that a lot of people are arguing about the CM leaving us (see WoW forums).
---
You think private server trihards aren't making it to 60 and clearing each raid day 1. Beyond delusional. 
---
So you don't know that classic will allow trading of needed items, you are just speculating yes?
---
I've started on a pserver. I think that classic will be delayed. Level 15 now.
---
It's pointless but knock yourself out. 
---
On other news, a Fury Warrior in tanking gear does it better than a Druid. 
---
&gt; Most guilds won‚Äôt have the luxury of being picky with tanks so they‚Äôll gladly take a skilled bear. 
---
Most guilds will go past BWL. Skilled bear or not, the spots for a bear tank in Classic will be almost non-existent. Sure, you might see a couple bear tanks per realm, maybe 3 or even 4...but that will be about it. Bears that will tank in raids I mean.
---
There will be plenty of bears tanking 5 men and 10 men, and the occasional 20 men. But 40 men raiding...not so many.
---
Not to mention that the few Druid tanks on private servers that tank in 40 men raids are EXCEPTIONS, not the rule. Those players have the support of their guilds (guilds that exist for like 4-5 years), and even so, those Druid tanks HAVE TO WAIT until after AQ40 to be actually a semi-proper raid tank.
---
Tin foil hat as fuck. Classic doesn't have nearly the earning potential of majority of over actiBlizz titles and mentioning it at all would spook analysts  
---
Seems like whatever Blizzard does nowadays, they will always have people to defend them
---
Reason it wasn't is because in terms of overall revenue it isn't seen as a driver in any meaningful way.  0 upfront cost and hard to know how many subs it gets. 
---
A game without upfront cost as 0 chance of being a major revenue earner. 10 million classic subs per year adds sub 3% to overall revenue 
---
Let me answer your question, with one of my own.
---
Why are you not sceptical of Blizzard at this point? You must know BfA is doing, how every other Blizzard game is being put on hold and how Blizzard management has been acting the last few years.
---
We both know 2019 Blizzard is a shadow of it's former self. I know I want a classic that tries to replicate the classic of 2004, but I also know Blizzard would sell their own mother for a dollar.
---
For the Horde!
---
/spit
---
They're not tryhards. They're the kind of people who like talking about vanilla more than playing it and can be found in every comment section going "uhm, ackshully" to everything. 
---
At the very least, those at make it to 60 aren't leading any raids, and any that do stressing spec viability over mechanical competence and commitment isn't getting very far.
---
The release date, so I can finally stop having anxiety and stress over the game that isnt even out yet :(
---
You're beyond delusional and are going to cry come classic. 
---
Yet you answered to a comment who was talking about the "passion project", so understand my confusion.
---
"nobody played it" Where did you get that info ?
---
"lot of hype" since when hype pays the bills ?
---
The truth is : if it doesnt make ENOUGH money they'll shut it down. And hype is completely irrelevant in that, because hype never lasts.
---
Rarity alone doesn't make the reward psychologically worth it for most. It is also important  that you having achieved the reward can be recognized by others and have actual value. Gear is best in this regard because it can be easily recognized by others but also because it has tangible value and is not just cosmetic. Achieving gladiator used to mean something other than cosmetics - you got 310% mount while others had to do with 280%. That feeling of  reward that is very exclusive, very recognizable and gives tangible advantages is just the best. Getting some cosmetic title in single player game? Not so much.
---
Think about it, if there is challenge X but only you would ever know that you beat challenge X then it would be worthless. Since there is no world and you are isolated, for many people it creates this feeling that you won't be recognized for the reward anyway so why do it. 
---
I must have hit the nail on the head because that sure got your panties in a twist.
---
The citys are quite nice.  I really like the starting zones and quests.
---
I think you will enjoy Alliance aesthetically.  I've done both sides and swapped a few times.  
---
I felt alliance much more immersive when I first played at launch but now I know so much about that game its just a memory now.
---
I also felt alliance was more fleshed out in terms of quests but I do love the undead starting zone.
---
Different people have different opinions, I do say if you have not played it you are in for a blast as something new.  
---
I didn't play until WoD as I was 4 when this game came out so I missed truly experiencing Vanilla and hope to enjoy Classic as much as I enjoyed a üëÄ server.
---
Lol enjoy being wrong your entire life :) 
---
But we can't taxe the weathy, that's communism!
---
Assuming Blizzard doesn't burn itself to the ground beforehand I'll be enjoying Classic and not giving a shit what you want to believe.
---
saves mana - vanilla Pally tanking - drink baby drink 
---
&gt; All of this makes for a much smoother leveling experience but it also removes all the fun from it
---
Exactly. But if those features remove the fun from it, why would I miss them?
---
Ask yourself, who would dislike performance/progress metrics? People who don't progress and don't perform well, that's who. Random baddie sees a PUG forming, wants to join it, doesn't realise that the people in the PUG are way further into the game than he is, and he gets frustrated and blames the system instead of trying to find a group more fitting for him. 
---
I've never seen well geared people complain about gearscore, or good dps complain about recount, or people who clear raids in 2 weeks after release complain about curve achievements. 
---
Private server raids tend do be highly overtuned and still druid tanks manage well. Classic will be a lot easier so druid tank should be even more viable. 
---
Stuck between two very different classes honestly, Dwarf Rogue or Dwarf Priest. I like both quite a lot.
---
I like Rogue because its got fun RPG elements such as pickpocketing, stealth, lockpicking and poisons. Its also a DPS who presses more than 1 button. Kinda more exciting to receive loot on a Rogue than a Priest IMO, a better sword has more impact than a better staff. Am not fully into the PvP mindset though, and their levelling may be challenging. Plus the class will probably struggle with high competition. 
---
For Priest, I find them to be super smooth at levelling, easy to play and quite fun in dungeons, plus even in world grouping situations, healing makes you useful and feels more impactful than a DPS. They also have cool spells and tricks of their own like shadow spells, mind control, buffing people etc. 
---
CoD and Candy crush made them a lot of money. Just wait, when they get that diablo immortals released blizzard will make a TON of money, a lot more than currently.
---
The fact is that they will keep minimum number of staff maintaining the servers and in GM support. Keep cutting it before the outcry will start to hurt their bottom dollar.
---
Simple as that.
---
Bear isn't used because it has good numbers but due to things like:
---
* warriors want to dps instead to offtank again
---
* using odd leather/alike gear drops with tanking stats valuable only for feral
---
* generating more threat, benefiting from not being a humanoid in specific cases
---
* can swap roles to somewhat-of-a-healer during raid run
---
I'm not saying it's a good thing or defending blizzard, I'm just telling you that while you think they'll never do that, they are already doing it !
---
Right now if you get 5 reports on retail you get autobanned. That's it. You may not understand or think that it's stupid (like me) but that's the actual fucking game.
---
Lately I've been considering rolling shaman, mainly having casual PvP in mind, with raiding as means to an end to get gear. I was thinking if running both pve and PvP in 30/0/21 spec (healing raids, ele for PvP) is viable, as I'm concerned about constant respec costs.
---
Also, seeing there's not much mail gear with SP, would I have to compete with clothies and wear cloth to PvP? Wouldn't that make me even more vulnerable to melee?
---
20% more on development tho.
---
Fuck yeah capitalism!
---
There is no Stage 5.
---
They won't do it. The office jockeys have decided that their bonuses are more valuable than the lives of their employees. A petition won't do anything. For one, it sets a bad precedent from the company's viewpoint. Their hiring and firing practices are now governed by mob rule? No. The only way they would cave is if they thought hiring him back would save them money, so unless you are willing to go to the mat and not resub for classic (as well as convince several thousand people to do the same) a petition is just screaming into the void. Sucks but it's the truth. 
---
I've lead PUGs during WoD. A shit ton of PUGs. People who have the curve may be carried scrubs in disguise, but they usually aren't. If all your group has the curve achievement, you're way more likely to finish the raid than if you just recruit anyone who claims they do 10 billion dps on the stormwind mannequins. 
---
It's a popular way to filter players because it can be verified quickly and it works. Doesn't matter if one or two people cheated their way into getting it, you can afford one or two bad players in a raid. You can't afford spending 10 minutes looking up everyone who whispers you for gear/enchants/logs/whatever else you want to base your recruiting off of. 
---
I was 13 back in 2004 :) And i started because i was just a Fan of the Warcraft Franchise. I was total Warcraft III Addict before WoW launched.
---
Well, initially they did refuse because they thought we thought we did but we didn't...
---
But then it turned out we did...
---
Reading comprehension, mate. Look it up. 
---
Yeah, if you (i mean others) have followed whats been written about blizzard the old game studio died long before activision deal. Because they had already changed, they accepted the deal. Blizzard as its so renowned, they abuse that to the max. Pay sub industry level salaries just because they know ppl want to work there. This has been going on for a loooong time.
---
Funny that its not seen by the gamers, its "all activision". So they can lying to themselves that their loved company isnt there anymore. 
---
&gt; WE ARE THE ONES WHO MAKE THEM EARN THE MONEY. 
---
Sadly that are the mobile gamers now.
---
I know its not wise to combine drugs but wow and pod goes perfectly together.
---
They took our Moon!
---
Druid. Increases your chance of both thunderfurry and hand of ragnaros. Only negative effect is that you cant have flying form.
---
&gt;Pointless achievements like "looked at a rock five times" or "got Exalted with Bloodsail" (zing!) are bad because they are the lowest possible form of gameplay - perform a totally pointless repetitive action over and over again for a totally pointless display of pixels
---
Dude, loads of content in WoW is perform a totally pointless repetitive action over and over again for a totally pointless reward. As long as the brain orgasms a bit at the end of the repetitive actions, it's worth it to a lot of players.
---
I actually like the achievements. Like exploring every single zone fully or do a book reading hunt. Achievements like this are incredibly difficult to do without some kind of automated checklist. 
---
Most people on this sub who work probably pay more taxes than Activision-Blizzard as a company
---
Dwarf rogues are rare and awesome.
---
I'm looking forward to doing and skipping quests as i please without worrying i might have missed some for the zone quests completion achievement.
---
The cool thing is that if you work and pay taxes, you paid for it!
---
Turns out the decapitated head of Diablo in the bed-trick scared'em
---
I have been full on the classic bandwagon uptill now. but my enthusiasm for classic has taken a hit by the ongoing decisions by Blizzard, these last week tilting my perspective on classic a bit for the first time. 
---
Why lay off the most popular community manager, such a low investment high reward asset. Not even taking the bad press into consideration. It's quite baffling.
---
You might argue, most player don't even know this person and just play the games, it does not matter in the big picture. And this holds true if such things happen sparingly. But iongoing decisions like this add up over time, slowly chipping away at the fundament of the company, ultimately funded by the faith and willingness of the players. *If they lose the hearts and minds of the players, blizzard will fall.* 
---
Seriously, in my eyes blizzard has failed so hard the last three years. They have done NOTHING exiting. The last thing they did that had some vision and balls was the release of Overwatch three years ago, but still not a major success. 
---
New characters and remasters is nice and all, but it's just milking IP's in the easiest way possible. Blizzard has nintethousand god damn employees. Where is next big release with VISION, BALLS and PASSION. Where is the follow up MMO we have all been waiting for? 
---
Sometimes I think blizzard is run by corporate shells managing blue and purple haired SJW's who are fucking each other up the ass with their Wacom pen's.  Where are the dark, hard-hitting artists and devs from old. Where is the gold damn metal music.  Sorry /Rant
---
Am I the only one seeing this as potentially positive?
---
They are cutting what is essentially marketing people rather than the actual developers. The exact thing people have been complaining about is that the marketing people had too much power. It looks like a re-prioritisation, which will definitely mean that some aspects mean that users will have a worse experience (less updates on projects from CMs, etc) - but if that means that they have more resources to actually develop games, that might be an advantage.   
---
We know that there are no big releases in 2019 (except Classic obviously being big for us here), and we know that Classic (from Blizzard's side) is a smaller passion project, and not as such a business priority, so their need for marketing people is lower for the foreseeable future.   
---
This could mean that once the people actually working on new titles are actually further, then they start re-hiring, but only the necessary roles, so that game development is the focus, and the marketing people are just there to inform people about the game, not to decide the features of the game. This could be an attempt to get back to the old blizzard way of working, where great games are the only focus.  
---
I'm not saying that what I wrote is what is actually happening over there, I'm just saying that there are very different perspectives on this, and that we can't really conclude much before we know what they are in fact working on. 
---
Record growth means 15m for incoming executives and 800 regular employees being let go. America in a nutshell! Ya‚Äôll need to unionize ASAP.  
---
It ended
---
The Blizzard we knew and loved has been dying since the end of Wrath at least, say 2009 in my view.  Classic really is my last great hope for the IP.  
---
Yet, I have this feeling of impending gloom.
---
&gt; Dude, loads of content in WoW is perform a totally pointless repetitive action over and over again for a totally pointless reward.
---
Thus my crack at people who farmed Bloodsail rep. I can't say I'm a fan of it, I think it harms a vulnerable subset of the gaming population and adds nothing of value to the game.
---
I realise that the distinction between the totally pointless Bloodsail grind and the Timbermaw grind, to pick one example, isn't completely clear-cut. But at least the Timbermaw grind does get you an in-game benefit that means something and can be obtained no other way.
---
&gt; I actually like the achievements. Like exploring every single zone fully or do a book reading hunt. Achievements like this are incredibly difficult to do without some kind of automated checklist.
---
I certainly don't see how they do any harm. Letting people make sure they see all the content seems like a good thing to me.
---
Bye Bye Activision Blizzard. 
---
Warcraft 2 til WoW WotLK.
---
It was a nice ride but you greedy fucks are destroying everything. 
---
Can someone PM me a good europoean Vanilla P-Server? I'm done with Blizzard. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why everyone thinks tanks are such a rarity. In actuality, I think you‚Äôd find tanks struggling to find raid spots where they aren‚Äôt acting as a dps and in reserve just in case the main tank dies irl or something. 
---
This has been my experience with undocumented servers
---
Discord invite has expired, but this sounds very interesting to me.
---
I've been raiding on a pretty high level when I was younger and took another run clearing Naxx on the Warsong Feenix server in the guild Omega.
---
How often do you intend to raid and are you interested in the absolute end-game? :)
---
//Awix - Warlock
---
Ok, I can agree with this :-)
---
After yesterday's earning calls and layoffs, as much as I hoped for a good Classic product...it's over.
---
Firing GMs and CMs means that automated systems that exists in Retail today, namely right-click reporting and loot trading will, 100%, be in Classic.
---
It also means that ActiBlizz is cutting costs all over the place...which probably means that sharding will 100% be in Classic.
---
And because ActiBlizz made record earnings in 2018, with the LOWEST player base (in numbers) , EVER, it means that they made those profits almost exclusively with microtransactions and player services, and not from subscriptions...which means that CASH SHOP will also be in Classic.
---
Looking at those 4 points alone (right-click reporting, loot trading, sharding and cash shop) Classic WoW player base will have NO PROBLEMS with LFD and LFR.
---
I am sorry, but short of a MIRACLE, Classic WoW is dead. 
---
I used to play dwarf hunter in vanilla.
---
Troll female frost mage in pserver.
---
Starting to dither on what to choose in classic.
---
As Sterling put it "they don't want the money, they want ALL the money". Such is the sad state of most of todays "AAA" studios..
---
Love that tide pod
---
I'm not so sure that the community's perception of druid tanks will be as hostile as you make it out to be. Druid tanks had a bad rep in vanilla because for quite some time, they really couldn't tank, since bear form simply didn't add enough armour. By the time 1.12 rolled around they were perfectly viable tanks, but the stigma remained in place. Nonetheless, by the end of vanilla there were guilds using bear tanks in raids, though it took until BC for the perception of druids to fully change. 
---
That was 12 years ago though. In the time since then, there's been a lot of discussion, experimentation and theory-crafting going on. There's plenty of info out there, be it in [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOGCaOhCZvo) or [articles](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) that paint a very positive picture of Druids tanking. It should not be forgotten either that many of the people who will be checking out and potentially playing Classic are retail players, and Druids have been recognised tanks there since Burning Crusade. The community won't be operating with the same level of stigma that was around in vanilla, though there is some residual bias against druid tanks still lingering around. 
---
I'd argue that succeeding as a druid tank isn't going to take a monumental amount of skill.  Succeeding as a Feral DPS in raids is much closer to home on that once since you have to power-shift and farm Manual Crowd Pummelers. But as a tank it's really quite simple. Once you know what gear you need and what talents to pick (and that information is very widely available) it's just a matter of knowing how threat works. Then it's just spamming Maul and using Swipe as a rage dump. Druid tanks honestly have it easy when it comes to what they actually have to do, especially against single targets. 
---
You are spot on when you say that social skill will be important. But that applies to any class really. If you know someone's a good tank, you're going to go on a dungeon crawl with them, just like if you know they're a good healer. A bad tank will be bad on a warrior or druid. A good tank will succeed on either. 
---
I kind of liked the social parts of classic WoW that you actually had to trust people. Also ninja looters were kind of known in the server and at some point never invited in good parties anymore.
---
They were so much fun. I remember SH, Arcatraz and Shadow Labs  better than any of the dungeons from later expansions. I really hope they will give us a choice at some point to go on and do BC again.
---
Some zones, such as Azshara were underdeveloped. Winterspring had a few more quests, but also felt like something was missing.
---
Ahn Qiraj, while a great concept, cool event and solid design, was also *hideous* artistically. AQ20, AQ40 and Underbog from TBC are probably ugliest looking instances/raids in WoW. The enemies and bosses look fine, its more the zone of Silithus and the raids themselves that look unappealing 
---
I actually love the simple raid encounters, it was designed back then when people didnt posses 90 addons telling them every single detail about every single second of every single fight. 
---
Too few Black Lotus 
---
its unlikely hes not using loopholes.
---
They ditched the one-off charge for everything but the latest expansion. BfA will be free after the next expansion is released.
---
That's no moon.. 
---
Ghost pirate ship in wetlands. 
---
Everyone is self-interested, so that type of extreme greed at the top isn't surprising.
---
What is surprising is that any consumers support Blizzard anymore. 
---
People used boss mods as early as MC. Not that you needed since most bosses did absolutely nothing but it still existed. 
---
&gt;Non-viable specs
---
This isn't even true unless it's restricted to performance in endgame PvE content.
---
Anyway, I think that Vanilla's greatest objective flaw is that 40-man raiding and "simple rotation, large toolkit" class design are directly opposed to each other. Vanilla 5-man dungeons are really fun because each class has their own set of wonky abilities that can turn the tide of the battle. Druid can switch between roles. Hunter can trap, off tank using his pet and kite. Warlock can fear, off tank using his pet or even switch pets mid-combat for utility if specced DS. You get the idea. However, 40-man raiding doesn't really let you make use of that toolkit. Because your large swing plays aren't really so swingy anymore when there's 39 other players to pick up the slack, you end up spamming one or two buttons. 
---
The concepts of 40-man raiding and "simple rotation, large toolkit" class design are both fine separately, but they just don't really work together.
---
Thats not capitilism lmao.
---
However capitilism would allow us to punish this company for being so nasty by not paying them for the goods they provide. Somehow I doubt that will happen.
---
It's actually disgusting. No one person should be able to mass such wealth. All that tells me is the system is vastly broken.
---
Weirdly scarce mobs for a quest that requires many. This happens quite a few times in the early Human starting areas, where you need to collect 15 of X, but they're so localised and have such a small spawn rate that if there are even 2-3 people in the area doing the same quest you would be better serviced just leaving. This is only an issue with collection quests as for kills quests you just group up. Just upping the area these mobs can spawn in and populating a bit more would be welcome in this regard. 
---
Another small thing would be chests. Love finding a chest, rolling for a chest, and seeing what goodies are inside! But we have all had the scenario where we crack open the silver seal and find a single Dwarven Mild sitting there stinking up the joint. I would have it so that after the time elapses that would have respawned the chest normally, the chest simply replenishes with another random set of items. The refresh countdown would only start after being looted once. Alternatively, a little button that allows you to "close" the chest after taking the rare item out of it, that simply destroys the chest and its loot, letting the chest go on its respawn countdown. 
---
Kind of how Jagex did with old school runescape for a while after release?
---
Grinding Gear Games seems to be a good one. But other than those guys......nobody else springs to mind.
---
&gt;Hot take: they don't want to talk about Classic WoW because they're hoping that they're able to portray its success as a success for WoW in general
---
I've been saying this since they announced that the sub will be the same for both.
---
Get out of here with your facts and sense!
---
This i understand, but they also said they're cutting costs to maximise profits along with 'we will start to communicate more'  
---
Basically actiblizz doesnt care about the players, they care only for their money and to see how much they can stuff in their pockets  
---
The recent 2018 Earnings call shows that they truely are shifting most of their resources to mobile games and that they will start hiring more people to mass produce these games (They also said they're making a mobile CoD game this year along with transitioning more of their original IPs to mobile)
---
All in all, fuck modern actiblizz
---
Telling OP that they don't have a basic understand just shows how much of a basic understanding you have.
---
Yes please go to your dear private server. We dont want your negativity here sir. 
---
14. I was heavily addicted to War3 custom games, mainly Dota, and Diablo 2. 
---
WoW cured me by giving me just one, better, addiction.
---
Why is Classic news/leaks always in German? 
---
For me the two biggest flaws of the vanilla era - *and the reason why it's not my favorite WoW moments* - are the very poor class balance, especially regarding hybrid classes and, something that was not an issue for me 15 years ago but turned out to be my biggest disappointment when playing on vanilla servers recently is the raid difficulty being non-existent. Both because of a severe lack of significant boss mechanics and vastly superior theorycraft that resulted in a massive powercreep, turning most encounters into a 30 seconds DPS rush training dummy.
---
I can't say I'm looking forward to raiding again in vanilla when Classic comes out because speedrun clears of outdated and undemanding raids are just not exciting to me. At least untill spicier raids like AQ and Naxx come out in later stages. However I will probably raid nonetheless as a mean of getting gear but focus on the PvP aspects of vanilla, hopping for better days eventually (aka TBC servers at some point in the future).
---
Lack of quests while leveling which necessitated arbitrary grinding.  
---
I am going into this with cautious optimism. Everyone knows that Blizzard is doing this for the money, there is no question about that. They are a business and that's what businesses do. The question is what chances are they willing to take to make more money. They know that they straddle a very fine line between trying to make as much money as possible and alienating the very people who will support their product and stop it from failing.
---
In the end, I do believe that they're going to do it maybe not one hundred percent perfect, but very close. If they don't, I will go back to private servers and I am not negatively affected one way or another. Blizzard on the other hand, will lose millions and millions of dollars developing a game that no one is playing. They understand that the risk is much more on their side than ours.
---
Yeah, right.
---
Imagine what a nice work atmosphere it'll be when you come back to the company that fired you.
---
Is tipsout such a bad streamer for this kind of information? Heard him say that there will be huge infos yesterday. Although it wasn‚Äôt about Classic 
---
Well, we have a thing for old empires.
---
because we love old shit
---
At this point the company is run by accounts and not game developers. Accountants do not make great games....
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs any new information in there
---
If you don't plan on raiding, and you were used to prot wars and monk/DHs...
---
You should play druid. You can do anything in 5/10 man and PvP without respeccing at all (use the 1/29/21 build and farm gear sets for the different roles)
---
Dear J. Allen Brack
---
FUCK YOU. You / your corporation is destroying lives because the CEO, CFO and all those measly investors are not getting "enough" money. Stop trying to sell this as "we want to make it better FOR YOU, GAMERS". All you're trying to achieve is make it better for the pockets of the aforementioned greedy bastards. That's all.
---
So yeah, J. Allen Brack - FUCK YOU
---
You literally couldn't make this crap up. The company is beyond disconnected. It's just run by accountants now. Ythisens was the one guy in the whole company that gave me a bit of hope......and they sacked him.
---
Going to take time off work. Buy everything I need before hand and rush to the endgame.
---
Why this rush?
---
Because last time I played vanilla I did alot of exploring and taking my time for everything. This time I'm going to be ahead of the curve, and be the guy I always looked up to, the guy I wanted to be.
---
Dawn of the first day
---
For the Alliance, dude.
---
True. Plenty of tanks for raids but all tanks gear up so fast none wants to run dungeons.
---
I don't disagree with what your saying, but I also have had zero trust in the company for along long long time. Ythisens, although not overly present, did give me hope in the game. Without him, I'm back to zero trust in the company again.
---
I would say the horrible imbalance of priest racials affected me greatly personally. I wanted to play a human priest but was always made to feel subpar because of how strong dwarves were.
---
Aside from that, the pvp system in general should never have gone live in the way that it did, as it promotes unhealthy gameplay and is overly punishing if you stop even for a week. I would personally have liked if each new rank you got you got to keep, without decaying below it
---
Pretty much, im far from a rogue expert but I haven't seen any farm spots that are comparable for rogue.
---
Ahhh thanks for clearing that up.
---
The only thing I'd change is maybe nerf the consumable grind a bit.
---
I'm actually tempted to not get the game, as a form of protest. I can't morally buy from a company I think doesn't deserve it.
---
This is really well put
---
They probably cashed in on that Classic demo.
---
It's true. I am terrified that they will ruin WoW Classic if it's directed solely by accountants.
---
The only good thing I can say about TipsOut is that he is good at talking and can articulate what he wants to say in a well spoken manner with an easy to listen to voice.  
---
But the other things that I don‚Äôt like is his Patreon and money grabbing attitude. Go check out his Patreon page and look at what he‚Äôs asking for, it‚Äôs laughable. 
---
He also got triggered because another content creator called Alexensual commented ‚Äúlmao‚Äù in jest on Tipsout video and Tipsout notified the police because he felt threatened. I‚Äôm not even joking here, this actually happened. 
---
Overall I just see the man as someone who never even levelled to 60 originally who tries his best to be informed but will never have the knowledge and experience as people like Esfand or Alexensual.   And the way he asks for money from people annoys me too. 
---
You need new friends.
---
Aside from the things already posted by others: people should be aware that playing a druid tank in vanilla can feel very unrewarding depending on the player's expectations. Not just talking about loot but also playstyle etc.
---
&gt; Easy raid encounters (for today's standards)
---
As someone that raided 2005-2006, the raid encounters were not easy back then - not with the knowledge we had then.
---
&gt;iongoing
---
I see what you did there!
---
Exactly the same. Honestly, I didn't trust the company at all. In the end I started to trust Ysthns (or whatever he's called), but now they have sacked the one person I had trust in. The company is just run by accountants at this point.
---
It‚Äôs really easy to sort out who‚Äôs worked in this setting and who hasn‚Äôt. If you think a CEO and a Game Dev are the same value you‚Äôre hopeless.
---
Being a CEO and guiding a multimillion dollar company is an insane task, they don‚Äôt just shell out this money for 0 reason.
---
Exactly this: bear tanks were really quite bad in vanilla up to the Druid talent review in 1.8. By that point all the serious raid groups had already filled their raid slots with Warriors tanking and with Druids healing, and geared them as such, so while the viability of bear tanking might've improved in late vanilla it was never really demonstrated.
---
TBC shook things up: the move to 25-man raiding shook up raid teams completely, the option for Horde Paladins and Alliance Shamans led to a lot of people re-rolling, and there was an influx of new players. 
---
I would never argue for a Feral MT instead of a Prot Warrior MT in classic, but I'd be really, really interested to hear the argument when/why a Fury Warrior OT is a better choice than a Feral OT. It's clear from pServers that this is received wisdom among those players, but I'm not entirely sure why.
---
prolly true 
---
valid reasoning
---
Classic will be more like that than private servers with 40 elitist theory crafters in BiS wondering why Gehennas dies quickly.
---
Yeah, they were not back then. For today's standards they are very simple and easy though. 
---
But back then, the few mechanics that were in place were enough to just wipe out everyone and it was anyway more about preparation, gear-check and consistent raiding.
---
Agreed, maybe it's not a flaw of vanilla then. Would be if vanilla was released today.
---
But you contradict yourself, sir. Female orc dance is superior.
---
But that also opens a really awesome door... With the release of Classic comes the NewClassic private server options. Don't want to give Activision money? Play a private server. Some Russian will do the right thing:)
---
They don't have to be passionate about classic, the content and everything is already there they just need to get it running and fixed to how it should be. Their direction makes no difference to classic unless they change more things, which they've said they're not going to. 
---
ok
---
They just need to release it and that's it. Stop being dramatic.
---
Draenor is free! 
---
&gt; it's restricted to performance in endgame PvE content.
---
Yes, but it is. Endgame PvE content is significant part of the game and as later expansions have shown, it is possible to make the classes viable even there.
---
Another point for me is also how paladins worked - for endgame content they were only viable as healbots, although there was no optimal paladin gear for this role, so they had to wear cloth... Definitely not designed that way on purpose and could be fixed.
---
Hey. The current plan is to raid 2 days a week. We'd be happy to have you.

Dear Mr. Brack,

Fuck off.

-Literally everyone
---
I was 19, which makes me all sorts of old now.
---
&gt;I realized Blizz/Acti was shooting for lowest common denominator back
---
You should of realized this on the day of launch. The game is so solo friendly that you can get to max level without even grouping with other people!
---

---
nice pic, did u make this OP?
---
If you did dungeon quests you would have more than enough so to level without grinding.
---
Didn‚Äôt Activision pay $370,000,000.00 in taxes  to Sweden just for their purchase of ‚ÄúKing‚Äù on its own? That‚Äôs not including everything else...
---
I seriously don't see the problem here.  If this video encouraged someone roll a mage to try out a PoM pyro build, that sounds awesome to me.  
---
Expectation management is not my responsibility.
---
More revenue does not mean more profit. I am no expert, but if you spend 1 000 000 and you revenue is 1 100 000, that would be 100 000 profit. If you spend 2 000 000 and your revenue is 2 050 000, that is 50 000 profit. Twice the revenue, half the profit. If you grow and spend more and gain more revenue, yet profit goes down, it is a problem, especially so if you expect certain profit and make decisions based on that expectation.
---
However I do not think this actually applies to them as they were quite profitable. Losing Destiny might have been a huge problem to them though, and it might have been unexpected. Destiny is quite profitable.
---
Agreed most CEO‚Äôs and executives are total workaholic psychopaths. Whatever system you put them in people like that end up at the top because they are manic workaholics.
---
You hurt me even more
---
Cool, see you at launch.
---
I really do.
---
Haha
---
You may think he wasn't meaningful but the thing is he was the only one capable of giving me the perception he was willing to engage with the community and that he cared.
---
Sometimes that kind of attitude is much more important than detailed cold information you can give, because that attitude is what can calm community's worries and earn their trust.
---
Aq and naxx gearing are my biggest bearbugs. Aq40 had loot that meant nothing for a lot of classes despite requiring so many consumables, then naxx was the reverse, with even trash loot eclipsing everything else before it.
---
Technically Blizzard did not merge with Activison. Activison merged with Vivendi Games to become Activison-Blizzard.
---
I always wondered too... maybe?! 
---
It is a great quest but my gripe with it is just how broken the ship aggro was. Still, By grabbing a few friends or maybe some nearby levellers made the completion of the quest all the more satisfying to complete. 
---
&gt; typical daily radio update about Shares &amp; everything was built around blizzard &amp; how they fucked up &amp; fired 900 people...
---
Saying that they fucked up by laying those people off depends on your perspective.  A lot of people seem to be missing the fact that the company's stock went up by about 4% yesterday.
---
When people start to realize that companies aren't your friends.  I know it's sad they don't have that family business charm anymore, but that went away a decade ago.
---
Play the game if you like the product, don't if you don't, and stop taking everything personally.
---
later expansions have shown that characters lose all identity if you streamline their specs and abilities to make everything viable for all content.
---
&gt; Would be if vanilla was released today
---
No, because people would still need time to work out the mechanics, get the necessary gear and theorycraft the BIS gear/specs
---
Same here, only had to pay 1/3 of the price. Big brothers can be very useful ;)
---
Same as speed reducing talents. Good question
---
Because they're not your friends.  It's a company and it's far easier to defend profit margins than what ever warped reality half this sub lives in.
---
You're taking business decisions personally.
---
Yeah. This is just impatience. 
---
Now if he was pointing out that the game is going to suffer with the ridiculous additions of loot sharing, sharding, right-click reporting, battle.net, and the same servers that struggle with 20 vs. 20 then I'd say he's got reasons for pessimism. 
---
&gt; progress with a normal PUG group and get a legitimate kill (which is what you're against)
---
No that's what people should do instead of trying to join a farm pug. Join a normal progress pug instead, with people on your level who hasn't killed the boss already. 
---
&gt;Your entire argument goes to shit the moment you realize that getting multiple kills on a boss is absolutely no indicator for skill, performance, ability, etc. 
---
It absolutely is an indicator for skill, performance, ability, etc. It's not a guarantee for either of those, but there is a way higher likelihood of someone with curve knowing the entire raid than someone without. 
---
&gt;Wouldn't you feel that the diploma requirement is bullshit?
---
It's still better than picking employees purely by how much they earned in their previous job, for example. Which is what could be an alternative to checking for diplomas. Like, if we follow this allegory, the equivalent of removing achievements would be to not issue college diplomas, essentially giving college graduates no proof of their education, making it irrelevant when applying for jobs. That doesn't sound very ideal does it?
---
I'm not saying achievements are a perfect representation of actual player experience. It just gives us a better approximation of experience than we would have without any achievements at all. Since we would in that case strictly have less information to go on. 
---
After yesterday's events my wow social group is now banking on that
---
It ain't gonna be the same this time around.
---
Volunteer firefighters and policemen I hope
---
In vanilla, you wear your achievements.
---
You're right - it means they are essentially saying that there are no good prospects to invest cash into, and that they are better off handing cash back to shareholders than investing in video games. They believe investors will earn a better return through buybacks than actually investing in the business.
---
It's a problem that most maturing companies have, and is theoretically the next logical progression in the lifecycle of a business.
---
As a side note, this is also what is happening in the USA with the corporate tax cuts: instead of companies taking the cash they avoided paying taxes with (through lower tax rates) and investing it in their own businesses, they are cutting jobs, increasing dividends, and renewing stock buyback programs. Most of the major banks are doing this.
---
Not even 48 hours after launch of Classic will he be back.

You really have to pick up the stonetalon FP if you don't you need the Azshara the flight which makes north south  incredibly long.

---

---
**Racials**
---
They have been a perpetual bane on the game skewing the high end and inevitably the entire mythic raiding scene is irreparably Horde because racials pulled enough guilds to Horde. It's now irreparably damaged because the good but not amazing guilds are constantly shifting Horde now because they can recruit better players as Horde now has a much larger portion of mythic raiders.
---
The second reason and more important reason is a failure to understand that MMO games are about players and avatars. I'd rather see a dwarf rogue and know that player likes to play a dwarf than that player being a dwarf because stoneform is strong.
---
Everquest had egregious stat differences based on race where there was an objectively correct race to play as a warrior. The stat difference was massive based on your race choice. WOW doesn't have this and the idea of a gnome warrior tank would be impossible in Everquest but in WOW the difference in stats between a Tauren and a Gnome is tiny at max level. This brings the question of why they didn't remove race differences completely and make it a purely cosmetic choice where people can play a race based on what they enjoy and now have to worry about the impact of stun resistance.
---
**Shallow PVE gameplay**
---
It's incredibly shallow but it wasn't at the time where the concepts were new to many players.
---
**The lack of writing**
---
You can tell WOW was a game where a world where you could run around and kill mobs was the highest priority. That was expected of MMO games but it's very obvious how little writing there is in the game and how little flavor writing. ESO does this considerably better but I am not a fan of the lore book dumping that happens often there.
---
Writing is an opportunity to tell stories. It can describe details that could not be seen in the copy pasted structures that make up.
---
I'm not surprised this wasn't included. World of warcarft does not come from a lineage of the text heavy isometric roleplaying games like Planescape Torment or Baldurs Gate. It comes from the MMO lineage of murderhobos running around murdering things for more power which has a lot more in common with Diablo.
---
**Shoddy quest structure**
---
Kill 10 boars. Go back hand in quest. Now go kill 10 dire boars that were next to the boars you just killed. Go back hand in quest. Now go back and kill the boar leader.
---
It's shoddy structure where all of that could have been completed in a single quest and would have had better flow.
---

Yeap, there's also Elemental Leatherworking, and Dragonscale Leatherworking.

You're only allowed to specialize as one, and once you do, you cannot unspecialize it unless you unlearn LW all together and get 300 all over again.

Same thing happened to Westwood in 1998 - EA bought it, sucked the IP dry and dissolved the studio.
---
"Is she a mean girl, or a regular girl?"
---
murderbywords? not the guy u responded to, but the idea of streamlining specs.
---
There are some intangibles connected to it which might finally give them a break from negative PR though. I think it will be one of the few positives this year for them. 
---
This layoff was the final nail in the coffin for me. I have been looking forward to Classic for so long, but now... No. I'm not giving them money. Not a single fucking coin. Unless they drastically change in the coming years, I'm done with Blizzard and Activision both.
---
Due to not being a vanilla player myself, let me release this detailed class guide that some other guy made and gave me the green light to post here in order to fund my YouTube career. 
---
Investors will barely give a shit and they'd certainly not see that as earnings call material 
---
1) Itemization.
---
could literally fix allot of the "non-viable" specs, as well as balance, since class specific items can bring a genuinely under-performing spec up to par.
---
also someone above made the camus argument: 
---
2) "it ended"
---
I was seven. :-) Worst rogue on server (didnt have poisons, DIDNT USE slice n dice...) - still, i was the best equipped one (maybe server top 5)
---
The feature that will DESTROY classic wow! 12 minutes of a non-vanilla player talking about right-click reporting.
---
Is there something like a reverse bucket list? Things you'd rather die than do? 
---
Because they will need to re-hire all \~770 people that got fired. They can't just re-hire one person, that would lead to a complete shitshow.
---
Potentially, but it'd be better if Blizzard collapsed on its own and not under the weight of Activision and Activision's own shortcomings.
---
That's not how I remember it. They bought Blizzard around in 2008, when Blizzard was godlike and could do no wrong. Then, like a switch, everything Blizzard stood for went out the window. WoW became a casual paradise, they started selling mounts for REAL money, SC2 was announced to come in three games, Diablo 3 launched with a real money auction house, etc. All the bad decisions happened after the merger. 
---
Honestly , it just felt like reading 10 Reddit posts .
---
Ahhh The saltyness sounds real. I heard alot of Alexensual, positive and mostly negative. But calling the police because of a comment, well this is the same level of ignorance as Alexensual. 
---
Well, I have to sub and unsub at the same time. Guess i‚Äòm lost now. See you in hell(fire peninsula)
---
Are you saying Tips didn‚Äôt contact the police? 
---
All I hoped for was something about classic, oh well maybe next time
---
I don't understand how they will throw Classic in as part of our WoW subscription, surely there's something we don't know?
---
Perhaps $5 a level?
---
Revenue is not profit. That is the entire freaking point.
---
Let's say you have a lemonade stand. Last year you spent 10 dollars and made 12. Your revenue was 12. Your profit was 2.
---
This year you spent 1000 dollars and made 1002. Your revenue is record breaking! 100 times as much as previous years!
---
Your profit was 2.

No you're not. You are buying the stock from the market, not from the company. They aren't seeing a dime from your purchase.

I will come back in 8 months, you should have keyboard turned and clicked your way to 60 then and can see just how badly your face gets stomped in PvP by those Pserver players. 
---
So I have thought a lot about this recently. I keep wondering if it might be the case of the chicken and the egg.
---
I agree with your point that it's the connection, the *people*, that made the original WoW what it was. I still remember some names from my first two years in Vanilla. I sure as hell can't remember who I am playing with now in BfA. All I care about is their class and their output. 
---
Gaming as a whole has evolved. People have started getting used to being connected to everyone (think smartphones, the way Discord/Steam/Bnet is on your phone) all the time and this bleeds into gaming as well. People have a set group of friends that they want to play with, and whatever the randoms in their group do is of no concern. The chat doesn't matter because you're talking to your bros on Discord. The trade chat doesn't matter because you are browsing reddit in the meantime. I can keep going but I hope you get the gist.
---
Sometimes I think it is not that we are being forced into changes made by Blizzard, but Blizzard is just following the demand of the players. If it's too hard to get into a game, people just leave the game. There is no in-game community that pulls them back. Communities are now overarching and not necessarily inside a game any more. WoW used to be 'the world's most complicated chatroom' but now that chatroom is everywhere, all the time. So it isn't WoW's or Blizz's fault that the social interaction is gone. We've done that ourselves! :)
---
Yeah, but I never said anything about that. 
---

---
Being a streamer with a name writing a comment like ‚Äûlmao‚Äú to another streamer that has a name seems ignorant to me. It‚Äòs like a colleague that you harass
---
&gt; My one regard over classic wow is wether it will ever move forward in patches
---
No.
---
I‚Äôd say itemization for hybrids.
---
Finding good gear as a druid, paladin or shaman can be challenging since you literally need almost every stat; (yes, even if you are feral/melee you still need some mana).
---
This is a tough one to balance too, since adding items too strong with so many stats can break pvp.
---
It‚Äôs fixed somewhat later in the game, with pvp, aq and t0.5 sets, but still a greater difficulty curve than, say, finding items as priest or warrior.
---
I think I‚Äôve finally left WoW, I resubbed in December and maybe played a total of 3 hours. IF I sub to another game it will be my original MMO (Everquest) until Pantheon is released. 
---
they said they have no big releases planned for 2019 tho...so...
---
 "So wowkin, wowkin, shard by me, oh shard by me" - Ben E. King
---
Your second point is very subjective, I love AQ and Silithus just because they stand out so much. The other raids are all typical fantasy tropes, but AQ is sort of its own thing, mashing a desert setting and Egyptian inspirations with giant bugs and Lovecraft monsters.
---
I'm not saying you should love it, just that it's a very subjective statement.
---
You're not wrong but this is also the third post (nearly in a row) about Blizzards degraded community feel.  What John Staats talks about right at the beginning of his diary is how grossly out of touch the average player is with the development process.  The simple answer is unless you've got yourself a seat in the executive board room then you've got no real perspective on why things are happening they way they are.
---
Laying off staff that don't contribute to game development in a company that makes games isn't a personal attack.  Blizzard has always been secretive about their development process 'until it's ready.'  I think we lost a community manager for a game that isn't out yet.  Again it's business, not personal.  The guys getting a severance package and keeping all his benefits.  If he's your friend, follow him on Twitter or schedule a dinner date but don't sulk around because Blizzard doesn't behave like a 40 man shop of developers because they're a multi-billion dollar corporation.  Just swallow the pill.
---
&gt; Don't you think it's not even worth a try? Costs nothing
---
why do you even ask if you don't want any backlash? just create your petition and see for yourself what happens.
---
But they clearly have a misunderstanding of revenue vs profit. 
---
Clicking skills in pve in vanilla do not make a difference for most classes. Do not over state the importance of keybindings in pve. In my experience the average retail player playing on private server is just as bad (or good) as the average vanilla player. Computers are better, so less FPS issues.
---
I'm with this mindset as well. I've loved Blizzard since I played Warcraft 2 when I was like 7 years old. Throughout the years it was always nice posting in forums and actually knowing who the "Blue Font" moderators were.  That was different era and times change, for the good and bad.
---
I always loved Activision **games** since I played Tony Hawk 2 decades ago, but I never loved the Activision company. That is now who Blizzard is.  They will still have great games for the years to come, but I don't think their community will be the same, not since the founder left.
---
But there will be new companies that rise up.  Hi-Rez hopefully gets more popular and starts putting out some new really great IP's. They had some bad news recently with an employee, but they handled it well and they are a really tight knit company and community.  They remind me of Blizzard 20 years ago. 
---
I hope people who will stream/make videos will do some with a lil bit of those old school songs. For nostalgia.

Well you couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. 
---
Nice naxx robe, I'm envious.
---
Murlocs are misunderstood 
---
Well yeah, coz Gimli an shit. Dwarves are greatest!
---
Pocket?
---
I don‚Äôt see any. I love vanilla exactly as it is. 
---
My biggest fear is them introducing race changes, faction changes and the wow token. if they do, private servers will thrive, and Idc about the people that respond to that saying 'yeah well private servers won't exist because they will be ruthlessly pursued by activision!' - there's nothing they can do to stop eastern private servers, and they will massively succeed if classic fails.
---
I'm in regular touch with many of my guild mates from tbc/wrath.  
---
So looking forward to this in classic again. Nice screen =\]
---
Nothing wrong with such items, rogues and war can still use it.
---
I think that Classic is going to be included for the first year or so which will boost Retail WoW's numbers significantly.
---
Then the upper management will notice it and ask questions.  At the moment, the upper management of Acti Blizz are probably barely paying attention to Classic WoW, for now. 
---
Do you think there will be realm forums? Realm forums were a big part of classic wow.
---
If not we can make our own!!
---
I always liked being a priest for the help I can give others.  Buffing them as I go, and it's an awesome feel to land a heal on a random players who's just about to die while fighting or fleeing.  Strangely enough our guild recruitment is stacked on priests and still recruiting rogues.

I cant wait for Nostalrius 2.0 with accurate data that Blizzard will provide to dataminers.
---
Duid healer or lock for someone who has absolute MAX 12h/week?
---
I'd assume there will be. The forums were my homepage to my internet browser. I remember after I'd gank someone or have an awesome pvp battle/bg battle with someone in the horde. I loved to see myself being called out in the forums.
---
Usually it would say how bad I was or how I'm an asshole for ganking, but I loved it. 
---
Mostly because they are, competition and adversity make you a better player. Im an old-school wow player and even just comparing my mechanical skills between expacs would show incredible growth or comparing the average pvp skills of the average player between battlegroups.  Until the midpoint of tbc I was still using a and d to manually turn sometimes  and my keybinds were a mess, lots of people (including a few guys I ran arenas with for a short while clicked about half their skills. Its comparable to a guy who shoots on a pool league compared to somebody who is the best in their group of friends. Its not saying that the lesser skilled person is inherently worse or that they are incapable of getting to The same skill level its merely saying that they never needed to get to that skill level to succeed so they never had to. If humans had been born with wings we would probably have never bothered creating many of the awesome innovations that we have. In a similar vein the content was so easy in vanilla that players were never forced to evolve their tactics.

effective tax rate is lower on 30 million than 23k. after all the write offs and loop holes. yes he pays more $ on the 30 million but its like half the percentage that the poor person has to pay.

Your armor is so cool!
---
Well, I would argue it was not the case (yet) in TBC. I think there can be balance found between streamlined specs (Legion) and not viable specs (Classic).
---
Actually, it wasnt a Activision Blizzard merger. It was Activision Vivendi merger. They just killed off pretty much everything else from vivendi other than blizzard (making a killing with wow at that stage).
---
First, people complain that ActivisionBlizzard is too big, now they complain when it gets smaller. I don't care about Customer support, community management etc. never needed any of this while enjoying everything from War1 to Sc2. Give us good games, lore and an editor and we'll do the rest ourselves, as we always have.
---
he said the edit was a typo.
---
i said he added the quoted sentences at the edit, as in the initial post end it with "extremely idiotic".
---
totally two different things were talking about here :)
---
yes OP is asking thisüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
You seem interrested so yes, try it for a month and see if you like it.
---
&gt;their races were ugly (Trolls)  
---
The phrasing made me chuckle. It's not like orcs, cows and dead people are lookers either. I'm torn choosing a faction because I love the Alliance cities and lore, but I can't pass the community of the Horde.
---
They can also get some of their best items very early on, with the Warden Staff, Mark of Tyranny, and Smoking Heart of the Mountain.
---
A lot of people are going to downvote you sadly.
---
But I honestly agree with everything you said 100% 
---
Once they have to cut costs classic will be the first thing to cut if it ever comes as "classic" as promised (No shop, token etc)
---
They even stated it's a "passion project" and if anything get's its budget cut it's "useless" stuff like that.
---
I hate to be that guy but I doubt classic will be a success on the long run, it might be ok for the first 1-3 years but after that retail will probably be dead and WoW as we know might change drastically. 
---
[mobile gaming sadly is the future if it comes to making $](https://thinkgaming.com/app-sales-data/)
---
Best reply by far.
---
&gt; Play the game if you like the product, don't if you don't
---
And I believe this is the main reason big game companies turn into what Activision/Blizzard is today. People keep playing and buying their shit, including lootboxes and in-game merch, while simultaneously crying about the big bad shills at the top and constantly complaining how sucky their favorite game company has become.
---
My understanding is that Classic comes bundled with the subscription. But you're absolutely right, I will personally boycott Warcraft 3 Reforged because of this and, depending on the news on Classic in the upcoming months, I am considering sticking to private servers instead of playing Classic because I don't want to support ATVI-Blizzard's behaviour in any way.
---
nice ui
---
The good old 2min Mage.
---
Hi all. I am going to create a char with solo play in mind (as my time is very limited these days!). Probably no raiding, or minimal at best. My main aim is just to have an enjoyable and leisurely levelling experience, perhaps with some PvP thrown in. I will be going Alliance as that is likely where all my friends will end up. 
---
I played a Nelf Hunter back in Vanilla and although it is tempting to do so again, i think I‚Äôd rather try something new. I know Warlocks are the other big solo class people mention. That is high on my list. But what do people think about Paladins for solo levelling/PvP. They seem to be thought of as ‚Äòslow‚Äô, but I certainly won‚Äôt be in any rush to get to 60 so that doesn‚Äôt bother me in and of itself! Grateful for all and any thoughts.

Good spot! It‚Äôs probably my rarest item, now that t3 is obtainable again. I wa so happy when hey added transmogrification, and I got to wear it again. 
---
I have very fond memories of Naxx40, I‚Äôll write up a post about the one day. 
---
BFF is "best friend forever" not "boyfriend" . To answer your question though, nobody plays a male blood elf so the answer to that would always be yes. 
---
We‚Äôre not a couple, we‚Äôre best buds.
---
He does.
---
If Classic is a success for 3 years, doesn‚Äôt it make sense to release BC and turn that into 6 years?
---
Are you guys playing on retail or any private servers until Classic drops?
---
I always wanted it on my shadow priest, it's actually my favorite robe model but alas...never got it :(
---
They definitely had a certain awe or mystique about them on my server back in the day, especially when in the full level 60 blue set (Shadow... thingy). You will stand out in a good way. Dwarves in robes don‚Äôt look so good... in my opinion. 
---
You may care about more than appearances, though! 
---
Overwatch is a massive failure technically. It was supposed to be a next gen mmo and had hundreds of millions put into it over 10 years. Over watch was a stop gap to recoup some of that money but I doubt it will ever make up for those losses.
---
We are playing on a private server here and there to relearn some of the quests/turn-in's/etc. Only three or so of us are doing that, however. The rest are either chilling with retail or taking a break before Classic hits.
---
He said it was a dream job. He might be willing to go back. Especially knowing the community loves him. Plus, it may not have been his boss‚Äôs decision to let him go or they may not have wanted to let him go but had to. 
---
I trust Vince zapella the most out of all game devs. He created the best FPS ever made, modern warfare which launched cod to a household name. Quit activision because their evil bastards and made titanfall and now apex which is hitting record numbers the last week.
---
Can you define dead? Are private servers considered dead? If blizz launches and 3m ppl play day 1 is it dead? If it falls to 1m two months later is it dead? 
---
Ppl need to stop being so sensationalist and emotional. Im going to play it regardless if there is no cm or gm or sharding in the starter zones or loot trading. These mean nothing to me
---
If you‚Äôre never interested in visiting aq40 and Naxx, a hunter is. Great choice. They are by far the easiest levelers, and are fun to PvP as.
---
Does a 4% increase in stock value mean we'll get better quality?
---
Seems to me as the value has gone up the quality has gone down.  Sure Blizzard is a company that needs to profit, but it's become more clear than ever that profit is the only goal.
---
I‚Äôm with you op. It never hurts to try. At the very least blizz will see how much we valued him and so will his potential future employers. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to hire a guy who was so good at his job the community actively tried to get him un laid off?
---
SL spec works similar to some Druid builds in PVP; your damage output isn't fantastic, but you have the staying power to grind someone down through attrition. This makes it great for world PVP, as even if someone gets the jump on you, Voidwalker Sacrifice bubble &amp; near-instant resummon + SL, alongside Fear spam and DoTs, give you a ton of effective HP to whittle them down with. Got significantly less use out of it in BGs were a group can still focus you down pretty quickly, but solo or duo fights are your niche.
---
I don't wanna to be that guy but I'm gonna be that guy.
---
Should've been Lore.
---
He wasn‚Äôt doing it to harass him though. Tips over reacted for sure.
---
I was 30, single and child-free when WoW launched. Now I'm married, have a kid, and like to think I'm still 30-ish (just with a fairly big value of "ish")
---
&gt;Does a 4% increase in stock value mean we'll get better quality?
---
No, that's why I said it depends on your perspective.  If you're a  person whose main interest is playing Blizzard games, you would be disappointed.  If you're a shareholder, you're happy.
---
You couldn't trade needed items only greed. This is not an accurate example.
---
It did not work like that at all. If you needed an item you couldn't trade it. 
---
Yes. I remember a video of a female dwarf hunter doing it with improved aspect of the cheetah. I remember she had two icy weapon enchants but 
---
1. I‚Äôve looked for this video for years and can‚Äôt find it
---
2. I tried it myself (around BC?) and failed
---
good, very good. mmos need a subscription fee to keep the trash out
---
Source on Classic Comming this summer? Actually source, no speculations?
---
It was announced at Blizzcon
---
Yeah misread your message, you're 100% correct. Possibly their good PR
---
Wait I didn't even read that. Asking for no 40 man raids? Moron. Reported him.
---
Listen I know that‚Äôs a nice sound byte and I know this is the Activision hate thread, but that‚Äôs just not true.
---
Existing?
---
I injected 3 tide pods into my wiener, I never got so high.
---
Stay on your pservers then, there will be plenty of us playing official classic regardless of these speculated changes. 
---
Try boofing it next time 
---
&gt;Ideally no 40 man raids etc
---
How about you fuck off.
---
Throwing his credit card at ATVI like the rest of us World of Warcrack addicts
---
Same here. List of companies that started out well but just became too corporate and money hungry that we need new and better user-focused alternatives to: Google, YouTube, EA, Activision, Blizzard, Facebook, Apple, Windows, to make but a few. Unfortunately, within a few years any new alternatives will just go the same way if they keep letting the same morally corrupt arseholes take over and make the decisions.
---
This is incredible thanks
---
That is a very slim silver lining. I never played on private servers, until Classic was announced. Since than, I started on private servers. 
---
Sure, after Classic will be released, the new private servers will have a much better Vanilla-like experience. However, this was not stopped me (and probably millions others) to play on private servers.
---
What stopped me to play on private servers, in the first place, was the fact that at any point, that server would close, for various reasons.
---
Even assuming that the server will not close...the main issue of private servers is that very few actually namage to stay populated after BWL, because "new" and "better" servers are opening, almost everyone restarting on those.
---
And I am not going to mention the fact that private servers are surviving with massive gold sellers, gold farmers and many times by selling gear for real money.
---
In other words...while private servers are a secondary option if Classic fails (and it looks like it will) it is not a PREFERRED option for A LOT of people, for the reasons I just mentioned.
---
I am sorry, but if Classic will be fucked by ActiBlizz vultures, as much as I love Vanilla...I rather stop playing ANY ActiBlizz games than playing private servers.
---
Its fun playing on private servers, to squelch your thirst for Classic...but long term, it's just not worth it.
---
I don't get it. I never been in such a position, so how could I? . . .  
---
Do we need multi-billion dollar corporations though? Good games come from small but passionate groups of developers. When was it that anything really good came from a multi-billion dollar corporation? This isn't a rhetorical question, I'm really curious if in your opinion anything good was made by such a large corporation.  
---
Game dev companies need to stay small, and make games with passion and love for their product. When something begins to be driven by greed, it becomes empty and hollow inside.
---
Ugh this hit me in the feels. Westwood games were my favorites after Unreal Tournament and Quake. I grew up on C&amp;C. My next door neighbor and I used to play Red Alert against his older brother and his friend to decide who got to control the TV for the night and pick the movies. We usually lost but would occasionally get a sneaky win, and that was the best feeling in the world.
---
EA ruins everything it touches. :(
---
Well, he‚Äôs been fired. So, soonTM, does not look soon. Since we have no community manager now. 
---
[Bruh.](https://youtu.be/Q6A1RFSTN5w)
---
Was there any world boss, or extremely powerful mob that you could kite to Stormwind? Was Kazzak kite'able? What were other bosses that could be kited to capitals? Maybe Azuregos to Orgrimmar? Any others?
---
You're excaggerating
---
You‚Äôre excavatingly right 
---
It's actually spelt dammit.
---
I can't believe this post excists
---
Just for context, starcraft lots its community manager today too.
---
I am 100% sure I will play a rogue on Classic too, but I still cant decide on the race. My plan is for a healthy balance of PVP and PVE.
---
I am torn between UD and Orc (both female).
---
There are Pros and Cons for both in my head, but convince me choosing your race, 
---
you have 5 minutes, 
---
starting now
---
!!!
---
Arguably, I can see his perspective as a critic or a fan , but as a business ? No way. 
---
I didn't know thecre was a "c" in "thcere"
---
I see where you're coming from, but I believe a true Blizz-like Classic server will last just fine. All we need is someone who truly loves Vanilla to provide the experience. 
---
What kills me is that if Classic fails then we will never see a Classic TBC launch. I think a Classic private server would last a couple years if the option to move to a Classic TBC server was there. 
---
I dunno... But something tells me we will see.
---
So... I am part of the problem? :-(
---
The basic objection to "small" changes is that it's a thin end of a wedge that inevitably leads to "big" changes.
---
Assuming Classic is a success, the two obvious and low-risk, low-cost routes to keeping it popular beyond a couple of years are:
---
1. Push on to Burning Crusade.
---
2. Introduce new fresh vanilla servers.
---
Or both. Ideally both with the option of remaining on mature (but probably dwindling) eternal vanilla servers, with healthy pops maintained with server merges. 
---
Ok I found out what it was. It's on wowhead if you want the spoilers!
---
Undead has, in my view, far more fun early on their starting zones (Tirisfall and Silverpine) are just so much more fun than the Orc/Troll equivalents. They are dripping with atmosphere.
---
Plus, cannibalise as a racial. The ultimate PvP taunt? 
---
Then again, they will be far more common than Orcs. But that‚Äôs because they are so iconic. So UD gets my vote.
---
Also It's called the Cursed Eye of Paleth
---
For Azeroth!
---
That's ridiculous, big studios put out great games all the time. 
---
I was never huge in the forums. But over the 13 years I‚Äôve been playing, many community managers have left, even the good ones.  They will hire someone else who‚Äôs passionate about the position or promote from within.  Life will go on.  Really feel you on the website though. I do remember being able to gather good info from it in the past. I honestly can‚Äôt tell you the last time I went to the current site.  Maybe to preorder bfa?
---
Tbc wasn't balanced at all at the high end. If you were pushing into sunwell early you absolutely had to class stack, namely resto shaman, rogues, hunters, warlocks.
---
@OP if you‚Äôre not a fan of 40 man raids you can always stick to AQ20 and ZG instead.
---
&gt; Why is everyone against this?
---
Because WoW Classic isn't about making the ultimate WoW experience, it's not even about learning from the mistakes of the past, it's quite simply about experiencing the game as it was back then, with all the good and all the bad. Retail is there for people who want a WoW that's constantly progressing, that it's bad at present should not force Classic into a different direction.
---
Some compromises will have to be made of course, but that's largely because of the nature of the project and how Blizzard are doing it, as few changes as possible should be the goal.
---
Now wonder you are just friends if he plays a female BE
---
&gt; Overwatch is a massive failure technically. It was supposed to be a next gen mmo and had hundreds of millions put into it over 10 years. Over watch was a stop gap to recoup some of that money but I doubt it will ever make up for those losses.
---
Overwatch has already earned billions since its release, i very much doubt that blizzard has lost money on the franchise. It earned more than 1 billion in under a year after release.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-has-earned-activision-blizzard-over-1-billion-in-less-than-a-year/
---
&gt; but it's very obvious how little writing there is in the game and how little flavor writing
---
wut?
---
They were. They were the first dungeons with real mechanics. Be it switching up group tactics/rotation for Forgemaster Throngus, using the environment to either become immune or remove buffs from NPC's in Skywall or dragging that one Draknonid boss under the lava stream in Blackrock Descent to open up a damage phase, Cataclysm dungeons required a lot more thought and timing than vanilla ones did.
---
Nah I think dwarf priests look cool
---
I first got this tidbit from the Wowwiki entry for Naxxramas back during the TBC days, but it became common knowledge.
---
Here is a link to the wiki page: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Naxxramas_(original)
---
&gt; With the release of The Burning Crusade, finishing this instance still required 25-30 well-equipped level 70 players.
---
Fuuuuck, I am a part of it too.
---
It was unnecessarily expensive to PVP competitively and take part in 40 man raids on just one character. Dual spec was a great fix to this problem and I'll really miss it in Vanilla.
---
Like you need to bring Holy waters with you when you visit rivendare and throw them at the skeletons when they happen. THAT'S IT. You gotta stun/silence Moira when fighting Thaurissan. THAT'S IT. You gotta kill the mobs that you're in the room with for Darkmaster Gandling. THAT'S IT. Vanilla dungeons took more time and the trash was more dangerous but the bosses were much easier. If you didn't know the mechanics in Cata dungeons you died/didn't kill the boss. For Vanilla it doesn't matter. There are hardly any. I prefer vanilla to Cataclysm but this is objective fact. Cataclysm requires dungeongoers to pay more attention.
---
Did it make up for the rest of the game being garbage? Lol
---
Heroic Deadmines was harder than pre-nerf Arcatraz.
---
Mate it's tchere
---
I will never play classic wow!
---
...so when can i pre order it?
---
i rather they fire the person giving us useless updates than someone actually developing the games
---
Look I get you guys don't like Cataclysm but down voting my comments because you don't like it is silly. 
---
Too often people forget that the average raider was rocking a 5 fps machine with ~300ms in 40 man raids during fights.
---
Probably play something less time consuming.
---
&gt;I will wait for another mmorpg where the devs are really passionate about their game 
---
It's not the devs that are the problem, they probably hate this just as much (more) than you do.
---
Need more parameters. Do you like hots or dots?
---
If you‚Äôre going to make a new post at least be original. At this point you‚Äôre posting the exact same thing for karma for whatever reason. 
---
There aren't that many books but I'm not talking about the lore dump books and instead talking about letters, items and flavor descriptions for world objects. The lore dump books are just summaries of events that happened in the other games.
---
It's very noticeable that later expansions started adding flavor text to junk items, flavor text to bodies on the ground, letters found on corpses. WOD in particular has loads of this stuff in part because of treasures placed around.
---
In particular in Frostridge valley there are two treasures that can be found on two corpses. Both have a letter and two parts that can form an item. The story is both decided to meet in the far north of the zone away from the fighting but the orc died on the way there and the other died waiting for the other to arrive. It's a very simple story but it adds a lot to the world.
---
Many of those were already known information pulled either from Warcraft games or WoW RPG.
---
More so this than pyroblast. Can be done as frost for a similar effect.
---
I plan on doing the exact same thing and raiding / PvP on the 30/0/31 spec... intrested to see an answer on this. you really just give up on mana tide right?
---
Because of the implication...
---
Nah he's a noob.
---
That's why they are laying people off... They've got 9 thousand employees and they can't be bothered to do much more than milk ip, and unimaginatively at that. Got to start a fire under their asses.
---
You view this as a bad thing, I think k it could just as easily be a good thing. Clean the machine and get it running again. 
---
So? They still chose to code those items, write in the lore and place them around the world.
---
I just did part of the AQ Scepter chain and you get a book of lore as a result - so clearly they wrote up the Lore for the benefit of players who take the time to read it
---
&gt; I would say the horrible imbalance of priest racials affected me greatly personally. I wanted to play a human priest but was always made to feel subpar because of how strong dwarves were.
---
Part of me wishes they had buffed the weaker priest racials instead of homogenizing and later removing them all.
---
&gt; The lore dump books are just summaries of events that happened in the other games 
---
Just did the AQ scepter chain, you get a lore book as part of it, so yeah - that statement is wrong
---
It‚Äôs not bad, it‚Äôs greed.
---
ActiBlizz only made over a measly SEVEN BILLION dollars in the 2018 fiscal year.
---
And as we all know, there‚Äôs no way you can have NINE THOUSAND employees with SEVEN BILLION dollars.
---
They bloated over the past years and now the constant erection of investors asking for ‚Äúmore, more, more‚Äù is really bending them over. Because the money ends; so it‚Äôs time to make budget cuts.
---
Who is gonna take a fall for this? Will it be the managers, and chief officers who make the decissions? No , of course not; they just gave their new CFO $15 million just for joining.
---
No it‚Äôs the drones, the people with 30-50k a year. The people following orders.
---
ActiBlizz encompass everything wrong with unregulated capitalism in general (they‚Äôre doing tax evasion as well btw). They are fucking everyone over just for money.
---
Bad? Lol.
---
I mained lock through the majority of vanilla and tbc, so I'll throw my 2c in.
---
First if you want to do serious premade pvp sl is pretty much out, your job is to fight with the main force and Cot healers/hardcasters cc/interrupt high value targets and burn the designated target, very rarely you might play sl on ab weekend and play solo defense on a flag.
---
Now if you are playing in random bgs/ world pvp SL is plenty viable, damage is respectable and you are obviously quite tanky. You still need to be cot/ccing in team fights, most people don't want to deal with you so expect lots of ccs to be thrown at you.
---
However SL isn't all roses, depending on which patch etc SL was dispellable off of you or your pet at various times. (I doubt this will be an issue in classic). Second in skirmishes people love tab targeting so your pet is gonna get dots and the like on your pet. Expect to micro your pet ALOT or they will die to just incidental damage especially as gear scales up (this is less of a big deal with VW because you can sac but you lost tons of utility by not going felhunter). If you go soulburn the pet's dying in combination with sb can leave you in a spot where you need to farm shards alot. 
---
POE is indeed a great game but they have only come out with 1 title in 6 years 
---
&gt;as later expansions have shown, it is possible to make the classes viable even there.
---
Why bold the thing about not making changes up top when you make comments like this down below?
---
Exactly. Im not even sure if an insect hive should look appealing.
---
*Laughs in The Relics of Awakening*
---
I love the downvotes for asking a question and no response. I'm in consulting and if I bring in $15million in sales, why should I not be entitled to higher pay? If I don't bring in those numbers, it's hard to find a replacement that can bring in those numbers and without the sales, no one in the company makes money. Just because you have no clue how much work it takes for CEO/CFO doesn't mean they aren't worth it. You don't think if anyone could do it, they could find someone who would take the job for less?
---
Superior cities.
---
I had a troubled childhood so I started using at 13 near the end of Vanilla, still use to this day. The daily amount I need is a bit less tho so things are looking bright. 
---
That quest is brutal.. I'm pretty sure i never finished it
---
I first burned out on WoW in late Wrath due to chasing achievements for achievements sake. If you let them, achievement systems both define and score your gameplay.
---
I agree completely with OP: "I‚Äôm looking forward to the player-defined pursuit of what‚Äôs worth spending a ton of time on."
---
(I'm one of those people who wants classic to eventually progress to BC and WotLK, but if it does I'm resolved to ignore the achievements system next time around)
---
It's because the will all exit the game if it turns out to be WoW "Activision changes" Classic. So they make an intentional pre-pun. 
---
This was posted by automoderator and is a weekly post... Its supposed to be the same
---
40 Man raiding is a great 'idea' but it stinks.  25 is the sweet spot for me.  Really thought BC introducing 25 and 10 man raids gave us more options or different challenges.
---
The only part if you want the best gear. Yes there are other parts of the game, they just happened to put all the good gear behind raiding. Not sure why that's so hard to understand.
---
People wouldn't make such a big deal about being viable in end game raiding if there were good rewards in other aspects of the game.
---
Backpedaling 11/10
---
exactly. this opens up the doors for a mage to need HoJ then blackmail people into paying for it. some stupid shit
---
&gt; Classic was never meant for Solo Players, if you play Solo you're gaming experience gets reduced A LOT.
---
said absolutely no one, ever.
---
Blizz devs would laugh in your face if you tried to argue this was their intention.
---
how so?
---
only times you ever needed to group was for 5-mans
---
no matter how small the team, companies with popular games have to expand to keep the quality of service at an even remotely similar level. 
---
it‚Äôs ok for multi billion dollar companies to exist, can you imagine how a small team would handle the millions of bug reports/server issues/inquires that just one game like wow or overwatch generate? there would be outrage at gm tickets not being answered tor 6 months.
---
blizzard has an entirely different issue, they are not pushing new product forward and they lagged in the past two years in producing long lasting content for existing product. on a broader level they have abandoned their older philosophy ‚Äúsoon‚Äù for yearly releases, but the releases have been slow, unfinished and unpopular which is why their stock fell, why they have to move money from temp employees to more developers and why 800 people had to be laid off.
---
Enjoying playing WoW again.
---
LUL, I wanna see you doing Deadmines alone, hech even Elwyn Firest's quest were designed to do in party, if you think otherwise you clearly didn't play classic.
---
Make sure you vote for politicians that also agree with that sediment (if you‚Äôre able)
---
I've seen druids tank the imps in MC better than warriors with similar FR gear.
---
Bought bfa and had a subscription until today. It was the first time since Vanilla that I had a wow subscription. I cancelled it because they fired the CM that actually kept us updated.
---
Orc. As far as I know, the Rogue PvP trinket doesn't get you out of Stuns so having that 25% stun resist will be huge. Plus a female Orc Rogue won't be nearly as common.
---
I‚Äôve used them pretty consistently on pservers. Que up and quest. You‚Äôll find a dungeon group, but in rare cases you might need to drop someone and find a healer.
---
Laughs in Dwarf Paladin.
---
It was Vivendi -&gt; Vivendi Games -&gt; Blizzard.

Then it became Vivendi -&gt; ActivisionBlizzard (Vivendi Games merges with Activision) -&gt; Blizzard.

Then ActivisionBlizzard bought most of Vivendi's shares and became independent. So it's not a matter of separating a merger, it's about a subsidiary who would need to buy out the management of their own company from their parent company. 
---
Unfortunately their expectations for it was probably a few billion, with minimal effort put into the game.
---
But since it didn't make as much as they wanted, they deem it a failure, despite being an economic success. 
---
They did. But I do think that was becuase it was fixed and that it wasn't so the first couple of weeks after they added the dragons. Not sure though
---
Part of this is worse on private servers where the ratio between or razorfen warrior and razorfen mystic aren't blizzlike. Random example but yea :) 
---
Nost went in and intentionally changed some of these, albeit without knowing if it was blizzlike or not (for some)
---
It‚Äôs probably bc GMs get paid to just play the game. 
---
My Shamans have always been and will always be Orc.  If I was ever going to roll a purely tanking character, I would go with Tauren...then I would have to roll an Orc DPS Warrior lol.
---
Excels in all PVP except premades.  You can hold flags down solo and help protect flag carriers
---
Yes well they have to keep beating that record.  The reality of it is - they made record profit, and if they don‚Äôt beat that record this year, the company‚Äôs stock will go down. 
---
They make reskins now and meaningless flair items. They made 7.7 billion dollar last year (or 2017?) are we really gonna ptry to collectively still plead ignorance about [why Blizzard could possibly have not wanted to make and don't seem too concerned about WoW classic?](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/world-of-warcraft)
---
Holy shit i triggered the bootlickers hard with one sentence.
---
Awesome ideas that didn't quite make it into the final game. I.e., more campfires, darker nights etc.
---
About the chest thing: chests should just despawn 5 minutes after they were opened regardless of what loot is left inside. 
---
Wouldn't there be a way to do a private server like Diablo 2 does.... They don't seem to care about that at all as long as the host/creator isn't making profit off it... Shouldn't it be allowed? 
---
Lol capitalism is god and gives us all food. Praise be to profits and yay for layoffs. How simple minded can you be.
---
The one person that I thought was going to get a promotion, and they gave a $15m signing bonus to their new CFO. I keep blaming Activision in my head, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre part of this problem or not realistically. 
---
Everyone in here is mighty upset and hating on Blizzard/Activision, and rightfully so, but how many of you will throw the monthly fee into their greedy mouths without thinking twice once classic releases?
---
This is literally the state of the COD community. People bitch and moan, yet they won't speak with their only voice, the wallet, because they are so addicted to the game.
---
I have no problem with achievmenta as long as they are not outright stupid. There are many achievments, not just in WoW, that means you have to do something bad or boring and those sucks. 
---
However I like those those that means you did something extraordinary like ‚ÄùA tribute to Immortality‚Äù that gives you a unique mount that can only be done once per server. 
---
Are there any other bloodelf models?
---
Except they sold out to Tencent, and started pushing out content that was not in line with their original design principles.
---
PoE was a great game, but it's just not a game I'm interested in playing anymore.
---
I vote Orc too. 
---
Another thing to consider is that the WotF racial was a lot better in the past when people made characters blindly, than it is now in classic where there is more info around and people are planning ahead. Most people who roll warlocks specifically for PvP will go horde so that 50% of the population doesnt have an automatic fearbreak. In my experience most of the warlocks that DO go alliance do it for the endgame scaling in PvE (and as such, they arent much trouble in pvp anyways and you dont need WotF lol)
---
The guy below does make a good point though about cannibalize being the ultimate BM taunt lol.. but the stun resist will be bigger I think. You can always spam /sit as needed for BM taunts lol
---
Extremely boring rotations. If you roll a Mage your life will be Frostbolt spam for 60 levels and 2 raid tiers.  
---
It's ma'am!!!!!!!!
---
They‚Äôre not wondering that. They‚Äôre wondering how they can lol Gehennas even quicker. 
---
I cant say because I skipped Legion. From what I've heard from friends Legion was a little better because specs and Artifacts were more fun than Azerite traits and the class redesigns. Seems like most people who hate BFA on r/wow dislike their class/spec more than anything. 
---
Not for 6 months, after making a position redundant they can not hire the same position for six months. By making him and others like him redundant the company is saying it does not need that role any longer.
---
It‚Äôs funny because even today on private servers people are bullied for going human priest. 
---
God damn it 
---
This sub really needs to chill.
---
That's a weird way to say Wastewander Justice
---
This truly saddens me. I really liked reading Ythisen's posts. Very sad about all the layoffs. I'm going to try to stay positive, though, about the changes to come.  We don't know what they are yet, so try not to assume and second guess (that includes my own imagination! lol).
---
((Hugs)) to all of those at Blizzard who lost their jobs. You're in my thoughts.
---
Paladins are are excellent PvP healers, with the ability to cleanse everything (rare in vanilla to do all 3 poison, magic, and disease), blessing of freedom, ranged stuns, and of course plate armor with fast heals. Great support class if you are healbotting a warrior.
---
The slowness comes from the fact that you are basically just white auto-attacking your way to 60... its not a very interactive or fun thing to do. Where as with a lock or hunter you are sending your pet to go start the next fight while youre still fighting another mob, managing more things at once and multitasking, that sort of thing. Paladin is literally just turn on your buffs and go auto attack lol.
---
http://i.imgur.com/oUtUv.jpg
---
So my answer for what you should play would depend on what kind of PvP you meant. If you meant PvP like you could queue up for a battleground and be a healing god, then definitely yes. But if you want to be able to solo kill people 1v1 and 1v2s and do a lot of damage I would advise against it. Ret paladins do not have a slow and they are easy to kite, and it doesnt even feel good because again its just auto attacking. The healer part of it is awesome though if thats what you want :)
---
Hopefully that helps you decide!
---
Could claim enchant/offspec ect
---
Male blood elves are atrocious
---
Microtransactions and dumb people go hand to hand. When you have idiots willing to spend $100-$200 / month in games that do not require any design effort and content...why would you bother keeping 10 subscibers?
---
Sure, WoW , as example, can have 1 million subscribers...but as long as they are spending the equivalent of 10 million subs, why bother design and add content ?
---
The idiots will still buy all the crap from cash shop anyway.
---
So yeah, they did actually had the best year ever...because MTX is the king in today's world.
---
This sentiment while understandable is profoundly wrong. No small company could successfully run WoW on the scale it is done today. I remember the server crashes, the hardware problems and the general issues that use to happen. While there are issues today, this is because Blizzard are using technology to keep their hardware costs low. Back then it was because they simply could not cope with demand and the hardware could not take it.
---
6, sitting on my dad‚Äôs lap throwing shadowbolts in Dun Morogh. I didn‚Äôt really get into WoW with my own account until Cata and MoP, and eventually left mid-WoD. I discovered pservers last year and I‚Äôve worked my way back from wrath to Vanilla.
---
To me, Wow used to be something I bonded over with my dad. Now, I‚Äôm exploring Azeroth with friends from college and people from all across the world.
---
10 years old. I feel so sorry for the people, that I used to raid with in Vanilla.
---
Sidas ooze covered bag in wetlands, that one sucked as well.
---
SL doesn‚Äôt really shine till late expansions like AQ and Naxx when you can get lots of spell power. You will do very poor damage if you are SL spec during the MC/BWL phase. So it‚Äôs kinda not worth it to be SL early on in my opinion in PvP. 
---
god forbid you play what you like the aesthetics of and not just what's objectively best. With that said though, dwarves are so strong that if I ever make an alliance priest again in classic, it'll be a tubby lass
---
It is not a change if it happened in vanilla. but I agree with the first reply, literally unplayable. I think this requires a new video from all classic content creators right now. This injustice must be resolved. ARISE PEOPLE AND REVOLT... 
---
I might be getting carried away....
---
I remember this really well from classic because I got the quest, ran up to that tomb spot and got it first ooze kill. People were pissed. 
---
... it's a space station 
---
I'm looking forward to no flying
---
I WANT IT DOWN IN UNDER 7.87 SECONDS NEXT TIME SCRUBS
---
I gave up for good when the gameplay resolved into stacking 100 of a buff while doing nothing so i could attack once.
---
There are plenty of communist shit holes you can move to you know?
---
Actually I've been playing on private servers a bit and I noticed how easy paladins clear mobs early levels compared to me(casters (did some mage wlock and priest)). Im sure they fall off somewhere in mid levels 25-45 (reason why people shit-talk them) but I don't think its such a big difference. My first char was paladin and I didn't had so much trouble levelling. I didn't know shit but it was fun, maybe drinking every 3-4 mobs but honestly as a priest at lvl 10-15 you have to drink after every mob unless you maxed Life Tap for spirit. They get 10 times better once you are deep in shadow tree but until that I actually believe paladins are the best early leveler. You have basic attack + judgement attack + judgement. Thats 3 dmg spells in 1 auto attack + spell cast. while i need 5-6 secs to do same dmg with immolate + 2x shadow bolt.  As I said, it changes later and paladins fall off but by that time you can do dungeon quests + dungeons and have loads of fun swapping between specs without changing talents.   
---
There is a lot of circlejerk but Im sure paladins are bad compared to hunters in terms of lvling. But is it hell, no.. its heavens once you are 30+ lvl and you see in chat LF1M TANK LF1M HEAL LF1M DPS and you can fill any role without sweat. 
---
This was an organizational/restructuring change. A petition can't bring back these people, unfortunately.
---
There is a difference between unappealing artistically and straight up unappealing. 
---
The Zerg look unappealing, but they are one of the most beautiful designs Blizzard has ever done. They have many insectoid elements to them and especially in the case of Starcraft 1 and Brood War, they are terrifying. Every unit and building however looks *great* in all of its horror. It is tonally consist and there is great use of color and contrast.
---
There is something horrific about Zerg but also natural in a weird way. There is nothing mechanical about them, contrast to Terran and Protoss, its a very raw image of *life* in its glory.
---
Of course not. Running a good business isnt about idling around. Why would they pay people that arent needed?
---
yup - and ultimate goals? 
---
PvP or PvE? 
---
Raiding and Battlegrounds? 
---
Dungeons and World PvP? etc etc
---
Ashenvale, Duskwood, Redridge and Hinterlands will generally have higher-level Horde when you level there. Hillsbrad is somewhat vice versa, but you'll have to deal with the numbers there.
---
Overall leveling dungeons are placed much more conveniently for the Alliance. Running to SM will be that much harder though, and you'll need to complete a silly quest in Desolace first to proceed with the quest chain.
---
Also, Defias Pillagers.
---
My point still stands. 
---
Literally having to level a dps alt so you could farm for your healer / tank main 
---
Or UBRS!
---
Biggest objective flaw is that it was clearly not quite finished. Azhara is the big unfinished zone, but others are pretty sparse as well. Some quest chains are incredibly boring and were probably plopped out in a day, or end abruptly. MC was apparently very rushed, and it shows even though it's a classic experience. 
---
Itemization doesn't make sense in a lot of cases (pallies in cloth, Spirit in general on anything but healer gear), some spells are useless, some specs are too good or too bad for no particular reason. I don't mind if some specs are not raid-viable, but for example Fury warriors being by far the top DPS was probably not intended and not great for the game. It was mitigated in Vanilla because people didn't realize how good they could be, but it'll be rather silly in Classic. Or Prot pallies being useless in any sort of challenging content. Oh well. Still can't wait. 
---
Do you have any interest in melee classes or do you for sure want to choose between one of those 2?
---
Also do you like to PvP? or Raiding? and how high do you want to be on the damage meters vs do you care more about utility like kiting and pulling etc
---
Disagree. Pre-mades routinely camped the graveyard indefinitely to grief.
---
That's why I started my comment out with me not getting it. I'm not surprised I'm wrong, honestly...  
---
I just don't like greedy people, and I definitely am sad seeing the 'playground' I'm loving being trampled on by businessmen in suits...  
---
Do you know what the solution would be, if not staying small? How can we keep seeing passionately built games instead of just constant cash-grabby trash? It's much easier to discard someone's idea than to come up with your own...so since you chimed in, I would be happy to hear how you would solve the problem.
---
Your points are completely disjointed. Laying off unnecessary workforce doesnt mean they were generating those profits.
---
I three would love to see an answer to this. I have never played a shaman past 20 or so, my only experience at max level has been alliance.
---
Got any source for that?
---
Why would race or faction changes ruin the game?
---
I encountered all sorts of problems in Vanilla, but this was never one of them. The people who are dedicated enough to farm the majority of recipes you'll want at endgame are generally invested enough in the game to care about their rep. And, despite what trade chat and global spam frequently indicate, the vast majority of players are going to be decent folks who arent out to just screw you over. Crafting only gets bloodthirsty when it comes to gathering...
---
In fact, the only problem I ever had with any crafter was an Engi I gave a bunch of mats to - I think for the Core Marksmen Rifle. We completed the trade and he logged off 30 seconds later. I was livid, but maybe about an hour  later the guy tracked me down with the Rifle and apologized about 20 times for DCing. 
---
You do know they said they wouldn't be removing and developer positions right? There should be hardly any "budget cuts" to an already small team.
---
Indeed, we will see if support gets to a point where it becomes a detriment, but I havent heard any major complaints before this layoff, so we dont know yet how it will effect support, people are just moaning that a corporation is actively trying to be efficient.
---
Im really amazed at how pro-capitalist Americans are and when something like this happens they get so scared and confused.
---
You can jump over the canal's in Ironforge. That's always fun. 
---
Read my post again - it makes one mention of the layoffs which is what you are focusing on but is more about community reach outs from the team!
---
I knew about Armorsmith and Weaponsmith for Blacksmithing, but I didn't know about LWs specializations.
---
Thanks bud!
---
Thanks for actually arguing the impact of the layoff on the business, even if it was filled with rhetoric on workers livelihoods. 
---
&gt; What stopped me to play on private servers, in the first place, was the fact that at any point, that server would close, for various reasons.
---
No decent private server has just randomly closed anytime in the last 3 years and more than a few of them have reach the end of their life cycle without issue
---
&gt; Even assuming that the server will not close...the main issue of private servers is that very few actually namage to stay populated after BWL, because "new" and "better" servers are opening, almost everyone restarting on those.
---
And why do you think blizzard servers will be any different? They will certainly be releasing new server periodically. 
---
&gt; And I am not going to mention the fact that private servers are surviving with massive gold sellers, gold farmers and many times by selling gear for real money.
---
Those are also things that will plague retail servers
---
Considering you say you are not fully into PvP, does that mean you are 100% committed to PVE and will be raiding "hardcore" style?
---
If you have not played a rogue at top level before and you want to top the meters Human is by far the better choice. You will perpetually be several % below the humans on the damage meters if you roll a dwarf rogue.
---
However, Dwarf Priest is the ideal min/max priest class for fearward and can get you invited to raids you dont even belong on just to tag along and be a fearward bot haha. Human priests do technically have a small amount more spirit than dwarves but the difference is nothing like a rogue who gets actual weapon skill. 
---
To put it in perspective the best offhand in the game for Rogues is maladath which has +4 swords on it... Humans get +5 just for existing. Its literally like wearing an extra item worth of stats, and GOOD stats at that, which raise your crit cap by increasing your +hit.
---
Interesting stuff to think about and it depends on how much you care about being high on the meters.
---
If you like the RPG elements then maybe you wouldnt mind being a dwarf and being the designated "dagger rogue" in your guild, and just passing on the swords since they will be highly contested by human fury wars and human rogues. In that case, Dwarf Rogue would be a great choice.
---
It comes down to the company focus. When Mike and co created Blizzard they were focused on making great games as a way of becoming a profitable company. Nowadays companies look to monetize existing franchises and platforms, therefore the space for existing companies to be able to focus on making new and exciting games will be limited. It is clearly possible, see Apex, however they have innovated on an existing format. However finding the next diamond from a small company is very difficult to see but any new company will be looking to make a good game so that they can get known, but as all companies are either owned or public companies their will always be a trend to make increasing money from a successful game.
---
Oh crap I'd forgotten trinkets didn't break every CC. Thanks for the reminder, that would have been a massive disappointment when I bought my trinket. From memory there were always a lot of explosives being thrown around in PVP so it's worth considering that every class has a stun mechanic.
---
Slow moving NPC's in escorts, it's painful.
---
Why is Blizzard losing profit?
---
Shit, you must be in highschool I am guessing based on your response?
---
Obviously 5-man dungeons need a full group. But those are not a necessity to play and enjoy the game
---
Your average player plays mostly solo and probably a bit of grouping if they feel like it, but a lot of people prefer to play solo and do absolutely fine. 
---
Speedrunners also always play solo and get there by smart quest circuits. So its actually more efficient to play solo.
---
In the end, there's no correct way to play. You play how you enjoy it. To say that the game is *meant* for a specific playstyle is laughable.
---
No.. it doesnt. 
---
This was not a user who made a post and needs to be original, and he is not doing it for karma. Literally nothing from your post is relevent so it does not stand XD
---
Look at who posted it: https://i.imgur.com/BEPFKyO.png
---
But it does. 
---
well, the expansion comes out on jul 2nd, and the raid comes out 2 weeks later, on the 16th, with the hard mode of the raid coming out 2 weeks after that on the 30th. That's been the pattern for the last 2 expansions at least and SE rarely changes things up.
---
Sooo yeah, I've never played a p server but I'm thinking it's the only way to go...
---
Easy - Draenei are still an expansion away. 
---
this is ridiculous fear mongering. I agree that right click reporting, loot trading, and sharding, are all possible and things we should still be actively complaining about. The cash shop and LFD/LFR thing is completely different and there is no chance they would add something that stupid.
---
Customer service reps are like entry level jobs and have high turn over. The GMs can very easily find other call center work.
---
Yeah good points, I think it was in TBC with arenas that they made that change. Everyone reading this should look up what their classes' trinkets can break. Ill try to find some links for other ppl too who read this later
---
Many companies view a round of redundancy as a way to refocus and retool. While the individuals that caught up in the layoffs have a personal hard time, for the company it represents an opportunity to change direction. As shitty as it may seem this is how the corporate world works. They stressed on the earning call about investment in Dev, they means they expect more content and IP's be to created going forward. It makes sense, they are a games company that creates games, the people that create these games are dev. The more games a company has the greater the earning potential and all the investors work off the potential for a big pay day. 
---
Are you me playing on Nost three years ago? 
---
This is a great read. 
---
Oh, sorry. I didn‚Äôt intend to imply that you would. I wasn‚Äôt sure if you had actually played retail in a long time. However I personally don‚Äôt think that every change from Vanilla has been a bad one. I‚Äôll surely curse over a quest or two during my leveling.
---
Yes anyone who has Engineering as a profession has a 3 second "stun" on a 1 minute cooldown thanks to iron grenades. Which are dirt cheap costing usually 10s or less per grenade. I put stun in quotes because it's kind of a weird hybrid where it counts as a stun effect for all intents and purposes (including being affected by orc stun resist racial) except that it automatically breaks on damage unlike all other stuns as if it was an incapacitate like gouge.
---
Is that what we're talking about here? It is not. Why are you taking this so personally?
---
What a simplistic way to be. We know it's not about giving handouts.
---
TL;DR nothing new
---
Why not include talents? I mean even mages can spec into 15% Mana Regen while casting, why not give ele, ret, enh or boomies something similar?   
---
I agree the itemization is poor for hybrid DPS, but the other situation is really just Mana problems right?
---
I love Silithus as a zone. The music and the atmosphere in there is really amazing to me and the sandstorms that occur sometimes. For some reason I remember that zone fondly ever since retail vanilla.
---
I also really like Tanaris though and I think it's nice to have another sandy zone at high level.
---
I wouldn't rate Underbog in the same boat with AQ at all to be honest. Some of the mobs and bosses in AQ are very unique and you never see them outside the raid, but Underbog is just full of Boglords and other creatures you already see in Zangarmarsh normally while leveling.
---
Underbog is more like an underwater cave type thing whereas Silithus and AQ are desert zones so I think aesthetically they're quite different.
---
correct, they compare the experience you have in the barrens in classic and retail, move on to having on Elysium asked why they like vanilla and then have one page about nostalgia and blaming people that they shit talk new games and "religiously" honor legacy titles
---
True, but GMs are the player's primary interaction point between themselves and Blizzard. Loss of these types of people is bad for players. As GM is probably the lowest point on the structure/entry level as you said, these are often people who are fans who decide to try to get jobs at blizz and are probably some of the most enthusiastic people for the products. It just seems counter to some of activision blizzard's recent comments about community feedback etc. 
---
Nice, thanks! Excited to play a Shamie for the first time. Keep up the good work!!
---
That doesn't make this ok though.
---
As a fellow grammar nazi, it's posts like this that get me exited.
---
People seem to have this idea that it's so impossible to balance different racials. But it's really not that hard to get them close enough that nobody would reroll. Give everyone 1 decent utility racial (wotf, escape artist, war stomp), and 1 decent stat racial (berserking, blood fury, weapon skill). Play with the numbers a bit so they aren't so far apart in power, but it could easily work. 
---
Instead they're all over the board. Night Elves have almost nothing going for them, very situational. Trolls have an amazing power boost but no utility. Orcs have the best of both worlds. It's blatantly obvious how they could be balanced better.
---
I really really don't do this usually but damn...
---
OP: https://imgur.com/gallery/DNsXXq9
---
It is a different thing to stack specs for first kills or to stack because you want to actually finish the raid during the reset. For most part of TBC you could afford to take all the specs (not classes) and not be handicapped.
---
Those are their plans yes and if everything goes as planned they won't.
---
But if Acti-Blizz loses share value they'll likely come up with plans to make classic more profitable, be it either cutting costs or increasing income (Tokens, transfers, namechanges etc.)
---
Their PC games are a hot mess right now and while they're milking cash cows like WoW at one point they'll end up as so called "dogs" and players will drop like flies (they already did but every lost player now means a lot more than 8 years ago since WoW players nowadays spend on average much more money than just the ~12$ subscription fee like back in the days)
---
I'm not worried about the people behind classic not taking it serious - I'm worried about the big stock company controlling said "classic enthusiasts"!
---
They did say they will be increasing development employment by 20% this year in addition to these lay offs.
---
If capitalism is so great why are all these game companies goin down the shitter?
---
That‚Äôs just flat out not true. First about 10k isn‚Äôt even taxed then the rest of his income is taxed at 12%. Other dude gets taxed at 37% everything over 600,000. Yes he will have some deductibles but if you think he‚Äôll get anywhere close to 12% (actually less since first 10k isn‚Äôt taxed) you‚Äôre delusional.  
---
Sentiment, too.
---
I feel sorry that you guys still play retail and never managed to transition into a classic server
---
hardly a biased opinion
---
Boys can't even get karma. Of course they do weekly posts. You're like that prick that was adamant the guy who said "PvP at 60" meant rank 14.
---
Now add these types of quests into a higher pop PVP server. WACK.
---
1. We don't even know if Classic will succeed long enough without Activision's interference to even get to this point
---
2. People who have been playing on Private Servers for the last 10 years want Classic WoW to be released.  I don't think the idea that it's the same old thing is going to be a problem.
---
3. Why not TBC?  Everything you want would come from TBC and WotLK being released.  
---
4. We've seen what's happened when Activision-Blizzard adds content to WoW and it eventually leads to what we have on live.
---
5. Too many changes and it's no longer Classic and no longer exists as Classic did, and the whole reason it got started is washed away.
---
So...what is it about the development of Classic that's turned you off to the game?
---
Raiding. I'd do bgs with a pve spec and raid gear so not too fussed about PvP viability.
---
Melee basically means rogue and 50% of players play rogue and DPS warrior which is off-putting in terms of competing for spots and loot.
---
I'm thinking orc warlock ATM but unsure.
---
That would be a tbc spec
---
Nice read, good to get some insight as to what went down there.
---
Cost to Swap Specs  Tanking vs DPS vs Healing specs switching between them costed to much to make multi-specing viable
---
In this sub: "man fuck blizzard an activision we need more of a voice and control in how our games go! They only care about a quick cash grab and other companies make P2W trash."
---
Me: "these companies are in a slow death from being unsustainable in their search for profits. Capitalism sucks and if workers had control of their own jobs things would be better, i.e. this guy couldnt be fired at will for no good reason".
---
This sub as cognitive dissonance sets in. "reeee you attacked our god! We like how shitty things are actually!"
---
I really can't decide and its driving me crazy. I've been a blood elf paladin since i started playing wow in early wotlk and i love the class but since im a stark horde supporter i wont be able to level a paladin in vanilla. Ive been playing vanilla private servers on and off for years and have always levelled a mage since it was fast and simple. But im afraid there will be so many mages in classic wow. Im planning on doing like 80% pve and 20% pvp. Mostly a raider but hop in a BG sometimes for fun. Should i just roll a mage and hope i can still be viable? I've always played as DPS classes. Which dps classes are the best in vanilla and which one is a lot of fun? Cheers and sorry for the wall of text.
---
We Must Secure A Future For World of Warcraft Classic
---
Plan to do a lot of pvp healing as well as raid healing and struggling between paladin and priest.  Pvp is more of a priority for me so I‚Äôm leaning paladin.  I do like how priests have the option of shadow for fun as well as mind control etc, but overall it seems like it‚Äôs hard to beat support/healing pally in group pvp.  
---
Any priests who pvp a lot able to sway me? 
---
Kazzak could originally be kited to stormwind, but it was patched almost immediately.  There are videos on youtube of it.  Kiting Kazzak to Stormwind required a server reset because once there, he was unkillable.  
---
Paladin. Being a bit niche is cool and there will be shitload of priests. You'll be unkillable.
---
This is hilarious to read, it's like you only played classic in private servers, that's the only way to explain how wrong you are.
---
Your average wow classic player mostly does Quest it's true, but most of those quests are designed to be completed with a party, just an example, in westfall most of the quests requires you to get in a party otherwise you'll spend a huge amount of time waiting for spawns or dying because you pulled more than 1 mob at the time, and this happens in almost every zone and the the few quests that were designed for a player to do alone are the ones that sends you to the end of Azeroth to deliver/ask/kill stuff which is way more annoying and more tiresome than the regular stuff, yes you can play the game solo but that doesn't change the fact that almost all of the content was designed to do with other players, that's a core aspect of MMO's like WoW,
---
Take my downvote troll
---
End-game PvE content might only be a big part of the game for you, but it's not for everyone.
---
1. You cannot lose anymore
---
&gt; Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
---
this has not nor will it ever change.  
---
if people lose too often they quit. seldom do people power through and endure.  
---
if the game is too hard then many people lose interest. its the biggest reason why wow was successful in the first place. it was accessible to a large audience.
---
Well, that about does it for me, Private Servers forever now, why bother paying for Classic when Blizz will just make a record amount of money another year, and to celebrate fire another 1000 employees? 
---
&gt;Ask yourself, who would dislike performance/progress metrics? People who don't progress and don't perform well, that's who. Random baddie sees a PUG forming, wants to join it, doesn't realise that the people in the PUG are way further into the game than he is, and he gets frustrated and blames the system instead of trying to find a group more fitting for him.I've never seen well geared people complain about gearscore, or good dps complain about recount, or people who clear raids in 2 weeks after release complain about curve achievements.
---
I boycotted gearscore back in it's heyday because it was toxic and bad. I still ran content fine, and was first a regular raider and then raidleader in my guild.  
---
when i ran pugs i just asked people if they know the content and gave their gear a cursory glance over to make sure they weren't doing anything crazy like stacking int on a melee DPS.  
---
You can be good and still think that shit is bullshit.
---
Also all dat loot options and endless mana.
---
In worried about this too.
---
"The current gearing system, much like communism, is a sweet idea in theory, but it just doesn‚Äôt work"
---
This.
---
And this is why sharing has no place in classic.
---
I am excited for classic, but for me this is the company's last chance to get something right. This is the only thing they are doing that has me remotely excited and If they screw this up at all I will be done with blizzard forevermore. 
---
The biggest issue with this game, and its subsequent expansions is the enormous focus that many players place on being *optimal*.
---
It has reduced a mere *video game* consisting purple haired midgets, furries and Elves into a job, something that has to be optimally performed. This is mostly seen endgame. You see it here already, people cannot just pick any class, spec, race or profession, it has to be *optimal*.
---
The reason Classic was so great, is that it took a long time to get to the point where the game began to feel like a job. You could get months out of playing some weird half Boomkin half Feral a wonky build doing shit damage and having professions that made no sense. But once you hit max level, you either conformed to the machine and did as you were dictated or the game more or less ended for you. 
---
You go from: Playing however you want, whenever you want --&gt; playing a specific way that is optimal, at set hours. Its like going from being a teenager to being a adult.. in a video game.
---
If Nost hadn't been shut down it'd still be the powerhouse Vanilla server.  
---
There are other "biggest" servers for TBC / WOTLK as well that maintain very large player bases despite other newer ones popping up.  If you are the best head-and-shoulders like Nost was, you will stay that way.  
---
Blink. I was always falling through the ground in the gray abyss, or getting caught on an entryway. 
---
&gt; Aq40 had loot that meant nothing for a lot of classes 
---
I'm not familiar with vanilla loot, what was wrong with AQ40 gear?
---
Yeah I do like their toolkit as well plus they have a lot of extra ways to survive.  And as a priest viper sting keeps me awake at night.  
---
anything past BWL level gear.
---
&gt; I think 2019 was just a bad year for them
---
*Was*? This is mid-February 2019 and this is already coming up
---
Or even when you need to kill 10 of something and there's only 3 spawn points for that mob.  So you wait for several respawns.
---
I meant to say 2018. 2019 is also going to be bad.
---
Don't know, no, no, no, next.
---
This guy hasn't worked for Blizzard for some time and then sees his time to write a hit piece without adding anything new. 
---
Interesting use of the term ‚Äúguidance‚Äù here. In general, Forward Looking Statements are the most heavily scrutinized section of any investor presentation. In order to simplify earnings and guidance presentations it makes no sense to mention classic on an earnings call or in their 2019 guidance. That would be blind risk since it is not an individualized product release with an upfront cost to consumers. 
---
Looking at the share price volatility of ATVI in 2018 I‚Äôd imagine it was an easy decision to not include any mention of classic WoW on the call, a free bump in the overall performance of the Warcraft IP will be the only mention of Classic to shareholders. If you want to get your gaming news from Wall Street, you have to understand how products releases are summarized in discussions with market analysts. 
---
One is a steaming pile of shit.
---
I give them a little credit towards innovation with Overwatch, but that's it.
---
&gt; People think that Druids didn't tried to tank back in 2005-2006.
---
1.12 talents weren't a thing in 2005 and most of 2006, that's why
---
&gt; Not to mention that the few Druid tanks on private servers that tank in 40 men raids are EXCEPTIONS
---
Lol wrong
---
Linkin Park and Monster drinks
---
Nice.  WoW at it's best, is a social game and every business decision should be made in support of that.
---
But has Wow/Blizzard been successful lately? Retail sucks and most of their games are on a downward trend
---
classic = good.  bfa = boring/stale
---
Unexisting talent tree's optimization and rebalance. 
---
Yeah 
---
I would open with using my shadow reflector. If you reflect their deathcoil, that makes a HUGE difference. Besides that, I try to keep distance and use scatter/fd/nades to interrupt when they try to fear. I would also sometimes go with the hybrid intimidation/scatter build which was good for keeping locks off me. For traps I liked frost to slow the lock, although freezing trap on the lock pet can be good (seems to get resisted a lot, though)
---
Viper sting can be good vs them, but I found I die from dots while waiting on them to go oom if they have good gear. It works better on the SL locks due to those fights taking longer. 
---
Really, though, a solid warlock is really hard to beat. The big problem is doing enough damage while their dots are eating away at you. They can cast most of their damage on the move while going in your dead zone, so once they are somewhat close you are going to have a hell of a time out damaging them.
---
I‚Äôm not trolling. This wasn‚Äôt even close to a troll comment. But downvotes are cool they don‚Äôt do anything anyway lol. 
---
This made me laugh. 
---
Activision is a greedy as shit company but it doesn't really make sense to have Game Masters when the number of players is decreasing. Also the article doesn't even say Game Masters it says non-development and administrative-related costs. seems to be cuts across the board
---
Caster gear less powerful than melee gear.
---
That depends on your gear score and spec. I honestly think the spell is always the better option. Mostly because if you have good gear you should be beating rogues with or without the resist. just equip your shield. 
---
The war stomp on the other hand can be used for a combo setup or a 1 shot maccro. By this I mean you can combo warstomp to make sure your iron grenade hits multiple targets for full price. Letting you reposition and multistrike with chain lighting. After you get ToEp and ZhC you can actually kill people inside of a warstomp. Shamans are a caster class with no cc. Any CC added to it is game breaking.
---
Honestly it sounds like laying them off helped them.  Blizzard is a shot work place that pays horribly.  I'm sure they will easily find higher paying jobs in better work places.
---
They made record revenue, not profit.
---
I think this is only true for PvP.
---
for old school players, raids and dung will become boring very quick, cuz they already know everything about them(there is nothing new). 
---
Lvling is always boring.
---
And for new players, bfa is also good cuz for them it is still new and not stale.
---
He AdDs ThE mOsT vAlUe.

TIL no video games are made in China.

Lol oh I'm taking it personally? Rofl.

A good number of Americans who play video games are not capitalists and/or may not understand business.
---
I‚Äôm really starting to feel it is unsustainable to be a video game company beholden to shareholders. Shareholders are never satisfied, always wanting more and then the product becomes more about squeezing money out of people instead of giving them a quality product at a fair price.
---
Azuregos was leashed to Azshara, much like the other 40 man word bosses. The reason they were leashed was because someone did actually kite a world boss to a city - Kazzak to Stormwind, specifically. 
---
While Azuregos had a lot of AOE and could terrorize a city, he‚Äôd eventually die. It would be hard because his anti-graveyard camping ability, Mark of Frost, froze you for 15 minutes (!) if you died and then got into combat with him again in a single pull. But anyway, enough damage could eventually be done to Azuregos by NPCs and players that he‚Äôd go down. 
---
Kazzak, on the other hand, had a few abilities that made him tricky. He had a debuff he‚Äôd cast that would heal him whenever he damaged that person, he had a passive ability that healed him for a significant amount whenever someone died, and he had several AoE abilities. He also had what was known as ‚Äúsupreme mode‚Äù, which he entered after three minutes of combat. It caused him to spam his shadowbolt volley that hit everyone in a massive range and ignored line of sight. So if you got him to a city, he would just kill everyone and keep healing himself. Search for the video ‚ÄúKazzak does Stormwind‚Äù and you‚Äôll see him destroy it. He even kills Bolvar in the video. He had to eventually be despawned by a GM. Because of this, Kazzak and Azuregos were leashed and the Dragons of Nightmare were released with a leash on them.
---
There are some other mobs that are/were kiteable in classic. Sticking with The Blasted Lands, there were mobs called ‚ÄúServant of ___‚Äù, four sets of mobs that were located around The Blasted Lands and were involved with a quest. They could only be killed near a stone linked to their spawn location, so if you kited them somewhere, they couldn‚Äôt be killed. They weren‚Äôt threatening though since they were non-elite mobs and didn‚Äôt do anything special. They were just a nuisance since things would aggro on them and just stay there in combat since they couldn‚Äôt die. These were eventually leashed to The Blasted Lands like Kazzak.
---
Teremus the Devourer was another Blasted Lands mob, and he was actually deadly. He was a rare spawn black drake who was boss level and required a small raid group (maybe 10 or so level 60s in blue gear) to kill. He was very hard to kill when kited to a city because he was immune to a lot of debuffs and I believe fire damage, so he took a while to die. More importantly, he had a spell that dealt aoe damage and healed him based on damage done. In a large mob of players, he‚Äôd just heal himself to full health every cast. He would eventually die though because players could overwhelm him with damage between casts of the heal.
---
Anachronos was a raid level bronze dragon outside of The Caverns of time involved with AQ. With enough rep he‚Äôd eventually become a friendly questgiver, but without any rep you could attack him and he wasn‚Äôt leashed. He didn‚Äôt have any abilities and would despawn at 20% health, but he had a lot of health.
---
The Cleaner was a special mob that spawned when someone interfered with the hunter and priest epic quest lines. It was a black demon that was immune to damage and would one-shot anyone. These could be brought to cities through a little trickery, but I do believe they were eventually leashed.
---
Omen, the raid boss from The Lunar Festival, could be kited and had an AoE starfall but wasn‚Äôt immensely threatening overall (as he was meant to be killed with a disorganized raid) and would die to NPC and player damage after a short while. 
---
Jaina Proudmoore could be kited from Theramore to Thunder Bluff or Orgrimmar by the Horde if you had a raid group helping. The reason for needing a raid is because she casts an ability that teleports someone to the water in Theramore. So having a lot of people on her aggro table was key. She‚Äôd engage people and NPCs and could actually deal quite a bit of damage but I do believe errors with the teleport spell interacting with NPCs would cause her to glitch out.
---
Other than those, there wasn‚Äôt a heck of a lot. As I mentioned there were the green drakes around the Dream Portals who had a good amount of health and had aoe damage and aoe sleep abilities, but they weren‚Äôt destroying cities. None of the powerful world raid bosses from the AQ 40 quest line could go anywhere. And there really weren‚Äôt any other powerful mobs or strong enough mobs with unique abilities in the world.
---
I loved kiting though. I never got into it in vanilla since I was a rogue, but I had a hunter alt in BC that I used to kite stuff. There were a lot of fun things in BC to kite. Fel Reavers, the demon packs and the pit lord outside of The Dark Portal, Rexxar for Ally to kite, Danath Trollbane and Kurdran Wildhammer for Horde to kite. Really wasn‚Äôt a thing in Wrath, and then Cata had some brief ones with the Feralas NPCs (Shandris and Orhan) but that was quickly squashed.
---
You serious right now? Have you ever played wow? 
---
What you think is incorrect. Old school players have been playing vanilla for years and don‚Äôt want anything changed. 
---
A lot of it before twins and c'thun simply wasnt very good compared to BWL gear people were already using. 
---
&gt;since they have next to no good impact on our games
---
So why were they hired in the first place?
---
A lot of people seem to think that once you get hired at a place, they have to keep you until you quit or the company goes under.
---
I started 2004 and I never played a Female Bloodelf in my entire Life and never will. 
---
Yes they missed the foot and hit the knee instead. 
---
What you think is incorrect. Old school players have been playing vanilla for years on emulation projects, and will continue to play vanilla when classic launches. 
---
Levelling is one of the best parts about vanilla.
---
For new players, bfa is good because they‚Äôve never experienced classic, nor any other era when was was truly good. New does not mean good.
---
One of the true objective flaws: lack of guild banks. I think this can be safely considered a flaw and not a design decision, because the *Blizzard tolerated* work around of a shared "Guild Bank" character was a direct violation of the TOS. If you are forced to tolerate TOS violations because of missing features in your game, that's an objective flaw. With that said, crack in the liberty bell, wabi-sabi, etc. the flaws make the perfection #nochanges #groupthink.
---
Yeah dungeons get a bad rap on a lot of those 'speedrunning' guides but Cmon people.  Dungeons are fun and a nice break from solo or small-group content.  They're also a good challenge.  A 5-man group can tolerate one poorly played member if it's not the tank or heals, but if everyone isn't at least mostly on point you will go through at least a few wipes. 
---
Case in point, tanked RFD a few days ago.  Had two shaman- one healing and one DPS.  Searing totem was dropped all the time, pulling adds.  "Hey guys, forget searing totem it's not worth the risk".  Continues to drop searing totem. Meh.  I just pulled groups further back so Searing wasn't close enough to adds.  But of course they drop it closer to adds- adds pull - we wipe.  
---
Neither of them had an ankh.
---
1. I dislike the old PvP system, but for some it was not a flaw, and it WAS the game, and PvP isn't the same without it
---
2. For the most part, not an issue.  Raiding is a specialized task where you have to be ultra min-maxed to only do your role.  A lot of the "non-viable" specs are great leveling, farming, or PvP specs.
---
3. More mechanics doesn't necessarily make a raid harder.
---
For me, my issues are (when compared with TBC and on):
---
1. **Interface issues.**  Things like the "showtooltip" macros, being able to mail more than one item at a time, and the AH come to mind.  I don't know if this is a problem with the addon, the API, or the server I'm on, but I can't have Clique and Auto-Self-Cast at the same time.  Can't set auto-loot to automatic.  Need to run a script to get max camera distance.  There's a lot of little things here that can be done a lot better.  I'm not talking about adding in Quest Helper, but things which make your input and your available information more efficient.
---
2. **You have meeting stones instead of summoning stones.**  I don't like it that everyone teleports via RDF, but its easier to find a group if only me and my friend need to make the trek.
---
3. **Some of the really clunky class mechanics that never got used**, such as "Detect Magic" (later you could just see the buffs and debuffs).  While I don't like when a class gets too much of a boost (I was personally offended when druids got Wild Growth in WotLK and at all the AoE healing Paladins got in Cataclysm), there were some needed changes that happened to classes like Shamans being able to recall or cancel totems.  Other things, like Rogues being taken out of stealth by sap (making it horrible in PvE), Hunters not being able to lay traps in combat, and druids not having a real resurrection spell!
---
4. **Inventory management**.  I've personally never found inventory management all that fun, and it's probably the hardest part about starting the game.  It's maybe too easy in WoW today where you have 40 slot bags and everything stacks to a million, but for a fresh character it's brutal.  I don't mind reagent costs and making sure I am stocked on things.  I just don't like that between my reagents and consumables, half the time I only have 1 bag for quest items and BoEs.  
---
One thing I think would help here would be an account-wide bank, something I do not believe they have even today.  (I made a personal guild and used the gbank as my account bank).  
---
5. **Enchanters can't make items to sell or send to alts**.  This may be one that other people like, that enchanting acts like a service, and that you can make a lot of money by setting up shop in IF/ORG.  My issue is less about being able to put things on the AH, and more about that I can't send things to my alts.  For the most part, I only need 1 BS, 1 tailor, 1 alchemist, etc, because I can send those hammers and robes and potions to my alt.  But my enchanter is unable to help my other alts.  At level 60, when I'm enchanting gear I will keep for weeks or months, it's not a big deal.  But an enchanter can enchant gear while leveling, and I can't do that for my alts.
---
6. **Lack of solo level 60 content.**  TBC had the best dailies, because they weren't required and they were a bit of a gold boost.  WotLK and Cata were okay, because they mostly involved grinds that had an end point (i.e. you got the rep you need, you unlocked the pattern you need), but you could keep doing them for gold.  Mists and on were horrible because the dailies were either required for more chances at raid gear, or because the "daily" content was so much of a boost in your gold making that it was pointless to do anything else.  Vanilla, though, had nothing, and I think a daily system was really nice to have.
---
7. **Itemization.**  Gear with 1% crit instead of 17 crit rating, which meant that you could get a piece of gear at level 20 that's basically irreplaceable until you raid.  It also meant you couldn't have different values (i.e. 14 crit rating or 19 crit rating) to get a more granular increase.  PvE being required to gear for PvP.  Some random items with very strange values on them.
---
8. **Roll Balance.**  I don't think that "unviable specs" was a problem as I mentioned above, and someone else covered way better.  But TBC handled tanks the best out of any expansion, and TBC and WotLK had the best systems for healers.  After those expansions, things got too homogenized for those roles.  But in Vanilla, you had druids (for leveling) and warriors, but nobody else.  All the healers basically felt the same, except maybe shamans.  TBC really expanded what classes were available for a role, which was huge.
---
9. **Low-Return Quests.**  Quests which sent you halfway across the world, only to not really do anything and give you 120 XP for going to the middle of nowhere.  Especially if it's a breadcrumb to a quest hub that you've already been to.  Alternatively, quests at a quest hub that you can only do if you've done a breadcrumb.  Which you may not have done because you thought "I'm already over there, why bother with this quest if it's only gonna give me 120 XP."  (There's a difference between a quest chain and something that starts as a breadcrumb).  In Live, you just have the quests, and any breadcrumbs are lost when you go there, but you level so fast it doesn't matter.  I'd prefer a system where if you complete the follow-up to a breadcrumb, you get the extra 120 XP for the breadcrumb, too.  
---
10. **Out-leveling the usefulness of something, but not being high enough to use the next thing.**  When you're a level or two below the next rank of an ability, the ability is usually pretty useless.  A new rank of Flash Heal?  Great.  You'll easily keep yourself alive.  A few levels later and it's a struggle.  A few levels later and you might not even bother.  Then you get a new rank and its easy.  Water is the same way.  When you're level 14 and you have a mana pool of 1100 and the water you drink restores 435 mana.  At level 15 it's 800-some, which at least feels like you're getting something.    
---
Don't get me wrong, I like spell ranks and the strategy that down-ranking provides.  I like that items get better over time and you have the power creep.  I just don't like how useless you feel for those last few levels before upgrading.
---
Because of bad management? Because of bad market decisions? What should we do, pay to keep a failing company or unneeded jobs with our taxes? Should we old the management a gun point and force them to pay for employees they don't need? 
---
To make as much money as they can for their investors, which in Activisions mind generally is turning and burning studios
---
Agreed. This was a long time coming.
---
I do !
---
What is a worker owned company? I'd imagine the CEO, executives, and many other employees of Activision has a substantial stake in their stock. Sounds worker owned to me.
---
This is a great reply, thank you. I have to say that auto-attack fatigue did plague me a bit back in the day (my highest level alt back in the day was a warrior...) so it‚Äôs a very valid consideration that I hadn‚Äôt really thought of, especially as I won‚Äôt be grouping all that much - so won‚Äôt even have the distraction of healing or tanking for 90% of the time. I will have to go and watch a few gameplay videos to refresh myself. Thanks again! 
---
Imagine blaming capitalism for shitty games getting made.
---
There's a term "selling out".  It's when you choose marketability and profits over your art.  You hear about this with some bands.  It's one of the reasons Nickelback is so hated on the Internet - they admitted that the way they wrote their songs was to be generic and marketable, instead of something they were truly passionate about.
---
There's a big difference between WoW Classic, which was a huge open game for players to explore, and WoW live - which is a huge cash shop.  There's a huge difference between Madden 2000, which was an NFL simulation game, and Madden 19, which is a TCG with Madden tacked on (a TCG with a cash shop).  There's a huge difference between Battlefront 2 (2005) and Battlefront 2 (2017).  One was among the best Star Wars games ever created with tons of single-player and split-screen content, the other is a loot-box gambling system (which can be sped up with a cash shop).
---
Games have always been about making money, but it used to be "I made this epic game, let's sell it to others so they can enjoy it and we can get paid for our work," and now it's "how can we use people's love of this genre or this IP and make a boatload of cash?"

Thank you for this reply too - also very thorough and helpful. ‚ÄòDidn‚Äôt know shit but had fun‚Äô is essentially what I (and many others I assume) and hoping to recreate with Vanilla üòÜ - so I am encouraged that you have fond memories of levelling a pally! And the idea of potentially being able to slot into more random dungeon groups is also a big plus. Food for thought... 
---
People will get bored of dungeons and raids eventually but that's also true for Retail. 
---
Leveling on the other hand is pretty much the best part of Vanilla mainly because you have to work for each level and even blue items are huge upgrades plus green items feel good to acquire as well. The world is dangerous too (that second pull can easily screw you lol), you are not babied at all like in Retail.
---
I know this gets parroted a lot, but if you spend ~30 minutes on the AH on a weekly basis you can turn a profit. Your mileage may vary depending on server population and knowledge of the economy... but it beats spending hundreds of hours leveling and gearing a character and then spending countless more hours grinding.
---
$8/hr in Orange County lol. 
---
Whether or not you think Chinese outsourced Diablo Mobile is a good thing (it's not)
---
the fact that ActiBlizzard thought unveiling it during Blizzcon the way they did would result in *anything* other than massive disappointment and outcry goes to show just how incredible disconnected management is with the players.
---
You're wrong mate. A lock in end game gear is a god. A good lock will always out sustain a good mage.

Which one of them is better than the capitalistic games?

The worst part of this corporate change is that the financial restrictions can cause obvious poorer quality customer service, and gameplay and graphics. All to save a few pennies here and there. For the suits who don't play and/or don't care, it won't matter at all. The money is all they care about. The quality can tank for all they care. They will migrate to a new corporation even if they caused the decline or collapse of their previous firm. They are like locusts only concerned about their stomachs and overeating the food system till collapse.

My bad dude read that as the people getting fired have next to no impact.

Blizzard: Let's see boys. Run it through data analytics algorithms.
---
According to data purchased from Facebook clickbait polling company #4051 a single moon brings people comfort while a second moon produces a sense of uneasiness and conjures up anti-Biblical imagery which results in a projected 0.05% chance of a player unsubscribing.
---
On top of that the cost of introducing the second moon would be 1 day's worth of work for a developer which translates to 15 players unsubscribing for one month except part of the developer cost can be written off in our tax department so overall:
---
NOPE. TWO MOONS COSTS TWICE THE MOON BUDGET.
---
$50 CASH SHOP MOON ONLY.
---
So much this.

How about the smoldering coal for the warlock chest piece. Good luck farming that shit while on a pvp server while the other faction is farming elemental fire. 
---
Thankfully Activision has fucked itself so now that there is a real possibility it will not exist in a year or two.
---
Hey this guy was my arch nemesis back in TBC mainly in the throne of elements. We were both mages and went to great lengths to kill each other in whatever way possible. Dismounting, slow fall, pom+pyro + fireblast. If you got some lucky crits you could kill them in one go. The dude was relentless in his world pvp, he always seemed to be online and would always hunt you down and try and ruin your day. While back then I saw it as an annoyance, I now look back at it as one of the more engaging parts of old school wow. 
---
Same here... lets hope for the best
---
You have no idea what you are talking about
---
Private servers are considerably over tuned on the mangos core.
---
Druids are probably at their peak tanking strength in MC  so if anything druids start off stronger and get a little worse at tanking AQ40/Naxx.
---
Seriously why do people like you take the time to type out a few paragraphs when you aren't knowledgeable at all on the subject?
---
And no druid tanks aren't an exception almost all guilds utilize one in the 3rd-5th OT spot. 
---
The tier bonuses from BWL gear are also very good.  So, even if the individual piece of gear from AQ40 might be better, it wasn't worth sacrificing the set bonus. 
---
This is quite a depressing take.  Also, I don't believe its likely what we are looking at, at least at the beginning, assuming the project does reasonably well. By our standards, not Activision's!
---
To start, let me clarify that I'm as disgusted by their actions yesterday as most of us are.  Their greed at the top level is definitely mystifying.  That said, I pretty firmly believe that WoW Classic remains untouched from their plans that were rolled out at Blizzcon.  
---
To give some background, I'm a senior manager in HR for a large technology company in the US.  I can speak with a fairly solid education on the industry, and a very solid practice on how companies conduct RIFs, "aka" reduction-in-force.  
---
It is not only highly likely, but almost a certainty, that their decision to conduct a large scale RIF was made before last Blizzcon.  These things don't just swing out of nowhere, unless you find yourself in a financially critical or bankrupt position, which they clearly are not in.  This is especially the case for a layoff approaching close to 10% of their workforce in the US.  If it were to impact the plans of WoW Classic, that would have been taken into account, and things said at Blizzcon would have to have been left out.  J Allen and (probably) Ion were well aware of the upcoming layoffs, and unless they both intend to utterly destroy the WoW Classic project (can we at least afford them the benefit of the doubt this isn't the case?), they wouldn't have said anything they have to walk back big-time later.  
---
Sharding, at worst, will be left to the starting zones, if at all.  AQ gate opening is up for grabs since they didn't say anything about that (and they sure as hell better not do it).  
---
Cash shop will not be in Classic at launch, and I'm 100% sure.  Again, if the project falters or doesn't generate a reasonable ROI, sure, down the line I can see them screwing the pooch on that one and implementing a cash shop.  But it has **zero** to do with the recent RIF news, and everything to do with the stockholders, and leaderships inability to quell their desires for short term gains instead of a healthy long term vision.  Also, keep in mind we are part of a very specific and vocal community that would flip out over microtransactions - moreso than any other close knit community.  If they don't know that by now...sheesh.
---
Right click reporting will be in game, as they said.  I don't like it either, but its a sacrifice I'm willing to deal with.  And again, it was already communicated to us as such...probably because they knew that support staff would be part of the upcoming RIF.
---
Loot trading - I feel they will buckle on this one.  After all, the vanilla option of "too bad so sad" means less coding for Blizz, and no CM/GM support - double win for them!  We'll see what happens.
---
Anyways, nothing personal, but I feel your overall message is rife with emotion and not much fact.  Yes, there's a certain amount of guessing that goes into all of this (including by me), but I'd urge you to take a step back and look at some of this shit logically for a few minutes.

When The Joker runs a WoW guild
---
Wasn't SL still dispellable in 1.12? I remember putting trash buffs on the lock and VW (like unending breath) was standard, but I don't recall if it was that way all the way to 1.12.
---
It's all a matter of personal preference so none of us can predict what you would enjoy more but imo warlock is more niche, meaning I think it's more likely you roll warlock and wish you had rolled a mage than you rolling a mage and wishing you had rolled a warlock instead.
---
If the top private server guilds and players decide it's dead, it's dead. People have been waiting for this for a decade so for the top players to actually give up on the dream, blizzard really screwed up. 
---
I am going back and forth on playing hunter or resto shaman. I want to raid and I think I would end up enjoying resto and totem twisting more in a raid setting. I think that playing a hunter in raid would be fun too, just the idea of making my melee into dps gods is cool. However, I also want to do world pvp and solo farming. I know I can solo lashers as a shaman, but hunters are obviously better. I need to read the life at 60 thread, but any advice on what I could do outside of raiding as a resto shaman would be great.
---
As I have said in the past one of the best parts about playing horde. Was learning hate. You start out all casual and happy. You see your first ally and you wave and think this game is so fun. Then a minute later two allies... then three allies then an entire party of allies is now there. Only they aren't waving they are hunting you for sport like an animal. You learn to hate then. You learn to pvp then. 
---
By the time you hit sixty. You weren't so much a max level toon. As you were a survivor of some insane Darwinian experiment. All sign of mercy and pity drained from the eyes. The only thing left a simmering rage and a hatred of the knife ears so deep. It worries your normie friends lol
---
That's where I went back to after trying BfA.  Happily playing on a BC server again.
---
Retail is still a fantastic game.
---
People tend to band-wagon that Classic WoW is better in every way - it just isn't.
---
The current raid tier is amazing - levelling this expansion was fun - and getting into the content is fairly easy with some effort. 
---
The way I see it - They remained friends throughout every World of Warcraft expansion - if they were to reverse time and join a Classic Private Server they may not be friends to this day.
---
Believe it or not - Classic WoW isn't a remedy to every problem.
---
Milking a few transaction happy customers a la Retail WoW is more profitable than having hardcore players enjoying a genuinely good game.
---
Tips Out made a good point about how we - or hardcore gamers in general - are the worst type of gaming customer you could ask for.
---
They play a lot (more server resources used), they demand quality, they don't buy too many superfluous things.
---
The casual customers maybe plays once or twice a week, doesn't grind loot chests but instead buys a few for quick fun, doesn't go on forums or expect huge quality from the game - etc.
---
The latter is the type of customer large gaming corporations like Activision Blizzard are aiming for.
---
Fantastic is so very generous 
---
&gt;My opinion is, retail gamers playing a game where no skill is needed
---
You sure about that? Current M+ and raids are like 40 times more involved than OG. The amount of communication and coordination among good players today is crazy.

Don‚Äôt forget about Bodies by Drowning Pool. That was in 80% of the PvP videos I remember watching when I first started the game
---
I don‚Äôt think you should spend too much time thinking about Classic. 
---
I was 15 or 16 when I got it, about a year after it launched. I remember I got it because I had a target giftcard and decided to finally give it a shot. After I got home I called my friend and told him I got it and he rushed over. We created a character and started playing a bit. Even though we only played for a few levels he instantly went to the store and bought it for himself. Within a week I had like 4 friends who had gone out and bought it. We played every available moment. This to the point where if someone was gone from school we knew we would come home to find him a level up on us or with some new gear. We would have to fake being sick in hopes to catch up.

I'll allow it. New official headcanon.

I think the current focus is more on expanding the market to previous non-consumers. The video game industry is growing rapidly and it makes next to no sense developing a game for a niche crowd that remains relatively the same year after year when you could develop a game to a large portion of the people. I think that's why we see so many games of a very similar genre (battle royal) published so rapidly is because they are guaranteed to get a chunk of market share even with a very shallow, low-cost game. More companies are not making games designed for the gamer but instead for the person who plays a couple of games a week but still paid full price for the game just to place/socialize with their friends.
---
It is currently between $10-18. I believe that pay grade is older. Still not great but just saying that their current pay rate is better. 
---
Sharding will still be restricted to your server - you'll still play with people on your specific server, it isn't CRZ.
---
The likely-hood of her playing during the launch of Vanilla is incredibly unlikely - So she was most likely able to move 5 steps without lagging out.
---
Face the fact that Classic WoW will most likely have current server power (10k+ players), meaning there'll be many more people to play with.
---
It is possible to balance each spec to be raid viable while also not being too homogeneous. Tbc did it best. 
---
Will I lose out on a lot of I went Human instead of Gnome Mage? 
---
I like to give might to priests.
---
This is so going to work.. :) 
---
Better than nothing
---
The latter is the type of customer almost all companies are aiming for.
---
Something to keep in mind while deciding your class; the Vanilla PvP trinkets did not break "all cc" like they did in TBC and beyond. Someone brought this up in another comment chain but I figured I would make it a top level comment for visibility since it applies to everyone choosing a class.
---
&gt; Here is a list of which classes can break which CCs with their trinket:
---
* 
---
* **Warrior** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18854
---
* Immobilize
---
* Slow
---
* Stun
---
* **Hunter** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18856
---
* **Rogue** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18857
---
* Charm
---
* Fear
---
* Polymorph
---
* **Warlock** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18858
---
* **Mage** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18859
---
* **Priest** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18862
---
* **Druid** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18863
---
* **Paladin** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18864
---
*
---
* **Shaman** : https://classicdb.ch/?item=18845
---
My biggest complaint by far. If you want to PvE and PvP you are farming constantly to pay for respecs. Cutting reapec cap down in half to 25 would have been way more appropriate imo. 50 is a ton of gold in vanilla. 
---
Ridiculously long resplendent timers on quest items. I‚Äôm looking at your Bingles.
---
Oh I hear you, all good 
---
I mean... it does though. It's just a job, they dont Owe anyone their jobs. It'd be great if they never had to lay anyone off but again, Capitalism isn't an evil economic construct that this guy should be railing against. He lost his job, his Entry level low wage job, Sorry bud, instead of burning his bridges he could use his work experience to find something with better pay leveraging his experience working for Blizz
---
The power gain on naxx gear for me. BWL was fine and the AQ stuff packed some umph but was specialist. Naxx though? that stuff eclipsed everything and made players gods. The raid difficulty was fine but Imo, the gear was way to much of a jump in power.
---
Each to their own.
---
I find the cinematography and Story telling philosophy really enjoyable. 
---
Combat feels very smooth - and the art team do a phenomenal job, as always.
---
It has its downsides - such as Legion did. 
---
Which is providing too much of a grind at end-game to be worth levelling alts. 
---
I understand the hate towards Acti-blizzard - but the game itself is in excellent condition. 
---
Too bad it has become popular opinion to hate on the game. 
---
If Blizz takes a nose dive, then the shareholders will be directly impacted. It's just not as profitable to cater to niche gamers anymore  and making games isn't free.
---
I think there's an interesting notion to where the main gearing content is not the premier gameplay content. Classic raiding is a little grindy and not extremely difficult for any one player - you have some slack with being amongst 39 others.
---
Where your skill will shine is, instead, in attunements, getting key items from dungeons, fighting over important resources out in the world with the other faction. To me, this balance is not too bad if no players are being left out of the raiding content. 
---
I'm not saying this is exactly how vanilla feels, I didn't raid until BC. But the dispersal of skilled content and valuable content is interesting, provided that raids aren't such a burden with their significance. 
---
What I always thought was the big gestalt of 40 man raids is the coordination, the guild pride, having the logistical backbone with consumables. 
---
You haven't had actual contact to a GM in WoW for at least 8 years now.
---
"up to par" buzzword alert. Go play retail if you want homogenized classes. 
---
To be fair, Vanilla had addons that automatically target other raid members for healing and decursing.
---
Cause fuck the other ~800 people?
---
Many more deaths. You will die. 
---
He wasn't part of Blizzard for about a decade before anything went down there.
---
I honestly can't remember, last time I had this discussion had a few guys claiming it wasnt past 1.09 
---
No not that. I don‚Äôt know the other 800, I couldn‚Äôt tell you anyone else without googling. It‚Äôs easier to ask a company to rehire 1 person than rehire 800.
---
See my other comment in this thread about this. While it sucks he got laid off... so what? He complains about capitalism and that a company's sole purpose was to gain profit. Well sorry to break the news to you but yeah, that's the whole point. Companies don't owe people jobs, this isn't socialism where you are given jobs and benefits just for existing. Capitalism isn't evil. It's a merit baded system where you are rewarded for hard work and good ideas. This guy started out with having my attention and ended with my scorn becsuse he made the mistake of putting the blame on anyone but himself. While of course it's out of his control, he seems to demand things and have a sense of entitlement that is VERY off putting. You aren't owed anything, I hope he learns that lesson.
---
You're 100% right. Someone who worked for a tech firm said that the clients that bought their product, paid the subscription, used the product, asked for support, asked for features, etc - they were the worst customers.
---
The clients that bought the product, barely used it, barely cared, but paid the subscription - those were the golden customers.
---
I agree with you that the current raid is amazing, m+ is really fun and keeps 5 mans fun which gives me something to do when I log in and see 2-4 friends online.
---
However, the amount of chores in the game and the nature of those chores is absolutely horrible.
---
Always done this relatively easily.  
---
I abandoned, though, [Fiery Blaze Enchantments](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Fiery_Blaze_Enchantments) in the Badlands, after killing enough dragons/whelps to gain three levels, and not getting the drop.
---
That's why I specified top end. Basically it was Vashj and most of sunwell that necessitated it before they nerfed the crap out of everything.
---
Why not? Belf has a good stealth animation. 
---
I also think it's a very far leap to assume that the layoffs will ensure LFD and a cash shop... but I've said "no chance they would..." so many times and proved wrong over the years that I can't say that here.
---
Ever since they announced Classic WoW - I was on the forums debating for the change to the Old PvP system.
---
It is borderline unethical. 
---
A modern Hardcore/mythic raider will crush Classic Raids. 
---
Especially if they get addons as support.
---
Would it be better if they played a male elf?
---
Obviously i feel bad for the guy, and all the others who lost their jobs, but as for that last paragraph...
---
  If you are trying to support a family on an 8-9$/hr job in the middle of the highest cost of living area of the US... well, honestly they have done you a favor, you need bigger goals and expectations when it comes to employment than just "i want to work for them for perks"
---
There are so many differences between them that they're like 2 different games.  This is the reason people want Classic Wow - because they liked the Classic version of the game.  
---
**The Game**
---
WoW Live is largely about funneling people to end-game.  The last continent is designed with a lot of repeatable content, and a lot of dev focus is on the dungeon and raid experience.  You level fast and get geared fast so you can quickly get into raids and Mythic+.  The game swings widely from really easy (most content) to really hard (Mythic raids and Mythic+ dungeons).
---
WoW Classic was largely about the WORLD of Warcraft.  Exploration and the leveling experience was a big part of the game.  You weren't a hero of the Alliance or Horde.  You were just an adventurer that was in way over your head.  The game is constantly punishing and requires you to think.
---
**Will They Update Classic?**
---
There is a planned staggered content release, where we start off with the lower tiers and over time the higher tiers are unlocked.  We don't know what will happen.  Overall, most people who want Classic want no changes to the game, to truly preserve its classic status.  There are three main groups I've seen regarding new content after a few years:
---
1. No new content, keep Classic preserved
---
2. (My personal option) upgrade some servers to TBC, and some of those later to WotLK.  
---
3. Go the Runescape model and start over with new content
---
Personally, while I want TBC and WotLK, we don't even know if Classic will succeed, or if it will be ruined by Activision.  Let's not put the cart ahead of the horse.
---
**When is it coming out?**
---
Soon.
---
Yeah but *everyone else*
---
I have an SL lock on pserver and I put up the trash buffs every time, but that's just a good thing to do in pvp in general to protect you from dispells. I don't recall ever having SL dispelled but then again, trash buffs.
---
Sounds like retail is for you.
---
*Laughs in Sida's Bag*
---
Alliance tend to be less PvP oriented than Horde and one of the easiest things to do in WSG for a noob is just camp the spawn room. On my server (Bronzebeard US) Horde queues were very long compared to Alliance so the people queuing on Horde were pretty dedicated to killing Allies while the Alliance anyone could queue up and just 'meh' around.
---
I'm 28 years old now. So i won't be able to sink too much time into Classic, the plan is to lvl to 60 and do some dungeons and pvp/world pvp nothing too serious. The thing i'm most excited for is the community. 
---
"\*name\* is ganking at Nesingwary's again.."  Is a phrase i havent seen in a long time, and i miss it.   
---
Capitalism is pretty evil though 4real its a very anti-human. When profit is the single purpose humanity suffers.
---
I would've been 10 years old - and My toon would be around level 20 ish at that very date. 
---
He's blowing 3 min CDs every time he gets a kill though :/
---
The people complaining about non viable specs are the same people who ruined the game. They will quit before they ever get past vael. 
---
Combat is the worst part of retail
---
This seems like one of the only real objective concerns, is how the gear disparity will play out with the raid cycle. It made sense to have such powerful gear when we all knew an expansion was imminent, but if we're staying at 60 then it's worth considering how powerful the final raid's gear should be.
---
You're not only wrong you're laboring under Dunning-Kruger syndrome.
---
Mages have the highest dps parsing in Naxx.
---

This is just a pissy hit piece written by some loser they laid off. 
---
Warriors will be imo 
---
Ty for info.
---
I get what your saying, but whats to stop anyone from needing on every single drop in a blizzlike system so they can sell or DE?
---
Blasted Lands anyone?
---
If you want to by his friend then follow him on Twitter or something.  I don't know what they teach in public schools these days but multi-billion dollar corporations aren't democracies.
---
after playing BFA and Classic WoW, I can definitely say ‚Äúin my opinion‚Äù that Classic is way more fun in just about every way. lol. 
---
I was pointing out the absurdity of you using Venezuela as your go-to non-capitalist country. Not especially interested in having a conversation beyond that since you apparently don't want to accept that something can have created good things but also be flawed at the same time.
---
Yep - That's what vanilla is all about. 
---
The upside is you'll have many people to call on when you are getting grief'd. 
---
I'm sorry to hear that
---
All their gear is virtualized, they dont need to upgrade servers, just deploy larger VMs. Its costs alot less in almost every way.
---
You can also look at how many 'hardcore' gamers are added to the pool every year. I'd reckon very few compared to those that 'join just because everyone else is playing.' 
---
100%. If they take our classic loyalty and take advantage of that, nothing would give me more joy than all of us as a community going to a PServer, and showing Activision Blizzard we won‚Äôt take their shit anymore. I would happily pay a sub to a Pserver with a large community.
---
&gt; Wouldn't you feel that the diploma requirement is bullshit?
---
Not when the reality is that very few people actually go through the trouble of buying the diploma.
---
You need to remember, wow right now (to keep your analogy) is 5% of people who have a diploma and maybe 1% have bought their diploma (very high estimate).
---
That means if you're not asking for a diploma you have a 24 in 25 chance of finding people without a diploma while when asking for it you have a 1 in 5 chance of finding someone who didn't earn it.
---
Does this mean more freedom to troll in Classic without being suspended? Every cloud has a silver lining
---
Obviously not you twat.
---
He‚Äôs a community manager, we‚Äôre the community. A lot of us like him so what‚Äôs wrong with trying to get a guy (the only guy to communicate with us about classic, which is why we‚Äôre all on this sub) re-hired? Feedback is the only way to even get a message to a large company like this.
---
How is it anti human if it was ceated by humans to allow transfer of goods,services, labor in exchange for capital. It is a voluntary system that rewards people who contribute with capital. Unless you have some new idea no one has thought of in the last two centuries to ethicly exchange wealth and allow human ingenuity and talent to flourish, please do tell me. Shareholders want more growth and thus you feel they compromised their video game product. Fortunately you have options and are not forced to continue giving them money.
---
I played Vanilla Wow, too.
---
Different games, essentially. 
---
If you had to ask me - I'd say I prefer questing and story telling now way more than I did in Vanilla.
---
I used to love organising dungeon groups over general chat - however, in my mind, you can't compare LFG and Vanilla grouping.
---
Two completely different benefits. 
---
As an example to how they are different games, at least. 
---
Being an altoholic again. I used to love leveling in WoW, having class quests to look forward to, variety in how classes played, and of course the talent point system. I think leveling is what suffered most when WoW became focused entirely on the endgame.
---
Candy Crush is one of the most profitable games of all time. It's not because of epic and intricate game design.
---
 But then you realize you grinded out a 1/4 of a level and will get way more exp than the quest was going to give. Also a world epic dropped.
---
Well, this guy wasn't actually part of this round of layoffs as far as I can tell. He may have an axe to grind, though.
---
That said, you're right that they don't owe anyone jobs. But it's still a really bad look to boast about your record profits but then turn around and lay off 800 workers. It's hard to take a hardship angle on that one, it isn't like the company needed to free up funds if they made record profits. That's why people don't like it, which I think is legitimate.
---
Really the problem comes from the fact that Blizzard was once seen as kind of a flag-bearer for the industry. A company that did things right, and for the love of the games they were making. Seeing them do things that other companies and corporations do isn't surprising in the sense of them being a corporation. It just makes people upset because it's become clear that Blizzard isn't the company it used to be.
---
Now, I'm not one of these people railing on Activision like they are suddenly the problem 11 years after they merged. I'm placing the blame squarely on Blizzard's shoulders.
---
My first three thoughts after reading your reply:
---
1. Oh, god no.  TBC is for me.  Did you not read my post where a lot of the changes past WotLK ruined it worse?
---
2. This wasn't a "change these in Vanilla" post, but the things I don't like about it.
---
3. Do you have any specific feedback on any of my points, or are you just calling me out to make yourself feel good about being a true Classic fan?
---
If you look at my post, and each of the issues:
---
1. Fixed in TBC
---
2. Fixed in TBC.  Made worse at the end of WotLK with RDF
---
3. Fixed in TBC and WotLK.  Made worse sometime later by removing all of these flavor abilities.
---
4. Largely fixed over time as more and more features are put in to make inventory management easier.  I don't know if there's a point where it got "too easy" but I've never felt like inventory management added to the game.
---
5. I believe this was fixed in Cata, but I could be wrong on that.  One of the few things I think I like better today.
---
6. Fixed in TBC.  Absurdly broken in Mists and the reason I have repeatedly burned out and quit the game ever since.
---
7. Fixed in TBC.  Homogonized to a greater degree and ruined more every expansion.
---
8. Fixed in TBC.  Homogonized to a greater degree and ruined more every expansion.
---
9. Never really had a good solution, except that you level so fast you don't need the breadcrumbs anymore.  There has been a push to get rid of breadcrumbs and instead do call-outs (or whatever they're called), so maybe the mechanic has just gone away completely.  I don't mind breadcrumbs, I just mind how inconsistent they are in terms of whether or not they're needed.  This is also a minor detail.
---
10. I prefer spell ranks (Vanilla and TBC) to not having them(Cata and on).  This issue got worse in WotLK because the mana cost would rise per level but the power wouldn't.  There might be some ways to fine-tune this system to make it still function the way it does (by allowing downranking and getting that nice power boost when you rank up) but without feeling useless right before a skill up.
---
6 of my issues were made better in TBC, and made worse before or by Mists of Pandaria.  Two of my issues were fixed in Cata or later.  One never had a good solution, and one is more about tweaking the system in Vanilla instead of using the system in live.
---
What on earth makes you think retail is better, based on this?
---
Horde won every bg that wasn't rigged. When you are outnumbered 5-1 on most servers you put a higher premium on learning to pvp. The BG system exposed a lot of alliance by forcing them to fight under even odds lol. Must have been weird being an ally who's good at pvp. 
---
Aye, only 51 points in vanilla, he probably just misspoke and meant 30/0/21 since he replied to the comment and said exact same? not sure tho, im not the op
---
It's a mage oneshotting someone every 3min.
---
Seems fine to me. 
---
Balance druid has been very boring for the past 3 years - So i switched off to Paladin/Warlock.
---
Warlock is by far the more enjoyable combat over the two.
---
People tend to exaggerate.
---
Every day on forums there is a new "This is the worst part of WoW!" comment. 
---
It gets old after the 100th time it is mentioned.
---
For example: I find rogue insipidly boring - while some considered it the most enjoyable class to play. 
---
I always play nelf priest on pvp server.  You want fearward in raids, bring pots.  I'm shadowmelding in BGs and staying out of trouble in the world..because I am playing for my enjoyment not your raid needs.
---
&gt; It's a merit based system where you are rewarded for hard work and good ideas.
---
Well, it's hard to argue that point right now when the people who put in hard work and helped contribute to the company's record profits were let go just to increase those profits.
---
The author doesn't seem to be part of this round of layoffs by my reading of the article, btw.
---
Says the dude who has probably never gotten laid off.

My pleasure! I know you mentioned friends playing too, if you can play in a group it makes the class SO much more dynamic. Imagine yourself trying to keep track of your 2 buddies in a fight, oh, that one is frozen, dispel him! Oh, the other one is rooted, he needs a blessing of freedom! Oh damn now im getting opened on by a rogue, bubble out of it and keep desperately healing friend #1 since hes going down! better reposition myself behind this tree over here so that mage trying to cast on me gets a Line of Sight error!
---
Super fun when you are playing with friends! So hopefully i didnt sound too negative haha
---
Non-viable specs isn‚Äôt a con, AQ40/Naxx40 won‚Äôt be cleared by most. The PvP system is definitely flawed, however. 
---
How is it even legal to be public and own your stock? You can just artificially inflate your value by refusing to sell.
---
They are gay as fuck, just ignore the complete race. Female Elfs are only playable if you mod them to be look less like a fucking Barby-Doll.
---
I spent almost all of Lvl 32 grinding in Desolace to get the Flayed Demon Skin, had a single bar left. The longer it took for it to drop the more determined I was to get it, it was like it was provoking me.
---
My warlock died for me afterI lost my legendaries. It isn't that its bad, it's just that I know it can and was better before.
---
It's hard for me to sympathize with any of this for some reason. Am I a bad person? Blizzard worked a trillion times better when it was one tenth of the size, unlike now where it seems like an entitled, bloated, bureaucratic mess.
---
On my server though I think it was about even in terms of balance. It also was a PvE server though...
---
Detect magic is used alllllllll the time by good mages to cover their sheep. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about lol. 
---
Agreed.
---
I despise having to hit 120 and level essentially another artifact weapon. 
---
Back in MoP and WoD - you could just start gearing for PvP or PvE once you hit cap - no need to catch up on some vital 'must-have' grind, such as the heart of Azeroth.
---
Makes you feel like the "levelling" process doesn't stop after hitting 120. 
---
You are just perpetually levelling - never truly hitting 120 and gearing up. 
---
Pendant from the crocolisks outside org smh
---
I think topics like this will be really good down the road when classic vanilla wow is out to, because we will want to be looking both at whats good and bad.
---
However my opinion about old vanilla WoW's flaws would be this.
---
1.) Confused balance direction: They had really good ideas of making all builds diverse, and racials diverse. As the guy talked about with paladins not having taunt, and trying to solve the flaws with different solutions. Being the only melee without direct strikes. This was a really good idea, and then the development started slowly steering instead more to homogenizing. I think that blizzard should have just been tough, power through the naysayers on how "unfair" only pallies exist on alliance and shammy on horde, and keep diversifying to balance rather then simplify.
---
2.) Lack of arena: I like everysingle aspect of the PvP grind, Battlegrounds, and World PvP. That incredible endless grind to rank 14 is just always something out there that is out of reach to others. Quality's like that is enjoyable because not everyone has to do "everything". I have no other complaint about PvP except I think that in TBC arena was one of the best changes to pvp but took away a lot of the Wpvp and world.
---
3.) End Game Gold Spending: There was a lot of really good ways to spend gold. Epic mounts, Consumeables, Crafting, AH % cut, repair bills. However out of all ways of spending gold there where all two methods that actually had consistant re-spendings. Consumeables and repair bills. The actual amount you could speld vs how much gold a server can accumulate was a uneven balance. I think that there could be new content developed in ways of making more fun uses for gold to help keep a server from inflating over time.
---
4.) Gear diversity: I think that in Vanilla WoW, you had the most options of gear then at any other point of WoW. There was a lot of different mix and matches of baseline stats. When you go to TBC this was simplified a bit to things like say "Spell hit, Spell penetration, Spell Crit" "Spell damage, Healing". I feel that gear diversity should have been expanded on rather then simplified. This would open up future development of new lands, new dungeons, just new things in general because now you have more gear to fill it without raising the levels.
---
Those are four things that come off the top of my head
---
How many times must it be explaines that no changes refers to any thing that happened within the history of vanilla wow.
---
I did it a couple years ago with a not-overleveled warrior and was able to do it solo. If you just go slow but steady enough with a few potions and consumables with decent gear, some cooldowns, and playing intelligently, you can do it solo, even with a crappy low level class. Felt pretty satisfying.
---
Nice, yeah that would be a cool one then. Orc Warlock sounds like a way to keep it fresh and kind of mix the 2 youve done so far since you liked both. Like the pet control/utility of a hunter, with the ranged magic dps of the mage == warlock haha. I think that would be cool.
---
Locks are also the best scaling class in the super long term game if you plan on raiding the whole way through naxx as well. Mages are good the whole way and get big numbers through aoe and proper use of cooldowns. Locks are more middle of the pack at first and get better with gear. Mages do spike for a bit during AQ but mostly because of ignite ticks by going Fire spec, and only 1 mage gets that honor iirc (whoever has the most +dmg equipped)
---
This dumb as hell
---
C&amp;C and Red Alert are still up there as my all time favourites - I remember playing over Kali with my brother doing all nighters in team FFA matches.  Sending an army of attack dogs vs infantry was the best :) till the tanks ran em over...
---
Good point. That drives the value of Orcs WAY up for sure.
---
I disagree on racials, having them + faction specific classes really give the factions and characters a unique feel.as long as there isn't one clear cut race that is the best at everything. I like being forced to make difficult decisions on race and class combos. I spend a ton of time just daydreaming over what O will play when classic comes out, and that would never be a thing if racials were removed.
---
I only ever play private now
---
Like they care. They are doing it to cut costs - classic is not going to have community managers. It all makes sense now wow - right click reported!
---
Does it matter ?
---
Yeah, Warlock Post Legion was a weird change. 
---
I don't personally agree with a lot of tampering - make the legendaries a part of the core class.
---
I know for a fact that dreamweaver on my Druid made it 100x better to play prior to the nerf. 
---
The shitty thing was that the nerf stunted the specialisation.
---
Was doing top damage by a large margin, then post-nerf was doing mid-tier to bottom damage. Not because other classes were doing more damage, purely just because of the nerf. 
---
Feelsbadman.
---
I'm 30 years old. I have been laid off 4 times so far in my life and I expect it to happen many more times. Philly is not any where near as well off as Cali so I can also guarantee they will have an easier time finding a new job. They are also more skilled then me. So they should have not trouble finding a new job. Me? I had to move away from my entire family to Texas to try to find work. Take your whiney tears some where else. Grown ups understand you don't work for your parents. If you aren't felt to be producing value you will be cut.
---
You are very lucky that your friends still play. All mine from back in the day, except for one,  has quitted.
---
You‚Äôre delusional dude. Literally getting triggered by a change.org link. You don‚Äôt like it? Move on.
---
Oh, so that's the thing, you're one of those dress-up babies that pick their race based on looks.
---
I recommend vQueue. It includes an option to not display lfg/lfm posts in your chat window, minimizing spam. 
---
Not being able to see flaws in something you love is literally insane.
---
&gt;Do we need multi-billion dollar corporations though?
---
Way too deep for me.  I don't do philosophy.  Lol
---
&gt;Good games come from small but passionate groups of developers.
---
Good games also come from large corporations.  I love the Borderlands franchise, Bethesda has done well with just about everything they touch.  Bioshock Infinite won game of the year.  I don't see your point.
---
&gt;When was it that anything really good came from a multi-billion dollar corporation?
---
See examples above.
---
&gt;Game dev companies need to stay small, and make games with passion and love for their product. When something begins to be driven by greed, it becomes empty and hollow inside.
---
Your outlook is naive and is really a perspective I'd expect from a child.  I'm not trying to talk down to you but business are designed to make money.  Tell me about all those good games that no one wants to buy.  You have this real pure, cute, floating on a cloud idea of how games are developed by which is just untrue.  You should read John Staats diary for some insight.  Spoilers: I can tell you right now they couldn't get enough people and grow fast enough to get WoW the way they wanted.
---
Of course. What other reason is there to pick a Race? 
---
You don‚Äôt like it? Move on
---
And the thing is, when classic gets released, we're still going to support Activision with our monthly sub fees
---
It's true, the main difference is that people are bored of the dungeons the second they step foot in them in retail these days
---
Racials?
---
Never go male in a video game. 
---
So basically a useless ability to waste a debuff slot, and not actually used for anything.
---
You could give them another magic ability that actually has use in order to make it worth it.
---
Orc is the master race of Vanilla WoW. If you can go Orc, you go Orc. 
---
Yup
---
Horde have better individual pvp racials for sure, but I think that is balanced bt alliance have stronger pve racials on top of pallies being superior buff wise and in premade pvp. Oh and fear ward
---
I‚Äôm gonna play classic but I would sell everything for transmog options :/ I‚Äôm too used to not looking like a bowl of fruity pebbles now. 
---
Itemization is ok for druids at least, u just have to have a few sets.  
---
1 set for kitty
---
1 set for bear
---
1 set with int for decursing
---
1 set for healing if needed
---
You can basicly do every role in any raid with the same spec. Yes u pay the hybrid tax but you offer so much flexibility. It just takes a ton of dedication
---
Achievements aren't a requirement to play the game.  So if other people are achieving, that doesn't/shouldn't affect your gameplay.  You are the player that creates your "player-defined" parameters.  How is what you are doing trivialized by what others are doing?
---
Likewise when people say LFR DESTROYED THE GAME!!!  People that wanted to just hardcore raid, were still just hardcore raiding.  How others raid has no affect on how I raid.  I don't define what I have by what others have or do.  I play the game for fun for me and find like-minded friends to share in the experience.
---
Flaws to you is not flaws to me. What if I love the flaws too? 
---
Oh poor Kid, I pity you. You will learn to play Games to have fun when you get older.
---
I loved the pvp system, but the rank 14 grind was plain unhealthy and I think should be changed.
---
1. Too broad of a question - there are many main differences.
---
2. No Arenas. During 1.12 there was Cross-realm BGs.
---
3. No update on that as of yet - I personally believe it is up to how many people Classic WoW can retain after a few months.
---
4. During 2019 - They have all the information - it is just about consolidating it and Moving it to a Legion vessel.
---
5. Forums, youtube, twitch, and Q&amp;A.
---
6. I'd assuming it isn't particularly difficult to bring back - more time consuming, as is fitting with anything Vanilla. The biggest issue is bringing to client over to 7.2.5 ( or around there) for Battle net and customer support reasons. And possibly in-game store (assuming pets)
---
Thanks for your honesty
---
Most of his taxes are capital gains and not income. But yeah, he is still probably well above 12% effective tax rate.
---
In terms of PvP I mean im a bit of a carebear, hardly ever going out of my way to engage people, even if its unfair and I'd win. I have enjoyed killing people on retail though as ganker on my feral druid so I may come to enjoy it more. 
---
As for racials, I really don't like human hair/beard options, they look mostly awful to me and I'm not a huge fan of their animations, I much prefer dwarves. 
---
What, no mention of Helcular's Rod yet? (Granted, the Flayed Demon Skin and Captain Sander's Map also are great contenders; I think I got them to drop *once* during actual Classic)
---
Or that stupid "Strange Ore" quest from the smith at Camp Taurajo: About five mobs strewn across the entirety of Thousand Needles, with a drop chance of less than 20%.
---
Can't wait to rage again.
---
Hey not true. Sometimes I'd have to use blizzard for trash packs.
---
If its not lupos pre-nerf your tank has to be fucking up hard to lose aggro to a pet, at least in lvl 60 content. 
---
He's a former community manager, and for good reason; primarily because he's not a developer.  He got a severance package, got to keep his benefits and you have to move on.  Your irrational lashing out because you can't discern the difference between conducting business and personal attacks is childish.
---
Akiris reeds in STV, Sida's bag in Wetlands, and literally every quest in The Shimmering Flats make Noggenfogger's quest look like a fool's errand.
---
I am playing games to have fun and do you know what I learned from playing a race that looked fucking horrible for 3 years? Looks don't make the game less fun.
---
I was nodding along until the last sentence, and then I sighed, because that hasn't happened to me since '07.
---
The developers are passionate about the game - it is no surprise you blame the developers over the company. 
---
There won't be any good MMOrpgs in the future. 
---
It is certainly a genre that isn't very popular. 
---
Would you've done is just jumped into a rabbit hole of slippery slope thinking, paranoia and unnecessary worrying.
---
What will happen is what will happen.
---
If that has a severe emotional impact on you personally, then you probably shouldn't be playing Classic WoW. 
---
Ouch. lol
---
Unless people like leveling alts.  Which as it stands...a lot of people do.  They don't do it JUST for farming/alt-professions.
---
You understand you‚Äôre not making sense right? Obviously they aren‚Äôt saying ‚Äúfuck Ythisens lets fire him‚Äù it‚Äôs a huge layoff. Me, as a consumer and member of the community, think he did a great job and that his removal was an oversight by Blizzard.
---
It's a design feature, it's a minigame within the game to see if you can jump it.
---
I played a priest on nostalrius and am considering rolling a priest again, but there are a few problems I couldn't solve and I'm wondering if anyone has some insight.  
---
1. In pvp healing, with full r10 and bis off pieces, warriors and rogues could basically instant kill me, and warlocks/mages kept me infinitely cc'd. Besides living on a pillar with people to peel for me, is there any way to deal with these issues?
---
2. In raids I found it impossible to use Mana efficient heals and do well on meters. I ended up using many ranks of flash heal to top meters because I could get my heals off before other people. (Our healing team was so good that we just went FFA on healing.) Is it possible that with a different raid comp, I would be able to heal more strategically?
---
3. Are any healers able to stay alive when getting attacked by warriors or rogues?
---
&gt; ou can tank 4 horseman as Druid.
---
Sure, if you want to increase your wipe odds by a lot.
---
Pretty sure people leave one gray/white item in chests to troll others.  It's not nice, certainly a dick move, but I'm fairly certain that's why you come across the cheese chests.
---
The writing really is on the wall when you break it down like that :(
---
Shame... I suppose we can still hope for a miracle, and perhaps we can gain some information from the project even if it flops via better metrics for our private server formulas and such. We can see what proc rate they give ironfoe at least LOL
---
Nope, pretty sure he was laid off on purpose.
---
Blizzard achieved their highest revenue in history. Revenue. Not Profit. However, they expect this to drop by 13% within the next year because they are not producing enough games. To this extent they fired 800 non-developer personnel so they can hire more developers to make more games.
---
Unless he's applying to become a developer you're wasting your time.
---
What do you mean?
---
This is so true it hurts.
---
blizzard: we need loottrading in classic because our support staff cant handle all the tickets
---
also blizzard: even though we had a record year we gotta get rid of 800+ support staff
---
I personally thought it was dispellable off of pet until tbc, but they pointed out some vague text in 1.09 patchnotes and said it wasn't. Ive played on a few pservers and some can dispel and others you can't. So I really haven't seen any solid proof either way
---
Did you forget when MC was brought back for the 10 year anniversary or whatever? Teaching raid finder kiddies how to do old content made me want to open my wrists.
---
If it were merit based the people making the decisions should at least also be taking a pay cut.
---
&gt;There is a difference between unappealing artistically and straight up unappealing.
---
No there isn't actually.  Unappealing is a personal preference...I.E. An opinion.  It doesn't matter in what context you find it unappealing, it's still YOUR opinion.  Masterofknees said it best: 
---
 "your...point is very subjective...not saying you should love it, just that it's a very subjective statement."
---
Theory crafting for encounters of that level is done at most in like 2 hrs today. Just look at the test raid encounters. 
---
I think there‚Äôs a fine line that people blur on this topic. 
---
On one hand, dwarf priests make raids a lot easier because of fear ward
---
On the other, players may want to play nelf/human instead of dwarf
---
The middle ground is willing to accept that no everyone will be okay with each other. There are guilds that won‚Äôt be okay with you not being dwarf as priest, and there will be players not okay playing as a dwarf. They have different goals, and thus should be in different groups. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to play a nelf/human priest, that‚Äôs okay, but don‚Äôt get upset when top tier guilds don‚Äôt take you
---
Likewise, if you‚Äôre only going to take dwarf priests to raids/guild, don‚Äôt get upset people play what they want
---
Just be happy with what you prefer and understand it may limit you in some areas and not others
---
I'm interested in every activity, but mainly PvE. Ofc would like to raid. Would be fine T1/T2 and dungeons. I like both hots and dots, I more or less need to know which demands less time.
---
dont need gms if you have right click report that just auto bans you if you have enough reports
---
Why is this an objective flaw? I personally like this a lot, that you can't dual-spec that easily. 
---
With alchemy, you can easily make 100g per day spending 30 minutes buying herbs off the auction house and reselling the potions you craft.
---
Or you could just make friends with a dps and farm together. 
---
But we don't even have phones!
---
*-posted from my android device*
---
Capitalism is flawed. I just think posts like "This is capitalism" imply that they have some great alternative that just nobody has ever tried yet.
---
Obviously he just works over 1000 times harder than us.  
---
He definitely deserves that amount of money for sitting at a desk 5 hours a day then leaving early to beat traffic so he can get 18 holes of golf in.
---
More like two tiers and dungeons, looks like everyone aoe farms now for leveling. 
---
You played on the server Duskwood? Or met in the zone? Curious cause Duskwood was my main server me and my dad played on. Good times!
---
The lack of cutting edge 5-man content at max level. I love raiding, but I can't raid every day, or maybe I can't always commit to a solid schedule, so I enjoy difficult 5 mans. BRD is tough with an underleveled group, and Blackrock Spire and Scholo are legitimately hard, but it's definitely a downside when comparing Classic to Burning Crusade.
---
Whereas in BC, at 70 you have about 15 dungeons to do, that are all harder than *any* 5-man content is in Vanilla. Granted, Wrath and onward, heroics became a joke, and I hate the Mythic+ system on live, so it's not really a Vanilla flaw and more of a BC strength compared to Vanilla, that accentuates a missing element it has.
---
Sometime down the road, If Blizzard ever decides to throw a few devs at Classic, 5-man heroics would be *absolutely* entertaining. Remember how hard SFK was? Imagine doing it with your full level 60 kit, Molten Core gear, and every boss has some new fucked up ability that makes you hate your life. Arugal would be the hardest boss in WoW history. 
---
I'll enjoy Classic for all it's strengths and weaknesses, and I don't want heroic dungeons touching "classic". But if they open the door for an additional adaptation down the road, sign me the fuck up.
---
At this point people like you need to take your own advice. If you hate Blizzard so much move on. Stopping coming here to shit on everyone else's enthusiasm. 
---
Ah your thinking of the one where the guy runs into the room full of whelps screaming? thats Leeroy Jenkins man
---
I dont think anyone says not to play what you like but they have an objection if your choice effects their experience.
---
What the fuck lol, I didn‚Äôt shit on anyone‚Äôs enthusiasm.
---
I‚Äôm just sad Ythisens got laid off, and being laid off sucks.
---
As the article mentions, what this means for Classic seems unclear - perhaps they don't consider it a "release" since it's a re-release of an older game? Still, worrisome.
---
that it wasn't finished, there was plenty of content that was clearly meant to be in the game, but they never got around to it, cat form quest and the eranikus questline comes to mind
---
That's because you're spending time following a game where there is (unsurprisingly) zero information. Go outside, forget about Classic for a while, come back when the beta is launched.
---
LOL he reminded me of that guy too. Definitely one of those "on the spectrum" things /shrug
---
People have to stop assuming companies won't fire people, because they had a 'record year' in terms of revenue. This is such a cheap shot at companies and honestly bullshit made up, for people to easily fling at employers.
---
It's because they tried Classic sub into retail to make the numbers look like the game is growing.  Calling Classic a new title release undermines their marketing agenda.
---
**BUT BUT BUT WE HAVE TODOSOMETHINGGGN**
---
Totally aware of what my nelf priest does and what a dwarf priest does.  I see this rather clearly and not blurred in the least.  My point is if someone gives me a hard time, I let them know I picked this priest for *me* and not for *their* raid needs.  I don't have the ability to be upset that anyone might not choose me for a raid, because I don't do pugs.
---
In my guild, you can play any class/spec you want and we will make it work in raids.  We don't have any server firsts and I couldn't be any less interested.  What we do have is everyone playing exactly what they wanted to play and making it work, because that is the definition of fun for me and how all games should be approached.
---
Dude stop being a ****ing b**ch seriously. Let the guy just offer a petition to sign. This is the best community manager we‚Äôve had in a long time and clearly a lot of people want him back if possible. Worst thing blizzard can do is say no and move on !???
---
Stop being so negative....
---
"Up to par" doesn't have to mean "homogenized". See: TBC
---
Yeah pretty much
---
I agree about priest racials. Not only does it make non-dwarf priests less sought after and makes them feel gimped for their own RPG choice, but it elevates Dwarf priests in the raiding scene, even if they may be worse than a human, for example. 
---
It's comparable to, let's say, only dwarf hunters getting Tranquilizing Shot, and then only giving Night Elves Scorpid Sting. It's just night and day how valued the two spells are. 
---
I will say, I *love* the idea of race specific class spells, I think they should be a thing more often. It gives great flavor, but something *vital* to raiding like Fear Ward isn't just a little flavor. It's like dumping the whole box of salt onto your meal. Instead of enhancing the class/race feel of Priests, it just nullifies the others.
---
Wait, who is ripping on the devs? I'm confused here, could we get some context? 
---
Dream dust in swamps of sorrow beats them all
---
50g respec costs
---
This will be a huge burden on the phone scene 
---
And was clicking their spells :)
---
I agree. I wonder if they could find a way to nerf Fear Ward without pissing off the fanbase. Yeah, yeah, I know that's impossible, but I think most people would be happy with a longer Cooldown on Fear Ward? Dwarves are still desired, and other races are slightly more accepted?
---
There's no fearward pot though
---
Aq40 is considered t2.5. It's not meant to be better than everything that came before. On the other hand, Naxx t3 is supposed to replace everything from bwl, as it should considering the difficulty level and short amount of time it was available.
---
Aq40 offered a lot of much needed gear for off specs. Druid, priest, paladin and shaman get non-healing gear set for the first time. Rogues get a set which helps justify pve dagger spec.
---
Can you elaborate? Sounds interesting lol
---
That‚Äôs just retarded. Bring on the pitchforks, find some poor guy and mass report him. This system is no good...
---
Yup exactly, two different goals for two different groups 
---
For the record I know you‚Äôre on the same page, I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you
---
I've seen this topic rehashed a dozen times.  Bottom line is you don't want people with abrasive cultural differences (which some refuse to acknowledge), completely out of wack timezone management for grouping up/raids, and non native speakers making communication overly challenging just to name a few.
---
Personally, I'm sorry your friend groups may get segregated but it's for the greater good.  I hope you can compromise with some of them and get on the same server.
---
Explore the streets of Stormwind, it can be quite fun.
---
ITT: A lot of subjective opinions and not a single objective fact. 
---
Blizzard cut GM staff because their subs are way down since BFA launched. If Classic doubles or triples their subs then they will add staff. GM/CM are entry-level positions and it is easy to fire and hire as needed.
---
I don't see any reason to believe cash shop or LFD/LFR will make it into Classic given that the project lead (Ion) has been crystal clear in saying these things will never be in Classic. Since Ion wasn't laid off, I don't understand the massive pessimism here.
---
But yes, right-click reporting &amp; loot trading will be in Classic. If that's a dealbreaker for you, then so be it - I don't see those things being big enough to break my favorite game of all time.
---
Same here. I hate the human look and only do it for the min/max side of it to get that extra % damage.
---
I think a Dwarf priest would be right up your alley then since they also look great with the biggest shoulders of the alliance races. They are great in groups and the leveling is a breeze with a good wand and wand spec + spirit tap talents.
---
You are right about the competition on rogues... every raid will have 5+ of each rogues and warriors, all fighting for the same rarely-dropped weapons.
---
Have you ever thought about a gnome warlock? Based on what you said about liking the RP elements and being into PvE, a warlock fits both nicely. They have a lot of cool quests for their different demon pets and they get a free "themed" mount too. That might be a good choice if you arent that into the idea of healing.
---
Good luck man! Let us know if you make a decision!
---
This is an excellent point i've actually never thought of before, in 14 years of WoWing. 
---
It's the version of WoW where every class is the *most* unique, yet it's the version of WoW where there is the most raiders in a group. The two strengths kind of cancel each other out.
---
I think that's why I genuinely have a good time doing UBRS. It's difficult for fresh 60s, you could call it a raid since the bosses are ??, and as a 10 man, every class can still shine. A clutch fear could come in handy, druids can Hibernate, and 1 bres/innervate will turn a wipe into a success, every single class CC is used, shit, you could even take a Paladin tank to UBRS as far as I'm aware. 
---
If you can make 30g/hour on your healer/tank, you'd need to farm for nearly 200 hours at 60g/hour to break even on a mage farming Dire Maul if memory serves. And that's not counting the roughly 170 hours of /played to get another 60.
---
Farming herbs, DM:E jump runs, fishing at the right times, selling your service in dungeon (and gathering off-spec gear while doing so) all net you 20g+. As well as several low-level farms.
---
Hell, priest/palas can both farm DM:E same as a mage can, although less efficiently of course. Druids can do stealth runs with rogues or other druids.
---
Without capitalism we wouldn‚Äôt have Blizz 
---
Imbalance between specs, exacerbated by a lack of gear supporting certain specs. PvP system rewarding time invested rather than skill. Empty, unfinished parts of the world. 40-man raids necessitating easy content. Quest design limited to killing and fetching. Lack of guild bank/repair.
---
Then why does the petition only have 7 signatures?  I'm not stopping anyone from signing and I never even said he should take it down.  You're reading too much into it.
---
Telling someone businesses don't hire poeple based on petitions and offering facts isn't offensive.
---
&gt; how grossly out of touch the average player is with the development process.
---
That relationship can work both ways. A look at the current (and arguably the past 3 other expansions) state of WoW gives some evidence that the current WoW devs are having hard time pleasing their fan base, and I think that's evidence of them being out of touch with the player base (among a few other factors). 
---
&gt; Again it's business, not personal.
---
But, it is personal to the people who lost their jobs and I think that most if not all of us can empathize with that because most if not all of us are in a similar situation to where we could be cut at any second, and why, so the execs and share holders can make a few million more?  And for people like Ythisens who literally lost their dream job, that must really, really suck. 
---
The banter in a strong dungeon group of strangers. 
---
I finally broke and have been leveling on a place that will not be named. I spent 3 hours in SM last night with total strangers and had a frickin' blast. Not a single wipe - just smooth teamwork and good vibes. It's an absolute pleasure to operate as a unit with a bunch of people I've never met.
---
My biggest issue with it was low-level.  I liked in TBC to be able to go into WSG at 19 and farm marks to get the items available there.  And then to go to WSG and AB at 29 and get the higher levels of the WSG items and the AB items.  And then at 39, to prepare for the upgrade to plate or mail, if my class can.

Did he really produce/provide anything useful? He made a few blue posts that didn‚Äôt amount to much. 
---
&gt; , a little button that allows you to "close" the chest
---
A lot of people seem to leave the lone Dwarven Mild in there as a troll, I don't think this would serve to be too useful tbh.
---
Retail has abandoned too many compelling game design aspects in favor of a Diablo 3-esque paradigm that, quite frankly, has no business in being in an alleged RPG.
---
The strongest parts of retail are honestly more akin to Pokemon, The Sims, and slot machines.
---
Investors don't care about a game that isn't going to be monetized, and Blizzard certainly wants Classic to be a small passion project and nothing more unless they want to feel the wrath of investors wondering why extensive resources are going to a non-monetized game.
---
Well, I didn't ask what you don't love about vanilla.
---
I love vanilla to death with all its flaws and everything exactly as it is. That said, I can acknowledge that *objectively* there are some flaws.
---
I can love vanilla, want to play it, want nochanges for classic and at the same time see that the rank 14 PvP system was insane and TBC had better class balance.
---
I think it's good that the balance in high end wasn't split perfectly. I would argue that TBC is the perfect balance between class balance and homogenization. 
---
As far as class balance, every class *at least* had a spec that they could perform excellently in. In vanilla, druids had 0 cutting edge specs, since even resto was subpar. Compared to BC, where they can comfortably heal and tank. As raids get further along, they can trim certain specs in favor for more powerful ones, but every spec is still much more useful, and it makes raid organization much more of a minigame, since you have so many more options and combinations.
---
As far as homogenization, I can't really think of a single instance where classes became more like each other. Maybe Victory rush, since Warriors could heal now? But that's pretty tiny.
---
I would say the Druid requires slightly less time overall than the lock, but they are pretty close. 
---
The MOST time consuming really are the tanks/fury warriors/rogues who need to farm a ton of consumables and buffs and such.
---
As a healer druid, you wont really miss out on much if you cant log on early to get world buffs, or farm extra consumables and stuff like that. You will also get handed a lot of free loot since there will only be a couple druids compared to other classes. Still definitely desired class though. Basically you will get away with having to do less since youre a healer. Even if you dont have mana pots some tryhard melee might be willing to sponsor you if you work out a deal with him to always put hots on him during certain fights since warriors get more damage by staying in the fight and taking damage (lol i did this with some of my buddies)
---
Warlocks do have to farm Soul Shards, but that doesnt take much time at all if you are proactive about getting them again while inside the raid (at the expense of a small amount of dps)
---
You don't like walking to Ratchet for 10 minutes getting berated by a damn Blood Elf only for him to get killed by a level 60 Alliance at the end of it?
---
sounds pathetic lmfao
---
Yeti horns before they upped the drop chance was fucking insane
---
Also heard about aged gorilla sinew but I guess I've always been lucky there 
---
Maybe they're trying to become adventurers. 
---
Hmm, I don't think so. Homogenization of classes ruined the game, but it didn't happen until later on (Cata+). TBC had maybe the best class balance there was, even better than vanilla. Disagree?
---
It would be quite ridiculous if they got it *absolutely perfect* on the first try (Vanilla) when they didn't know that much what they were doing yet, without any tweaks. The design philosophy was awesome and it needed some work done on it and polishing.
---
&gt; It's hard to take a hardship angle on that one, it isn't like the  company needed to free up funds if they made record profits. That's why  people don't like it, which I think is legitimate. 
---
But, you shouldn't only fire people, because to free up funds for a project or something else. You can fire people for billions of reasons and one of them could be strategic changes. No normal, or a majority of companies out there, employ people just because they can. They do it because they're needed and used with the current strategic plan. You can absolutely have a record year and still fire people with good reason.
---
You‚Äôre just attacking OP and being passive aggressive as shit. 
---
We dont know how addons will work in Classic yet.
---
If you are spending 10 years working as a customer support rep...  that's on you..  
---
I miss my guildies
---
We still have a small core of folks between IG and FB, but just chatting back and forth has all stopped. We never needed anything important to talk about, just log in and say what's up, and see where the night took us. Once that was finished and we called it, there was still like 30mins worth of chatting about randomness until we logged off.
---
See a sample of the difference below:
---
Retail(normal) WoW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2veIeIexTU
---
Classic(vanilla) WoW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPz9jczghDc&amp;t=3s
---
Why do people have such a problem with this? 
---
So sick of seeing people whine about 'balancing' classes.
---
Mages are powerful, it makes sense for them to be able to do this. 
---
Ever seen a mage get smacked by a warrior? it's the same story. 
---
I'm very much looking forward to only playing with NA players, I'm sure EU/RU feels the same
---
I don't think it means anything, it's not like Classic is as big of a project as a brand new game or expansion, it's a recreation. If even Warcraft 3: Reforged, a fully-fledged remake, isn't considered a major release, then I don't think we have much to worry about with Classic not being considered as such.
---
Huh? I am saying later expansions (namely TBC) got the class balance better than vanilla. And I really think it's the objectively truth and I mean it.
---
It doesn't mean I want paladins to have crusader strike in summer when Classic comes lol. 
---
Not to sound like the usual lefty banter of big business bad but ...
---
Investor based, meta-marketing across nearly all platforms is a major issue. They have gained too much power. Consumer feedback is a risk. Consumer choice is a risk because they may leave for another product. These are cornerstones of genre specific marketing (the capitalism America was built on) and absolutely required for a healthy market.
---
Industry realized how much they were at risk, so have (through money influence and legislature) been removing consumer influence on a yearly basis. Media is largely controlled by industry (Disney owns nearly all of the media outlets most get their promos through for example), social media is a political field of landmines, meta-marketing ensures independent products are affected by development schedules, media promotion rotations and shared funding all trying to cater to a collective audience that otherwise has nothing to do with each other (MMORPG players don't normally give a shit about how well Candy Crush is doing and don't want their hundreds of millions invested into Wow put into other games ... which they most certainly have been doing since Activision too over).
---
Genre gaming is dead. Independent markets are dead. Consumer power is dead. Quarterly reports and stockholder percentage earnings is the ONLY thing that matters. 
---
They are going mobile because it's a market that is the size of both console and PC market combined (ignoring the fact that BILLIONS can still be made in each separate market). It's MAXIMUM profits, regardless of the health of individual products AND individual communities. 
---
A subscription based game "can" make a company profit year after year after year ... it just doesn't make big industry enough profit. This is something many brainwashed consumers do not understand. They are pawns of the engine.
---
I myself am now torn on either a troll mage or orc warlock. Back in retail vanilla-wotlk I played a warlock and loved it. I know I would enjoy warlock but at the same time I want to try something new. Definitely love casters and want to stick to that and I will play on a pvp server. Also looking to do raiding and all that jazz down the road as well as some pvp, but mostly a focus on pve. Let the opinions come out to play! 
---
Just a 60 hunter you pull out just for DM Trib.  The gold per hour would justify leveling one. 
---
Warlock soul shards seem quite intrusive, plus I hate relying on pet AI. 
---
Yeah I know FAP doesn't do the trick.  Well, bring a trinket.  Honestly how many bosses in vanilla do we even need to worry about?  2 in MC?  Can muscle through any MC bosses with literally any 40 people geared in garbage.
---
Ah ok.  Sounds like a good idea 
---
Agreeing with one of Activision-Blizzards financial decisions makes you a bad guy around here.  I understand.
---
Held my attention until bashing America and capitalism.   
---
Why would they actually invest in it or let it grow naturally though? The way the world works, they buy the company for a bil let's say, milk it dry and make 5 bil in 5 years. If they actually run it properly, it might last 30 more years instead of 5, and they might make more money from it, but potentially less money per year than milking it dry so it isn't worth investing in it when they can just drain the next buyout. Even if the company sinks, the people at the top have 20 times what a normal person needs to retire, the only people hurt are the other employees.
---
I started around 2 months before the release of Burning crusade, so really I don‚Äôt consider myself a vanilla player because I was still figuring it all out and never really felt like a competent player until i dinged 70 and ran a Gruuls lair with my guild. I played a Druid right from the beginning up to BFA with a few breaks in between, I fell into the category of players who had invested so much time into my main that I didn‚Äôt have any alts because it was just taking away from my main character. 
---
I think in classic I‚Äôm going to play a melee class, maybe dwarf warrior/paladin but I tried them out on private servers and couldn‚Äôt get over how difficult it was to play at low levels, just spent all my time running to my corpse!
---
&gt; The second reason and more important reason is a failure to understand that MMO games are about players and avatars. I'd rather see a dwarf rogue and know that player likes to play a dwarf rather than wondering if they're a dwarf just because stoneform is strong.
---
I feel like reason could apply to a lot of things to the point of absurdity.  
---
Is that Frost Mage playing Frost because he likes Frost or just because Frost is strong?  
---
Is that Dwarf Rogue playing a rogue because because he likes to play a rogue or just because rogues are strong?
---
This doesn't mean that all specs or all classes should be identical. They shouldn't even be similar. People have made essays about how much they hate how classes have homogenized over the years. I do not agree that racials should be removed. Honestly I would have preferred it if racials had gone in the complete opposite. Make them *really* effect how you play, are played with, and are played against. A Tauren Warrior and an Undead Warrior are *very* different. They should not play identically to each other.
---
Theres a problem with the system when CEOs are getting paid multimillions and their workers can barely afford basic necessities. Do I realize theres a big problem? Yes. Do I have solutions for the problem? No.
---
wat
---
Salvation helps a ton, especially early on when guilds like to stack melee. As Horde you have to be more wary with your threat, you definitely can‚Äôt go ham like your Alliance friends. Big part of Horde raiding is finding a skilled tank who knows his stuff. While Alliance tanks don‚Äôt have to be nearly as good. 
---
Which workers can barely afford basic necessities?
---
That is a different expansion with different talents, balancing, and mechanics. Your grand plan is to make a 3 piece ret pally set bonus that gives them 15% mana regen in combat? 8 piece bonus that gives them taunt? Or are you asking for off spec set pieces that give them a 30% increase in dps relative to other classes wearing the same level gear? Stupid idea. 
---
This is disheartening. Diablo and Starcraft were my very first computer games. I've followed both to where they are now. I've always had a soft spot for Diablo but it is a shame to see the amount of neglect when there is SO much potential. :(
---
I really think you are blowing it out of proportion.
---
If you honestly feel that way - then Nothing i can say will undo that. (Not that you're expecting me to)
---
I personally don't agree with your perception of the game - However, if it isn't fun for you to play, then who am I to say you're wrong. 
---
I couldn't of put it better myself 
---
Sadly Classic will likely only support the modem macro format but hopefully adjust the API to emulate what could be done in the original game.
---
You can add conveniences to each ability by making a new macro like:
---
/script if GetUnitName("target")==nil then TargetNearestEnemy() end
---
/script if (not PlayerFrame.inCombat) then AttackTarget() end 
---
/cast Lightning Bolt
---
This auto attacks what's in the middle of your screen and closest. It begins your autoattack and casts the ability you want.
---
/script SpellStopCasting()
---
/script bI, bN, bIA = GetShapeshiftFormInfo(1); if bIA then CastSpellByName"Feral Charge" else CastShapeshiftForm(1) end
---
/script bI, bN, bIA = GetShapeshiftFormInfo(1); if bIA then CastSpellByName"Bash" else CastShapeshiftForm(1) end
---
/script cI, cN, cIA = GetShapeshiftFormInfo(3); if cIA then CastShapeshiftForm(3) end
---
This will leave any existing form on the 1st push of a button, enter Bear form on next button push and either charge or stun on the next button push and won't leave Bear form if you hit the button too many times. Cat has a similar macro but enters the cat into Prowl and turns on Track Humanoid with addition button presses and can even add powershifting:
---
/script u=UnitMana('Player'); c=CastSpellByName; f=UnitPowerType("Player"); if (u&lt;=30) and (f==3) then c"Cat Form"; elseif (f==0) then c"Cat Form"; end;
---
/script c=CastSpellByName; f=UnitPowerType("Player"); if not(f==3) then c"Cat Form" elseif not buffed("Prowl") then c("Prowl"); end; if (f==3) then c("Track Humanoids") end
---
You can pool lines out and add to other macros and find many others to tweak to your own playstyle. This is huge for hunters because the base rules for macros is that you can only put multiple abilities together in sequence if they have a cooldown or do not trigger the GCD (if I remember correctly). Typically pet commands do not affect this so you can also throw in pet commands into your own abilities.
---
Macro tips are nearly endless and some of the best resources are often old Nost threads but some have been carried over to newer private server forums. 
---
Also, all this is meaningless with the new API likely but work on private servers.
---
I think the point is that people are skeptical that a major restructuring and 800 layoffs was necessary after a record year. 
---
If they were cutting costs, they wouldn't be hiring more people to work on mobile games. Also, cutting costs only works up to a certain point and is only a short-term growth strategy. It doesn't work in the long run. You can only cut so many costs before there isn't any more fat to trim.
---
It's disappointing that they aren't making the games we are all used to, but they gotta create earnings growth  somehow. They are beholden to their stockholders.
---
I made a similar video in wrath where I took clips of me 1 shifting undergeared players. Took about 3 weeks of doing BG‚Äôs everyday for 4 hours to get 4 min of clips.
---
I don't know why you are getting downvoted. These chumps are all idiots. I'm a fanboy all the same but atleast we understand the big picture
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
When they figure it out maybe they'll put their credit cards away lol.
---
It boils down to "You need to git gud to succeed on horde".
---
If you're not competent enough to dish out high dps and manage threat, Alliance is probably for the best. Horde have none of the safety nets alliance do. The trade-off is much, MUCH higher melee dps if you're tank is good enough (gear and skill) to build very high threat.
---
The rank 14 pvp system won't matter if they release it with BWL. No one will do it since the gear is equal to BWL gear. It will actually be easily done at that point since bracket 1 will be so low since no one is pushing caps. 
---
Sometime during WoD they brought back a 40-man queue-able MC that was sort of scaled up. People say there were terrible times with people not knowing the mechanics and blowing themselves up on Core Hounds over and over - but personally, that wasn't my experience. I only queued for it once to get the pet but we 1-shot everything and it was just a very long LFR.
---
Because we are addicted.
---
I agree. I understand why they had to do it... but my dream, even now, with classic on the horizon, is for them to have moving on to the next server be OPTIONAL.
---
The only thing that stinks private servers (well aside from the gold selling and admin abuse stuff) is that one day, they will end. And that day might just be because 1 single person got bored, got in a car accident, decided they didnt want to pay server fees anymore, whatever. Some random guy is russia is controlling everything you worked for.
---
My ideal situation would be official blizzard servers, so I could come and go as I please, go back and play my characters years later with other people doing the same. Sure maybe after X number of years they would have to merge a server or two, but I would be okay with that if it was only done out of necessity when populations dropped below a reasonable point until they had all of the old players on just 1 server. If it truly truly were dead, then it would cost almost nothing to leave a single classic server up, a single tbc server up, etc.
---
As they open new expansions, they could have people "opt-in" to moving there and continuing their journey - and it would fit the lore too with random new adventurers going through the dark portal. We could also just choose to NOT take the dark portal and stay on classic forever. Even if they never released additional 60 content (which would be a cool option to opt-in to as well) they could just let it progress to end patch and stay there.
---
a boy can dream.. lol
---
What do you mean? Don't you have a phone!?! Have to be excited for Diablo Immortal!
---
Now kiss ...
---
I'd say the majority just don't want the hassle of having junk in their bags. 
---
They see their players as revenue sources, not players looking to enjoy a well made product.
---
&gt;I think the point is that people are skeptical that a major restructuring and 800 layoffs was necessary after a record year.
---
No, they're not. They're shitting on Blizzard for doing this, even when they had a 'record year' in terms of revenue. It's literally in this thread and the "open letter" from the guy who used to be a GM.
---
"needed work" "polishing" any change made will have unintended consequences. No changes. "absolutely perfect" there is no such thing and it is completely subjective. You might want a pro pally rework, other people don't. The private server community which made classic happen to begin with DOES NOT WANT CHANGES. 
---
He's a leader and responsible for a $33 billion dollar company. They get paid what the market deems that they're worth. CEOs are often poached by other companies.
---
They more than likely had a quota to fill from a management perspective. You need to reduce your staff by 'X' amount. We'd all love for Classic to be a priority but frankly Wow and Classic are not a priority in the bigger picture. It wouldn't surprise me if they sacked the majority of CM's and this guy was probably not high enough up the pole to have influence. This is business and sometimes it sucks. He'll move on to bigger and better things trust me, this is a great decision for that guy
---
&gt;Both because of a severe lack of significant boss mechanics and vastly superior theorycraft that resulted in a massive powercreep, turning most encounters into a 30 seconds DPS rush training dummy.  
---
I would like to point out here that, not only players have gotten better, talents were different, gear was different, overall knowledge and shit was really bad compared to nowadays.  
---
BUT, my biggest issue that HELPS SOOOO MUCH to this, is the existance of DBM.  
---
DBM is the cancer of wow, everyone nowadays knows and is forced to use addons, an addon that makes an encounter, NOT A FANTASY, but just a series of timers that everyone can see, is a fucking joke, insulting for the genre and just make shit require 200x less skill.  
---
&gt;Another one, less impactful flaw in my eyes, is the abundance of consumables  
---
As a pvp player, they are pretty fun, but there's sooo many for each situation, and if we talk about flasks in pve... well, theorically people IN GENERAL didnt tryhard to get a full raid full flasked (and lack of knowledge etc etc), but yeah nowadays its a boost that might be too OP 
---
Explaining why decursing is necessary, corehound packs need to be aoe'd down, living bomb fun, showing everyone the window to see ragnaros
---
Lol that doesnt mean capitalism is evil. Like I said, capitalism is a system designed to give consumers the BEST product at the BEST price. 
---
Assigning ideas like good and evil have no place here and is a childlike view of the world.
---
He already took a shit on his managers desk.  I think it‚Äôs too late. 
---
So we should start setting arbitrary limits on how much wealth people can acquire?
---
What T3 is obtainable? How? BMAH?

---
They could just start issuing a lucrative dividend.. there are tools in the toolbox to maintain their share price. It's sad to see them going down the path of EA
---
^
---
Well considering I quit shortly after AQ40 then I don't even remember MC being brought back
---
Well yeah. They're dumping on blizzard because they're skeptical this move was one made of necessity, but rather one made out of pure greed. Basically the difference between "these circumstances necessitate we make this change and unfortunately it involves layoffs" and "we figured we could make even more money if we make these changes, so we cut these employees loose".
---
The second one isn't going to endear you with the public. Again, as I said in my original post, this stuff isn't shocking for corporate America. But Blizzard was once seen as a company that was above this stuff, a group of passionate gamers who put the games first. It's becoming clear that isn't Blizzard anymore.
---
It's disappointing. I'm not one of those "BOYCOT BLIZZARD!!11!" folks, but it's disappointing that this company appears to have fallen into the trappings of standard corporate America.

I have a couple EU friends that my group plays other games with.

We're just ganna have them play on NA Servers, lag honestly would still be less than what people experience on private servers.
---
Awsome üòò
---
Most dungeons are relatively simple and aren't that hard. People just sucked back then.
---
Awful loot tables. Itemization makes vanilla really interesting, don't get me wrong. But when you go to Scarlet Monastery, clear all the wings 3 times and never see an item that could be even partially good for you, then something is wrong. Initially I was happy I was the only leather in group, then later I figured why: nothing drops there for leather people. At all.
---
Simple rotation for some builds. I did a dungeon today (one of the SM runs) as feral cat DPS and I almost fell asleep in the end. There is just nothing really difficult or interesting about it. Every pull is the same, in every dungeon. With tanking at least I can lead the party.
---
You think anybody wants to be the CEO of a fortune 100 company, if they got, lets say, 5 or 10 times the money a regular employee got, let alone actually be qualified to do it? And more importantly, do you think a proper CEO is someone you find as easily, as a GM or a CM?
---
People like to meme about people wearing suits being out of touch with the people working on a ground level, which is true in some cases. But it's also a fucking big boy job, with a lot of responsibility.

According to this article he was getting paid 10$ an hour im California. Even 10 years ago thats not paying your rent and utilities.
---
That's basically slave labor but instead of getting provided room and board he's paying it himself.
---
No search bars for professions.
---
i get being burned by blizzard before, but why would getting rid of GMs who provide customer service make blizzard go ''oh fuck now we need an easy grouping tool'' is not like they're cartoon villains that are now throwing darts to see which retail features make it in lol
---
My grandfather (who is 78 and still raids with me) bought me classic when I was 9 years old. 
---
He paid my subscription and my first gaming. He taught me the ropes and helped me get to 60 right before BC launched. 
---
It wasn't until Wrath until I was old enough to really start pushing content and we did it together. We were server first for LK. 
---
We have played together the entire time and we plan on playing classic together. 
---
I dont think this means anything, are they not considering call of duty a frontline release? If they aren't, theres no way they'd consider classic WoW one to be.
---
Even though I still think they are massively underselling classic WoW, it's going to be the number 1 game on Twitch
---
Record Revenue is not the same as record profits. I don't know what their finances look like, and this is a shitty look for them the way they handled it, but it is not as simple as people make it. What was their actual profit, vs that revenue? On top of it with the huge loss in stock price (Half the value it held a year ago) what did they have to do to shore that up and keep investors from bailing? (The stock price supposedly shot up on this announcement) They have a legal duty to make the most money they can for their shareholders. Perhaps the executives should have taken some of the hit to their own compensation, but it is a hard sell for someone to give up their own money in these cases.
---
Druids can stay alive vs rogues and warriors in world PvP when equally geared. 
---
This is the same as...
---
&gt;I played Call of Duty 4 and Modern Warfare 2, and I was recently informed about think Call of Duty World at War; and it would benefit by not being a WWII game and having F-16 airstrikes, and M16's because that's how the other games were.
---
Literally none of what you wrote is my idea. I don't wanna change anything.
---
Most here aren't adults. Doubt many even played in vanilla
---
Thanks m8
---
Yeah wrath is when the homogenization started for real, when they gave ret paladins and hunter that buff that made them mana batteries like shadow priests. And wrath was the end of progression based raiding and they started just having you do the same raid on a higher difficulty.
---
&gt; If even Warcraft 3: Reforged, a fully-fledged remake, isn't considered a major release,
---
This is exactly the point that everyone has to keep in mind. They're reading too far into that line. WC3: Reforged and WoW Classic are basically just re-releases, not major releases. They're still coming.
---
Honestly? People should be happy they're not trumpeting WoW Classic to investors. They're calling it a passion project when communicating with their players, and not discussing it with their investors. This should tell you everything you need to know about their mindset.
---
We clearly don't agree on this. Nice talking to you though.
---
They are exactly the same in the sense that you use your left hand fingers to press buttons on a keyboard and your character will initiate actions that kill bad guys. You get rewarded for killing bad guys. 
---
Finding retail's storytelling enjoyable is pretty telling. 
---
Fury being strong means there's more tanks on the server, and rewards warriors for the leveling grind/gearing grind. Prot pallies can turn the high level instances into speed runs and cake walks for the group. Which, when you're running instances all day can be a real nice change of pace.
---
I remember in BC when prot pallies were viable for basically everything, it really dumbed down the game. Tank just runs in and AOEs, and there's never any trouble/excitement.
---
Yeah because people never lie about knowing fights....
---
I've been a RL in pugs for the last few expansions and even when I offer to explain an encounter, people still stay quiet, fuck up the pull and then bitch. 
---
I got it first kill on Netherwing. Good scripting my ass! (or luck, but that's less funny)
---
I love this. I met a friend in Wrath to do some random quest in Dragonblight and we are friends still. Have met IRL, talked each other off ledges, etc. Good feels.
---
At this point, I can only think that Activision allowing Blizzard to do it's "little side project" outside of any meta-marketing control ...
---
IS A VERY VERY GOOD THING!
---
Let's not worry about this at this time, as long as Classic is still being worked on.
---
As long as stupid idiots and whales keep dropping 10x the money on useless misconstructions, exactly -- why would they care about having 10x less players if they are still getting the same profit margins for much less effort?
---
I cannot believe this guy is losing magic internet points because you guys don't understand how corrupt the American system is. It's just beyond pointless to try and argue with this level of ignorance in any detail but I will add just one point:
---
Warren Buffet's effective tax rate is around 16%. He pays less taxes (as a %) that his secretarial staff. 
---
MURICA, F\*CK YEAH.
---
Yeah same here, that is one change that I liked, when they removed the soul shard reagent cost from their spells. It kind of fits their lore though, which I think is cool.. but it would be better balanced around them only being able to have a few of them rather than stack entire bags. Because that leads to a scenario where you play late into the night, forget to re-stock, and log back on unable to do basic things until you go fight for a bit.. kinda tastes bad haha
---
If you're playing sm/ruin you just seduce one and deathcoil the other and dot him while you run away from the seduced one... if everyone is geared obviously it might not be too easy to get away from two people, but you can definitely buy a lot of time.  
---
If you're playing SL you can sac vw and recast for a succ with very short cast time, then seduce one and deathcoil the other.  With the vw shield you should have plenty of time to make that happen.
---
&gt; wat
---
Blizzard is an American company.  America is a capitalist nation.
---
Well, I am part of that community... I played vanilla since it was called Pre-TBC. I love vanilla to the core. And what? Does that make me more or less entitled for an opinion?
---
And again: I don't want changes in Classic! But to not acknowledge some flaws of Vanilla would be delusional. 
---
Why do I have to repeat it all the time? People see mild criticism of vanilla and immediately see in red. They see "changes in classic". It's not that. I hoped the bold part would be enough.
---
Why is __everybody__ always talking about raids? Even end-game you don't constantly raid.
---
Yeaj, BMAH.
---
I mean, it shouldn't be surprising? They didn't announce an SC or Diablo title at Blizzcon. Were you expecting a release for those franchises in 2019? They could still announce something for them at the 2019 Blizzcon though.
---
I'd stop short of saying that I don't sympathize with people losing their jobs.  That sucks.  But you're right, Blizzard did seem to operate better when it was a leaner, more well-oiled machine.
---
If we all had infinite time to play it wouldn't be a big deal, but with time restrictions... say you only have 2 hours to play and you reallllllly want that one item from Mara... it might take you that long to get everyone there!  I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying that some of those conveniences are so tempting when you are limited on time.
---
&gt; Perhaps the executives should have taken some of the hit to their own compensation, but it is a hard sell for someone to give up their own money in these cases.
---
Yeah, but that's not going to endear you with the public. Cutting loose 800 people rather than lowering your millions of dollars in compensation isn't going to get a good reaction. It's understandable why people would be put off by that.
---
If that is the case, isn't it better to give melee dps tranquil air totem to enable them to do more damage? Or ideally... it might be worth having an enhancement shaman totem twisting between windfury and tranquil air.
---
Nope, you will be fine.
---
Gnome is SLIGHTLY better for 2 reasons
---
1) Extra Intelligence stat (barely makes a different, nothing like the +weapon skill for a rogue)
---
2) Escape Artist racial. This will let you kite people better in PvP. Irrelevant to PvE. Humans get perception which might let you see rogues in stealth too in certain situations, so thats a tradeoff too really. I myself prefer EA because of how often you can use it vs perception not always working even when you are 100% certain a rogue is on top of you (bc he just vanished and has extra effective stealth levels briefly etc. it basically is only good for finding rogues who are stealth and idle near you, not for pp who vanish mid combat)
---
I think you forgot your /s at the end. 
---
The two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.  Diablo 2 was pushed out in two or three years development time (depending on who you ask).  Diablo 3 took _at least_ eight, _not_ including the "old" Blizzard North Diablo 3 that got scrapped.
---
Lmao u must be new here
---
I loved the r14 pvp system. I quit pvp when they got rid of it.
---
I mean you can stance dance through 4/5 fears on most fights or dual tank them. But ally tanks tend to trip over their own feet so expecting them to know how to play their class is going a bit far.
---
Yes, the shamans who have the reduced mana totem talent and good enough gear can totem weave tranquil air and windfury totem at the start of fights.
---
But, this goes back to the Shaman's needing FAR More input and resource management than paladins. You need to make sure your totems are in range of your melee group at all times, not over spending mana on totem twisting tranquil and WF, not missing vital heals when you spend 2 globals totem twisting, etc.
---
Much MUCH harder and more demanding to pull off -- but more potential reward.
---
Haha nice! Yea, lots of good memories and fun shenanigans with those games. I used to overuse the hell out of the tesla coils because I thought they were so cool. :)
---
You ignored second half of my post.
---
All classes are viable for raids or whatever else.
---
Then just destroy it?  I got in the habit of destroying useless food all the time because it's usually quicker while soloing to just auto-loot everything and then when your bags are full or close to full, re-organize.  Destroy anything that isn't valuable and doesn't stack.
---
There's literally no reason to leave a single block of cheese in chests other than to troll any future comers to the area.
---
That's one sour boi.
---
I'm all seriousness, this sucks for dozens of reasons, but in the end, we're all just consumers. This definitely sucks the most for those employees and families who were impacted by the layoffs.
---
F
---
Did you read the post? I assumed you were on the side of a writer. If you are just saying it sucks to be lain off. That I agree with.
---
Capitalism is a system designed to maximize profits at all costs. It's not designed to be a sustainable for the planet or the consumer. It's about cutting corners and being inhumane for a buck.
---
 It's definitely not about designing the best product its about designing the cheapest product and selling it for the most profit possible.
---
In general, criticizing developers is fine and a consumer right but ...
---
... I'm not seeing a single person throwing shade as Classic developers. They obviously fall outside of Activision Blizzard's bendover and reach around strategy with stockholders at this time. It likely saved the project and the proves this is a passion project.
---
I have zero insults to throw at them, and likely they are my last hope that big developers give a tiny shit about genre gaming anymore.
---
Except fear ward isn't vital, it's just better than the alternatives. It let's you run with bad tanks, ups the dps of your raid by allowing the tank to hold more threat, or it preventing a dps/healers from getting feared. In 90% of raid fights, fear ward is completely useless.
---
Well, classic WoW is not a "frontline release" so.. we're still good
---
Priest is super squishy. I ended up playing Holy in PvP and standing at the back keeping dudes alive and running for dear God when I got focused.
---
It isn't surprising just a bummer. I have very mixed feelings with how everything has been handled at Blizzard. Plus, I'm not very good at being patient and desperately want something new for Diablo.
---
Naxx and PVP gear kind of ruin the game.
---
Yeah! I was sitting here thinking why we would insult or bash the people that are making the game we are all hoping to play sometime within the next few months. 
---
Plot twist: they are both guys, who think the other is a girl irl
---
Agree, crazy how to do your mc quest for the rune dousing water you have to go drive out 20 minutes into the middle of nowhere haha.
---
I hope if classic is as big of a hit as I think it will be (provided they do it right... #NoChanges lol...) that one day they will get to have a team devoted to producing additional 60 content in the same theme and players can choose to opt-in to a server like that or stay with the true classic experience if they desire.
---
Although if that happens, I hope Activision splits off and sells the blizzard IP to a different studio or something. This recent news isnt looking good for these kind of ideas :(
---
Just spell 'rogue' correctly you stupid apes.
---
That is all.
---
It‚Äôs popular to hate on the game because it‚Äôs in the worst state it has ever been in.
---
&gt; Not when the reality is that very few people actually go through the trouble of buying the diploma.
---
You have no data or any statistic to back that up. I was in a boosting/carry group for a short time and you'd be absolutely amazed at how many people buy boosts every single day. In WoD mid-to-end HFC (middle of the worst content drought in WoW's history) I remember we were doing 2-3 carries in the course of an hour with 18-20 people being carried on every run, with players from all realms. I only did it for a few hours at a time and only for a handful of days but we never had any issues finding other players.   
---
Your 1% estimate is just a fart in the wind for me. 
---
It's still an interesting perspective. Well written and worth the read.
---
Yeah, I hear you. I'm hopeful that D4 will finally be in a state that is ready to be announced this year at Blizzcon.
---
Shit to work at and shit to play. Wonderful.
---
I had always assumed it paid minimum $15 an hour. Especially considering the fact you need to uproot your life and move to Anaheim to work for Blizzard.
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean any of those things.
---
First thing you have to get set straight is that any class' given T2/T2.5 isn't even necessarily used in PvE because many are statted for PvP. This question really doesn't need to be focused on specifically T2/T2.5 at all
---
Second, the answer depends on the specific guild. There is no set in stone rule for how loot council works. In any reasonable LC, top (non tank) performers don't get literally every single piece of gear. That is a corrupt LC. If you're asking about the ideal world, then yes, every loot decision will be made on a case-by-base basis factoring in all other gear the player's have, attendance, other important future pieces, attitude, skill, etc. If you're asking how it will play out, then that should be evident to you once you've raided with the guild in question for a month or two and experienced how the leadership of your guild operates.
---
Pally (or shaman) if you want to PvP heal and not be squishy. If you want to continue to PvP heal as a priest just have to play super smart, never putting yourself in unnecessarily dangerous positioning and having a smart team that knows how to focus fire and protect you.
---
Honestly you should consider shadow for PvP if you want to stay priest!
---
Priest raid healing does have a dark side like you noted. We can get so good we can get wrapped up in topping meters which leads to sniping.. that‚Äôs just not good for the raid or guild as a whole. Sniping heals is the bad kind of healing. I‚Äôd try and find a guild come launch with a more mature chief / priest class leader to cut that shit out and actually communicate with your fellow priests. That kind of healing synergy is way more satisfying than exhausting yourself and pissing your guild mates off trying to top some meaningless meter.
---
There's not a whole lot of classes that are actually interested in full T2. The same goes for T2.5, which, importantly, is a bit of a weird tier set to begin with. Most T2.5 sets actually support non-raid specs or even moreso PvP stats.
---
Aside from that, loot is very scarce and even while in AQ40 there's some high quality or even BiS pieces still found in MC, which due to the quantity of loot will *still* be desired even at that point.
---
Loot councelling in vanilla is hard, because stuff usually isn't so clear cut. It's probably why you hear so many horror stories around here of guilds that continuously give priority to their top raid members, even if the other raid members are lagging behind considerably. Personally I'd recommend doing little to no favouritism and only prioritising tier pieces to players if it involves an immediate set bonus upgrade from that specific piece, or if the 8/8 for that class is actually desired (very rare). It's not 100% ideal perhaps, but creating drama just to squeeze out a little more DPS that you don't even really need is just not worth it in the long term.
---
ITT: Naive kids who don't know how corporations work. They owe you NOTHING. Your company doesn't give a single shit about you! It's not a two way relationship, no matter your emotional allegiance to them... it's not reciprocal, AT ALL. You are a human resource, a headcount, a number, etc. You are not entitled to human respect from your employer, especially in California, an at-will employment state. Lesson learned for these people hopefully, and shame on this author for framing this story as someone who was one of the recently laid off -- he hasn't worked for Blizzard in 8 years.
---
Love it!!
---
Glad we're celebrating the social aspects of older WoW in a non toxic way where the modern game needs to be attacked to justify the older one. Just happy about good things we got to do. And the joy justifies itself.
---
Yes roge and roggue kill me. Also commonly misspelled is the popular huntard class. Sometimes you see uneducated people spell ‚Äòhunter‚Äô.
---
Found the problem with the system, folks. People who are delusional and selfish like this guy 
---
Apparently you're a fan of severe wealth disparity. Cool. 
---
This would be a case by case basis for sure. There are so many variables that come into things like this. 
---
With the small amount of information you gave, you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd go to the person with the least amount of T2 and doing the best dps. However like I said before, there are a lot more variables that come into play. Attendance, attitude, chance of the person leaving the guild, when the person got their last piece of gear... I could keep going.
---
Retail is a fantastic single player game with social chat functionality.  Classic was an actual MMORPG.  Different games.   
---
I loved vanilla WoW. It was the best gaming experience I have ever, and probably will ever, have.    
---
    
---
I tolerate retail WoW.  It has some cool stuff going for it, and it can be fun in small doses. But it isn't anything like the game used to be. It feels way too curated and "accessible" to the point where I don't feel that weight of importance or sense of satisfaction from my game sessions anymore.  It's just like playing through any grindy single player RPG on easy mode.
---
This isn't he Capitalism America was built upon. That was specific genre marketing (the best product/business wins by servicing a demand). You make a product, the consumers like it and buy it, company profits. End of story.
---
Today the consumer is a annoyance. Stockholders steer the direction a company goes and NOT the product and service provided to the consumer. This is a total corruption of Capitalism. People are so far gone and ignorant of this that they do not realize it.
---
Consumer are SUPPOSED to have the power. This has been stripped from them. This is corruption ... it is not the original American Capitalism.
---
What are some of your favorite WoW moments? TBC? 
---
Ohhh boy, early drinking days were really something... I had to be escorted inside before I started a fight with the neighbors, and I just remember yelling 'BRO!' a lot.
---
Blizzard is a shit company.  Is this news?  All publicly owned game companies are basically shit companies.
---
No idea what macros will and won't work.
---
I'm on team no changes but I secretly hope that showtooltip is there.
---
Gorilla Sinew, Akiris Reed, that stupid gem that drops in ashenvale for Alliance, those pages in the mine for the Barrens Samophlange questline....the memories. The memories are the rarest and most precious of all.
---
First off, t2.5 isn't even good for a lot of classes/builds, so not everyone wants it. Next, the t2 set bonuses are often very strong, so you would want to prioritize maintaining those bonuses when possible.
---
They did announce a Diablo title at Blizzcon, just not the one you wanted to hear about.
---
Yeah no. It's not about cutting corners. That is a tactic but it's not the ONLY tactic. Some companies find success in providing a different, transparent, honest business model and are rewarded by keeping loyal consumers.
---
Your issue is you and the baggage you're bringing to this
---
Is that really a plot twist?
---
It's not Frontline to INVESTORS. This is a good thing. Less of a chance of monetization if it's not considered frontline to their investors and shareholders.   
---
MAKING THIS GAME OUT OF SIGHT TO INVESTORS IS A GOOD THING.  
---
Don't forget this.  
---
&gt; You can't afford spending 10 minutes looking up everyone who whispers you for gear/enchants/logs/whatever else you want to base your recruiting off of.
---
Then don't be a raid leader. I'm not saying you are/were like this but there's so many shitfaced wannabe raid leaders who half the time didn't even have curve themselves, doing "raid leading" by inviting people based on curve and doing generic markings.
---
It takes less than 1 minute to check:
---
* gear Ilvl and stats 
---
* ask a generic question about a specific gimmick in the raid ("you know what to do on X boss?") 
---
&gt;  it works
---
It works because 9/10 times people are overgearing the fuck out of the raid. Ever notice how the min. ilvl required by these PUG "leaders" is always 5-15 ilvls over the ilvl in the raid on top of the bloody curve? 
---
I have done the quest a couple times, but I remember fondly leveling a warrior on a pserver and literally spending there 3 and a half hours (no kidding) and then, on another server, I rolled another warrior and I got it exactly on the first mob.
---
Honestly, after the experience of doing the grind, it felt kinda good that I got it first try, but I would never say "take away the grind". Brings nostalgia.
---
I‚Äôm rolling a troll priest but plan to run to Brill at level 5, and do Tirisfal/Silverpine. ^^
---
Leveling is always fun to a degree. WOD was probably the best leveling experience I had. But the fact is the item progression in the game has changed to the point that content doesn't mean anything. As a rated pvp player, I have gotten 75% of my upgrades from emissary chests, weeklys and warfronts. All basically solo content. Im in full heroic gear with a few mythic pieces week 3 or 4 of this season and have never stepped into a raid. 
---
Vanilla understanding of "Tier sets" is different from the retail one. 
---
Some pieces are good, while the others are not. I can't even recall someone using full T2 sets besides priests, hunters and warrior tanks if they needed to get the defcap, because there are better off-set pieces you could use instead of the full T2 which most people collected for the looks or PvP. 
---
Moreover, T2.5 sets for some classes are off-meta, like paladin one being ret gear or druid one being 100% hybrid gear so their prio is set accordingly. 
---
But it sounds like they don't want to...                                                  
---
Gonna do priest main / rogue alt myself. They do balance each other well.
---
The answer. 
---
Nowadays communities are about Reddit, Discord, Youtube, Twitter, etc and fan sites roles are small
---
I can't even recall when have I been on any game fan site at all
---
I think I have finally decided on what to do. Here are the classes I will play.  
---
RP-PvP:   
---
* Orc shaman duo level whenever my tauren warrior buddy is online. Level as hybrid &amp; go resto late game. Herb/alch
---
* Troll priest in my down time, possibly twink him @ 19,  &amp; 29. Priest is my favorite class and I want to wand people to death in 19 twink BGs, will probably pay someone for a BFD run just to get gravestone scepter quickly.   
---
* Whatever my gf plays I may play a feral druid with her whenever she desires to play/try the game.
---
I'm guessing I won't have much time for everything, maybe I will not make it very late into the game, but my decision stands to play a shaman as my main enjoy the leveling process on all characters. For playing with the gf I will purely try to let her decide every path to take and decisions to make.
---
The challenge. Leveling will actually be a little challenging. Leveling in retail is so boring because everything dies in 2 seconds.
---
Lol you're just salty because you're poor. If you want more money, be worth more money. If you can't add value to society, it's not societies job to hold your hand...
---
Nope  
---
They‚Äôre being fined $300 million by Sweden for NOT paying taxes on the acquisition.
---
So you booosted a couple hundred people... how many people do you think played the game at that point?
---
The remastered WC3 and Classic are frontline to me 
---
We're a mixed economy, parts capitalism &amp; parts socialism.
---
Thank you for sharing your experience! It sounds like horde requires multiple roles to perform at a high level for everyone to perform at a high level.
---
I've read that enh shamans are great candidates for totem twisting since they are doing white damage during those GCD's of totem twisting. They could also grab those juicy deep enh talents that buff windfury totem and strength of earth totem. To offset the low dps maybe have them equip an annihilator for more armor pen for melee.
---
This has happened so many times...popular community managers getting fired/leaving...it happens. We don‚Äôt know why the decision was made. But by all means, yes. It means Classic is doomed for sure.
---
Purging the sac shield on a warlock feels so good as a shaman.
---
It's difficult but man, if you are making $9 - $11 an hour for years, with nothing but resentment, and worry that you could lose your job, than maybe it's time to pick up and leave, or at the very least have a plan when the company you are working for is obviously declining for years and years. There are multiple night schools and community colleges *within 25 minutes* of blizzard headquarters with extremely low costs (really) that can get you jobs of $20 - $30 / hour with a few semesters of technical education. That's a fact. Maybe helping a game interaction / server mistake with a player isn't worth very much money. That might sound harsh but I know of millions of High Schoolers that would do that part time for $8 / hour.
---
horde side as a warrior you will sometimes have to actually intentionally not press buttons (gasp) and will always have to be aware of where you sit on threat in relation to whichever tanks/players are important for the given fight. The better your tank is and the better their gear is (Thunderfury hello) will give you more room to play with, but just by nature of windfury being semi-random you always need to at least be actively paying attention.
---
1. Engineering helps, for example getting a heal off during an iron grenade stun or using net-o-matic on a melee. Mostly you just have to deal with it.
---
2. This is a classic healing problem. If you have too many healers in the raid, which you should for 90%+ of fights, then healing can easily become a scramble to see who can heal damage first. Paladins are perfectly suited to this with their fast, mana efficient flash of light spam. Priests can use flash heal to waste mana and fluff their HPS when all they are really doing is stealing healing from other more responsible healers. Healing effectively requires a more team oriented mentality where everyone has addons installed that display when a target is being healed and don't start casting on those targets. If people respect the addon info then you should be able to cast heal or greater heal and contribute just fine. No doubt though regardless on many fights you will be very aware that you could go afk the whole fight and everything would be fine. That's just the nature of healing in a 40 man raid.
---
3. Paladin can survive for quite a while. I've played both paladin and priest in PvP and the difference is night and day. Compared to priest, paladin doesn't really need supportive allies to be successful. Plate, shield, and bubble/BoP keeps you safe from physical damage dealers, compared to priest which really needs someone peeling for them. Blessing of sacrifice prevents cc that break on damage like polymorph and seduction so don't need to hope that your DPS are on point with interrupting enemy casts as much. Etc. Not saying paladin is better than priest which has many advantages, but definitely not as dependent on support.
---
Akris Reed in STV was particularly bad.
---
Zebra hooves!
---
The problem with enhance shaman is their DPS is just... awful. On top, they don't have the mana pool to even spend any significant amount of time totem twisting in the first place.
---
Usually, you want 8 shamans per raid so every group has totems.  You really don't have the luxury to dump more slots on shamans who can't heal and already provide totem buffs.  Enhance is never idea in a pure raid environment. And in 5 mans, tranquil air is a global 20% reduced threat generation to everyone in the party, so its doesn't actually do anything in that case.
---
I would have thrown up on a PVE server without even having anything to drink. PVE is such a joke. Never played on one nor do I ever want to experience it. 
---
&gt; It is a voluntary system 
---
Not really. If you live in a capitalist system and can't get out then you're not necessarily there voluntarily are you? You're FORCED to interact w/ that system (or die). 
---
Thereisnospoon
---
We're talking about specs being useless. I don't care about being able to heal with my ret paladin character in raids. 
---
So while i'm not asking for anything to be changed, it is an objective flaw.
---
Depends on how long they have been raiding with the guild.
---
All I heard was corporate drivel that sounded like a murloc.
---
Would raiders who have no interest in PvP want that robe? It seems to  be great for PvP priests and locks (not sure about mages).
---
I just don't get why you would ever want to play on one. It's like they just ripped half the game out. Hating and killing allies is half the point. Honestly I am only here for this Hand of Rag so I can use it to hang Varians broken body from the walls of Orggimar! Well, maybe not Varian. I think he's a little kid in classic but Malfurion could get it.
---
If we are being fair the public doesn't give a shit. People who know those laid off, and some gamers might notice or care, nobody else does. Overall the stock price has gone up, investors are happy about it, and the executives only care what the investors think. 
---
It sucks, but overall this doesn't matter to very many people.
---
Who cares? If there's anything the last 4 months has taught us it's that communicating with this community is a complete nightmare. Gamers are the most entitled, whiniest people on the internet. 
---
You are the type that believes everything they hear from the systems mouth piece without questioning its validity. 
---
Your issue is you are so beholden to the system you can't think outside of it.
---
It is because ActiBlizz doesn't consider Classic WoW as a frontline release.
---
reads like a salty socialist who never achieved anything and is envious of people with succes.  Yawn
---
Very cool, nothing like watching 5 charge up and vaporize a mammoth tank
---
See you in Classic!
---
Well you're wrong. Voodoo shuffle was really useful for mythic Jaina. Rocket Jump was useful for mythic Kil'Jaedeen. The burst DPS of Beserking is more useful than 1% damage over an entire fight. Arcane torrent was ridiculously useful as everyone with it had an AOE silence.
---
stock buybacks were illegal until Reagan in the 80s.
---
People view it as a Left and Right thing, but the fact is the super wealthy in this country are using those on the Right to push their agenda to hoard more wealth.
---
Then instead of reinvesting in the company and its employees, they buy up their own stock to prop up the price which makes the execs look good and gets bigger bonuses
---
Then other companies will innovate and pass them up because instead of reinvesting in the company, they were paying off shareholders
---
Money really is the root of all evil, or at least the pursuit of wealth above all else. It's led to racism/sexism/basically every societal ill. I'd argue its the biggest issue of our time, more so than even climate change.
---
The answer is, of course, high taxes on corporations so we can provide a basic living standard to everyone else not benefitting from the rigged game of Monopoly we're all showing up to too late, but that won't happen until we all stop fighting each other down at the bottom of the barrel
---
In order to point out flaws, one needs to compare almost similar products, analyze if those flaws are actually flaws (and not different approach to something) and draw a conclusion.
---
Since such a comparison cannot be made with products that came AFTER Vanilla WoW, but only products that came BEFORE Vanilla VoW...Vanilla WoW doesn't have any flaws, only DIFFERENT approaches to certain features.
---
Same, luckily pservers will still be a thing so it really didn't matter.  We all knew Activision would never let the game be re released without cash shop and tokens
---
Well I'd say that racial uniqueness should come from quests and culture rather than gameplay advantage.
---
Cashing in while he can.  Honestly, and this might be a little mean, but if you work for a company for 8 years and still make $11 an hour you need to re-evaluate. 
---
&gt;A Tauren Warrior and an Undead Warrior are very different. They should not play identically to each other.
---
Yet they do. Are you arguing for massive stat differences that would make gnomes garbage melee classes. Should we have massive differences in speed because taurens have a much larger stride than gnomes.
---
When did a subscription based game become ‚Äúnot monetized‚Äù? o.O
---
I am starting to think it's going to release in the fall and not summer. 
---
In today's world, that's nothing. 
---
The Barrens, many buffs with short durations, stat allocation - hardly any int/spirit plate at end game, somehow getting str on cloth items even as quest rewards, The Barrens, some quest givers especially for dungeons (e.g. The Barrens for WC), some quests with unreasonably low item drop rates like Ashenvale for that red crystal for alliance or the Samophlange manual pages in the Barrens, The Barrens.  
---
Did I mention The Barrens?
---
Solid read haha
---
So people are working on it for free?
---
This is something I would have thought was a good idea and a productive use of my time when I was like 12. 
---
Seriously, what's the point of this? You're not dumb enough to think this is going to do anything, are you?
---
I think the major disconnect between you and the other opinions on this thread is that many people whose opinion mimic the OP (mine included) started out in games where time + effort = difficulty &gt; skill = rewards. Meaning that if I put more time and effort into playing the game, then my character should be some how better than people who put less time and effort into the game.  Given that this is a game, the amount of time you have dedicated to playing is perfectly good metric and often a direct correlation to how much you have seen of the content and how many secretes you have unlocked. If I spent 200 hours playing the game, then I should have x, y, and z and once you spend 200 hours playing the game then you can x, y, and z too.
---
EQ and Vanilla were very much based off of this concept. The more time you spent playing the more powerful your character got and there were unique gear/mounts/toys in the game that helped to distinguish you in the game and show eveyone one else that you play a lot. After all, the idea of playing is fun because your character is some how progressing and gaining power/advantage/prestige. You can use your time in game to achieve specific advantages, whether it was PvP titles, PvE raids, Rep grinding for special mounts, etc. You logged in, you put in the time, you came out with something better than the person who did not do the PvP grind, the 3X a week raids, or grind of mobs/hand ins for the special mount/title.
---
Modern WoW has taken much of this away because time and effort no longer offers an advantage. There is not a way to distinguish yourself from players who do not put the same level of effort into the game that you do, which negates the pleasure derived from doing those activities. No one really enjoys endless grinding, but they do get a sort of high from completing that goal and getting a unique item, and knowing that only people who went through that grind will have that item. 
---
What on earth are you jabbering on about. 
---
19
---
&gt;I really think you are blowing it out of proportion.
---
I don't really think I am. Maybe it's hyperbolic to say that the *best* part of retail WoW rests in collecting and pet battling, but it sure as hell isn't the class design, itemization, writing, or leveling (all elements that were incredibly compelling in vanilla). You're more than welcome to prefer the direction that retail has gone in over the years, but you cannot deny that WoW has grown to resemble Diablo 3 with each passing expansion.
---
Well considering they're rolling it into the current WoW sub this isn't surprising.
---
Is there a resource you used to learn about macros? I have played vanilla, played pservers, never got into macros and I want to learn
---
I mean you kinda do in Vanilla? There's no heroics. If you're in a raiding guild you're probably done with 5 mans after 4-6 weeks at lvl 60.
---
Lol wut
---
That is a Pvp only robe for spriests. Most classes mages and locks just used their tier set. This robe gives 32 stam which is really good
---
I have similar opinions though I would be even more harsh.  Tried the game in Legion after quitting in WOtLK and man was I dissapointed.  Retail WoW lost literally everything that made the game attractive to me.
---
What is there to indicate that the classic API will look like the vanilla API? They protected cast functions and whatnot for a very good reason. You can literally write a rotation bot. There is no fucking way there are letting them back in.
---
Actually yes, I do think there should be a maximum wage. Similar to a minimum wage. Don't get we wrong, it should still enable them to earn crazy money.....but not to the point where 1% own 99% of wealth.
---
Shocker, Blizzard is a shit company to work for.  
---
Since we're working off of the Legion client the 2nd moon is probably going to be in.
---
Evil
---
On the earnings call they alluded to multiple Diablo projects in the works (Immortal and otherwise). I wouldn‚Äôt give up hope yet. I think Blizzard took note of the fans reaction and desire for new PC / Console content for Diablo, it‚Äôs just not something they can realistically put together in 12 months. 
---
One title yes, but it's been constantly developed throughout the entirety of that time. As far as I am concerned quality trumps quantity.
---
You are correct. And that is exactly the problem.
---
Wrong. You don't know me and your conclusions are based off imagination. Just like your arguments
---
You‚Äôve never played competitive PvP in WoW, I take it. You put Detect Magic on the sheep target so a priest/pally has a 50/50 chance of cleansing the sheep. 
---
100% this. I said this elsewhere and Non-american socialists be cryn and downvoting lol
---
How do you draw that conclusion? 
---
You haven't been able to distinguish between Activision and Blizzard for a long time.
---
Perfect analogy. 
---
Same. Classic is the final last ditch attempt and then I'm out. The only reason I'm giving classic a chance is because it was already designed by great game designers. So if they screw that up......they really are beyond hope.
---
*Laid
---
The lack of empathy
---
You're right, it's monetized but in the same package as Battle for Azeroth. Not sure if and how that matters, but what definitely matters is that micro transactions generate a lot more revenue than the monthly subscriptions. Not to forget that making and maintaining Classic WoW costs money, while selling a store mount in BfA doesn't. So even if Classic WoW is a huge success with many new subscribers, it might be pretty unimpressive for investors IF Classic won't have a cash shop. So you could also see this as a positive sign that Blizzard might not monetize Classic WoW like they do it in BfA. I think that is what Soupa means, although I'm not sure why he is so certain that Classic won't be monetized as it has never been confirmed from Blizzards side afaik.
---
Corporations were given a $1.5 trillion tax break in 2017. That's tax payer money. It was supposed to create jobs. Instead, they all took that money, bought back stocks to jack up the value, and laid off employees.
---
I couldn't agree more, and I extend that to the lack of communication about the progress on Classic. With all the other shit coming out of AB over the past several months, I'm of the firm belief that, where Classic is concerned, no news is good news.
---
What is the difference? The government is still stealing their money.
---
Stranglethorn vale.
---
Sorry that I‚Äôm salted at money-grubbing bastards ruining a game I played since I was little to the point I‚Äôm not willing to play it because it makes me feel worse than the desire to play.
---
This "PvE made me vomit" seems a lot like "the camera adds 10 pounds." Just as it might have been all the food and not the camera, it might have been all the alcohol and not the PvE.
---
Hoooollyy moly, man. I just did this on a P server and damn. I got a full level in the high 30s doing this. Killed hundreds of green whelps over the course of a few hours. So glad I was a Skinner, made it worth it.
---
You can leave and go live in a non capitalist country, not too many options though. I mean you're right if you do nothing you will die. You need food to live which require capital.
---
Concerned Ape is an amazing dev!  He's also like Bob Ross levels of wholesome.
---
Incredibly disingenuous. It's entirely up to Blizzard (the billion dollar company) how much they pay their employees.
---
Come on, suggest a solution. How are you going to convince people to work hard and take risks if you aren't going to pay them more for it? 
---
It is known 
---
Respecing in general costing gold is my only true criticism of classic wow.  It‚Äôs silly you have to pay hard earned class-gold just to tinker with your classes talents.  Really dumb. 
---
If you think a $300 million fine on a $5.4 billion acquisition is theft then what do you think of the $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut from 2017?
---
&gt; the people at the top have 20 times what a normal person needs to retire,
---
add about two zeros to that number mate ;)
---
This is the coctent I subbed in for!
---
&gt; as long as the host/creator isn't making profit off it... Shouldn't it be allowed?
---
If people are playing the private server instead of official servers they're still using Blizz's property to hurt their profits.  Doesn't matter if they're making money off it or not.
---
&gt;Hating and killing allies is half the point
---
No it isnt, not for me. I dont give a shit about the horde
---
As paying customers or potential customers people have EVERY right to criticize or in your words ‚Äúrip on them‚Äù it‚Äôs a recent thing where customers are expected to bend over when they provide sub par products and thank them.
---
Buffett famously pays himself only $100,000 per year in actual cash. The only reason Buffett pays such a low rate is because his compensation is almost entirely in the form of capital appreciation since he owns a large chunk of Berkshire Hathaway. Although many executives do actually get rich from capital gains, they are a completely different form of income, the primary difference being that you actually have a decent chance of *losing* that money instead of making it. We have collectively decided as a society in the United States (along with most of the developed world) that we want to reward entrepreneurs and long term investors and therefore tax such risk less harshly. Most economists would argue we should scrap the capital gains tax entirely, but that is neither here nor there.
---
That said, because you made me curious, I took a look at Kotick‚Äôs compensation package. He was paid $28.7 million in fiscal year 2017 (the latest full year of data available), which was comprised of:
---
* $1.75mm salary
---
* $19.55mm restricted stock award
---
* $4.5mm in securities options
---
* $2.8mm in non-equity compensation
---
* $87k in other compensation
---
Restricted stock awards are going to be treated as ordinary income when issued (there are some more complicated forms of RSU‚Äôs but I‚Äôm going to ignore those for now since they have similar tax implications) and therefore will be subject to income taxes. Given he lives in California, he‚Äôs paying a 13.3% tax rate on the vast majority of that income on top of the 37% federal rate he‚Äôs paying, so an **over 50%** tax rate (this is using current tax law which caps SALT deductions at $10k. Prior to the new tax law his rate likely would have been lower since he lives in such a high tax state).
---
Even using the most conservative tax implications for his other forms of income, he is likely paying well over 40% on his 2017 income. His capital gains since the beginning of 2017 have been about 25% on his ownership of about 4.6mm shares, which comes out to $41mm over two years (20mm per year). Assuming he pays a 20% rate on that ‚Äúincome‚Äù, we‚Äôre still looking at a weighted average tax rate of 40% or more (I don‚Äôt want to do our the math on mobile but feel free to do so if you think I‚Äôm wrong).
---
I know very well how the US tax system works and although it‚Äôs not the greatest thing ever, I can assure you Kotick is not paying a 16% rate on his salary. Whether his salary should be that high or not is another argument, however.
---
I am talking about 1.12 macro function. You likely refer to earlier macros when the API was far more open. You can't write scripts in Classic that play the game for you.
---
Don't use fear of writing macros confuse you with complex scripts from early Wow or games like SWG.
---
You don't know me and assume I have "baggage". You are a tool get used to it.
---
fyi this is /r/classicwow and blood elves weren't a playable race in classic so
---
In a perfect world: it goes to whoever it gives the biggest upgrade to. So if the MT is going from T2 -&gt;T2.5, but your OT only has an MC non tier epic in place, then you give the T2.5 to the OT.
---
In the realworld, you're going to have to balance attendance/performance/a bunch of other variables besides how much of an upgrade an item is. But at the same time, people are going to go into raids with a well established BiS list. Your #1 dps mage might only have 3-4 items in an entire raid that are BiS upgrades. 
---
The guild I raided in back in Vanilla and TBC - for a few of the well known "this actually is the BiS item for anyone who can equip it" pieces, you knew before hand who it would go to if dropped. You knew if "Staff of the Shadow Flame" dropped it as going to the #1 dps mage, hell that item was his only bis left and its the only reason he even showed up to BWL anymore. So it can feel kind of shitty when an exciting item like that drops and you never ever had a real chance at it, but at the same time you never complained when Magey was pumping out crazy dps that let us get through Vael, and he didnt need any of the drops. Some things are just the nature of the beast when it comes to 40 man raids, theres giving and taking.
---
People freaking the fuck out in this sub
---
1m players spending the same amount  as 10m is actually more profit as there are less costs involved in supporting the 1m. 
---
&gt; It absolutely is an indicator for skill, performance, ability, etc. It's not a guarantee for either of those, but there is a way higher likelihood of someone with curve knowing the entire raid than someone without.
---
If you cannot distinguish between something bought for gold and something earned through skill, **it is not a good indicator** for skill. That's the exact opposite. It's a double edged sword. 
---
If premise A about the player base leads to conclusion B only 30% of the time, you might be thinking that it's still okay to to accept premise A because *most* of the times it will increase your chances of getting to conclusion B - *HOWEVER* - you're still shooting yourself in the foot excluding players on a false premise. In modern WoW that's not a problem because you can cross-realm and get as many players as you want, but good luck doing that in Classic. 
---
&gt; Like, if we follow this allegory, the equivalent of removing achievements would be to not issue college diplomas, essentially giving college graduates no proof of their education, making it irrelevant when applying for jobs. That doesn't sound very ideal does it?
---
Yes it does because then you, as a raid leader, actually have to use your **skills** to try and determine who can do what based on what that person has equipped, how he's answering questions, what consumables he's bringing etc. 
---
Just like how in an interview (at least in tech, or in jobs worth a fuck in general) they give less of a shit about your credentials and more of a fuck about what you actually know how to do. While having credentials is alright, no one is going to "invite" you in any company without an interview, an exam and an evaluation.
---
If you're an HR hiring on diplomas alone, you're a fucking idiot. 
---
&gt; It just gives us a better approximation of experience
---
No it doesn't, it deceives naive people such as yourself that they reflect experience. If it can be bought at a reasonable price, if you can get carried to get it, then it's not an indicator of experience, skill or anything else. If it can be abused it will be abused.
---
&gt;Keep in mind as well I am trying to speak while vomiting and retching so I am screeching the words in between pukes. I am just crawling across the floor at them hurling and screeching at this point.
---
Sounds like your usual PvP player tbh
---
No one is going to watch a 40min video. 
---
That would be good. There's a pretty large discrepancy with the Priest racials, some being great, some being trash. 
---
Yeah, WoD was absolutely amazing to level alts in. 
---
I agree - The game needs to improve and make changes.
---
Core Hounds was pretty much the only encounter that required any thought outside of your standard spell rotation. I did it with an LFR group of randos on the first day and cleared it without getting anywhere close to a wipe. 
---
you stacked classes but you still brought at least one of most hybrid specs because their personal dps + utility provided outweighed bringing another pure dps.  4 melee + enhance shaman is much more dps than 5 melee, especially considering enhance (and horde ret) were the best performing hybrid specs.
---
shadow priest was absolute shit dps wise by sunwell but they were still present in world first kills because 5% magic dmg debuff, shadow weaving, and mana battery all outweigh the effects of simply bringing another warlock. 
---
I have no idea, but the point was that even while the game was dying and getting a heroic kill was easy as fuck, people still bought it in hundreds. I was only a tiny, tiny fish to the whole system that was running there. And by comparison, we barely could recruit a holy paladin for our mythic progress raid. I don't know, saying it's a "rare" thing - maybe in the first few weeks it might be but not so much in the week 2-3, especially in the latest expansions where heroic bosses were absolute jokes for most players as far as difficulty was concerned. 
---
HAHAHA OMG this is funny.
---
Bears tank dungeons better than warriors in greens and blues ... BY A LONG MILE!
---
could be the same char post race change. no need to be rude
---
That sounds like a good plan. I like the idea of having alts planned out ahead of time too and multiple characters for different people to play with. I did something similar with a warrior and mage recently, but didnt plan ahead. I had the mage as my duo and the warrior as my solo (since she had a warrior too).
---
I ended up not really being able to aoe grind as much as I would have liked because I was keeping the mage same-level as the wife's warrior. We would aoe grind in tandem though with her rounding them up but it definitely wasnt as efficient as pure solo would have been. Next time around I would play something more complementary for sure since I did not plan my alts ahead of time and did them spur of the moment.
---
I don't disagree quality over quantity, but it's tough to agree a developer is similar to blizzard when they have one title.
---
I loved Vanilla, too.
---
Hit 35 in 3 months XD at the age of 10. 
---
I should note that i'm not a mythic raider - I'll dabble in heroics - but mainly just PvP, World PvP, warfronts and hang out with people. 
---
I disagree about easy mode - the game is as hard as you make it. 
---
You can choose to do mythic raiding - or high-end PvP - but most don't - but that doesn't justify your idea of the game being easy.
---
Its the same with sense of community - of-course you are restricted in comparison with Vanilla.
---
But you choose to talk to people - if you choose not to, then you miss out. 
---
I make sure I whisper at least 3-4 random people each play session to develop relationships etc..
---
Simply just by commenting on transmog - or a mount etc... 
---
Daft punk and red bull
---
It's tough because I really want to play all three classes. I am hoping the release schedule is really slow and I have time to flesh everyone out. Definitely check out kargoz duo classes guide on YouTube and it will give you a good idea on what to pick. 
---
No one is forced to work for Blizzard.  
---
&gt;You can leave and go live in a non capitalist country
---
It's not that easy. In order to leave a (capitalist) country you have to make sure that you have enough money to get to where you're going. This would include moving costs, plane ticket, passport, vaccinations (more than likely). Then there's getting a job when you actually get there, if you know the language (assuming you're moving from the US to say, China or Vietnam seeing how there's travel restrictions to Cuba and things of that nature). 
---
&gt;You need food to live which require capital.
---
Sort of. From an economic stand point capital =/= money. Capital is when money is used to make more money, whereas actual money is just used to buy something to consume. I.e, I invest money in a company so that I can make more money (without doing any actual work), that money I invested AND got back would be capital whereas "I used my money to buy a commodity", that's money. 
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7KWykbYNqs) is obviously what happened.  Would break lore to put it back.
---
Great response, all 3 points.
---
For Pro's on the priest in case any future priest-players are reading -- the priest can dispel magic offensively whereas the paladin can not. So they can do things like dispel an enemy mage's Ice Barrier/Innervate/Hots/buffs/whatever. Shamans do this better, but if you are on alliance Priests are the only class with an offensive dispel.
---
The face warping is something that can be found in Illegal Danish/Zinwrath. In fact Illegal Danish also features a deep voices Night Elf. As far as the gnome could that be Dirti G? 
---
Here's the videos I think you are referring to:

Where does this idea that druids weren‚Äôt wanted at end-game raiding in vanilla come from? Every single raid group wanted at least one druid due to Mark of the Wild, and resto druids are very powerful raid healers (and if you don‚Äôt believe that, you can peek some private server logs where every raid uses essentially 1-2+). Innervate, Decurse, thorns, and Battle Rez are also very valuable to have in a raid setting. 
---
I don‚Äôt disagree that class balance was a bit whack in vanilla, especially with regards to how many of each class you bring (1-2 druids vs 3-5 priests), but let‚Äôs not pretend that every class did not have at least one spec that was desired in raids.
---
"some Russian will do the right thing" said no one, ever
---
If you did play vanilla then you would understand the consequences of giving an inch on changes. You are delusional or lying if you see it differently. 
---
Imagine running a billion dollar widget company and announcing No New Widgets will be made or sold this year.
---
Did the CEO get his MBA from Liberty University or wtf?
---
This is honestly pretty fucked up in so many ways.
---
While we cant really tell anything for 100% certainty, I never would've thought that after everything they fucked up so far, they would continue to do the same thing.
---
If there is ingame shop or sharding permanently, I will refuse to play it and hope most of the community do the same thing. There will be better alternatives.
---
Nothing would make me happier, than see a private project do better than the "genuine" thing if they manage to fuck it up.
---
I'd say WoD or late MoP are the worst.
---
MoP having the worst stall at the end - but still my favourite expansion.
---
MoP/Cata were excellent IMO - PvP wise. 
---
No, i think it is popular to hate the game because of Activision's antics. 
---
The game is fine. 
---
Not the best its been - not the worst. 
---
Has some major flaws - but nothing that ruins the game for the normal player. 
---
Good thing they have the original 1.12 client and backend data so they can test it. The only question is whether or not the Activision Blizzard management will let the devs actually take the development time to test it and perform QA and bug fixes.
---
I don't doubt the devs so much, more so I have absolutely no faith in the Activision Blizzard corporate structure.
---
It's not my job to suggest a solution. I'm a cog in a machine built to shovel more money into the gaping, never satiated mouths of the 1%
---
Sick!
---
And this is why the hyper wealthy laugh at you and I both. Because there aren't enough people like me who are unhappy with the extreme wealth disparity and there are too many people who think like you and are okay with being forced fed shit their entire lives 
---
SAMWISE
---
1. The honor system is complete trash. We just got used to it.
---
2. The itemization is complete trash and not well thought (Blizzard admitted this) and is the cause of much of the dps disparity. Class scaling can be mitigated through more intelligently thought out gear progression without touching 1.12 class mechanics. MITIGATED ... NOT balanced. Balance disparity is part of Wow and by design and a good thing because it wasn't built on raiding or arena balance which preserves the elements of Classic that makes it Classic.
---
3. Lack of Horizontal progression. The bulk of the player metrics in original Wow were non-high tier raiders. Much more could have been done to expand the existing world prior to TBC, add more dungeon tiers for off-spec gear sets, add more lore and community based content which would lengthen the Fresh/Old server cycle and increase player retention during progression patch lag.
---
Classic Wow was very much an unfinished game when TBC came out. Blizzard decided to shift to a nearly completely different game with the massive gear stap leap, a new world and major city and near abandonment of the old world. The original Classic design scope itself of basically abandoned as a concept. This is why we are even here posting.
---
Or maybe people just don‚Äôt like it idk idk idk
---
PVP is like 90% of the game to me. Red is dead. 
---
I'm confused. Did you see the word objective and decide to use it without knowing what it meant? Every single example you gave is very clearly subjective...
---
Agreed.  When they came out with achievements, my first and only thought was that their only purpose was to serve as validation tools for people that can't simply enjoy the game on its own merits.  It's the same feeling I get when I see the "achievements unlocked" section in Steam.  I don't need a fucking medal to tell me that I played the game; I know I did, I was *there*.
---
I believe druids can solo a bit of DME as well - my friend told me he could solo 6 packs in DME (compared to priests killing the 4 non elite lasher packs), however I‚Äôm not sure how quickly/efficiently druids do it.
---
That is true. After a certain point at 60 all you had was raids and pvp. A casual guild would raid about twice a week when i was a wee lad. Guilds too small to rais themselves would form unofficial Alliances.
---
Sure you played 5 days a week not raiding; but the raids really were the highlight of the game, and this is coming from a pvper.
---
I think it‚Äôs popular to hate the game because it has the depth of a puddle. It‚Äôs a Skinner box filled with RNG and 0 RPG elements. Little to no customization, watered down classes, terrible azerite system, broken reward system with titanforging, ridiculous timegates, sharded servers that destroy any sense of community, incredibly poor storytelling, no direct communication with developers, and I‚Äôll just stop there i think. But yes the hate is just a trend.
---
Those laid off worked a low paying entry level job, that had nothing to do with developing or balancing the product, didn‚Äôt they?
---
Do you suggest these Customer support employees give major contributions to the succes of the Company? I would think they are all very replaceable
---
And its within his power to change his situation if he doesnt feel Blizzard is treating him fairly
---
Exactly.
---
There is no incentive for acti/blizz to make a better product as long as idiots keep dumping cash into them.
---
Fanboyism is bad for everyone.
---
Honor system being awful is objective fact: rewarded account sharing, unhealthy weekly amount of game time and punishing people for taking holidays. It's borderline unethical to have a system like this.
---
If you don't suggest a solution, do you think the top 1% would? Spoiler, if there was a solution, there wouldn't be such a big gap in wealth disparity. The only way to not have a big wealth gap is by making everyone poor.
---
He‚Äôs the last of my guild that‚Äôs left.
---
Everyone else is long gone too.
---
Our former GM switched to private servers years ago. Spent a bit of time on Nost before the closure, then in others. 
---
He played on one pserver for a long while, then the server admins launched a new and improved one - and the community on the original server drained quickly. He couldn‚Äôt move his char across, so he just gave up and quit too.
---
Shaman are great for organized PvP too, if you ever plan on doing battlegrounds or group world pvp. They have a unique dispel called Purge which is enemy only and strips 2 buffs at once, so you can get someone "naked" really fast. Very satisfying im sure. I only know about it from the alliance side, which freaking SUCKS when the shaman is targeting you haha. Oh im in trouble let me shield... phew, I got some hots from that pr.. what the hell all my buffs are go- oh im dead in a global from windfury too. Lol
---
I‚Äôm so looking forward to Classic.  But if they fuck it up by laying off ANOTHER 8% of their workforce, and CEO Bobbby Dickhead gives himself another $15 million bonus, then I‚Äôm done.  
---
Hasn't happened to me in EVER. Been playing since '05. World blues at best.
---
I agree that retail is still very enjoyable. It had fantastic art and lore, and is friendly to players with less free time. But it‚Äôs not the life-changing experience of old days. 
---
Blood elf isn't vanilla!?
---
The zone.
---
We‚Äôre from Argent Dawn EU.

Can you actually read? Read my previous comment again please.
---
Also 
---
&gt; You are delusional or lying if you see it differently.
---
is really gold. Thank you for such gem.
---
I am talking about the 1.12 API. You can automate rotations with it. And I'm not one of these retards saying that "no changes" is some sort of axiomatic premise for the success of classic. It's fucking bullshit. They've already made changes to the UI and graphics and it doesn't fucking matter because the core gameplay is what actually matters and its still there.
---
Anyways, I'll bet you a million bucks CastSpellByName (and the other cast functions) will be protected. The extent of the automation possible with it was clearly overlooked by Blizzard and there is no way they will intentionally put it back into the game.
---
They need to bring this back to today‚Äôs game..it was so much more fun.
---
It's not a Vanilla flaw, but I wish they never made expansions outside of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, at least not initially. I would have preferred them to flesh out the zones that already existed but were inaccessible (Hyjal for example), add the islands from lore (Legion &amp; BFA ruined them sadly), add the Pandaren Empire - the one that was in Stonetalon Mountains, not the newer MoP change of Pandaria being its own continent, etc.
---
This is largely a "No Change" crowd. 
---
By that I mean Classic being released in a way very, very close to how it played in patch 1.12 in function and design. Players WANT this. Warts and All.
---
Where it goes from there? I have no idea, but currently you are representing the type of player many here feel was complicic to the destruction of the original Wow concept. Just so you know.
---
You appear to be ignoring the reason why Classic is even being made: the success of private server emulation outside of the control of Blizzard. Players WANT 40 man raids and the non-current retail design direction.
---

Well, like I said there are a lot of types of RSU‚Äôs, but largely agreed. I still don‚Äôt think he can do anything to get down to a sub-35% effective rate, even taking deductions into account, which was kinda my original point.
---
I read that in Cthun‚Äôs voice.
---
lol ya. That was annoying on private servers.
---
Ahhh no no, I should have clarified that I know it's not the illegal Danish, but thanks for the help.
---
Who cares what other people have? Are you just jealous other people have more money? Do you get mad when other people save money when you spend it all? Why should society be forced to babysit you? I'm not okay with being forced to eat shit all my life so I went to college and worked hard and got a high paying job. I know not everyone is fortunate to have the opportunity but unless someone suggests a better system, then this is as good as it is going to get.
---
I so torn between Mage to try something new or go for the nostalgia, a resto druid. But man is the teleport spells and easier end game farming enticing
---
Thanks for the tip, havent heard of him :)
---
I too hope the schedule is slow as molasses with the idea of permanence in mind. I made another post about that recently not sure if it was this thread.. but that would be so cool if they kept the servers up as long as the company stayed open. Even if they eventually have to merge them all down to 1 single server with only a few hundred online at a time, there would always be enough of a market to "keep the lights on" for sure. And population could wax and wane with new expansions and new generations of gamers coming and going. Maybe even eventually 1 permanent server per Expansion too, for people whose favorite xpac are TBC, WOTLK, etc
---
Well...technically WoW Classic isn‚Äôt new.
---
I don't know, I like BE male DK the most for example. Plate armor looks kinda cool on them.
---
Mail, leather or cloth armor on the other hand...
---
I don't think Blizz will ever release a big game again. It's going to be smaller projects that generate revenue mainly through micro-transactions and subscriptions. I think we'll see WoW Mobile before we seen another new MMO from them again. Warcraft 4? Lol
---
Do you realize you can race change, right? I changed my undead rogue, character created during vanilla, to nightborne at the end of Legion just to change things a little bit.
---
LOL yikes.  I just farmed for it on a pserver recently and had it within 20 minutes I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  Not sure if they buffed the drop rate or just got astoundingly lucky
---
Any existing automation (I suspect we define this differently) or sequential raid rotation scripting (pounding on 1 button repeatedly) has nothing to do with the macros I talk about and nearly every player uses/used in Classic or private servers.
---
These are just basic macros. Some are required to play certain classes properly. I fully expect a protected API, but the 1.12 macros I talk about don't risk game play in any way.
---
What's your point?
---
No, by definition it can't be objective. Some people like the vanilla honor system. I know the vast majority don't, but that's irrelevant. 
---
Correct. Classic is not a front runner game.
---
The project has nothing to do with the current layoffs and restructuring ... until we hear confirmation otherwise.
---
Yeah some of priest's biggest advantages over paladin are:
---
1. Dispel magic. Can't be understated how good being able to purge the best buffs in the game is, especially in premade v premade environments where free action potions are used constantly. And while priests have a different niche on horde since shaman can purge too it's worth keeping in mind that some of the best buffs to dispel (blessing of freedom, protection, and sacrifice) come from paladins, so horde need purges more than alliance.
---
2. Mana burn. I legitimately hate priests on my paladin and feast on their tears as a priest, because if I can't line of sight them they hard counter me by burning all my mana away, which is one of the few times as a paladin that I really want support from classes with interrupts. And that's in addition to being able to dispel my best blessings.
---
3. Two useful spell schools. Holy paladins are pretty much useless whenever they get spell locked, but priest can swap to mana burning or tossing mind blast and shadow word pains.
---
If you hate capitalism, go to Venezuela, I heard it's wonderful socialist paradise. 
---
Hmmmm. I'll keep looking. Did you try the warcraftmovies website?

---
I haven't played retail since Cata when they did a major overhaul and even back then, the consensus seemed to be that they revamped the levelling zone to be way more dynamic/story-focused, with phasing/etc. to allow your actions to actually reflect in the world at large. 
---
It's not really an outlandish claim to say they've been improving on their storytelling. Can you specify what is "telling" about someone enjoying a more polished, comprehensive experience? 
---
Remember, I'm no retail fanboy. Haven't played since 2010. Just saying, this sounds like a bandwagon "DAE" comment to me. 
---
Exactly dude. Diablo 2 was one of my first games I've ever played and the game that's easily in my top 3 games of all time. 
---
Diablo Immortal announcement was something that made me so sad and what has made me to hate Blizzard so much.
---
Absolutely agree :)
---
For the average player it is enjoyable to log on and destroy some noobs in the World - or in BGs.
---
The raiding tier is very good IMO.
---
But you're right - it does seem like everything from MoP and Before seems like much better gaming.
---
I do, of course, prefer previous expansions (and vanilla) - Just stating that it is still enjoyable.
---
Rotations for some classes are pretty much non-existent, two-button that can be macro'd to one. The debuff limit will cut that down for certain specs and players even further in end game. 
---
             
---
I'm not saying everyone should have 4 button glowy reaction rotations like in retail, I'm just saying playing a holy warrior should be more fun than what Ret is, regardless of the DPS output. 
---
My point is obvious.  What's your point?  Blizzard is a company and they can pay their employees peanuts if they want to, and good employees can choose whether or not to work for Blizzard.  Companies pay employees based on their value to the company.
---
I would debate many of those points (Not all).
---
The one I most disagree with is the communication.
---
I feel as though they've upped communication with Ion personally writing in forums and answering questions - along with hold regular Q&amp;As and the Blizzcon panels.
---
I don't they are deserving of lack of communication criticism. 
---
Thank you! Was going for the Noth The Plaguebringer style.
---
I loved it then I didn't play for two expansions so it's impossible to catch up and I hate them. Went from farming them in wrath to not even opening the cheeve page in legion.
---
What country do you live in with these wonderful worker protections? Cause in the US it's right to work which means they can fire your ass for any reason and rehire a monkey to do your job for half the price.
---
You're probably right. I wouldn't be surprised if it the average was mid 20's though.  
---
Of course it was the alcohol thats what makes it funny. It's just kismit I was talking pve servers.
---
I did it recently on a server who's name shall not be mentioned, but it does generally have quite low drop rates for quest items... got it on the first whelp.
---
The Q&amp;A‚Äôs are laughable. Filled with empty promises (8.1 class reworks) and lawyer speak. Lots of ‚Äúwe hear you‚Äù with no action. Lore nodding along and assuring the viewer that what Ion is saying makes perfect sense! 
---
They just laid off pretty much their entire community engagement team. Their best CM‚Äôs are gone. Don‚Äôt pretend like they give a fuck about communicating with you anymore.
---
Man, so much of what you end up playing in end game depends on the social group you are in ... namely the guild. I've tried to go feral dps in some guilds and had no luck. In other's I was considered the front runner and had no issues playing feral in raids because they knew I good I was.
---
That's pretty much the life of a hybrid but I see similar issues with warriors. Guilds only require a few good and dedicated tanks yet warriors are everywhere so competing as dps becomes nearly as frustrating as hybrids trying to play offspecs.
---
The funny thing is, this is part of Classic's appeal as much as it's annoyance so we must live with the meta.
---
Typical no brained response. Just because I think capitalism is garbage doesn't mean I advocate for socialism. Go back to foxnews the grown ups are talking.
---
Their most recent call of duty release was wildly successful.  They had that plus a wow expansion release (lots of upfront cash) which helped them a lot last year.
---
Warrior. Obviously.
---
You're willing to tank and commit to multiple days per week of raiding. No other combination that you listed will guarantee you attendance/progression.
---
Always need tanks.
---
Yeah! Let's try Socialism! What could go wrong??? 
---
If it's that easy, why can't you get the job? Is your golf game that bad?
---
Most things that would require an "if / then" statement probably won't work (which is honestly a good thing, trust me on this‚Äîyou can make *way* too powerful macros and addons otherwise), that being said, there are ways around that. Try this for example:
---
-You are in bear form. 
---
-You make a macro and use the the moonfire icon for it. 
---
-Under the Macro, you say /cast shapeshift (or whatever to go back to normal form, you might even be able to do something like '/cancelaura bear form', which would be preferable)
---
-In your normal form, you place moonfire at the same location that it is in your bear form and you hit it again., and it casts moonfire. Perfect.
---
So it will take 2 clicks in order to cast moonfire, but you basically just hit the button until it casts (chances are you will be used to spamming keys anyway, you wont even notice). This is how I've always stance / danced with a warrior. Its very fun and fast and effective, as you never actually have to hard cast your different stances.
---
-If you can make a macro like '/cancelaura bear form', you will be able to use that same macro in both forms, because the macro will look like this 
---
(/cancelaura bear form
---
 /cast moonfire)
---
And thats ideal because you just use that same macro (or similar one, depending on what form you are exiting) in all your forms, putting it in the same location in every form, and it will always pull you to your normal form, and when you try to cast it in your normal form, it has no form to cancel. But at that point you just throw moonfire on your bar.
---
Yes. I‚Äôm a strong no-sharding kind of player. 
---
It should also be noted that me and my friend met on a few other other occasions after that first time - it‚Äôs the kind of thing that happens when servers aren‚Äôt merged with the entire WoW player base. We recognised each other easily and started chatting, and inviting none another to dungeons and such. 
---
Someone here said it wisely: you‚Äôre more likely to make friends with people you work with than those on the bus to the office, because that‚Äôs an environment that breeds regular interaction 
---
Think of it like this: As far as the investors and non-gamer execs are concerned Classic is just another server type for WoW.   They aren't going to kill WoW anytime soon, so this is a good thing.
---
Oh man. I forgot all about mana burn. That reminds me of the early meta shifts in TBC when arenas got popular and started turning into battles of attrition for who can last the longest without going oom. Great post! 
---
I hated consumables. The raids were already time consuming and now you want me to go farm for some flask. No thanks. I was gold poor and the raids took up most of my playing time in vanilla as it was. I wanted to PvP in my offtime, not go farm some mobs.
---
Paying someone $11 an hour is paying them the bare minimum required by law. A multi-billion dollar company chooses to do this. And you're trying to make it seem admirable. That's gaslighting
---
" eventually it will get stale"
---
Yet Private Vanilla servers have been occupied since retail Vanilla moved to BC and on.
---
Yep. He just switched mains since our first meet, was a warrior back then. 
---
&gt; Given that this is a game, the amount of time you have dedicated to playing is perfectly good metric and often a direct correlation to how much you have seen of the content and how many secretes you have unlocked.
---
Time spent has never been a good metric because it consistently ignores every other potential factor. To demonstrate, a question for you. Which of these two people should be better rewarded?:
---
* Player A who spends 200 hours just killing critters
---
* Player B who spends 10 hours raiding, and 10 hours PvPing
---
I think most of us would agree, player B deserves better rewards despite playing for 1/10 of the time as A. Why? The content B did was more difficult and required more skill. Now if we had a player C who did 100 hours each of raiding and PvP they do deserve to be rewarded better than both of those, but that's because of a combination of quality and quantity. If they instead did 10 hours of raiding and 10 hours of PvP then 180 hours of critter killing they don't deserve to be rewarded more than B.
---
That's not even taking into account skill levels. The higher the skill level of a player, the more efficient they'll be. If B and C both spend 10 hours raiding, but B only clears 1 boss while C clears the whole raid, C should be rewarded more.
---
&gt; You logged in, you put in the time, you came out with something better than the person who did not do the PvP grind, the 3X a week raids, or grind of mobs/hand ins for the special mount/title.
---
I fail to see how any of this is no longer true about retail WoW. If you log in, put in the time to grind out rated PvP (and are skilled enough) you get exclusive mounts and titles. If you put in the time and grind out the Mythic raid you get exclusive mounts and titles. If you put in the time to grind island expeditions, or warfront rares, or pet battles you get exclusive things to show off.
---
&gt; Modern WoW has taken much of this away because time and effort no longer offers an advantage.
---
I dare you to tell Method that. Go on, tell them the extra time they put in offered them no advantage.
---
&gt; There is not a way to distinguish yourself from players who do not put the same level of effort into the game that you do, which negates the pleasure derived from doing those activities. No one really enjoys endless grinding, but they do get a sort of high from completing that goal and getting a unique item, and knowing that only people who went through that grind will have that item.
---
So all those rewards I literally linked to with various exclusive rewards don't mean anything? Like I don't understand how you can look at literally piles of rare rewards and say "those don't exist".
---
Lotta words. Still **WRONG**.
---
The cinematography you mention fails to cover the basic flaws that these goddamn expansion and "improvements" introduce. Storytelling? lol. WoW's story has been shot, buried, dug up, reanimated and then shot and buried again.
---
It's a philosophical point.  If the point of classic is to recreate literally every detail of JUST 1.12, then logically the second moon should be missing with no explanation (it was missing for literally years for absolutely no reason), just as it was when they removed it in 1.10 for no understood reason.  However, it was there for most of vanilla, and was never intended to be gone, and it didn't effect play.  
---
Regardless, I think we get the answer via what technical method is used to build it.  If you are using the modern client with changes ported in, it's easier to leave the moon there.  If you are using a 1.12 client specifically, it's almost impossible to add the moon back.
---
I understand why people with little to no money are upset but I fail to see a solution that would actually benefit anyone. Why would you work harder or take on more risk if you weren't going to get more compensation for it? Because if I'm going to make just as much money as someone flipping burgers, why would I work 100 hrs/week or risk starting a business?
---
Literally a stickied thread for this on Wednesdays. Might want to copy paste this over there before it gets removed
---
I‚Äôm experimenting with vanilla shaman atm (I only started playing shammy on live servers in wotlk) and they no joke fill up nearly every action bar between PvP and pve play, because of having to bind food for quick PvP drinking, and down ranked spells for pve grinding/healing
---
Activision laid of the staff as a system wide debacle. Don't insinuate it is Ion Hazzikostas. 
---
Don't insinuate it is the guy who was friends with Caden. Yes, I know who you're talking about.
---
It is not blizzard. 
---
There are still plenty of CMs at Blizzard.
---
It's truly unfortunate they've laid off some of the best ones. 
---
I think you miss the purpose of a Q&amp;A - it is to establish an understanding about the mindset of the director /Developers of WoW.
---
I've never once heard them make a promise in a Q&amp;A. 
---
The times they've stated they'd fix a bug - you can clearly follow BlizzardDevs on Twitter and you'll see it to be confirmed as fixed. 
---
Q&amp;A is not content release. 
---
I post this and mods removed it lol. But if someone else posts it, it‚Äôs alllllll gooooood.
---
However, you're just speaking for yourself. I, and everyone I know (again, anecdotally), distinguish between these terms.
---
Kinda baffled they won't call WC3 Reforged a frontline release.
---
Oh I see, you‚Äôre one of those people that doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that there is no longer a divide between Activision and Blizzard. They are 100% complicit in this. They don‚Äôt get a pass.
---
I get buffed all the time even at low low levels, and I've only ever played Horde.
---
Oh didnt realize I will try to do that
---
You mean him personally? Or Retail Wow in general since 2010?
---
If so thats super sad.. I always loved how cool they were and the joking attitudes. You could tell they were players too and loved what they were doing with the RP style they would handle tickets with :(
---
 Shame if thats completely gone now for 8 years.. shows how long ive been gone too though haha
---
&gt; You need to git gud to succeed on horde
---
Surely that will cause some faction imbalance when it comes to raiding guilds choosing which faction they'll choose? It's natural to choose the path to least resistance. 
---
Cinematography isn't meant to cover anything up.
---
It is designed to highlight certain aspects of a story and create a meaningful image that relates to said story.
---
I love the very simplistic shotgun effect you use. 
---
You have no real specific complaints - so you just shoot in any direction - calling anything dead or dying.
---
That is a distinctive feature of a bandwagon'er.
---
I played a tiny bit of vanilla but mostly started in late tbc/wotlk and mained several classes in retail: warrior, druid, rogue, monk, and priest across the various expansions.
---
What class in general offers the most utility? I enjoy playing support in most games, and I'll probably need to heal since I'm going to be playing with a group of friends so I know that limits my choice to druid, shaman, priest, or paladin. But I'm also open to considering things like a warlock or rogue if my buddies fall through and quit after a week and I end up playing solo.
---
I'm partial to having faster movement speed so ghost wolf/travel form are things that are really appealing to me so I can fast herb/mine and just generally get around more efficiently. But at the end of the day I'd like a class that I can have one spec since there probably won't be dual spec/ cheap spec changes.
---
TL;DR 
---
what healer class offers the most utility and has specs that allow for healing in dungeons while also being able to solo content otherwise.
---
Additional question: are there any potions/spells/engineering items/trinkets/craftables/random world drops that increase movement speed similar to aspect of cheetah/ghost wofl/cat form ms talent?
---
Green Tower for me. Think i got like 40g... Technically I also got an epic gun i sold for 60g in Sunken Temple on a private server.
---
If you take a job with a major company for minimum (state) wage, you have the least amount of value possible in the workforce of said company.  If, 10 years later, you still hold the same position for the same pay, you have very effectively demonstrated you are not any more valuable than when you started.  When cuts need to be made, guess who gets cut? 
---
Also, do our comments appear in the thread anymore for you?  My first one does, and so does yours, but have the mods nixed the rest of our comments from the discussion? 
---
You need to find a good tank or tanks that know how to manage each fight, but also you will need good healers in order for the tank to truly shine.  Doing high dps is only possible if a tank can hold aggro right? well in order for a tank to do that he needs to use less defensive gear and more offensive gear for 2 reasons, more damage in general and he takes more damage for more rage.  A good tank will need to be able to find the sweet spot in each fight where he doesn't die but at the same time takes more damage for more rage and threat.  
---
So to answer your question about managing threat on horde, play with good tanks and good healers, and trust me there are not that many out there.  Even on private servers, the majority of tanks do not understand this
---
I won't cause one -- it already exists.
---
PvE is universally accepted to be easier as alliance -- paladins are meant to be easy to play with a low skill floor and give incredibly powerful buffs to all classes.  
---
Pair that with more generic tolkien races and their proximity to BRM, its obvious to see why PvE and RP servers in Vanilla were totally dominated by the Alliance.
---
Only in PvP servers were factions even remotely balanced, and even then there were exceptions, with few servers populations being overwhelmingly horde.
---
Back in 2004/5, many more mature players looking for a challenge purposely rolled horde (i.e Nihilum  and other "hardcore" guilds from everquest), but the vast majority of players were Alliance.
---
All publicly owned companies are basically shit companies 
---
Yeah, raids would always have at least 1 druid, for sure. But it almost feels wasteful having more than 1. And I say that as a druid atm. It's not that their *useless*, it's that they went from being weak to excellent in BC, to the point where, ideally you would have 1/40 in Vanilla, and maybe 3/25 in Burning Crusade.
---
I'm not arguing that they aren't a necessary piece of the puzzle, or that people shouldn't play druids, I'm just arguing that BC made them *good* rather than subpar.
---
Scorching. I hope these rumblings are all part of the path towards a more sustainable and equitable future in game development. 
---
So wrong on so many levels
---
I‚Äôm not advocating for changes at all (I probably won‚Äôt play classic anyway because of all the drama @ blizz right now with gm/sharding/etc already potentially changing the dynamics of the game too much)
---
What I was trying to articulate was, in another universe, if 1.12 wasn‚Äôt replaced with 2.0 but some hypothetical 1.13, most of the common objections to vanilla could be addressed through itemization.
---
Blizzard already started to tinker with itemization in vanilla, with the shaman tier .5 set being a good example.
---
After realizing shamans functioned better with spell damage and mp5 gear, the poorly itemized tier 0 set could be upgraded to better facilitate the viability of the class.
---
Pally tank mana issues could have been addressed by set bonuses (ala the class passive they received in tbc) and various other fundamental flaws could have been addressed as well.
---
Sadly we will never know, because 2.0 established the pattern of just reworking the game every few years.
---
I doubt that. If they could have easily found better paying work I suspect they‚Äôd have left on their own some time ago.
---
Considering Activision execs are the ones benefitting off this - and not Ion or the development team - I think it is fair to say that the Blizzard company culture is very much against this move. 
---
I don't think there was ever a divide between them - There's certainly a divide between Blizzard Employees and their company, now. 
---
Spam flash of light on your tank for 2 hours straight.
---
Don't get out of position and die to stupid stuff.
---
Honestly, there is very little difference in Naxx for paladins compared to any other raid. Just learn the boss mechanic and spam FoL
---
Very true! Apologies if I misunderstood what you were trying to say. They definitely got a massive upgrade going from vanilla to TBC.
---
I use EA when kiting in PVE too. For example ZG crocks have tendon-rip and EA is occasionally the difference between a mistake being lethal and a mistake being inconvenient.
---
The fuck they don‚Äôt owe them jobs. If they‚Äôre raking in record profits and doling out $15 million sign on bonuses to a single person, they owe it to these low level employees to keep them on.
---
You can walk up to a random job site and tote boards for more then $11/hr. 
---
There are plenty of companies that offer benefits, pay more, and treat their employees better.  
---
They didn't leave before because the had loved the blizzard brand of game growing up, but now with Activision influence, I doubt anyone is fond of blizzard anymore.
---
Because they're throwing tens of millions at executives. But if they fire a enough folks making tens of thousands a year they can realize that profit yet!
---
Old Dell XPS. i still have it, even though it's falling apart XD
---
/roll
---
Wouldn't it be better for the sake of the game that Blizzard addresses this issue and finds a solution?
---
rogue rotation is quite intense, if you going for the minmax and doing it perfectly. probably second after the hunter in the game (if we won't consider feral dps). warrior rotation is much more primitive. so dunno wtf you are talking about. 
---
It's also even harder when you factor in the "revolving door" those last few spots in a 40 man raid. With 40 spots its practically guaranteed that the last 5-10 spots will always be in flux with people quitting or not showing up for certain raids etc. Even if someone has 90% attendance that still means they are missing some raids here and there and a few people will be in and out... Imagine what happens when the Mage from the example above by /u/HearshotKDS with Staff of the Shadow flame has that mage not show up on a random tuesday when it finally drops lol...
---
Like I said, I don't think that layoffs will ensure these things will happen. In fact, they seem pretty disconnected to me. Layoffs |= LFD in Classic.
---
But I'm also don't think that there's any true guarantee that Blizzard wouldn't add unwanted and unneeded "features" to classic WoW. 
---
This isn't that one is causing the other. This is a cautionary statement about saying "never."
---
&gt; It was supposed to create jobs. 
---
AND allow companies to pay their employees more (starts laughing so I don't cry). 
---
You need to understand that sometimes reality don't have anything to do with empathy. Sometimes job is just a job that you lose &amp; you need to find another one. It's not like this is first time happening to a person in this planet. 
---
Anywhere from 3-4 weeks to auto completion. Auto completion means more scarab lords but more resets 'lost' but I think we'll see a lot of guilds push for it this time around. 
---
It won't even remotely resemble pserver speed for a few reasons. First, the average private server player is more knowledgable than the average classic player will be. More importantly, you can't just make multiple dummy accounts to create extra storage space of thousands of stacks of cloth and other trade-in materials. That alone pretty much cripples a servers ability to horde materials beforehand. 
---
It's naive to think there is a better system. Many have tried to come up with something better, and they failed. Corporations need to be reigned in a bit for example Facebook's spying and Car/Electronics manufactures "planned failure" to increase profits but overall Capitalism is the best system we have. 
---
Even in Star Trek where you could make things out of thin air with energy and minerals, there were still grunts working the mines. 
---
I feel for him I do, but at the same time, fuck working 10+ years for 9-11$, at that time it's time to drop the passion project and get in a factory.
---
Still though, I feel for him. They should have been paid better wages and not been laid off. Nobody needs to make 27mil a year. Nobody.
---
&gt; Are you arguing for massive stat differences that would make gnomes garbage melee classes. 
---
I could see gnome tanks having crap stamina but high dodge. Tiny targets *are* harder to hit. Similarly they could have less melee attack power but more haste. They don't hit hard but they hit fast.
---
&gt; Should we have massive differences in speed because taurens have a much larger stride than gnomes.
---
One of the ideas I had a while back for gnomes was for them to have a lower base movement speed but benefit far more from effects that improve movement speed. Slap some rockets boots on a Tauren, they won't do much against that much mass. But those same boots on a *gnome*? That gnome's tiny mass will mean he gets sent flying. I like this ideas like this because they really changes how each race thinks and values different items or effects. A gnome may prefer armor that boosts dodge and abilities that boost movement speed while other classes may prefer entirely different items. So to answer your question, I would be fine with speed differences between races as long as it's done is a smart way, just like I'm fine with differences between classes as long as they're done in a smart way.
---
&gt; The reason why you're wrong is racial stratification. You see this in ESO where people pick the optimal race for whatever their role is. If you're a healer then is no choice but Argonian because they have a massive healing advantage. All you're doing is removing choice and character expression.
---
People will choose the best option regardless of what the option is. If warriors make the best tanks then people who want to tank will play warriors. If Engineering is the profession that provides the most dps then players who want to maximize their dps will learn Engineering. The solution to stratification isn't the removal of variance. The solution is *balance*. Don't make all tanks identical. Buff the weaker tanks to make them better in their own way. Don't make all professions have no effect on your dps. Make each one special in its own way.
---
And removing character expression? Personally I express my character through what he does and how he plays, not just how he looks. Having more ways to make my character play in a unique way means I have more ways to express my character.
---
Ya but, raiding is just one aspect of the game and viable (as it is usually defined on this sub) implies  optimal.
---
Basically what people are assuming is that if a class isn‚Äôt ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù in a role in a specific situation (raiding) the community will deem it non-‚Äúviable‚Äù because only optimal classes will be allowed to do the thing in question (raiding)
---
The assumption that every guild will min/max so hard that they only take ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù specs is probably not a huge exaggeration, but an exaggeration none the less.
---
And, assuming raiding ‚Äúviability‚Äù as defined is a significant issue is also flawed.
---
Also tbc didn‚Äôt have as many ‚Äúhero moments‚Äù as vanilla did (where a random niche spec can really shine based on the situationally)
---
So I would argue it was a double edged sword.
---
We had a similar situation and gave it to the hunter. He didn't have Ashjre'thul yet. Quest bow upgrade is way more impactful, than some stats for rogues/warriors. And everyone agreed. No drama.
---
First and most important thing . . NEVER join a loot council guild, unless you get in early and become an officer then take all the loot like all the officers in those shitty guilds. 
---
DKP is the only way, I know this from experience, unless you like being in guilds with constant drama and always on the verge of breaking up. 
---
&gt;The answer is, of course, high taxes on corporations so we can provide a basic living standard to everyone else not benefitting from the rigged game of Monopoly we're all showing up to too late, but that won't happen until we all stop fighting each other down at the bottom of the barrel
---
Kind of, what you're describing Keynesian economics or perhaps even a social democracy (capitalism with big welfare nets). In reality though, each and every welfare system meant to help the "little guy" will be subject to attack by the people with power (money) so long as they exist, so even if a country is able to set up things like social welfare nets to help people when they're down, it's only a matter of time before they're undone. 
---
The only way to prevent this from happening, or rather to fight properly, is to move to a new type of political economy. 
---
Well that‚Äôs funny considering most companies have been making shittier and shittier products as time has progressed. 
---
Golden Era of WoW was During BWL/PvP updated rewards/ZG
---
AQ added a little extra but for hte most part the gear didn't change radically.  Naxx was pretty busted in ALL regards.  The best rogue hemo mace in the game just drops from trash, same for the BY A HUGE MARGIN feral armor.  You don't even need to kill bosses, just clear trash for a while and you have some of the best gear in the game.
---
Shit was busted.
---
I‚Äôm not sure you know what voluntary means
---
I think you need to understand that the world is a shitty place, with shitty people. If someone came up to you and said "I just got laid off" I don't think you'd respond with "Find a new one and get over it".
---
Like what are you trying to accomplish right now? Obviously, Ythisens isn't the first one to ever get laid off, everyone knows this. But people, including me, liked him and are sad to see him let go.
---
This subreddit never fails to make me cringe 
---
No serious, why would the higher this guy, if you are just as good for a fraction of the price?
---
Which of these ten opinions is your actual main reason?
---
If you nerf the only thing paladins are good at (being a heal bot) alliance is now at a huge disadvantage.
---
If you buff shamans in ANY regard, now they are busted in PvP.
---
Its not an easy task to *just address* these issues.  Even then, that is not the point of Classic.  Its just restoring the game to what it was, not improve it.  Even still, I have zero faith Neo-Blizzard's abilities to not fuck up anything they intentionally change, gameplay-wise.
---
You're forgetting other reason for pally existence. Glorious pally buffs.
---
God this guy is pointing out the flaws in my logic, instead of trying to explain my side, I better just downvote...
---
Some people can't even fathom there may be shortcomings in Vanilla. It's not worth your time to try and explain.
---
It's simple. The tanks, GM, the GM's spouse, and the officers get loot first.
---
Be a real man, and roll as a Shaman on a PvP server.
---
Be your inner lightning god, and be constantly in demand for PvE as a healer.
---
There's good and bad with leaving the private server community behind come Classic. It's somewhat of a double edged sword. I'll missing raiding with the eastern Europeans during NA daytime hours but I won't miss farming spots being occupied round the clock. 
---
No worries! What I love about TBC is it made some specs even *less* homogenous than Vanilla, if you can believe it. Like, Resto Druids... in Vanilla, most of the time they use Healing Touch, their chunky heal, which you could argue many healers used as well. Whereas in TBC, they had an ultra wide (5?) array of healing spells that all had their own purpose, and a shapeshift form that slowed your movement speed. 
---
lip and you can get salv on horde.
---
How many players will have their experience materially affected by the race chosen by other players in their group?
---
I mean, for raiding, I guess it's _possible_ that world record speed runs will require very specific tuning of racials. Elite PvP guilds that are prestigious enough to get to choose from the best players might also benefit from being picky about race.
---
So... I can imagine there will be a fraction of a fraction of a percent of players that will have good reason to be picky about the races chosen by their teammates. But I'm going to bet their numbers will be quite small compared to the horde of tryhard geeks trying to posture themselves as the most knowledgeable within their group.
---
Not only does this thread exist already, it's wrong.
---
The lay offs are to higher more developers.  Classic is also attached to the retail sub.
---

I remember getting the cloth headpiece in the end of gnomer.  It had a cool animation where lighting shot down upon your head. I kept it in my bank forever even though I was a hunter, cool to throw for dramatic effect now and then. You really did wear your achievements.
---
I respect your opinion, but still disagree. I doubt that we could ever reach a common ground on this particular issue. I used to spend hours a day in school doodling characters, theorycrafting racial's and gear and just being excited about what sort of numerical advantage I could get over X class that I disliked at the time. I can fully appreciate that if you are more into the RP aspect of the game that it could be detrimental to your experience if you have to play as another race. 
---
But as they say, different strokes for different folks. I definitely wouldn't consider it an objective flaw though considering many of us find it as a core selling point of the game.
---
Part of the older design philosophy would be that raids would eventually becoming trivialized through gear, but would still be kinda necessary to gear up.  There were a lot of reasons why this would never work, but that seemed to be the underlying assumption of a lot of the vanilla development.  
---
Once the BC philosophy was in place, and it was obvious that new players were not going to have to run through some oddly expanding series of raids to become relevant in the end game, with a complete gear reset each expansion, how they made raids changed, and they went through a lot of effort to be able to make baby versions of the raids available to anyone (through LFR), leading to the eventual world of four raid difficulties we see on live today.  
---
But when Nax was being designed, I bet that the idea was that every player would eventually see nax- either at level 60, where it was really hard and required extensive gearing, or at level 70, where it would presumably be much easier, but still required to get to the end game level 70 raids.  It sounds silly now, sure, but they weren't actually making it for some tiny fraction of a percent, at least in their heads at the time.
---
Well at least we know why you don't get paid the big bucks lol
---
By definition of what? I stated you fact: unhealthy amount of weekly playtime, rewarding account sharing when it's against TOS and punishing people for not playing game for week. 
---
Unless you're just trying to make philosophical statement that everything is subjective in life and it's not because a game encourage you to ruin your health that it can be called a flaw, you have the fact you asked for.
---
Like what are you trying to accomplish? Being sad because some company cuts the fat? And yes, that is exactly what i have said to friends if they lost their job: find a new one because you can do it. Because finding a new Job actually helps to bring the food on the table, being sad doesn't. There is nothing wrong with being a realist. 
---
I loved those battles of attrition. Was disappointed when wrath came out and PvP got a lot burstier. I played arms warrior and mainly with holy paladin partners in 2s and 3s. Very defensive comp, really liked it. Although going up against mirror matchups was really boring, 20+ minute battles of attrition with no chance of killing the other team before their paladin OOMs. We always won those though, because my partner had a trinket from PvE equipped that restored a lot of mana.
---
Based off your list (Druid/shaman/pally) I assume you‚Äôre going to play horde so I‚Äôll leave out pallies (mainly bc ive never played a paladin).
---
As far as healers with utility go - I would typically say shaman. Totems (from windfury to cleansing) are extremely valuable, alongside wipe protection with Ahnk. They can either heal tanks or be more of a raid healer depending on the fights, and they also do decent dps as far as healers are concerned. In my experience, most 5 mans prefer shammies over priests/druids as windfury can significantly increase the speed of run. They‚Äôre also optimal for DME 2 man jump runs through their totems and higher dps (easy way to farm herbs/thorium/enchanting mats).
---
Druids also bring a lot to the table with innervate, thorns (every tank wants thorns in raids and will spam until they get it), and combat Rez. They can be very strong healers, but one of their main drawbacks is how slow they are in solo content (this is what I have been told, as I haven‚Äôt played a Druid in a long time). But, they have the added bonus of stealth if you play on a pvp server (not to mention the ability to flex into a tank/dps for stuff if needed - a resto Druid that turns into bear and taunts a mob running down a priest is always hailed as a hero). They are also very good for leveling though, with cat form sprint and travel from to move around quickly.
---
I personally don‚Äôt rank priests that high as far as utility goes. Their main utility is Dispel (only horde class with magic dispel for friendly targets) and MC - which is very situational (used in ZG spider boss trash). However, they can also play disc and then they get to be treated as a god by mages/warlocks/boomkins who want Power Infusion.
---
With regards to increased movement speed, there are a few pots - swiftness potion (~15s duration a believe) and the Zanza‚Äôs swiftness potion (but that comes out with ZG and requires honored with Zandalari to obtain). There‚Äôs the goblin rocket boots you can use for a speed boost, and the minor run speed enchant as well (I‚Äôm probably forgetting a few).
---
Debuff limit, completely a technical limitation that hobbles the intended gameplay. 
---
Yes I‚Äôm trying to accomplish being sad lol
---
Not shit to play, Blizzard has made outstandingly excellent games in the past. Hearthstone and Overwatch are still very good, and wow is still good for some people. The fact that they make such great games is what makes their corporate decisions so upsetting
---
They had a great reason for removing the code, probably- it's very likely that it relied on assumptions that were not true as the code base moved forward, as it changed internally pretty heavily.  There was, as a result, no requirement to modernize and maintain the unused code.  
---
What they didn't have a good reason for *was removing the ability at fucking all*.  If they had never made that call, they would have fixed the ability when the underlying code changed, and it would never have been an issue in the first place.  
---
&gt; These days we just get ilvl 400 legs, ilvl 400 weapons, etc.  
---
The funniest part to me is, they've squished stats and they've squished item levels, so ilvl is totally meaningless to me.  I can view my end-of-MoP character in armory, still in item level whatever was current gear, with vastly more stats than exist on live.  Because I haven't followed it, the numbers are meaningless to me.  Pre-WoD, everything was still using the same formula, now it's a variety of different games mashed together.  Can't a mob be level 104 to one player and level 107 to another player, *at the same time*?  Wasn't there some drama about players who would keep lower level alts because they were *more powerful* at clearing certain content, and could be used to power level friends in ways that a max level character could not?
---
&gt;Ya but,
---
You should have just stopped there. We agree that class balance can be better, without class homogenization. I'm simply pointing out classic class balance was bad. If you want to argue it's a good thing classes are imbalanced, I will strongly disagree, and am not going to argue that. 
---
Hunter gets priority in any bow or gun.
---
Yep, we had our one survival hunter, one shadow priest, and put arms war and enhance shammy in the rogue group. Oddly ret paladin (horde) was always second on dps on our kaelthas kills. That legendary weapon turned him into a dps machine in the second half.
---
Still so unsure what to play (PvE). 
---
For context, I've been playing only Warlock in my life (little in vanilla, then some in TBC, later raided some in WotLK and WoD), and while I really love thematics and gear aesthetic (the tier sets being delicious), I don't think I can really handle the endgame of warlocks - soul shards, shadow bolting my brains out.
---
I've played FFXIV quite a lot, and been enjoying healing, but the healing is very different. FFXIV healers are very powerful and can just DPS when not healing (and optimizing when to heal, etc.) 
---
My intention is to do 5/10 mans and raid kinda casually. I'd like the class to be engaging, so I can try to get good at it. 
---
Maybe little PvP, but I have not ever been too keen into MMO PvP.
---
Alliance for now, but kinda depends if any pals are playing. I just like the cities more, for example.
---
As for profession, I know it kinda hinges on class, but I was thinking of mining &amp; engineering. 
---
I've been thinking of some of following:
---
* Warrior - tanking and dps, best of two worlds. Leveling will be a huge pain I recall. I kinda want to play dwarf, but minmaxer in me is saying human due to racial. But the dwarf aesthetic... And it might be very popular pick since people know how good they are 
---
* Priest - dwarf priest. Try out WoW healing, become popular, but betray them by doing some sort of weird hodgepodge spec of smite dps/heal. Or shadow.
---
* Rogue - I've always wanted to play a rogue, but I feel that they will be supremely popular and cause bit of competition.
---
* Druid - I really dislike night elves (probably due to the starting area), but I had some silly ideas of playing feral or again, some hodgepodge healer/dps. I hear shifting in-and-out to get energy does wonders for cat. I also think I saw some build that was a mix of resto/balance, which was curious. Not sure if it'd work at all, though.
---
* Mage - I've always envied mages as a warlock. The portals, the water, the aoe, etc. But it seems pretty braindead. Plus vendoring.
---
* Warlock - I don't want to deal with the soul shards again. But the nemesis set...
---
Then again, I guess I could consider alt, but I don't know. I mostly worry about getting pigeonholed into pure healing/boring spec in raids (probably not issue if going with some casual guild/friends, but still)
---
Wow....thanks....I didn't get my 'mean people on the internet' dose today, but you rectified that...you know you can discuss things without being personal and insulting to the other person. But whatever floats your boat, man... :(  
---
Happy to have been your virtual punching bag for the day, hope it was satisfactory for you.
---
[Preach](https://youtu.be/M-D-wW_Sdvc)  made a cool video about it.
---
Good point but it seems most good guilds on private servers use loot council? Isn't it better to join a top tier guild with loot council than a mid tier guild with DKP?  
---
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiit
---
Tactic to do what? Maximize profits? That's why they said "It's about cutting corners and being inhumane for a buck". It's only once in a blue moon that investors' and consumers' interests are compatible. And even rarer that those two plus environment benefits, that's why we will definitely see a catastrophic event in a century.
---
I think it's more likely they will expand on classic then relaunch every old expac. The major reason I think that is any expansion they drop that doesn't use Retail or Classic as a base. Will need a ton of new servers. Very expensive new servers. By re releasing classic Blizzard is agreeing to host 2 MMORPG's at once. Chances are they won't want a third. Unless they plan on taking a dump on all the classic servers they just opened.
---
Corporations are most definitely *not* merit based systems.
---
&gt; It's naive to think there is a better system
---
And it's idiotic to think status quo is the best option. Or best "possible", "realistic" or whatever's the bootlicker adjective of the day.
---
I was in a retail vanilla guild that completed all raids, #3 Horde US on completing Naxx. We always used DKP, I can't even imagine using loot council, we would have never survived past BWL. We were a group of ultra-competetive hardcore gamers. You think a "council" would be accepted by us? Hell no. 
---
A council was ONLY used on Legendaries and for AQ Scepter which officers all got. When you leave it to a council the officers ALWAYS come first. 
---
The ultra-competetive guilds will all use DKP in retail Classic. As far as private servers, I don't know much about them or the guilds. It could be a number of reasons why they do council, for example they have already completed all raids on multiple private servers as a group and figured out an optimal way to gear with a core group, who knows . . also the raids were extremely under-tuned in private servers from what ive seen, for example Nefarians class call could be removed by right-clicking it off the buff/debuff row of your character. Easy raids with free loot means it doesn't matter who gets the loot. 
---
The state of the comment section here is disgusting, "well, he stuck out the job for 10 years so that's on him".. fucking really?
---
So yeah just ignore the fact that Activision Blizzard posted record revenue across the board, boasting the company made 7.5 billion dollars this year alone. More than any other year, ever, in the history of the company.  
---
The fact that NONE of the executives even discussed or went forward with reducing there own ridiculous pay checks, which we have seen other companies do while in times of change to avoid mass layoffs and the follow on effect can devastate families. 
---
And to really spit in the face of employees, they gave there new CFO a $15million sign on bonus, and there CEO takes home on average $28,698,375 per year (not including his board position with Coca Cola company) 
---
The GM writing this article is right.
---
This move was only done to increase a few zeros for there paycheck and boost a dividend for shareholders. 
---
Fuck Activision Blizzard. 
---
Acting like people have 0 agency is whats disingenuous. I can make 11 bucks an hour at my local pizza place. 
---
it's pretty lolly, as a horde priest player, to see how insane alliance meta gets over fear ward
---
By the time we were in Naxx, we had the extra time added onto buffs. Put it on while people are ress'ing, and then start spamming FoL again XD
---
I started at 13 and it had nothing to do with my upbringing.
---
I wanted to try drugs.
---
I just said Corporations need to be reigned in and you consider that the "status quo". . . 
---
You understand if they had just paid the CFO $3,700,000 a year without the sign on bonus then the company could‚Äôve afforded to keep all 800 employees at 50,000 a year
---
Yea I meant in retail wow in general. They turned it into an online ticket submission system. No actual conversation if it can be avoided. 
---
So you do think there is a better system. Good sport.
---
&gt; After all, the vanilla option of "too bad so sad" means less coding for Blizz, and no CM/GM support - double win for them!
---
In vanilla, GMs would fix loot issues for players somewhat regularly.  "too bad so sad" was *never* the "vanilla option".
---
by the definition of objective: "(of a person or their judgement) not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts."
---
it is an opinion to like or dislike the vanilla honor system, whatever unhealthy side effects it had. Or else i could turn it around and say: the raiding in vanilla was objectively bad because it required an unhealthy amount of playing and rewarding account sharing/buying gold. 
---
This is perfect. Thank you.
---
Not really. Strikers mark for example is a obvious Rogue/warr prio item.
---
An odd comment.  If they had laid off 4% of their workforce and Kotick got a 7.5 million dollar bonus, your emotional reaction would be the same.  Presumably, when they did it again next year (for the same total effect as we just saw), you'd be much more angry- angry enough to quit!  
---
But because they did it this way, there's not as much push back.  The human response isn't in proportion to the numbers.  Everyone would be just as angry today if the numbers were a 16% layoff and a 30 million bonus.
---
I am talking about how it is a voluntary exchange of goods and services not that you have a choice to live in a capitalist system you absolute spergs. Of course you have no choice in society, you have no choice in being born and needing food. Jesus get help.

---
Retail refers to the current game.  Classic isn't out yet.  When both are actually for sale on retail, people will settle on some new term.
---
No, Corporations have perveted Capitalism. Corporations by law are counted as a "person" which allowed them to use all kinds of loopholes. Corporations need to be reigned in to allow a better version of Capitalism. 
---
Same with the WC3 remaster. Too bad the EULA will almost certainly be fucked. Can't allow another DOTA2 situation to evolve. Not on Activision's watch.
---
I also know druids even feral ones can do princess Mars runs. Which is around 40g an hour. Not spell gear needed, having around 4k mana and an intervate is enough to kite princess to death with starfall and moonfire
---
lmao
---
If they release a 1.13 version, then everyone who wanted Classic as a preserved state will be upset, and at that point they either need to keep 1.12 and 1.13, or they will risk the mass exodus to private servers again.
---
Plus, your information is plain wrong.  Classic isn't using Classic as a base.  Classic is using the 7.3.5 source code (maybe updated, I'm not sure).  They will have separate folders for files specific to 1.12 and whatever live patch we're on, both within the WoW folder.
---
And they're going to launch the system on virtual servers.  Yes, there is a physical server in there, but it's not like you need a whole new server to launch TBC, especially if the community is largely split between the two.  You just have dynamic resource allocation and run two virtual servers.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work that way. None of it.

I like racials, they add some extra RPG flavor to the game if done right. People didn't faction transfer over any singular racial imbalance, they transfered because nearly ALL the horde racials were better than ALL the alliance ones, for years. Everyone saw it coming and it would have been quite easy to prevent. 
---
In vanilla, racials were even less balanced but it was less of an issue considering the factions had other differences besides racials (paladins/shamans mostly).
---
I made a lot of friends during vanilla‚Äîit was hard not to during hours of wiping every night with them during early MC days.
---
15 years later I still talk to a few of them.  Communities like that are hard to find in games today.
---
Good LC will spread out loot between whole guild and look for  what is best for the guild long term and not just reward ''the best'' dps or whatever
---
CC stuff gets odd, especially when you remember consumables and trinkets.  For instance, a blacksmithing trinket gives you a fear immunity for 30 seconds, but is otherwise a waste of a trinket slot.  A trinket gives you a ranged 3 second stun, but is otherwise a waste of a trinket slot.  If you collect these trinkets, you generally will switch out trinkets in battlegrounds when they are on cooldown, because they have *long ass* cooldowns.  
---
You also Living Action Potion, which removes and renders you immune to stun, slow, and snare, but only for a brief period of time, and Free Action Potion, which doesn't remove anything, but DOES render you immune to them, but for much longer.  
---
So when you consider your example- orc versus undead, as a rogue- it is important to remember that there's a relatively large set of these things that you will be seeking out regardless.  If the stun immunity procs, you skip the stun, but your stun doesn't go on DR either- but every stun used on you has a pretty large opportunity cost, so it's a pretty big win.  By contrast, if you wotf a fear, you put that fear on DR (and I think it's shared with charm for most patches).  You are still going to have *other* answers to charm, fear, stun, etc., all with different costs and cooldowns.
---
To the best of my knowledge which encompasses almost every expansion and many of them at a high levell of pvp and pve: either disc or holy is competitive always. I cant think of one time when both disc and holy were bottom tier for healing in either raiding or pvp. In contrast I can think of many times when disc/holy was the most desirable healer to have for pvp/pve. 
---
Each to their own. Pot + WoW is pretty fun combo, I must say.
---
"Salt Flat Venom" in Shimmering Flats.
---
The creator of that quest is definitely going to hell.
---
I've decided to play a undead clothie in classic, but I'm torn about which class to play! I will be pvp focused/casual player.  For context, I like the playstyle of melting faces and I played spriest in wotlk and necromancer in guild wars.   
---
spriest: seems difficult to gear up, but I like the idea of being unstoppable in 1v1. the option to heal dungeons while leveling is a plus. 
---
warlock: class mechanics eating my bag slots sounds like a pain in the ass, but satan is cool and stuff. seems like the most fun leveling, juggling and dotting mobs + pet
---
mage:  seems like a great/easy leveling experience, but worried that they will be overpopulated. flavor-wise, the most boring of the 3 (for me personally). But it also looks like mages can do EVERYTHING in pvp..
---
I've been watching vids on yt lately. Any insights from pvpers out there?
---
Yea like... no shit. Blizzard doesnt make a new game every year. This is definitely non-news.
---
That's really awesome.  
---
I met my best friend in WoW, we were part of the same guild in vanilla and then one day after a long time (like a year) playing together we were talking about more personal stuff and we realized that not only did we live in the same city, we were the same age and went to the same schools from the 1st to the 6th grade, different classes though, had a ton of mutual friends and all that, so we "knew" each other already but we just didn't hang out in the same groups.
---
&gt;I was wondering which class was the most improved in TBC.
---
Prot / Ret pally.
---
This thread is misleading and incorrect.
---
I suggest that you actually read or listen to the entire earnings call before posting about it. That way you would know that WoW as a department is actually getting more development staff. 
---
Which of these is more satisfying to you?  
---
-WotF allowing you to completely cheese some raid mechanics, while giving you a brutal and unneeded advantage in pvp against a variety of fear mechanics, a common and crushing CC against rogues, while also having some cute underwater ganking tricks.  
---
-Sometimes being completely immune to the stuns that land all around you in pvp, while sometimes being totally vulnerable to them, outside of your control?  When the immunity procs even once, it's often enough to turn a fight, but you can never count on it... and also, having an actually useful racial you can use for extra dps in pve or pvp?  
---
If all you cared about was pvp, the answer is undead- wotf is disgusting and unnecessary, and you will laugh at the absolute humiliation it provides.  Orc is no slouch in pvp, but it does not compare to the brutality undead provides.  If all you cared about was pve, orc is the winner, because they have a legitimately useful damage ability, and undead has a utility CC immunity that is sometimes helpful.  
---
But with both, you need to decide what to do.  
---
Fun fact:  I've never heard someone say "I had this totally awesome undead rogue, and I race changed to orc just as soon as I could".
---
Stupid cunts are just racing to the bottom
---
"they're going to launch the system on virtual servers." I get that but unless they said they are going to use sharding. Those extra "virtual servers" will take a metric ton of money to host. This is one of the reasons they didn't want to remake classic to begin with.  
---
Yes they are going to use the current patch as a base. That might give them a good start but in Blizzards own words. They feel creating classic wow is akin to agreeing to host a second full scale MMORPG. All I am saying is they prolly won't want to do a third.
---
I really don't think it's a good idea to give extra rewards to "hard" classes when it comes to game design. This coming from a Warrior player. People will always play warriors if they want to, there's no need to give them absurd DPS. 
---
It's a reality of Classic WoW, but I'm 100% sure it wasn't intended.
---
Soullink is great for duels and world pvp because you are so extremely tanky that you can wear out most classes.  
---
Most PvP videos are based around 1v1 encounters and big crits something SL does well (the first part at least) and Conflag ruin or the drakedogg specs.  
---
However, come premade bgs you will find you dps lacking. In premades SM ruin locks are mostly brought.  
---
I myself am not so PvP savvy however there are plenty of fellow locks in the [classic warlock discord](https://discord.gg/7daXYyA) that could shine some more light(or rather darkness) on the topic.
---
&gt; So while i'm not asking for anything to be changed, it is an objective flaw.
---
Something you do not like does not make it objective flaw.
---
From my point of view, making hybrid classes being able to do dps like pure dps is a flaw in an RPG.
---
What does the 1.12 wotf do anyway?  It was changed so many times I don't recall.  The version I remember for quite some time was, you'd *become undead* for some amount of time- 6 seconds stands out in my head, but I know it was something crazy long before then- and during that time, sure, you were immune to fear, seduce, and other junk, but you were vulnerable to exorcism and that golden bondage thing priests do, the undead-specific CC.  Also I think turn undead could hit you too.  
---
So which version is 1.12?  Was it the later one that just breaks fear with no downside?
---
More realistically you'll be deleting your account in 8 months since if you get triggered this badly at being called out I can't imagine how angry you get at being dead wrong.
---
Great reply thank you so much for taking the time to write it! I'd give you gold if I weren't broke.
---
Okay so this is the thing... they dont look at who they are laying off. They look at numbers and say "we are laying off these people and these salaries", this comes from the top where they dont know or care how good at their job someone is, they are just moving numbers, they just saw the dollar signs connected to him as something they didnt want to pay.
---
Warlocks are far harder to play in everything but raiding
---
Loot trading allow you to trade any bop item you get until 2h later.
---
If you log off, the time while you go off doesn't count (that mean that you can log off for a week and still trade it to someone who was in your group).
---
Then they'd still be flaws. The question wasn't if you love the flaws, it was if the game had any.
---
WoW, more than anything the story of WoW, died with Arthas.
---
I would personally choose warlock but that is because warlock is my personal favorite class.  
---
It would really help if you would provide some info of what you want out of the game/ class you are going to play.  
---
Although both classes are clothie casters they do have their differences, pros, and cons.  
---
I would highly recommend having a looksie in both the [warlock](https://discord.gg/7daXYyA) and [mage](https://discord.gg/QyevcaD) discord.  
---
Short synopsis for PvE would be: Mages do higher dps but warlock has IMHO a more interesting time in raids.  
---
Short synopsis for leveling would be: Warlocks have the easier and quicker time leveling, although mages are close behind it with AoE leveling.  
---
Short synopsis for farming would be: Mages are the more optimal farmer but locks are close behind it and can utilize the same spec as they use for pve and pvp if they go SM Ruin, needing less respecs.  
---
I will not provide a synopsis for pvp as I am not to well versed in it.
---
&gt; cleanse everything  
---
Paladins can't remove curse, one of the "big four".  They also lack an offensive dispel.
---
Classic needs more community managers than developers. Way more.
---
Enhancement shaman. If it were remotely viable as a pve spec in Vanilla I would play one. Was enhancement from TBC-Cata.
---
&gt; If you just go slow but steady enough with a few potions and consumables with decent gear, some cooldowns, and playing intelligently, you can do it solo
---
Yeah, it's pretty apparent in such situations that at *some* point, WoW was a game that required and rewarded a somewhat tactical, thoughtful playstyle - opposed to the relatively button-mashy, twitch gameplay they're going for nowadays.
---
&gt; You will perpetually be several % below the humans on the damage meters if you roll a dwarf rogue.  
---
Human's sword tricks are not "several %" above other races.  This is just horseshit.  
---
Consider:  
---
-Humans only get this benefit with swords.  You may find an upgrade that is not a sword.  You will get zero benefit from the sword racial until such time as you acquire another sword.  
---
-You get weapon skill as itemization through other items.  This means that, while a human using a sword has more favorable options, it never ends up being as good as the 5 raw sword skill would be if there were no items to fix that.  You will have to give up *something* to get those weapon skill, but it sure as shit won't be "several percent".  
---
Sure, humans are the optimal pve dps race for Alliance rogue.  But it **sure as shit isn't several percent**.
---
I make more as a salesman at Best buy than a blizzard game master? And they're in California? Maybe I'm not in a bad place after all

Classic wow is canceled. Time to delete this sub.

? Druid can tank these fine. You will need a lot of tank anyway so you won't be picky about that in any case.
---
Is that the other one I was thinking of?  I think it was far enough away from DKP that it was it's own separate thing, but don't remember how it worked.  Something about how the gold was re-distributed after the run.
---
I mean in a certain sense, Blizz posted what, several billions worth of revenue? So if he can make choices for the company that make a positive difference worth just a couple of percent points, he is very much worth the relative pittance.
---
But you know, the real answer is no.
---
Never played a warlock so I can't speak on the skill cap on the last 10% of what the class can do. That being said Drain tanking in good gear is a great way to easily face roll anything. Mages require far more finesse to do anything.
---
On the pserver i'm on, almost every alliance guild got at least one bear. Some even more. I even see some guild specifically looking for bear.

---
Nice, was hoping to hear that about Enhancement shamans. What made them suddenly viable in TBC, the dual wielding?
---
Yeah something like that.
---
People would bid gold on items and the gold would be evenly redistributed after the run accross the raiders.
---
I think you have it backwards mate. Acti-blizz is stealing Sweden's governments money, not the other way around. You can tell by the way they're doing something illegal.
---
Hunters don't scale well
---
I remember that quest.. I was doing it with my friend too, and the drop wasnt shared... we were there about 3 hours until we both got it.
---
Correct.
---
The issue with hunters is that half your power comes from your pet.  And your pet doesn't scale.  At all.
---
In TBC, pets started to receive a percentage of your Attack Power and a percentage of your Stamina.  This is why in TBC, AP was the single best stat for a BM hunter (believe Crit was best for a MM hunter and Agi for SV).  But in Vanilla, there was no pet scaling, so a significant portion of your damage as a fresh 60 never got boosted from gear.
---
Probably not _most_ improved, but TBC made Shadow Priests from a buffer for Warlocks into a legit sought after Mana Battery/Offhealer/Support DPS class.
---
Good read until it rails on capitalism at the end. Capitalism is and always will be superior to every other econonic system. 
---
Ret/prot paladin for sure, prot was given a taunt and ret was given an instant melee attack.
---
Enhancement shaman was kinda playable outside of raids- it had an instant melee attack, and some okish tricks.  By comparison, retribution paladin was a total joke.  
---
I'd say ret pally was the most improved by BC, even more than enhancement shaman.
---
exactly
---
Very generous of you, comrade.
---
&gt;  what definitely matters is that micro transactions generate a lot more revenue than the monthly subscriptions.
---
There's no way that they're getting more in WOW microtransactions than subscription fees. What could you even buy to spend $15 a month? Buying every pet and mount in the store right now separately will cost you $415. More than $180 for a year, but you know virtually no one is buying all that. 
---
Incredibly idiotic. It's entirely up to the employee to decide where to sell their labor.
---
It really depends on your tank.  Our MT was almost all prot, had amazing damage reduction gear and his aggro gen was shit because of it.  DPS had to go really slow at the start of some fights.  Our OT was mostly fury and 15 points prot and we barely had to wait with him.  
---
Moral of the story: find a tank that understands that threat generation is much more important than damage migration on most fights and who gears &amp; specs for it.
---
/roll with +1 system
---
It is absolutely a huge difference lol. I've not only played fury extensively but I'm a longtime member and follower of the 2 main (1 is now discontinued) theorycrafting discords for pservers. If you want to link me your gear we can literally put it in a spreadsheet right now and I can tell you the exact percentage difference. I did not give any specific numbers because I'm giving advice to someone who hasn't even made their character yet. Your point about giving up stats is also false, nothing is that black and white. Figuring out your theoretical max DPS is a moving target that changes with each and every piece of gear you get. If you are min maxing you will change things constantly as you get new pieces. Being a human opens up a ton more options due to not only how hit cap and glancing blows work but also also crit cap when you are world buffed. There will come a time when more normal stats are literally useless when you are near bis and world buffed. This is why edgemasters gauntlets, a lvl 44 mail item with no stats, go for literal thousands of gold depending on the server haha.
---
If you are playing casually, or thinking about the leveling grinding experience then yes, it does not matter. 
---
If you are the type of player to use spreadsheets then you will be gimping yourself and severely limiting your gearing options. And the people who use spreadsheets to push the cutting edge will absolutely beat you. By MORE than a few percent in fact, because they are likely minmaxing mechanics and rotation better than you too, like timing their cooldowns around the guilds previous kill times and using MPOWA to line up crusader procs with other cooldowns and monitoring flurry stacks to fall off etc etc
---
You should check out Ranger and Myskillkills YouTube videos of some PvP was n naxx gear
---
Tanking them isn't the issue, the tank switches are.
---
My server never really had a Nax era before TBC came out but I was murdering people in BGs with a BWL geared hunter during the AQ period. Frankly, I felt massively overpowered wielding Ashjre'thul.  Maybe Nax gear flips that script, but I would bet that even with classic servers there isn't going to be a huge number of Nax geared players in most BGs.
---
Huh?
---
Record sales != record profits. Read next time, before posting 
---
He should be downvoted for making a bad blanket statement ripped from an even worse occupy speech.
---
Argue about what should or shouldn't be considered taxable income.
---
The statement he made is completely ignorant.
---
Zero Sum DKP:  https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Zero-sum_DKP 
---
Firstly as a PVP class Hunters are always fine. Even after Naxx they may not be the best but they are still good. That being said as a Hunter post BWL you are not considered a DPS. If you want to be a raid DPS I would not recommend a hunter. Every rogue and warrior will through a tantrum if you get anything good past BWL.
---
As a hunter the big deal in raiding is kiting not DPS. What will decide you a spot is your ability to kite and bear the burden of 39 people raging at you if you screw up. Hunter is a thankless class frankly. You will always be fine in pvp though.
---
Faction change - Ninja Looters switching factions.
---
Race Change - get geared easily as alliance than switch to horde for PvP since most horde racial are better in PvP
---
also many times 1 faction tends to own the BG, so when you are tired of losing or trying to grind for the R14 - you may decide to change faction/race and make things even more lopsided. 
---
You /roll on an item for your main spec, and if you win, you get a +1 tag. Thereafter, first prio goes to main spec without +1 tags, then main spec with +1 tag, then off-spec. Usually this resets for the endboss.
---
Do you guys who downvoted not have phones?
---
I doubt the budget nor team size for classic makes enough of a dent in the grand scheme of Activision-Blizzard's multitude of projects to warrant it being considered a Frontline release by investors. 
---
Too bad you made such a good post that will go largely ignored by most people with no knowledge of the subject.
---
People are content understanding 'rich = bad' and generally spend more time bringing Netflix instead of actually educating themselves. I want to constantly deliver long diatribes about the depressing state of people's personal financial health but what's the point?
---
Yes, dual weilding was a huge upgrade. Along with the reworked talents, which was probably the bigger thing for most specs.
---
Dual wield, passive mana regen from Water Shield, bonus AP group buff, an active mana regen CD, reduced shock mana cost after melee crits, shocks scaling with AP via Mental Quickness, and actually decent itemization.
---
Same reason as hunter, most raids only take 2 as they are a handicap compared to other healers. And people won't know that because they are new so I would expect a fair amount of people to be competing for those 2 spots.
---
This is what everyone says, but I was always crushing damage meters in Vanilla as a hunter. But to be fair we didn't really do much Naxx as TBC was coming out and everyone didn't feel like grinding the raid just to replace everything in a month 
---
I still have PTSD from this quest 15 years later.
---
If it‚Äôs better than the current weapon of your hunters then it should still go to them. Understandably it would be a tough pill to swallow for the Rogue/Warr.
---
K bye
---
Nearly two decades too late on that one, Blizz.
---
I don't know what you mean by "you're speaking for yourself" in this context. I gave myself and my attitude as an example. I said that "laid off" is language used to signal lack of wrongdoing. We are not required to make word choices which signal lack of wrong doing.
---
Most good guilds have a fury heavy MT for speed running and only ever spec prot for PTR progression. Some horde guilds even benefit from giving weapons like Crul'shorukh to the MT before any fury :/
---
I like how you simply ignore lvl 110 character boosts, name/faction/realm changes which are very pricey and part of the micro transactions program as well. Many retail players have bought at least one character boost for BfA since they made leveling a lot slower at the end of Legion. And that alone is 60$. Micro transactions are definitely more profitable, especially with those low sub numbers. I'm not sure about the current state of the WoW Token for subscription time (and micro transactions), but that might be a factor as well.
---
Don‚Äôt be dumb. Strikers mark doesnt allow a hunter to pull of his raid rotation properly.
---
This is my concern. I want to main a troll priest, but i'm worried i wont have any efficient way to make gold.
---
I need to know. Is this a meme/exaggeration or true?
---
Unless you played a hunter or warlock. 
---
Which is also fine.
---
I think many/most GMs work out in Texas, FYI
---
So from your personal experience do Warlocks out dps Mages in Naxxaramus?
---
You mean undead rogue PvP videos 
---
Darker night is what I live for. I hope there will be an addon or smth. 
---
&gt; Fury being strong means there's more tanks on the server,
---
Lol, convincing a fair-weather fury warrior to tank is like pulling teeth.
---
You have tremor totem. Which is a shitty, but party-wide fear ward with 100% uptime.
---
Im leveling my first warlock now (I'm 48), and it feels incredibly strong in PvP. The soul shards aren't that big of a deal really to me. You can solo a lot of stuff that other classes would struggle with.
---
prot paladin:
---
changed shield block talents from requiring being crit to % chance on hit.  one of the main goals of tank itemization is not being crit so these talents were useless in progression content.  
---
added more mitigation/EHP throughout the talent tree.  6% DR from improved righteous fury, 4% spell DR, 30% DR when sub 35% hp,  6% stam, 10% stam talents, more holy shield charges, more def skill from anticipation.
---
consecrate baseline which saves a ton of talent points.
---
spiritual attunement so they have some mana regen in combat.  still had to mana mana, downrank spells to balance threat/mana regen but it allowed you to gain back mana outside of items. 
---
properly itemized gear (relevant for all hybrids, but the prot pally dungeon tier set is actually solid, especially 2 piece or the reduce consecrate mana cost)
---
a taunt (not that big of a deal compared to the rest tbh)
---
prot's still "rough" compared to wotlk onward and you'd never choose one over a warrior for main tanking bosses (there are exceptions) but it is a night and day difference between vanilla and tbc.  tbc prot paladin is one of my favorite specs ever
---
&gt; than enhancement shaman.
---
Ret pally was a lot stronger in lvl 60 pvp than an ehance shaman. I know people meme'd with Hand of Rag etc but it really was a very poor spec, you'd get kited/cc'd to death by any ranged class and had no defense against warriors/rogue. Pally with cleanse/bubble/Freedom/HoJ was a far stronger class in reality.
---
How many players will have their experience materially affected by the race chosen by other players in their group? Good news, friend!  I did the math.  The number is exactly 39x more than the number of people who will be "bullied" about their choice to play a less than optimal race/class combo.
---
The number is small for both.
---
You have no clue what you're talking about. Striker's Mark should never go to a hunter. It's garbage for hunters and BiS for melees. That's as idiotic as suggesting that [Eye of Nerub](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23039) should go be melee prio because it's a melee weapon.
---
If I see a hunter with Striker's Mark, I know that his guild has no clue what they're doing.
---
Actually the reason is that Hagatha, with of witchwood summoned Baku the Mooneater as her general who ate the White Lady. 
---
No occasional exorcism? 
---
