There are more people here saying BGs should be in Classic than there are saying they should be left out.  You lose.

---
Latency is definitely more noticable for melee, absolutely.
---
streamer clips are infinitely more valid to post than memes, you just sound jealous
---
I don't think anyone disagreed with that particular point. They just also want BG, and I'm in the same boat.
---
He looks confused during this duel. If you watch his stream, he is visibly confused lol
---
Was added to F&amp;F Thursday the 16th around 2pm, still awaiting an invite.

You believe those fairy tales? psh...

"wears plate" lol. Find me a holy pally not wearing cloth I'm at least a couple slots.
---
I was testing your method out yesterday on a pserver (yeah yeah classic might differ...) but my dps was not good at all as it had some problems. Elemental devastation doesn't proc that much so i'm spending more time than i expected casting LBs. I could also downrank LB to rank 3 making elemental devastation considerably more common but then my LB damage was very low. The other problem was that i don't feel like elemental devastation lasts long enough to justify this kind of build. Every time elemental devastation would proc, i would still pretty much waste almost half of the buff's uptime changing weapon and waiting for the first swing. That being said, i could time the shock right at the end of the buff, and if it crit, i would have 9 more seconds that i could take full advantage of which was nice. Also the mana would last which is also nice. However, if my theory on the timing on my staff build is right i am still more inclined to go that way as i did get considerably more dps.  
---
Also, what kind of gear would you expect to use? I was using the AQ set with a heavy weapon. The rest of the gear was mainly spell crit so i would get Elemental Devastation more often.
---

---
One last thing, if you are interested in further discussing about this and testing some more stuff out hmu on discord Afli#0363
---
Then you should really care about getting Classic down before trying for changes.
---
Were you able to see nameplates through walls in Vanilla? I thought that wasn't the case.
---
But failed on Herod pretty badly
---
I think it's just a list with priority over regular signups, it's not a guaranteed beta slot.
---
Yes I'm ignoring you because you're just parroting the same shit everyone else is saying when I can just say   
---
"MORE PLAYERS DOING INSTANCED PVP == LESS PVPERS IN THE WORLD."  
---
And it shuts down literally any argument against removing organized PVP.  I don't understand how you can say " I'm not agruing that BGs pulled people out of wPvP. Of course it did. "  
---
and then turn your back and say " There are tons of people who are looking forward to playing BGs. Me included. " like it's a good thing for the game.    
---
\&gt;It's not the best part for everyone and you're not the most important person who is going to play in vanilla.  
---
Nah, it's definitely the best part.  wPvP is dynamic, intense, chaotic, and it feels \*real\*.  BG's are just robotic rank/kill farming bullshit.    
---
The real question is, why not give wPvP a reason to exist?  Add some wPvP content to balance.
---
can't wait for AV mass-test, eh?
---
I’ve never seen one, but I’ve heard they’re around
---
Wait the game isn't released yet right? Still in beta I thought.
---
Years ago. Invited during the F&amp;F wave the other day. Can confirm that only a few people from each list were invited. If you're on a list but not one of the three who got priority, you're SOL.
---
I was just pointing out that looking visibly confused is a redundant statement since looking and visibly mean the same thing in context. I knew what you meant that he looks confused :)
---
Vanilla
---
I'd bet it's so that the gnomes' mounts are scaled up, to give them the 'overcompensating' thing
---
Then why do you support the downfall of wPvP instead of building on top of it before BG's are released?  
---
I'm sure if the community wanted some wPvP content we could get it eventually.  Capturable bases, killing faction leaders, etc.
---
Honestly the wow community has to be the absolute hardest to please. First it's we want legacy servers. We finally get blizzard to to do them. Then everyone has a different take on how it should go. Changes, no changes, I don't like this specific part of vanilla let's remove it completely despite it being a part of the original game, etc etc. As for world pvp goes just keep planning Tauren mill raids it's still a possibility even with bgs in the game if you gather enough of your faction the opposite factions will eventually have to respond especially if you attack near a main city.
---
Except you have it backwards, private servers didn't change the size value of gnomes, they didn't know what it was and had to guess and like a lot of guesswork, they didn't get all their guesses quite right.
---
To clarify, so the client simply has the base gnome model (1x), the server is what dictates what the actual size of the gnomes are. The private servers don't know what scaling value the actual vanilla servers used for gnomes so they guessed (incorrectly apparently)
---
how do you know the script wasnt working in vanilla?
---
I’m a customer service rep and do operations. Usually I can do my work and still play. 
---
I would use parsec to hop on my computer and play through my work laptop usually works great!
---
Some days I get a long session in, unless I’m swamped then I can only do the dailies and some random auction house stuff.
---
When classic drops I can’t wait to grind mobs at work haha
---
mobs can dodge from any angle, but only parry in the front, players can't dodge from behind.
---
Out of curiosity, what would you do on classic outside of raiding?
---
#1 response
---
Because wPvP is real, and fluid.  It takes place in the game and not in some far-off battleground universe.  I want them to see that it's more magical in general, and should be EXPANDED upon.  Reward people for wPvP equally or moreso than organized PvP.

You aren't worth having a conversation with. You basically put your fingers in your ear and go "la la la la i can't hear you, I'm 100% right and your opinion doesn't matter, only my opinion matters la la la la"

No you.

yep, like 5 hours ago or so

I wish. There would be a small portion of us in right now.

You're right, because most of you are dumb as shit and can't comprehend what I'm saying.
---
Easy to navigate wise Iron Forge, Scenery I would choose Darnassus
---
They wouldn't. He will though. Because he's the CEO of a company that produces crap compared to what they produced 15 years ago.   
---
Also, yes, Classic could produce good money for Blizzard for a few years, like 3-5 years. Then what? No company will be looking at these short term successes. They will want to be successful after 5 years from now. And Classic will be at it's end game by then. So imagine if Classic does well and then obviously comes to an end. They can't rely on Classic to do good. They have to have a long term plan.
---
Please stop you're triggering my PTSD.
---
Winterspring frostsaber is a unique mount that requires exalted with the winterspring trainers. So you don’t need exalted with Darn or IF you need exalted with the winterspring faction.
---
Im basing it on the fact that gnomes on retail are bigger and the gnomes in the beta look like them.  calm down.
---
&gt;Private servers run on literally vanilla code and have been since they first popped up back in 06.
---
Theyve never run on vanilla server data.
---
Eh, he kind of is. 
---
I've heard a lot of people decry enthusiasm for classic WoW as nostalgia or hardcore elitism or what have you, and I've always disagreed with that assessment because I've seen people make very clear arguments for why classic interests them more than retail; that the cycle of level-cap raising expansions invalidated older content (why raid MC for epics if you can get better greens from questing?), and that things like LFR teleportation and flying mounts made the world a lot smaller and damaged the strength of community the game had.
---
When people argue against things like new raid content that attempts to avoid the above problems because "nochanges" without making any actual arguments for how that would harm what made classic good, they *are* just appealing to nostalgia.
---
thank you
---
Arguing semantics now are we?  
---
Anyways...if you aren't open for some changes eventually this game will die out just like it did before.
---
Look at who youre replying to. If this dude isnt a troll with a name like that and then throwing in that "feminized horde" comment id be shocled.
---
the pve/pvp thing is more if you are going to pvp more than pve pick undead, and troll if pve more than pvp, else just pick whatever one you think looks better
---
wPvP will always be around as long as people need to go quest.
---
Some people like structure, and leaderboards, and the 1v1 type competition that BG brings.
---
/console cameradistancemaxfactor 4. I could type that out in half a second back in the day
---
God bless you. Being able to move from NA. I'm in Trump territory and wish you the best.
---
No. My reason? Because that's what it was during Vanilla and this is a recreation of Vanilla.
---
The average person could pvp well enough in their pve spec. Those who cared enough to pvp or pve with an optimal spec would get out and farm the gold they needed for this. They didn't hop on the forums and QQ that it cost too much.
---
Magic on allies/self: Priest, Paladin, Felhunter
---
Magic on enemies: Priest, Shaman, Felhunter
---
Yeah /r/wow is pretty tight on it's moderation. I forgot what it was but I got suspended for calling some dude a retard. In my defense I'm pretty sure he was retarded.
---
So classic runs on an engine which has had thousands of changes since 2004/5 and yet they claim its correct? Yeah. No.
---
My gnome warrior was tiny, not chunky and fat like it is now.
---
Vanilla Private Servers are and have been running a vanilla client since 2006, using vanilla code.
---
Reminder the classic devs consider xrealm bgs (which werent added until 1.12 or 1.12.1 (or like MadSeasonShow said: barely made it in), bnet friendlist, modern graphics, 1.12 class nerfs (from phase 1) etc as true to vanilla.
---
So wPvP will only exist until people reach 60? What?  wPvP existed even at 60, moreso before BGs were added.
---
&gt;Some people like structure, and leaderboards, and the 1v1 type competition that BG brings.
---
Basically the things that killed the game's world.
---
Killing M'uru was the hardest feat in WoW. It took us over 500 wipes. Thousands of gold in repairs and consumables, per-person. But when we finally got it down it was the greatest sense of accomplishment I've ever felt in the game. It made everything worth it.
---
Kil'Jaden was next boss. It took us less than 10 attempts. It was boring. We downed it and I felt nothing but the urge to log off and go to bed.
---
PS: I have more money than you HAHA
---
You'd be surprised how flawed your memory can be.
---
No, you should be a Holy Paladin on raid night and spend the rest of the week mastering Holy Paladin in BGs because you ARE A HOLY PALADIN!
---
Why would they be modern ?
---
They wouldn't even bother asking if there were issues. It'd be more like:
---
&gt;Is Fo76 done yet?
---
&gt;Uh, its functional but we haven't even QA'd it y-
---
&gt;So, yes. Release it
---
For got all about this classic
---
I remember when my friend first told me that thousand needles used to be all dried up, and this all happened when cata happened. I'm really excited to see how the original world was like for the first time!

BGs didn't kill wPVP.  Rewards killed wPVP.
---
Colour has only been used for class not role and for icons the only ones i've seen are the ones used in the [LFG system introduced in WotLK](https://i.imgur.com/rXzBdJI.png).
---
That site still loads a bunch of extra useless stuff like news articles, blog posts etc etc.
---
I got in last night
---
I may be underestimating it but I imagine 1-10 will be a shit show on day launch but it will start to fade from 10-20 since you are now hours into the leveling process.
---
I suggest anyone actually wanting to get some leveling done to do it during off hours (12am - 12pm) on launch. I plan to wake up at around 3:00 am to start it up.
---
We had someone we called the "Cleanse Queen" in my MC raiding guild.
---
She was just the best (maybe best PC/latency?) paladin and always got the most cleanses done on Lucifron.
---
Or maybe she just had a pact with a druid or mage to decurse her first so she didn't run low on mana ever.... lol
---
It wasn't for like 5 years, and also why race change when deviates exist, ezpz

Classic outperforming retail would be doom and gloom for retail WoW.

Yeah.. Grinded to r13 back in the day before got burned out with honor grind. And it was exactly like that for closer to 18h a day.

That's far from being a rogue's only purpose in wsg though. They're also great at recovering flags from enemy carriers

There're LFG Mondays in this subreddit.

You can do it with any class/race in retail.
---
Will Classic have the feature to stop getting exp from BGs? I can't remember if BGs gave exp on flag caps/wins and such in Vanilla, or if it was some quest turn in you did after the BG. I know I leveled a few characters exclusively in BGs and I can't wait to do that again.
---
Thanks for the soul shard. . . . BITCH!
---
Bgs took the R14 farmers who were camping flightmasters and everything that was lvl 48+  preventing anyone from getting anything done.
---
10% stats is not 10% damage, it is much less.
---
No dude, you're the one who is dumb as shit. It's not hard to understand the difference between opinion and fact.
---
I have no issue with you liking wPvP but it's your OPINION(I'll google the definition for you: "a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge." or "a generally held view ")
---
wPvP is not the best part about vanilla, in your opinion it is but that isn't everyone's opinion.
---
You are far too dense to understand the difference.
---

 Alliance Human Warrior looking for guild on EU.   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hi all. I'm really excited for the Classic launch and I thought I'll start looking for a guild now. Hopefully find a nice bunch of people I can get to know a little bit before Classic goes live.  
---
About myself... I first played WoW in September 2005. Made a dwarf warrior called Drothmor. Only made it to lvl 32 before I burnt out and life got in the way. I worked 12+ hour days then and had a girlfriend I lived with and she wanted some of my attention, work days were long etc... So it was difficult.   
---
Fast forward to present, I have some Vanilla memories, but it's all really blurry. Barely played  TBC and WotLK, skipped Cata and played some Pandas. Got quite involved in WoD (eww) and played a lot of Legion. BfA I almost haven't touched.   
---
What I will be looking for in a guild is not necessarily a guild full of elite players rushing to 60. What I'd love to do is to find a group who I could relive the magic of Vanilla again. People who log into Discord and just talk about every day life as they level, people who help each other and people who become friends.  Ideally a UK based guild, if not, definitely EU. English speaking. Mature but a twist of childish nonsense is always welcome, it makes me laugh.  
---
Oh, forgot to mention, I'll have 2 weeks of holiday starting on the 27th August. Convenient, right?  Hit me up if you are looking for someone like me.
---
'Gift' lmao Activision-Blizzard is a multibillion dollar company and classic is a pure business move, like everything else.
---
thats why you're the law talkin guy
---
Okay since you say that lets do a thought experiment.
---
Rewards + NO BG's = everyone has to wPvP to get rewards
---
Rewards + BG's = everyone farms BGs for easy kills
---
NO rewards + BG's = BG's either die out or it's 50/50 between wPvP and BG.
---
NO rewards + NO BG's = no reason to PvP besides "fun".  (this is basically what we have in classic).
---
I personally think Rewards + NO BG's would be the most fun, because it would make people venture out into the world and search for PvP.  They could then expand on this idea and add in "wPvP locations" that give some sort of reward for participating in.  wPvP would happen in and around these "wPvP locations" mainly, and would create a more intense experience in the world.
---
thanks for that, appreciate it mate.
---
Sadly in 1.12 version they have the cool down. Kinda sucks, but what can ya do? I'm disappointed too :(
---
Still exists today and will exist in Classic.
---
Adding to that, seeing all the old zones that were typically avoided (for good reason tbh) and getting to know what they have to offer
---
This comment reeks of bo and neckbeard.
---
Too me that doesn't suggest that Leroy yelling was a real thing. They're saying that they made the video as a caricature of all the bad pugs they've had were people would generally act like idiots and rush in to pulls before they were ready. I'd give Leroy credit for coming up with the warcry, pugs didn't even really use voice chat back then.
---
I'm just pointing out the overview of things. My honest opinion is that we should be happy we're even getting wow classic you know how long people have been pushing for this I first remember starting in cata which was almost 10 years ago. Just lean back and enjoy wow how it was 14 years ago maybe you have a point about bgs contributing to the death of wpvp but it's not like it single handedly ended it but wpvp is still possible and if you organize groups you can make it happen.
---
Woah now, I took those screenshots, lets not make fun of my photography just because that dude is bonkers :(
---
How did vanilla wow die?
---
I like those. I will have to try to find separate images of them. Thanks :)
---
what you mean by that? I watch the whole thing and thought he did really good.
---
Santa isn’t real. Sorry to break it to you like this.
---
&gt; It's not hard to understand the difference between opinion and fact.
---
Clearly projecting here.  
---
You seem to not understand that wPvP is the literal center and core of vanilla.  
---
When they strayed far from the core, the game turned to shit.  Period.
---
Do we tell him?
---
still have PTSD from the harpie quest in the cave
---
Not in game, I'm at 9g and level 26
---
I think most people mean chronologically, after Naxx releases in the last phase of vanilla content, not a tier of dungeon beyond Naxx in the progression.
---
No
---
Only in range of the healthbar/nameplate activation.
---
You won’t be able to disable experience, if it’s like vanilla.  If I remember correctly. I could be wrong.
---
By the end of vanilla, leafy friend!

that to me looks like gnome is the correct height? top of the gnomes are basically at the bottom of the dwarfs chest/top of the belly, not below the belly
---
No life for $100 please
---
With the over-expansion, over-casualization, and removal of community.  BG's/arenas/organized PvP are heavily included in that.
---
Its not going to happen so drop it.
---
You can write your fan-fic all you want but its not going to happen.
---
Obviously you save DI for the main tank
---
if wPvP was better/funnier than BGs, people would overlook the fact that BGs are more rewarding and wPvP.
---
BGs are just a better pvp experience than a 1-minute-100-vs-100-battle. And it shows.
---
I'll talk about whatever I want, thanks.
---
I think they play a different MMO called r/outside if I remember correctly.
---
Kara was brilliant. But I don't want any increase in power. The gear treadmill gets too old too quickly.
---
Nah they ran on thin air and everyone imagined they even existed.
---
Quick math:
---
Back in 2006, when they made the servers.
---
How do you think they scaled their models?
---
Did damage and encounters/mechanics?
---
Quests? Droprates?
---
By literally comparing the emu vs retail SIDE BY SIDE in realtime.
---
Its not a difficult concept.
---
RemindMe! 96 days
---
idk why you are worrying about something that's gonna happen years down the line.
---
Enjoy the game for what it is, and if you can't well that is on you.
---
Neither play a warrior
---
Correct. Never said they didn't.
---
WPvP was chipped away until arenas. BGs won't kill WPvP. They will chip away a tiny bit but not to the extent Arenas had due to balancing around comps.
---
In Vanilla you HAD to be out in the world to do things. There was no escaping it.
---
The more the game progressed through expansions, the more and more you could get away with not doing things in the open world.
---
If i remember right /spelleffects xxx is really funny if you set it to like 5000.

---
I noticed that, you guys were up right at 1.12 and I started checking up on items in the classic db and saw a bunch of new older comments. Super helpful
---
As a gnome player I was concerned! And as a roleplayer I gotta ensure my partners feel like they won't impale me :^]
---
Go right ahead, it won't change anything
---
Does that mean you'd be able to get the T2 helms off of Onyxia, but none of the rest of the sets until after phase 1?
---
Yeah, I'm trying to remember when that change rolled out.
---
&gt;people would overlook the fact that BGs are more rewarding than wPvP.
---
Not in a game that's all about gear.  
---
&gt;\&gt;BGs are just a better pvp experience than a 1-minute-100-vs-100-battle. And it shows.
---
  
---
You clearly never wPvPed to any extreme extent.  The game has so much more to offer than stale, robotic, instanced PvP.  For you to ignore that and call yourself a Warcraft fan makes me cringe.
---
Nobody mentioning the hilarious ending? ahhaha
---
genuinely very upset.
---
Thott bot was virtually fucking useless on many quests. It was great for item drop rates mostly
---
You ignored the part where they said that Blizzard has a working reference copy of Vanilla 1.12 to check this stuff.
---
Classic Payo
---
Pretty sure it was later.
---
Is there an email or something you get if you get beta access? My pc is currently being fixed so i cant check the bnet app.
---
Ffxiv has both and still maintains a strong community. LFR and LFG are not the reasons the community is the way it is in modern. I would argue that the major reason would lay within hoe Blizzard populates the map - pulling random players from random servers until it hits a quota.
---
Because reaction time is the only difficult thing about gaming lmao. Not to mention starcraft and league are not even about reaction time
---
I'm expecting someone to get into a cave that was removed.  Poly'd through a wall or something.
---
Used to do that 18h a day when grinding honor. Rogues sure can be good recovering the flags, but before that usually you have been guarding the flag first. Rogues are pretty much only class that can reliably stop/slow down stealthy druids from sprinting away with the flag in the first place.
---
Something to note about the sizes, the tweaked the FOV.  In vanilla when the average monitor size was 1024 x 768 and with a 4:3 aspect ratio had a different FOV than the modern client does.  They've allowed for you to zoom out much further as a percentage of screenspace and then fixed the  aspect ratio to be more wide angle.  This also accounts for the extremely poor (but flavorful) distortion This was updated in wrath to give better panoramic views and was immediately noticeable to everyone who was playing in that transition.
---
It went from having a whimsical fish eye from when you scrolled in to actually being correct with a static fov.  Best way for someone to check is stand in the exact same spot on an "undocumented server" and beta and take a look at something in the distance with different zooms (all the way in, character 50% of screen height, character 25% of screen height and all the way out with script to set camera distance to max)
---
This is one of those "no changes" things that should be reverted because FOV directly impacts how the pacing of animations feel and would go a long way to helping the already sad animation system we're stuck with.
---
You need to educate yourself on the word subjective, that is all.
---
I think this is an illogical level of mistrust to have with Blizzard on this issue.
---
They've demonstrated in the past that for issues like this they always compare with their 1.12 reference client/server.
---
So no, I'm not really going to question Blizzard on this one. I don't think it's reasonable to expect Blizzard to write up full on bug investigation reports detailing their internal testing procedures for *every single issue*.
---
When LFG was introduced, I was in a guild of friends I had recently made. We played into Cata, and I quit fairly soon after its launch. 
---
I came back late in Cata and went back to my first server, where my wife was and joined her guild. Very active guild then, and it was easy to get people for groups then and into Panderia. Guild splintered at the end of Panderia, and it became much harder to find anyone who wanted to group. At the same time, I got severely depressed again (lasting to this day), and basically haven't run dungeons since then (almost no Mythic in WOD and Legion, none in BFA) so I haven't really tried to make connections
---
Lmao yes. I have vivid memories of healing as an undead paladin, and it was amazing
---
I own a bakery, I dont play when I'm at work, but I play at home while the business is still open making money

The models for tauren and gnomes are actually smaller than what they appear in-game. In-game the player models are; Male tauren are scaled to 1.3.
---
Female tauren are scaled to 1.25.
---
Male and female gnomes are scaled to 1.15.
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Height](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Height)
---
Looks like it's exactly that, Blizzard had always scaled them from day 1.
---
&gt;The main problems occurred not from having BGs
---
 \&gt;Correct. Never said they didn't.   
---
But you did... It just contributed to "chipping away" at wPvP like you just said.  
---
BG's wont "INSTANTLY" kill wPvP, but it takes a LOT of players out of the wPvP world.  
---
You and everyone else will come to understand my reason for this post when classic launches without organized PvP, and then see how the game changes negatively when BG's are introduced.
---
Not ideal obviously, but playable. Quick reaction instant casts come to mind
---
#nochanges
---
tbh i kind of remember it actually being like that in vanilla!
---
ahh, that's too bad, was hoping it would be decent. I'm mostly just trying hard to make the mana last since Ele's dps isn't horrid, especially for not having any synergy debuffs, it just goes oom.
---
I was planning to use the pvp set, since it has spellpower while also having strength/agi, and stats get more efficient the more they're spread out which feels needed in a kind of hybrid build like this. Probably a 2h axe with a proc, so I could see if there were still some which scaled with spellpower or maybe even one that procced elemental devastation on a weapon proc crit.
---
This sub is astroturfing, you would be surprised how much marketing is in this sub. It's a very popular and cheap method of marketing nowadays, take reddit with a big grain of salt most people here are on a crusade if you go against blizz.

Common sense, in so much as it has been repeated so much on pservers that everyone is indoctrinated to think it is gospel. Literally the worst.

I remember my brother got my sister to play, and then later she got me into the game. This was about the time before burning crusade launched, and it was my first big mmo outside of RuneScape.

My name at the time was DrChode, the dwarf Hunter, and my spider companion was LittleCbode. Later lost my pet due to poor care on my part, and had to rename to jeffrina. Probably was the person who I chased around naked while /lick'ing her who reported me. 
---
My happiest moments were fishing up and down STV. At this point my brother and sister were both Max level and bugging my all the time to leave stv and join them. I think I stayed around lvl 39 for about six months because I simply found my happy place skinning gorillas and Crocs while also fishing for hidden treasures. In all the years playing games, it's hard to recall a memory that surpasses that.
---
So yeah, play your way, have fun, and don't have chode in your username :)
---
Hol up

They posted a screenshot of the reference client on the post about elite damage
---
I personally don't feel BG's affected wPvP too much in vanilla, there were always plenty of fights to be found around the world (&lt;3 LHC). I think flying mounts in TBC marked the true downfall of wPvP.
---
I wanna burn out on the beta, then take a break for a week, and play release. That would be ideal at least.
---
world pvp wouldn't be just ganking if battlegrounds weren't the main event for pvp.
---
It's not subjective.  Organized PvP is robotic, stale, and kills the world feeling.    
---
 Imagine if blizzard never implemented organized PvP but instead expanded on the WAR feeling of WARcraft.  The game would have been better off for it.
---
bruh that's a dranei, clearly tbc footage
---
I was a bit heated I admit.
---
Ulduar was very good, mostly just because it was innovative. No disagreement there. ICC was very cool. Those are two different things. ICC wasn't *that* good. B+ is generous. There were a few other great things about WOTLK, but the majority of the expansion is utterly forgettable. They abandoned too much of Vanilla and TBC design philosophy.
---
Sadly, I don't. But very likely the Gnome starting area.
---
lol @ not including mage in this list of elitists
---
Meme on Mel! Meme on!!
---
I watched Staysafe go into a fireplace and none of his party members could go in, including the cat Druid that was with him could not enter.  Gnomes can, and I assume anyone else would need Noggen or something.
---
Kiting a Paladin across multiple zones before finally killing him in Western Plaguelands. Basically, when I finally mastered jump shot as a hunter. Big game changer.
---
I never played OSRS. I think they should wait at least 3 years post Naxx to introduce any new content. Really let the players soak it in and then release content. Not every few months or w/e they are doing now. Let people enjoy being on top for awhile before adding more content to do.
---
Retail WoW can remain whatever its become, keep classic as an MMORPG and it will always have players. It is Blizzard, hopefully they will really turn this around and create content like they used to. They could easily experiment and create but do it on smaller scales. Dont do it for a whole expansion. Dont have a cataclysmic event that destroys the world and changes the entire game....
---
Experimentation is good but dont do it to make things easier and more accessible. Do it because it seems like a fun and challenging. 
---
It will eventually cease to be Classic because eventually Blizzard wont want to spend money on keeping it up. If its not worth the money then they will shut it down. If it does well enough then they will expand. Expanding content has proven to remain a point of interest for some players for almost every game out there. So if they want to make money off of Classic then they will expand. 
---
I'm Hoping they keep it as an RPG rather than a casino (and hoping they do new content and not TBC. though Im kinda of cool with TBC)
---
Flying mounts were a huge thing that also -chipped- away at wPvP.  
---
\&gt;I personally don't feel BG's affected wPvP too much in vanilla  
---
They did though...  It's easy to queue, play, re-queue, and avoid the world entirely, forever.  Most PvPers ended up doing that instead of PvPing in the open world.
---
&gt; AH is definitely not small,
---
The overall cut is small. You are just moving most of that gold from 1 character to another. That 200 gold you spend for the most part is now in another player's hand. Only about 5% is taken by the Auction House on a successful sell so that 200 gold only removes 10 gold from the world. Where people respeccing twice a week are removing 100 gold.
---
Yeah level Alts and farm gold are two great things to do other than pvping. Also raiding. Or 5 mans, or rep farming. There’s so much to do in this game, to just limit yourself to one aspect of it your asking to “run out of content” that way.
---
There is no world first for a 14 yr old game.
---
[removed]
---
By the way, is there any information/testing about the /camp reset used for DME? It's a p-server thing right?
---
When they announced layering, didn't they mention it would only he for lower level zones? If layering is supposed to be a holdover until the tourists leave, we won't need it after level 30 or so because tourists aren't going to make it that far. Right?
---
Private servers dont have correct damage numbers, the mob ai isnt as good as retail, whch we can see in the beta right now. Every private server team has said thatyve had to guess many of the numbers.
---
I think the appeal is actually partaking in the testing of a the game. So upon its release most the bugs are found and fixed.
---
oof
---
The video of the Tauren doing SFK in June 19 2006 was a day before patch 1.11.0 and was probably recorded a day or so before the upload. The damage values are spot on when comparing to the classic beta
---
You make some good points about your stance. But you can't take your opinion and present it as a fact. Some people agree with you. Others enjoy raiding most, or roleplaying, or battlegrounds, or controlling the auction house, or WHATEVER.
---
You can make the best points in the world, but when you attack people and claim that "my opinion is right and everybody else's is wrong," it's just going to cause people to ignore you.
---
The database page contains no news, guides, blue trackers (or ads) and includes a site map for easier navigation (many people are unaware there are different data types in the database) and a few comments and screenshots to highlight user contributions. All that other stuff is mostly below the fold, and the search box is front and center.
---
We've found over the years that a plain search bar is good for doing one type of thing, and is great if you already know what you're looking for...but really bad for driving attention to many other things people want to look up, like database filter pages, data tools, and other content like news and guides. Even back in vanilla, there were alternate layouts to the search box layout, such as Allakhazam which had news/site announcements below and a menu of options on the left-hide side of the page. Right now Classic news is a ton of traffic on Wowhead, so we wouldn't want to design a new layout that minimizes that--it's something that people enjoy reading, which wasn't the case back when the site only had a search bar.
---
We've designed the database page as a compromise for people that like the old-school style of browsing, while trying to add some database-related highlights for newer players that might need some help navigating around.
---
actual goosebumps came through! 
---
This gave me a such a big fucking smile and just proves that wow vanilla even holds to this day! Cant wait to see shit when stuff gets capped to 60! Damn i cant wait for this damn release!
---
They did say that the layer you join would he yours for the day. The tech we are seeing now doesn't match what their design for it is
---
apparently people are out there taking Forsaken so they can break fear in PVE encounters.  
---
In PVP it's obviously strong also.  
---
Orc: stun resist for PVP only basically.  
---
I'm going forsaken for the PVE edge
---
I remember this.  I thought Blizzard did mention it in patch notes.  Maybe not.  My guild raided a lot during that last patch right before TBC came out.

Yah that's simply not true. You can put 20 ilvl 450 people who have only ever done for in front of M Jaina for days and they wouldn't be able to down her
---
When standing at the highest point right at the entrance to the room you want to jump straight down when Herod comes charging for you
---
This is done to not take damage and maximize the time he spends chasing air
---
Themechanic didn't .. quite do that and ended up almost getting killed multiple times because he didn't just jump
---
I wish I could follow reddit posters, you'd be my first...
---
I remember that: /script JumpOrAscendStart() 
---
Used to make you fly for like 2 days before they fixed it. Not sure if that was the exact command but Vanilla had tons of fun things that popped up from time to time.
---
yes 1 week and people will be farming devilsaurs to the point where they have hundreds of devilsaur leather, despite it taking a minimum of 4-5days played to get to the point you can kill them, meaning in a week 90% of even the hardcore players wont be able to kill one. Not to mention this doesnt let you get infinite items, you can get 1 spawn per layer, which will be a few per server most likely. And thats if noone else on any other layer is farming those things.
---
When you summon someone, its usually cause you're in group with an objective. Since you need 2 other people to summon someone, you can't really make money off of it.
---
There are macros or add-ons that will delete extra Soul Shards. Its definitely a downside to the class, especially because you need to  farm a ton of them before raids as soul shards disappear 15 mins after being logged off. The mobs also have to be within your level range to get a soul shard.
---
Its definitely a pain, but its worth it imo. Warlocks are my favorite caster class by far.
---
This person is either trolling, a non native English speaker, or just ignorant. I spent like 30 mins trying to get them to understand that and they refused to actually read what I was saying to them.
---
Pretty simple to understand the difference between facts and an opinion.
---
I see what you mean, could very well be that way indeed.
---
Yeah I always say last year when referring to things that happened a couple minutes ago for the sake of the people reading next year!
---
So, I'm having a real dilemma. I can't decide between Mage or Warlock (the age old problem right?). I'd like to play an Orc (heart has always been in that race, and I dont feel like a warrior main again). I know I will also loose some racial versatility if not playing forsaken. 
---
I plan to enjoy open world/general PVP over raiding. However, raiding is important to me. 
---
My issue - I've never played lock before - I really like the idea of a pet class and am not a fan of hunters. I certainly feel more comfortable with mage, having mained mage from TBC-BFA off and on.
---
My questions:
---
Is Lock the right choice? 
---
Is the soul shard farm really the pain every says it is? 
---
Will I be more competitive/successful in PvP/PvE as a Lock or Mage (providing I dont act like a lazy peon in either situation)?
---
Any help, advice, experiences and general recommendations welcomed and highly appreciated. I dont have the time I used to, and want to make sure I'm investing my precious time into the right main!
---
I had a shaman tank my first ZF. went fine. They are capable tanks while leveling.
---
&gt;Yea they removed them in retail for that reason
---
as far as they push this layering thing, i don't think they should have it be the whole azeroth, it should never go past level 30 zones, and even that is pushing it, but i don't want to see high level materials being layerhopped and abused
---
Literally all people have to do is look at shit like Gurubashi Arena... Something that promotes wPVP is almost the literal centerpiece of the Classic beta.  Imagine MORE SHIT LIKE THAT.  That's what I want.  
---
It's not about my opinion or whatever.  It's about simple fact that organized PvP is bad for the game world overall.
---
Very useful for a first time warlock player like me thank you
---
This is correct
---
IMO if blizz wanted to make a change I think it would be a better solution to leave the cap at 50g but adjust the decay period from 1 month to 1 week so that constant respecs remain prohibitive but every once in a while if someone wants to pvp for a specific bg bonus weekend or needs to respec for a single raid it wouldn't cost 100g to do so and then spec back. Having said that I would prefer to leave it as is.
---
At that point just add respec. The whole point is to get you to commit to one spec, and if you don't want to it drains gold out of the economy. Its healthy for the server and the game in general. It really isn't that bad.
---
I haven't seen any info other than it doesn't work in the beta. So all of these farming response don't really mean anything until we get an answer on this issue.
---
Dsmn id like to work under those conditions. Lets see where my computer science degree will get me! Still need 1 year tho
---
This is just part of the retail client. You can change the nameplate distance with a CVar.

Fix it for PvP servers sure, but I really enjoy having it.

I learned who this guy was yesterday from sonii's stream. He stole a node from sonii and it was hysterical watching both of their point of views. This guy is a fucking clown, looking forward to watching him more.  &lt;3 Classic beta
---
You weren't just granted a best in slot, in essence the Artifacts actually replaced the grind for 1 or 2 BiS weapons with a grind for three BiS relics.
---
Ah really, I hadn't seen this. That's promising to start with. Though, what if a nerf happened earlier than people thought. What if it was in 1.10 along **with** the itemization changes? This seems pretty believable for the same reason I mentioned above, Blizzard would want new players to catch up in time. I just hope Blizzard has already taken this into consideration and its a non-issue, assuming a change was real at all.
---
That's a dwarven pub - it should be a dwarf female, shame on them
---
Thanks for not using the word “logic” in your response.  As I mentioned (literally in my post) it’s very improbable to have 0 casters (meaning mages) but the fact is you don’t have the math to determine the specific dps net gain/loss when comparing casters and MS dps warriors.
---
Your only available argument is to argue that MS warz are somehow categorically bad in a raid (which you indeed are trying to argue) however this argument leads to two problems:
---
1 anecdotal observations refute this, because pleanty of MS wars have been observerd clearing endgame content.
---
You don’t trust my observations (despite me having much more experience with vanilla then you) so:
---
2 your argument leads to an absurd conclusion.  If MS is not viable because their dps is “sub par” and they lower raid dps, then it would make sense to bring tanks, healers, and fury dps warriors exclusively since fury warriors are by far the top dpsers after bwl.
---
If we are min maxing specs, we might as well min max an entire class, if raid dps is the ultimate goal.  Incidentally, this type of reasoning would result in a raid with zero mages, and though I agree with you a zero mage raid seems silly, you offer no argument as to why it would never occur?
---
Modern private servers may be made from the ground up.
---
But the ones of old were actually much more true to the real game since they literally had it as a reference.
---
Anyway just look up some Guild group photos/screenshots from &lt;wotlk and you'll figure it all out soon enough
---
...you mean, the thing he did ON PURPOSE?

The real fail is falling for this streamers attempts to get views

Have you ever tried to attack someone in these cities?

So you're telling me because random troll tribes have patrols that they're more powerful than the goblin bruiser who protect the towns.

Lagforge
---
i think ret has a lower uptime, they don't have flurry, but yeah feral tank is not unusable and feral dps you need to abuse pummellers, world buffs and powershifting to be decent dps, and that is a whole lot of effort for middle of the pack, but if you really like druids and shapeshifting go for it.
---
Does anyone know if the terrain “jumps” are going to be fixed in classic or can we still do them? Been trying to find out watching streams but not many people know them very well
---
Yea i hope classic has oceanic servers other wise itll be a massive disappointment if you say playing at 300ms doesnt matter you havent played at a high enough skill lvl to notice its a problem
---
I have some news for you, for your point #2:
---
&gt; In PvP, Crowd Control effects will last no longer than 12 seconds instead of the full duration, with a chance of a heartbeat resist.
---
This is from patch 2.01, not from 1.12.
---
Dun Morogh
---
Vanilla is a big time sink but doesn't matter who you are you can't prioritize a game over real life responsibilities and relationships so definitely tell him to take it easy and keep the addiction in check
---
Mage is better but i don't agree warlock is necessarily harder, at least in pvp. The pet aspect of warlock isnt great in vanilla compared to tbc or wrath but it's still good
---
Priest!!! You’ve got shield, fort, flash heal, dispel magic, group heal... need I go on??
---
I wasn't arguing your point. I even said that you made a good case. I was just suggesting that you avoid saying things like "WPVP is literally the best thing." It can cause people to ignore your message, and say to themselves, "Oh, this person is just pushing their own opinions onto others, so I'm going to disregard what they said."
---
Again, you make good points, but if you want to have a discussion about it, you can't antagonize people.

---
Also removing parts of classic risks causing the game to die out if we're talking about keeping the game going a long for a long time there should be post vanilla content created and level cap raises but keep the same vanilla game design just with new content and abilities
---
I'm going with option for, hes a raging keyboard warrior.
---
That freaking song lol
---
Someone never experienced the difference between high end, top skill player, guilds colluding to keep casual bad pvpers from farming stuff.
---
What happens if one party has all the resources that are in demand? High prices. What happens if they have these resources in even greater numbers? They also progress at a much quicker rate.
---
Cool but wether you like it or not it's subjective, you do you though gl with all that.
---
If you have weird play times and want to raid find a guild before launch.
---
Personally, I hope they let some patches ride out longer than in Vanilla. Especially Naxx, which I believe was barely six months before BC got announced and people gave up.
---
Well, I just went on the site you linked on my phone. So it might be something you missed for the mobile version, because below the bar there is still a lot of miscellaneous content unrelated to the goal, imo. Latest comments, screenshots and there are still news posts (I see "new mounts in patch 1.13.2" and more).
---
The site map is fine. It's the extra content that loads in a lot of unnecessary extra data for things users might not want.
---
I get that news is interesting right now. But honestly, the database page should strictly be for searching. Let the news and other stuff be on the main classic page.

I never played private servers. I played the entirety of vanilla, from the week of release. I played gnomes. I played tauren. I fought one as the other, and vice versa.
---
Gnomes were smaller.
---
Well can you post those screenshots? All i've seen is private server ones.
---
Who know though, you might be right. It could be modeled off of some guy shouting out his name in /yell and the charging in.
---
You most certainly could see them, IF they were in LOS of someone on your team
---
i cant tell at this point if ur just playing devils advocate intentionally hard for a reaction, or if ur genuine
---
Alliance, I was Horde in vanilla so might as well switch it up. I want a Frostsaber and easy access to cute small pets cause racials ain't shit.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  That and all the dudebro idiots who think they're good at PvP will roll Horde because it's the 'PvP/Evil faction'.

I play female human

There's plenty of screenshots from real vanilla.

---
Really? Endurance is your racial of choice to give an example of an OP racial?
---
That's what I'm trying to do
---
Who else is going to say? 
---
Blizzard own the IP. Blizzard are developing classic off a 1.12 reference client.
---
Head out of your ass please. Pserver “developers” get nearly everything wrong.
---
If it was, it wasn't a blanket adjustment, or was completely undocumented.  I've read back from 2.01 to 1.10 and the only mentions of dungeon or raid changes are to the high level ones as individual tweaks to mobs and interactions.
---
Sell me on warrior bro
---
I’m pretty sure 5% is the correct answer, as far as vanilla tubing is concerned.
---
My memory on this matter is admittedly not 100% but nowhere do I remember the number 6 being associated with hit.  9% was for ranged, and white hits, 5% was correct for yellow.
---
Annihilation gauntlets is incorrect.  (I’m not going to give you the answer but the hint is there is an entire mechanic in vanilla that may not even exist on pservers. This mechanic makes a specific glove item BiS for dps warriors)
---
&gt; Our warrior got feared out of the map twice in one game lol
---
That sounds like Vanilla to me.
---
A moderate and reasonable opinion? I must be lost. 
---
Jokes aside, retail &amp; classic are different games. Comparing them to eachother is like comparing them to Diablo, or comparing Saints Row 4 to Saints Row 1. 
---
Retail is all about mechanical difficulty &amp; accessibility (eg scaling difficulty so shy noobs can know what Rag is like). Classic is about simplicity &amp; importance of time investment. Regardless of what r/**classic**wow says, it's a tradeoff &amp; neither is objectively better. You like retail? Great. You like classic? Great. There is objectively no reason for there to be a classic vs retail battle
---
Doesn't matter, they just put on their tinfoil hats and call it all a conspiracy, did you see them replying to the blue who confirmed Rhahk'zor's damage was accurate? Denial is going to be the theme of Classic.
---
My step dad got me into wow during vanilla back when I was in elementary school still. I remember begging him to play it and he finally handed me the instruction manual and said, if you read this fully over I'll let you create a character, and that night I read the whole thing (big achievement for young me).
---
One thing I'll always remember was getting a blue drop out of a chest and being so excited because that meant I could probably sell it on the AH and get my lvl 40 mount (finally!!). When I was in bed, my step dad literally got me out of bed because he told me the item sold, and said I could run to eastvale logging camp to train and buy the mount, and he let me ride all the way back to stormwind before I had to go back to bed (school the next day). Really looking forward to classic release as an adult now!!
---
The only thing i really dislike about layering is the fact that there are players on the same server that i play on and i might never interact with them. Like they are here but because he is on layer1 and i am on layer2 i might never meet people from layer1 unless i somehow get invited to their layer or they on mine. 
---
And at one point layering will be removed and just like that there are now hundreds or thousand of new players in my world that i've never seen. Instead of 1 or 2 good raiding guilds there are now 4 or 5. Just like that.
---
I know why they did layering and i understand that its probably the best solution to the problem but ye.
---
I don't really mind them. That being said i would really be in favor of you having to actually go to the BGs locations to queue up instead of queueing up in the capital. Its wierf that people are so against that idea when it comes to dungeons (me included) but they embrace it when it comes to pvp
---
You don’t say!!!
---
The 'new mounts' thing is a link going to a filtered list of mounts in the database, not news...although it appears to be broken so we'll either fix that or remove it. As the gaming landscape changes, the concept of looking up filters has become more antiquated, so the idea was to add nice images/links to filters to hype people up to use them. Shouldn't be news on the page except for the "news" dropdown menu.
---
Yeah, I agree. I was a huge BG fan back in Vanilla and loved how I could pop in and out of WSG and AV while I leveled. When I was tired of questing, it was a great way to mix things up. It was also nice to start learning who your pvp friends and enemies would be. It was a good bonding experience to grow stronger with the same people.
---
Classic existed just fine before BG's and would exist even better if they never existed and if Blizzard just expanded on emergent open world gameplay instead.
---
dude, you are insane.
---
You didn't mention play times. There are two big classic wow discords. Someone can link them here I'm sure.
---
*Skip to retail* literally oneshot from any spell coming from a guy 5000 times your health
---
I mean, I'm not even slightly convinced there was a nerf at all to dungeons during Vanilla. From all the footage I've seen of 2005-6 gameplay everything looks on par damage wise with the beta. On the other hand I'm pretty well convinced most people are conflating private server mob damage and reinforcing the accuracy of said damage with their faded memories of real vanilla.
---
The  next time I hear someone talk about “world PvP” I’m going to put a screwdriver through my temple. 
---
“World PvP” is just the term that PVP chads use to cover up that fact that they are “ganking” world PVP doesn’t exist.
---
I should have mentioned that too, I read through all of vanilla's patch notes one by one looking for any indication of something related to dungeon changes in this manner and didn't find anything either. Small tweaks like you said - yeah, but nothing major. But yeah, supposedly completely undocumented?
---
I made a 10 man strath aoe raid. 2 priests (one was me) and 8 mages. That was fun.
---
Then a Glowing Brightwood Staff dropped. As far as I knew then, it was the best item in the game because it was the most expensive thing I've seen on AH. I rolled a 100 against 9 other casters, equipped it and spent all of my money in ironforge on the highest intellect enchant.
---
So good.
---
1 piece of information isn't really enough to do anything. What (nefarious) people end up doing though, is compiling several years of leaked information and build a pseudo-"profile" of a person.
---
For instance, over the years, let's say you've posted your birth year (maybe even date), country/state that you were born, first name, marital status, financial situation, usernames, hobbies, job/career/degree etc., you've already got a nice chunk of info that could potentially be used as recovery questions, or even passwords or emails. 
---
Nobody is going to willingly give up all that info at once, so that's why people will dig through history and do that. It's popular in some other MMOs where real world trading is fairly common or security is lacking.
---
I'm not sure if they have dynamic respawn but lootable object respawns are WAY slower on private servers than they should be, which is why you end up with ridicilous screenshots like this: https://i.imgur.com/RWbDlgA.jpg
---
I called my dad just now because of this post. I remember now it was EverQuest that got him hooked! My dad a quiet man found friends there. I just learned today he still sent chocolates to a woman he met on there for holidays who met her husband through the game. I was more on the sitting and watching point with him then. Happy to share good memories of dads!
---
Its a classic :P
---
All the people saying Warrior/Pally are going to get kited into oblivion in WPvP.
---
Nice. 3/3 my accounts got selected for stress test but I only had an hour to play :/
---
I'm not arguing against you arguing, I'm just adding onto reasons why wPvP is better for the world overall.  
---
wPvP -is- the best thing.  It's emergent, it's real, it can affect other players in the world, it makes the game feel alive, it literally IS what world of WARcraft is about... I can go on and on.  BG's are just robotic grind-fests.  I don't see how people can disagree.  
---
I get that I come across pretty strong, but that's because this community is so "NOCHANGES" heavy that it is actually bad for the game.
---
Yeah, how dare people play a game the way they want to! If they don't like it my way they should just leave
---
I work most evenings. I'd say I still get 3 nights off each week. Maybe 4.

It's also worth noting the ability for Holy/Prot to AoE farm, in both DM and other places. All you really need is 13 points in the Protection tree for the shield nodes, slap on a Skullflame Shield or a Crest of Retribution with the Uther's Strength trinket, and just let a giant pack of enemies kill themselves on your shield and your Retribution aura while you heal yourself with Seal/Judgement of Light.
---
Wow OP sucks
---
It's 93 days!!??
---
That makes it sound so much farther away than "August 27th".
---
Even if you are comparing screenshots it doesn’t matter.
---
The difference In resolution, aspect ratio, and fov will make it seem different even if it’s the same.
---
It’s not “blatantly untrue”
---
I'm completely open to that possibility, I just want more info on the topic and maybe someone at Blizzard (the only people who can actually, truly find out) to look into it. I just want it to be accurate - no matter which case turns out to be true.
---
Thanks everyone lots of useful information here for the new (to classic) warlock.
---
Yeah lol, the countdown on the official site says 93 days
---
If you say world pvp didn't exist you never played vanilla.
---
Actually, the sheep that follow the herd are insane.
---
Hook me up ”cousin” ill suck your dagger ;)
---
My dad got me into Warcraft. He isn't a gamer by any means. But back in the day when I was ~5 he showed me Warcraft Orcs and Humans. I fell in love with it. I tell him "I still play that game where the characters say 'My liege' and 'Lok' Tar'".
---
I would rather sit in chat and wait a half hour than try to use a shammy tank. I'm going sham in classic and honestly wouldn't try to burden me team with this
---
You do have to go to the BG locations in vanilla.  
---
That however, still didn't make up for the fact that you could just queue BG's all day and ignore the world.
---
You know exactly what. Just try not to think about it.
---
Thanks for helping develop addons, not all of us are as hostile to quality of life as this sub is!
---
First, I will respond saying pvpers still went hunting for people to kill... pvpers are actually a very small part of the player base, far more players are about dungeons and raids holding true to what I said about no reason to actually venture into the world for them( them as in pvers)...
---
Also arena players still needed to go to places like nagrand arena for example to 1) create arena teams 2) queue for said arena... resulting to live wpvp action from what I said earlier. 
---
Finally I will say, as a pvper whose only reason to play the game was for pvp, in TBC you had actual arena teams where only 5-10 players were even allowed on teams to begin with... this means when your friends werent on you had nothing to do resulting in many pvpers ( myself for example) venturing off into the world to hunt people doing dailies because it was fun to find out how many I could fight on my own (1v5 was my max If I remember correctly) battlegrounds were only played to get geared up from previous seasons gear so you could compete in the game at all.
---
Hahah right.
---
&gt;So classic runs on an engine which has had thousands of changes since 2004/5 and yet they claim its correct? Yeah. No.
---
Yes, they say it's correct because they have an exact 1.12 deployment to compare to. 
---
&gt;Vanilla Private Servers are and have been running a vanilla client since 2006, using vanilla code.
---
No, private servers have not been using vanilla code on the server side, which is where the scaling of 3d models is controlled. They have pieced together a server implementation through a combination of data mining and guesswork, whereas Blizzard have an exact 1.12 deployment.
---
&gt; bnet friendlist
---
They've never said that BNet is true to vanilla. They've said that BNet is how they do distribution, authentication, account management, customer service, etc. nowadays and that it doesn't make sense to put in the massive amount of effort it would take to reimplement those things outside of BNet for marginal authenticity gain.
---
&gt;xrealm bgs
---
Those are by definition true to classic, they existed in vanilla. I'm not a huge fan of xrealm bgs, but they are 100% true to classic.
---
&gt; 1.12 class nerfs
---
They were always going to use 1.12 data. It doesn't make sense for them to do differently. For one, they have said they don't have copies of some of the earlier versions. And beyond that, it would be ridiculous to go through the work of painstakingly recreating 11 more patches worth of itemization and balance changes when they would only be used for a few months before going away forever. Private servers have had 10-15 years, and not even they are ambitious enough to try to do that.
---
That’s the way I’ve always played, and I don’t regret it one bit!
---
I do wish my guilds were more active and engaging, but that’s just one facet.
---
Well I WAS a try hard expert during vanilla (undergrad lol).  so maybe you should just accept the fact that, despite my memory being 14 years old, I know more then you on this matter. Furthermore, maybe you should question weather or not your pserver experience has indoctrinated you into an incorrect set of conclusions that you should shed for classic??
---
Filth
---
Neapolitan
---
Druid raiding was 90% clicking decursive lol
---
What I'm saying is based on past experience, all but two activities (leveling alts and farming gold) won't keep me occupied for that long.
---
If phase 3 is more than 4 months out, I will not have any productive activities left except to farm gold or level alts.
---
Did you also tell your friend to reroll?
---
Well.. I played a certain server back when classic was first announced and leveled a character for a few days. Then with the beta streams out, the hype is back and I have returned and lo and behold the server is still there and so are my characters. Probably  been over a year, that's better than what can be said for the beta.
---
That makes sense I just clicked through it quickly and wasn't really paying close attention to get to imp life tap. Thanks this all helps me understand the pve role a lot better 😁
---
There's more to gameplay than how many unique buttons you press per 10 seconds too.  That just seems like an arbitrary metric too.  
---
Classic's challenges tend to be in things like managing CC, Threat, Pulls, and Resources (health/mana/cooldowns).  Most of those aspects are lost from retail.
---
You do you, man.
---
What are friends ☹️
---
I’m saying “world PVP” just means “ganking” which it does.
---
I agree. It would be nice to play WSG or AV just because the games are fun. You don't have put in rewards or honor to encourage everyone. BGs can just be a fun game mode until you want to add rewards.
---
100 is not a problem, 200+ is a problem.
---
If you want to really compete, obviously any is a problem.
---
Mystery solved.
---
Hope this doesn't sound rude but, why do people care? Is it immersion or game breaking in some way?
---
Yea you are right. They aren't news posts, that is my bad. It just looked news posts. :)
---
But compared to how I want it to look like, which is is easily possible by blocking the elements with ublock, it is still far too cluttered for just a database page.
---
Here is a screenshot, but I assume you already understand what my idea is.
---
https://i.imgur.com/pcMTF2O.png
---
But he said hes going to be a NE so he shouldn't need darnassuss rep since hes already a NE and they can by default learn Nightsaber Riding? He would only need rep to ride Horses or Rams
---
What makes mage better in your opinion, I'm guessing DPS, CC and vendor?
---
Deeprun tram is the equivalent of the undercity to org blimp, not the tauren one.
---
If you enjoy PVP - wait for TBC to play as warrior. Instead of keyboard you will have piano.
---
Or now stay with me in this we keep it the way it is but just add in said open world gameplay alongside the bgs boom everyone happy. Just never add in flying, lfd, and lfr.
---
I wish you all the luck in making the content you like.  I mean nothing antagonistic. Unfortunately I will not be one of your viewers .
---
Yup look for a guild now.
---
"except if you're a ret pally you cant join my raids, but play the game as you wish"
---
Next you'll be telling me "the internet is for porn" wasn't done in 1 take.
---
Didn't they mention that they aren't messing with it and it will remain a 5 minute respawn timer at launch?
---
You blizzard shill!!! Who’s paying you to post this!!!!!  LFR is coming!!!!
---
but , that doesnt really sell my on warrior until tbc tho ?
---
Alliance. I used to play ret paladin in wotlk/cata, how were they in 1.12 for pop?
---
We aren't really obligated to chase non-existent bugs everytime some guy posts a screenshot from God knows where.
---
Trade secrets my boy, trade secrets.
---
I know my anecdotal observations “don’t matter” but the story is:
---
 I was top 5 dpsers for my guild (#3-4 as arms #1 as fury) and one of our warriors nearly caught me (he became #2) literally after he replaced glove slot.
---
I was pretty much full bwl+ gear (minus weapons cuz we were REALLY unlucky on warrior weapons) and he was wearing blues. He had the bis gloves and I didn’t.
---
here is a link to the WoW recruitment discord. They have Classic WoW all the way at the bottom.  
---
 [https://discordapp.com/invite/uen4J5h](https://discordapp.com/invite/uen4J5h)
---
They don't want dynamic spawn rates.  I think Ion talks about it when he explains layering.
---
They have a reference environment, as in an original vanilla server environment, which they can compare with. Classic WoW as we know is a new environment in which Blizzard are attempting to splice together their current systems with the vanilla environment.
---
&gt;&gt; seemed to have no effect
---
Sounds like it worked ;d
---
Im not agains BGs by any means but it is simply not true thaz if people like one thing they will do it regardless. Do players who not like flying mounts just not use them, do people who dont like the dungeon finder not use them if they played wo in the last 8 or 9 years? Of course they do. Sure people who dont like transmog wont use transmog but as soon as you're crippling yourself in any way when it comes to rewards and shit like that everyone will do that. I dont play retail anymore but i checked every expansion for a month or 2 except for MoP and i despise lfg, lfr, flying mounts etc but yeah of course i did all of those things because it would be dumb not to.
---
You do not in 1.12
---
I'm EU
---
IIRC there used to be a / command that would cap your level so you wouldn't level up past what you were currently at. Hopefully that's still there and wasn't a TBC thing so you can do this.
---
Oh and btw I forgot it was actually the wanted poster quest Dangerous! that rewards the bow, which is much better if that level cap command doesn't exist in Classic because you only have to do the one quest and not the whole Battle of Hillsbrad line.
---
Rag and Ony always dropped tier 2 (rag drops the pants), but the other pieces were a rare drop from MC bosses (though the loot tables were a mess with some classes missing tier set pieces entirely for both T1 and T2). In 1.3 or 1.4 they removed all the T2 except from Rag and Ony and moved it to BWL (which wasn't ready yet).
---
But...it's hard to say....since they aren't technically removing anything, just moving it, they might do it. However that's counter to their reasoning for not doing the Unarmored mounts, since they don't want people rushing to 60 to get something before it's removed (or in this case most of T2 removed in Phase 2 and re-added to BWL in Phase 3).
---
Without going back and looking at all the videos; if I recall, they only said that spawn timers would be "vanilla-like" and wouldn't be increased or sped up like on private servers.  But if this was in vanilla, I see no reason why it shouldn't be in classic, as well.
---
Ah, well that sucks.  I remember back in my day we had to WALK everywhere.
---
I'd be okay with that compromise.
---
They are only true in the sense they were added just barely at the end of vanillas lifespan.
---
They werent in phase 1 to 5. They should only be introduced in phase 6 if were gonna stay true to vanilla.
---
I have friends who got glad every season during tbc with 250-300 ms, one played rouge and it didn’t bother him much.
---
You can only track one of those two
---
ehhhh I've had some amazing skirmishes and guild v guild and random 50v50+ all over, many times.
---
Jeez. It was a joke. Settle down bud.
---
That's true, but now people are used to 10k nost mega pop starting areas so 3k is quite manageable in comparison if they didn't have the layers it would be just like how it was on nost pre-dynamic spawns.
---
how do the night elves get to stormwind?
---
I think that was more along the lines as globally increased spawn timers, but if the tech was in vanilla and only kicked in when then zone got overpopulated, why shouldn't it be in classic?
---
What because retail removed them we have to deny reality?
---
lol
---
Terrible design choice
---
So I wouldn't 100% rule out changes to the page, possibly those filter images, or comment/screenshots would go, but I'm not sure it would ever end up quite so minimal again because of the downsides it presents. We're also pretty busy trying to fix/improve the pages and filters atm, so any design revamp would probably be in the summer.
---
I appreciate the feedback, just trying to explain the thought process behind how that page was created in the first place and analytics that went into decisions.
---
&gt; spell batches
---
Heard of this, what exactly is it and how will it affect high latency players
---
Some No Changers are good. Some are horrendous, like the ones who don't even want a colorblind mode. And likewise, some Pro Changers are reasonable, and some are ridiculous. You know these ones - transmog, LFG, etc.
---
I'm just suggesting you take a different approach if you want to have a big discussion on the topic. Put out your details, and the reasoning behind them. Maybe simply SUGGEST that X event caused Y event to happen, rather than being so resolute about it.
---
I mean, most likely, none of this will matter - but you never know. I'd just hate to see good points (like yours) get tossed aside simply because of how it's presented, ie, "My opinion is a fact." People tend to take exception to that.
---
needs more system of a down
---
Yeah, sorry, I don't buy that. Like the others have already stated, Kern likes to take credit for a lot of things that were probably in the process of being implemented at some point down the line regardless. This is just a guy trying to insert himself into everything Classic lately as it starts to pick up steam.
---
"Everything you think is incorrect is actually correct.  Don't ask us why, it just is."
---
Thanks,

---
Gotcha this is what I was referring to https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8519-WoW-Classic-%E2%80%9CNot-A-Bug%E2%80%9D-List-Sharding-Bug-in-WoW-Classic-Beta
---
They didn't go into detail but hey maybe they'll have it at launch. 
---
I just expect to fail ton connect to the server for 3 hours and always be behind the streamers :)
---
Yeah and i know that the existance of BGs alone will hurt wpvp ofc but at least that way idk people could organize stuff and go kill the other faction at the entrance of those BGs, or on the way they would take. But how it is in 1.12 im a bit worried. Im thinking of doing exclusively pvp in classic and how different will that be than what i criticized so much in cata? I critiziced cata and stopped playing because i was never leaving the capital because i didnt need to,well if you do exclusively pvp in 1.12 you dont need to leave the capital just like in cata as well
---
They are the only class in the game that can tank raids. They are absolute monsters in pvp if you have a paladin or another healer with you, and they are arguably the best dps in the game with the right gear.
---
Glad I’m a rogue main.
---
Alot more, on it.
---
Bitch please if Classic was out this weekend your "lol" would fly out the window
---
I haven't got any of my owns sorry. Theres screenshots of the current vanilla beta vs current retail in this thread. They shouldn't be the same size.
---
I don't think it was in Vanilla.  I don't remember things spawning faster because more gold farmers were hanging out together.
---
Thottbot says hi
---
Of course it is. I played Vanilla and am thrilled to be able to go back. Having said that, I WILL NOT go back to shitty retail WoW. Everyone has their own opinions, and legit nothing u said is correct, just as nothing I have said - it's all opinions.
---
I refuse to play shitty retail, so at best I'd prefer some type of content, or even opening up BC servers with the option to swap and let us continue, although I prefer vanilla. I just know the same shit will get stale after being geared. Reddit can act like the majority of players want nochanges, but I can almost guarantee the majority that don't read Reddit would get extremely bored quickly.
---
&gt; The PVP Community/Server rivals etc wont even exist in classic.
---
I don't disagree. As I said, I'm not a fan of that particular decision.
---
I'm not 100% on this but I'm pretty sure that locks need stamina more than mages, because of life tap. +shadow damage gear is also god tier for locks but useless for mages
---
Yep the only reason I’m not playing Hunter this time around is because of that god awful dead zone I absolutely hate it for PVP.
---
&gt; Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.
---
I mean, in BfA, things respawn at an astronomical rate (a minute or less), so even if the overspawn tech sped things up by 10-20%, it would still be no where near BfA rate.
---
RemindMe! 96 days ”doo diss”
---
Also most of the boss values lineup with the old Prima Guide and that stuff was accurate for the 1.0 unreleased build that a lot of stuff ended up changed by the official 1.1 release.
---
the only dungeons to receive any big revamps were Strath and scholo and they actually made them even harder. (previously there were just a lot of mobs, but when they retuned them for 5 people they made the individual mobs stronger or more complex in preparation for the Baron 45).
---
A lot of the differences aren't dungeon nerfs, it's character buffs.
---
You are MUCH stronger in 1.12 than you were in 1.1, generally.
---
My ms during stress test was between 70-100 and I have satellite internet out here in the boonies. Was a lot better than I thought it would be, since last I remembered retail ran like shit.
---
I am sure a dozen or so players would not trigger it, but a hundred or more might.  And it may have only been in the starting zones too.  Mark didn't expand upon it after what he said in the clip.
---
Yes that’s all there basically will be to do until they release the honor system and BGs. Besides world pvp but with no ranking it’s just for fun. I’m mainly a pvper myself but love to enjoy every other aspect of the game besides hard core raiding(I do raid but it’s not my main focus I’m more of a filler guy.) I’m going to be using the first couple phases before the honor system to get my 2 characters situated. Or at least have one situated so I can full on pvp when it’s released. So that means I want to have my professions leveled maxed and hopefully be geared out in the BIS 5 man gear. Now to do that on two characters before the release of the honor system is going to be a very large challenge for the majority of the player base. The small percentage who play the shit out of the game 18+ hours a day and min max everything I have no sympathy for. Not a single game has been made to cater to an individual with an addiction issue such as that.
---
By taking the very long way to ironforge then taking the deeprun tram. The boat to stormwind wasn’t added until wotlk.
---
The [Internet Historian](https://youtube.com/watch?v=vvXRcwcIJh4) video is probably more comprehensive.

No that specific painting is 100% in Thelsamar in Loch Modan. Possible that more Dwarven houses has it though
---
Ah yes.  The glory hole.  It will not be missed.
---
To be fair, quest objects did spawn slowly in the earliest of days. Never like 5 min between—iirc—but certainly longer than 10s. 
---
I even remember being happy about that when I leveled my second and third characters.
---
Well that's just bs, did you mean feral?
---
Yeah it's a big bummer, even a bigger bummer that most people on this subreddit are for it.
---
It was not the only nail in the coffin.  There were several; although it was definitely one of them.
---
Exactly. Go warlock.
---
This wasnt completely removed some of them evolved into the climax of starter zones such as the tauren quillbore area. Some just became dungions later in the game.
---
Oh wow, I stopped in cata, but didn’t realize it was that long.
---
&gt; The social activity wont be any higher in classic than it is in BFA really.
---
It will be, among non-garbage players.
---
Bet you didn't even play real vanilla nerd. Go play with pandas
---
yooooo
---
I wouldn't necessarily get rid of battlegrounds, but I would make world PvP give significantly more honor or have separate rewards for the two. They're both fun to do and one shouldn't completely overshadow the other as battlegrounds currently do.
---
You literally have no idea what you're talking about. Private servers do NOT, and NEVER have run on vanilla code. Base model as in unscaled, btw. Don't talk so confidently about something you have no clue about.
---
Like the whole game?
---
I dug up a screenshot I had from vanilla. [Not sure it'll be too useful...](https://imgur.com/LI6qXgD)
---
I agree, some nochangers are good and have a reason to exist.  However, when the nochanges stance can be objectively destroyed with logic and math, that's when I have a problem with that mindset.  
---
Yeah, transmog, LFG, flying, all bad for the game/community/etc.  
---
I'll have to re-address this in a future post in a better way.  I just want people to be open to TALKING about it because I think SOME changes would be massively beneficial to the game.
---
the discussion started from :
---
&gt; If your server pop is high enough to need 4 layers, then the server economy needs 4x the resources of a single-layer population.
---
this implies that somehow the economy of the server will balance itself. from 15 years of wow we learned that's a wet dream that has no substance in reality.
---
so i said:
---
*no it doesnt because the number of ppl picking professions that require x type of resources is not a constant*(not following a pattern: for example on day 65 after launch a streamer will say tailoring is the best profession in game a vast majority watching his stream will do exactly that). *
---
then i've chosen a streched out example to prove that there scenarios where the his auto balance will not happen:|
---
*you can have everyone being a miner on one layer and everyone being herbalist on another for example, or everyone being a miner on 3* *layers.*
---
you're thinking in an organised pattern while communities act erratic because there will always be a *human* factor involved that fucks up the predicted path.
---
then you've said something like :
---
&gt; that there's no mechanism to make miners prefer particular layers over other layers, so they wouldn't congregate in one in particular.
---
so i said : yes, there are triggers that will change this (like the fact that you can invite your miner friend to your layer so he will be mining his layer, party with you and mine your layer, then leave party and mine his layer again and so on. known bug since they've introduced sharding and beta users said it is possible with layering too).
---
&gt; 'm not sure why you're bringing up excercises for students, that just seems like weird rambling. What were you trying to say with that?
---
i'm not sure if it was you or someone else that said: hei this isnt economy it's statistic!
---
so i was trying to say : the topic we're discussing involves both of them because statistic is useless without knowing the intricacies of the realm's life.
---
&gt; I'm not saying that only statisticians can argue about this stuff
---
not you but maybe someone else said and i compiled all and replied to you :) sorry
---
anyway i'm not even sure ppl want to discuss this based on facts but more throw dirt to each other. it feels like there's an overwhelming number of fanboism or astroturfing :)(not referring to you)
---
then would you sell me on warlock ?
---
I hope not!!!!! I love fresh™️... and I gave away 12g to some random person right before the server closed lmao... 😅
---
Man I had a 19 rogue twink in almost all blues and the best enchants possible, I think I spent over 100g on daggers and enchants but man one hitting every clothy was fun.
---
Wow no basshunter
---
[This is absolutely wrong, and there's video proof of it.](https://youtu.be/ipQBFDb_SFI) This is a TBC video of the Lament of the Highborne event uploaded 12 years ago, spawned from the Belf quest item in the Ghostlands. Sylvanas 100% had a Nelf skin in TBC.
---
I don't understand how anyone ever thought the original was real..
---
Like, did the guy calculating their chances actually sound like something someone would say, let alone actually do?
---
Adante is wrong, and I've provided video proof in my response to their comment. You remembered correctly.
---
Mage is just more consistent across the board. Mage is strong at all gear levels in pvp. Strong dps and cc in 5 mans. Decent dps from T1 through T3 in raids. Warlocks have spots where they're good and then lots of flat spots too.
---
It’s interesting that on private servers no one complained that gnomes were too small. Seems like, at least based on those screenshots, it would have been kind of noticeable. But without reference I guess one wouldn’t notice.
---
Dungeon, questing, professions, lore hunting and shooting the shit in world pvp at tarren mill.
---
Talk smack on top of ogg bank.
---
I liked a lot of changes in the Cata revamp, but 1k needles getting flooded was my least favorite thing they did. Destroyed one of my favorite zones and making 90% of it useless.
---
Iirc they have to be female to fit in. Even if they go in catform.
---
Six hours and no one's come along to condescendingly state you don't understand how layering works and you're an idiot for not understanding why it's necessary Because Reasons.
---
This sub must be slipping.
---
Sarcasm aside, I completely agree with you. Yes, without sharding/layering/whatever-they're-calling-it-this-week, Classic's launch will undoubtedly be a clusterfuck. Despite that, I've supreme confidence the game will not only survive, but thrive despite the growing pains. After all, WoW's original launch was also a clusterfuck and it went on to become the most successful MMORPG in the world.
---
If Vanilla and the folks who played and fell in love with it survived queues and server issues then, we can damn sure survive them now - not least because we're going into the experience knowing exactly what to expect this time 'round. Meantime, dealing with those issues will give folks something to bond over as we're getting into the game, reinforcing that community aspect which is the entire bloody point of the whole affair.
---
Blizzard's creating an additional problem where none need exist, then engineering a solution which is arguably even worse. Just let the launch be the beautiful mess it's going to be. Things will shortly sort themselves out just like they did the first time 'round and we'll all move on to enjoying the game none the worse for wear.
---
Not TBC. [This is a TBC video of Sylvanas.](https://youtu.be/ipQBFDb_SFI) She had the Nelf skin throughout the expac.
---
ah yeah, but I imagine after such a high adrenaline run their brain went numb at that time.
---
A dude made a famous brazillian version of it, its well known here lmao.

What a  pathetic pos you are.
---
Saw him tag the cyclonian elemental away from tips for ww axe quest. Was pretty hysterical.
---
More Linkin Park!
---
I think it may have taken me a month for my first sixty.
---
I did... and I really don’t want to talk about it.
---
"I stopped playing retail 2 days after TBC" 
---
Why do people like you spout utter bullshit in an attempt to seem like...What? A hard-core vanilla bean? It's fucking pathetic lmao.
---
Vanilla had thousands of people with good gear and they still prefered BGs, because they are just better, "gear" is just a poor excuse, even with full gear, bgs are better and it's not my opinion, it's the player base taste. You are just opinionated and imho kind of immature about it.
---
I totally agree. Desolace was one of my favorite zones and I havent leveled there since probably before cata. 
---
Im really excited to wander through the world without flying mounts, the world felt bigger to me back then.
---
WeirdChamp FeelsWeirdMan normies OmegaLUL
---
And because they aren’t fast at leveling.
---
And someone (you) never even looked at what the fastest possible vanilla leveling is. A warrior could play 18 hours a day for the entire 1st week and not touch a devilsaur. Your claim that just a week of layering will ruin economies is retarded, at week 1 each server will have like 10 dudes at 60, because yo not only have to do literally nothing but sleep and play wow for a week, but also have to be one of the fastest levelers in the game, to hit 60 in a week of real time.
---
Been on list 2 or 3 years, got invited to everything since being on the list but this.
---
I'd be okay with that, but I also would also want to have capturable bases or world pvp objectives to make wPvP more interesting.
---
In vanilla =/= it will be in Classic. Even if this magical feature (that we've never heard of until a man of debatable reputation mentions it in a stream 15 years later) existed, it would have to be in 1.12 to be used since that's the build we're using for our core systems. If it wasn't in 1.12, it's a no-go.
---
I'm a truck driver and sleep in my wagon thro the week, I always play whenever I finish with a wifi dongle
---
&gt;Do warlocks and mages compete for gear 100%  
---
Pretty much. Tier sets are generally very good for raiding, but outside of that yeah they all want +dmg/hit/crit. The main difference probably is mage gets a very easy 6% hit from talents while lock get none, so locks have a very big mission getting +16% hit for raiding cap, and pretty much need AQ/ZG gear to cap and start going decent dps, whereas mages can cap by BWL.
---
Yes, but what I am suggesting is at some point it might be prudent to not put 100% faith in the perfection of their internal version.
---
yep
---
I was a metalboi in middleschool if the playlist doesnt show that for itself haha I'll look em up.

Adante is incorrect. [Sylvanas was updated in 3.0.2, in October of 2008.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) Her Nelf skin existed through TBC, as further evidenced in [this video.](https://youtu.be/ipQBFDb_SFI)
---
Oh yeah I cover that in the guide lol Diamond Flask all the day friend =D
---
Your prediction is just that, a prediction. It’s more likely that the game picks up steam and has more subs 6 months after release than it does at launch.
---
Vanilla never took 10 hours a day to play unless you were going for high PVP ranks.
---
oh boy, people seem to hate streamers here for some weird reason.
---
I’m so ready
---
I'm glad they release the 1.12 version of items because at launch some of the itemization was fucking retarded.
---
Especially T1 sets which also had different visuals. I remember Warlock set had stats like 20 stam 20 int 15 spirit and +5 health regen. Not even bonus spell power.
---
I wish I could quit work and play classic.
---
Just looking at the phases, IMO... phase 1 should be relatively long and phase 2 should be relatively short.  But maybe a phase 1.5 for DM a little bit sooner?  I don't think phase 2 should last a long time because an honor system with no BGs for a long time is going to lead to some shitty situations, especially if they don't give enough time in phase 1 for the more casual but consistent players to reach 60..
---
Yes, but i respect their decision and that i did something wrong
---
No xp from BGs until wotlk

Also you are forgetting that collusion between factions will get you banned, its explicitly against TOS. Good luck stopping a dude from your faction from taking your devilsaur spawn on another layer without being able to make characters on the opposite faction on the same server, or without organising with opposite faction players like what happens on private servers, because youll get banned for it on actual vanilla servers.

This is the answer. 2 slots make no difference at all, not worth the drama. Free /roll for everyone.
---
in the right hands
---
I never saw old thousand needles. I can’t wait.
---
Thanks for the useful analysis - guess I'm going to really have to think about this more!
---
You don’t have to imagine it anymore, you can play it upon release!
---
Those are exactly my thoughts. I love every class except shaman, since I don't play horde. I'm all about swiss-army knife utility!
---
We don’t joke about classic wow. Classic wow is life.
---
Ugh yes. I remember having my shot or regular cast rotation macro'd.
---
RemindMe! 96 days "doo diss"
---
Done
---
It’s not vanilla without Chinese gold farmers.
---
My liege! Thank you for that reminder too. I remember fighting orcs was so bad ass! Argo was a lesson in the boss fights! There was another post on here that made me post this. Basically it was about not about leveling up so fast enjoy every quest and take the time to explore. That was my dad. Being a "gamer" he was fascinated with a just looking around at everything and enjoying it and it sucked me in too.
---
I believe in you!
---
I've always wanted that as well. The Outland objectives were a step in the right direction, but still lacked incentives to do them.
---
r/boneappletea
---
They can summon demons.
---
That's part of the vanilla charm. I'm sad they aren't doing progressive itemization - though I would have agreed to move it earlier like phase 2 or 3 instead of 5.
---
Get a subscription. Log onto you account on August 27th. Play the game.

Plenty of other people out there.
---
Currently playing a hunter on classic and this is so annoying. Gotta stay just barely on the sweet spot to make Swapping targets easier.
---
Man he's good... Pretty impressive the sort of stuff you can do even at level 30! Can't wait for release to see all the PvP at 60.
---
That's just textbook Quin content.
---
Salt.
---
He got his stream content out of the beta, probably could've played for a few more days but he's gonna switch to PoE Legion soon anyway.
---
Ret paladins got some serious problems in vanilla. Being bad in PvP is not one of them.
---
Yes, and they should remove it for this release too. There is literally no reason for it to be there besides objectifying women. By putting that image back in the game, Blizzard is implicitly supporting it. I don't care about "No changes," this needs to be removed. If there was originally an NPC who said the N word would you want it to be put back in for the classic rerelease for "authenticity sake?" Certain things need to be left in the past. Racism and objectification of women are definitely those things.
---
Do you have any guild or group from either retail or another game making a guild on classic? Maybe people in your circle of friends has a guild ready to join, that’s the first place I’d look personally .
---
Nice.
---
Amazing game. Absolutely amazing game.
---
They're WORGEN mom you don't understand, I'm not a furry they're just werewolves
---
So, I made a discovery in the beta. not sure if this is known yet...
---
The talent improved firebolt works properly. That might not sound like anything special, but it was broken all through classic, including patch 1.12
---
I can't see this make a huge difference at endgame, but it does allow for some fun leveling builds with improved imp from demonology and destruction talents. The imp actually puts out a lot of DPS with this talent.
---
I'm not wrong, it was reverted to the original with the release of TBC.
---
Saw the same thing but right before I left to work so the whole day i was wondering if i actually saw beta access. Oh well at least I got to play couple hours on stress test.
---
BG's are just another example of "I WANT IT NOW" mentality that ended up killing WoW in the long run.
---
It's not that it's hard to come by, more like it's worth a lot more.  If you knew what you were doing you could make lots of gold, but it's not like modern wow where you can get thousands of gold by doing a couple world quests.
---
Did they fix the rez trick with MD/DS builds? I remember being able to sac my pet while a healer spammed the rez button and I could get the buff and my pet (plus MD if I had it spec'd) at the same time.
---
I was in a layer in Stormwind with 200 other players and nothing was happening around us while Asmongold was fighting Hogger and VanCleef in the same spot on stream.
---
My group layer-hopped for some reason while I was in the Ban’ethil Barrow Den in Teldrassil. I got aggro from 4 mobs that came out of NOWHERE on top of us, and I died. Had to run all the way back, took 4 min. Luckily they were super nice and waited me to return. Definitely would suuuuuuuuuuuuck if that happened often after release... seriously NOT FUN to die from something that is not your fault and happens randomly.
---
Layer-hopping is a BIG problem if it happens to you deep into a non-instanced dungeon, or around a lot of mobs in general. Even if it happens only once a week, that would still become infuriating very quickly.
---
they are, but they're not supposed to be seen from more than 10 yards away
---
As far as I know, the only weapon that would make you want to switch from dual wield on alliance is BRE from Ragnaros.
---
Given the sudden increase in random twitch chat and toxicity in general, i would say the F&amp;F invites have started going out.
---
its almost like the games going to be hard! Oh no!
---
this
---
it was only like 7 days long though
---
Installed. Hadn't in the past but I realize that beta is more scarce this time around.
---
Roles weren't added until the Wrath version of the LFG Tool.
---
The TBC version you could type your role or other info in your Note, and people checking the find more section could read it.
---
During Vanilla the dungeon queue could make you some PRETTY strange parties, since it didn't give a crap about what your spec was, just that you could potentially do the job. Now they supposedly refined the algorithrim with it, but my only real experience with it was getting a group of 2 priests, 2 mages, and a rogue for deadmines
---
People that don't watch Quin on the regular will probably not understand how normal this is for being Quin content. Classic wow cucks.
---
I remember this way more in TBC and never heard anything about it during vanilla.  Granted I’ve never played a Paladin before and the general population got far better at the game from Vanilla —&gt; TBC.  So many it was a thing in vanilla.
---
Can anyone play beta?
---
Honestly it could work. Because phase two is not a real raid content, simply the world bosses and DM you could shorten it and make phase 1 and 2 about 6-7 months total with phase 2 part only about a month long. Then once 3 comes in you can go back to 6 months per phase and not really have issues.
---
It was either wow tokens or gold sellers.
---
Just find a gold seller.
---
Auctioneer has existed since vanilla and existed for most of it iirc. Curse says Auctioneer was already on v. 3.4.2 for the 1.12 client. The actual auction house functionality itself has virtually never changed, which is kind of pathetic, honestly. Not sure if the API for how addons are allowed to talk to it has changed.
---
Ty, ill look for it.
---
It's possible they're that too.
---
One back and forth with them went like this:
---
Me: "It's not hard to understand the difference between opinion and fact."
---
Them: "Clearly projecting here."
---
Yeah I guess I was projecting that they weren't a dumb ass and understood something simple about English. My badddd
---
Chill.
---
To me, TBC was really kind of peak-WoW.  Maybe that's nostalgia IDK, but I had more fun in that xpac than I did in most of vanilla, and certainly more than in WoTLK or further on
---
thanks! really appreciate it. There are so many quests that we'll only get data from if a certain class/race combo submits data...between that and the limited beta, every upload will make an impact.
---
Ah so you consider this over-edited, got it!

You have no clue about any of this.

If you did why arent you working at blizzard? You're clearly a self proclaimed expert no?

I mean everyone else is wrong but you? You're just bootlicking blizzard.

vanilla servers literally had vanilla retail as a reference for scale.

If you're alone, either in world pvp or solo queuing BGs, Hunter is ten times better. It's not even close.
---
If you're in a group / have a healer, warrior becomes really strong too.
---
&gt;Being bad in PvP is not one of them.
---
i mean... melee with no interrupt, movement abilities, or snares is pretty fkin bad at pvp
---
What's funnier, is he's probably just going to roll an enhancement shaman, another shitty auto attack class.
---
If you want to play meta 1v1 classes that push buttons you need to play mage/lock/rogue/hunter.
---
I.... can’t tell if you’re serious.
---
someone never learned how fast warriors can actually level, and that these people don't level solo lmfao.
---
“Did they address anything-“
---
Wtf

still 13 days to go

Could even make a macro to lag yourself out but you'd keep moving on other people's screens.

And spam it.

Cheesy AF but useful for those games of WSG when it would be a 10 man turtle in the flag room and the game would go on for two hours.
---
Oh there’s plenty of racism in this game too. No orcs allowed on the Alliance side? No night elves browsing the Horde AH? That is blatant racism. I don’t care about “no changes”, we need to be inclusive of all races and people. Except for the gnomes. They can go back to Gnomer.
---
There is no way to address it.
---
It was pretty OP.. far more so in TBC tho I guess.  That’s why it eventually got nerfed.
---
true dat, i 'member auctioneer seems to have been around forever..
---
TSM is another thing, though, i think. that's a killer add-on. looks complicated but i learned some basics from it..
---
yeah the auction house itself blizzard keeps saying theyre gonna fix it, maybe we're close to that, since they've been saying it forever. remember appear offline haha

Okay Warlocks, talk me out of being a Hunter. I have it narrowed down to one or the other and it will probably come down to faction (Hunter for Horde, Gnome Warlock for Alliance)

Have you seen the male character models? Should they be slimmed down because they objectify men with unrealistic body standards?

oh I didn't realize. Good luck!
---
I agree. He comes across as an attention whore.
---
They will still see you stealth.

I’d bet you dollars to doughnuts he bought the item just so you could have your mount.  I bet he was horde that sneaky bastard.  How does it feel knowing that your endearing stepdad was a dirty lying cheat. /s

You can go as 10 to LBRS but won't be able to complete quests.
---
I mean, you don't play them like a warrior or a rogue. If you know what you are doing and use engineering, then you can do pretty much anything you want. They suck at wPvP, but in duels and BGs they are fine.
---
Weaponsmithing gives very little that is actually worthwhile. In vanilla axe smithing with arc reaper pattern was quite profitable, but with the relative ease of MC and knowledge of player base, as well as weapon speed normalisation, arc reaper isn’t that desirable anymore.
---
Armorsmithing can get patterns for lionheart helm which is almost BIS all game, and later on can get titanforged leggings pattern which is BIS.
---
speaking as a hordie, Iron Forge has the best aesthetic, best layout, and feels massive while not being a pain to traverse. Also, can't beat the deep run tram
---
i wish classic only had 13 days to go
---
I don't know if it WILL affect us... common sense tells me it will.
---
It's basically the frequence at which the server processes the actions performed by the client.
---
In classic all actions performed 250ms or less from each other, are considered simultaneous which leads to some weird interactions. However in retail this window is much smaller... I think I read it's about 20ms... so anything cast outside that window is not considered simultaneous... 
---
That's the best I can explain it with my own words, here you got a link at a blue post

I want to help test this game I’ve loved for do many years. We’re finally getting it and I just want to be apart of the people helping work on it.
---
We can agree to disagree, but I would bet money that the population peaks the first three months and then will taper off before finally stabilizing.
---
I'm not saying it would harm classic (after all TBC was vanilla but better overrall tbh).
---
I'm saying it's outside of the scope and incompatible with the goals set by blizzard themselves.
---
People have been embelishing vanilla for ages and as someone who didn't experience it i'd like an experience as close to it.
---
One thing that the not no change crowd ? or rather supplementary content, "buff damage from mobs so it's harder like we remember", add this, remove that, so on and so on joins what Brack's condescending statement "you think you do but you don't", a lot of people have an idealised version of vanilla in their memory and would like to re experience these memories which you can't, you can emulate them though.
---
I'm not saying vanilla won't be enjoyed either but over time either due to forgetting things along the way or private servers doing things slightly differently, the vision of vanilla was altered and having classic coming as close to it with most of it's faults and good points is the best thing we could have I think.
---
And hopefully it helps the development of a better retail version.
---
In short, the point is not that new content would make classic not good but rather that it wouldn't be what it was, it would be your idealised version and i'm pretty sure lots of people have different versions (just read the AV debate over which version people prefer). It begs the question, what do you actually want, vanilla or a vanilla like game which I think is more of the latter, retail having done a poor job in later expansions (despite improvements in other areas) in filling the gap left by the older versions that were unplayable and slowly put on an ever growing pedestal.
---
It's a script they using and that's why they can see it.  
---
(/run SetCVar("nameplateMaxDistance", 80)
---
Then it's incomplete. They are right that it got changed back to #2 during the WotLK beta. However for a few weeks before BC dropped that model was in the game. I remember everyone running to undercity to get a first look at the new blood elf models. No idea why it was reverted with BC.
---
I actually love the introduction of bgs for the reason that it killed wpvp. wpvp is fun while you level, against similar numbers, levels and geared players groups of 3-5 ppl framing you at level 48 when they are 60 in pre raid bis is not the best pvp experience.

I'm amazed at how many people don't know about sit macros. It's a godsend on PvP servers to escape would-be gankers.

Omar had a grow buff on him. Probably a spell effect that was applied. I bet they only did that so they could easily figure out which layer they were on based on the streams.
---
I’m going to be fairly casual but will still level to 60 and do both PvP and PvE. How much of a pain is the soul shard farming? Would I be better off going Mage?
---
Even though I am not an Asmongold fan, and hate reaction video content, this was hilarious.  Quinn's such a spaz, lol
---
Good ole thelsamar.
---
I don't know what these guys are talking about. Auctioneer was relatively primitive. You had to stand at the AH and scan it page by page on the regular, this took about 20-30 minutes. That's what got you your sell price estimates. It wouldn't list things for you or buy things for you, nothing like the auction house add-ons today.
---
I had to do this 18 hours a day to get R14. And in AB I was stationed at stables all games. There was barely any PvP involve.
---
I agree I think 50g respec costs is going to do way more harm than good.  I know a lot of people are on the no changes bandwagon (I am too for the most part, I want to have an authentic vanilla experience), but we have look at the consequences of having a 50g respec cost.
---
It will deter people from playing other specs, which will deter people from playing other aspects of the game, which will cause people to lose interest and quit.  I think we all want vanilla wow to be successful, a 50g respec cost is going to cost players 100g per week if they want to swap between in a pve (raiding) spec and a pvp spec.  Now some people have already mentioned that you can play some sort of hybrid spec that is “ok” at pve and “ok” at pvp.  I personally don’t see this ever being accepted but we’ll see. 
---
 
---
I think most raiding guilds will require their raid members to play the standard cookie cutter specs.  For some classes like mage there really isn’t a good hybrid spec to do both, if you can think of one let me know but for pvp you’d want to have perma frost / frostbite / shatter / iceblock, that takes up 15 talent points, at this point you might as well just play a pure pvp spec.  It’s pretty much the same story for pretty much every class.  Long term players are just going to go with the pve specs and raid log (vanilla raids don’t take much time to clear, maybe 1-2 nights per week).
---
Now I’m sure a lot of people don’t view this as a bad thing.  Maybe the game should be more grindy and require people to farm 100g per week to do both pvp and pve.  The issue I see is that most players probably won’t do this and we’ll just see a decline in the game.  Now I think right now is too early to tell,  we should wait and see first, but if people are not respecing and pvp is dying then I think blizzard should take a long look at this type of suggestion.  At the end of the day I think we all want an experience where the world feels alive and BGs are active and people participate in all aspects of vanilla, I just don’t see this happening with the 50g respec price but I guess we should wait see first.
---
So it would really depend if I'm looking to make gold or further improve myself.
---
Thank you.
---
Haha right 😂
---
Err, this is a joke right?
---
get off of my screen vile horde
---
Good. Hopefully that cuck is gone for goood
---
That guild sure brings me memory...it was the top Alliance guild on Arthas server, good stuff!
---
I wouldn’t worry about finding a guild before classic launches. Once you’re in game, there will be lots of guilds to join.
---
Soul Shards don't disappear. They did originally, but that was patched out in like 1.3, and we'll have the 1.12 versions that last until used.
---
Unlike those issues blizzard has stated clearly how layering will be used and what for. This obviously falls outside that intended use and should be addressed.
---
I remember when the pre-TBC patch dropped and that *didn't* happen, and I personally bitched about it in General chat because I was bothered that they had such a good opportunity to update Sylvanas's model and yet ignored it. So one of our memories is incorrect. But I have patch histories and video documentation to supplement my memory, sooo...
---
Worth to point out that you probably won't be tanking much in AQ for a while for the reasons you brought up with gear. Also alot of the items you want are desired by other classes that usually have prio over you.

If layer hopping isn't fixed what's stopping me from randomly getting invited by guildies at a black lotus spawn point and getting easy money?

The changes side of r/wow has definitely tried to hijack the discussion more than once. I don't post much here, only to log in and interact with this sub, occasionally. It's a pity imageboards have been garbage since 08 but that's the way of it.
---
Right, but in world pvp you don't want to have to be stealthed 100 yards out just to close the gap without a nameplate alert. That's a long walk for slow stealth.
---
You don't use CoC or Fireblast, you'll blow all your mana on boss fights and usually not in CoC range.

The latest version of Advanced Interface Options works in Classic; this allows you to set it to maximum (as well as the camera distance).

Every class that does physical dps in this game will have the same two items on their Pre-Raid BiS lists. Devilsaur Leggings and Devilsaur Gloves are craftable by Leather Workers and require Devilsaur Leather to craft. There will be plenty of leatherworkers out there to craft the pieces so its not necessary in this gold grind, but you would need skinning and the ability to kill elite devilsaurs in Ungoro Crater. Hunter is the best class for doing this because they can easily juggle aggro between their pet and themselves along with some kiting to kill these mobs, and so for phase 1-3 they are the most profitable class in the game. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk

Screenshot is from Kharanos in Dun Morogh.
---
So, if I dont have exalted with darn, only with IF, I will be able to run the IF mount and the winterspring  frostsaber?
---
I would say get instant corruption (5 pts in affliction) and then get shadowburn from destro, and then go back into affliction for nightfall. 
---
And then like I said choose to go further in one or the other. I think finishing affliction is the better choice, but getting ruin from destro can be pretty fun.
---
Here is a 60 spec. I don't think this is exactly what 60s use, but it is reasonable enough.

All that said, sm-ruin is not free from drain tanking. It procs your instant shadowbolts so its a good spell to use if you aren't able to just hardcast shadowbolt

AQ Mount is unique on a server, other mounts are so rare that you can find it in the first 2 years maybe 3-5 times. So yea, there are some very rare mounts
---
Blacksmithing in general won’t make you much money, nor will he items you make be very useful for yourself. There are a few useful end game items it makes that are BoE so anyone can buy them anyway.
---
yeah. If it's a dungeon group and everyone else is running and I don't have the FP, I expect everyone else to run.
---
If it's a raid setting, our RL wouldn't even let you bid on loot if you had to be summoned at raid start (you were expected to be there and ready to raid, just like everyone else), barring mid-run replacements.

That's still a lot of health stones though.

That said a raid will usually have at least 4 warlocks, so it's not THAT bad split across 4 people. And you can make a pretty reasonable argument that the raid help supply you with a Core Leather Bag as soon as someone gets the pattern to make it.
---
I haven’t burned out in years. Don’t think I ever will.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I guess when you play POE hardcore and you get your character erased after the first mistake, deleting one in wow does not feel much.
---
You are right. I totally forgot that.
---
Most mounts in classic that are grinded for, you’re grinding reputation with a respective group. The mounts are somewhat rare only because most players don’t put in the massive time and effort to get exalted reputation... such as the Winterspring frost saber mount... quite rare because it’s a mission to grind it, taking weeks.
---
Neil Howe also seems to use Gen Y and Millennial interchangeably.
---
When there's only classic its not a previous expansion, no? I thought we were talking about Classic.
---
I think I remember having a macro for that
---
No, individual totems.
---
Originally you had to select them all individually, not sure if they changed it with 1.12 or not.
---
Haha rip those guys then.
---
And you’re just as salty
---
I mean, just because it’s a negative memory doesn’t necessarily mean you are still salty about it. I find its best to learn from those memories rather than try and forget them.
---
They still built the entire backend from scratch. Unless someone *stole* the blizz server source from them they can only backward engineer from a black box. This is very tricky and error prone.
---
There's nothing left to do on beta anyway.
---
Got the content, the subs, the views, move on to a better game
---
We've got a good amount of overlapping, I'll be harvesting from this.
---
Tier 1 fell over in vanilla with the sole exception of the (intentionally?) unkillable version of Ragnaros. Conquest killed most of those bosses in a single day like as soon as they had a real raid together.
---
The best!!
---
I'm certainly not claiming to have patch notes, can't blame anyone for not believing. Tried finding a video of it from that small week of time in vanilla, can't. So it's whatever. I certainly stand by what I said though.
---
There's a stickied recruitment thread on here every Monday
---
Expecting??
---
That's what I'm HOPING for. That shit show is something you only ever get to experience once per server launch. It's memes and shared misery.
---
You just need to get 3 people that you know are on 3 different layers, really easy to do, they keep inviting you in a cycle, they always stay on their layer because they are not getting invited to another layer.  
---
AoE clear a group of mobs, hop onto the next layer, repeat.  
---
This makes spawn rates for you esentially 3 times as fast and all you need to do is accept invites from friends who don't even need to be near you they could be out questing and invite you every 1-2 minutes.  
---
Imagine if there are 10 layers on your server, you just get 10 friends/guildies who you know are on different layers and do the same thing. It's trivial to abuse.  
---
Go to the spawn point of a black lotus, ask guildies to randomly invite you and you might find a layer where there is one spawned or any other high value node.
---
Man this sub sometimes. Its a joke lmao. He said he was gonna delete his char if the alliance would lose the battle for gurubashi. Chat was spamming delete for several minutes before he went offline.
---
Ok I'm out of the loop here.
---
Who is quin?
---
Why did he delete his pally? He seemed salty.
---
I get the impression he's done something like this before?
---
but that's what everyone did before PVP got more integrated... and it was an awesome experience! It won't last forever but the true Vanilla experience had that for a little while
---
Don't mind the downvotes. The truth hurts. The West's culture is a shitshow at the moment.
---
Because your opinion of world PvP is just that, your opinion, and some players prefer the organized and more competitive nature of BGs and Arenas. My opinion is that There’s way more room to express skill in instanced competitive PvP, and it can truly about who’s the better player. World PvP to me is just a gankfest of salt and rage, and those huge southshore vs tarren mill fights was just a zergfest that people did just for the fun of it, it didn’t give me any joy.
---
Moving pvp to an instance or to a zone somewhere out in the world is the same thing.
---
I played from patch 1.9 to BC release. The only dungeons I remember being hard were pretty much any level 60 instance. All the leveling dungeons were always easy to do and required minimal CC. I remember UBRS being difficult because you could not CC the dragons with a hunter who knew how to double trap. Scholo was also difficult as well as UD and Live Strat. People never really did DM as the others but most DM instances it was very easy to get lost and it took a long time to clear.
---
Whenever my guild group would run into the horde group that was grinding out High Warlords they would instantly 10 man turtle us because we were all full Tier 2 or higher and they only had PVP gear.  I'd just say over team speak "just stay in our flag room, I'll be right back with the flag".  5 minutes later I'd cap it and they'd all be like "how the fuck do you do that?". I never told them about the lag macro.
---
I believe you can still find one at Ravenholdt Manor.
---
Could have just tried being an annoying unkillable holy paladin.
---
i remember reading something about tje onyxia raod wipe guy
---
i thought that was how the guy actually was?
---
ah thats interesting cause by all we know you should die there. Some priorities seem not to work as intended.
---
Theres even a blue post describing that certain example saying you should die even tho the heal got through.
---
Those don’t exist
---
There aren't a thousand needles. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
---
The anniversary MC raid showed vanilla raiding was harder than LFR. It's probably the same difficulty as normal raids but with 40 people.
---
SO like what, he didnt do well in PvP and deleted the char? Not really understanding this
---
They could definitely make side the raid adjacent to a raid like aq.
---
One of us
---
I switched to horde on BB in tbc. Still there...
---
Your poorly drawn meme poster misses the point by a large margin.
---
I thought the chat was the thing here 😱
---
That came in TBC I'm pretty sure, possibly WOTLK. Definitely not vanilla
---
Gear is more important, just be sure to update your ofset constantly, and you will learn in no time, stance dancing you can skip it entirely if you want to do 5 mans, just charge tc or rend then change to defensive and stay there keeping sunder armor and rend up, revenge when its up and finally cleave(aoe) or heroic strike(single target) with excess rage.
---
That's actually a super good point.
---
On topic of Vanilla Video's, who remembers this Gem?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUwDAxVELAE&amp;t=159s

I didn’t think it was possible to make PvP videos I’m Classic where a player takes on more than 1 enemy “because everyone is so much better these days”. 
---
Rofl.
---
The BGs didn’t give exp
---
Lol this reminds me of trying to get footage of our attempts and realizing that so many of our healers had to face a wall or away from the boss to avoid lagging out from all of the spell effects. ROFL, good times. Some parts of Vanilla can never be replicated.
---
I might take that Mon/Tues off from work, but that's it. No rush as I'll done this before. The servers won't be stable until the weekend anyway.
---
added wotlk.  tbc added (in 2.3?) a visual of each below your unit frame to keep track and even kill them.  also gave you a spell to recall all current totems 25% returned mana but the presets weren't until wotlk
---
While fucking leveling 
---
Takes a long ass time and you will meet people that meet people that's how many guilds start
---
It hurts your argument when you write things like vanilla code. Private servers have never had the vanilla source code available to them, which is why it took over 10 years to even get them to the state they are in today.
---
Yes, people were referencing the vanilla client/server interactions, but that doesn't mean any of it was accurate at all. In regards to gnome size there is less likely to be errors but you really need to stop saying that private servers ran on vanilla code, it's completely baseless.
---
LOL WHAT A GOD
---
It's true ret paladins do suck
---
I'm pretty sure there are no dwarf women. Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground
---
He's an idiot. This is the same moron that made a character called Quinsex for an official Blizzard Tournament. The 69 in his name stands for his IQ
---
Shadow Oil got tested on Beta to scale with 0.56%
---
...???
---
1.12 classes makes a huge difference. 
---
Prior, you had paladins had to waste mana by spamming buffs, chain heal didn't target people lowest on HP, Warriors didn't have the buffed blood thirst or shield slam, Mages didn't have Winters Chill. There is tons more...
---
He talked about not liking Ret gameplay at the start of the stream, I think he's rolling a rogue come tomorrow
---
Short answer: no.
---
Long answer: after install, the game will attempt to update, then download and install the bnet app, which will insist you login with a bnet account. Once done (and you have access) it will download the modern classic client, in all likelihood totally ignoring your vanilla client.
---
No idea why you're getting downvoted. The screenshot from the beta and one from retail clearly show the same size model. 
---
This isn't even an argument about gnome size. The test client they are using isn't 100% accurate. They can't give a single inch here because they don't want everything to become questionable.
---
Nearly got divorced from playing too much Cataclysm?
---
Bruh...
---
1. Cataclysm wasn’t worth the subscription, let alone losing your wife over.
---
2. He gonna be single as fuck after classic releases.
---
Sure getting ganked by 5 ppl at max level whit good gear 10 times every hour while you are 48 is the very best thing about classic. Wpvp is only fun if it is an actual chance of an fair fight. I never understood the joy of killing ppl that have no chance of killing me
---
Hi, /u/MikeSFab
---
You should.  I played vanilla.  You just have rose tinted goggles.  The balance whine is going to be A-MAZING.
---
The thing is I'll actually know what I'm doing this time, so I've got several solid sources of income planned out ahead of time and I know where to BiS gear so I don't have to throw away money on a Krol Blade or something.
---
actually he said he disliked ret, because of the low/non existent skill ceiling, and in the past mentioned he wanted to try out rogue, so I think that's what he is going to roll next
---
Why do I distinctly remember it being five discs?
---
Thankfully there are other options.  
---
The people they are targeting for classic don't care.  Look at all the tens of thousands of viewers on twitch.  Most of them played wow with sharding.  They're just trying to recapture players that have unsubbed and prevent future unsubs from retail, not true vanilla diehards.  Shading is not going to be removed, ever.
---
Playing the meme specs past mc/ony will be reserved for competent guilds. To be viable as the shit specs, you have to put in more effort. Casual guilds won’t have people willing to put in the out of raid time to be viable. 
---
But you know if scholomance, brs, strat, brd, and dm are where you want your stomping grounds to be, then play whatever you want.
---
Here’s a Guild Recruitment discord specifically for Classic WoW: https://discord.gg/HNT7UPq
---
It was started in Dec of 2018 and has over 6k members.
---
Go Impale Prot for dungeons and early 60 until you're at least Pre-BiS. Fury Tanking requires a certain threshhold of AP / Crit before it's better TPS than impale prot, and your quality of life is way higher in impale prot especially in 5/10 mans. Really it depends on your items more than anything, but don't assume you're doing it wrong just because you're impale prot for a while. At the same time, don't be afraid to go fury prot when its time to because the increase will be noticable at that point. The threshhold isn't just about your gear either. It's about how much breathing room your healers seem to have. Flying through content with absolutely no issues? No reason to not just do more damage and TPS by being fury prot as long as healers can keep you alive. 
---
But it will always feel bad playing a warrior without tactical mastery outside of a raid setting, so I generally stay impale / prot for most other content and put on pure dps gear and a shield so my rage generation isn't horrible. With this respec cap being 50g and warrior being the worst class to farm gold on, i'm not sure it would be a good idea to flip flop specs a lot.
---
So Shaman is off the table for me then.
---
".modify scale" is a mangos GM command that can scale any player model or NPC. All models have a default scale assigned by the server, since emulator developers never had access to anything server side it's pretty easy for them to get these things wrong.
---
Lmao
---
He is not wrong though.
---
Skip that shit. Grind to make up for the exp loss. If care about your leveling efficiency that is.
---
Name checks out.... I support Sanders but people like you are ridiculous
---
Not really, because it's still in the world, so it can't be the same thing.  Also, people would have to still run around the zones.
---
Slap tariffs on it
---
max keebles big move
---
It’s funny to me all the people who argued with me on the forums about how there will be no world firsts in classic. Not that these count since its beta but if these are here it’ll happen in classic.
---
I rerolled a rogue just to be a pvp guild and this was my experience too but I only stuck with it to R10.
---
I’m honestly no expert, I’ve just been researching the hell out of this for a few months now. I’m not going to be able to provide any actual “vanilla” experience (I maimed rogue through TBC)  but at least from what I can tell, if you have anyone remotely reliable to play with, and hey are going any sort of class with healing capabilities, warrior will be the best spec period, in both pve and PvP.
---
If you’re like me where you’re going to be more limited in your playtime, but still want to dabble in a bit of everything, Druid will probably be better.  
---
I’m banking on playing with friends, but not in any sort of organized manner. I’ll jump on some days/nights for a few hours and other nights not at all. Just due to the handcuff warriors really need to thrive in PvP I decided it wouldn’t be a good choice for me, especially when you add in the miserable leveling and borderline worst gearing requirements warriors just didn’t seem worth it for me specifically. YMMV
---
As for a breakdown:
---
Warrior will be in your face always hitting someone with something. You’re a literally wrecking ball that’s trying to catch as much shit as possible in your trajectory. It’s reliant on teammates for purges/bind clear/heals, but with all of those things you’re an undeniable god.
---
Druid is much more elusive and nuanced. You’re going to be popping in and out of every single form performing specific tasks with each. Cat to prowl, open up stun, shapeshift out, fairies fire, moonfire, insect swarm, shift bear charge, maul, shift out travel to break slow/cc, shift out normal heal/stomp/hot, shift back bear forever and ever. You’re not going to go head on with someone and your fights are going to be long and slow and methodical. 
---
Im sure there’s a lot more I’m not thinking about that other people could chime in on, but that’s a fairly simple baseline I feel of both.
---
FWIW, I’m in beta and still can’t figure out what I want to do. I’ve leveled like 6 classes so far to 15ish and I’m still trying to grasp their play styles while also taking into consideration how much they might change at 60. I’m still leaving Druid but I think my biggest turnoff right now is shapeshifting is a bit clunky as a manual process. I do miss the live version that auto shifts you out of animal form to cast spells and shifts you back in to use other abilities.
---
Also just gonna say sorry for typos, wall of text + mobile doesn’t work well.
---
I cant wait to play poe for 4 hours like I do every time a new league comes out.
---
I mean for average guilds too.
---
Nope. You will see.
---
Almost every hunter worth their salt now had the gun on the beta
---
[deleted]
---
Cant tell..if guy sucks.. or if autistic anti streamer circle jerk continues..
---
From an engineering perspective that’s stupid. The layering should not be coupled with what you are doing in the game, it’s a infrastructure issue. 
---
The solution is to have sticky sessions. A common practice within engineering where instead of load balancing round robin style the load balancer has a preference based on history.
---
As an alliance rogue I would stealth to the horde town at the top of a needle, cause a ruckus, then jump off the cliff with my engineering parachute cloak when I was about to die.
---
Same
---
Esfand would disagree
---
Why is it so hard to decide do i want to use daggers or something else. That sweet ambush or backstab crit becons me, but im sure swords or other weapons could do nicely in other ways than just starting crit.
---
It existed in Vanilla. But was far less viable as Ret Paladins already had mana problems and seal twisting exacerbates that.
---
Yeah, this may seem like a silly little moment but it's honestly very encouraging to see their quick responses to all the testing!
---
You dont even know what hit cap is.  How can you even say that?
---
You had a macro to throw down all your totems at once?
---
The original release was 4 discs. Later releases were 5.
---
What was he gonna do anyway ? WSG all day for the next few weeks ? 
---
Even if he makes another character, he kept complaining about everything (slow gameplay, horrible balance, lack of QOL features ...) leveling his first one, he wont stick to beta, like 95% of BFA players won't stick to classic on release.
---
He's gonna go back to God of War and POE legion.
---
They drop one at a time, the effect extends 20-30 yards depending on your spec, they last 1-2 minutes, and only affect your party.
---
Yea but you can't get that until phase 2 at earliest and its gonna be tough without BG. So likely phase 3. Id still get LH Helm. Also its good to still have LH even if you have r10. If you get LH, Accuria, then 2 more hit and you are capped. Domo bracers and ring and you are done. Opens you up to lots of gear options.
---
It's people like you I hope will not play wow classic
---
Also, I did this in TBC because I needed to... but I'm pretty sure you could put soulstones in your bank.
---
So when you're bored or farming stuff stack a few bank bags full of soulstones for when you're running late for raid and "raid" your bank for a few SS's to top off.
---
I used to wait for blizzard to give us a free respec
---
There are lots of people at the Olympics, but not all of them win gold.
---
Daily reminder that classic is retail too.
---
Did you read the e-mail?
---
Did you read the email my dude?
---
I'm only talking about talents here. Paladins got their greater blessings in 1.9 and has nothing to do with the talents. Mages will do lower dps yeah, one of the big reasons why I think they should use the 1.0 talents. Mages got their revamp in the Naxx patch, so for pretty much all of Classic they will use talents the content wasn't designed with. 
---
Warriors actually complained when their shield discipline was replaced by shield slam. It does quite a lot of threat but warriors usually go fury for tanking anyways. Paladins, priests, warriors and warlocks all have their important talents anyways, it's just the utility that changes a bit.
---
Plaguelands are no longer Plagued.
---
I mean if you are going to keep it a secret its not making much of a point is it.
---
I wouldn't be looking for a guild until either it releases or you are actually in the game. Feels a bit ahead to try to join something 90 days out since most people may or may not commit to it at this point.
---
Can we get this stickied please?
---
So we were both a little wrong as it turns out. The picture above is certainly the one from WotLK. The BE one from vanilla was wearing nearly identical armor to the NE version.
---
WEESA GOIN HOMMMEEEEE!
---
In Vanilla WoW, ret is a solid DPS option IIRC. 
---
Feral too, but I think moonkin out does it.
---
You often call people liars without any sort of proof? You believe Hilary is a reptile I suppose?
---
I think so...!
---
Let me guess, you are one of the low iq spergs who actually takes the shit quin says seriously.
---
The cycle of trying to stay hyped and or busy while we wait for August which seems like forever starts with this topic, out of desperation hahah
---
who the hell is quin and why does this matter?
---
All of his complaints are correct. You're also correct that he's likely to go back to God of War, and he said he would definitely play Legion league.
---
It's not going to happen dude, for reals. Only patch progression will ever change that and even then it will only be historical changes. I, for one, have zero problem with it, even when I know I'll be playing a generally considered "gimp" spec/class.
---
Lol whoops
---
They fixed it during vanilla yes, not sure about which patch. I discovered it by accident on Nost (didn't play vanilla) by using the jumper cables on my succubus. Thought I was the leet warlock god for finding it out, only to realise that obviously people found out about it 15 years ago. It was quickly fixed on Nost too.
---
I think they should take the classic model and apply it to the next expac of the retail game.  Wipe out azeroth and make a new planet with 40 zones and everyone starts at level 1, something like that.
---
Stress test only I’m afraid. You can see the realms but they are offline to you. Until you get a beta email, you will only have the stress test access.
---
Ashenvale Forest is no longer a forest.
---
The Barrens is no longer barren.
---
Desolace is no longer desolate.
---
All of the Cataclysm changes made the old zones smaller and less deadly.  A LOT of them used to be huge, sprawling, dangerous places.  The world, and many dungeons, were carved into bite-size pieces.
---
Never had a Druid in UBRS?
---
So there's just that one mount (something about farming sands) that is unique to the server, and everything else is just a large grind / very rare chance of dropping?  
---
What if you got that one-per-sever mount on a server and transferred to another one?
---
Server infrastructure has 5x the performance it had when classic came out. There is literally NO reason for layering to exist other than 'we spent a few million in engineering R&amp;D and need to make use of it'.
---
My mind was blown, this would be the perfect way to continue. I like this butterfly effect thing.

Work at a brewery, could probably fit 5 hours of wow time in a 10 hour brew day.
---
Hi, /u/PP3V42G3H
---
"1 anecdotal observations refute this, because pleanty of MS wars have been observerd clearing endgame content."
---
Just because you can go to end game content doesn't mean you are not bad in a raid. You can do end game content terribly. You can drag someone with no talent points spent at all through any raid in Vanilla. Doesn't mean you should. If you knew how logic worked, you wouldnt make arguments like this. 
---
2 your argument leads to an absurd conclusion. If MS is not viable because their dps is “sub par” and they lower raid dps, then it would make sense to bring tanks, healers, and fury dps warriors exclusively since fury warriors are by far the top dpsers after bwl.
---
And that is basically what super try hard guilds do. They maximize on furys and mages and minimize on other classes (taking the minimal needed hunters and such). You still do want mages bc they do crazy damage as well, aoe is good, etc. I think that is a bit unreasonable for the average guild. But expecting your dps warriors to use the better dps spec that doesn't fuck over your raid is not a very unreasonable expectation at all.
---
I never said you need to min/max the shit out of everything. You keep putting that on me and I have never said that. Saying that you shouldn't play a weaker spec that screws over others is not equivalent at all to saying that we need to only bring furies at all. Other classes don't ruin raid wide dps. Other classes don't have better specs for dps than the one in question. Its the same with smite priest, don't play it. Play a shadow priest because it is the better dps spec. 
---
Again, very weak arguments where you simply try to misrepresent my arguments to make it easier to argue. You have done this the entire time. Why would you ever be arms in a raid over fury?
---
no clue either lol
---
I remember every major minja/shitty person from my server experience lol, the one guy tried to get a name change to avoid the hate - got more because people had him on friends specifically to watch for name changes
---
Let me guess, you are one of the low iq spergs who sucks quinn's dick and donates to his stream
---
The mechanics are simple, but the difficulty lies elsewhere.
---
Thank the Lord for greater blessings lol
---
Overwhelmingly in vanilla, the crafting professions are gold sinks.  If you want to earn money, pick up herbalism/mining/skinning... on my rogue alt I indulged in Alchemy/Herbalism because potions are great and herbs sell.  On my main mage, I gave up tailoring early on and picked up herbalism and mining, made a small fortune.
---
Me personally I want them to do like a multiverse of some sort. Do TBC and WOTLK but from there go in a different direction. Deathwing never happens. Keep flying in certain zones or never implement them. Keep it as original as possible. Maybe just add 5 level like they did but instead of adding very powerful gear kinda do a stat squish at the end game. Just don’t do what they did previously. As many can tell ruined WoW
---
Metas develop in video games over time. There is no rule saying we have to take any spec to the raid no matter what. Players determine who goes to raids and who don't. Its always been this way. "Literally the worst" is playing a sub par spec that fucks over others for no reason at all.
---
Lightning's Blade US, alli
---
TSM does this too. It’s not really a big deal to the economy
---
Hunters level much faster and grind easier, but rogues are tons of fun too.  You can make money with both classes but that'd be from double gathering professions or sure, clearing instances of a lower level and AHing low-level mats that rich players can't be bothered to grab on their own.
---
I think the debuffs is going to be a huge wake up call. I cant wait for raid leaders to yell at the warlock with corruption on the boss, or the hunter with serpent sting. People will want to dps the boss all they want until theyre yelled at to remove every spell from their bar except shadowbolt
---
I honestly do not remember, I played a hunter and could double trap dragons so I kept getting invited back to run UBRS. We most likely did have a druid that could hibernate but I remember a room in UBRS that had 4 dragons in it and if you could cc 3 of them it easy easy to clear.
---
Love it

Oh my ... To think I'd been considering reading some Tolkien again to get the lingo and trying a RP server... Reading this makes me realize why there's the dichotomy of RP vs. "Normal" lol

where are you getting the combat log from? Is it a file in your wow folder or something or an addon?

Definitely some nostalgia for me. First couple toons were orc, and troll. This is the first area that kicked my ass. There were some good level, tightly packed mobs on those islands.

yeah. it's been a while since i quested in the updated barrens (I know old barrens much, much better from leveling lots of toons back in the day and more recently on private servers) but from what i recall the divisions / trenches just ended up being annoying when you were trying to get from a to b
---
That's right, I have noticed it too.
---
It's really not that bad, but you want to keep your bags fairly clean in order to carry many should. It's a game about killing things, just make sure use drain soul at the end of killing things.

---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Why would a 2005 screenshot be an absolute proof. It's stupidly easy to photoshop it for whatever reasons.
---
Weaponsmith isn't that great since we're post-Normalization. The stuff you could make used to be really good, but not it's kind of meh. Also a lot of dungeon loot was buffed so there's more competition you can just farm.
---
Armorsmithing though gets some good stuff eventually. And you need to be an armorsmith to craft Dark Iron Plate (which is BoP).
---
Weaponsmithing didn't become really good again till TBC.
---
No. What's your point ?
---
Thousand Needles was a horde sanctuary from the Hellscape that was Hillsbrad and Arathi Highlands. That and feralas. The distance from Alliance capitols made it possible to level on an unbalanced PvP server.
---
wReStLiNg'S nOt FaKe!
---
I actually really like post cata redridge. When I first did it after cata I was so excited because I figured all the zones would be great like that.
---
They weren't
---
Yep
---
Do you realise how childish you sound?
---
I've also narrowed it down to these two. 
---
Deadzone is a nightmare to deal with at times is one factor for sure
---
the thing i like the most about this video is his analogy of just being able to put in any other classic game and play it again today.
---
wow is such a historic game its a shame people cant just try it as it was back then
---
Not possible, no more than you could cast healing wave and lightning bolt at the same time.
---
Because there were actually people who talked like this who played it... and were serious.
---
Lol like you wouldn't
---
What does that mean? Just because we are starting in 1.12 doesn't mean everything would be exactly the same as then. Assume a weapon, spell, etc was OP and broken then or you could still kite Kazzak all the way to storm wind. Don't think they would re-enable those things just because they were that way in 1.12.
---
couldn't watch the ramble
---
He also is a literal white supremacist. Lol.
---
Did you forget hunters?  Flare, traps, wingclip spam, spider pets, track stealth.  They're much better at making a druids life miserable than a Rogue is.
---
I thought they addressed this during one of their interviews*. Someone asked if they would have the same character models, and their (Ion, I think) response indicated that gnomes, for one, would not have some of the same issues during vanilla, specifically so they wouldn’t have problems swimming during an encounter, if that was not a designed mechanism of that specific encounter.
---
*source needed (...I should probably try to find that interview but I really don’t have time)
---
This is how I plan on finding my future guild. The road to 60 is long and you usually end up finding some people you click with along the way.
---
I've been there and I've done that. I know what I want from WoW and that ain't it...
---
You don't actually have any examples of "a weapon, spell, etc" being OP.  You're just making stuff up to try to win some argument that doesn't even exist.
---
How items behaved in 1.12, the stats they had, the interactions they did, is what they are trying to recreate for us with Classic.
---
Do you know if your friend had multiple people on his list? Interesting that you got added TUE and are already in while I'm not, and one guy who was added on the 16h but not in.
---
Don't measure against other player models, because they were changed aswell, measure against unchanged wall marks etc
---
My friend specifically mentioned I was the only one that was put on his list so that I was the only priority, which is cool of him to do. No access yet
---
Do you recall if it was around 6 PM PST and when you got put on the list?
---
Hmm, if any went out at 6 PM PST unfortunately it is not mine. No update on the launcher, no realms available. Darn.
---
Didn't get in
---
&gt; and all content balanced around 8 slots 
---
That really isn't true. Blizzard didn't know people would stack CoE/CoS, stack armor debuffs, etc. to maximize damage done to raid bosses. They increased debuffs from 8 to 16 because people complained they couldn't use skills like Serpent Sting and Corruption (or rather, they would fall off easily) not because raids wanted more competitive debuffs like Shadow Weaving or Ignite.
---
The armor of bosses didn't drastically jump (if at all) once the debuff cap was raised from 8 to 16, showing Blizzard didn't balance them around the cap at all.
---
You're not wrong at all.
---
maybe I'm missing something, but that clip has nothing to do with nameplates?  
---
Also, do you have proof from vanilla that it was 10 yards? like where is this coming from?
---
Hi, /u/MajorVermin
---
Imagine being this invested in somebody else playing a video game. Yikes.
---
More like after all the bull shit Blizzard has pulled, people should be taking them to task and making sure they're being honest.
---
That dude is undeniably right. WoW has gone way downhill. I think more people are excited about Classic than even play retail.
---
On a side note, I'm a bit surprised at how many of these you made, going out of your way to tell everyone I was wrong, before even considering I might be right.
---
Ret paladin gameplay is horrid. How anyone enjoys playing it I will never know.
---
Dang, that's a good bit. Do you know if your friend invited other people besides you? Apparently there is a priority system.
---
My friend said I was the only one he put on his list for priority, but still no access.
---
Play undead lock to be superior than alliance locks and win the mirror match also free mount at 40
---
He's actually 100% correct. You're all blindly trusting blizzard because "They said it was right".
---
I'm looking forward to someone testing this for real.
---
I don't think that's how F&amp;F has ever worked, I think F&amp;F has always been a guaranteed invite because it's a perk for being a Blizzard employee
---
Mark Kern said it only applied to starting zones. Their statements aren't even matching up.
---
for sure. And i can actually read all the text and see everything clearly in these new videos lol
---
&gt;  or much more common, the Brewfest kodo 
---
Added in patch 2.4.3
---
Hunters have a little less gear competition too. Your main damage dealer is ranged weapon that you and other hunters get first dibs on.
---
You won't have access to anything you have on retail.
---
Check Preach's videos, his current beta stuff is pretty solid vanilla tanking advice.
---
Just take his constant bashing of shield slam with a grain of salt. 
---
While SS was absolutely shit for a good chunk of vanilla, they buffed it through the roof in Naxx, and he did say he'd give deep prot a shot once they raise the level cap (or the game goes live...whichever happens first).
---
Well I mean they had "mechanics" back in the days, only different ones. I would say they fine tuned with every release. So the perfect WoW would be the grind of Vanilla with the mechanics of retail?
---
Ah, oops, it all runs together thinking back :P
---
Honestly I don’t even know if a wave happened last Friday. I remember thinking it was quiet on here about invites. So maybe it doesn’t occur Friday to Sunday
---
Dude come on you were not setting timers and logging spawn times 15 years ago so you are not going to remember if you saw it or not
---
&gt;Vanilla Naxx dmg values was the same as for wotlk Naxx for most fights.
---
Source for this? How can that be considering in wotlk character HP was like 10x what it was in vanilla. Seems like if the damage was the same then it would either be trivial in wotlk or impossibly high in vanilla
---
I'd be alright forgetting about the literal white supremacist
---
I'm saying having a bunch of farmers hanging out at Tyr's Hand didn't make all the stuff spawn faster.
---
its sort of an as it was game
---
balance could never be made perfect and if they started nerfing or buffing classes people would loose their minds.
---
in a way unbalanced.but true to the original is the best ballance
---
I feel like that was only a really bad thing when the badge gear started getting REALLY good, the later stuff like some of the ZA badge gear and especially the isle of queldanas gear. The initial badge stuff was fairly harmless. I guess "slippery slope" though lol
---
Nope. These dumb fucks will blindly trust whatever they say.
---
Keep being loud.
---
BfA had a multi million dollar advertisement campaign.
---
Classic is in beta.
---
Just saying.
---
I had to look it up because it didn't seem right. :D
---
I am.
---
Blizzard lies constantly, and ruined one of the best games I've ever played.
---
I'm not sure if anyone else has chimed in, but I can 100% confirm that the basilisks in the shimmering flats did not stun you if you turned away.  I killed a lot of these things in vanilla and I distinctly remember this.
---
Damn that site is not up to date with GDPR.
---
And they think they are.
---
Typical.....
---
&gt;  I hope they find a solution, but I don't see one that doesn't kill the immersion or leave exploits available.
---
I do: no sharding/layering/whatever they decide to call it this week to sell us on the same crappy idea.
---
Let the launch be the big, beautiful, chaotic mess it's going to be. Things will calm down and sort themselves out in a week or two just like they did after the big, beautiful, chaotic mess of the original launch back in '04.
---
MMOs are all about the social element. Queues suck, but they suck equally for everyone, making it a shared experience players can bond over.
---
Stop creating an additional problem where one needn't exist in the first place.
---
Pretty much everything gets a clean slate, re-farm... no collections/account-wide heirlooms, no creature comforts.  If this is a car, you're getting cloth seats, roll-up windows, manual locks, a stick-shift and no carbon fiber.
---
Here’s the thing, I want nothing but classic to be amazing and do better then retail but if the over pay for more servers and the hype isn’t there (after launch) that’s a waste of money.
---
Id rather have them add as they go along.
---
Bizzard's slapped a 35% tariff on all gold coming from China to control the problem.
---
These work in the beta.. see here  [https://www.twitch.tv/aylegaming/clip/CloudyPricklyYakPeanutButterJellyTime](https://www.twitch.tv/aylegaming/clip/CloudyPricklyYakPeanutButterJellyTime)
---
Well then you are left with underpopulated realms when the tourists are done.  I approached my initial assertion that we were all on the same page with not wanting underpopulated realms or realm mergers.  Underpopulated realms are bad for obvious reasons and realm mergers are far worse than a temporary period of time with sharding/layering.
---
Rogues can solo BRD coffer chests for those head/leg enchants.
---
RemindMe! 100 days
---
That or a Hunter are a pretty effective FC stopper. It gets boring though.
---
&gt; Welcome to 2019 where people ~~scream at their screen over 2 pixels~~ are sick and tired of Blizzard ruining something they love.
---
Mark my words: if Classic WoW fails, private servers are going to explode, and they'll overtake retail. It was already happening before, and is the only reason they're releasing classic now. Because other people were capitalizing on it. (NOSTALRIUS)
---
High octane auto attacks!
---
You don't need to stance dance for tanking, just use def. Just spam your shouts, sunder armour, shield bash on casters and a heroic strike every now and again. That's the basis of it.
---
I do actually agree that retail is more scripted and directed, but I don't see this clear as an example of that. You can still struggle through an instance 10 levels above you on live if you so chose. The only reason this particular thing happened was they were on beta with a level cap of 30. If that weren't the case they would have just levelled up and cleared it normally.
---
Redridge was probably an improvement.  It was poorly tuned in Vanilla.
---
Gotta ruin the world before you ruin the gameplay. dat logic
---
its a seperate game to retail
---
tbh i quietly wish they had backups of everyones characters and i could just continue playing my lock but nah its essentially a brand new game
---
It's a beautiful zone.
---
This would actually be a good move for healthy pvp. The 50g forces most people into either pvping with a pve spec, which sucks, or they can burn time farming the gold to pvp instead of pvping, just to pvp, or not pvp. If you want healthy BGs and pvp, you should support lower costs.
---
As someone who had to choose between pvping as a prot warrior, or not pvping in vanilla, this sucked and it would be nice if it was changed.
---
Sounds good.
---
it's a classic i-walked-to-school-uphill-both-ways-in-the-snow thing
---
That's only more of a reason for them to post proof.
---
Stop with the blind trust of Activision, please. It's gonna bite you, and everyone else here, in the ass when they release a sloppy version of Classic. Hold them to a high standard. They get paid more than enough.
---
you can always buy your own mount training.
---
it's only other races training you need exalted for.
---
It's still REAL TO ME DAMMIT!
---
yeah the gatekeepers just can't believe that their game isn't quite as hardcore as they wanted to remember
---
It's weird that me and the other guy were both told Thursday from our respective friends. So clearly our connections are told when their friends should expect to get in. (And I should pass the priority system since I was his only person he used F&amp;F on.)
---
My lurking and guessing seems to be that they are slowly trickling F&amp;F in, and that is why you dont see new posts here really just for F&amp;F (Because most the F&amp;F people probably aren't posting on this sub)
---
&gt; The models for tauren and gnomes are actually smaller than what they appear in-game
---
I see you posting this over and over again.. what does that even mean?
---
These are screenshots from in-game. The scale / model size is still not matching up with Vanilla screenshots.
---
yeah those caster trolls could fuck you up
---
You could have a macro that would drop them in a sequence, but you would have to repeatedly click it.
---
Each totem triggers the global, so can only drop one at a time.
---
Flying mounts. Wtf.     
---
    
---
Dead Azeroth.  Neat.    
---
   
---
Skip MC-Naxx?   Cool bro.
---
There's no specific time to reach a quest or an area... until the Ahn'Qiraj gate opening event.  If you want the special mount you sure as shit better bust your ass.
---
&gt;field service
---
That means he's dealing with clients. So, not the *best* job but pretty damn good
---
DA DUN DUN DAAA nice!
---
My main concern with content after Naxx is that the people developing the content might not actually understand what made the classic content good, then we would just have BFA bosses in a completely wrong expansion.
---
It goes with you and that server loses it.  In practice, the AQ40 mount is on a lot of retired toons at this point, and it's ground only, so you don't see it often at all - it's an ugly black beetle.
---
I did and I thought it was dumb so I disagree. There's nothing wrong with difficulty levels. People clear the lowest if they so please and if they are up for the challenge they can clear it on higher difficulties. It actually ultimately brings more people into raiding as they would otherwise just hit a brick wall and go nowhere. 
---
An example here: when I was 7 Halo CE came out. My brother and I played it through on Easy and even still we struggled because we were young and inexperienced. Later we would work up to clearing it on the higher difficulties, eventually legendary. If the game had only Heroic or Legendary, or just Legendary by itself, we would have never gotten into it and may have skipped the whole *franchise* as a result. Difficulty levels are a good thing despite how much gatekeeping elitists have been campaigning against them lately.
---
I apparently have the option to mail my stress test character from beta, after stress test is over. 
---
puzzled face
---
And?
---
I enjoy playing the auctionhouse on multiple realms, both on EU and NA realms. This means that I generate a decent amount of gold that I do not have any use for, so I buy WoW tokens to pay for all my subscriptions and my hearthstone packs. I haven't paid a cent for WoW, Hearthstone or Overwatch in years.
---
That being said, I actually reactivated 5 of my accounts specifically to increase my chances of getting invited to the beta - so far this has not paid off, as I still do not have access to the beta.
---
At this point I'd gladly pay a few hundred euros worth of battlenet balance to get access to the beta, but unfortunately that's not an option. 
---
Guess I'll have to wait until August 27th.
---
SJWs are cancer.
---
Yup.
---
I dont get it
---
you do. But only if you AREN'T a NE.
---
NE can always buy Nightsaber training.
---
Everyone else needs exalted with BOTH darn and WSFT to use the Frostsaber, since the frostsaber needs nightsaber training to use.
---
(only dropped mounts ignore training requirements, not purchased ones).
---
Cool story. Most people do not stand for doing the same content and the same grind for 3 years straight so I don't care.
---
This should be a mechanic in the 1.13 raid!
---
&gt; people developing the content might not actually understand what made the classic content good   
---
You are 100% Correct.   
---
Still, Ive been down TBC, no thanks.   
---
Lets write a WOW Constitution and make GOOD MMOs
---
While that may be a factor, I think a large portion of it stems from a distrust in Blizzard. 
---
Clearly people interested in Classic WoW love the design philosophies behind the game.
---
 Current WoW has become so distanced from classic that it no longer resembles the same game. 
---
I don't think a lot of people have faith in today's dev team's ability to create new content in the spirit of the original game. 
---
Better end at Naxx than have the next raid riddled with catch-up gear and whatnot.
---
Pretty bland zone, not much to do as an Alliance player, but it had so much personality. It was like a highway for Alliance to get to Shimmering Flats, and was pretty cool because behind every spire could be horde! It was a tense zone to be in as Alliance, because it was Horde-dominated and confusin to get around, so it made you feel on edge.
---
Also the elevators that I may or may not mind control people off of from shadowmeld 😈
---
I think I'd rather stay a wandering adventurer in Azeroth free to make my own story instead of becoming glorious God-general again. Let somebody else handle the voidlords. I've got my hands full with these damn quillboar.
---
Classic is going to be way bigger than we all anticipated it being, isn't it?
---
&gt;  I think a large portion of it stems from a distrust in Blizzard.
---
Ouch, True.
---
No. Just stop. Cussing someone out doesn't make you right.
---
The screenshots show a very clear difference.
---
It takes a special level of delusion to think that people left specifically because of flying and summon stones/queues.
---
As for the streamer thing: I'll add that to the list of things that definitely, actually happened.
---
It's just hype. Real online will decrease when people start getting 30-35 lvl. After that, leveling would be harder.
---
nah even the start.  i remember just doing the same short dungeons over and over and over for nothing besides those tokens, it burnt me out more than running a dungeon for specific pieces in vanilla.
---
I worked on Nostralia. As a coder. Multiboxing was a thing that made vanilla reference possible? You're actually on crack.
---
Short-term virility is not where you make huge investments. Let people play the game for more than two months without half or more of the population fading and i'll say to invest in some more servers. Its not even that im faulting vanilla as a game. I'm just not sure inexperienced people are going to be happy with the grind once they realize how far behind they fall.
---
The majority of the people against it are too dumb to realize that they can keep Classic servers *and* develop Classic+ content on a different set of servers.  Then there are the people who are against it because they want TBC, and they also are too dumb to realize that not every Classic server needs to be advanced to TBC.  Like there is some limit on the number of servers that can exist at one time in the universe.
---
The only thing people aren't going to forget about this guy is that he's a racist asshole.
---
Drain the swamp!
---
What I would like to see is new content that better works side by side with existing content without adding power creep and staying within the 60 level cap. Like alternate leveling zones for extra variety leveling alts and dungeons and raid that are on the same tier and other raid and dungeons where the only difference is look and maybe set bonuses. In theory I would like to think this would stop making other dungeons and raids irrelevant and people can have more options to customize their look without a transmog system and without adding power creep. Wether it would actually turn out that way I have no idea, but is an interesting thought experiment of adding content that people will want to do without increasing level caps or power level.
---
If this is legit real screenshot then gnomes always were definitely bigger
---
I can't believe the goosebumps I'm getting from this. That's some of the happiest times of my teenage years right there. God I miss that world and that time. Classic can't come soon enough.
---
&gt; The majority of the people against it are too dumb to realize that they can keep Classic servers and develop Classic+ content on a different set of servers.
---
Ha, highfive. True.
---
People often forget stealth slows you down by a lot in vanilla compared to retail where it’s a speed buff
---
Thank you, holy fuck. Why are 50+ people in here defending what is clearly WRONG?
---
Wouldn't all the machinima style videos on YouTube from 2006 make it easy to check sizes?
---
Thank you for posting this.
---
You sure have a lot of alt accounts! Thanks for posting all these comments.
---
&gt;RemindMe! 96 days "doo diss"
---
 RemindMe! 97 days "do it pussy"
---
Yeah, I played a Hunter in BC so I remember the bag issue. I guess I’m mostly concerned about having to spend 15-20 minutes pre-BG or dungeon to farm shards.
---
Problem with that is, I think a lot of the stuff that people love is also pretty subjective, so that list could go on for pages and pages, but there would be very little that would be able to be put into a concrete point or "design plan". 
---
I think it mostly comes down to people wanting the game to be an RPG again in design, not just genre name, which is a pretty hard thing to teach people to understand, especially if they have not played games back before everything started to have "RPG" aspects, instead of actually being RPGs in their entire design.
---
No.. They can target specific addons. They've done it before.
---
it's a direct quote from the gamepedia article about ingame character height..?
---
Yeah stop objectifying fictitious, pixelated women /s.
---
Fuck man the painting fits the setting and world, not only that but it’s a game of all things. Fight some real world issues.
---
That’s what I’m saying! Like I’m going to level my rogue as ambush spec and just respec at 60 to fit the mold. I know some people say “oh you gotta be combat swords and get riposte and gurr it has to be this way” but fuck that I want to literally one shot something every now and then with an ambush crit and get that hot flush wave of excitement when I see the big ass number appear and the health bar just *vanish* lol
---
Not an alt account buddy but keep clinging
---
Race traaaacccccckkkkkk!

Tbh im going to play classic how i want to if i can im going to try and reform my old vanilla guild i was in that allowed diversity were our pvp premades allowed shadow priest dps shamans or even feral druids just so the whole team was happy and did their best and when some1 tells me otherwise ill laugh and /ignore as i dont have time for elitests opinions

Vanilla was great, but speaking as someone in a raiding guild that cleared BWL 4th on the server fairly early on, we were rigid and inflexible to creative specs/outliers - and I was a holy paladin.  Sure I got my Herald of Woe, but I didn't do real DPS until I switched mains to a mage in the expansion packs, and of course, the guilty pleasure, a twink rogue alt.

---
You forgot to log back over. Ouch! That's embarrassing.
---
I really wish they would add the content to classic that they couldn't during vanilla. Some examples being Karazan (with crypts), Vault dungeon in SW and Emerald Dream zone/raid etc.
---
That way it's new content but nothing that would break the way classic plays
---
depends on the class / spec you played I guess. For many classes there was really only 1 or 2 pieces (from the original badge gear, which was actually quite limited) even somewhat worth getting at all. You'd need to get the other 15-16 pieces from heroics and kara, and some really good things dropped from normal dungeons as well.
---
Eyes peeled for stealth cats O\_O
---
You do get an email, but it's not immediate. I think I had access for 24 hours before they sent mine.
---
You're an actual idiot lmao
---
I'm actually excited to see if anyone comes up with a new build or strategy that no one thought of in either OG vanilla or pservers.
---
Imagine millions of new players who haven't played ANY form of WoW getting onboard for the hype. Classic was #1 on Twitch recently so I'm guessing it will be #1 at launch for weeks.
---
I bet there will be a few game changing ideas that really surprise everyone.
---
“That believe their is no other way,” literally no one has said that.
---
Some streamers mentioned they could implement a 60 version of Karazhan.  There are other areas that dungeons could be tossed in.  Just releasing TBC would probably be easier.  If they did release new 60 content, maybe they could use it as a way to buff underperforming classes via specific gear instead of talents.
---
No, they haven't.
---
They made changes to the API that affected AVR, the addon that let you draw on the world that all group members could see. This prevented any other addon from using these features, but they were obscure and not used by many addons.
---
They made the use of addons like Babelfish, that allowed cross-faction communication possible, a violation of the ToS. They literally could not stop the addon because it was too simple, so they relied on user reports to ban/suspend accounts. It still works today.
---
Nowadays you just have flexible servers that change capacity based on load. This is why layering is a thing, it allows servers to expand and contract on the fly
---
I will be remaking my old guild with a few of the founding members from Vanilla, and we may laugh at you if you openly admit to min/maxing. If that’s your thing, great, but I don’t give a flying fuck how you spec your character.
---
I’m going to play whatever spec best fits my goals in the game.
---
Your comment history is just you going into multiple threads sperging out over quin and other streamers. My favorite part is that you just said "imagine being this invested in someone else playing a video game"
---
Yet you are literally raging daily about not getting in the beta while these streamers are. Jesus christ lol.
---
#1 No WSG at launch
---
#2 If you want rep, you need the early quests when they still give exp
---
The screen capture that is thrown around a lot (not sure if you are talking about this one) was from a private server, not vanilla. In this thread, people shared actual screenshot from vanilla and they match the current beta build.
---
&gt; which is a pretty hard thing to teach people to understand
---
Damnit you all are so right.
---
The min/max crowd doesn't actually believe that. They are telling people that if they want to min/max, you're a lot more restricted on specs.
---
Some people may enjoy other people playing sub-optimally in their raid group... others don't want to have to put in the work gearing BiS, farming consumables, and getting world buffs to carry a handful of people doing less damage than the tank. That's not them being a dick or telling people they can't do that, it's other people being disrespectful so that they can do what they want.
---
No one is saying that you can't do those builds and join a casual guild that maybe makes it through MC and Ony... People can play how they want. But don't then get upset if you aren't invited to raids in a guild that's trying to progress through AQ. It does take *some* amount of effort to get 40 people to make progress in later content beyond just showing up. And telling people to go play SPriest and ret paladin is kinda disingenuous if you're saying it to people who *do* want to progress through that content.
---
&gt; RemindMe! 96 days
---
I don't understand why people would think classic wow was ever hardcore in the first place. It was literally baby's first MMO status in 2004. Literally the most accessible MMO of them all.

---
Yeah, some guilds are like that and that's their prerogative.
---
Ted Cruz is totally a human being and not a bunch of lizards in a loose skin suit.
---
Burning Crusade zones get a pass, it's a world that's already been shattered and is barely even holding together.  The transitions can be abrupt and still make sense given the nature of what's happened there.
---
I mean he was the guy that hand delivered the Classic petition to Blizzard. Depending on your perspective that could be proof or proof he’s not taking too much credit.
---
There. That was easy. Blizzard/Activision are lying. Stop blindly defending it. We all want Classic back.
---
As a holy paladin, I used to duel another paladin for hours on end in front of Iron Forge until one of us was tired basically.
---
no.
---
&gt;Considering it's still sharding, they could've left the name alone and discussed the limitations introduced, but they didn't.
---
Again you ignore the intended differences between the two. But you've made up your mind on this so I don't see any purpose in continuing.
---
&gt; If not, Blizzard is going to keep pushing to have sharding/layering on permanently, which is the ideal solution for them.
---
What? The only reason sharding/layering is even being implemented in beta is to solve launch overpopulation issues. Why the hell would they want it on permanently, what possible gain could it give them that would require they deceive the players in this way? Aren't you being paranoid?
---
You used to be able to do more actions with 1 click, so it was much more automated.
---
People like you are what's going to end up ruining the game. Stop.
---
That line right there always made me question it but I never really knew until now.
---

---
I'm a single dad myself, no way am I hard core. I'm gonna take my sweet time. The first too leveling will be great. My worry is about a year, two years in. That said it's a small worry. If classic takes off then we should have a steady influx of people, and keep in mind the retail players that will only play between tiers.
---
Disabling exp came in Wrath. So not in Classic
---
Thanks for the pic, btw. I don't remember that, but memories are shitty and unreliable across the board. I could well have remembered my ranting after this model was reverted and forgotten the context for that rant.
---
In any event, I'm fine with agreeing that we were both partially incorrect.
---
Yeah, many of us did, but many of us didn't really view burning Crusade as wiping all our progress. Our characters are our progress, and they are far more than mere gear.
---
For ele, would you suggest not going Eye of the Storm because you can't sit proc it on classic and you shouldn't be getting hit anyways (with warrior)
---
&gt;Your only choice being is shaman. And you wont even heal, youll be a damage dealer more than not.
---
You're right about shaman being a dps healer. They would be a lot better at PvP healing if their friendly dispel wasn't so weak. Nobody on alliance side uses disease so that leaves them with poison and the odd tremor totem against disorganized groups.
---
\&gt; Still used in retail to this day. Standard procedure I think, in the WoW client. 
---
Its not used in retail anymore (pretty sure the icon is removed from the game files), hidden spells like this are mostly engi cogs and some that say Blizzard.  [https://puu.sh/DwVTM/f83e4c70eb.jpg](https://puu.sh/DwVTM/f83e4c70eb.jpg) 
---
I was really glad and surprised to see it was back in the classic client. It means you can do stuff like this  [https://i.imgur.com/cl5yGSB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cl5yGSB.jpg)  :P
---
And its green awwwpffftawww
---
&gt; they are far more than mere gear.
---
Power increase is part of character progression.   
---
Pay $60 to make your years of work irrelevant like a good little
---
Not unique, there can be as many Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal as there are guilds that complete the scepter and ring the gong within 10 hours of the first person that rings the gong.
---
There's been posts in the past dead on 6pm PST people saying they get in, and then people posting they got in later on so I definitely think they "trickle" in
---
All items will have their 1.12 stat values/appearance.
---
Thus it stands to reason that all items will drop from the locations they do in 1.12. Otherwise people will be forced to chase the original drop locations before time runs out, which the devs have stated they do not want. So T2 should from the outset only be Rag/Ony/BWL. Especially since they are using the 1.12 database as the basis for accurately recreating the original world.
---
By the same token, their stance on progressive itemization means that we won't see Eye/Leaf drop before Phase 2--_but_, even though patch 1.5 is properly in Phase 3, Sinew _should_ drop from the elites beginning in Phase 2 (and also Eye of Shadow from demons), because once it _can_ drop, it will use its 1.12 drop table.
---
Just my two cents.
---
The servers are virtualized on the same pool of hardware resources anyway. The load is going to be the same either way. More servers just means less layering. It just a matter of finding the right number where we aren't dealing with dead servers after x amount if time. I do believe blizzard will underestimate the demand and we will get stuck with layering for an extended period of time.
---
I was there from beta in 04 to Wrath. There was never a shortage of WPvP in Vanilla. Hell, some servers were known just for WPvP.
---
And if the post DECADE of private servers are anything to go by, it's going to be fine. Even with CRBGs in Vanilla you can have long queues.
---
In Vanilla, DHKs did FAR more to hurt WPvP than BGs ever could. There was still plenty of it even with them in the game.
---
Maybe they just made the world and other races scale larger?
---
/s
---
I want a progressive server that goes from vanilla - wrath because I love that era of the game despite some of its flaws like flying, but also love others like dual spec
---
I wouldn’t be opposed to new vanilla content if it was done right but like many people have said already, do we really trust a new generation of developers to keep the content consistent throughout the experience. Also then at what point does blizzard stop making content for vanilla and then how do they progress onto the next thing? If they don’t then at what point is it even vanilla anymore? With all this new content, are we supposed to get raid unlock by raid unlock for free or do we pay? What about new players that want to get into the end game but can’t because not enough people need to run previous content now (Mc - AQ)? How would you balance catch up mechanics without making the old raids useless?
---
I would love for blizzard to reintroduce fringes of new content like hyjal and that unreleased BG (can’t remember the name) but ultimately if they want to progress the server without people stagnating at a limit it will have to go to TBC. On that depending on how classic is run I wouldn’t be opposed to petitioning for a TBC without flying
---
I mean he was streaming wow classic today
---
well it was the feeling of "buying" loot i guess.
---
before TBC, almost all epics you got were received after killing a boss - so you could celebrate with your friends upon getting the piece of loot.  and, you could look at a piece of loot in your inventory and remember "hey, I got that when we killed nef that one time with 5 people left alive."  I've got a problem with Naxx/AQ as well with how the class tier loot plays out, but it wasn't as bad as the token system.
---
Bad ones...
---
That's your choice, man. Do you and I'll do me
---
&gt; Why the hell would they want it on permanently
---
Why do they have it on permanently in retail? It's easier and more cost effect to manage the servers.
---
&gt;The only reason sharding/layering is even being implemented in beta is to solve launch overpopulation issues.
---
Then they'll almost certainly use it again during other overpopulated events unless we complain. If they think it's necessary now, why would they suddenly change their minds?
---
&gt; Aren't you being paranoid
---
Yes, but for good reason. Blizzard is known for constantly moving the goalposts and I think it's important to consider the implications of this.
---
That height chart pretty clearly has the top of the gnome's forehead around the armpit level of the dwarf, as opposed to the "1.12" screenshot where it's the same height as the dwarf's belt.
---
yeah I wish
---
Care to elaborate? Didn't know jontron was outwardly racist or anything tbh
---
nameplates are *not* supposed to be seen that far away. this is absolutely a game changer and we need to make noise about this issue.
---
Retail did not happen over night. It was 15 years of small "improvements" driven by a flawed design philosophy. I feel like asking for 1.13+ opens to door for improvements that dilute what we love about classic.
---
I'm sorry you feel like purchasing a new expansion made your work in the previous expansion irrelevant, but I sure don't feel that way about what I've done, haha.
---
Yeah, true. I do remember that.
---
People who were in the stress test, do you see the window with the stress server that says "offline" still? Or does it just say "no servers available" now?
---
If you’re progressing into Naxx, sure. However, you can get away with have a few off specs in your raid for most of the raid content. 5 ret paladins or 4 boomkins? No, but you’ll never have that many people playing those specs. Most people play the specs that get them a raid slot, so everything will naturally flesh itself out.
---
Min/maxing has gotten to the point where people are tracking each and every skill point for each of their members, which is ridiculous. If you say you are a ret paladin, I’m going to mark you down and a ret paladin. I don’t need to see your skill points. However, just know that a holy paladin will probably be invited to a raid before you, so you’re only hurting yourself.
---
I’m not going to ride my members for their specs. I just want to ensure we have X amount of tanks and X amount of healers. Once we get to those guy checks and if we wipe, then talks will be had and changes will be made. However, that’s for another time.
---
So many memories, I also miss TBC Barrens

You're missing what he's saying. PVPers **HAVE** to go into the world even when theyre not specifically looking for PVP, where they will most likely end up pvping anyway because everyone has to go out into the world to farm something or other.

Agreed, lets also not forget the other side. The majority of people after the first year will completely take over the low level BG's with their twinks. Most first time levelers will stop in to WSG or AB and get destroyed by these more hardcore players on their alts. Only giving them more motivation to continue leveling rather than doing BG's. I'm totally going by memory, but I don't remember the lower level battle grounds being overly popular at lower levels. Even in AV you would rarely see anything lower than level 60 because at that point, most peoples motivation was to just hit level 60 first.
---
&gt; I wouldn’t be opposed to new vanilla content if it was done right but like many people have said already, do we really trust a new generation of developers to keep the content consistent throughout the experience.

I know, But id rather try that than try TBC garbage. I played through CATA, and look back at so much wasted.

Vanilla was the best, Progression is the best. NOT EXPAC wipes.

I still think flying was one of the worst things to happen to wow. It destroyed that feeling of exploration. Hard pass.

Oh that's heaps good hes going to be streaming wow!
---
The oldschool sonic syndicate had a thank you note to their wow guild in one of their albums
---
&gt;to invest in some more servers
---
Blizzard’s cloud infrastructure is, as I understand it, built on AWS.
---
They have all of the resources they need - they just need to architect for elasticity during the surge of stress tests and the launch period.
---
not really. They said drop tables would be progressed and stuff moved around. I'm just curious how far they'll take it. 
---
Since they aren't actually removing anything, just moving it. Which is different from the unarmored mount situation was completely removed after a certain point and could no longer be acquired period.
---
So Phase 2 only Azuregos could drop it. Phase 3 any elite blue wyrmkin would have a small chance to drop it and you'd no longer be at the mercy of Guilds who were selling any extras they had.

Yo, don't misuse the pics I posted. I took that on a private server.
---
This was one of those first zones that I was taken aback by. It was so big and imposing, the mobs were a way higher level than me, and since I was Alliance it was basically hostile territory.
---
CLasSiC wOn'T Be poPuLaR - classic naysayers
---
This is what WoW Vanilla is all about.
---
Kind of hard when anything  against the nochange crowd is instantly down voted or harassed. They even want limitation on even new hardware because it 'wasn't classic' such as widescreen support.
---
Oh yes, so unpopular
---
Same, I actually kind of preferred it to hyjal. I don’t really get what the hate is all about, at the time I never noticed or felt that. In fact, what I do remember is how disappointed everyone was that the Naga Raif was cancelled since that plot ended on a cliff hanger and the art/environmental design was awesome.

I'm not mis-using anything, and you're one of like 4 people to post proof of it. They are using the models from BFA. Call them on it instead of blindly defending.
---
I would say Mark Kern is correct and Kevin is misremembering. Otherwise chinese farmers/bots would have made absurd amounts of gold in some areas by stacking.
---
Check the minimap - Thunderbrew Distillery, Dun Morogh

Probably in Loch Modan too though, think it's the same tavern setup
---
You are so much about me that you went through my comment history. Let that sink in.
---
hunter pulls, sum1 else attacks 1 mob, hunter feigns.
---
Only one mob remains on the agro table
---
The Lionheart Helm is Fury's best-in-slot for the entire game.
---
Weaponsmithing doesn't really offer anything.
---
The way movement speed increases stacked was changed in a recent expansion.  This could be a bug
---
Bryzes head in that Screenshot is barely above the knees of the night elf. Something isn't quite right with all this.
---
Yeah I think you're right about the Sinew/etc., reading the Itemization post again.
---
The MC T2 will be interesting though...as you say there was some broken itemization in MC and I don't think the affected classes will be happy about it if they can't even complete their T1.
---
Good stuff. He is right on the money. My problem with this “no changes” movement is it is based on slippery slope fallacies that any change immediately starts the path to dungeon finders and the thinking that because Blizzard destroyed the Vanilla experience that they are incapable of adding new content without ruining it. I don’t believe for a second that Blizzard devs and designers couldn’t maintain those pillars that he mentioned. There just doesn’t need to be specific directives from higher up and team leads to start deviating from those pillars.
---
They're just so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for dwarf men
---
It's been a while so can't remember everything, but I remeber arcanite reaper being a very strong axe for warriors until the changed attack speed. Paladins reckoning used be able to stack above 4 and could be stacked so high to one shot bosses. Some vanity trinkets used to have durations as long as their CD like Orb of deception, but then was later along with other vanity items had long CD placed on them. Kazzak used to be able to be dragged to cities and wipe them out until they introduced coding to have him reset after moving to far.
---
Zul'gurub was released in 1.7 and initially Hakkar's corrupted blood could be released unto cities wiping them out. So are you saying they will leave it active until it was originally patched from vanilla. That's why I think it's not a 1:1 recreation. Now like I said it's been a while so not sure how many we're active in 1.12, but they were just example of items that were OP or later nerfed in later patches. So wasn't sure if one of these things would be in its patch version or in-patched version
---
he was hamming it up. he was just done with beta
---
I've been in queue for an hour and a half, no 10-19s have fired yet on the pvp server.

Ion said they will start with a "Lean" realmlist and add more as needed
---
I just want to build a reputation for being above average as a tank. I think min/maxing is a side effect of that. With that said I intend to let people play how they want and will hopefully be geared enough to not need to rely on cc to survive bigger pulls.
---
Like any min/madder else, you fail to see the utilization of a cross-spec player during a raid. Yes, you lose the dps, but those players can step back at any time and throw minor heals if needed. Yeah, they’ll have lower dps than a warrior, but they can be utilized to help with dps and healing...
---
2 ret paladins are not going to kill your raid if you know how to utilize them correctly. However, I would never roll with 3 or more.
---
Agreed.  Couldn't have said it better.  Hopefully the community can come to the same conclusion about this.
---
My best resource for recruiting members so much so that I volunteered to be a mod there.  Great discord!!
---
"should get nearly 1 shoted" ; That's not how it works, higher level mobs only mean that they will hit you for sure, do crushing blows and crit way more often, all while doing the same damage as usual which is the intended vanilla damage range.  
---
The underleveled player will miss/dodge/parry/glance like crazy; things just take longer to kill and the risk of dying is higher. Unless I'm missing something that's pretty much it.
---
None of these gnomes have a buff though, what are you guys saying?
---
why would they change the model size, and why do the photos look so vastly different? They're using the character models from BFA.
---
it does in T3.
---
T2, AQ/ZG are for Ret.
---
there are some i like both about the same like the zone above orgrimmar but only because there was only 1 quest chain there linked to the wizard tower and cat made that zone questable.
---
I think every holy pally has a twink. I had a 19hunter to make up for my lack of dps lol. And eventually maxed a mage in BC before refilling warrior on horde.
---
HAH? YOU PLAYED WOW FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME?
---
I had to crawl through 4 miles of barbed wire to play on an IBM laptop to run wow on 3 FPS, you think you have it hard?
---
Candy ass.
---
Buying or selling gold should result in at least a 1 month ban. 2nd offense permaban.
---
Implying pressing two buttons is a significant investment of time rofl
---
man you tried way to hard to be edgy and hate just to hate. 
---
This circlejerking about retail = bad classic = good is just cringe.
---
Why would they have ever changed it server side instead of just getting the model right?
---
Why are gnomes the only model that's seeing this effect?
---
It's a simple requirement. If they don't add new content, the game will shed players.
---
The point is to maintain what made vanilla great, not to never change it.
---
Man. I remember just exploring as a ghost so I would never have to worry about dying!
---
Colors were pretty bland my I liked the creepy music.
---
Free mount ain’t so free with all the farming of resources necessary for it 🤢
---
I remember watching a video madseasonshow did on warlock/pally mounts
---
I haven’t used addons since vanilla and only used a couple of basic ones. 
---
Is Curse still the main software people use for putting in Addons to the game?
---
Will people be using Curse for Classic WoW?
---
I did want to try and do Classic with no addons as I don’t use them currently, but their functionalities are too important to ignore, so I have caved in and will get them - I just can’t remember how to put them in the game lol.
---
Has anyone counted the needles in Thousand Needles
---
I wish Blizzard had tried harder at making a better expansion.
---
Ya i was in SW yesterday during the stress test and didn’t see rag in my layer...
---
yeah they had some issues with the name plates, but they are working on it already.
---
I'm not talking about the gnome. The gnome clearly just has a server side scaling value. They are using the 1.12 value.
---
The peak of wow bfa when it wasn't out yet is also there and still lower than the current wow classic peak. So yes, it's comparable.
---
I’m confused because the video shows nothing in regards to this script?
---
And yet language evolves.
---
While i recognize flying is one of the first QoL changes and altered the game significantly
---
TBC and Northrend were awesome continents that idk how they would of done flying.
---
Being able to fly removed a lot consequences from the game.  And made the world smaller. As the world gets smaller you need more filler content (world quests/dailies etc)
---
Idk how i feel about TBC now. Since it was great with great story and environments it was the beginning or making wow easier and more automic.
---
with that i agree
---
It's worth winning the fight
---
I really hope to see the "streamers" for classic to go under 100 viewers post launch. And then droves of zombies that follow them be on some dying server once they quit.
---
This was how it worked originally but they changed it in patch 1.11. So in Classic it should not reset if you switch talents. Might just be a bug they haven't fixed yet. Don't let it scare you playing shaman.
---
Yeah it does often look like they neutered paladin a lot back them. Maybe since they were OP in pvp? Im not sure
---
hmm i dont remember really ever needing to group up for basic fetch quests and grinding quests
---
&gt;dumb fucks
---
Thanks for disproving all those people who call the classic community toxic and reactionary. You're doing important work here.
---
Thanks, but for now I'll trust Blizzard's 1.12 reference client over your misplaced anger and cynicism.
---
I 100% behind reusing the expansions but with a classic feel. No LFG / LFD / LFR. No flying mounts over 60% speed (maybe even less than that honestly). I want to do all the content over again just with, as he said, the pillars of Vanilla
---
No because people would never search for "WoW BFA", they would just search for "WoW"
---
It's a stupid comparison.
---
With all due respect; If they were using the 1.12 value, this thread wouldn't be here.
---
I think people misunderstand this sub and /wowservers as the vast majority of the Classic fan base. News flash: we are the minority here. None of my buddies are even remotely thinking of min/maxing, nor plan on doing it. They just want to roll as whatever spec they’ll have fun as and will help out the guild.
---
Yeah hopefully. And if nothing else, Blizzard can let them have their 1.12 only servers that that can just keep playing all they want. But I can guarantee that if Blizzard added new content that maintained the feel of Vanilla we all love, even the most hardline no changes members will find themselves reconsidering.
---
&gt;Thanks, but for now I'll trust Blizzard saying they fixed it, rather than the multiple screenshots in the thread from different people proving they're using BFA models in the beta.
---
The whole story structure shifted toward a single player experience around Cata.
---
Yea wasn't sure to what extent since it was mentioned that original CE pets would be available on Classic to use.
---
Also, rip to getting Deathcharger Rein's since I think at that point they were 0.02% instead of 1% drop.
---
What if that server already has one?
---
If anyone is curious, this happened while I was riding the boat. The zone loaded and I was stuck floating in the air. Figured I would have a little fun with camera perspective.
---
The unpopular part is that I believe it would make Classic and Retail indistinguishable from a homogenisation perspective even though they are vastly different games overall.
---
Obviously most people subscribe to the ‘play how you want’ mentality, but that’s not the point of the post.
---
"HE'S EATING MORGRAINE!!!" lmao
---
Wow I never thought about it like that but having zones that meld together coherently actually really does help bring the world to life. Think about taking a path through the Eastern kingdoms, starting from Arathi to Hillsbarad to Silverpine to Tirisfal all the way to Eastern and Western plaguelands. It actually makes geographical sense that these zones are connected, as they all have relatively similar terrains and ecologies, yet they all have their own unique tone, getting grimmer and spookier the deeper you go. That's why the world felt real.
---
And 6778 other things that made vanilla busted
---
So nah
---
Gathering car parts!
---
You only have a pic of her but no proof of it being in TBC, do you have proof of this pic being in TBC?
---
Gorgeous
---
It's not just the 1.12 client, they have a local instance of the server software from 1.12 running as well.
---
Well since the evidence is pservers then this whole thread *shouldn't* be here now that blizz confirmed it's accurate.
---
I paid a guy to try to recreate that pic and this is what we came up with. [Private server](https://i.imgur.com/TdDzacq.png) / [WoW 2006](https://i.imgur.com/OH3fxFq.png)
---
Definitely seems like scaling on the server is the problem.
---
&gt; compared to retail where it’s a speed buff
---
wait, what now?
---
Cmon if we dont have all day tues maintenence, and crashes leading to emergency maintenece on launches is it really the true vanilla experience.
---
Imagine being this upset and antagonistic over the height of fucking gnomes. 
---
If the minor, pointless, purported "lies" Blizzard is putting out stop man-children like yourself from playing Classic, I welcome it.
---
Its not wisdom, its marketing. You wasted your time.
---
Nope.
---
[Test Tickle]
---
You’re talking about like maybe the top 5-10% raiding guilds. I think you don’t realize how many casual guilds there will be in WoW...and people who don’t even care about PvE or PvP.
---
No thanks.
---
most zones were based on warcraft 1-3. wow just fleshed them out more but they already had an rough idea what most zones would be like.
---
It gets boring if the two teams are being useless and just dicking around in the middle. I honestly loved protecting flag carrier up top or protecting our flag as a night elf hunter in shadow meld with a stealth cat waiting at the bottom.
---
The sad part is they probably wouldnt even admit they *wanted* the level of difficulty they were *expecting*.
---
No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS No ChAnGeS
---
 I'll repeat this for your slow ass;
---
it's not about the damn gnomes, it's that if they're already getting this lazy and half assing something as basic as a character model, what else are they going to get lazy with and just half ass?
---
It's by far my favorite Cata zone, its gorgeous, has fantastic music and interesting quests. Only thing is, as someone with thalassophobia, it scares the living shit out of me. I can only quest so far into it before I have to nope out for fear of running into Kolorath.
---
Because it was very difficult and they weren't allowed to wipe due to fast respawn; they wanted to finish the challenging dungeon and they did it...they felt fulfillment and joy. It was impressive so they had all the reasons to screams. It's not hard to figure tbh...

No changes will put blizz in an easy position where they can just rerelease games.
---
We need games that continue on from classic
---
Last I heard it doesn't right now. There's a few bugs with seals in general.
---
Payo is so entertaining man
---
once you get out of the Shimmering Flats there's like 2 quest chains in the entire zone and only one of them has you even set foot in the water. It's mind boggling
---
I went into the MC anniversary instance all of once, cleared it in about an hour with zero deaths and that was the end of it. It was *very* LFR.
---
&gt; ...the heroes find a powerful relic that starts us on a alternate path to eventually defeat the Void Lords once and for all.
---
Not even needed IMO.  The end of Arthas should have been the end of the story, as it was the last of the worldbuilding left behind by WC3.  After WotLK it was time for Warcraft 4 to re-set the stage with fresh lore, new threats, new factions and alliances and whatever else.  Worldbuilding is a million times better when done in a single-player game than when trying to force it in an MMO.
---
Exactly, that's possible for sure. Just have to keep hitting the macro.
---
It doesn’t need to be said. It becomes obvious when someone suggests doing something a bit differently and the extreme min/maxers throw a tantrum and start insulting the individual and telling them they can’t do it there opinion is wrong essentially.
---
Let me repeat this slowly for you, as it's been addressed multiple times in this thread:
---
This is a screenshot from a private server. It's infinitely more likely that private servers didn't apply a scaling measurement that Vanilla WoW did, then to assume that the company is lying about something they could fix in about 3 seconds just to piss off antagonistic assholes like yourself.
---
But then, who knows. If I'm not frothing at the mouth about gnomes being too tall, I'm just a sheeple.
---
What ability did he use?
---
The suspense is killing me.
---
Yeah, definitely check out Tanaris while you're at it.
---
That's not going to stop gold sellers at all.
---
Mount at 40 is basically talk to two people, I think you’re thinking of the 60 epic mount
---
To break wind is to fart.
---
Thanks for the input. I know nothing about recent expansions
---
Why are you ignoring the 5 other people posting screenshots from vanilla/beta and showing an obvious difference?
---
I'm trying to stop complacent lazy fucks like you from making the game horrible again. Stop.
---
&gt;I mean, you don't play them like a warrior or a rogue.
---
Or any class with abilities. Shaman at least has frost shock, but the paladin stun is not worth due to will of the forsaken and trinkets to break stuns which are a hard requirement for L60 pvp.
---
I mean, [the amount of abilities](https://i.imgur.com/wfbOGOC.jpg) you have as warlock before specialised talent, trinket and profession builds is huge; also each class can have neat little tricks that can be pulled due to the fact that rank 1 spells cast faster than max rank spells. Ergo, you can use rank 1 frost bolts to slow your opponent and they can cast extremely quickly.
---
Also, I would argue that Engineering's usefulness quickly dwindles at high levels beyond bombs as the gear doesn't really keep up with the different tier sets.
---
A warlock can decide to swap a high level trinket out for an abyss shard to insta-summon a void walker paired with sacrifice demon to heal in combat. A paladin is typically going to run whatever maximises damage or mitigates damage, there is much less thought that can be put into the builds.
---
Don’t use down-ranked spells while leveling. The only reason to is when you have a lot of +healing, otherwise low-rank spells have less healing per mana.
---
What mounts are so rare a faction only has 3-5 after two years? The Baron one isn't that low of a drop chance right? 1% sounds about right. Winterspring is a brutal grind though. I only did it in NC after the nerf. If there is one that rare I'd love to hear about it lol.
---
I included my WoW history because it was a valuable reference point. 
---
For all I know 1kn was flooded out mid-TBC. I'm just some random person on reddit with a legitimate question, not trying to become some sort of influencer, and even if I was, you need to relax.
---
Appreciate all your hard work Melderon, ignore the naysayers. Your guides have helped me a lot in preparing to main a shaman!
---
On one hand, you think Blizzard's engineers are so incompetent that they'd screw up verifying such a straightforward bug report. Yet on the other hand, you're willing to stick around this subreddit since you think they have the capability actually release Classic WoW in playable form? That's a lot of cognitive dissonance right there.

Epic music..
---
This is the first act of EVERY save the day story ever. Mary sue character that is needed to save the world shrugs and continues chopping wood as he grunts ‘not my problem, I gave that life up a long time ago’
---
Mage is easier but warlock is more interesting: :')
---
Oh man I think you’re right..!
---
Some spells have DR on NPCs, like stuns.
---
Still it must be done. But it will certainly help stop gold buying cheaters.
---
I really don’t get (from a business point of view) why Blizzard isn’t charging for the game itself (like for WC3 remastered) and instead only for a subscription. 
---
Temporary interest looks like it’ll be huge but it’s pretty easy to predict that it won’t last as long this time around. The game is just to much of a time sink for new generations of gamers. I mean I’m not complaining - but, seems like Blizzard could have really cashed in here instead of releasing a free game. Most people will only buy a few months of sub time but everyone’s gonna try it out, even those that never played. The hype is huge (although maybe it’ll die down in the next three months - this whole release plan seems like it wasn’t properly thought through from a monetary perspective).
---
Nobody fucking caresssssss loser
---
I agree, I don’t think most people would search wow BFA. I was interested, so I looked up wow legion. It was around double of what classic is that right now.
---
They released BFA into a playable pile of shit.
---
I don't doubt they can get a working game out, but tweaking it to be what Vanilla once was? Will probably either require them copying an old server (Which they refuse to do, probably for legal reasons), or actually spending a few months and trying. 
---
I'm gonna continue calling them on their shit when it's wrong, because I want Classic WoW back. Not a shitty BFA clone.
---
Everything is a conspiracy right?
---
I’m not saying they are the majority, in fact, I would argue that the numbers are more like the top 1%.
---
I’m commenting on the idea that ironically if everyone was to min/max, Classic would become homogenised like retail which I believe is a valid insight.
---
Are you sure about it? 
---
[https://imgur.com/aEfDPwz](https://imgur.com/aEfDPwz)
---
It’s like wrestling.. you think it’s real when you’re
---
young and realize it’s staged as you get older. I think.. I hope.
---
Yep, at some point the big brain rogue class designers decided it made sense for the sneaking rogue to move at normal speed,  pairing that with a speed boost talent now makes you go faster in stealth.
---
They also gave like a rediculos 4 second grace period on being revealed or something stupid like that to get a stealth opener off, along with a few other things that just took made rogues unpunishable.
---
does vanilla have quest markers or no ?
---
People were more toxic on private servers on or classic servers? 
---
Boy I still remember a group of players that chewed me out in shattrath for asking a question 😢(private server)
---
Did you ever grind the elemental plateau? Netherwing rep? Skyguard rep? Any kind of node farming? Hang out at PvP vendors by arena areas? Duel outside shattrath? Kara? It wasn't dead at all.
---
&gt;Why are you ignoring the 5 other people posting screenshots from vanilla/beta and showing an obvious difference? 
---
Please feel free to link these obvious differences from confirmed Vanilla. 
---
&gt;I'm trying to stop complacent lazy fucks like you from making the game horrible again.
---
Yeah, what we need are most antisocial mean-spirited tools like yourself. That'll make the game prosper.
---
it's already been stated legacy servers will be a thing if there is the want for them
---
&gt; or actually spending a few months and trying. Tweaking until it's like Vanilla again, trial and error.
---
Is this not... exactly what they're doing?
---
dude.. why are you replying to me? are you fucking stupid? will a screenshot help you?
---
https://i.imgur.com/SNMa8uK.png
---
are you so fucking braindead that you can't understand the simple concept that on a private server they don't have "server side scripts" from blizzard? thats why every single private server is fucking dog shit mechanically, and thus they wouldnt have this SERVERSIDED model scaling in effect on any private server(where ur alleged 1.12 screenshot came from)
---
stop replying, please
---
I just want to point out they aren’t slippery slope fallacies, in fact many no changers acknowledge the fallacy when talking about no changes. The argument was that blizzard couldn’t be trusted and so don’t give an inch cause they will take a mile. The philosophy was based on mistrust not the slippery slope fallacy which states that if one thing happens another semi related thing is inevitable. That was never the argument, just that we need to pump it into blizzards brain that Vanilla is sacred. I think the community trusts them much more now and that’s why you don’t see no changers as much anymore.
---
It totally is, but that’s what makes Vanilla so great is that it’s a sandbox. Some people like to PvP, others PvE, others just trading, and others fishing.
---
The 1% won’t dictate how the other 99% act.
---
Yeah, like if they used all of the old raid content they never finished in vanilla that we all hoped would come at that time.  I could see the hardline nochangers coming around to that.  
---
Like hyjal, kharazan crypts, etc.  They could make them new raids or dungeons that offered side-grade gear(no more making gear obsolete through content updates is a requirement IMO), rare ground mounts, cool new ''classic'' boss mechanics, and whatever else they can think of that doesn't directly/negatively impact the "classic feel" of the game.  
---
It would be cool to have the 60 cap with new raid content.  Being able to choose between MC, hyjal, emerald dream, kharazan, etc, based on what gear you PREFER and not gear that is objectively better in every way, and which bosses you want to down.  It would keep the feeling of raiding fresh too.
---
Aren't the shards given only when gaining xp or honor? What does a lock do at 60 to get shards?
---
Modern graphical options, that's it for me personally.
---
Don't make me log on my main and/or call my guildies down here to counter-camp you!
---
For a bug ass mechanical sot I swear the Fel Reaver would come up behind you on tip-toes and --SPLAT--   you were jelly in his shoes.
---
G-D thing.  Once I hit 80 in Wrath would go back and just kill a few some vent my spleen.
---
What if they take an OSRS style approach and try adding content in the original Spirit of the game
---
https://i.imgur.com/fbl9IKO.jpg
---
Here's a picture of the guide book from the original world of warcraft discs. 
---
&gt;I'm gonna reply to you but stop replying
---
Lol, no. If you want to stop, you stop. You're still wrong.
---
This is fucking gold. Not reddit gold though I don’t have money for that shit, but gold nonetheless.
---
Highly highly recommend you start with the classic route of northshire -&gt; elwynn -&gt; westfall -&gt; redridge -&gt; duskwood. 
---
It should take you all the way from lvl 1 to about ~30. (Don’t forget the lighthouse quests in southwest westfall).
---
My friend and I have done these zones to completion dozens and dozens of times throughout our pre-cata wow careers. They never get old. These zones may not be the most optimized for min max levelers, but they have a lot of character. And it’s the old-school alliance, not the modern goodie two-shoe alliance. It’s a timeless experience
---
&gt;Gnomes are the correct height
---
Nope. 
---
I'm all for making things easy for blizzard, but the hardest part is getting the community to come to a 100% conclusion about something.  
---
I truly and fully believe, as a vanilla veteran all the way through WOTLK, that adding new content to classic would be a way better timeline than the expansion heavy, welfare gear, instant gratification, making raid gear obsolete every expansion type timeline.
---
balls deep
---
Whilst I do love Boat Day... fuck I do notove all that water
---
I mean maybe. Could be cool. Could be horrible. No telling until if/ when it happens.
---
Every zone in classic had such character.
---
Man I think Ironforge is awesome, and I rather like Stormwind too, but I'm Horde for life. I love old Orgrimmar and Undercity too (wish more people hung out in UC but I understand) so it's not a major conflict for me, but man sometimes it'd be nice to disguise myself as a dwarf and chill in their city for a little while.
---
You have to remember that not only was WoW launched later in the EU, but that most vanilla players didn't start at the launch. Only a very small minority of vanilla players actually played for a long time without bgs.
---
My inner alliance is disgusted, but my appreciation for wow art is very impressed nice work!
---
After 15 years of World of Warcraft blizzard has probably learned a thing or two about curtailing gold sellers. Granted they will not be using tokens as a part of that strategy, but there are plenty of other things they can do. It also falls to us to report those things.
---
True, but what would you wanna see other than graphics?
---
That 1.12 client is connected to a pserver.
---
\&gt;TBC and Northrend were awesome continents that idk how they would of done flying.  
---
Yeah they were awesome, but I would be willing to sacrifice a bit of their awesomeness to take out flying mounts because the negatives from flying are far greater than the awesomeness of those zones.  They could redesign the zones, make more flightpaths, or whatever else they could think of to promote ground movement.
---
You had one job
---
it's just awfully convienent and cozy and sometimes I stealth in and chill for a bit and only kill 1, maybe 2, lowbies
---
Pretty sure that didnt get implimented until WotLK. Definitely wasn't around in vanilla.
---
They tweaked the values during beta. These were printed before that.
---
Yeah that would be sick but the new content also has to make sense lore wise and not contradict the lore in retail wow.
---
I do like how in OSRS the community votes in an in game poll on which updates make it into the game or not which is a pretty good protective measure against what happened in runescape back in 2012 and cataclysm in WoW
---
Where ya getting the info that it won’t be in classic?
---
ungodly cringe
---
please end urself
---
I totally remember that happening too. 
---
I’m with you.
---
Hahaha, this horde one is for him, the alliance one I do will be for me!
---
I have the same problem (severe thalassophobia) and I could never handle Vashj'ir. I never even liked any water quests that required me to swim out a ways from the shore or especially swim down into the water.
---
The fact that doing this pretend thing on my computer made me feel so unsettled and uncomfortable is what made me realize how bad my phobia really is. It's pretty goofy.
---
When I said both slippery slope fallacies and thinking Blizzard couldn’t do it I am referring to 2 different lines of thinking within the community. There has indeed been plenty of people who have replied to posts wanting to see something like the unfinished Vanilla zones with comments like “oh what’s next? Flying mounts and LFD? NO CHANGES!”
---
Payo is a fucking psychopath
---
It be great if they ask us what we would like just like osrs
---
No.
---
&gt; I'm not mean to other players in the game, because they're usually on the side of "Make the game better, I'm not bindly defending a corporation"
---
Do you think I don't play WoW because you disagree with me lmao?
---
&gt;BFA is a shitty game. We want Classic WoW back.
---
Cool. In your mind, yelling at players and telling them to distrust everything Blizzard says will make Blizzard "stop being lazy" and make a good game (?), and in my mind, that's fucking lunacy. Nice screenshot, though, thanks.
---
Holy shit of course!!! Please Blizzard!!! Give us our blood back!
---
In Mulgore I grouped with 3 other level 5s to do a quest that required killing a level 12 Goblin in a cave full if level 8-10 goblins. We had to pull carefully and play to the best of our limited ability, but it paid off. Ended up getting a 2h mace that was almost twice the DPS of the white vendor mace with +2 strength. Afterwards I helped 2 other groups complete the quest.
---
It was some of the most fun I've had playing WoW in years and definitely one the most memorable moments.
---
Yes you’re correct and I’m not worried about that happening.
---
As mentioned prior, was more harping on about the irony.
---
That's great can't wait to see that one
---
&gt;They tweaked the values during beta. 
---
..... Yep. So it's time to put them back to the Classic values.
---
from different census on both light hope and nostalrius this is wrong but hey will see
---
Your screenshot basically destroys your own argument. BfA searching  saw an identical spike when it was new, then fell off after launch. Why do you think Classic is any different?
---
??    
---
I haven't seen any real min/maxer give a shit what someone does unless it's a player trying to force themselves into groups/content they aren't ready for
---
you knoe it would be trivial to imppement a group finder addon yeah
---
I'm not yelling at players though, I'm telling people who are blindly saying "OH OKAY :D!" without actually checking the fucking results (Which were wrong). 
---
You are going to end up letting the devs be lazy and ruin the game. Stop. Call them on their shit, or stop defending laziness and lies. 
---
They tweaked the values during beta.
---
Rep grind is basically leveling.  Of course PvP will happen during that or **any open world activity**.  The problem is, adding these instant-gratification type PvP things to the game takes away from any and all reason to go searching for PvP in the **open world.**
---
Look at gurubashi arena.  That place literally spawns wars in STV.  We need more cool game mechanics like that, not stale robotic kill grinds in instanced zones.  I want the game to feel more like WARcraft and not INSTANCEcraft.
---
Gnomezilla!
---
Bachelor of Fine Arts
---
Yes and there can be easily that one person (that happened a lot in retail) that rings the gong at times that completely fuck over other people
---
What are those numbers in multiples of?
---
Loved “Leap of Faith” quest as a troll mage with slow fall!
---
I noticed General and LocalDefense channels were not active in Westfall on the stress test. Not a big deal tho...
---
Sure. We can use beta values. Taurens will get plainsrunning and hunters will have focus.
---
He didn't say it ONLY applied to starting zones. He said it applied to starting zones, which is something Kevin Jordan also said.
---
Did Taurens still have plainsrunning in 1.12?
---
Nope. Nice try though.
---
Not everyone is expected to be a min/maxer but nobody can complain if they are left out of groups because they aren't optimized.
---
There are plenty of groups of people in all different types of level of hardcore / casual.
---
I found this album someone posted of vanilla wow screenshots in this subreddit a while back that had a good amount of gnome featured screenshots that we can use probably, there are some with the gnome as the PC
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7bh4pc/a_ton_of_screenshots_from_vanilla_wow/
---
I miss shaman having water breathing. I can't for the life of me figure out why they removed it.
---
It would make him money if he was somehow able to get an early lionsheart recipe though. But definitely not worth going just to try for that though
---
I feel they would need to have entirely new paths after classic to avoid confusion. I also think going off world makes the game seem small too. Every new comer will never really see anyone until they get to the end game
---
Especially when you’re deep in a non-instanced dungeon -_-
---
That's definitely Joe!
---
It was good for 1 time. I had a mistake playing it two times. I felt corenered and forced to make it through quest-chains, plus it's all super-phased.
---
And not all of them helped make the olympics.
---
&gt; While i recognize flying is one of the first QoL changes and altered the game significantly
---
Has "QoL change" lost all meaning? It seems like people just say any change they don't like is a "QoL change".
---
Flying is not a QoL change, and even if it was there were QoL changes in every vanilla patch (e.g. MC attunement, shard bags).
---
&gt;They tweaked the values during beta.   
---
That would be ***original*** beta that happened in 2004.
---
&gt;without actually checking the results / claims from blizzard. (Which were wrong).
---
They've showed multiple times they have a running 1.12 reference client. You've shown a private server screenshot and someone's cell phone pic of a storyboard. Congratulations on "proving" it.
---
Perfect is subjective. Some think mechanics are overrated, some thing the grind is overrated.
---
Yeah, a lot of people jump to crazy conclusions.  I get it though, because of how Blizzard is and how the dev/community interaction can be skewed and introduce some garbage shit.  
---
This is why we need direct talks about the things we WANT added/removed with objective/logical influence, and to also have open and real discussions about how these things might affect the game.
---
In Vanilla, the fastest gate opening was 19 days. The fastest scepter crafting was 7 days. You have to wait 5 days after the War Effort event ends before you can bang the gong. No guild that has a scepter before the gates open is going to miss out on the mount.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
I hear ya. I usually cant do water quests, but Vashj'r is just so good that I have to do the first part. BUT...I stay wayyyy on the bottom of the ocean floor because I'm scared of the whale sharks and Velskar.
---
By any chance do you play Horde and if so, have you done the war campaign? If not, consider this fair warning that if you ever do, there's a straight up terrifying quest you have to do...I had to leave the room and have someone do it for me, lol.
---
You can be, you'd just have to pay the price for farming gold to deal with that
---
Yeah I agree. I was just looking through my old wow screenshots and found my lvl 60 ding picture. Almost 21 days played to get to 60. 500 hours and at 5 hours a day that would be 100 days. The biggest reason it took that long was because I stopped to play a lot of bgs that didn't give xp. Can't do that now in classic.
---
&gt;cell phone pic of a storyboard
---
It's the Booklet that comes with the original WoW discs. Stop making up bull-shit when you realize you're wrong.
---
Oh, well that's incorrect.
---
They're using the models from BFA.
---
Na I did as well. Most people I knew spiced up their bank alts a little bit.
---
Agreed
---
Never understood anybody who’s a fan of that incel
---
I’m not reading all of this.  I heard you say there is nothing wrong with difficulty levels and instantly know we won’t see eye to eye.
---
There is nothing wrong with this, but not for MMOs.  MMOs have always followed a certain standard until wow ruined it because it was top dog.
---
If you don’t put the time into an mmo you shouldn’t be seeing end content at all no matter the level.  Period
---
Can we use the screenshots in this thread to compare with classic?
---
They're vanilla screenshots posted previously in this subreddit and there are some gnomes featured
---
I would've killed to see them live back in the day! I never knew why they ended up splitting, I just remember them getting a new singer and then falling apart. Then half the group (the brothers and the singer I believe?) formed The Unguided with a similar sound. Not sure what they're up to these days
---
Sex worker here. I take it from behind with my laptop in front of me.
---
I think Blizz has stated that they're open to creating new content off of the classic platform if classic WoW gets popular enough. I think it'd be an amazing idea. A lot of threads about it have been made and people have given some interesting suggestions, which indicates that classic could really extend the lifespan of WoW for a long time because there is indeed a lot of cool stuff they could do. 
---
I'd love for there to be additional caverns of time instances which allow us to explore alternate scenarios and the like.
---
Slow flying mounts wouldn't make sense in a realistic setting. If they need flying maybe its on a cooldown or for a certaint amount of time

There is a difference between completely remaking something (such as Starcraft, or WC3 remastered) and essentially re-releasing something that most of us have already bought.  Besides, the goal for this business model, I imagine, is that someone would subscribe, and play either modern or classic, and then try the other.  Win-win for Blizzard.
---
Blizzard-activision gets enough shit for some of their business decisions; I am glad that they seemed to have thought this one through.
---
Yep.  Flying mounts just take too much away from the game just like any other bad QoL implementation they added.  
---
I would love to have classic post Naxx new content, level 60 cap, new side-grade gear, new ground mounts, open world PvP content(capturable bases that provide gold), raids like Hyjal, emerald dream, kharazan crypts...so much they could do that would make the game more amazing.
---
IS HE THE BOMB THIS TIME
---
I'm so excited to get to go out of bounds again in the vanilla world
---
If it's not broken then maybe related to layering?  Respawning in the wrong layer or something
---
I can't find any good photos comparing gnome height to something close like  a Dwarf, but I 100% support your idea of using screenshots from Vanilla to compare and see the truth.

That’s super funny because my dad started in Everquest as well. That’s so awesome that he does that and has kept up contact with friends he met online so long ago. I was a social bee in the game when I was playing vanilla, I just wanted to talk to everyone lol. Love it!
---
First 3 days would be fine by me.
---
No point go cry over it. Go argue politics if you disagree with this point
---
An auctioneer must look the part!
---
When BC came out I grinded rep on my human to get the elikk mount.  The quests gave full xp but I still needed thousands of runecloth to get it.
---
Worth it. 
---
So it was possible in BC but I'm not sure about 1.12
---
AHHH UHHHH
---
Can someone confirm if soulshards disappear on logging out, i.e. acting as a conjured item? Mostly found conflicting information on this in threads like this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/adlcqb/could_warlocks_put_soul_shards_in_their_bank/
---
well, it kind of makes sense. When bfa was new people added it to the search, but now that its been out there's no real need to add "bfa" to the google search for most situations
---
The reason why people call flying a QoL change is because it gave into the instant gratification thing that most of blizzard's QoL changes gave to players that ended up making the game shitty.
---
The community wanting different things is why modern/retail wow is like how it is.  Casual vs. hardcore, essentially.
---
RIP title lmao
---
It's the beard.
---
I would always take a bg break from leveling at the '8's and 9's to PvP. But I ran a ton of dungeons so I had good gear. No fancy enchants but it was fun to kill twinks, lol. Can't wait to get back!!!!
---
They want something for retail players to do in between content droughts to keep subscription numbers up. Many many retail players wouldnt play if it had a box price.
---
Lmao I didnt even know "Sonic Syndicate" was still around producing music after everyone left. I love The Unguided too and glad they stuck with their sound, but the OG Sonic Synidcate albums (Only Inhuman, Love and Other Disasters) will always be the best :)
---
Mainly PvP, but I'll give the raids a re-visit to see if it feels less like a chore this time around.
---
Yes.  Classic devs confirmed that if you own the original wow CE, then you can re-claim your pet in classic.
---
Hindsight is 20/20.  
---
The community wanted shit because it sounded cool/better for their experience at the time.  They didn't know that it would eventually lead to a stale, lifeless WoW.  The struggle is what makes WoW classic so...important feeling.
---
Honestly I wouldn't have any problems with flying if they made it not safe. Like they have added few items in the retail that allows you to dismount people but they are mostly useless since you need to be on the ground to use them. Add a way to force someone down to fight without either of you needing separate slowfall to not die to fall damage and it could work.
---
Sentry Totem, is best totem.
---
I believe so. Pretty sure saw a post of this recently and a dev confirmed.
---
Awesome, thanks for the quick response!
---
PvE. I love PvP, but only in games dedicated and built around it like EVE Online where there are actual consequences and rewards for risking those consequences.
---
My plan is to roll Hunter, blast my way to 60, and use the Hunter mainly to farm with and MAYBE do some T0.5 and T1 stuff with.  However, I cannot escape the fact that I am much, much better at Warlock, and enjoy playing it more (especially in PVP), so I will be steadily leveling a Lock "alt" with rested experience on the side, which will probably be "ready to go" a couple of months after launch.
---
If I were to talk you out of rolling Hunter, I would need to know what your character will be focused on.  PVE?  Organized PVP?  World PVP?  Gold hoarding?  Leveling speed?
---
Nice, thank you!
---
I work in a proprietary IT job for a fiance analytics company. I work from home 4 nights a week and if its quiet I can boot up WoW on the side on my personal laptop and do casual stuff.
---
Blizzard changed the way their game data is stored years ago, anyways. None of these old game discs would be of any use nowadays.
---
Of course.  At the time, everyone loved the changes.  But all the changes, collectively, kinda made a mess of things.
---
Heavy Dynamite, from Engineering.
---
If you're going to PvP, you'll want Engineering.
---
The Baron mount was changed to 1% in patch 3.0.2 (WotLK). It will be the original 0.02% in WoW Classic. That means your chances of ever having seen it drop don’t hit above 50% until ~4000 runs.
---
both.
---
mainly, i want to PvE for T2/T3 and Benediction. 
---
i'm almost thinking about rolling on a PvE server, tho, so i can farm in peace for raids. i plan on maining a Holy Priest 100%.
---
This video shows clearly the height difference between female gomes and male dwarves https://youtu.be/1NbBpp90coQ
---
Can someone on the beta compare?
---
These quillboar won't kill themselves ya know.
---
Oh hahah cool, thanks!
---
I never understood the no changes crowd for buffing shitty specs.
---
It seems the only standing ground is "That's just how shit went, I want it the exact same"
---
it seems like it would only be cool if shitty specs were brought to be a little better? The fact that people just accept there are specs that getting carried throughout raids and are fine with that seems insane to me. Don't even touch the good specs, just make the bad ones better!
---
&gt; Play undead lock to be superior than alliance locks and win the mirror match 
---
You assume everyone actually cares about PVP with this statement.
---
If he does care about PVP, Horde locks are far superior, but if he is PVE focused, ally locks are often under-represented and are always in demand for their utility in the early tiers and DPS in the later ones.
---

---
His orange head pops up all over the world unfortunately, lol 😫
---
PvE server for me. I dislike being ganked while leveling up. I might dabble in BG's however.
---
Flying allows everyone to get around way easier. And almost negates all world pvp. Only lately has blizz prevented flying in end game zones. But they always bring it back in the end
---
Its a quality of life change
---
Slow flying was literally in TBC, it was the intial flying you got just to reach stuff... then it upgraded to 150% and then 280% and then 310% (if my memory serves me)
---
Went looking for my old expansion boxes and found my classic box with the CD, game manual, and a couple 10 day free trials inside of it.
---
But...
---
Strange. My buddy in classic is not getting the full reputation. What quest did you do? How large was the level gap?
---
https://i.imgur.com/MGKYUCO.png
---
Whatever content gets added must be horizontal progression and not vertical progression and making no level increases.
---
The fundamental flaw with Retail is that they kept piling on expansions, one on top of the other. What makes 1-60 so great is that level 60s have to inhabit the same zones as level 10s. As soon as expansion content pulls the endgame out of the 1-60 world, any MMO is going to be diminished.
---
Mine was a level 1 twink. I would duel other bank alts in Ironforge. Hey Blizzard, let us duel in Ironforge.
---
Yeah, my Warrior has executioner from TBC. I played with him for a little bit into TBC. Kill me
---
You call them min maxxers but this isn't like a live MMO
---
The reason it's more restrictive is because we already know how the "expansion" is gonna play out. So what was acceptable in most semi hardcore guilds becomes unacceptable. There is too much info out there. 
---
If we were in any other MMO that awsnt' just emulating old content you can do a great many things as long as you're attempting to do your job as a raider.
---
But in Vanilla we know certain specs not only suck, but are going to suck. It's not the same
---
Empty raid slots are viable all the way through naxx. That in no way proves any spec is viable. 
---
Maintaining standards that force basic buffs is impossible if your fury warriors see ret paladins on the DPS meters and hear them talking about their mana. 
---
I'm not talking 100% buffed to the hilt with 100g a week spent. I'm talking basic consumes. Because that warrior will need basically no consumes to out DPS that ret paladin.
---
Only way to do it is let them raid and give htem no loot prio so they get nothing. Otherwise you're just shitting on the 35+ dudes who are in the right spec and buffed
---
Yep yep.

Is this guy playing WoW in a freaking football stadium? Nice.
---
(*)
---
Never again.
---
Disagree. Try being the one bad guy in the community arguing that flying, no matter how “cool,” will actually be a bad design decision.
---
Hi, /u/taifunzera
---
Yeah this guy [deleted] just posts the same shit everywhere.
---
Can you elaborate on point 5 please?
---
&gt; a pretty good protective measure against what happened in runescape back in 2012 and cataclysm in WoW
---
Until you realize that players begged for flying and LFD to mitigate the fact that making dungeon groups manually was impossible when leveling through TBC just to get to Cataclysm endgame where everyone already was.
---
It's one of my goals.
---
I mean I can’t speak for everyone but I’m gonna play classic but wouldn’t touch retail with a ten foot pole. Also I’m not so sure there’s a difference between remaking and rereleasing WC3 and classic? They’re both essentially the same games just with updated graphics. 
---
Just thinking that Blizzard maybe didn’t perfectly anticipate what’s going to happen with Classic. No one knows for sure yet, but it wouldn’t be the first time they didn’t quite anticipate what people want.
---
Ik it existed but I'm saying it made sense because you eventually mounted faster beasts. And it made sense that they were faster.
---
If they release slower mounts than the flight masters then itd be weird.
---
Id rather live in a world where we just cant ride them for some fantasy reason
---
Participation trophy transmog hero vs school of hard knocks
---
Try playing from Australia :S
---
I agree that that seems like the vision. My point is I’m not sure if that’s how it’ll play out. 
---
I think it’s becoming more obvious that there’s a huge base of people who want classic only and have no interest in ever playing retail.
---
You’ll find out on August 12th when we can all pick servers and create up to 3 characters per account.
---
Are we counting welfare gear as the ability to buy older tier when a new raid comes out? Or any gear available like in TBC?
---
....uh what?
---
It's awesome man. We all have ideas that start somewhere. Most people never follow up for whatever reason. Props to you. Needs a vilian though.
---
yeah dont they know memory starts at age 20

---
And guess what? It's pretty much exactly 15% -- the amount gnome models are supposed to be scaled in the game world. [Scaling the private server gnome to 115%](https://i.imgur.com/o6ZkOVC.jpg) makes him about the same size as the original classic gnomes.

That’s not the group I’m referring to in the post so I can see why you’re confused.
---
It's actually a perfect reenactment, right down to the AFK part.
---
I agree.
---
Although I can’t imagine anybody actually complaining about that. It would be funny to see though haha. LET ME IN!
---
and some people are ok with polished shit.
---
It will for sure be interesting to see how it pans out, assuming they progress to TBC. I am not a fan of them just copying TBC / WOTLK / Etc and calling it a day. They need to correct the mistakes of the past and release that content with the pillars of Vanilla.
---
the little payo forgets the little flag ofc
---
The most broken one is some of the female alliance models can just hop right through teh fucking fence in WSG lol
---
So broken
---
As to whether or not it'll be in the game IDK.....They were not considered exploits or bugs unless it requires noggenflogger/light fall generally on private servers. And usually they tried to take the same positions as vanilla mods when they had proof that's how they handled it. 
---
Maybe gnome male can do it too, idk never seen one do it.
---
RemindMe! 96 days “dooo eeet”
---
Classic is a bigger event for people who are not interested in mmorpgs than bfa is.
---
A player who hates mmorpgs but love RTS games will be more interested in Blizzard bringing back a 15 year old game than new content.
---
No kidding! I subscribed hoping for a beta invite and when I logged into retail my buddy invited me to a group from another server and before I knew it he was next to me. From another server. What?
---
PVE server and lots of BG's. I love pvp but ganking/being ganked gets old fast and it slows progression
---
Don’t you get it? 
---
Get the disease, pay up to Blizzard to get rid of it! 
---
At least that’s what you think, pal..
---
“Paying” them actually unleashes an even more potent version of the disease. 
---
🧟‍♂️

I've recently been getting back into editing just doing a project here and there for my parents and family friends and I had forgotten how much I enjoy it. Maybe I'll channel my energy from my lust for classic into finishing the machinima I never even started lol.
---
Thanks though. May blizzard bless you with the gift of Beta.
---
Lol, good luck with BWL. That guild ain't gonna last long if you care about progressing through.
---
Chinese farmers/bots *have* made absurd amounts of gold in some areas by stacking...
---
I really liked this explanation in a thread about how hard BWL is going to be:
---
&gt; “...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs.”

he uses green screen backgrounds
---
I just want them to finish all the unused content (karazhan crypt, hyjall, gilneas, etc) in a distinctly classic way
---
Hillsbrad in Cata was pretty good as well (at least I thought it was horse side, idk about alliance).
---
They would just need to make a fresh server.
---
 RemindMe! 96 days "doo diss"
---
What does Retail mean in relation to Classic?
---
But now we have seen what it leads to. The player base should be more informed than it was back then. Yes, should, but maybe not.
---
Most of the time, I used to send the not-bound event dresses to my bank alts to gear them :)
---
Fun is back on the menu boys
---
Please update us!
---
Tbc content without level increase
---
You nailed it. Flying mounts, while convenient, ruined a certain aspect of wow forever.
---
camera distance yes, you can see the enemy from super far away and even click on them. but no nameplates until they get close.
---
Np
---
They are less of a problem than the sunshine and sugar kisses crowd that says play a protection specced priest and you can tank naxx, causing people to have unrealistic expectations. MinMaxxers most attack blatant liars about what is the top optimized builds for the game, they are basically stating mathematical truths. I've never seen a post about "play my spec or else" it's more like "i only want to associate with optimized players" vs "will people be jerks to me if i  slow them down on purpose?"
---
The average playerbase are not game designers and judging by some of the terrible ideas I've seen get popular on r/wow and r/classicwow, I shudder at the thought of letting the community start voting on what changes to make.
---
Remember how people wanted all specs to be viable? That idea alone is responsible for so many things people hate about retail. What does good design even mean in that context?
---
I just want to point out that OSRS requires ~75% to vote in favor of something for it to pass. Do you think there is a chance that 75% of the player base will make the wrong decision? I'm not claiming to be for one or the other, i'm still undecided.

I’m so over seeing “world first” titles.
---
"Muh utility" &lt; optimized raid composition with skilled players. Instead of a subpar dps using 30% of his mana on 1 heal, and having 3 of these you could take 3 pures, 2 dps and a healer, they deal 4 times the damage and that one healer heals for more than those 3 retardadins would.
---
I believe if they kept flying at 60speed it would have had possibly a bit less of a negative effect while allowing flying and instances exclusive to owners.
---
I agree with the sentiment, it needs to go ASAP. Every server will have a different timeline as to when it will need to go but I suspect they will do them in batches.
---

I would venture to guess that any recipe learned from a trainer will be available as it was in 1.12.

Yeah I absolutely loved this area. My orc warrior peaked here.  I made it to shimmering flats which is where my wow career ended.
---
All my memories are here and I really can’t wait to get back into it.
---
hahahahahaha
---
My first character and the server I plan to raid and PvP on will be a PvP server.
---
I do plan to roll a couple of alts on the opposite faction, but I'll do that later down the track on a PvE server.
---
WHAT
---
THE
---
FUCK?
---
Very bold unpopular opinion. I think you may actually be the first one to let everyone know that the minmaxers are in denial, you know how to have fun but they actually do not have fun EVER. They think they do, but they dont. Good job and I applaud your efforts on contributing to being a part of the all inclusive, everyone has a right to their own opinion, classic community. However, we must remember to shun the minmaxers into conforming towards our beliefs. For their beliefs are actually incorrect, only while playing casual can you theoretically enjoy the game. Have fun in classic everyone, yes that includes everyone! (except for those with different opinions of course hehe xD :P)
---
you wouldn't be doing it 16h a day if you colluded like every private server does, running premades though
---
GTFO

Can't wait for the supercut of Asmon raids getting dunked on by frost mages

---
The problem is that you haven't defined what *wrong decision* is, and you haven't defined what *good game design* is. For me, having all specs be viable is actually bad game design, because classes in Vanilla were not designed with that paradigm in mind. 
---
But most players think that having specs be so imbalanced is *bad game design* and they might be right, considering the meme that TBC was “when WoW finally left beta.”
---
Finally, OSRS voting system is a total meme. Anyone who plays OSRS knows it's become a formula for casuals to ruin the game while serious OSRS players always complain about the polling system and Jagex ends up forcing updates anyways.
---
Furthermore, ask any OSRS player about PvMers voting no to PvP updates and vice-versa pretty much out of spite.
---
Who here mind controlled people off the elevators? 😂 😂 😂
---
PvP. Spent vanilla ganking people on PvP server as a rogue. Will spend classic ganking people as fite durid. Playing on a PvE server just seems like playing WoW with training wheels, quite frankly.
---
&gt;4 Str 4 Stam leather belt?
---
I am an oldschool vanilla guy and I usually find all the oldies funny, but I just didn't get that 1 or find it funny.
---
Wc3 is a remake, redoing mechanics and everything to make it more modern. The goal of classic wow is the opposite. Anyone that paid for wow (especially when you had to buy the base game as well as current expansion) has already purchased wow classic.
---
I think you're talking about mitigating how it made the world feel smaller, but even that isn't the biggest issue. Flying mounts effectively place you into a separate instance from the rest of the world.
---
There's no interaction between players on flying mounts other than chat. It killed non-forced WPvP. It made it easier to avoid ganking and the danger of being out in the world.
---
Dug mine out too, added them to my desk for decoration, and used the box cover to set on my wall. I cut the cover and crafted backing do that it's openable. So you can walk up to it and open it up. Simple but pretty neat.

This is a good idea to take a poll. I don’t think anyone has done this yet.
---
Yeah I guess but it is still a barrier to entry to the bfa players, though. They know that their sub numbers are dwindling heavily and I think the main thing they're probably trying to do now is just raise sub numbers and Classic is definitely a way to do that.
---
The fullscreen glow? If that's what you mean wow has had that since at least tbc but i think it was vanilla too. Pservers have it. I think blizz dialed it up in one of the recent expansions though...
---
/console ffxglow 0
---
That'll disable the bloomy, blurry fullscreen glow. That one is the biggest offender.
---
There isn't a huge base. It's a trivially small base compared to the amount of people subbed to retail.

Keep thinking you're anything more than a loud minority, though.

Its going to take most people 3-6 months just to level to 60.
---
Sounds like this relys on private server data, and isn’t accurate, as a result.
---
I was wondering about this! Thanks for clearing that up. I thought they legit did remove them for some reason.
---
Yes! You can. Just talk to Chromie! Hmm.. maybe I should talk to Chromie about my IRL struggles like .........
---
So not impossible.
---
There is also Classic WoW Guilds discord:

From what I head, you have to be on a different F&amp;F List for Classic Beta. Also it seems F&amp;F is worthless back in this days now. I mean almost everyone is F&amp;F now, sadly.
---
So I dont get my hopes up. I am on the List since 2016 or so.
---
PvP
---
Yeah, you can switch trinkets and weapons/shields/offhands in combat
---
Not everyone will want to reroll fresh when they haven't cleared naxx yet. Without new content Classic will lose players over time
---
let's just all vote tauren
---
I would prefer world without them , just to make that clear, but a simple solution as making them slower and  less effective than ground mounts would make them less used. Maybe a throw able net from eng usable on flying  mounts to force them down could somehow again make it bit less of a problem as it would possibly make it even more dangerous than mount grounds. This is all just random thoughts ok;) i like your opinions

No. Just no. Go read facts not 14 year old fiction.
---
Yeah it's kind of a weird angle but they look close enough to me.
---
he used to actually stream from there tho
---
Hardcoding the scale into the model doesn't make sense anyway. Every object has a scale value associated with it (even the 2D objects that make up your UI). Since the same model can be used in different contexts by changing scale, if you suddenly change the original model that will mess with all the objects that use that model.
---
For example, let's say you have a bunch of wolves at 1.0 scale. In a cave nearby there is a big mama wolf elite at 1.3 scale. Suddenly some intern looks at this mama wolf. He doesn't understand why it's 1.3 scale so he scales up the original model and sets the mama wolf to 1.0 scale. As a result of this, now all the other wolves are as big as the mama wolf.
---
It's not only unnecessary, but it also creates problems.
---
Love it. Keep it up!
---
Go 59 with 9 others on your faction and 10 on enemy faction. Instant BG q and can get rank 14.
---

---
Also, Naxx/AQ40 are definitely not hard at all compared to Retail mechanically, but the amount of time you have to spend gearing up for the year preceding them + the amount of time you have to spend farming consumables outweigh any amount of effort you have to put into Normal/Heroic raiding in BFA (Actual Mythic progression definitely harder and higher effort though, ofc). It's still mechanically more challenging, but late-Vanilla like AQ40/Naxx is higher effort than anything other than Mythic.
---
Hunter Druid, the amount of slippery bullshit that combo can pull off is nuts.
---
This, I never use immo until endgame. I'll just throw 1 shadowbolt instead after dots start. Always seems to work fine for me
---
Lock if ally
---
Oh my god, he just went in!
---
Well, I am curious, what happen, with "us" if we have 2 PTRs, technically I have PTR + Stress-Test so curious, if this fucks up things.
---
But I feel you are on the same "Low Priority" List then me lol. I am on Terran's List but sometimes I feel, we wont see a invite in the near future xD
---
I’m not even interested in who is worse than who.
---
Was simply stating that it would be ironic if classic became as homogenised as retail through min/maxing.
---
I don’t think it will happen, it’s just an observation that I think merits some discussion/a bit of fun.
---
Yeah but unlike your dad, Classic came back after 15 years.
---
If they were slow, most people would just use ground mounts to get to where they want to go, and use flying mounts for shortcuts or to get to flying only places.
---
That's how the system should work, rather than having everyone fly everywhere.
---
lock&gt;mage&gt;hunter
---
Are you talking about the R14 gear? Because that takes about 10x the effort that raiding does.
---
Negatory batman. Small town in Western Michigan circa 06'

They are using patch 1.12 data. L2google. The patch number and release schedule has been available for a little while, now.
---
Yo how you have 12g at 5 haha
---
Ok, so either I’m losing my mind or reputation decay was just put into effect as of today’s WSG patch. Because 10 hours ago, I wasn’t seeing any reputation decay. Now, I’m seeing it in all quests that are 6+ levels lower than my level.
---
Here are the XP/rep values I recorded for my level 9 human, tested within the past hour:
---
9
---
[2] Kobold Camp Cleanup Gray 100xp, 66SW (40% loss xp and rep)

---
[1] Encrypted Letter 15xp, 22SW (60% loss xp and rep)

---
Definitely taking a week off work for launch, maybe two.
---
from what I've heard is that it's like a character he put on but idk shits just a myth at this point right
---
* Karazhan was intended to be the 'catchup' 20 man raid for Nax, like ZG is for BWL, and AQ 20 is for AQ 40. Seems easy to suggest bringing it in to fill that space.
---
* For future content, there was all sorts of stuff planed at one point.. Hellfire peninsula, Mount Hyjal, Emerald Dream as new zones, Azshara fleshed out, content added to the few islands in Kalimdor that were kinda forgotten. CoT, Grim Batol, Hyjal, Azshara, Darkmaw hold as easy places for new instances. There is even some Dragon Isle stuff in the game files.
---
* As loot, side grade loot could flesh out the 'lesser' specs. Imagine a paladin tank gear set, where the set bonuses give judgement a taunt, or the mana from heals brought in later. Lots of cool ways to make dead specs viable.
---
* If we wanted verticle progression, more difficulty then naxx, you could obviously bring in some of the actually much more difficult live style raids. You could go a complete different direction too, and do things like increase the boss's level (messing with hit and def caps). 
---
* There are a lot of fights already that really 'force' you to have certain classes or specs, this could be followed even more interestingly. You could tinker with bosses to require a prot paladin, or a feral tank, or more hunters.  This is how a lot of classic was designed: "what is class ____ bringing to this fight".
---
* Every class should probably have an epic quest at 60... rip Druids, rogues, mages and shaman here.
---
yeah, like RP-PVP !!
---
The first sentence you wrote would have been sufficient enough but thank you.
---
There's a 10 hour window when the mount can be obtained after a ~20 day event and a ~7 day guild quest (requires a lot of 40-man raiding). Any guild that completes the quest and turns it in during that 10 hour window (the timer starts when the first guild turns it in) will get the mount (for one person). After that, no more mount.
---
Did I hear Bloodthirsty Instinct?
---
Would human lock be fine?
---
Is a lock cancer to level?
---
Back in vanilla I kept a bank full of them in case I couldn't farm for raid night. They were never a conjured item
---
WC3 is an ancient game.
---
Not sure, honestly. I ran on a PVE server, which had plenty of wpvp until BG's became a thing. I do like to just chill and quest from time to time without having to be bothered by some scrub trying to gank me. It's nothing about a cha;;enge, per se, I just like to not have to bother with it, sometimes. Plenty of pvp happens on pve servers. Plus, i get the feeling most streamers will be on pvp servers, which is even more reason to avoid them like the plague.
---
This is going to happen in Classic except we're going to see people from BFA luuul
---
I would say lock is the third best leveling class in the game only ones better are hunter and mage.
---
This is why in original vanilla on my hunter main I just keybound pet attack and pet passive to attack the target and call him back as needed. Defensive mode won't work until you are hit, aggressive will just go by proximity. This is how it was.
---
No it's super easy and fun. It's a magic hunter that uses death magic!
---
That’s one way to completely miss the point but hey, you do you man.
---
Content in classic would be fantastic
---
This is textbook modern wow players when classic launches, they will reroll every class to level 20 and then quit.
---
Some require a lot of luck
---
Some a lot of grinding
---
Some require both.
---
Prince Nazjak a 40 something elite spawn drops tidal charm at like 15% or something.
---
There is the arena trinket
---
Winterspring tiger is probably the longest grind in vanilla if you're doing things rationally. 
---
PvP mounts
---
Nothing else is gated like the AQ mount tho
---
Stamina was never a big concern for gearing a lock, no. Need dps stats just like now.
---
It means the current iteration of wow. Battle for azeroth expansion
---
The gear scaling would get out of control though
---
I get it seemed a little rude but honestly you could have answered your own question in less time it took to make your post by either just scrolling down this sub Reddit or googling like the other guy said. Everyone loves helping other people but when the answers right in front of your face people are like uhhhhhh. Hmmm.
---
By all over the place you, do you mean it runs in the same direction as the hunter (assuming flat ground), but not necessarily next to him/her? If so, I recall that specific behaviour very often back in original where my pet would be running noticeably far in front of me
---
Sure. Regardless they probably wont even approach that idea until a couple of years after release
---
/console maxCameraDistance 50
---
/console WeatherDensity 3
---
/console ffxglow 0 
---
These 3 whenever I start a new character/server. 
---
for ffx glow: (it is automatically set to 1, changing to 0 makes game easier on the eyes and textures are not colored so brightly. Could take away from classic experience tho, as it makes the color of the natural landscape look more like retail. Try it for yourself :))
---
I found the ventril soundboard part to be the funnier side of it
---
If you have to sold on rogue, you don’t deserve it.
---
Up to 40 yards if you wear the shamans best set, tier 1!
---
Loss of Escape Artist will hurt a bit vs melee (locks have very little mobility). 
---
WotF means engineering is going to be especially useful.
---
Human Lock isn't unplayable by any means. Undead Rogues will be a headache, but they are for any alliance warlock.
---
Mobs still "give xp". It just has to be a mob that gave xp before you were 60. No killing rabbits.
---
Have you used https://classicdb.ch/?
---
Incel memes
---
&gt;mage gets a very easy 6% hit from talents while lock get none, so locks have a very big mission getting +16% hit for raiding cap, and
---
Hit is important, capping it isn't necessary though. 1% hit really only equates to around +12 Spell Damage. If you're on top of your theorycrafting as a caster you'll be able to min max your DPS regardless of hit cap. You never want to go over 16% though.
---
Don't forget that quest is still super fun and entertaining!
---
TIL
---
Unclecreepy here. Cant wait to see you guys again on the 29th
---
My Warlock pets had AI. I was AFK in Un'Goro once, and came back to my Voidwalker having sacrificed himself because my HP fell below 30%, only to find a kitty druid attacking me.
---
Great tool. However, if you don't mind a recommendation. When you pop up the legend/reference, you should put it up in a corner so you can still interact with the map while it's on the screen. Would be a bit cumbersome to have to pop it open every time you forget what colors mean what.
---
As a warrior, these casters are so dangerous, especially the shamans ones, their lightning shield and their heal you can't interrupt!
---
You understand very quickly Classic is not a solo game!
---
it probably is I just was like meh on the video. I like the oxhord classics and such
---
Being in the top 1% (of those that meet the weekly Honor threshold) will only get you to rank 12. You need to be in the top 0.2% to reach rank 14. There were servers that were too small or didn't have enough PVP for any player to reach rank 14.
---
I usually don't respond to people like you because there is literally no point. I just felt like it might help to educate you a little because you clearly have some sort of agenda to dismiss my accomplishment on Mythic Argus. 
---
I did want to point out something neat between guilds like mine and Methods. The only difference between guilds like mine and Method is schedule. Being the 1% is based on WoWs population. We we're the 1% of the population who got cutting edge. We did down Mythic Argus pre-nerf as well. It took a lot of coordination. It was not easy. Did you down it pre Nerf or at all for that matter during progression?
---
Where my guild raided 9 hours a WEEK, 600 pulls on Argus was great progress, especially considering none of us do this for a living. Method raid almost twice as much PER DAY! 14 hours a day during progression. That is a fact. Go Google it.  If you do the math that's almost 100 hours a week vs our 9 hour schedule. Hope that brings some things in perspective for you. Have a good day
---
Me in the streets VS me in the sheets
---
We will see. 1.7 mil subscribers as of oct 2018, most likely less now.. even if it brings 300k people that's a 15% increase.
---
I think this could be true for more than just virgins.
---
“Who said I liked you?”
---
Ya this ain't no gift. Do they forget about "you think you do, but you don't". They practically fought their own fanbase over this, and they just recently gave beta invites to only people with active subs. They loot boxed a damn beta.
---
Most people don't even know rp-pvp servers won't be added, we need to be doing a better job spreading the word before August 13.
---
I sure fuckin hope not 😂
---
Really weird bug though, that’s for sure
---
Uhm ? I think the pictures should be the other way arround.....?
---
You tout the benefits of dw tanking and in the same breath say feral can't handle it. Go brush up on some game mechanics. I know you are just parroting information you've heard and don't actually know what you're talking about. Watch some skarm videos. You might learn a thing or two.
---
Is [this better](https://imgur.com/a/582wncw)?
---
Suffer together my brother!
---
I mean he goes on about how it was for server launches. I don't mind either of them. I'm coming off as a bit more of a dick here than I originally intended.
---
I'm really at a Crossroads
---
Getting around there without a mount sucked.
---
Quit being an ass
---
Can someone with beta access confirm this?
---
Yeh that was funnt just listened to it LOL
---
Actually breaking those eggs and fear bombing...
---
I remember I made a post a while ago saying that Classic is going to be phased on the same servers as BFA and people won't know it but there will be groups of level 120s standing right on top of them in IF and if someone flipped the phase switch, we'd see BFA/Classic right next to each other.  
---
Got put on blast for it, but your video makes things interesting.
---
The problem with this is that that's not all there is to flying. The reason I love flying is *not* because it makes getting my chores done easier, but because I like to just fly around and *look* at the game, and at the world they've built. I have spent hours and hours just flying aimlessly around Cata Azeroth, and I don't ever feel like I completely understand how any of the world maps fit together until I'm allowed to fly around them and check things out. This has probably been as important a part of the game to me over the years as any other part, if I'm being honest.
---
I remember it being pretty fast. I ran Vanilla with my girl at the time, I remember having to wait not very long after she looted a quest item when we were leveling together. Not instant, it sub-minute iirc.
---
FFXIV fucking sucks.  Played it since its dubious initial launch in 2010 because I thought it'd be like FFXI but better.  I was wrong  It's every bit as shallow as retail WoW (and virtually every other modern MMO), only with more repetitive combat and _really_ shitty PvP.
---
All three are good in PvP but hunter is god. Hunter, mage, then lock for gold farming. Mage is solid throughout in raid, lock good aq40+, hunter falls off after bwl, only need 2 or 3 hunters for raid so depending on pop may be hard finding a raid spot. All three are good levelers.
---
Full tuxedo set, white necklace, white rings, diamond tipped cane, I had it all!
---
This is pretty much me. I love PVP for the open battles that happen.   But IMO it just is not worth the trade off of being ganked anymore.
---
I doubt they'll give a shit about Classic.
---
that drakedog spec looks so fun.... as long as I have the proper gear that is
---
Hmmmm. I don’t know how much truth your theory holds. The cities, landscapes, and general world is very different from BfA to Classic. What about the people standing in the park district in stormwind, or to the east of Gadgetzhan?
---
But, I definitely think that all of the classic servers may have the opportunity / hardware for phasing, and that they occasionally may do so accidentally as Blizzard is still testing the hardware and servers.
---
Blizzard has mentioned they’ll be doing Layering in classic, but not phasing.
---
do rings actually show up on the model?
---
Ohhh snap! Then it was a bug for sure before. Darn it.. no grinding to 60 and enjoying the easy quest life afterwards then.
---
I never got to do these epic quests in vanilla, everything back then was so difficult!! I was only a wee lad..
---
Are there any professions I should be taking specifically as a Human Lock? Thanks for the insight.
---
Nah but you know someone inspected me and was like damn!
---
Yeah they never should have stopped making those tbh. They try to use books to tell the stories but it's not as immersive as something like a game guiding you down a story
---
Older content can still be kept relevant just like TBC did it - with attunements. There's also Legendaries that will keep MC and Naxx relevant until the end of the servers. And honestly speaking the jump from MC to Naxx is already wildly unbelievable.
---
Officers doesn’t matter unless you get serious about raiding. Just pick responsible helpful people if you’re a casual guild. Personality will be a solid binder, but the fact that you’re a tank is a solid thing to keep people together also. Tanks often times have an easy time making dungeon groups and that’s a good way to meet people. We are making a raiding guild, and for officers we have raid leaders, class leaders, loot council, Guild Master, banker, and economist (makes money for guild), and also plan to have people who do clerical work and things like checking who has raid consumables and making spreadsheets. You won’t have much labor if your casual, maybe recruitment and putting out fires with player conflicts, and someone who organizes grouping up for activities.
---
Flightpaths give that same feeling to me.  Arguably, exploring on the ground is far more enjoyable because you actually get to experience everything and feel like an explorer instead of just flying over it.  
---
Sucks if you enjoy flying just to look at the zones from above but overall it's shitty for the game and for the majority of players.
---
I’m the exact opposite, I looove those sunken ship/underwater cave quests. As a Druid I love using aquatic form to explore where a lot of other characters can’t. Just wish there was more stuff underwater to find!
---
Well I'm REALLY glad I saw this first before seeing that realmlist.
---
The right thing.
---
It seems it changed during this patch (the WSG one), to decaying. 
---
So it must've been a bug..
---
But, why should i care if the majority quit? I know the game won't ever die if it gets stale, so im fine. 
---
But i won't ignore your opinion, and if it was up to me, i'd put out TBC if there are enough people that want it, and there is no chance of the community being too split.
---
Its true that things are just opinions, but sometimes it's facts.
---
Blizzard inability to implement changes right, led us to BFA. But in the end it was the players who ultimately did this.
---
A guild bank?
---
I personally think Main Tanks make the absolute worst Guild Leaders. They can be fine Raid Leaders, just not Guild Leaders. Main Tanks have to be humble. An entire guild comes together to gear up a tank. They get showered in enchants and repair costs and consumables. Guild Leaders aren’t humble and they can’t be.
---
I think your best bet is to join a guild or a few, figure out what you like about their leadership styles, get some experience raiding, and then set off on your own.
---
Spread the word!
---
I used that saying during a lesson with 6 graders.. And one girl said "What if he had to walk over a large hill to school?", I was like, wtf it could actually be true!
---
Idk
---
I don't think a fresh server is the way to go.  It would split the community.  I think classic + new content is the best option.
---
take it back I cried at that vent video once i found it LOL ahhh uhhh  ehhhhh
---
Tfw you wake up and realise Blizzard aren't gods and are limited by the physics of our universe 😫
---
little dipper
---
Yeah blissard needs to double check that asap
---
Yes. We have to be way more vocal too. I'm not living through my guild dropping to 25m status again, slowly shrinking over time. I want azeroth not replacement new zone x craft.
---
A relatively pointless argument considering the alternative is jumping up 10 more levels and invalidating older gear anyways.
---
tailoring, there's an epic chest you can craft once you get the recipe from scholo. But it's not THAT big of a deal, although bloodvine from ZG once it releases is bis for a long while and you'll need tailoring to get the bonus from it
---
As much as I don't really like this song a whole lot, it's been stuck in my head for months. I just keep thinking about how bad I want to play classic and next thing I know I'm cooking dinner or showering and singing "I can't wait to log in, hop on a griffin"
---
USA omegalul
---
While what you say makes sense, this is also a PR move. Blizzard has done some very questionable decisions lately, and have lost a whole deal of respect from fans. The name Blizzard doesn't mean what it used to, back in the day.
---
So this is their chance to show that they "care" for their customers, and asking money for the game would only generate more diacontent for their business modela and ethics.
---
Of course this is just my opinion, it could be wrong, but it seems the most plausible explanation to me.
---
Yeah maybe if I roll an oalt  to trololol  but not on my main
---
THEY WERE BOYS!
---
This was changed during the time of vanilla.
---
Classic means having an awesome time with buddies. Retail is just not that.
---
Yesss I'm not sure if I'll be playing hunter or druid, but if I end up alliance night elf hunter with cat pet is very appealing for dank ambushes
---
Probably because BFA content takes a week to complete, Classic won't.
---
Same spec for pvp. Druids are not great at wpvp except against Rogues, mages and warriors.
---
Chonky boi in the back. Noic.
---
Free Level 40 Mount
---
Insane utility in dungeons and raids
---
Never summon people before they refer to you as Portal Daddy
---
In the same time Ion said that this is out of the question. Its 2 contradicting interviews in a short time.
---
People never once put out an interesting suggestion. They just proposed new content and never once tried to defend it when others showed the flaws.
---
Jesus if that's true it's about the next best thing you can get after someone who worked on Vanilla for Blizzard lol.
---
&gt;Until you realize that players begged for flying.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;They also begged for LFD to mitigate the fact that making dungeon groups manually was impossible when leveling through content from an irrelevant expansion at its original pace.
---
I think the Classic devs would be able to take a hard stance on things just like the OSRS devs do. They only introduce options that are in the spirit of the game, begging be damned 95% of the time. Players don't automatically get things polled when they ask.
---
That got removed in Beta patch 0.10
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_0.10
---
They disappeared in vanilla
---
Paladins in bgs are fine... Not ret tho. Useless
---
I can’t speak for some Alpha or Beta version of Vanilla before Nov 2004, but this was absolutely not in the original launch.
---
100% of players led us to BFA. 75% will lead us to constant drama and toxicity.
---
Damn incels with kids
---
Because the patch classic is running on is after the change was made?......
---
isnt everything on wowhead added in 1.13? i doubt thats accurate.
---
Don’t forget that significant chunks of Classic WoW, as well as smaller parts of BC and Wrath, and even Day of the Dragon were all building up Deathwing. This might sound blasphemous, but Cataclysm is something of a spiritual successor to Classic as far as narrative goes. Revisiting the old world, bringing back classic villains, and culminating with a battle with the villain who has been built up for roughly a decade. Given, Arthas had a similar treatment, but ending the story with him would have been all too abrupt for the Black Dragonflight arc.
---
As for afterwards, also don’t forget that by moving to new lore and stories cuts out two other major forces that were built up from WC3: The Legion, and the Old Gods. The Legion was defeated on Azeroth, but Kil’jaeden was still active and the now-noncanon RPG states that Azgalor survived the battle for Hyjal. With Kil’jaeden surviving the events of BC and Varimathras’ and Mal’Ganis’ roles in WotLK, it was clear then that the Legion was still as strong as ever.
---
The Old Gods have a similar deal. The WC3 manual stated that there were five Old Gods imprisoned on Azeroth (this was later retconned to four, but that’s neither here nor there). Even with C’thun and Yogg-Saron being defeated between Classic and Wrath, that still leaves three more. By the time of Wrath, we also knew that Cho’gall was still active and still very much insane, so that’s a whole ordeal on its own.
---
What I’m trying to get at is, there is a ton of lore left over from WC3, even with Arthas out of the picture. For Blizzard to either call it good there or to move on to new lore would be a disservice to all those characters and factions. Were they all handled well in Cata and beyond? Debatable. But, in a hypothetical post-Wrath WC4/WoW2, these lingering story arcs should still see the light of day.
---
I hope Esfand has his Beta access revoked. Blizzard has already said they gave the keys to streamers with explicit instructions not to sell them.
---
15y later I asked her about WoW and her very active son. Yesterday she just said, that she was jealous because she’s been alone from one day to another. But it was okay, because I grew up faster and learned some good life lessons. I was in tears, as I never understood why exactly she tried to get me away from this game and it was only because she wnted to be mor connected.
---
Okay the last scentence looks like Alabama xD
---
Is the patch this is running on before or after they changed it so priests couldnt Mind control the other team to talk to them?
---
I hope not. Hes just helping the community!
---
All ya had to say, friend.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Leave it to Tips to have no awareness and accept rez before even looking around first.
---
I mean, we have classic for a reason. Did you guys forget about the huge petitioning? Of course there are people who only want classic for classic. You'd be silly to deny. Vanilla still has potential to be a sleeping giant.
---
Nah, bit more than a week, mate. 
---
Instead of doing it all in one 6 hour session, they love to timegate it into six 1 hour long sessions to keep subs.
---
What server were you on?
---
Wtf is this? It's written in such a way that makes me irritated.
---
its just a circlejerk people who aren't subbed like to rub themselves raw over. Retail wow has fantastic endgame content in the form of raids and myth+, it's just everything *else* that's gotten lame asf.
---
You are ***not*** helping, converter-bot. God **damn you.**
---
They definitely do not
---
Helping the community would be doing what Blizzard says and giving the keys away. He’s not helping, he’s profiteering.
---
I know I'll get hate for this, but the slippery slope is a real thing.  It's present in almost every aspect of human activity.
---
You are fundamentally misunderstanding the slippery slope worry.  You mention in a different post, mockingly, "oh what's next, flying mounts?!".  That's not the worry.  Maybe what's next is taking away something small, like ammunition. Maybe it's slightly increasing the experience multiplier. Maybe it's adding something normally well received, like dual class.  Maybe it's tweaking a few other little things or adding a few QoL changes that "everyone wants".  What does that sound like? The slippery slope isn't always about quality of changes, it can be about quantity.
---
Nochanges is about being happy with what you have, knowing that if you ask for something different, the risk of it being better is not worth the risk of it being worse.
---
&gt; I don’t believe for a second that Blizzard devs and designers couldn’t maintain those pillars that he mentioned
---
I'm inclined to be trusting as well, but let me remind you that Blizzard has a bad track record with this as do many other modern gaming companies.  You can't blame people for not having faith when they've been disappointed 100 times.
---
I read that automatically in the correct actors voices
---
Hoping classic is some stop gap for a new MMO within the next 5 years.  Maybe some version of WoW 2?
---
WoW dominated the MMO genre for the last 15 years.  Love to see something new.
---
It is very, very possible that I am mis-remembering. But I thought dynamic respawns were one of the advertised features of burning crusade (and patch 2.x) and caused some overspawn issues in hellfire penninsula.
---
I remember waiting to have to kill stuff in vanilla, but I also don't remember waiting quite as long as I did like on the stress test in the starter zones.
---
I'm the one having fun tho!
---
You know he’s trolling, right?
---
#[NOT TOO SHAAAABBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dcZ9xnv8A8)
---
Your opinion seems pretty spot-on to me bud
---
This is so exciting to hear!
---
Gnomes also get that 5%int increase as well
---
Way better game than BFA
---
Non-instanced lvl 60 group focused content.
---
Raiding wasn't so mainstream like it is today - people probably just assumed this was the norm.
---
There were earlier reports of Esfand doing this as well, so much so that Blizzard responded on Twitter. I know this is likely a troll, but that doesn’t mean Esfand isn’t a piece of shit.
---
Engineer for every class then for lock your 2nd should be tailoring.
---
Another thread about additions and changes where no one agrees with anyone... good luck with keeping the "vanilla spirit" when blizz start implementing conent.
---
Add this, ad that...ad TBC without extra levels and flying...unbelievable.
---
I cant be trolling if I'm on the alliance. One of my conditions of the purchase was that I had to roll alliance.
---
Yes, okay. Thought it was release but must have been in the beta. Forgot I was in there I guess. Thanks for confirming I'm not crazy.
---
D:
---
Hiding in bushes etc used to be a legit strat in pvp. I remember standing in them in wsg and loading up a pyro + pom + pyro on unsuspecting flag carriers as they ran by.
---
Yeah I mistaken. Thought it was at launch but was in beta.
---
A+ title
---
Thrall's work.
---
This is obviously true, but in general people love rerolling.  I am very surprised more MMOs haven't picked up on this.
---
They can scale it down not everything has to go up :)
---
I don't know if it was around in vanilla but healbot im BC was retarded. It would auto cast a heal on whatever bar you clickef and it would choose the most optimal rank for that spell.
---
No problem, I only know about it myself because of [Madseasons videos on beta patches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ailbpMidMDU&amp;list=PL0hAOfdoZQkL6C0_lwHh741UbIbv2JGIm). He talks about it a fair bit
---
Dress for the g you want, not the c you have.
---
One of my favorite and most hated zones. Not a fan of deserts and it's just so brown (or white). But it's such an underrated gem for making shit loads of money.
---
Hey, having problems accessing this guide. When I click the link to the guide I get an imagine "Introduction on how to use this sheet"
---
What am I missing?
---
Yes, but they aren't going to do that long term. They want the server size to be rigid, as it was in vanilla.
---
Trust me, it's better to have the layering for a longer period of time than having too many servers and having them feel dead in the long term
---
How about other original vanilla stuff that's account bound?  
---
Original blizzcon murky pet is the one I'm wondering about.
---
They don't want to be using layering long term. So sure, it's probably technically feasible, but that's not something anyone would want.
---
Oh my god! I was just asking about the Helmet, this is amazing man... Thank you so much! I would ask for a fury one too but that's probably too much. Thank you again.
---
I sincerely hope not. Realm identity was a big part of Vanilla and competing with other realms for World Firsts was a part of that.
---
Layering isn’t separate realms. You can still group with everyone on every layer. Sure, your zone might not be crowded, but other things, like the AH, will be.
---
I honestly don’t know how Layering is going to work. Are we going to get different layers of cities where your WTS and WTB posts can only be seen by those in your layer? We already know the global zone chat channels are affected by layering.
---
Idk. I kinda want paladins to stay alliance only and shamans to stay horde. I don't want some of the changes that TBC brings. Horde paladins just never made sense from a lore perspective. Neither did alliance shamans. I like the way vanilla faction locked those classes. It gave each faction more of a distinct flavor.
---
Do they? I don't think they do. The difference it makes to put the player in the driver's seat is huge. Pre-Cata Azeroth had plenty of flightpaths (and there was a different, equally interesting effect of mystery when a flight path would fly you over Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes and preview this wasteland of ?? mobs before you actually got to go there; these are some of my coolest memories from being a total newb the first couple weeks of playing) but I still don't feel like I understood how everything is really laid out till I could fly. Or take a zone like Highmountain; do we feel like we *completely* understand it before we can fly around it self-directed? I don't think we do.
---
Flying is a trade-off. I'm not opposed to playing the game without flight for extended periods (including, obviously, all of Classic for however long it lasts). But there are very important but somewhat intangible benefits to flying and there's no way anyone can convince me that adding it was a completely bad thing for the game.
---
Going to second this. Obviously vanilla was a long time ago and strict memory is pretty bad for this sort of thing, but I remember most quest items respawning in less than half a minute.
---
I don't ever remember crazy lines for quest items like people are talking about, and having someone grab something from under your nose was annoying, sure, but not infuriating like a long respawn timer would be.
---
Low key I would buy a beta key
---
It's a tricky thing to manage. As soon as anything new is added to classic then the same call for the original experience will emerge again. I think that would necessarily rule out adding tbc to the vanilla servers for instance, and they would likely be fresh, separate servers if added.
---
I'd be happy to see additional content added to vanilla beyond naxx though. Lets be honest with ourselves, the vanilla naxx content itself will be like additional content for the vast majority of vanilla players because it was released too close to tbc to have been experienced by most. Things like additional quests, additional dungeons/raids, maybe even additional zones, would be fine (in my opinion anyway) as long as they don't introduce power creep or a mandatory aspect, rendering the base game obsolete.
---
Do you want a cookie or upvote or something ? Like the millionth time I’ve seen a pic of someone’s strat guide and half their computer. Your not unique and your not more prepared
---
Thanks. I'll watch that tonight at work while I wait for the hours to go by and I can get back to beta.
---
Low key go buy one from esfand :)
---
What about raids that don’t offer gear, but some other rewards? Mounts, or whatever. That way old content doesn’t become obsolete. But some other tangible reward would be cool too.
---
Even if you shapeshift as a druid, you retain your original hitbox.
---
The worst part about the changes was the questing. The linear, over-saturated, cataclysm questing experience that guides you start to finish through each zone was just terrible. We leveled so fast that we outlevel the zone before we even finish 50% of the quests. They didn't let the zones tell the story anymore.
---
PvE. I was on Mannoroth back in the day and will not miss being ganked.
---
I always got that "woahhhh look at that shit" feeling from taking certain flightpaths for the first few times and noticing shit along the way.  Nonetheless, I don't like the idea of being able to fly because it makes the world feel smaller and kills wPvP.    
---
The "intangible benefits to flying" are very selfish and instant-gratification centered.  We already saw what flying did to the game.  It was a net negative overall.
---
I told him to message me so the ball is in his court if he wants to make some money
---
You're over-thinking it.
---
You have a tank. You have heals.
---
Go have fun. Enjoy.
---
Can confirm it does not work in a vanilla client.
---
Feral druids are very good tanks for dungeons and can be offtanks in raids, restro druids can heal dungeons however in raids you want a limited numbre of them, leveling together will be possible, however both of you gota realize that as a druid you have to and want to make use of your entire kit, you wont sit in tauren form 100% of the time, or bear form 100% of the time.  But its definitely possible and should be quite fun for the two of yall.
---
All just fun thoughts. People who take it too seriously will be here soon to tell me how much of a worthless piece of shit I am.
---
Huh. Clearly my memory is failing me. But there it is, gnomes was the size of small islands!
---
&gt; Older content can still be kept relevant just like TBC did it - with attunements.
---
This created a toxic environment in TBC where serious raiding guilds could only fill attrition by poaching laterally, which led to **guild-killing** as a progression mechanic. Couldn't poach? You burned out your tanks and healers by making them pound Heroic Shattered Halls for recruits/alts. This was before LFG, so tanks and healers had no incentive to waste their time.
---
**Attunements for past content is a band-aid—not a solution.**
---
&gt; Legendaries that will keep MC and Naxx relevant until the end of the servers.
---
Ultra-rare drops for a multi-year meta-achievement, like Legendaries, is cool, but you can't reasonably gear an entire guild with these Legendaries. **The raids are still effectively irrelevant in the context of future added content.**
---
We all knew 8t was a gag when it was made.
---
Thoughts and prayers :(
---
I don't really care if the community comes to a 100% conclusion about something. Even if they do, I still don't think WoW should do it.
---
Game designers and players are essentially opposing forces.
---
TBH I'm not very clued into the realm identity of the past. Only know from playing retail that certain server's general playerbase is good/bad/lots of pvpers. Just really curious why realm identity is important.
---
Wouldn't it be better for everyone who has a certain playstyle to just exist in one server like EVE Online(different MMo I know), rather than split off into multiple server since we now have the technology, sorta?
---
Sorry, but a forum post from a Community Manager hold less weight than the statement of original WoW developers or team members.
---
Yeah!
---
Starcraft 2 isnt a competitive game and no one watches it. I have never in my entire life met someone who watches starcraft 2 seriously, and I lived in fucking Korea for years
---
In brood war reaction speed and micro play is everything, rock beats paper if your micro is good enough rock beats literally everything if your micro is good enough. 
---
You think league isn't about reaction speed? Whats your rank? I'm diamond 1 what are you?
---
I remember. I just stealth around the opposite faction. They get complacent if you’re patient enough. I spend a lot of time in stealth.
---
That isn't always a catch-all. You can have unlimited server power and still have bottlenecks, happens all the time. That being said, WoW is so battle-tested that I would amazed if Classic presented any new problems.
---
3 FPS?
---
I got my printed frames via mail.
---
Why not? They get complacent faster than you think.
---
I only know this guy for 2 things: 
---
1) getting his thorium node stolen by a dying dwarf. 
---
2) getting tricked by hunter's fd and almost dying
---
The list just grew
---
here's a clip of something similar happening but it is a beta player seeing an alpha player https://www.twitch.tv/moo_uk/clip/NeighborlyOriginalPeachANELE
---
&gt; I don’t believe for a second that Blizzard devs and designers couldn’t maintain those pillars that he mentioned.
---
I don't see how you can maintain that belief in the face of D3, SC2, Overwatch, Hearthstone, HotS and all of the WoW expansions. I'm not ruling it out as a possibility, but the developers and culture of Blizz seem to be almost diametrically opposed to the creation of content and decisions based on the pillars of Vanilla wow (and early 2000s Blizz) design.
---
I'm playing so that I can play vanilla, not give Blizzard a redo to try to implement tbc/wrath/etc content in a 'classic' fashion. If they want to try that I hope they keep the option to play actual classic forever. Would much rather experience fresh starts every 1-2.5 years then watch them fuck everything up again in new ways.
---
You keep being you, bro.
---
Blizzard uses AWS? I always assumed they had their own datacenters.
---
I am glad I don't worry about this kind of stuff :)
---
I wonder what his shovel does.
---
yeah yeah yeah, that's bullshit
---
If you want to get a spot in a good guild early, and its very important to join a good guild in vanilla. If you want a spot in a guild, you need to level up fast... if you take your time you're gonna end up in a slow progressing guild and you will never get anywhere.
---
I always wished I had a better buff than unending breath. I hope just once they were on their way to an underwater quest and it helped.
---
The trouble is that the sky is just way too big. The chance of even finding someone in the air is small.
---
But there are certain things that the community could be 100% right on and should affect WoW's development.  
---
We already experienced all of the bad stuff in WoW and we can now look back on it and decide "hey that was bad for WoW, lets look at why."  
---
Example:  Flying mounts being the most obvious.  It was purely trash for the game.  It killed wPVP.  It made the world feel small.  It gave zero reason to interact on the ground, you could literally just skip over everything.  It made zones feel like glorified nothingness.  It made ground mounts obsolete.  It made the game feel like "fly up, fly to point, do stupid shit that doesn't matter, fly up, repeat".  You might as well just allow players to teleport everywhere, it would have the same effect.
---
Weird! Blizzard probably needs to fix this soon
---
Nah I prefer a museum piece.
---
Good times of being an Undead Rogue and diving into water when someone tried to gank and watch them drown trying to reach me. 
---
Drowning people in the river in AB was always a good time for over-commited players.
---
Volume 4 is the best one he made!
---
No, it wouldn't be better. Server identity was such a huge part of Vanilla WoW. You didn't just know things like "wow this server is mainly alliance" like you do now. You knew 10-20 of the top PvPers because they had rank 13/14 and would stand in IF/ORG to show it off. You knew the best guilds without having to check online simply because players in that guild actually had gear you could visually recognize as being amazing. You knew the ninja looters, the guys who gave enchants away, different people for every profession that would help you. So server identity isn't so much as what other people think about your server, it's about the community and stories that get told within the server.
---
That is true, this is a decision for Ion and Blizzard management to make. Us players can only tag along for the ride.
---
Actually really enjoyed it
---
Thanks!  I was kinda thinking the same thing, but I figured "what better place to get some detailed answers to a specific question that reddit!"  
---
Yea, my goal is to ultimately have fun.  I do like to geek out on details from time to time though, lol.  
---
Thanks again!
---
Lol you are LITERALLY talking shit about the entire community who played vanilla in an attempt to sound superior? because you played on an 2 bit copy of the real thing?
---
Lol you are a stupid person.
---
my wife, her boyfriend, and myself are going to be leveling together and the advice I got was pretty much any tank/healer/dps would be fine
---
I'm planning on playing paladin on a pve server.
---
Which was a necessity at that level. Nobody was gonna slog through a difficult leveling experience from 1-80 just to finally get to start cata. Especially new players in a world where the vast majority are at max level. 
---
People asked for it to help new players and to assist in alts.
---
I don’t give a fuck about your bad opinion.
---
Makes sense. If people pretend they remember what the spawn rates were at all times for mobs out in the world from 14 years ago. Just know they are full of shit.
---
I can't remember the last time I got lost questing in a zone and just enjoyed it and absorbed it, (even these days, it feels like most quests are completed in about 1 minute or 2..( I never thought I'd miss it, but I really do, and I can't wait to get back.  For some reason I always thought places like  [Swamp of Sorrows](https://youtu.be/s14G2JdLh6Y?t=3s), Un'Goro Crater, and Burning Steppes were incredibly mysterious, you don't get many hints, you just have to search, and you're often rewarded for it!
---
Fellow Mannorothian! I played on Mannoroth through most of BC, and ended up moving over to a PvE server near the end of it. Man, was it liberating.
---
While the Vanilla experience is great.  People forget we wanted all the features they have now.
---
40 man raids with only 2 pieces of loot dropping.  People disappointed their hard raid time was spent on a 4th set of judgement shoulders with nobody needing them.  Essentially raiding for a chance to upgrade gear, not just yours but anyone in the guilds.  That’s why tokens came out.
---
Running endlessly, and the time spent on just travel.  Getting a flying mount was an iconic moment in my wow life.  Sure the nostalgia will be there, but play Vanilla for 3 years and see if you don’t want to fucking fly.
---
Class homogenization across the board.  Sounds great until you realize your class has 2 useless specs with unsupported gear.  Or getting roflstomped in PVP because you don’t have the CC or burst damage to 1v1 most people.
---
Costly respec/dual spec; try new solo content as a holy priest or resto Druid.  Watch as people complete a quest while you are Farming the first mob.
---
I’m excited for Vanilla, but people forget how tedious it all was.
---
I mean without layering you'd *still* have had login ques for the server
---
Idgaf abt your bad opinion.
---
All objects on the beta up to level 30 have near instant respawn.

Just curious, some redditor has mentioned realm identity, like u/UbiGeofram , can you tell me why its important? because my experience with the whole realm identity from retail is that some server's players are good/bad players. 
---
Wouldn't it be better for everyone to just be under one roof(of the same playstyle)?
---
&gt;The "intangible benefits to flying" are very selfish and instant-gratification centered.
---
That's nonsense. I'm not talking about *any* "gratification," or any sort of reward at all, really. Getting a daily done quicker, or getting to a gathering node more efficiently, or being able to avoid a fight when its convenient to you, these are *tangible* benefits of flying, and they are not what I'm talking about.
---
&gt;We already saw what flying did to the game. It was a net negative overall.
---
We'll have to agree to disagree. I think its a complicated trade-off. I does do most of what you say it does, I'll give you that.
---
&gt; Layering is still very much a work in process, but the sooner Blizzard realizes its shit and removes it the better Classic launch will be.
---
Listen, I want the game to be a museum piece too.  I want classic as it was to exist for as long as possible, but I'm not oblivious to the fact that we will eventually exhaust all of the content and it'll get boring.   Because it definitely could.  That's why possibly adding content post naxx would be amazing instead of going into expansions, because expansions split the community and bring in new things that could potentially make the game worse and just bring us closer to retail which is what we don't want.
---
There is no single boss that will make a good guild wipe more than 20 times.
---
In my experience on live vanilla and pservers, warlocks seems to be harder to find, as mages are a dime a dozen which makes you more sought after, if that's important to you.  Your dps will be very good, and will be a monster in wpvp and bgs.
---
And over 200 guild masters! The right guild is waiting for pretty much everyone here already :)
---
Like in vanilla I'm going to start out PvE but I know deep down I'm gonna spend countless hours in WSG again. That's MY flag you filthy Ally, and you CAN NOT have it!
---
So just roll horde, i'm not seeing the problem.
---
Blizzard. Is. Not. Making. A. Private. Server.
---
Esfand called out. Give this man his key!
---
That's because there is no way to defend it. I don't want new content in Classic from modern Blizz and anyone with common sense feels the same way.
---
Clip unrelated?
---
I would like to see TBC and Wrath added with no class changes, just the content.
---
This dude, pretending like he isn't attracted to troll women.
---
Hey so I looked for this video and I can't seem to find it. Do you have a link? Thx
---
Awesome lol.
---
You will get hit as elemental shaman, thats why virtually everybody runs around with MH + shield and as much mail gear as you can get with caster stats. 
---
However I agree that Eye of the Storm will not be as strong as on pservers, therefore I 100% go 5/5 Healing Focus to maintain your strong heals.
---
It's not nonsense.  Flying is literally "I want to go here, so I'm just going to fly there and avoid all of the ground content and pvp potential because I want to."  
---
Literally the definition of selfish, self centered, and instant gratification.   
---
&gt;Getting a daily done quicker  
---
selfish, self centered, faster gratification  
---
&gt; getting to a gathering node more efficiently   
---
selfish, self centered, faster gratification, also avoiding potential PvP and/or random mob/random people encounters.  
---
&gt; or being able to avoid a fight when its convenient to you 
---
So literally always?  Because that's what happened.  Everyone just avoided fighting because it was convenient.
---
You had ONE job Payo
---
Or if you know of some place I can find this information myself that would be a big help too!
---
as long as u funnel her bf gear while lvling you'll be fine.
---
he'll be playing warrior I'm assuming
---
I mean, goodluck? You can always just not tell them.

iirc they'd just turn around or keep hitting you.
---
You're in a guild with them, thus on the same later. 
---
What's stopping Billybob from neckbearding to 60 on a nearly empty server to camp lotus spawns, waiting for a merger because there wasn't any layering?
---
Whats stopping Jimbo from playing 16 hours a day everyday for 6 months? How can you compete with him?
---
Generally no, but I think you’re also severely underestimating what “no-life” entails here with regard to progression raiding.
---
This list is a good argument for why I don't want any changes.
---
Some accept it, there’s several pserver guilds that allow it atleast. It wasnt as common back in the day afaik though.
---
out of the loop on this meme.

Shaman is a great healer. That can spec into hybrid heals/dps. Plus you get the added bonus of utility and both get travel form at 20.
---
&gt;  and they just recently gave beta invites to only people with active subs.
---
...Why wouldn't they? Betas have always been restricted with the sole exception of the original stress test before the classic launch cause, you know, the game wasn't out yet. This of all things is really an indicator they're "all in it for the money?"
---
Just one question what the hell would be the point of retiring a character.
---
hilarious considering this
---
&gt; On level up, the message: “Your skill in Protection increased to 15” was added in 1.12.1, and we’re intending to keep that.
---
That's probably what I'm gonna do. Anything you say will be used against you.
---
Armor Dye! 
---
I mean transmog is bad because it doesn’t represent what you’re wearing but being able to recolor your pink AQ boots to match your set (or match your set to your pink boots) would be a nice incentive to make people raid without breaking the game (boss would drop a color reageant that alchemist could use for a dye potion)
---
If they are not conflicting and not impacting each other then i don't see a problem, remember though that you will be farming a lot for raids, you might run into the problem where you spend all the time preparing for one characters raid and not have any time or stuff left to  give the other character.

You need to find an insensitive for ppl to keep running the instance take molten core or zg for example things like thunderfury petrified leaf and prist staff in mc and shoulder enchant in zg made ppl that out geared the instance still want to do them. This is really hard to do if you don't offer item upgrades. If for example the reward was a mount what is the reason for me to farm raid consumables and show up for raid once I have it?

Especially when half the servers die and people bitch about how classic is dead because they weren't lucky. Then blizz has to offer transfers or merge servers like modern wow.
---
Yeh, like most GM's would want you to be farming gear, mats, consumables, whatever for your character thats in their guild.
---
Fuck the portal
---
Do you want que times and dead servers or do you want layering?
---
Definitely not - I ranked to 12 in vanilla as a rogue. You could vanish which would drop the flag and immediately repick the flag.
---
Shouldn't be a problem. But why ask here? Ask your 2 guilds, explain it and make sure they're fine with your decision. That's not a question for this sub.
---
Everything will be in its final 1.12 state.
---
Ok
---
Yeah man then we have half of the servers die off and get merged.
---
I wish Classic had 0 days to go. :(
---
With regard to TBC, are you saying no horde Paladin/Alliance Shaman? That is an interesting take if so.
---
I mean, how the racial is in 1.12 is how the racial will be, if they end up doing progressive servers they probably will let you copy ur character over from 1 server to the progressive server which those servers would end up changing ur racials if that patch had changed it.
---
Hey that's n-oh, wait you said good guild. Alright, true.
---
That makes a lot of sense actually.  Though, I was never sure because Tauren would be able to attack farther away in cat, etc.  Would love to see someone test it in the Beta to see if it's working right.
---
No you're not.
---
Yes, no changes to classes or abilities.
---
Classic means Classic. Not Remastered Classic. Accept it
---
I'm happy you have confidence, let's take the global warming approach and prep for the worst though. I'd rather not get to 60 only to have my server die.
---
How would you progress the class trees?
---
I love that episode of pure pwnage. "You want some shadow word pain, take some shadow word pain!" "I got level 60 in like 2 days" "He said he didn't need to eat because his spirit was so high" my favorite quotes, that hopefully i remembered correctly
---
Thank you for the excellent explanation, I really appreciate your point of view as I have a different one.
---
I started playing vanilla just before TBC launch and didn't play consistently again until Legion. I'll most likely play Classic as I wanna experience the Warlock mount and demon quests again. Obtaining those are still my fondest memories. Unfortunately I'm not big into finding wow friends/guild back in the days, so I only remember the "game" part of WoW as being excellent, and no attachment to other players.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is I play WoW as a game, I want to be in the "World" of Warcraft, other players existing in the game world is just doodads/distraction for me, no offense :P Different strokes for different folks I guess.
---
I think it's good that Blizzard have Classic WoW and retail WoW, so different individuals with different goals can experience what they want.
---
QoL changes are very small changes to make the game less annoying with no or little impact on the gameplay, they have nothing to do with instant gratification.
---
Flying mounts are a big change that were a huge feature of an expansion. The were not a QoL change and definitely not the "first" QoL change, as nearly every patch in vanilla had a few QoL changes.
---
The very first patch (1.2) after the 1.1 release had many QoL changes, so the first QoL change would be one of those, e.g.:
---
&gt; There is now a short countdown before a duel starts.
---
&gt; When a player breaks the surface of the water going up (i.e. heading out of the water), the camera will move to the above-water position regardless of whether or not the player is holding down the right mouse button.
---
&gt; The Minimap arrows that point to locations/players/etc. are now easier to see.
---
&gt; Macros that cast spells will show spell feedback (e.g. cooldowns, etc.) on the action bar.
---
source?
---
Woah, I had no idea they already released the alpha. Did they announce that? Or is that usually kept under wraps?
---
That's neat.
---
First of all, Mages are a top tier DPS spec in raiding and Warriors can DPS or tank. Hunters and Warlocks are certainly viable in raids and in some cases bring very important utility. 
---
It kinda reminds me of retail WoW where people obsess over damage meters but a lot of the early raid content is simply not that demanding and I don't see any reason why you couldn't have at least a few of any DPS spec and clear content as long as you have a stable amount of people playing the best ones as well. Now that's not to say that some DPS classes won't struggle because they will, the DPS specs are not balanced in vanilla. 
---
Every class in this game has a niche or role in raiding, but particularly in any other content. You can play any spec while leveling, though some are certainly better than others, and you can play about any spec doing dungeons or PVP.
---
No point. It's optional for leveling enthusiasts.
---
It's not vanilla without gold farmers spelling out the name of their gold selling website in dead level one orcs in Orgrimmar
---
I dont have much knowledge in this but couldnt the mangos devs just fucked up like the they did with a plethora of other things? Therefore wrong gnome models just flew past for the longest time like Sweeping Strikes consuming too many stacks in one attack for years and years until it was patched in 2017/18.
---
Points would still be given. I meant more balancing wise.
---
Did you not read the title?
---
And they can just make a new character, I'm not understanding the -5%.
---
Haha, yes!! Mine was a tauren with a tuxedo. :)
---
I agree with everything you are saying, but you should come to grips with the fact that most people don't have the capacity to understand your argument. If they did, they would also be #NoChanges. I would not waste time and heartache debating lost causes. Once Blizzard and their band of fools ruin the game again, we can just make pservers again using the data from Classic.
---
Nerfs/buffs etc.
---
Was not expecting this level of serious salty downvotes. My complaint was they advertised as being a summer release. The end of august is not a summer release even for those who arent educators its just fact. Depending upon where you live the summer season is well over by this date, I have no problem with this release, but I wish they had either been more honest or kept us in the dark.
---
I'll believe it when I see it...
---
there already is one
---
How would that effect you if they join em as soon as they dip? This solution is better for players and more costly for blizz, and that's the reason we won't get it.
---
You're disagreeing with me that flying was a net negative for the game.  I gave you objectively factual reasons why it was.  You can disagree subjectively, because you like flying, but you can't ignore the facts.
---
If you want the hard life! There's a lot of games that after playthrough, enable some form of hardmode.
---
Yes the announced it, and it was just blizz employees and friends and family
---
Sonic Syndicate, that's some nostalgia.
---
This is prob why I'm actually gonna roll Alliance this time around. Feels kinda wrong, but fuck it.
---
For the Alliance (I guess!).
---
The main problem i see with this was the fundamental shift in the PvP meta. It would be hard to keep the Vanilla trees and make them viable with the direction that TBC went.
---
More servers and no layering please.
---
Alpha comes before beta mate. This is probably a friends and family alpha player
---
Very cool.
---
So why do they go out of their way and implement clunky spell batching and ridiculous tauren melee ranges then?
---
Not trying to bash Quin her but he clearly still has the retail WoW mentality of PVP where he can bubble offensively and attempt to one shot the enemy.
---
Ultimately any added content will negatively impact the original game because the original game was not balanced nor was is designed with any of these things in mind. None of these ideas could be effectively implemented without completely redesigning 1-60 all over again and taking them into account.
---
Add one new item to one part of the game and you've just destroyed the carefully designed flow of power a class has to go through. Adding another profession might sound fun, but you're essentially destroying the incentive to run many dungeons because their drops are suddenly deprecated.
---
&gt; Add more leveling zones for levels 40-59.
---
Part of the charm of Vanilla is that there actually aren't *that* many zones to play through. Adding more zones would dilute the population across more and more areas, reducing the possibility of interactions between players. This is something YBC massively fucked up on, by forcing everyone to live on a disconnected world.
---
&gt; At 60, you can retire your character.
---
This is the only idea I think has some merit. It could be interesting to play around with the idea that the farther your level 60 has progressed, the faster you can level an alt to 60 again (cutting the time down from a few days to maybe a day?) 
---
This would solve a lot of problems that hardcore players have always had with trying other classes in Vanilla. It would also be incredibly rare since you'd have to effectively delete one of your characters.
---
It also has no real impact on the design of the world, so that could fly.
---
I hate when people make this argument. I hate to break it to you, but even testing in a professional environment (I did it for many, many years) consists primarily of playing the game and just seeing what breaks as you go through your usual rounds. Challenging each other to weird competitions of speed or feats are among the easiest ways to find issues with the games in scenarios that are likely to actually impact customers down the road. Sure we did boring shit like jumping off every rock but that is hardly a true representation of what we normally did. 
---
Listening to people whine on random forums about how gnomes are "obviously the wrong size" and that I or anyone else has a duty to hunt down this obscure issue doesn't really inspire me to locate 14 year old gnome footage and compare it myself. I mean I really don't care about this issue at all.
---
Are alphas usually given out to family members/friends? I've gotta talk to my brother in-law more.. 
---
Thanks guys.
---
god bless. creators of the world. of warcraft.
---
I am not hardline #nochanges. But I hate almost every suggestion you made. I'd be interested in more mid or late game levelling content, and generally seeing the various "obviously incomplete" bits of the game turned into actual content.
---
Stuff like Azshara Crater, Mount Hyjal, Karazhan, Uldum, and the ruins of Silvermoon. There were a bunch of dead end questlines and random instance portals and empty zones and pointless NPCs throughout the world, let's see what could be done with them under a Classic design philosophy.
---
No because then there's really not much community of the server.  
---
If you got a realm with let's say 100k players logged on then if I group up and quest with a player, I'll likely never encounter this player again since the server has 100k people online.  It's the same issue with retail where if you see someone in the world but there's no reason to interact with them since you know you will likely never see them again.  In retail players don't interact because everyone is essentially anonymous.
---
I honestly believe gear resets is a good way to go. It is almost an must. If we did not have it almost only the ppl playing from the very beginning would se any new content. The % of players that gets to do/see new newly introduced instances decrease every time you introduce a new one. Whit a reset like tbc/wotlk  new players and players that previously did not have the time/or chance to experience late game content a new chance in the new expansion
---
Even with being able to max out 2 trees at 80?
---
It might cause difficulties when zg/aq20 gets released.
---
Also if your guild contests world bosses.
---
I wouldnt recommend it.
---
EHHHOHHHH
---
tranquil air totem is rare in a group tho. if you are the warlock in a tank group(with improved imp, wich you will most likely be with this build) then tranquil air cant be put down.
---
if you are in any other group, i doubt they will put down tranquil air if everyone else benefits from windfury/spelldmg totem
---
it's rare to see tranquil air in vanilla..
---
&gt; When was the last time you made a friend from, if ever, in lfg or lfr?
---
All the time for M+. If you run with people who are good you add them to play together another time. And if you pug raids through LFR you get to know people REAL quick. I started BFA in an IRL friends guild that was semi-casual and kinda breaking apart so I had to pug AOTC week 1 and I got to know a lot of people through LFR that I kept playing with for weeks after.
---
The real issue with the other parts of LFG is that grouping isn't necessary, and when it is it's just a big zergfest that you nuke down in a pile of players in 20 seconds (this is also mostly a sharding issue making it easy to just join a 40man gangbang squad  instantly for a WQ boss because of millions of players being in the same server technically).
---
LFG/LFR would be totally fine in classic IMO because the content requires you to use it in a way beyond just jumping in a party for 1 easy aoe spam and drop group. You actually need to communicate and stick around longer.
---
Yeah I think it should be always maintain vanilla, but also release a "classic" version of the next expansion, with the ability to "copy" your character into the next expansion so you can continue to play your guy on vanilla, but also progress further if you want to do that.
---
"opinions that agree with my own ONLY itt"
---
Not walls, no.
---
Honestly, I don't know much about the PvP side of it.
---
I love the bit where &gt;!you go nuts with the camera spinning and in the next scene you're just on fire!&lt; :D 
---
Classic video for classic wow
---
Blizzard has been right on everything they have pulled from their 1.12 client. EVERY... SINGLE....TIME. We always dig out proof and it backs them up. And we found proof they were right on this issue too: on this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bslxiz/gnomes_are_the_correct_height/eop4z5o/
---
**This questioning that Blizzards reference client with the original code they wrote 16 years ago needs to stop.** Its needlessly conspiracy theory tier, and it always ends up the same way. Its embarrassing how it always ends up being right and the problem is with Private Server data too..
---
Idk I definitely see you point but that type of blanket generalization can be the reason you miss that super cool GM / MT who manages his guild amazingly and is still humble and a great tank
---
While rare, they exist, so don't miss one cuz you think they are unicorns!
---
So..my first and only main character I started in classic and still have to this day is a lock. I don’t think I could enjoy another class as much.
---
So, for a lock:
---
1. You get a pet that has different abilities. Voidwalker taunts and tanks, felhunter interrupts spells and “eats” buffs, and succubus charms and does great dos. They can also be sacrificed for additional benefits.
---
2. A very dynamic rotation. First, you can pull several mobs at once, cast a curse and insta cast corruption on all of them, fear one or two away,  focus on one using a wand or shadow bolt, then finish with drain soul for a soul shard. If you find your mama low, you cast life tap to sacrifice life for mana, but then you can use drain life or eat a hearthstone that you conjured to get life right back up. A good lock rarely has mana problems and should rarely stay at full health. 
---
3. There are different builds of course. While destro is probably the highest burst damage, I never liked it. I like the survivability of affliction. But that’s the beauty of classic. Being able to grab a talent from a separate tree than your focus to help you out with shortcomings. 
---
Overall, with having a pretty good number of spells, having to control a pet and use the sacrifice ability when needed, ability to conjure hearthstones, ability to tap life for mana, ability to do high continuous damage, and have several cc abilities like fear, mortal coil, and howl of terror...there’s not even a competition for what to play for me. If you choose a good race (I prefer undead for the cc break “will of the forsaken” and “devour corpse” that allows eating corpse for health, the survivability is off the charts, but it’s not easy by any means. You will ALWAYS be doing something and your keybindings are very important.
---
I hope you have a great time playing in classic. It’s such a difference that it’s impossible to explain. 
---
With a warlock older than some people who play the game, I can say this is the most boring time I’ve ever had playing him. The rotation is fixed and predictable. Most talents are either useless, nerfed to hell and back, and only a couple spells are actually used. I play a demo lock now just for the challenge, and even it’s fairly mundane. Nothing like having to navigate pet control, casting, and health/mana management all at once.
---
What? You can get into the BfA PTR without a sub. Most of the people interested in vanilla don't have subs.
---
Oh yeah. I forgot it want 280 right away.
---
60% and leaving it there makes sense. I remember 60% barely being better and literally riding sometimes because it felt the same.
---
Add an /s, some would take this seriously
---
By the gods!
---
Thank you! Didn't know about this. Is it as up to date as wowhead though?
---
for blizzard normally yeah
---
25 man raids was a in my mind a very smart decision. It allows for every player to be more impactful and for the development team to make more intricate and involved fights.
---
Thank you so much! I appreciate it a lot.
---
Oh my fucking god get over yourselves I swear the WoW community whines more about streamers than any other. It's like listening a bunch of adult babies whine that someone is more popular and makes more money than them.
---
I was a 90's teenager and all these kids are stealing my culture. literally shaking rn
---
Use Google?
---
I’m focusing more on 70. Specs that were popular at 60 were wholly unusable at 70. I was a Vanilla HWL &amp; TBC R1 and play styles and specs for many classes had to be completely changed for viability. For example, elemental spec mage (frost/fire control) was very popular in Vanilla and completely inadequate in TBC. Things like cyclone made Druid viable in the death match style that arena introduced. Things like priest pain suppression were also added to balance out class inadequacies, but that came at the end of arena S2.
---
Unfortunately we don’t have any other vanilla sources.
---
There was a question asked to blizzard if they would make more content after naxx. They said they were open to the idea  as long as classic does well. Its very likely we will see more content.
---
Nope I switched Alliance for BfA. Tried to work a few times on my Horde druid but I didn't really care for the troll-themed zones.
---
At least if I DO get around to it I have aquatic form (still bothers me to go in the water, haha)
---
YOU HAD ONE JOB!
---
On a popular pserver a neckbeard guild got their bank alt scarab lord...
---
My soul shards stay in my bags overnight. Maybe they disappear over a long period of time?
---
Yup. Hope you enjoy it.
---
Let's give it until the end of summer to see if the trend holds. I assume it'll level out at about half the interest of that spike.
---
Let's hope he will because we need high numbers to keep this game
---
No he said the streamer reported it missing
---
This is why we have an electoral college and not a popular vote.
---
Believe it or not, people are dumb.
---
he's actually a really nice guy, bought me a switch and everything
---
I just double check in options, also in the code. For World of Warcraft directory it ask for Wow.exe what is an executable with case sensitive for Battle for Azeroth. For Classic Beta it asks for WowB.exe what is binary file for classic beta, and everything is detected as intended. You are saying that u are trying to attach folder where is wow.exe file and you do complain about Case sensitive, looks like you are using an old version of the client, and you also mention version 1.12 what sounds that you are using wow vanilla client to connect on pserver? If u have client that u use to play on private servers, then sorry we are not going to implement code for such checking.
---
Ok, you got me. I retract my statement.
---
Honestly, if they just added the races to existing starting zones I could live with that. And it would be a lot  easier to implement. Drae start with nelves, Gilnaes get to pick between nelves and humans, belfs start with the forsaken, goblins pick between durotar and tirisfal. 
---
Don't see them doing that and I'm pretty sure they're not going to create new content (TBC and wrath servers probably though), but it's fun to speculate
---
He doesn’t have nameplates activated in the clip, though?
---
Not what I asked. I'm just confused about this relationship.
---
Would be nice to see all of those used somehow in classic. did you ever do the raid "Battle for mt hyjal"? Was one of the best ones in BC
---
No worries. My wife sure as hell won't let me forget my responsibilities
---
I may be older but I didn't think I was that old.
---
Private servera
---
I had a lot of fun playing duo as Hunter and druid. They have the speed boosts, pvp survivability, and a druid has the flexibility for group activities. The worst thing is competing for gear.
---
But the best advice I can give you is to play the class you want to play the most because there's a good chance you won't be duo leveling 100% of the time. What's the point of playing if you guys aren't enjoying yourself?
---
Eh, I like the class changes in wrath in particular. I loved tankadin in that expansion and for the first time ever I enjoyed a healing class (disc priest)
---
I loved vanilla wow but it did have a problem with a lack of viable endgame tank classes
---
What is orgrimmar's 2nd back door? Pretty sure there's only one in classic.
---
My nogga
---
I see. Have never played horde in vanilla, not exactly sure how totems worked. Also for imp imp I didnt even think guilds bothered with different spec. My guild would just use SM/ruin in tank group.
---
Nope
---
Where do you guys find this stuff out? Interesting!
---
Beautiful meme
---
I kinda thought with the added points to 80 more specs would become viable.
---
Gear resets are really bad for keeping players interested in grinding WoW, and keeping people wanting to raid because you always know your gear is going to be made obsolete a few months from now when they release a new raid with objectively stronger gear.
---
blizz isn’t doing keys for the beta they’re flagging accounts for access. nothing you can do but opt-in and sub. you should know blizz said they’re not inviting too many more in at this point
---
Hmm, while I understand his and many others' point of view, I must say that I tended to like most things about TBC, and I dare say it was the most loved iteration of the game ever created. 
---
Vanilla had a charm that was never replicated, but most of the content in the first expansion was extremely satisfying stuff.  
---
Point being that there are those that would love to replay TBC as opposed to taking a complete gamble with new developers who may or may not know what the crap they are doing.
---
well............. fuck
---
From your perspective, maybe? It's sheer fun for me.
---
As if the community matters... if that was the case, then sharding (or layering, whatever) wouldn't even be tested and simply thrown out the window.
---
You... missed the point so hard. I mean, it's actually quite an accomplishment. 
---
Not everyone wants or needs to be a bleeding edge progression guild raider to enjoy the game. Some people prefer slower progression guilds, or even just other things. I know I spent a ton of time exploring the world as a vastly underleveled character back in 2004, hitting 60 almost 3 months after the game launched despite playing a ton, I still had plenty of time to sail into a pretty solid progression guild and do that for about 5 months until I decided I liked more friendly smaller guilds anyway.
---
And 6-9 months of just MC/Ony is too much even for those people.
---
6-7 months total of phase 1/2 would be a better amount. If people are taking 6 months to get to level 60 then they can hardly complain about the game leaving them behind if they only play a few hours a week. These people aren't expecting to be on the cutting edge and nor should they.
---
I believe at 60 you can still get a shard from anything level 48 and up.
---
There have always been catch up mechanics in the game and there needs to be the ide that you have to do all the previous content to be able to participate is a very bad one. And it keeps 90% of players out of new content. Now it doesn't have to be completely free and 100% of players doesn't have to be able to see new content. But if there are no way for new players or old players that simply didn't have the time/ability to commit to the game to be able to do new content the game will die pretty quickly
---
As long as they don't force me out of an instance against my will during any activity.. then maybe I could agree with you.  
---
Bottom line is that the entire idea of "sharding/layering" is flawed, and it is just a way for them to cost cut at the end of the day.
---
&gt;&gt;just MC and Ony
---
However I agree with your point which is why I think 1 year would be really dumb. MC and Ony don't get invalidated almost ever (well Ony might by late AQ/Naxx), people will be running them throughout vanilla.
---
I mean I totally love my dress up simulator 2019, but I agree that its nice to know what you're up against.
---
Sadly it's a necessary evil.  It seems that layering can handle a lot of players and is much better than sharding on average.
---
I still don't agree that flight was a huge problem.
---
WotLK had flight, right away, and I never "underexplored" the zones or "passed through" them. They were designed with flight in mind. I still ran dailies, I still got my feet on the ground, I still hit every nook and cranny and cave and so on as quests had me farming. 
---
The problem with retail WoW is there's no sense of engagement with any of the content. Flight just cuts down on the time it takes to get from A to B. So what if we now have to run around a cliff instead of fly over it. Make quests in caves, make quests on floating islands, use some imagination. Flight is such a fantastic way to make the world seem larger. Confining people to the ground just because it takes longer to travel that way doesn't mean the world is more alive.
---
But I guess that's just me. Flight didn't ruin WoW for me. pruning of abilities, loss of class homogeneity, and the loot system which just gives you incremental increases in power instead of having tiers of armor I want to farm did.
---
If you want to raid, Warlocks' DPS scales far better than hunters. I think the "pets" are more fun as well. Charm is hilarious, Felhunter's Devour Magic is great defensively and offensively, and all the sacrificial abilities are great at some part of the game.
---
Of course. I always pimped out my bank alts with good looking gear, enchants, everything I could pretty much. I even spent some serious time leveling them so that they could equip various pieces of gear I thought suited their city lifestyle.
---
Ugh this is me on a pserver... lvled a mage to 28... hunter to 31..... warlock to 22.... rogue to 15.... and priest to 14.... still don’t know what I want to play when classic hits
---
Cool I'll check it out.
---
You’re a couple weeks late, unfortunately.
---
I mean they can complain all they want, it wont change anything, and it sucks for them if they get camped by that, however it happens regardless of people streaming, it just happens more to streamers.
---
You do realize people were successfully node farming by hopping layers, right?   
---
Whether or not that is intended, we have no idea.  But the bottom line is that if they want "sharding/layering" to not impede players, then switching has to be possible or people will just get pissed when they can't easily join a friend's group on the fly without jumping through hoops.
---
Your name pretty much describes this post.
---
You realize how moronic that sounds?
---
If I want to play with my friend in an MMORPG, then I want to easily be able to do so if we are literally standing right next to each other in different "instances".  
---
Man.. I don't get how people like you even manage to scrape of a defense of the system.  I guarantee more people will be pissed off if they can't get in with their friends rather than those who will tolerate it.
---
Dudes hair lol
---
Everyone with an ounce common sense.
---
Oh you mean people don’t really circle up with their characters around one guy while he’s explaining?
---
Oh you mean calculating a percentage chance of survival to two decimal places isn’t a real thing?
---
Etc.  Etc.  Etc.
---
Yes I’m sure there were some clowntards who thought this was 100% serious the same way there are flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, and a litany of other types of people out there who can’t recognize facts and truth from BS.  The vast, vast majority enjoyed this video for what it was - a hilarious short movie.
---
Flying did not negate wpvp battlegrounds, arenas and the badly designed honor system did that. Tbc had more wpvp for me than vanilla ever did whit the introduction of daily quests no matter that everyone had a flying mount.
---
we are not even close to defeat the voidlords even the old gods are still sheming behind shadows so i doubt that but a nice idea
---
Pink haired gnome with a druid outfit. Ye I don't know what to say..
---
Love these guys.
---
Everyone with an ounce common sense knew this was a good joke back in the day.  
---
Doesn’t the server change the scale of the models? There are sources claiming races had their height adjusted in Legion. Blizzard said they have a reference 1.12.1 client, but does this also include a server/game world?
---
So you would rather permanently damage the economy of the server, and have people exploit nodes, easily escape world PVP, ruin immersion in an MMORPG and so on and so forth - just because you want to play with your precious friend that you will 100% reunite with after phase 1?
---
That sounds more moronic to me.
---
When I said about good musics in PvP videos in this sub I got a lot of downvotes... Haha
---
Shoulda gone with the korean Bandicam tech.
---
Did the brew fest quests for the hat on my orc. Tux plus hat = pimp
---
&gt;The problem with retail WoW is there's no sense of engagement with any of the content. Flight just cuts down on the time it takes to get from A to B.
---
Do you not see the hypocrisy in this statement?  
---
Flying mounts literally remove engagement with the world.  You might as well allow players to teleport at that point.
---
&gt; I personally think Main Tanks make the absolute worst Guild Leaders.
---
&gt; Guild Leaders aren’t humble and they can’t be.
---
That's not true in my experience. The leader of my vanilla guild was also our main tank and raid leader. He was a great leader and a super chill guy. He was able to get our semi-casual guild through AQ40 and part of Naxx before BC dropped.
---
In BC-Wrath I joined a different semi-casual guild as the main tank and raid leader, and was eventually Co-GM with the GM. We still did fairly well for a semi-casual guild (cleared though BT and part of Sunwell in BC and all normal raids and a good portion of H-ICC in Wrath).
---
It's how Blizzard does things since the original WoW beta, across all games :D they first invite their friends and family for an alpha, then they release a beta for the public
---
Either you are doing literally nothing but wow everyday or this is gunna be diffficult to do. Just dont say anything if you actually got this time
---
I think noone can deny that vanilla (as a game, with its design choices, systems and so on) was allowing for really unique **experiences** for the player. Those kind of experiences are no longer available in the retail game since many years.
---
Are you walking on the Path of Blood in your screenshot?
---
If so, beware the total annihilation ahead...
---
Dont think u can undo a delete.
---
&gt;6 months per phase gives us a roughly 3 year timeline until full release of everything. 
---
You don't seem to be adjusting the length of phases based on the amount of content in them, which is a serious mistake imo. Phase 2 offers very little content - a few dungeons and some world bosses 95% of the server will never interact with. PvP ranks are neat but it will lead to some awful situations.
---
&gt;That keeps away from the mistake they made the first time not leaving enough time for people to complete naxx, and allows slower more casual people to sort of keep up.
---
It wasn't a lack of people getting to 60 that caused Naxx to have low clearance rates. AQ probably not having enough time as well as Naxx-&gt;TBC not having enough time would be the causes of that. Again this plays into structuring the phases to have different lengths based on the amount of content. I think ZG also offers a bit less content than one of the tiers but certainly more than phase 2.
---
I would really hope that Blizzard doesn't just have the same length for each phase because there are drastically different amounts of content in some of them.
---
&gt;I agree the no BG's thing is a bit crappy, but that's how they decided to push the content out and we shouldn't have short windows on raid content just because of it.
---
6-7 Months of MC/Ony only is not a 'short window', when people talk about Vanilla raiding being easy and boring, MC/Ony are the posterboys of that. Guilds will smash through all of MC except perhaps Rag if their tank doesn't have FR gear.
---
We will still be clearing MC for the duration of Vanilla anyway, there's no reason to artificially lengthen the timespan.
---
No idea who Grim is but that is cool.
---
All I know is my mage will be abusing the fuck out of this.
---
Clear aoe pack. Sit for drink and food. Log off. Log alt on log off in in instantly. Log in on mage. Reset the layer by doing so and aoe farm. 
---
Seriously. With proper layer abuse we might have a server first 60 mage. Which is unheard of. It’s always a huntard.
---
I believe the regular city guards had normal stealth detection. They added special patrolling guards to the cities that had enhanced stealth detection.
---
to this day i doubt this menu really matters, the only time i got a invite by blizz was for that starcraft 2 void thing beta. And Starcraft is the only franchise i never had checked once.
---
(viable reason could be that they want to get a few people in that are not interested in the game just to see how they are reacting to it, maybe you have a better chance to get in the beta by not checking it at this point)
---
it's more of a min/ max thing. and with guilds like APES clearing naxx 2 hours after it comes out. it's deff not needed.
---
having a warlock with improved imp means you reduce that lock's damage with at least 6%, for a few hundred tank hp. In my honest opinion i don't think its worth it either.
---
totems only affect the group they are in in vanilla,  and you could have multiple buffs from the same totem type (like threat reduction AND windfury) if you have a 'totem twisting' shaman meaning they  put a totem down that gives the winfury buff (for like 12sec, not sure on exact number) then imediately put threat reduction down the next global-&gt; you got both buffs for a while) and repeat this every 12 sec.
---
so while it's doable you can imagine its pretty annoying, and you waste alot of (1s) gcd's that you could be using for other spells like heals or dispells
---
It wasn't in BC. As mentioned below this model was briefly added during vanilla. One of the pre-BC patches swapped out a number of npcs and mobs with the new blood elf models. When BC actually dropped the model was reverted to the nightelf one. No idea why, but this was a real model in game for a few weeks.
---
PvE = retail scrubs.
---
PvP = vanilla chads
---
In a good way
---
Actually both t1 and the resto talent increase the range to 30 yards. So that's it.
---
Ok. That's what I thought. So you can still tool around in enemy cities but have to be more tactical about it.
---
Nah.
---
Go back and compare BFA number vs classic number at 3 month pre launch
---
I literally care so little about streaming that I could just stop typing this in mid sente
---
I just got invited a few hours ago it’s not too late
---
leme drive da boat
---
Seriously. I didn’t think the jersey shore types played mmos.
---
😂
---
PvE servers were more popular by around 12% on US servers.
---
Warriors have rage mechanic does not drop off. You get the same rage point doing 80damage (I dont know the exact number) you get at level 10 that you get at level 60. 
---
That means a warrior critting + WF proc doing 2500damage in one second will be immediately rage capped and can now blow Sweeping Strikes + Cleave + Demoshout + stancedance + whirlwind with just this one melee swing. 
---
Therefore the better your gear, the more resource you get to spend. 
---
This also reflects in PvE. For a long time warriors use edgemasters. However once their gear is so good they generate enough rage just from WF procs and OH swings, they start to spam cleave/HS on most CGDs meaning they dont glance much anymore as 80% of their swings are yellow special attacks which cant glance.
---
Honestly, this makes me wonder just how much you could mess with the game by capping servers to random levels. We kinda see this in Twinking brackets, but that's PvP optimisation. What would be the meta in a server capped to level 45?
---
PvE all the way for me.  
---
PvP can be fun in many ways, but when you get pushed out of farming spots by a faction that outnumbers yours 2 to 1... then your tune will change.
---
Moreso just always hearing about them having an alpha for friends and family for every Blizzard game in recent years
---
Same. No subscription either. Haven't had one for months
---
Omni. I in person said the same thing. So you stopped played over ten years ago? Stfu. You’re opinions aren’t relevant anymore.
---
Quick and Dirty Math Time:
---
3000 person layer
---
Assuming 50/50 split for factions
---
1500 / layer / faction
---
3 starting zones
---
Horde: 
---
Assuming:
---
45% Undead 45% Trolls and Orcs 10% Tauren
---
650 Undead 650 Trolls and Orcs 150 Tauren
---
Pretty close to 500-1000 per starting zone assuming a fairly even split between options.
---
Can you please share your account creation, whether you're on the F&amp;F list and if you had an active subscription at the time of being invited?
---
Yeah, this is basically just level 29 twinking with a few twists.
---
Undead rogue who made some pretty good quality PvP videos for vanilla era.
---
Is there a good way to do this in reverse?
---
I may choose to roll NE on a toon, but hate their starting zone and would much rather quest in IF or SW.
---
It still doesn't magically fix the issue, just makes it a bit better. I hate the Snowy character screen too, but I think Night Elf is even worse...
---
Same.
---
For me this is not a problem sins I know that any gear I get now will give me a slight edge when the expansion arrives take tbc for example a full nax geared player have it easier when starting to level 60-70 so what at 70 I need to grind completely new gear that is part of the game experience for me. Then I also love the "fresh" experience so that might factor in for me
---
Home!
---
You don't have to search for them, though. You still find people leveling or doing World Quests like you, you still find people who want to run dungeons like you, and you have people playing pvp like you. What killed the community aspect is LFR imo, there's less people spamming chat for pugs, but there's still a system for joining a real raid as a PUG. It's less social to get invited, but there's nothing stopping people from adding people they enjoy raiding with.
---
Skill cap or gearing?
---
High skill cap is mage and rogue. 
---
Gear is warrior.
---
Watch https://youtu.be/VX7RuUcd-3Q
---
Whoever gets lucky on drop rates is can be hours to days ahead of everyone else off of a single quest. Release is going to be wild.
---
Actually a pretty great little skit made in world. It's the first big video that really drew in a lot of non-wow-gamers into seeing the game, if even for just this comical farce.
---
&gt;This is really hard to do if you don't offer item upgrades
---
That's where item side-grades come in.  Side grades that allow for new gear loadout theorycrafting is a good way to make exciting new content worthwhile without directly killing old content.
---
Forcing people to walk doesn't directly translate to engagement
---
Who the fuck said I like you?
---
Software improvements. I'm here to play classic, not Hello kitty island adventure.
---
Can’t wait to stream snipe these fucks. Can grief the shit out of them. 
---
Streamers are crap.
---
Great explanation of what it's actually for, why we need it, and why simply not having it is stupid.
---
It was a few weeks when they were using sharding.
---
The moment they announced and discussed layering, it became clear that these "layers" would persist as long as the population of a server stays high.  The wording completely changed.
---
"their respective 1-20 starting zones."
---
Stopped reading there.
---
What youre asking is completely changing classic and thats just stupid.
---
Bonus points to the gold sellers that spelled out the name of their websites with LEVITATING dead level one orcs in Orgrimmar!
---
This and Un'Goro are the best areas
---
The fact that you can't use higher level characters to help set things up makes a big difference IMO. I didn't do any Twinking in Vanilla, but in BC and early WotLK I remember that it was pretty common for players to get high level guildmates to boost them through all the dungeons and such during set-up, making the PvE meta aspects irrelevant.
---
PvP baby, I dare you to gank this big hairy hunter.
---
You didnt experience layering you experienced sharding. A layer will only be selected at login and as far as I understand it you won’t notice a switch. The reason why sharding was in the stress test was because of so many people being crammed into one area at once could crash the servers, and thats not something blizzard wants during testing.
---
This is spot on

After digging through hundreds of old screenshots, I found two relevant ones. One from retail dated [6/23/06](https://abload.de/img/wowscrnshot_062306_21gwkwa.jpg) where it's clear that the top of a male gnome's head reaches the top of a female dwarf's shoulders. Since male dwarves are a smidge taller than female dwarves, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that the top of a male gnome's head would reach a male dwarf's armpit rather than the top of their shoulders. It's quite a difference from the ["1.12"](https://i.imgur.com/Jjs8sBf.png) pic floating around where the gnome barely clears the dwarf's belt.
---
The second screenshot is dated [6/20/06](https://abload.de/img/wowscrnshot_062006_014hj7n.jpg) and it's from the PTR. Again, even considering the slight difference in distance to the camera, it's very clear here that female gnomes are **taller** than sitting female dwarves.
---
I do some private server testing and right off the bat see that, on private servers, female gnomes are [shorter than sitting female dwarves](https://i.imgur.com/7IOSuUr.jpg). Next test: [a private server male gnome with a succubus](https://i.imgur.com/CwJR85Y.jpg). Notice how low he is compared to [this BC-era gnome](https://neagon.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/vilxia.jpg). The BC gnome is standing on a very slightly higher point than the succubus, but that doesn't account for the large height difference.
---
Finally, I decided to try and recreate my PTR screenshot. [Here's](https://abload.de/img/wowscrnshot_062006_014hj7n.jpg) the same 2006 PTR screenshot from before and here is [my reenactment](https://abload.de/img/8uk6f.jpg) on a 1.12 server. The difference is plain to see.
---
But if I scale myself to 1.15x size...? I get [this](https://abload.de/img/n6j5v.jpg). And here's a [comparison gif](https://abload.de/img/compphjm9.gif). It's pretty much the exact same as the old PTR screenshot.
---
(It has nothing to do with the aspect ratio idea I've seen floating around, either. Even the 1.12 client handled widescreen resolutions [just fine](https://abload.de/img/i1k7j.jpg) - the shield and minimap are still perfectly circular).
---
So in the face of all the evidence supporting the idea that private servers have incorrect gnome sizes, and given that nobody arguing against Blizzard has provided any non-pserver evidence of
---
It's not so much that you absolutely need to and more that doing so will make your life very much easier.
---
In vanilla you have to be careful with your pulls because pulling 2 or more mobs can mean death.  You also kill things pretty slowly even when everything is going well.  Having 2 or more players together makes things faster and safer, which is good.
---
In retail you can already solo everything quickly and easily.  Having 2 or more players together just means you get less XP because it's shared between you both and there's no real benefit because you were already able to kill things quickly enough and there was no real risk of death anyway.
---
Since your average player just takes the path of least resistance, we can see the difference in the type of gameplay each scenario fosters.  In vanilla it was in your best interest even as a lazy selfish player to group up with people around you.  It made you safer and your questing got done faster.  Grouping up is the path of least resistance, it will be harder on your own.
---
In retail the path of least resistance is to talk to nobody and just do your own thing.  You don't need anyone else, they just slow you down.
---
It's not true for every single quest but it's true for a great many of them.  As other people have brought up already, good luck with the gnolls in wetlands if you're by yourself.  Or those orcs in wetlands up in the hills area.  Or murlocs literally anywhere.  Or the groups of defias all over westfall.  Or the venture co in the mines in mulgore.  I could go on and on and that's just from my experience in the recent beta...
---
I think so too. I think classic will attract lots of players who never played vanilla originally. As someone who’s been playing vanilla for on and off since release I’m excited to have heavily populated servers with people of all skill levels.
---
Drakedog now that's a name I didn't hear since a while
---
When I first heard it in my teens my first thought was "haha this fuckin nerd"
---
Really doubt it. Many people have been playing this game for yeeaaars and tbqh there just arent that many items or build combos. The absolute ideal amount of each stat for each class is known and I can’t see it changing without blizzard changing something
---
Why so aggro man? Fuck off.
---
I know there was like some items that had stupid respawn times. But were far and few I believe.
---
No, the post says 24th.
---
Not sure how true it is, but I was told the optimal way of leveling was to give up on VW tanking, and go with a Drain Life build because, as you've noticed, VW isn't too hot with the agro. It's basically your normal 30/0/21 build, but with a priority on the Drain Life talents in the Affliction tree.
---
You just dot up the mob(s) and drain life tank them using a Succubus or Felhunter depending on your preference for pvp if that's a concern.
---
Battlefield Minimap was present in vanilla, just without flags shown on it.
---
Like they are going to report stuff
---
Look, Chad plays wow...
---
I actually loved the change...the first time through it.
---
Yeah makes sense to me. Building up some goodwill instead of trying to cash in right away.
---
Yup, Classic will be huge.
---
Warlocks aren't very common on the horde side either. There's just less of them on the alliance. C'mon keep playing horde you'll find a raid spot easy pz.
---
this debate has multiple times for multiple games, yes streamers can stop streaming however it benefits gaming companies to not have streamers quit. they own the game, giving them the ultimate power on if stream sniping is a punishable offence. sucks ass but its the way it is.
---
2006 humour was weird.
---
says the guy running around with a lv. 1 going look at me daddy asmon look at me.
---
I got it and don’t even play it lol.
---
I hope not so I can dodge streamer realms. Also Im sure pop is going to be too big for one pvp realm to exist.
---
would you sell your acc or no?
---
An item is an upgrade or not un less you design the new content around the new items say onyxia scale cloak or something similar. There is problems whit this aswell as benefits. Some of the problems are this will have huge ramifications on pvp. Alsow you risk increasing the grind to un bearable levels say you need an item on your mages to kill the next boss if the item doesn't dropp you just forced the raid to stay at current progression one more week. If the items are not necessary to kill the new bosses and not upgrades I'll just run through the instance ones and then I'm done
---
We need a time jump. 1000 years, reset the world.

... hey!!! ... what were you thinking you perverts ! :P :P
---
the lvl 40 mount is definitely free. I'm also planning on having my epic mount way before phase two so i'm okay with a free mount at 40 and a regular epic mount at 60. With rep(honored i believe) and rank 3 pvp the epic costs like 800g so not so much more than what the warlock epic costs(640ish). Honestly grinding for the epic mount is more likely less work than going through all the hoops and materials for the epic lock mount quest.
---
the old zones had so much more charm to them
---
yeah The Unguided definitely has that older Sonic Syndicate sound. Great choice for pvp music. But theres such a huge amount of good songs out there
---
Its nice to see this but something we really do need a update on is the combat text, this needs to change and I would love a update on it as the current one is subpar to the old combat text which is super sad
---
Just one suggestion... Since there are gonna be 6 phases, and some items/npcs/quests are locked until we enter that phase, are you gonna show that in some way? Could be useful
---
I think people tend to forget this as well. 1-60 is already a slow leveling experience. Adding another 20+ levels makes it a daunting task for new players, and honestly very disheartening. It kind had to have a change, or we may never get a healthy amount of new players to the game.
---
Im 30 this year, there is something as wasted time. I dont do one specific thing ever irl, I dont do anything if its not everything on the same day, I cant just go buy shoes, I have to wait until I have something else I need too, maybe I need to go buy a new monitor for my PC, thats it, hell yes I can now go buy shoes and a monitor at the same time to not waste time. It sucks to be an adult and work all the time, and having a girlfriend, I cant even imagine having a kid right now, Id die.
---
What the hell was the "Wombat of Slaying" supposed to be anyways?
---
What a shock! When you’re toxic as shit online and people don’t like you, and your constantly broadcasting your location, people come kill you. Kinda funny how that works?
---
Shaman can effectively tank in dungeons and even in many raid encounters with the right experience and attitude.
---
You have a long road ahead of you, especially if you are new to the game: https://classicwow.live/guides/154/guide-to-shaman-tanking
---
Source? because someone with beta access in the warlock discord says it procs on dot kills and even when your pet gets the kill.
---
Go to naxx, let people really experience it and when Blizz has too many "I do not know what to do anymore" cancelled subs, reset Classic.
---
Like once every 5 years. And if we get TBC, might as well put it on another server.
---
Almost nobody uses on-premise servers anymore.
---
Man I’m just not sure about this wpvp statement.. those are the 3 main classes that I will be up against in vanilla. The other ones from what I’ve seen are a kite game with dots to wear people down. I may not win but neither will they because if things get too hairy I can dip out and carry on without ever dying
---
For christ sake that's some grade A drama right there. Ohhh big fucking deal he stared one second at another stream.
---
Thank you for your explanation, really appreciate it. Guess we both have different view into this topic. 
---
For you and a lot of other player you want to connect and create a lasting friendship with the players you encounter; while for me other players are a means to an end to the content I want to complete :P
---
For me they ran for exactly 26 hours. R u sure you converted the time zones right?
---
I wanna go home right fucking now.
---
You assume I didn't play Vanilla, I have, from the 4th month in 2005 right until BC hit. I remember. Stop acting like you're the only one who knows anything. Your attitude definitely deserves the downvoting.
---
Beautiful.
---
Barrens chat, anal spam, chuck norris jokes. YES BABY
---
Just hit 30 and show no signs of slowing down!
---
&gt; the tensions between them and the other factions was explored.
---
but their tensions between hu and be WAS previously explored.
---
Hah, I did that too. My bank alt in BC was decked out with a Red Defias Mask with +8 agi, two STV arena trinkets, pants with Nethercleft, the works.
---
None of the things said in the video made any sense.  They arbitrarily said things using skill names and none of it was accurate.  The encounter was completely fabricated as well.  I can understand why people who didn't play the game would be fooled but anyone who played WoW at all knew immediately that it was a joke as soon as they started talking.
---
Ah, the drums of war for beta testers. Those are my favourite.
---
It surely does.  It forces you to interact with other players and mobs.
---
... Did you forget that nobody liked BFA and it’s regarded as one of the worst expansions blizzard released? 
---
I can also tell you why, the game wasn’t rewarding enough for most players to stay invested. The people who are left playing are the kinds of people who don’t mind it. 
---
This isn’t a natural decay, the game became very boring very fast at max level. 
---
This is why it’s different.
---
Then you stop playing. Why is that concept so hard to grasp?
---
System of a down, disturbed, linkin park, rob zombie, powerman 3000, breaking benjamin, the list goes on...
---
Fucking love me some Malcolm in the Middle. Hilarious show, good memories.
---
They definitely used to, or at least managed their own servers at a larger facility. AWS is probably just way more flexible now.
---
It's not that I'm completely against drain tanking, I realise it's very effective for levelling. I just really enjoy blowing people up in PvP! And chances are I'll be playing Sm/Ruin at 60 to switch between PvE and PvP so if I can get used to the playstyle whilst levelling even better
---
I need more old-school-PvP-videos in my life.
---
Laughed a bit harder than I should have hahaha
---
send you a DM
---
But that is just perpetuating the cycle of making gear obsolete over and over, leading to a repetitive pointless grind for gear that will just be replaced by greens next expac...  
---
I just imagine a game where gear is more of a preferential choice based on playstyle, build, etc rather than a constant carrot chase.
---
A few questions about a leveling build.
---
I was reading earlier that the best way to go about leveling is to drop any idea of VW tanking, and go with a 30/0/21 build that shifts points out of Curse of Exhaustion and a few points from Suppression, into Improved Drain Life and Fel Concentration for Drain Life tanking.
---
Is Drain Life tanking, and thus a more Drain Life focused build, the ideal way to level? What impact, if any, would this have on how you PvP while leveling? I'm assuming at 60 it's best to respec out of it into a more standard SM/Ruin build?
---

I've convinced my friend that ONLY plays ESO on PlayStation to play classic on his laptop with me. Rolling PvP horde.
---
Retail is private server lingo for official WoW servers. IE: Wow that you pay money for.
---
People who have never played private servers or have low IQs refer to only BFA as retail but not classic. But classic IS retail.
---
His Twitter is @grimtherogue, hasn't said anything on there yet, hope it is him, would love to see another grim video.

Back when there was a certain mystery to this zone and it wasn't occupied by Darkspear but instead by zombies and Zalazane's followers. Good times.
---
Mcconnel reactions are just the best man!
---
Because I don't want to stop playing.
---
Classic is retail too.
---
Were you even born at the time?
---
August needs to come faster
---
No would be great, I tried searching the old eu forum on the wayback machine but couldn't find it.
---
Not while they were part of the WoW era Alliance. To clarify what I'm saying: I wanted them to be part of the Alliance during TBC. And while they're part of the Alliance in TBC, I'd like it if, during this hypothetical situation, they explored the tensions between the blood elves and the other members of the Alliance that arose from the history between them, such as the Third War that happened during the events of War Craft 3, and their shared heritage and cultural differences with the night elves.
---
the 40 mount is free but the 60 one is pretty lengthy to get, it's kind of a tradeoff
---
I made a raid even if with offline friend and raid marked all the truesight guards.
---
I think it was TBC when they introduced stealthed truesight roof guards that made stealthing in (atleast) orgrimmar a big pain in the ass and honestly barely worth it anymore.
---
No thank you. Please don’t play classic.
---
It’s people like you that we have to blame for the current state of retail wow.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Lost all credibility when you said you love Tipout.

Seriously though, don't stream if you don't want to deal with the repercussions.  Also, was that video for other streamers to watch because wtf are viewers supposed to do about this stupid problem that they want to happen anyway because it's funny?
---
Imagine broadcasting your position in a PVP game to thousands of people and then being shocked when someone takes advantage of that
---
Sure!

13 years ago this was top notch, still a great watch!
---
I'd like world pvp only to be longer than a month. Make it two.
---
Nail on the head there. Im not sure how many people are around at Blizzard from that time so it would require and entire new team to be taught this and understand why it matters.
---
Damn, don't report for rule 8
---
I would hate it all my continuous hard work would be for nought. And there would be impossible for new players to play. I love that I get to do "low level" stuff ones more I love that the next best thing is not 10+ hours farming and 4 hours wiping on a progress boss now don't get me wrong I live that to but I would not want to do only that forever.
---
The precedent is there too. Just look at OSRS compared to RS3.
---
Thank you!
---
it sucks that you want to have a pvp community, we've already deluded ourselves around here into thinking we NEED crossrealm because 15 years ago some people played on ridiculously imbalanced servers that were almost entirely lacking the opposite faction which made their queue times too long
---
convenience totally didn't ruin vanilla and crossrealm was a part of vanilla for a few months so it's entirely okay to me if they decide to preemptively take a massive shit on the pvp community
---
We always knew this was happening. They where always going to go whit the 1.12 build. And trust me cross realm bgs solves alot more problems than it creates.
---
imagine following every little drama bewteen streamers
---
Security at a rehab center here patrol every 2 hours wow in-between
---
Well, it's not that long ago, but I guess you don't remember how people were leaving literally weeks into BfA because of it's dogshit class design and azerite armor.
---
I'm not saying some people won't leave Classic too, especially those who will play it only because of hype. But there will be way bigger interest about Classic few months after it was released than there was about BfA. 
---
We're not even year into BfA and it already feels more dead ingame than any expansion during content drought. I'm pretty sure Classic will be still going strong even year after it was released.
---
I'm having to try very hard to not take a week off work for launch. I just got a competitive promotion and it almost feels worth risking that advancement
---
Nah the raid leader did that to humor his guild, seen many people who were in the guild say that it was like a character he was playing just for laughs.
---
Not true. Lots of entities still hold large on-prem footprints. Cloud is see now as complimentary to on-prem, not an either-or option.  
---
Source: I'm a solution architect who sells servers and cloud services.
---
&gt; I also think going off world makes the game seem small too
---
Absolutely this. With every new land that is added, the player base is split up more. That's just unhealthy for any game. I would rather just keep everything in Azeroth.
---
Then you don't want Vanilla. Ask Blizzard to create a new game for you. Classic is bringing back Vanilla because it's not available. Because it "went to shit" as you put it. You want it to go "to shit" again?
---
"But it won't be the same! *This* time they will change it so it will be to my liking!" No they won't. And what about all the other people who don't like what you like? "Don't care, Blizzard should cater to me, me, me!". But they won't. The Blizzard of old is dead. Most of the people who designed Vanilla have left. Blizzard will never create anything resembling Vanilla again.
---
If you "change Vanilla *again*" people succeed, all you will have achieved is to destroy Vanilla again.
---
So once again, if you want something else then Vanilla, ask Blizzard for it honestly. Ask them to create a *new*, *separate* game for you. Based on Vanilla for all I care but remember what I said when you actually get it and find that it's not at all what you hoped it would be.
---
Sorry for being bitter. :)
---
this is not a sound financial move
---
You will still have a pvp community. The amount of top tier premades are limited eaven in a battle group. After a short while you will recognise all of the top players
---
&gt;Blizzard’s cloud infrastructure is, as I understand it, built on AWS.
---
They do private cloud as well, based on Openstack, along with virtualised on traditional hardware. Overwatch is alledgedly running almost exclusively on AWS, although I can't find anything official that confirms it. WoW originally ran on HP/HPE bladeservers, mostly using Oracle DBs. Anyone got any newer info about what platform WoW runs on?
---
If you are interested in theorycrafting these ideas, you might wanna join a new discord server I just created. It's focus is on discussing different strats with no exact focus on build or theory requirements. It is in the early stages right now but there should be a ton of people joining interested in classic over the time. So far the tc community is lacking in ideas, especially since most tc groups focus min maxing aspects much more, than all the possible options for playing the game.
---
I'll roll right into that Undercity if you know what I mean. BOOM!  
---
Just kidding, that was a Thunder Bluff.
---
Why did this get downvoted to -1?
---
Every cross realm bg post is always the same! Muh rivalries muh enemy faction friends. Seeing the name of someone more than once isnt a huge sacrifice for the quality of life cross realm bgs brings. And if you spam bgs and pvp all the time anyways people will see you and recognize you.
---
It was a meme before your time.

Farmed in Unguro and turned in at the druid trainer in darnassus for rep and some low level herbs. Repeatable
---
No flying mounts at all.. killed so much of the game
---
I'll be playing 5-8 pm JST GMT+9 weekdays. Think that's kinda close to you.
---
Yeah, no. I very clearly remember pre and post crossrealm and the community was dead at that point. You will never get passed "that's the premade from XXXX server". 
---
Once BC hit I went to play with a guild from the opposite faction of my server because the community was tight enough pre crossrealm for people to actually know each other. That would not have been possible if crossrealm was there at launch.
---
Damn it took so long with my shitty internet to load this forum !

Thanks for being the one shining light. People are being unnecessarily strict here. Having a 50g respect doesn’t add an extra layer of skill, it doesn’t add immersion, it doesn’t add something to achieve or be proud of. It’s just a huge tax on playing a different part of your character. Those of us who have full time jobs and want to experience raiding and pvp you basically have to pick one. I’m not talking about raid progression or grinding high rank pvp I’m taking about just being able to experience both in a week.
---
I wonder how people would feel if there was a 200g fee per week to enter a raid? 2g toll cross into a new area? 10g fee to play a battleground? It would certainly make the game harder and be a way to get money out of the game
---
What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
There were no zombies, mon.
---
I don't think Blizz has ever used their own physical data centres (apart from the first version of battle.net which ran on a single computer at Blizzard.), it just doesn't make sense from a cost perspective. For example Warcraft 3 ran on AT&amp;T's servers.
---
I thought they said cross realm pvp won’t be in until one of the later patches? Maybe they are just testing it?
---
Then the issues are the zones.. too big. Shrink them down and get rid of flying.
---
Agreed!
---
Nope your not alone
---
Hi, /u/csirke4
---
Oof, I seem to be remembering wrong, sorry. Well... but there were definitely felines there. :p
---
I didnt found any official number. Last one was 10 million during legion.   
---
So, where did you get your numbers from? To me it looks like out of your ass (or from elses ass for that matter). But I am happy to eat my words if you can link a noteworthy source :)
---
i dont think you're seeing the gold issue on the streams at the moment as when you hit the level cap xp is converted into money so they will have a fair bit of cast at level 30 if they are doing the quests, but in live it will be a lot harder to get gold, like running about on your level 40 mount for ages at level 60 hard to get gold xD
---
at least we can say we posted on the boards about it
---
Black evening dress, off-hand 10lb fish.

I want to be mad at Blizzard and think that everything is incorrect and that they are lying! I'm Alex Jones and Blizzard are definitely lying about the SIZE OF GNOMES!!!!!

Because this is Classic WoW. Emphasis on 'Classic"
---
Hey hey guys BFA bad HAHAHAH RIGHT CASUAL SCRUBS SUCK COMPARED TO MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
UPVOTES TO THE LEFT!
---
Gear resets are among the worst things to ever happen to wow.
---
How is Classic + added content after we exhaust all classic content going to make the game go to shit?  It's not expansions that drastically change the game that I want, I just want more content in the current game world.
---
Agammagan EU (or whatever it was spelled)
---
I thought the stretch from 13 to 14 required 16 hours a day even with premade. No that I know just what I heard.
---
Cool : )
---
"No life" now means putting 20-40 hours a week into the game. "No life" then meant putting 60-80 hours a week into the game. Good luck no lifing two toons
---
I like the undead models from vanilla a lot more
---
I wonder if this a layering thing. I don't remember this happening in vanilla, but much later on I do remember a similar thing happening on the river that separates durotar and barrens. The crocodiles on the northern part of the river would disappear upon entering the barrens half of the river, and respawn by entering durotar.
---
Didn't have anything to do with targeting though, and your mob doesn't look like he's despawning. Maybe he's just evading by distance and aggroing by distance because he's 20+ levels higher than you.
---
I wish I had known this before making the Wetlands death run. 8-9 deaths, multiple several minute rez timers and 20-30 minutes of running could've been avoided D:.
---
I also think the "slippery slope" is a real thing.
---
For example I think Guild banks would make a good addition to classic. It brings only benefits and would not impact the classic experience in any meaningful way. But still I'm against adding that feature. If you start with one little thing you open the path for other things. And there lies the danger, who can say what else might be added and what retail fanboys might want.
---
The only reason I can live with the changes they already made to classic is a feature you can't get on private servers. And that being no corruption in the admin team and no bullshit like "oh the top raiding guild got 2 bindings in one mc run on the very week they where released". The only way Blizzard Dev's gonna accept something from you is when you wanna buy them a beer. By the way someone buy Omar a beer please.
---
The fact that you had to go through all this trouble to prove Blizzard right about their own game is so fucking sad lmao. Kudos to you anyhow.
---
I don't like blizzards modern cartoony art direction. They decided to upgrade the textures without upgrading the models and call it an "art style". Old WoW had a more serious look to it, even if the graphics are worse, I can still immerse myself and use imagination to make them look like the cinematics. With the cartoony style there isn't much left to the imagination.
---
Splitting the community is arguably way worse than adding new content that might be "bad".
---
I really am against sharding, whether they call it "layering" or not. It's the same thing change my mind you can't.
---
Obligatory screenshot (name redacted to protect the not-so-innocent): https://i.imgur.com/LlXxIXv.jpg

Higher level friends mostly only matter when it comes to getting your gear before you level up. Not really an issue with the 30 cap right now.
---
You can have 40 players and intricate involved fights. Why would you think not?
---
Hell, they could even add difficulties to the current available dungeons and I'd be happy. Running a more difficult version of MC.. or even ones with different modifiers/add extra boss mechanics. Could have leaderboards/achievements/titles
---
I’m not a native speaker of it but I basically learned it with wow (and the need to read Star Wars books - literally sat stubbornly with a dictionary lol). Thanks to that, by the time I had English in school I was on par with my teacher (who was just a stand in to be fair as the school was lacking a dedicated English teacher at the time). I later used the skill when travelling as well,  and ended up living on and off on my own in Australia age 16-22. Today I study English and psychology at my local uni in Northern Europe ^^ I genuinely think people underestimate the valuable things wow and gaming in general offers. It’s made me very multi cultural for one.
---
I prefer the old female Tauren models as well. The new ones are horrid.
---
Wepon skills are the only rly usefull racial there is after cap. Like trolls with +5 bow skill. Wich gives u 0,6 % hit. But with the items in the game it’s kinda useless tho.. 
---
Or if u takes orc 5+ axe wich makes crul’shorukh Edge of chaos(1h axe) bis for orcs where maladeath(1h sword) is bis for any orther race.
---
And by biss i mean biss from t2 not counting TF with :p
---
I guess that's why he played a rogue. So he can kill people when they are on low health.
---
There is literally a group finder in vanilla wow. People just don't use it.
---
That's not how creating games work. There is no "just adding more content" button which results magically in a game which is "exactly like Vanilla just *better*". If Blizzard starts adding and changing stuff in Classic because they caved in to people demanding changes it won't be Vanilla anymore. And it'll "go to shit", just maybe in a slightly different way than how it went to shit Vanilla -&gt; BfA.
---
I think (hope) that Blizzard is not *that* stupid. That they'll not change Classic. That they'll bring Classic TBC instead (on separate servers). Buf if I'm wrong, just remember this post. I'll be right about "Classic+" being not what you hoped it would be. :)
---
r/woooosh?
---
Uhhhh... the community managers are communicating on behalf the CURRENT, ACTIVE developers of the game. The people who have the original reference version of Vanilla as it was running internally to compare against. The people implementing Classic right now. How on earth can you justify your statement that shit said by people who haven't worked at Blizzard for over a decade has more weight to it than people who work there right now, some of whom have always worked on WoW since the beginning and didn't leave Blizzard.
---
Holy shit I didn't think people could get any more misguided but.. you really did take the cake with that comment.
---
I also think that MC will be trivial the way they implement it. Once everyone has the basic strats, it will be a pick-up thing.
---
ZG and BWL though will require voice. I dont see any pick up going through razorgore for months.
---
he has a youtube channel where he can be contacted. if anyone wants to know whether he's playing they should try and get in contact personally
---
60% Flying
---
280% Flying
---
The 310% flying speed was only on a few specific mounts and I THINK it was only added in WotLK. They also at some point (via Achievement?) made it so that once you had the 310% flying it was no longer tied to those specific mounts. The most common one probably the one you got from What a long strange trip it's been (Violet Protodrake?).
---
Haha thanks me too. It was well worth the hassle!
---
OP posting out of context clip to stir up drama and karma. Why
---
Think you had it rough?
---
I didn't even had Internet. When I wanted to cast a spell I had to send the command with a racing pigeon.
---
If there was a toggle option I would def be more interested in playing Classic. I don’t want to go back to slouching orcs
---
But probably on a non-US server, right?
---
i dont know if people do this on purpose or what  
---
its way more likely that people just search for "world of warcraft" than "bfa" or whatever else variation of it exists  
---
"world of warcraft" is always current, "wow classic" is not
---
Brother, every day that I am not in this beta I feel like I am being stabbed by a thousand needles. I am dryer than this beautiful gulch.
---
Remember Tokens were introduced in vanilla.
---
I agree, my problem with the guide is just not having any number comparison, but opting to say  '' their threat is nearly equal to that of a pure protection warrior ''. Then referring to rockbiter math ( which is fair ) but we aren't seeing the output or what's to gain from this, or if you're gating your dps'ers.
---
All in all, i'm all for ''meme'' speccs but you can't compare things subjectively like this and expect to be taken seriously : &gt;
---
Graphics aren't the same debate as models and animations.
---
If it's gonna be the two of you most of the time, I would say leveling the same class is a really good idea because you'll be able to travel at the same speed (in cat or, later, cheetah form). Shaman would also be a good choice with ghost wolf. Keep in mind I'm not 100% sure on the levels at which these skills are obtained, but better 2 druids or druid+shaman than, say, a priest.
---
That would be a dream come true.
---
More epic quest lines for shit similar to those of Quel Serar, Benediction, RhokDelar, Thunderfury etc.
---
Open up new zones, new 5 man dungeons, would be awesome.
---
Because that is what it was then. Nothing is subjective, playing classic is playing classic. That's like saying imma play some classic pac man and you start playing and it's something made in 2019.
---

First generation of rank 14s on a private server yes you would. 1.2 - 2mill honor caps for bracket 1 every week. I was a rogue... this was my life... everyday... for over 3 months.

Gnome or die

We should be compansated for the emotional stress of this bug with beta invites!

Also classic is like fine wine! Gets better with age since everything else gets worse. Noone wants a classic bottle filled with new wine, we want the stuff that's been chillen in there since 04!
---
Except people who want to play with a PvE ruleset
---
testing ahead of schedule which is better of us

Classic+ &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expansions that split the community and add bullshit QoL changes that get the game closer to retail
---
Holy crap 275 comments in this thread and 320 views on my picture, gnome height is serious business :D
---
I admit this is one of the funniest things private servers got wrong.
---
So people really think that 1.12 isn’t going to get boring? I remember at the end of vanilla it was starting to get incredibly stale, there’s only so many times you can do the same content over and over before it gets boring.
---
I think if blizzard can implement new content and keep the vanilla ‘game design choices’ then classic will be huge. I’d personally love to see them make some small balance changes to fix the broken shit (hunter scaling for example would be needed if there gonna be harder stuff than naxx).
---
No it's not at all. There is no "splitting the community". It's a strawman. If after they played through Classic there are no TBC servers, people will just leave. They won't be playing your "Vanilla+" game. Exactly Just like how people left WoW and are now waiting for Classic.
---
(Yes, there are always some who are too addicted and even if they dislike the game, they play. But overall you can't force people to play a game they don't like.)
---
I definitely agree that gear progression within a expansion should be gradually and not overly fast but I still think a gear reset every 2-3 years is necessary and I thin more in the lines of a 60 bis sould be as good as a 69 blue/green player you should always have to do the pre raid dungeons in every expansion
---
Tryna keep a zugzug down cuz he green
---
same girl but she's not wearing make up in the right pic
---
Brilliant, this brings back so many memory's from the auction house in ironforge for me. I had a little auction gnome named monopolyman, might have to login to my old account and see if he is still there.
---
This is all my own opinion, but I would love to see new content but with exactly the points Mark made. 
---
If there would be additional content, it would be better within Kalimdor and Eastern-Kingdoms, while adding things to lower level areas to keep them relevant. There are plenty of places and things left that can be fleshed out, as well as more professions utility, more gold and resource sinks (like reputation).
---
As for other things such as class/spec balance, they should be extremely careful to maintain class identity. The same goes with increments in power with new gear or mounts. I'm also leaning towards the opinion that a new level cap is a bad thing.
---
You know, they're testing layering an improved version of sharding handling A LOT more people based off the entire continent for the community aspect of the game and no day1 12 hours queues and DCs but yeah blizzard doesn't care.
---
Not so sure, I played during the stress test and the thief catcher guard was in Ironforge.
---
Blood Troll models. The only good thing in BFA.
---
The animation rigs are horrible on the new models.
---
Only way you could use a flying mount is if - It took a bag slot, it cost a *lot* of gold, had a *huge* cool down (talking 4hr+), lasted up to 1 minute.
---
Adding TBC only servers will MOST DEFINITELY split the community.  It'll be people that want to stay in classic/60 gameplay vs people that want TBC.  It's quite disingenuous to think otherwise.
---
Its interesting that charts are showing "wow legion" searches was 3 times more than bfa, i am wondering how more wow classic will rise in time compared to "wow legion"
---
Then don't fucking play. This is done choosingbeggars shit at this point. You motherfuckers beg and bitch and moan for classic. Now blizzard does ONE fucking thing to make the game more accessible to people during launch and you shit your pants with rage. You have ZERO proof of how to control laying hopping, you have ZERO proof that doing so will generate more lotus spawns, you have ZERO proof that people will be irrevocably ahead. Stop aching like a prissy little bitch and take what the world gives you. And count your lucky stars J Allen Brack deigned to even make classic.
---
Don't forget the monocle!
---
I would pick content, over no content. But hey, if you like swimming in the heap of shit that was WoD, you do you bud. Unlike you, I'm not sad enough to tell others what they should and shouldn't like.
---
I would say that's it. Next would be Cath and I just don't see that happening. But I'm hoping they try. I haven't even seen them wipe once or a single death. But haven't watched all of their runs yet.
---
Troll deep?
---
didn't tuxedo require level 30?
---
I am following the ancient tradition of naked female dwarf nank alts
---
Yup!  This is the stance we need to take.
---
I'd need to up my efficiency, I'll put in the pipeline.
---
Solution to that is not to play.
---
In the system I was suggesting, there is also the matter of levelling up again which takes time. Also, after levelling there is to run lvl 60 dungeons to equip for the raids.
---
https://willitclassic.com/
---
I would really like new models and old animations and sounds that being said i love the old models because that's what i remember looking at and thinking "this is going to be so fun" . I honestly think a toggle would have been their best option.
---
That'd be dope.
---
I'd bring'er around for another spin.
---
Something...something...maybe??? something to with "Classic"?
---
It clearly isn't intended behaviour which is why it is being tested with a low amount of people (regular beta) and the stress test (massive influx of people in the world)
---
I prefare the old female dwarf models over the retail ones
---
Both are in phase 1.
---
Precisely. If all content has to always be accessible then that dilutes the content imo. I understand not everyone has the time, I’ve been there plenty of times, but that doesn’t mean the game should cater to them - there are others that do. Let wow be wow.
---
About races:
---
I cant really stand draenai. If we had em I'd much rather have their withered form from WC3.
---
Belfs should be closer to elfs in vanilla.
---
Mostly I dislike the worgen, perhaps they should just be a faction and not a race (raids, dungeons related to them?)
---
Goblins I kinda understand but perhaps just add thei involvement as factions and dont make them playable?
---
So perhaps I just like the idea of belfs and they might be the only race I could see being added.
---
 What vanilla could kinda use are better factions (think the belf faction in Ghostlands in TBC)
---
About zones and dungeons:
---
I could get behind new dungeons for the levelling bracket but not so much about new zones. Depends very much on the execution of it. New quests would be logical to add if new zones and instances made an appearance.
---
About professions:
---
I cant stand jewelcrafting (gems, freaking gems...). Tho it is a somewhat logical thing to add in rpgs I still dislike it greatly. Just brings another hoop to hop in pursuit of the bis gear.
---
Your idea for inscription is interesting, at keast the way its levelled. Not so sure about what it should do. DM library would be a hub of sorts for it?
---
About you last bit, the warcraft buff. It would kinda just be a vanity thing to make the game harder?
---
Cross realm BG is literally a benefit, you actually can not hate on faster queues. Imagine sitting a 15 minute queue or sitting a 1 minute queue, you know which one you'd rather.
---
Question is why even do that quest in the first place when the amount of time spent camping you could of made 3 times the amount of xp grinding. This kind of thing will pit you in the pack.
---
The higher levels just made it easier, the real challenge was to not actually gain a level while gearing.
---
True, it seems like a good initial quick fix, but this also means they have to keep a proper reference size for gnomes written down so when they make new ones in the future they aren't too large, since they will inevitably be scaled up by the server. 
---
This may seem like a good idea at first, but this is also why modern WoW has so much goddamn fucking spaghetti code. They really did not think this game was going to be going a decade later, much less approaching two. There is just so much shit stacked on top of each other, I am honestly surprised they have gotten a working classic client out this fast.
---
&gt; Are you looking to combat the “what now” factor, months after phase 6 (final release in classic)? It’ll be interesting to see as I’m still thinking about the options myself. Do we perform a server wipe and do it all over again? Do we introduce a system like you mentioned? Do we keep the server and make a TBC Classic server that you can rollover you lvl 60 on? Do we continue newly developed lvl 60 content?
---
Fighting the "What now" factor is a big thing that should be addressed. Especially if WoW Classic will stay... well Classic. There is only so much content that can be released.
---
The other thing I'd like to see addressed is the usual "Ah shit, I joined too late and everyone is already uber-equipped, guilds are full and everything is already done, why even subs and start playing this now".
---
One big helps of "seasons/league/whatever" is that it helps player that missed the train once, to being able to jump on board at a later time and experience a "fresh server".
---
Also, I totally forgot to mention that Character that reache the end of a season, once it resets, could/should be moved into a sort of "catch-all" server/league etc. as /u/lol1dragon kindly reminded me [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsjm9o/just_spitballing_here_but_if_wow_classic_gain/eons2k4/).
---
Sins I never was in a good guild I have have to carry 40 man through most of vanilla and tbc content. And here I'm not talking whit my gameplay which is average at best but whit my ability to keep researching and explaining the simplest things over and over and over again. The amount of times one person fucked up and kill the raid is astonishing. This is alot easier in 25 mans. If you look at raids in vanilla and tbc you can also se the difference in raid design it was the 25 man that made it possible.
---
Damn... only three more months...
---
Everything is possible with the right amount of a FUCKTON OF MONEY

I’ll download your adding folder if you fileshare it somewhere. 
---
I have a few of the ones you do already. But, I was looking for the others as well.
---
beware the thief catcher in Ironforge...
---
So basically cheating..
---
Well they have a very limited beta community, so even if CRBGs weren't going to be in classic once it goes live, it stands that it would be in beta for testing purposes to ensure the games filled up.
---
You're absolutely right, it shouldn't be enforced upon players, I discuss it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsjm9o/just_spitballing_here_but_if_wow_classic_gain/eons2k4/).

In Wrath times I got a job on an oil base. My job was to write time sheets, the last guy who had the job showed me how to do it. He used maybe 6-7 hours doing the dayshift, and 4-5 on the night shift (12 hour shifts) after two days I stopped using the paper sheets he gave me and I put it all into Excel instead. Then I'd just copy from the day before, change dates and perhaps change a few people who were not on shift ect. 
---
Spent maybe 10 minutes on both night and day shift timesheets every day. The rest of the time I played World of warcraft 😏

Having nameplates on showing at further distance would reveal those guys behind the tree before you would get any close to that tree, making it impossible for them to gank you
---
Truuu. Idk how people don't want faster queues, like cmon
---
SHHH you'l make him realise he's been an idiot all this time and scared for nothing.
---
I enjoy the zone except for the fact SO many abilities break in a 3d combat environment
---
Cata had the four totems at once with the extra pop up bar for saving your favorite set ups. It was excellent. I miss shamans actually using totems...
---
Sure you can!  Depending on how long ago it was, blizz should still have all the data to restore your chars.
---
I got into the stress test, &amp; was invited to the beta yesterday. 
---
There’s still hope.
---
&gt; Ik it existed but I'm saying it made sense because you eventually mounted faster beasts. And it made sense that they were faster.
---
Fast flying in TBC had a cost of 5200 Gold. The vast majority of players could never afford it. They were stuck at 60%.
---
Well then I system like PoE implement would be perfect probably.
---
I mention that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsjm9o/just_spitballing_here_but_if_wow_classic_gain/eons2k4/) but in short it could be like this:
---
*N* servers have this system, and 1 server is the "fallback" in which all patch are released like they did historically and all characters from the other servers are moved into once their seasons/league reset.
---
Who doesn't want to play these "races" of sort could just play on this one (two, three, whatever) server(s) while others play on these others that are known to have custom themed seasons.
---
How do you know they are on three different layers though? With potentially 3k players per layer and layers prioritising guildmates on the same layer I don't think it'll be as easy as you assume it will be. 
---
It will not be more efficient than just staying in your own layer as by the time you find someone who can make you jump to layer two you might as well just keep mob farming and mining ores as there's no guarantee that the other layer with 3k players on it won't have mobs and resources already tapped.
---
It just doesn't work like BFA sharding does, if you have 3k players per layer and 6k players per server you have two layers on a full server.
---
This was not in vanilla. It was introduced in tbc with the patch 2.3.0. The reason he couldn't repick in this clip was because of the 3 second debuff that prevents him juggling the flag.
---
Here are the patch notes for 2.3.0:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0
---
In the pvp section under battlegrounds it is stated:
---
&gt;Dropping the Flag in a battleground will now result in a debuff &gt;that will not allow you to pick up the flag again for 3 seconds.
---
It would be awesome if anyone with a beta access could report this.
---
I think they could add an option to enable the new models easily. I mean I understand that is classic but we also live in an Era where graphics matters.
---
Why the hell would you want 1 million polygon character models with 1 polygon armor?
---
tbc didn't have any wpvp. daily quests? flying? fuck off to retail, thanks.
---
Who hurt you as a child?
---
You'll be lucky to level from 40-41 in a six hour session in classic.
---
In this sub: Anyone who plays less than me = ugh casual. Anyone who plays more / better than me = ugh neckbeard.
---
Homogenization already can't happen, because you have way too many aspects of the game which add to the overall game and are important in which certain specs excel.
---
Prot paladins can pull full fields in WPL and AoE tank them, grind people to level 35 in 4hours and do just fine in 5men content.
---
Enhancement shamans with proper gear can 1v1 any class in the game.
---
31 disc priests can powerinfuse elemental shamans for 4000 damage chain lightning crits.
---
The problem is when people anticipate that each and every spec can do well in raids even though they'd become blatantly overpowered in PvP.
---
Raids are maybe 20% of the time you actually spent in the game when you seriously progress and then roflstomp Ony + MC + BWL in one night henceforth.
---
Yeah like when they tried and failed in retail.
---
Hum yeah I don't know if you realised but this sub is more toxic than retail ever was/is, you included. You're scared about a non issue in early days which is being thouroughly tested to make it work as it should, with very limited possiblities for layer hopping.
---
The majority of the playerbase WILL not be 60 in the first week.
---
This is not a discussion, this just another post complaining about things that have already been explained and that are in development, you just don't understand them and so can't help yourself but complain because it isn't what YOU like, it's always all about YOU.
---
Well this is one thing they can do once Naxx is cleared or between big patches. Open up new servers with different kind of restrictions that create new metas.
---
For example level restrictions like beta right. Maybe just certain zones availble. No trading with other players etc.
---
That is also true.
---
I just go monkeynews/standard 2h arms PvP spec whilst levelling as it is vastly superior to fury.
---
Fury can’t sit crit proc enrage on classic.
---
I don’t start with sword and board in pve. I switch to it if I am jumped until I have control + disarm down.
---
Wouldn't that mean that taurens are too small on the private servers?
---
the clip has no nameplates on at all though. You would have seen them in vanilla or now with nameplates on. I don't really see your point unless you're advocating for no nameplates at all
---
Probably a silly thought, but imagine if the 1.12 reference client server is bugged too with things that wasn't in Vanilla...
---
Patch hit today and made a ton of changes. It seems like the rep decay has indeed been enabled so you now do no longer get full rep.
---

I'd say it's not only the fault to flying mounts. I'm a cata player, and discovered wow worlds just like you did, by feets. I remember, yet the modern version of desolace, thousand needles, just like you did. Back then. Also using a mount is not obligatory. The only thing that tarnished the experience of a leveling character nowadays is just the ambient easiness of things. I can't even say I know what is dungeon low level. You go thougt them as a hot knife in butter nowadays.
---
BTW great threat is generated by demo and battle shout. A single demo shout usually generates more threat than a t clap.
---
it's not entirely unfeasible since he did a reupload a month ago of his first video, but at the same time... i'd be very skeptical.
---
Yes you could. It's not possible on private servers for some reason but in vanilla you could.
---
I clearly remember why they brought in cross realm BG. Queue times were to long and premades ruled the server.
---
The southsea pirate area in Tanaris was like this too.  I used to use it as a grinding area when I got bored of questing.
---
Tbc had more wpvp then vanilla ever had. Daily quest hubs. Dedicated buffs and pvp objectives in the zones while grinding/levelling. Choke points to almost every raid instance to funnel ppl in. Only thing tbc had against wpvp was arena and arena gear
---
What does leatrix do?
---
Rip FF7 remake.
---
Not a fan of those action oriented battle systems. I liked it in 2007 on Devil May Cry. But not for an rpg. Especially one as cherished and sacred as ff7.
---
Would you personally bring a level 50 warrior? No? Why then you would you bring a ret paladin who adds *nothing* to the raid all while soaking up Onslaugh girdle, BRE and other melee items which you could use when you eventually bench the ret to progress on Sapph or Kel'Thuzad. Then the raidlead would wish their warriors would be better geared to squeeze out the remaining 3% on kel.
---
#B I G T R U E
---
Oh right, I love that you know where I mean:p
---
If you want feral pvp thatll more closely match phase 1/2 you want NEVER.
---
It also has some of the best editing for those days.
---
https://youtu.be/J7DN_w0LQUI
---
https://youtu.be/0jmxnDK_DB8
---
I raided and PVP'd feral back in the day and the way you fight and gear at different gear levels is completely different. Most of the videos mentioned are high rank pvp or AQ40+ geared which isnt very realistic of what most people will achieve. Primary difference is youll need to mix healing and feral gear before AQ40 or R13/14 gear to get enough mana to sustain shifting, which means burst dmg is much lower and you'll be looking to outlast equal geared opponents more often than not.
---
asmon is such a kill stealer lol. hanging around just waiting to execute.
---
There are no longer official data so no one can know for sure. Based on armory crawlers, addons and some statistical analysis, much more knowledgeable guys were able to extrapolate some estimations of sub numbers based on characters created and concurrent characters logged. And their estimates if i remember correctly were 1.7 to 2.5 mill for eu/us (i.e. China excluded) Note: I may have remembered the numbers wrong.
---
all i'd want in Classic (right now) is the barber shop because i'm completely undecided on what hair style i want for my character... and i also like changing hair styles/colors.
---
I grouped up with a random level 35 rogue today for like 2+ hours. In dustwallow marsh, then headed to stv. Had so much fun. We ran around and quested, killed some horde, interacted with each other like human beings are meant to. It was awesome. I've had more fun in the last week off retail than I have in the last 10 years ON retail.
---
Probably slightly/significantly better than it can bfa BFA
---
r/classicwowplus  
---
:)
---
Nostalgia
---
Sadly that's just what we have to deal with. It's a deal I'm willing to make though. The only reference client they had was from. 1.12.1 apparently.
---
Give this man an Oscar!
---
It's another way around. BFA is looking pretty but empty inside, like all human girls.
---
Yeah that's an interesting point, I wonder if we'll see some changes once the level cap is set to 60 and people get to beta test the raids.
---
the two things that made flying in TBC fine was that first you needed to earn the flying even the basic flying amount was not an assured thing you got, it was its own content you did to earn.
---
and secoundly the only part in the world where you could fly was outland and lots of content was still locked behind ground mounts.
---
as for WotLK flying to me was great since they designed zones around you flying while also sticking a gigantic no flying zone in the middle of the world made flying more interactive.
---
We already have a fair bit of space to play with on classic, some of the zones could easily extend outwards a little, dungeons added to areas / use those that already exist but never got added.
---
Not heard that song, since Jackass.
---
If you manage to find guilds who don't raid the same time slots , sure. Seems like most guilds raid night after reset though.
---
And to add to that that paladin has soaked up 6-9months of MC + Ony gear and now needs  to be cut. Now you lost out on a lot of non tier DPS gear.
---
If you dont like the game they make *don't play it*
---
Vast majority?  I don't know about that.  I was always terrible with money and even I had fast flying a few months after TBC launched.
---
Gold drops were significantly increased.
---
Same here, I'm 51 and I'll be playing as much as my body can take, that's still quite a lot :)
---
Classic HAS to become a timeline split and they really have to listen to the community for new content to work. It's great that they are doing Classic but they can't sit on a EoL patch forever and going forward with TBC just opens up a can of worms. Best case scenario we get "WoW 2" with this and they stick to what made WoW great and never add any of the cross realm stuff to the game and really think about what QoL changes should be added while consulting the people that are actually dedicated to Classic.
---
bruh this shit racis tho FR
---
Exactly. They killed Azeroth, essentially. The moment you could jump into a dungeon, any world questing went out the window... and I give kudos for trying to revive it by adding new quests and changing things like The Barrens, but with the addition of heirlooms, it basically negated having to do any world quests. Really sad because some of those places like desolace or my favorite, Felwood and Winterspring were forever ignored. They put a lot of effort into content people didn't care about. I'm being optimistic about Classic.
---
600 pulls, 9 hours a week, somehow killing it before any nerfs? Okay, which guild was it?
---
&gt;Were you in a guild that downed it pre-nerf... or at all during progression?
---
Um... yep. https://raider.io/characters/us/Malganis/Nolr
---
TRUE
---
Level 40 power spike on my hunter was fucking *insane*. Mail armor, new abilities, Bestial Wrath 31pt talent, etc. My damage went up like 30% and I got a mount, better traps, etc. Also got the Sword Of Serenity and Vanquishers sword.
---
They will cash in when people return subscribe to their service and play again (people have been unsubbed since BC)
---
But if they existed back then then they should be in the 1.12 reference code right? So classic should have them?
---
I never understood the belief that flying mounts killed wpvp. Wpvp was dead long before tbc. It started to die when bgs was added and was really dead by 1.12 when cross realm bgs arrived. There was no longer any incentive to do wpvp. Tbc actually made it better in many respects. But still if you want wpvp you will have to add incentive. I can almost guarantee that wpvp will die in phase 3 in classic for the same reason whit a slight uptake for aq event and then be just as dead again
---
Wait, bears?
---
Oh my god, thank your for posting this video man! It was the first pvp video I ever watched and for the LIFE of me I couldn't ever find it again after some years (Seems like I didn't come up with searching "WoW Gnome mage pvp", lol). You're a hero, may your day be filled with whatever makes your day, friend.
---
It is what it is. You cant tell me Monkeynews playing 11-16hours a day all day every day without eating isnt neackbeardy.
---
How come no one posted this yet?
---
The best place for guilds: https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
(It's in the sidebar too.)
---
Agreed, new content would be great but needs to be in the old continents. Adding modified expansion content and new continents will make the old world and main cities ghost towns (again), which destroys the classic charm.
---
[Not exactly the same, but it's my favorite alternative.](https://xpoff.com/)
---
Lol
---
I DONT CARE IF IM THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THIS WAY. I'M OBJECTIVELY RIGHT AND ONLY MY VIEWPOINT IS VALID. PLUS BLIZZARD IS MAKING THIS GAME FOR *ME*.
---
Looking at his comment history he is just an overall sad sack of pretentious shit.
---
I have never seen that, cool.
---
Its not only this sub, friend.
---
Welcome to the human condition.
---
I can smell the musk through the picture
---
It is their right to play the way they want but lets be real, we have already seen it in the past, ppl will take the easy route and then complain that things have changed or its not like It was etcetc.
---
So no changes is perfectly good for classic wow but throw that to the wind when the other versions of the game comes out?
---
Just do more dps 4Head
---
damn straight! I am gonna start an OG guild up when it launches :P
---
At least on my realm epic flying was rare and a real accomplishment.
---
So funny he is clicking his pom pyro combo.
---
u mad bro?
---
J. Allen Brack didn’t do shit btw, he made fun of people wanting Classic then was slapped on the wrist and forced to take it back once Blizzard realized they fucked up.
---
r/classicwowplus   
---
The point is, you would see them from far distance, ruining the sense of surprise and hiding behind texture. I often found myself hiding from some hordie groups in STV, avoiding them while leveling. This would not be possible if they saw me through textures thanks to 80 yard nameplates
---
I would love to see a TBC without flying mounts.
---
Dont think you will hit nowhere near close to 144fps with an integrated intel chip. On private servers i hit 144fps with a i7-7700k and a gtx 1080, and it usually dipped belowed that a lot of times.
---
I remember being feared and polymorphed through that window, so something was always wonky about the way it works as a wall.
---
ye that was sort of a pipe dream for me. Do you think I'll be around 60 tho?
---
Well, the idea is to keep further iterations of WoW feeling like the original WoW. So, yes, there would be no changes to the base game, and changes to further iterations to keep more of the base game feeling.
---
That's because it #nochangesexceptstuffidontlike
---
Yeah, at least on low settings you probably will.
---
although several areas arent accessible without flying iirc (elemental plateau in nagrand?)
---
Why some people like old cars and how they look instead of new ones?
---
It's all of phase 1 not just for launch. That means months , first tier of raiding.
---
This and the Shimmering Flats are just amazing and are partly why I love the 30-40 levelling bracket so much.
---
I rly don‘t care for it. You also can do anlvl 29 pvp twink. Same shit 🤷🏻‍♂️ don‘t focus too much on beta. Wait for the real deal and enjoy it!
---
All the 40 "players" with proper lighting and particle effects. We can only look at it since the models are property of blizzard, maybe I can make it so that people can run around by themselves but that is it.
---
Speed isn't even the issue with Flying mounts. The flaw with Flying is that it effectively places you in a personal instance where the only interactions you can have with other players is via chat.
---
Possible, but I'd assume it's fairly accurate. Tauren have trouble with certain doorways so it'd be more obvious that there is an issue if those no longer existed.
---
Same thing happened to me on a 40 man raid to Durotar. I got split from the group and was making my way to them when I got blasted by a level 12 mage. Apparently when he encountered the bulk of the group, he was like a raid boss for them. Wish I could have seen it. Shortly after, we all disconnected, then immidiatly relogged and we were back in the level 5 world.
---
Picture them dealing 10 times more dps, the boss would still take 2 hours per attempt
---
&gt; I love Esfand, I love Staysafe, I love Kargoz, I love TipsOut, 
---
this doesnt sit well with the rest of this toxic sub :D
---
you incels are too toxic omigosh who hurt you just let them shard the game for a bit lol who cares we are BFA I mean classic fans too lol this sub is toxic
---
Yeah, as I mentioned, I think some zones/areas would require remodeling to make ground mounts more accessible.
---
There are clips of people on beta relogging next to mining nodes to switch layers so they can get the same node on a different layer.
---
Yeah I'm mad. I'm fucking tired of every 6 threads being bitchfits about an unfinished feature that we have very little information about. This sub used to be fun, since the beta its just a bunch of bitching and moaning about layering killing classic.
---
Well, I think it would be interesting to try no flying mounts at all, but that may have been too extreme of a suggestion. 60% definitely feels like crap when you're used to 100% ground mounts, so I figured that people would be incentivized only to use flying mounts when something is a pain to reach vertically, rather than horizontally.
---
Then you didn't play vanilla at release. Forced PvP objectives and zones i don't consider real wpvp. Also everything involving flying mounts is not real wpvp and should be killed with fire.
---
The term your using in the way you’re using it is going to confuse a lot of people.
---
Content is being added in the sequence it was added into the game. Those are the “phases” Blizzard is talking about.  
---
Battlegrounds were not in the early game. They were added sometime halfway through vanilla, along with the honor system. That’s how it was then, and that’s how it’ll be now.
---
Yes!
---
As far as I know, no, there is no way. That's why I reported the discrepancies as bugs. I have no beta access so just here in the bug thread.
---
The glow effect was in Vanilla too, however it was more subdued. So you can choose between overblown glow or no glow.
---
Similarly in Vanilla the FOV (field of view) was narrower on widescreen monitors. It can't be set in Classic.
---
My ping is only 115 to NA on modern wow. So probably just gonna do that. (In Japan)
---
Well aren't you a little snowflake.
---
I had to capture and train the pidgeons first.
---
Maybe they should inform us better then. There should have been a lengthy blue post explaining layering in detail weeks ago.
---
I dont know how much this matters in your case, but in comparing pservers and classic, my computer ran the stress test much better than pservers, without any dips i experience on pserver. I think comparing it to retail wow, and assuming it will run slightly better, is more accurate.
---
Pls stop crying
---
Reason for not using it back then was framerate issues.
---
That is a druid bear tank, or it is supposed to be. I could not find the model for the original, I will keep looking.
---
No prob! I ended up making a small guide out of this, and added my dagger lists which I converted into google docs:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bss8ef/dagger_rogue_guide_leveling_talents_and_dagger/
---
Well because that's how it was back then? Southshore vs. Tarren Mill happened because there was no battlegrounds or organized PvP so people had to make it themselves, and world PvP will be nuts in phase 2.
---
I dont think warrior is that hard to gear,  they get most of the plate loot (paladins wear a lot of cloth/leather for healing)  
---
Some slots are awful to grind out (like the hand of justice trinket in brd) but other every class has some gearing milestones imo.
---
Early WoW also ran on AT&amp;T
---
pservers are not vanilla sources though.
---
Stop.
---
sorry, just woke up and seem to have missed it! :)
---
You can't seem to understand that aesthetic is subjective? Come on.
---
Right, I get that. I'm just confused as to why time-gating that content is necessary? Is it just to re-establish the exact feel of vanilla from 1.12 on?
---
Because while I'm onboard with the "no changes" crowd for the most part. It just seems silly to hold back one of best additions, simply because it came later, I guess?
---
Maybe world pvp will be more poppin without BGs, so that's at least something to look forward to.
---
I don't trust *Activision* Blizzard at all.
---
&gt;  to get a similar vanilla feel
---
reference videos from vanilla prove you wrong.
---
But why does everyone keep telling me that only 10% will be properly geared? Is it to scare new players off?
---
&gt;/console cameradistancemaxfactor 4
---
ahahahhaahah same here!!!
---
"forced PvP objectives" they weren't forced at all. The control points in Hellfire were fun points of contention when bc First dropped. 
---
Not everything that's new is bad.
---
If you are willing to tank, you will have a good time. If you are dps you will have to craft expensive gear like devilsaur and lionheart und farm you weapons. Eighter ironfoe and the dal'rend swords are a pain in the ass to farm. But every class has its "hard to get items".
---
Not that difficult, now that I know how it all works. I might do some renders later with different gear, why not.
---
There was where I found all of these.
---
i need this as a wallpaper.
---
You know when I knew there would be cross realm BGs? When they said there would be cross realm BGs. This isn't a surprise to anyone right now.
---
Why is this not surprising?
---
&gt;Putting presentation logic in the backend of a frontend-heavy application is bad practice.
---
It's not. Yours sincerely a developer.
---
Didn't Decursive get nerfed before BWL even launched?
---
I can confirm she runs like a dream on my base model 2017 MacBook Pro.
---
I was kind of worried too that Mac may not support the game that well but much like retail everything is good.
---
I can play BFA on Medium settings no problem and Classic seemed to be okay maxed settings even with everyone running around but I’m sure when raiding/mass PvP becomes more relevant all of those spell effects are going to bring things down a bit.
---
Overall, won’t be an issue.
---
Flying mounts are the exact opposite of everything vanilla stands for. That was the major change that started the decline of the game. They are at least as damaging for the game as LFG.
---
I think of qol changes as things like customisable hotbars. Being able to re-bind keys. Not things that drastically change the game.
---
It's going to be huge for that first week. After that point, who knows.
---
Imagine if they really do this. It would decimate servers. Terrible Idea
---
All good.
---
So you'd rather the guarantee of stagnation and the death of the game over the chance that it might go well and have it keep being played for years? That really doesn't follow logically.
---
You press the button that says "undo Delete"
---
Is bis pvp and pve gear the same?
---
when it comes to expansions and changing TBC and WotLK. when it comes to TBC just due to how it was made very little change actually needs to be made since it really was a vanilla patch that became an expansion and with patches it ended up as a smoothend vanilla experiance which to me was still great.
---
however WotLK is where changes would really need to be made to get the experiance people remember and want. first of LFG should never be a thing in WotLK even when it was added it simply ruined server community and along with that all the cross realm dungeoning etc. they would also need to adjust the ilvl gap since the ToGC patch really did a number on WotLK by making it the only content that mattered. (it was not fun going from working on hard mode ulduar bosses to clearing ToGC 4/5 at week 3 and then having nothing to do the rest of the week)
---
with that said i would personally like to see a rotation of classic, TBC and WotLK servers where every 2 (3?) years this is rotated and at the end you can pick if your character is dumped into the forever classic/TBC/WotLK server or the expantion server.
---
i would then like to see somthing along the lines of classic+ if any of you have play old school runescape and how that changed that is more what i am thinking but with a aggesive stance to back step if thing go to far in the casual way making things easier. one example that is not making thing simpler would be retail WoW is working on a new AH putting that in classic would not be easier just a better working AH. but it would be agenst #nochanges and there fore classic+
---
People will mostly be raid logging anyway.
---
Lots of truth to this. It's a bummer that you have to be so "extreme" to garner a large viewership but it's hard to feel sorry for any streamer getting stream sniped in an open world pvp game.
---
I could be wrong, but I think only the scummiest of scums would camp someone like... Brian Kibler, who laughs when he gets beat and never gets tilted (granted this is all on hearthstone).
---
I mean... if Hitler or bin Laden or Bundy streamed their exact locations at all times, I think folks would have taken advantage. ;)
---
This. World PVP would be diminished greatly if BGs were to be out from the get go.
---
They should have been a lot more restrictive with flying.
---
It should have been a tool for reaching cool areas, like Tempest Keep or some mountain top areas.
---
But making it the generally best way to travel and available anywhere was a huge mistake.
---
Imagine caring about what streamers are supposed to be allowed to do and what not.
---
I mean it's just a part of the game and the nostalgia
---
Seriously, level syncing is something more MMOs should really look into. So much content becomes irrelevant it makes me sad...
---
Im starting to understand why teachers hate Wikipedia.
---
Ermahgerd #nochengers!
---
Oh, yeah?
---
I didn't had a keyboard so I had to use mouse only and I loved that way!
---
Yeah I'm disappointed I missed the stress tests as well. Seems fun with the GMs messing around and what not. I don't want to drop a sub for a small chance at beta though.
---
I had planned to take launch day off but I'm now considering just the Thursday &amp; Friday. That first day is going to be pretty mental.
---
Post-Naxx for life. No BC, no flying.
---
Neat ;)
---
That’s not true at all.
---
That's so good to hear
---
The girl on the right is guaranteed to lick yer booty hole while the one on the left won't touch ya except for special occasions
---
I understand your position and your fears, but this is going even beyond #nochanges (which is in fact, you could argue, #changes). And the magic you are describing will wear off in BGs rather quickly (imo). I would just say to you: keep the magic alive on your own server by making wPvP fun. Organize raids, get involved, make things happen.
---
no you are not, we have a post about this evert single day
---
Agreed, there’s no need. Extra flight paths would cover everything that required the flying mount.
---
Can be*
---
(Simply spamming shadowbolt is not more interesting than simply spamming frostbolt and/or fireball)
---
Blizzard wants to encourage world PvP by having BGs later on but also with the introduction of BGs players will have access to honor gear which overshadows some of the PvE gear from the earlier raids.
---
The Legion and the Old Gods have been around for millenia. They can handle being side-tracked for another game or two.
---
Or just make them playable factions in Warcraft 4.

Almost everything in BfA is darker and more serious than Classic. Have you done an honest comparison, or are you just repeating shit someone said without actually thinking for yourself?

People keep calling BfA "Disney". Find me a Disney movie with something as fucked up as that in it. Look at the cuts all over the legs, it's like something out of Left for Dead.

It’s the closest thing we have though.

Only half of your gear will be plate at the earlier phases though.

It's more common to see reactions like this, from people that decided to spend their whole life on hate. Both sides of this SJW/Incel debacle is a huge waste of time and energy. Alot of people will realize this when they grow up.
---
I'm lost.
---
Whatever man. It's not cheaper to develop a new server technology but sure. 
---
This technology is to *prevent* blizzard from having to merge servers down the line.
---
It's also to keep server populations effectively stable, because before a server gets merged its pretty dead and nothing kills mmos faster than dead servers.
---
BUT! Because blizzard only made this game *just for you* we'll remove layering. Hope you enjoy 5 hour que times. Oh and I hope you picked the right server. Wouldn't want yours to be dead 6 months after release when the tourists are gone.
---
I am, you toxic fuck
---
So, void elves, pandas and (lightforged) draenei in classic? I'll pass.
---
it is racist
---
Just make sure to be 60 by then. People between 48-59 are gonna have a bad time :)
---
They went for a scary look and failed due to the cartoonish skin and figure of the model.
---
&gt; It is a piece of (super dope) classic WoW history that only the 1% get to experience first hand.
---
Sounds a lot like raiding (especially naxxramas) initially was. Glad to see people can sympathise with retail on here eventho they disagree with it.
---
Another day, another one of these posts.

---
Late question.
---
I've noticed that rep gains across classic wowhead are all at TBC or WotLK levels. Is that something that the client will fix or something needs to be manually adjusted?
---
Soooo..... 
---
Yes changes now?
---
The new models move and attack in a different way and it feels like shit. Biggest turn off for me with retail wow.
---
I think it used to scale if you had any speed effect.
---
(https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPexEfCG7g)[check 9:55] the charge speed seems to be pretty clearly higher when he's under the effects of the skull of impending doom.

It also matches my memory of the time but, as we have all discovered over the past few days your memory doesn't mean much!
---
Yup. Feels like playing a different game.
---
Payo is gold. The funniest shit is that everyone thinks he sucks in duels but he is actually quite good hah
---
Do you guys plan to offer that with the thottbot skin so we can perfectly describe Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape?
---
Dunno who downvoted you but this is a valid point.
---
The only problem with this theorycrafting is, finding items that give enough spell damage to drop a piece of gear with +hit. If you’re properly farming gear as a true min/maxer, you typically won’t have the sort of item jumps that allow you to drop a substandard piece with +hit for a much better piece with no +hit but enough Spell Damage to compensate for the lost hit.
---
Because raids only dropped 2 items per boss kill and there’s 40 people present*. 
---
*excluding ZG/AQ20
---
How do people come up with BiS items? Without ilevel and thousands of items, how do people filter them down to BiS?
---
Well you'd have to have #1 standings to be able to finish 13-&gt;14. You would only have to grind that much if people are also all doing that. I don't remember the specifics apart from being the top 1% for the week, as in if there's a certain minimum honour requirement.      
---
You'd really only have to grind that much if you're trying to rank outside of people colliding, or if several premades and tons of people are trying to force themselves down the rabbit hole imo.
---
How about you do work at work?
---
I believe he’s referring to Stamina&gt;Spirit for warlocks. All other dps stats are a much higher priority though, as you point out.
---
leveling assassination dagger rogue is a direct downgrade from combat daggers or combat swords
---
This is stupid. "Level 30 meta"... please, listen to yourself.
---
OK, here's my 2 cents:
---
1. In open world PvP both classes do well, but I find Mage better, because they can actually kite the melee classes and most of them lack gap closers. Not the case for locks, where they'll be expected to 'tank' damage, and a geared warrior can hit a clothie for ridiculous amounts of damage.
---
2. Soul shard farming can be a chore, but what is actually annoying is the lack of bag space. Typically for 5-mans and 10-mans you don't need to farm, if you generally keep your Soul Bag full. Raids will be a pain because you will be expected to provide 30+ healthstones, and also summon the slackers.
---
3. Keep in mind that in raids you will most likely sacrifice the pet, so in endgame PvE you will not really feel like a pet class. Obviously this does not apply to the open world.
---
4. When it comes to performance, mages will be overall better. Warlocks catch up in AQ40/Naxx gear, but earlier on a mage will typically have the advantage over a lock, especially since Warlocks don't have +Hit talents for Destruction spells.
---
However both classes are needed at endgame, and warlocks provide enough QoL to a raid to bring multiple. DPS is not all that bad either.
---
Yeah, my bad. I added a picture that's closer to the original POV to the album.
---
If you tank all your dungeons its the easiest class to gear before raids.
---
because 90% think you can get equivalent of R14 weapons by playing 2 hours per week at 60, most people simply underestimate the time investment that it takes.
---
Never liked that zone. But i do remember some open world pvp skirmishes at the rocket racing tracks that were quite fun. Which usually led to people fighting from there to gadgetzan where they agro the guards. Then of course as a mage i climb on top of the buildings and start nuking people down.
---
No it isn't, blizzard reference is, pserees being accurate is a lot of screenshot, post, video and media research done and compiled. It's a reference in terms of people played last, but a reference for how things really were.
---
there are no big options you have due to limited gear. i also never did pvp oder play DPS. for PvP you might need a little more HP.
---
Just what I said.. Gnomes ain't taller.

Once aq40 and naxx is there you need lots more gold for raiding. You will need those off days later on so most GMs will be against it.

Because i have alot of downtime at work and am allowed to play.

Stop trying to make Classic into a bastardized BfA. Go play BfA if you want new content.

Right, just speak for yourself and don't make sweeping statements about what people like and not :)

Nope it was a total dick move.

The newer model's aren't just HD updates, they're *new* models, and some of them just suck. Same with a lot of the animation.

I'll wait for more feedback like yours before implementing changes. The vast majority of legend related feedback has mention that it's a little confusing at first but quickly become second nature. Random drop and Escort quests tend do pop up very infrequently but checking the legend via keybind is a relatively painless solution to that.
---
Tablet devices are also quite popular but have a limited resolution that has to be taken into account. The legend isn't large by any means, but it's still content that doesn't need to be visible at all times.
---
Thanks for your feedback!

I think there are enough threads about it already. Ill post my screen again since this is still going

Personally, I'm content about witnessing this piece of history. Moreover, I'm more so appreciative about experiencing the demo and taking tons of screenshots, meaning I can when classic releases compare the past to the now.
---
Kul Tiras. I used to raid with a guild called Broken Empire for a while.
---
Play a pserver on a battlestation and people, being people, still fuck up simple things, making things harder than they have to be.

blizzard can see what addons players are using just fyi
---
I love it :)
---
We already knew this it isn't post worthy anymore this isn't your blog.
---
flying was limited in both TBC and WotLK. in TBC the only place you could fly was in outland which made the area more PvE like which was fine since a ton of content was still outside of outland.
---
and with WotLK they leaned into the PvE aspect of flying for the last zones for leveling while putting a gigantic no flying zone in the middle of the content for PvP which made flying less useful and not a clear A to B point flying at all times.
---
making you able to fly in the redone world in cata removed that World PvP space they could put stuff if that is what they wanted.
---
Honestly no idea. I'm pretty sure it would depend on how good yours is, and theirs. I don't think anyone can say a definitive amount, because there's nothing holding you back from playing 24/7 to take the first slot. Apart from being able to stomp more games compared to them and be able to play less.

there are even people that impersonate smaller people like verycoolguy constantly

And I rmemeber sitting around waiting for someone to take the point so I could take it back, no PvP involved.
---
Played vanilla since release and although one on one fights were about the same in TBC, there was definitely bigger group fights in vanilla.
---
They would probably be angry about it if they found out. No guild wants to give loot to ppl that dont commit.  You can get away with it as long as you keep a low profile and keep your mouth shut. Like if you keep wiping on a boss and keep giving "tips" because that is how your other guild does it. They might be suspicious.
---
Well, also, 1.12 talents and itemization are going to make the game easier.
---
normal guards are just like regular enemies, there are like 2 special guards in each city that can see you from far away even when you're invis, they net too but you can easily get out of it as a rogue
---
WoW set up lore and forshadowing for Deathwing, Cata was the end and the beginning
---
“World first”... I read this 2 words too Much. 
---
In vanilla we talked about world first by downing significant raid bosses and reach 60. Not doing a big... i find it a little too clickbait...
---
Maybe I should not care but I roll my eyes every time...
---
My bad. I realised there were some attempts at comparison, but my thought was getting a scene-for-scene recreation to make it easier to discern the difference the lack of scaling has.
---
In hindsight, probably wasn't a great idea. Apologies.
---
There aren't thousands of items for any given category. People just looks at the stats, and it's usually fairly obvious which one is BiS. For example, in Phase 1 of classic, there's only 4 epic daggers at 60, and their order of power is very clear.
---
For those struggling to open the console, here's a rough guide. 
---
To open the console you need to run the game with additional  command line arguments "-dev - console". You add these by going into your battle.net client, select options for the game (and variant), and look for the "additional command line arguments" checkbox. 
---
When you get in-game you then have to type this command in the chat:
---
/script SetConsoleKey("z")
---
Now you can hit Z to open the console. Obviously you can bind other keys, but I've found some keys to not work (e.g. ",").
---
Keep in mind that some commands are protected, meaning that only blizzard code may execute them. 
---
Also, take CAUTION: do not execute random scripts from the internet without reading and understanding them. There are malicious scripts out there that can alter your character and inventory significantly.
---
riposte is almost broken
---
If you look at his right ear in the first and the second picture you can see the height difference pretty clearly, confirming the other theory that private servers had missed the scale modification and thus they appear smaller on pservers
---
Absolutely taken down.
---
they're never going to know if you're smart about it, battle.net friend lists might mess it up for you though so beware
---
These Guys hate everything that's new with passion. You won't get any reasonable answer here.
---
would be nice if they'd make a statement on how they plan to counter layer hopping.
---
Vael probably could in early gear.
---
That's it boys, pack up the beta, Blizzard has it all covered.
---
I could have sword some of the nameplate addons extended the distance you could see them in vanilla
---
There's pservers, classic, retail and retail vanilla init
---
Ironforge is the best Alliance city
---
Yeah but world first bg... why not world first grey loot and world first lvl 2. I mean let’s keep the world first for serious stuff, like lvl 60, c’thun, KT, Ragnaros, nefarian, rank 14
---
the skilled blade is preraid bis, right?
---
It's not only flying. It's also that the whole continent is designed for high level players. The max level characters are completly separated from the small folks and that removes a lot of tention on PvP servers. Plus TBC basically removed ALL old content. It didn't add nearly as much as it took away.
---
I raided with a guy who did something like this, in between wipes he would do push ups.
---
40 man raiding is a pain in the arse. The fights are very simple in MC/BWL and only a little bit more complicated in AQ/Naxx but 40 people is just a headache. There are very good odds out of the 40 people, a couple will be falling asleep or having internet problems or have to leave halfway through. You have trash respawns and have to hearth for repairs and people are always running out of reagents and consumables.  
---
So yeah mechanically, vanilla is not an issue. All the pve content is very straightforward and there isn't even any serious pvp content worth organising around except bragging rights. However 40 man raiding brings with itself a whole lot of issues that if you're not prepared for can really screw you over, and makes casual raiding very difficult. You won't have random crappy guilds and PUG groups blundering their way through clearing C'thun and clearing Naxx. No matter how geared they are.
---
The gnome height debacle is the funniest shit that has happened to this subreddit
---
Okay you have to be trolling.
---
People are mostly just running dungeons and capping tradeskills on the PvE beta server lol. Tons of SM runs and people selling good crafted gear etc.
---
Outside of that, everyones leveling alts to the level cap too on their second class, with a few folks spamming looking for dps/healers for their pvp groups.
---
I guess what Im saying, is you aren't missing all that much.
---
"Forcing" is the key word here. Forcing people to engage with the world and its inhabitants at all times (not only at destination) definitely translates to more engagement :) Fun and engagement are different things. And you or anyone else can't tell what is fun or is not fun, its personal.
---
Obstacle -&gt; engagement -&gt; fun. Not the other way around.
---
Lol most wow players knew it was scrpited.... DI the mages!!!
---
I could've sworn they said it'd be in off the bat once BG's release
---
Classic WoW, both PvE and PvP content, is easier than retail WoW. That’s just a fact. People confuse tedium, bugginess, and poor design as difficulty. 
---
Put it this way: Pieces, on retail, had around 650~ wipes before getting their world first Uunat kill. Here’s a dirty little secret, that 1 wipe count will never be reached by any guild when classic goes live if they’re playing with raiders who understand the difference between strafing and back-peddling. 
---
This isn’t to say classic isn’t fun, it is fun. Part of the fun is that it’s so damn easy that you don’t have to think, you don’t have to be mindful about your situation and player agency, both in PvE and PvP, is significantly less.
---
I think most guilds disbanded before they hit 500 wipes on vael
---
Get a laptop?
---
As an SM/Ruin build (deep affliction essentially) you should also be given a debuff slot for Corruption, to fish for Nightfall procs. If your RL does not give you the slot, then yes you are relegated to DS/Ruin and Shadowbolt spam.
---
The major difference with mages is managing your debuffs (Curse + Improved Shadowbolt) and your threat generation.
---
Not very hard at all, you will get spots in dungeon and raid groups very easily as warrior.
---
Trust has to be earned. Look at the state of BfA and tell me that all will be right with an open classic. I prefer authentic Burning Crusade servers.
---
that ending lol
---
Central location in relation to the continent?
---
I probably will to an extent, as I don't really have alts.
---
We need more memes regarding these replies about parents belittling our hobby
---
Content is being added in exactly the same way it was added in vanilla, battlegrounds were not in the initial release, and they won’t be in Classic, either.
---
That’s just the way it is. Personally I think wpvp is far better and wasn’t a huge fan of battlegrounds and I’m glad we get a large break before they’re added.
---
Although the new models are technically superior, I think it'd degrade the overall look of classic with having the juxtaposition between new models with old everything else.
---
Is the reason why it stopped or that it was the go to in the first place?
---
PVE focus but on a PVP realm. Rolling warlock and i can't wait to start destroying people in AQ/Naxx gear.
---
Streamers have all said this term, not sure why you think this is stupid.
---
This guy got 1 shot by Seal of Command
---
When BWL is out the good guilds will be kitted out in gear from MC/Ony/DM. On top of that people actually know how to play the game somewhat optimally, that includes all buffs availble.
---
Lmao classic is not the game for you then. Off you pop.
---
For real? Flying still lead to great and valid PvP at times. The amount of epic battles I had over veins, and herbs were countless. If anything it was better because you had no prep time. Your just mining your own business when a warrior comes flying out of no where to jack your shit. That was just as fun as vanilla PvP, just not as often.
---
My bank alts always had a full suit on. Need to find some kind of pimp staff as well.
---
Gnomegate.
---
The go to. Once BC came in, you could portal out of Shattrath to Major cities, and most end game content was in outlands.
---
Better to test everything even if turns out to be a false positive instead of doing nothing and hoping for the best. Pservers are all we have other than 15 year old memories and 480p (at best) videos. After all, we dont have access to their vanilla client to test things ourselves.
---
Only graphics will change in Wc3. Not the mechanics at all, from what they said.
---
WoW was the most accessible and casual MMO of its time.  For early raids, the hardest part will be getting 40 people to show up on a regular schedule for the majority of guilds.  Of course, some aspects of Vanilla are very very difficult.  But, holistically the game has always been intended to deter casuals, and in fact was built for them.
---
Can't really only raid log in vanilla. Unless you have gold out the wazoo to buy mats.
---
Here's how I blew from 40 to 60 in vanilla: Deep affliction, get Dark Pact with an Imp out in perma phase shift, run around dotting everything in sight and drain tanking the last few % of health from mobs that reached me. Not heaving to sacrifice life to get mana back meant I had to Drain-tank less, and usually Siphon Life on 2-3 mobs was enough to keep me going from pack to pack. Absolutely faceroll for anything non-elite.
---
god damn 1%. i call for gaming socialism!!11
---
Its closer to menethil harbor that takes you to kalimdor as i understood it. I always prefered stormwind because i thought it looked nicer.
---
Try the tauren girls. They are a bit rough though.
---
Or because beta was just released and bfa wasn't?
---
What a retarded post.
---
I'm fairly sure I saw the AWS show up while using google services.
---
I agree. As long as the core design elements are maintained then why not? Things like making more class specs viable and maybe even finishing vanilla Hyjal would be nice.
---
Depends on the amount of Wrath-people that join classic. Wrath-people will choose Stormwind and then ask why there is no Stormwind harbor.
---
At least someone likes you :(
---
Which is a good thing? Leveling is 90% of the game content.
---
And Orgrimmar will be the Horde hub... so the best city raids will happen in IF/OG.
---
Good luck with vael
---
Flying is like a candy bar. It tastes good, you want it, it seems great. The thing is though, they aren't good for you, they are basically pure sugar. If you keep reaching for candy bars every meal, you are going to start feeling like shit, your blood sugar will be fucked up, you're gonna get fat, diabetes etc. in the game that is to say, you are going to get bored, tired of playing since you finish everything too fast etc.
---
Now that we know candy bars exist, we are always going to want them. Even if all the candy bars are removed and gone, we will still wish to taste them even though we know how bad they are. The best thing they can do is to just keep flying out of the game going forward, like he said. If they make TBC, Wrath etc. just deviate from retail and keep it 'classic-like' instead. We may WANT flying, it may feel good, but we will actually feel better and the game will be healthier overall without it.
---
Skilled Blade is the best easy to obtain off-hand. But Bonescraper is probably better.

We are talking when Naxx is on farm and people are moving toward being full BiS. By that point you don't need much more than a couple resistance/mana pots.

---
Looks like the shield is being warped by some perspective effect
---
Are you using any displacement type lens?
---
Fall behind, speed ahead, outlevel? Damn man take a breath and enjoy the game, ain't no sprint
---
Probably because it's not really relevant content any more. You have a half dozen expansions on top, and only the latest one is relevant. 
---
If you make the entire levelling process NOW like it was in vanilla TBC nobody (relatively) would ever reach max level or level an alt really.
---
1-60 was pretty rough even back then in terms of time. Doing that but for 1-120...
---
Agreed, very excited!  Just wish low level PvP from the start would at least be incentivized in some way.  Maybe there will be a lot anyway.
---
Molten Core drops all of the pieces.

If you take your time it is quite obtainable for even a more casual player.

Nostalgia hits me with full force...
---
i had felstriker and bonescraper when i had prebis on another server but bonescraper is very good to use for preraid bis, it isn't unique so just farm two if you want, +4 daggers is not too impactful as preraid bis and will get replaced fast if you are raiding as daggers, you'll get prio on core hound tooth and perdition's blade since most rogues play swords in pve (daggers are unfortunately inferior to swords in pve until you're substantially geared)
---
You killed a ?? at 34?
---
But you won't see beyond bwl.
---
Ironforge lost its "Hub" status when the Burning Crusade was released and Shattrath became the new Hub. 
---
When we returned to Azeroth in Cataclysm, Stormwind became the Hub for Alliance. I can't remember why, I think Stormwind was closer to something that was important.
---
... i dont want to?

I'm going mage for exactly that reason, good for PvE/PvP will same spec (ish)

This. If I'm looking for something for BfA I would just search WoW or more likely already have it bookmarked (Wowhead and the likes). If I'm searching for classic things I would actually type in classic/vanilla so Google specifically knows I'm looking for that info.

You're making a lot of presumptions about how layers are going to work

Because if BGs were present immediately on release, there would be little reason to World PvP and this would not replicate the original launch experience.

I didnt do much WSG at all once Alterac Valley was released to get r14. Our queue times were like 1-2hrs and god knows how long you will be stuck in WSG. It was rather like farming solo kills in AV the whole day for me, getting these 300-500 honor per kill. And if we had to do WSG later on, i used the waiting time for Silithus Sand farming. Good old days.

Of course it is. Especially from "classicbros". I remember around time nost got things hyped for classic (classic servers were all dead before it basically) you would just hear how difficult the game is and how retail is super easy.

Mage is good if you are ok with respecing for pvp/pve, otherwise warlock is great since you can raid/pvp as SM/Ruin.
---
Yeah it definitely depended on the item. Some stuff would respawn pretty fast, but that chest in Tiragarde Keep is real slow. It's a big deal deciding whether you're going to try to wait and go for the chest, or skip that quest. It's a lot of exp, but you could spend more time waiting around than it'd take to just grind that exp instead.
---
The multiple difficulties of raids kind of ruined the achievement of downing the bosses for me in modern WoW. Sure we might down Ragnaros finally, but there's a Heroic Ragnaros out there with way better loot so we only beat "easy mode" in my mind. Leaderboards, achievements and titles are very much a thing in modern WoW as well and are better left to that crowd.
---
Mage doesn’t have a spec that works in both pve and pvp.
---
Not exactly the same way, but in a similar enough way to keep the same feel.

Stormwind had the Shaman circle that would allow you to port between Cata zones.

Hunter and Warlock are the only dps classes that can play pve and pvp with the same spec.
---
Finally someone with some answers. Any place i should go to learn how to do so ? and would i need to make a a macro for spells?
---
I thought this many times. Old ones had friendly character and felt like actual fantasy forums. New ones are awful Starcraft style futurism which are even harder to navigate than the original.
---
You can’t recall.
---
Not a rogue main, but I did level one and did so as sub swords because I don't like daggers.  During that process I learned nothing about dagger play.  Lol
---
What makes hemo really bad for daggers?  On paper the idea of bonus static damage on fast hitting weapons sounds decent.  Is it weapon base damage that's the issue?  Would a sword and offhand dagger make it less garbage?
---
Ironforge ceased to be the main hub when Stormwind got an Auction House.
---
So most people that started before patch 1.9 will probably choose IF for nostalgia reasons.
---
you are right, it's not bad in the way that it just sucks but it's bad because it costs 5 combo points to get to that you normally wouldn't spend in a dagger build and it also scales based on attack speed, and daggers are fast so they don't benefit from it too much, 5 extra points in a dagger build would be so awesome lol, it's bad enough not being able to go prep/cold blood and not being able to get 2/2 dirty deeds, i'm not sure what other talents you would have to not take for it to be worth it
---
No you can make a new raid which requires Holy Resistance and another side raid that drop holy resistance and so people will farm the lower tier raid just for different gear but not necesarrily better gear. 
---
You could also give out some special abilities like the tranquilizer shot for hunters in MC. There is tons of stuff you can do without power creeping raid gear.
---
And not too far from zg tbf
---
downtime is cleanup time my friend.
---
Don't worry, Theramore people out there that like you then you know.
---
Not really orgrimmar is boring as fuck and undercity is awful.
---
it's because backstab is dagger only and is incredibly good
---
it's also because hemo scales based on weapon attack speed, it's the same as how warriors want slow weapons to hit harder, hemo works like that so you don't benefit as much from hemo with daggers as you do with swords
---
If you hate them so much why do you give them free content?
---
jij is cool
---
Turning the Badlands into the Wetlands, amirite?
---
nothing to clean up i work in a office overnight.
---
Haha, looked good man. I know most of us that played Vanilla in our teens probably have some videos that would make yours seem like a Spielberg film in comparison. We saw all these cool PvP videos with awesome music and crazy editing and thought to ourselves "How hard can it be?" Which then led to us making content that would make r/niceguys cringe. Right guys? Guys?
---
It's nonsense like this that will ensure i try to get on a non streamer server.
---
Thanks for the update - gives us all a bit of hope - i got in the stress test no beta for me though.
---
So I should probably cancel my trip to Germany then?
---
What do you think of going almost full combat, but still use daggers with ambush/backstabs?
---
Start in Combat Tree:
---
2/2 Imp. Sinister -&gt; 3/3 Imp. Gouge -&gt; 3/3 Imp. Backstab
---
Proceed into Assassination Tree: 2/2 Remorseless Attacks
---
Proceed into Subtlety Tree: 5/5 Opportunity
---
Proceed back into Combat Tree: 5/5 Precision -&gt; Endurance 2/2 -&gt; 5/5 Dual Wield Spec -&gt; 1/1 Blade Flurry 
---
Proceed back into Assassination Tree:
---
5/5 Malice -&gt; 2/2 Murder -&gt; 1/3 Imp. Slice -&gt; 5/5 Lethality
---
Proceed back into Combat Tree: 
---
4/5 Dagger Spec -&gt; 2/2 Weapon Expertise -&gt; 5/5 Dagger Spec -&gt; 2/3 Aggression -&gt; 1 Adrenaline Rush
---
Meanwhile I’ve been invited to the beta yet I can only see the offline stress test realm :/ (confirmed its a bug by buddy who works at blizzard and asked internally)
---
Yeah, I liked to call them snap, crackle and pop. Just need to watch out for this pack.
---
I’m really curious how well does ClassicCastbars works?
---
PvP.   
---
My Vanilla experience was on an RP server (as a kid, I initially misunderstood what playing on RP servers entailed) and that resulted in me learning and exploring the game without having to face enemy players; which I quickly grew to love as we entered Hellfire Peninsula and fought over the contested areas there.  
---
Pservers have also shown me how incredibly fun it is to play in hot zones like STV, a place where you get on with your tasks and complete your quests, all while keeping one eye on a player of the opposing faction as they do the same, knowing that all it takes is casting a single spell to start a faction war over who controls the Nesingwary camp.  
---
Plus, imagine the fun of contesting world bosses...
---
I especially didn't think they openly RP'd while doing it.
---
Any reason to believe they have accurate numbers? Extrapolating numbers can easily be wrong by a factor of 10 if your metrics are not well defined. Did they calculate numbers when Blizz still announced the official ones in order to evaluate their accuracy?   
---
To me these numbers may as well have been rolled if there is no good validation.
---
were playing the old riding system, not the pre-tbc 1.12.1. so we got (afaik) tigerriding, horseriding etc  
---
to OP: Wintersaber is very expensive if u see goldgrinding as an alternative time waste. Tiger needs an hour a day for MONTHS, i think every class can grind gold and buy an epic mount much faster.
---
Having a server community even helps your means to an end. If you recognise a healer that's great, you'll be able to bring them back when striving to complete the next content.
---
15 minutes please I’ll give you anything
---
Oof, you just cut BFA with a Thousand Needles
---
You are in for a serious treat!
---
Absolutely, there's a ton of noisy people that don't accept decisions as the lesser of two evils.  We're going to have to make concessions undeniably, but people should find comfort in Blizzard making smart decisions.
---
Nightportier at a hotel outside of city centrum. If I rush my chores I can prob play for 4-5 hours on an 8 hour shift.
---
False. My company uses on-promise servers and we have most of our infrastructure on AWS.
---
Are you sure? I haven't seen stuff indicating we're getting that.
---
You make a good point, but we should realize that implementing changes into Classic WoW while maintaining those pillars is not as easy as it sounds.
---
Almost everyone on this subreddit believes that Classic/Vanilla WoW should not be changed to become like retail. However, when you go into the specifics of "What are good changes?*"* \- many people have their own opinions. For example, some people think that flying mounts are ok, others think it ruins world PvP. Some people are fine with heroic raids/multiple raid difficulties while others are not. I personally prefer 25 man raids over the 40 man raids but I know there are those who disagree with me.
---
The point is that everyone has their own idea of what changes they would like in Classic. If Blizzard changes something, the community will be split - some will like it, others wont. Look at layering - how many angry reactions did we have when it was first announced? If Blizzard ever comes up with new content post-Naxx for Classic WoW, they will run the risk of introducing something that the community doesn't like and ends up ruining this second go-around for many folks. After all, retail WoW came about because Blizzard wanted to improve on Vanilla, expansion after expansion.
---
cause everyone has strong opinons about how 'hard' endgame was and that fury warrior required INSANE gear to actually deal okayish damage. We will see how the changed armor values will change physical boss dps, but warrior was always a REALLY strong dps, as long as you put a little bit effort in it.
---
Yeah, SM Ruin Warlock, Holy Paladin, or HotW Druid fit those rolls a lot better.
---
I think this is how it worked on retail vanilla.
---
Pservers have mob pathing all sorts of wrong
---
Servers running the game code are not the only bottlenecks. In fact, from experience, client-facing servers are rarely the bottleneck.
---
Feralas time, I am not a racist.   
---
But yeah, literally racist.
---
Interesting, is hunter strong in Classic?
---
The mount isn't the expensive part, but I see what you were getting at.
---
I remade my banker when the Worgen were introduced. The top hat really sold the look.
---
Yes, they stated the old riding system in several interviews.
---
I dont know if there was an epic riding back then though, does someone recall?
---
Information i got so far:
---
Race-specific Riding skill = 20g
---
60% Mount = 80g
---
Epic Mount = 1000g
---
is there a race-specific 100% riding skill i need to learn aswell?
---
Not an answer on your question, more a answer on my question.
---
But why no laptop? You only need a mouse, because the keyboard is already integrated in the laptop.
---
I don't know the req for WoW Classic, but a cheap laptop will do the trick, I think.
---
Yeah dude, looks good, especially for duo leveling, since you'll be making ample use of backstab. I approve.
---
That will not work. From what they said, layers are sticky. I.e. you will be assigned a layer for your account and your characters will always be put there.
---
Why are there so many idiots who think that raiding is the only thing that matters in wow
---
&gt;feralas time
---
fuck u mean?
---
It's wrong. 40man raids make you recruit constantly, which is a fun experience for your guild to have 1-2 new guys to riff with each week. It makes your community feel vibrant. You always have 10-20 people online doing stuff even on non raid nights, so guild chat is always going. And when 1-2 people miss the raid, the game isn't fucked for you.
---
In terms of end game content its probably gonna be more difficult forming a raid group with consistent members that show up. The end game content will be roughly the same difficulty however gearing up takes a lot longer so progression will be significantly slower. Mostly wont be as hard as they make out due to addons being a lot better and people having a much better idea.   
---
However the rest of the game will be a lot more difficult. Some classes just can't spam buttons e.g. Hunters need to wait for auto shots to go off. Due to mana issues they can't use high ranks of spells to often or at all.   
---
Leveling will be much harder. I actually remember having a sense of dread while leveling especially after pulling a bunch of Murloc's in Elewyn forest. Some of the harder zones like Eastern Plaguelands had elite mobs patrolling and pulling them was a death sentence. Their was also horrible quests that required you to follow an npc and people would just gank you near the end causing the quest to fail.   
---
Farming gold is also gonna be a big issue for a lot of people especially to get epic mount.
---
Because you buy in to the dogwistle hate about " SJW ruining gaming" like this very post is trying to stoke?
---
Ok sorry but I gotta call bullshit on this one. You had to have the internet to play wow back then too, iirc the game released without an offline mode. I know this cause I started playing the game very early on back then
---
Do you think its actually better/stronger than normal combat swords?
---
Cool, we aren’t talking about some random npc.  We are talking about character models which do look way more cartoony.
---
In pvp yes.
---
It was never changed
---
Only with a memory injection as it was limited by the client.
---
because i already have a mini pc setup thats the size of a novel book. i have monitors available at work and it probably wouldnt be that big of deal to use  a tkl wireless keyboard and wireless mouse but id like to give it a shot with a controller. I also do not like laptops at all from a technicall standpoint since i cant really replace parts readily.

I remember talking about this with friends in 2004 -- the troggs on that island in the middle of loch modan. We were leveling dwarfs there, and the respawn rate on the troggs was ridiculous - place was deadly. I don't know if it was dynamic respawn, or a bug, or what. I don't think it was like that later on. But they must have been experimenting with it at some point, at least.
---
Well yeah, this isn't the BFA recreation sub.
---
The best and worst thing about warrior is they have 3 great roles that all need different talents and gear sets for. So if you want to do even two of those be prepared for a lot of work. If you just stick solely with one role than yeah warriors are pretty straightforward.
---
I had an Addon in my default UI Pack since like BWL that does exactly that (maybe less max distance tho). So no need to fix, because it was possible in vanilla via Addons/API.
---
old models belong in the old world &amp; match it, the new ones make most sense staying where they are

Dated a Tauren once, she was really into Stranglethorn.

She was an engineer who loved to fool around with all of her Gadgetzan. One had fire stats on it.

A lot of streamers/testers say that the spell batching is not that correct that it used to be back then. This is a great example btw.
---
In a later expansion. I think Cata once RBG came to the game. Vanilla did not shows eneny flag carrier 100%
---
Fuck...imagine those same vanilla principals carrying over to the rest of the content. Scrap flying and get rid of the rank spells but keep everything else. That feeling of dangerous leveling in BC and wrath like vanilla would’ve been amazing. I’m not sure how they would pull it off due to your character getting more potent abilities but I’m sure they could figure it out.
---
you could make the same argument for LFD eh
---
Been on the list for one a year. Got invited May 23.

Feralas is a level 30-40 contested zone that houses Dire Maul. It also kinda sounds like for the last.

A classic WoW pun.

---
We’ve had the client for a week. You might want to check back in a couple of months. Barely any add on makers even have beta access yet.
---
Okay, those are good reasons.
---
But aren't you afraid that tagging mobs will be hard with a controller or do you have already something for that?
---
Still having the one ring on my bank alt but unused
---
The auction house will be in IF so yes
---
fuck i didnt think of that. Im on little to no sleep lol.
---
Can't say for sure, but my opinion is yes, for duo with a warrior.
---
Been doing that since I realized the game went to shit with all of these bad choices.  Now that we're back to vanilla, however...
---
I'm sure googling will give you the information you need, you just slap it all into a macro, 5x Sinister Strike - SnD - 5x Sinister Strike - Evi.
---
Flying mounts is the beggining of the end of wow.
---
Even devs realized that and all new expansions lack flight for the most of the time.
---
Chill dude, it was a joke because pservers are the best thing WE (the public) have. So since he dismissed them entirely, what's the point in us testing discrepancies? No one remembers all the precise and intricate details from 15 years ago. Videos were recorded in 480p at best back then for 99.9% of content so you can't even read anything, so all you have left are specific interactions that might have been recorded, but then you still have to find those old videos with those specific interactions. Lastly we have screenshots, which people typically took to celebrate great feats they made, so very few useful things there and 100% more difficult to find online.
---
At the end of the day, the only reliable source we have are the Blizzard Vanilla clients, which we don't have access to. Blizzard doesn't have time to do a bit for bit analysis of the game, hence the beta.
---
The best thing we can do is to find something we think is wrong, discuss it with our peers online, then if we come to the conclusion that we do indeed think it's a bug, we report it and let Blizzard make the final decision by checking their only accurate source.
---
Facts.
---
none of them know who you are they just know you're a premade from xxx server, you recognize an absolutely minuscule amount of people when the pool is 50,000 people, which should be entirely self evident

Shard bags were a thing. Or was it a BC thing ?
---
Very nice.

beware of respecs btw
---
Sounds like how it was in vanilla. I know so many people who rolled multiple alts before finally hitting 60 on one.
---
How about you mind your own business?
---
no hunter?
---
Can confirm it was the case in 2004. Might have been patched after, idk I switched faction and class in 2005.
---
Nice allround spec. I would prefer 5% crit for both weapons to 50% offhand damage. Also 3/5 master of deception and 2/3 initiative is better spend on parry and riposte.
---
I think I worded it poorly. I'm saying that cross realm bgs would be in automatically as soon as BG's release
---
If I remember correctly the addon exists since vanilla or at least tbc.
---
One I seen used that wow server pop site only and there calculated i think a bit over 2 mill.
---
Can they be very wrong, sure. But its the best we have and they all point around 2.x.
---
Yeah, that's the key distinction here.  There were simply more fights and BIGGER fights.
---
Orc warlocks best warlocks
---
Haters gonna hate. Small minority but loud and obnoxious.
---
Absolutely hits the nail on the head with how I feel about future content for Classic.
---
We're here for Vanilla WoW. The further we go down the expansion pipeline, the futher we just devolve into what will eventually become retail.
---
Ironforge on my server in Vanilla was because it was easier to fly to searing gorge and the mc/bwl from there. Also it having AH first impacted the balance from the beginning.
---
&gt; I wonder if people remember it as being difficult due to being young and inexperienced
---
I started at the end of TBC and remember dying a hell lot and stuff being very difficult.
---
Recently I tried a vanilla emulator, I did the same stuff and found it's quite easier than I remember it.
---
I was a total noob back then while I'm experienced now after more than 10 years on several MMOs, so I believe this is one of the reasons for sure, not the only one probably but still.
---
i can confirm, shards are still there
---
Dude, just no! Don‘t let august come fast. I have to write my master thesis and also and not less important i‘m becoming father mid august. So for my sake, let it be a long while. 
---
Just joking: one way another i won’t start playing classic until next year i guess. At least i don‘t have to worry about layers (hopefully) and the initial rush, which i‘m not eager to be a part of. I hope this august comes fast for you!
---
There were also some islands with a ton of potential. And screw the Worgen and make Gilneas a proper human kingdom.
---
Yeah, Markman works great too you're right.
---
 There are also some more casual options like Shadow Priest and Nightfall Enhance maybe.  Depends a lot on the guild.
---
Yeah patch 1.9
---
You can read about it [here](http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft/678633p1.html)
---
What the hell are you talking about?
---
This is something I forgot I wanted from classic.
---
Went to YouTube to like the video to show support
---
Warcraft 3 is an excellent example on just updated graphics but same overall experience.
---
Yes, and many of those people might not buy the game but would pay subscription. They've been on private servers for a decade and those are completely free.
---
Locks needs stamina, mages don't. A Stam Int piece is warlock gear. A Int Spi piece is Priest/Mage gear.
---
When +spell becomes a thing then it depends about the piece.
---
Dated a Blood Troll once. She gave Blood Hoof to the entire village. 
---
But damn did she know how to Felwood.  
---
Sadly, she said I was too young and dumped me... She was into Uldaman
---
I'm sorry I have no clue what that phrase is supposed to mean, I even looked it up.
---
FFXIV does it really well
---
TBC was good if you look at it in isolation. The problem was that it was not an expansion. It was a replacement. It made everything before it obsolete rather than gradually increasing the world and content.
---
Thanks, appreciate it.
---
nah mine all were crackhead gnome females
---
How it should be.
---
THATS RIGHT! CANNIBALIZE HIS CORPSE!!!!
---
This comment aged well
---
Pvp for sure. I always felt a little burnt out from questing and having a little fight every now and then would help me deal with that. It was pretty great when you were lvling at the same pace as someone else and kept running into them. Started a little rivalry.
---
holy pala interests me much but its a big problem until u get nice plate
---
Did you model the the orcs all by yourself or are there any model provided by Blizz?
---
TBC introduced the hellspawn that is known as dailies and flying...

Glad you liked it :)
---
Any banker without http://classicdb.ch/?spell=13890 was a noob in my book.
---
He started streaming? Have to give this legend a follow.
---
Eh maybe. I kinda wanna try something new. But I'll have to see how it goes. Still quite a bit of time till August to figure things out. Who knows.
---
Well.. I guess karma was a dwarf
---
Depends what you mean by "properly" and also what spec(s).
---
For a DPS warrior you need the Lionheart Helm and the Titanic Leggings. That's a lot of arcanite bars which isn't easy for a casual player. Unless you are mining/enchanting chances are you won't be able to make the bars yourself either which means even more cost.
---
All in all though, hard isn't the right word. Time consuming is.
---
It will take time to "properly" (pre BiS) a warrior. It will take even more time if you plan to have two sets of gear.
---
While this is true of any class though warriors scale harder than most with the gear, meaning the beginning part of acquiring gear for warriors is a little bit more on the painful side.
---
Wait wait, no Rammstein? :o
---
I don‘t know if it works on Philips Hue especially. 
---
But what you definitely can do is plug in a cable with LED lights in your pc, there are programs where you can config that it shows the colours of your monitor. Then you‘d have the same. 
---
Not from IT, but I hope it helps

Don't think they will do an open beta, have no need to besides the stress tests.
---
I played wow for so long but a lot of this is new to me. Is it only cosmetics or is there anything, that actually maked playing more efficient?

That's how you get a dead game unless you switch to having new servers that reprogress

 Money rewards for Max Level quest completion are far too high. I understand that the Stress Test was considering level 5 to be max level. I also understand that at max level, the experience gained is converted into money. Below I have 3 examples of the expected money compared to the actual reward to be made from being max level and completing a quest.
---
Examples:
---
Quest - A Peons Burden
---
Expected Reward - 60c
---
Actual Reward - 6s 60c
---
\_\_\_\_\_
---
Quest - Minshina's Skull
---
Expected Reward - 4s 65c
---
Actual Reward - 46s 50c
---
\_\_\_\_
---
Quest - Zalazane
---
Expected Reward - 5s 10c
---
Actual Reward - 51s 00c
---
From what I can see, I was gaining 10x the amount I should have been. I'm unsure as to if this is a bug specifically caused on the stress test because max level is lower than it should be, but if this was to make it into the official release at level 60, it would destroy the economy.

Some do.

There used to be talents which increased stealth during vanilla, tbc, etc. When they did away with talents they incorporated that into stealth movement and eventually buffed it so its pretty fast.

The world's never going to go back to pre 2000s gaming though. Like people are going to create sites, and databases containing information on how to do things whether you think it's going to end well, or poorly.
---
Same.  Loved the underwater music theme, the 3D environment, the seahorse you got to ride around super fast there, the quest story, the underwater caves and saving the big underwater creatures from parasitic old god minions inside them, etc. One of my favorite zones in WoW. 
---
I think people who don’t like Vash’jir will never like anything underwater. Vash’jir is about the best that can be done in a game like this.
---
Agreed. Kalimdor blends together less well, but has way more interesting zones. Although, I'll never not do the elwynn &gt; westfall &gt; Duskwood &gt; stanglethorn Vale juggernaut, with loch modan and wetlands sprinkled in as needed. I seem to remember that just leveling in the human zones didn't quite get you to the level cap of each. You either had to grind mobs or do a lot of dungeons.
---
High quality content. I like it.
---
If it's an open beta why would you need a beta key lol

Since the same client is used for both our stress test users and our normal beta users, the name in the Battle.net App has changed to “Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic .

If you're going to grind Winterspring rep on a slow mount I suggest you stick to killing furbolgs rather than running up and down the length of the map for the frost giants. I nearly went insane on a fast mount.
---
Hard to use ground targeted abilities there if you’re too far above the sea floor, but I don’t ever recalling that being game breaking. But maybe the classes I played there didn’t really need those abilities so much (Warrior and Druid mainly). Do you remember some that were especially problematic?

Easier to level. Playing them late game can be kinda annoying with the squishy pet, pet management, remembering to buy ammo as well as avoiding clipping your auto shot.

---
So you can get invited to the ultra secret open beta.
---
yeah when i was a nub in redridge i was wandering around and found burning steppes.  It was cool because i was super scared to go through those burned wooden gates into the dark ashen place... but at the same time the ground texture literally just changed from red to black almost instantly lol.  was a bit sudden
---
in most areas they made the zone changes look pretty nice though
---
Manual Crowd pummeler, not Haste exactly but close enough
---
Why is unreasonable to like one art style above another?
---
There are things I like about the new games that I'll miss in classic, but the new models and animation's aren't one of them.
---
ummm
---
It depends entirely on how much that other premade chooses to grind. IDK how many spots there'll be for r14 this time around, but the players on the top of the list of honor will determine it.
---
If the other premade has their bidder for r14 hit 2 mil honor, you would need 2 mil honor and 1 point to take the rank, assuming there's only 1 spot in the r14 bracket.
---
If hypothetically the competing premade had a top player with 10k honor, you'd need 10k +1.
---
Layering seems to just be sharding but on a larger scale and slightly less more cross realm transfers. I personally would rather have one cohesive realm where everyone on the realm belongs and stays there and just have dynamic respawns to some extent to Help with the population overload. My priority would be to maintain a single realm at all costs. Just my opinion.
---
He "left" WoW when it was getting insanely popular. Who knows why or if he was actually forcibly removed because who in their right mind would leave WoW by choice at that incredibly successful point in time. He went on to found a company that failed, and was *voted out of that company*. Voted out.
---
So yeah, very debatable. Maybe don't grovel at the feet of people you don't actually know.
---
You need to get your head all the way out of your ass my friend! There are entire chats of people who didn't know this was staged because they didn't pay attention to the dialogs specifically, they just see the preparation and this moron going in, cause they didn't play at that time so they don't know if people did this or that 12 years ago. So really calling em clowntards is just a dumb thing to do. Go ask somewhere else, you'll see, a lot of people were clueless about this and just enjoyed it without going into it.
---
Classic hardcore content is easier than retail.
---
Classic casual content is harder than retail.
---
No need to be rude. PvP is always fun regardless of class or spec.
---
And if you want to go there, while warlocks have more tools to use for PvP (most of which go forgotten in the moment), mages can be a much higher pace-of-play (i.e. “glass cannon”) in PvP, making them far more engaging and challenging than warlocks.
---
Better? Or am I now also an idiot for pointing out a different perspective, too?
---
I think the best way to do this would be to create a new divided environment though. Which some people might object to.
---
Leave a pure 1.12 space for those who want to endlessly run through the same content forever (or just stop playing after they get bored, which is the actual likely conclusion), but also keep a door open for a new environment where they could create new "alternate" servers with new content.
---
That's the cleanest method imo. It would allow people who want nothing to do with new content to abstain, and it would allow people that want to experience potential new content to do so.
---
I mean, everyone propably agrees with this, but none of this have any influence on Classic drop in popularity after launch.  
---
The hype for Classic is so huge that at the very least 70% of people that are going to play it arent even Classic target.  
---
I dont understand why people measure here that everyone that will try Classic out will aim to do all the content?  
---
Look at BfA. I know its a meme "you can do all bfa content in 2 weeks blablabla" but thats not true.  
---
People were leaving for maaaany other reasons and the ones who left because of lack of content didnt do that after just 2 weeks, otherwise they didnt do all the content.   
---
Its not the lack of content that drives people away from BfA, its all the systems that ruin various experiences.  
---
Now for Classic, i know streamers love Vanilla systems, but most people trying out this game will propably hate these.  
---
For some reason people think that "streamers playing it=successful game"
---
Dude, it was 12 years ago... People watching today might just say "oh well guess at the time people just did that", I wouldn't blame 'em...
---
Tauren m, hu m/f, gnomes, troll m, UD m, orc m/f... ugh, just all move too smoothly and unnatural.
---
Cool, the person I was responding to was talking about WoW in general. Fucking retards these days.
---
houston, we have a bruh moment
---
In WoW there are a lot of mouse glitches, I found fixes recently, but doing 180's used to be a pain cause the camera would jump further... Still more efficient to go through
---
Feels Badlands man
---
People usually say leveling is hard when in reality it's just a grind.. sure some quests are hard to solo but there will always be groups for the majorty of the player base who don't rush to 60...You just have to put in the time and effort.
---
If your coming from Live and mythic raid you won't find PvE challenging at all but playing PvP at high end can be a bit of a challenge if you know how to utilize trinkets etc.. makes 1v2/3 possible for some classes and you will def see the difference between an average player and someone who knows what they're doing.
---
I don’t think you can keep splitting the playerbase up forever, if they want BC and wotlk servers etc then there’s gonna be small pops.
---
As a no lifer who grinded to rank 14, cross realm BGs make me sad.
---
I played on a server where we outnumbered the opposing faction by a fair margin and we’d have 15 min queues for our bgs. I actually didn’t hate it, I’d go to other zones and PvP, go farm some mats or just chill until it popped.
---
Cross realm definitely effects the community feeling on a PvP server, once it was implemented we got instant queues but the feeling of going up against old foes was gone and it wasnt the same again after that.

Priceless, seriously, I thought it was gonna be straight up afk but that surprise was perfect

Everyone is going to be playing it so why not

Does someone know if addons like

AVR or   
---
RDX   
---
will work again?
---
Yes you should. WoW is the best MMO every made. So huge that it became a cultural phenomenon that even non gamers knew about. Every MMO since then has tried to recreate that success and failed.
---
How am I going to get feared though the door to glitch under IF now??
---
Do it! Just DO IT!
---
Yes, it was one skill. Speeds were based on the mount, not riding skill.
---
The spacing is too smooth on animations. Tauren faces are too round, hair styles on females are alright, not in males though, it's not rough enough. Art director was sleeping, everything is too round and flowy. While the original was stylized, it still kept some realism around, just look at the lvl 40 warlock mount.
---
Stop marking everyone as a hat3r, noob. :p
---
I don't play lock, but cool of you to pick up the work for them.

Yes! Tech support shop. When there are no cases to work with we play games. And I play WoW !

Oh yeah! I forgot about that - had a priest friend who ALWAYS wanted to duel my warrior.
---
...I lost a lot
---
I don't think it's just me downvoting your particular lack of knowledge, buddy.
---
The diamond tipped cane was the biggest flex
---
Tldr someone who only played bfa got classic beta
---
It's the best intro to the genre you could possibly hope for. I say go for it!
---
It is the most iconic MMORPG being relaunched. So ye, i would definitely recommend you to jump into classic wow when it releases. 
---
Also half this community will be so jealous that you can experience wow as a new player!
---
Some do, some dont. Tribulation breeds a much stronger payoff than instant gratification.
---
Absolutely. But have in mind that 15 years passed and classic still has been not surpassed by any other mmorpg (imho), so if you like it and look for another game like it you will have a hard time, maybe ffxiv but it's another style. Careful though, this game is very addictive. If you like it you will not need another game because you will spend so many hours in this one lol
---
I recommend before trying the game, as you said you've never played an MMORPG try one out thats free that way you don't have to spend anything and if you end up liking the feel of an MMORPG in 3 months the game will be waiting for you, however its a $15 USD monthly subscription the game is great so I hope that you end up liking it :).
---
There were barely any private servers in 2006, and the ones that did exist were practically exclusively funservers/pay2win shit with minimum effort put into replicating the real game. 
---
The mob data wasn't created by hand. Droprates came mostly from automated Wowhead dumps, mob locations came from packet sniffing, quest data came from packet sniffing and Wowhead (and was very incomplete for an incredibly long time).
---
Just leveling will keep me busy for a long time.
---
Because they look better
---
&gt; created a game where you don’t need to think much about what you are doing or set goals for yourself.
---
I mean, not everyone's goal is to get gear in a videogame. There are people who play for enjoyment ...
---
If you have any friends playing now its a good time to join them :)
---
I don't know a whole lot about itemization during each phase but I think it's like AQ before you get good stuff.  Maybe PvP Blue set will be strong.
---
Alts ftw
---
To annoy people that want them.
---
If reading the comments in that thread got you thinking it, maybe reply in that thread.
---
Amen to all of that.  
---
100% agree with the idea of a parallel development. Classic+ is the way to go. Imagine revisiting Outland or Northrend, without flying mount, without having stupid power spikes. Imagine there are still 40 man raid. Imagine still playing in Northrend in an RPG style.
---
https://imgur.com/qXwfcZc
---
Doenst look like a 100% race-specific riding skill is needed in the beta
---
Don't like apples? Don't eat food. That's how you sound
---
You're just mad you dont have the power of the light, undead trash
---
My brother actually got me hooked on the game when I was 8. 11 years later and I just finished my first year at uni... absolutely crazy how time flies
---
i disagree. bodyblocking the enemy is a vital skill in the game right now to gapclose/surround and doesn't need to be changed. They would also have to remove it from the old game to even the ground when playing with the reforge version.
---
IF was the main hub because SW didn't have an AH. Also the layout and positioning of IF is more convenient. SW became the main hub in Cata because of the portals.
---
hmm, wasn't it also in vanilla already that you got a gold-bonus from completing quests on max level? Or was that added in at a later expansion?
---
That the factor 10 is definitely too high, either way.
---
Kiss of the Spider
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=22954
---
Ah I see. For some reason i have IF embeded in my mind when someone says vanilla
---
That's how it is on the BETA currently. 20g riding skill, 80g for regular and 1000g for epic mounts.
---
The entire difficulty debate in Vanilla and Retail is warped by strawmen and poor argumentation.
---
Retail players argue that Retail is more difficult, but that is only true for 1% of its content, Mythic raiding and high mythic keys. The rest of the 99% of the game is braindead easy.
---
Classic difficulty is never as hard as the 1% of Retail, but it is objectively harder than 99% of the rest of Retail.
---
I say objectively because just doing the 1-10 leveling is far more difficult in Vanilla than Retail. I dont understand how anyone can argue otherwise. Even a good player, if caught inside a cave with respawns will die, no matter how good he is. That is just not true in Retail.
---
I think it would depend on what your used to playing and your expectations are of WoW and the MMORPG genre. 
---
Classic is more of a grind then modern wow but better imo bc talent trees and other aspects were more varied/complex? and although gear dependent to a degree it isn’t at the same time and you could build your toon to how you liked to play 
---
I would probably try the 10 day free trial wow before buying the game. You can start a high lvl toon as well as a lvl 1
---
Then you have something to think about.
---
Right in the feels.
---
No, unless you're friends with a streamer you aren't playing the beta.
---
Flying is a QoL change without a doubt lol. It makes everything faster and easier for you.
---
"Only 93 days away"   
---
Only...
---
The stealth sound effect just popped in my mind when I read that oh god
---
Look at this dood!
---
Whenever somebody uses incel as a response, while simeotaneously calling out toxicity, you just have to laugh.
---
Even if they reused assets from the expansions but stuck to vanilla principals they would still have a major issue with making the world smaller because everyone would be funneled into one continent that's significantly smaller then even just one continent in vanilla. 
---
While I'd probably like to see them attempt it anyway I think they should go the route of filling in the existing areas of vanilla's continents first. 
---
Redo/finish Hyjal, Quel'thalas? (That small place that has like only one building on the side of EK map). Heck maybe even add some new areas to the old zones - new caves that lead into some new dungeons or raids. E.g one could be around barrens that leads down to where Deathwing comes out of in Cataclysm. Maelstrom is probably an easy zone they could add / slightly modify (since no flying) that should easily slot in with Vanilla's style.
---
may just get a orbweaver or a tkl and a wireless naga lol
---
during WoD, my Rogue was able to constantly move at 237%, without stealth it would've only been something like 192%. It was amazing to always be faster than any ground mount.
---
Which avenues? Other than like I said, confusing difficulty with tedium, bugginess, and poor design.
---
Thanks for your information!! :)
---
DAE USE THE AH FOR PROCURRING WEALTH???
---
Yes. It is fun.
---
Poor tauren
---
did u think this sub would say no?
---
Gear score 😉
---
Until you realize that loot/progression is not the source of the fun. The fun is in the context  and loot can only "spice it up", not create it.
---
They are streaming reactions. Other stream themselves breathing. fuckin' breathing, doesn't get more free than that.
---
I would join a streamer kill squad guild and sabotage everything they do. Fuck 'em.
---
Lol not truly The hardcore version of classic aye?
---
I would love it if there was a classic wow subreddit dedicated to post-naxx fan fiction in this alternate reality.
---
It would be cool for some elemental uprising, perhaps the gates to Uldum being opened? A new take on Grim Batol, Zul Aman etc would be pretty dope, without there being a power creep
---
I HATED Thousand Needles back in the day, I couldn't ever for the life of me find the stairs to the right "needle" before being ganked by an hyena, tiger or cloud serpent. The shape of that zone made it such a pain to quest through, but it's ironically one of the zones I remember the most from pre-Cata and I actually miss that experience a lot instead of just flying from point A to B.
---
You can always do the exploration route to level 5.
---
I actually disagree.
---
For one you can get the exact same loot and achievements regardless of being sync'd or not. 
---
The cases were you it's not optional, FATES, a lot of the unique rewards are pets...that are tradeable... thus kind of defeating the point of winning. Also the spell Protect doesn't scale when sync'd, so if you are doing a level 30 FATE and have a level 70 white mage cast Protect on you, you're basically invincible. 
---
I didn't feel much of a sense of accomplishment in 14 because well, the game has a "Everyone gets a trophy" mentality. If past content like Titan Extreme had you be sync'd as a mandatory requirement to get the loot, then I would feel very proud of my special unicorn mount, but alas that isn't the case and there's no way to prove I did it sync'd or not.
---
I don't think you actually read his post, or mine. You posted a stupid inflammatory comment that added nothing other than to completely misconstrue what he said; as a karma circlejerk.
---
You just spewed a wall of text out and told me to "chill", but I think its you that needs to take a breath and relax.
---
RemindMe! 95 days "do this + /console ffxglow 0"
---
https://itemization.info/item/16842 what's that say
---
if you have waited like 20 minutes you would have seen it happening in every layer.
---
The gold bonus is something that existed in vanilla at max level. The issue is the amount of a bonus that is currently being given. Every source I can find has the expected max level reward to be much less.
---
Was that diamond tipped cane an item in vanilla? I don't remember it, and I can't find it listed in any classic item databases. It only shows up in retail databases.
---
By Post-Naxx, I was referring to new content after Naxx made with the vanilla design philosophy like content that was supposed to be released, but was shelved in favor of BC.
---
Leaving classic with no new progression would definitely kill the game, but new servers will split the player base (like one for BC and one for classic, which is the likely outcome if BC is released) and would also likely kill the game.
---
Post-Naxx content is really the best solution. I wouldn't even mind it being something like DLC, I'd definitely pay for, if only so blizzard can pay for the cost of developing it. I just don't see them being able to charge for BC again.
---
I took my 2 week vacation starting on release day. My plan is to play 12-15 hours per day, making time for exercise (sitting that long isn’t good for you) and sleep. 
---
I want to get far above the curve, so when I go back to work I won’t far too far behind
---
Well if this gets disabled just download an addon which does the same thing instead??? Why u complain about things that are in game literally forever
---
Uhh, what? Protect is a percentage defense increase I'm fairly certain, not a flat amount that goes up with level.
---
I think that's one of the main mistakes that blizzard makes time and time again.. Whenever they release a new expansion, they practically make all previous content negligible. There is so much content they could still have for new players, but it ultimately ends up being worthless for most.
---
It does need to be changed because they’re trying to sell a product and it’s an absolutely awful feel mechanic when 4 units can’t walk side by side through a passage twice their size because their hitboxes extend so far beyond their frames
---
&gt;planning to re enjoy a childhood experience with a little more knowledge this time through , I'm 26 in a position I'm gonna be able to no life it
---
That's exactly my plan, dude. My situation would allow it so I'm thinking of just sinking a whole year into the game. Might seem extreme to some but frankly we're put on this world to have fun and enjoy everything about it so I don't see why not.
---
August can't come soon enough! I'll see you in Azeroth.
---
Articulate, thanks.
---
i mean ur asking this to a subreddit hyped as hell for classic, so yea jump in buddy
---
Just direct it to your BFA install. Once its done just run the client, go to Tools&gt;Options and here you can point it to the classic install where it accepts it fine.
---
I've got a week off at launch and then my girlfriend is away for a further week after. Plan to be at least 50 in that timeframe.
---
Woah
---
The only parts I really still like about TBC are the class changes/additions. Giving druids tree form, for example? Cool. 
---
A lot of the other stuff feels detrimental to the design of the game. Flying made the world feel so much smaller. Sending all the high level players off to an entirely different continent made the world itself feel divided even more so. etc. 
---
I loved TBC at the time, but I think it could be done better today knowing what we know now.
---
Is that Humar the Pridelord
---
use "enter" to make paragraphs
---
No, Orgrimmar will be the main hub.
---
This is very good info, could you share the specs of your beast
---
It's a closed beta, and no
---
I remember fighting a Cyclops FATE that was basically a world boss, and without the white mage's level 70 Protect, the Cyclops had a move that could 1 shot anyone.
---
With the level 70 protect anyone could tank it and not take damage.
---
Probably one of the only valid "why cant I have beta" posts. The level 30 meta does seem pretty cool, and I think they are going to get a level 40 meta soon. I enjoy watching it and get they aren't ready for all of us to rush in, so I'm not mad like a lot of people, but it's definitely sad.
---
I think you shouldn't feed trolls.
---
When I only had normal flying while leveling I would still only use my flying mount, as I didn’t have to pay attention to where I was going. I put on auto run when into the air, then just made a straight line to where I wanted to go. Even if the ground mount is faster the flying mount lets me bypass mountains, mobs, PvP making flying the go to form of travel.
---
Protect is a 15% defense increase, not a flat increase. The Cyclops ALWAYS one shots everyone if he does his 100 tonze swing. You're just remembering wrong and didn't dodge.
---
Yes sir I have a recently purchased recumbent bike that I get a pretty decent cardio workout on daily while being able to still be lazy watching shows and preventing blood clots and heart failure
---
Quin is a quality dude. I don't get how they are hating
---
Are you aware of the x-axis showing the date?
---
Or is reading just not your thing?
---
Assuming servers will actually hold up in the beginning. Me and some friends have thought it through and will probably start 8am and go for 20 hours from there, that way we don't have to deal with the initial wave of dqs and stuff nor absolutely fuck up our sleep schedule
---
That’s great. I thought about getting one of those under the table foot pedals
---
Yeah, having to earn your shit is very different. I did a ton of 19 twinks in Vanilla and every time I had my friend run me through everything and just give me loot. The PvP experience was the same, obviously, but I imagine actually being limited to the content you can do with 4 other twinks would be fun content in itself, and the sense of Pride and Accomplishment would be pretty sick too.
---
wont be optimal , but it will run for sure
---
on the bright side, premade wont be able to queue dodge and will actually have to fight
---
Maybe it seems extreme but my childhood wasn't much family trips here and there  I was stuck on a machine raising myself so being able to resimulate a great experience almost identically I don't really care if anyone has a certain opinion on it lol I I will feel great regardless
---
Wotlk was essentially S6 of GoT. Loved by many, and had a few very good episodes (i.e., Ulduar, ICC, Northrend zone), but then it also had the whole Bravoos/Iron islands crap among other things (i.e., Naxx, Ruby Sanctum). Far from the best season/expansion overall and it was truly the beginning of the end, but people still remember it fondly because of its high peaks.
---
While I agree with this I always thought that there should be some form of anti-Paladin in the Forsaken ranks since they're mostly humans.
---
It was just you, snowflake.
---
Yes and that leads to the famous content droughts before each new expansion. Whereas if they would change their design philosophy to give new or return players a meaningful way to catch up, rather than make everyone "catch down" at the start of each expansion, there would be much more relevance to older content.
---
And it actually got worse. Now even a new raid tier completly invalidates the previous raid tier within an given expansion. Why even play if your stuff will be shit half a year later.
---
Yep. Nothing special as far as cat pets go but he looks awesome. Used to swing past his spawn every time I was in Ratchet, hoping he was there. Not sure on his respawn timer but was he was always pretty rare.
---
somebody stop this man
---
"There are too many tanks on this server" Said no one ever
---
you will be fine as long as you do your job mate
---
new poe league in like 12 days
---
if he plays another class foe a few days by the time he is sick of it should be time for league
---
Vanilla: Ironforge is the best placed alliance city in relation to all major raids (same-same for MC and BWL as Stormwind, but better located for AQ and Naxx). You still used SW for Onyxia head quest and for easy access to ZG though.
---
TBC: Stormwind is closest to Karazhan and the dark portal, making it preferable regarding auction houses.
---
WotLK: Same as TBC, we now have a harbour between SW and Northrend
---
From that point on, the Stormwind would continue to be the best located alliance city for getting into new expansions' content.
---
In an environment with loads of people like in classic it would be quite hard not being able to raid especially if you are slightly ahead of the curve as a warrior however if you only want to tank you probably won’t get an easy raid spot unless you know the guild members 
---
Also as a side note usually something like 8 warriors are brought to raid
---
Yeah any little bit other than being completely sedinatary will allow you to be more sedinatary haha
---
I like this guy, he understands
---
Good, I naturally worry a lot about everything haha, sucks but thanks :)
---
60-80 hours... rookie numbers son, gotta bump those up.
---
Not going to deny that but I will say I only ever used it when they'd turtle with no effort to grab our flag (trying to make us quit out because we had instant queues and they were overpopulated), enemy flag carriers would wall jump into areas that made them unkillable (on top of the massive tree stump or behind the wall in the flag room) or were just straight up hacking.
---
At least lag macro was easy to counter.  If you were in range of the spot where the player was when they started spamming the macro then you could still damage and kill them.
---
Good thing you read the title before you posted.
---
Except this is Classic and those items were added in Cata and TBC, respectively.
---
Ehh, atleast Wikipedia has references that you can look at. Pservers have to make a lot of guesses based on memory/low res videos or screenshots etc.
---
Where does one sign up for a guild like that
---
I'm not super familiar with the rogue, but I'd imagine that the 3 damage won't matter much overall compared to your standard damage, and the damage the hit itself does is way smaller than it would have been with a slow sword.
---
Let's say we're using two Bite of Serra'kris(17.7dps and 1.3sec speed) for daggers, and the other guy is using a Sword of decay(17.6dps and 2.7sec speed) and something else that is equally slow in his offhand. Over a period just under 3 seconds, daggers guy will have time to make 4 attacks and use two global cooldowns. During the same period, swords guy will have time to make 2 attacks and use 2 global cooldowns.
---
Sword of decay has a damage of 33-62, and Bite has a damage of 16-30. The extra 3 damage from hemo on daggers will amount to 18 damage, because we get 6 attacks. The attack built into the hemo itself accounts for 32-60 over the two cooldowns. Swords would get 66-124 damage from the attacks built into hemo, but only 12 damage from the active effect.
---
Obviously I've chosen extreme weapon speeds here, and there's other things that go into it, but the basic principle is sound
---
Rogue or Enhancment time!
---
Would be amazing.  We could always try as a community to do a lot of that fanfiction here.
---
This is a really good point, the fact that low levels never see higher level players mean they don't get to see what they can aspire to be.
---
I am curious what the best way around this problem would be? Cata did add new zones on the EK and Kalimdor which I think did keep players in the old world (general revamp was bad but the new zones were decent at least). This could be a solution for 1 or 2 expansions but I feel players would want new zone looks as time progresses and I imagine you can't keep adding on to a single content.
---
An alternative approach could be to add low level zones to new continents so low level players could still interact with the new content however it does mean an over saturation of leveling zones and splits the player base that way.
---
I leveled mine to 80 and had the chopper and a helicopter.
---
Seems simple to check to me. The server has no say in this. By that I mean nothing the server sends pertains to nameplates or when they become visible. My point being this is entirely client side. (I could go into technical detail, but 99% here wouldn't be interested) 
---
The client used on private servers is the real 1.12.1 client. This is something that can be checked now. If it's true you can set it and it works that is evidence enough.
---
However there is a counter argument. If blizzard decided that this is actually an exploit and they never planned for players to change this, then it's also valid not to allow on new classic. There's counter arguments to that too.... But it becomes less clear cut.
---
That's the right mindset in my opinion too, friend. One of my sweetest memories is rushing to come home from school, hoping my brother would have left the house and the PC free. I would immediately hop on it, sweating balls since hot Summers and no AC, with the sunlight illuminating my room, birds chirping elegantly in the balcony and the Coke sizzlin' away right next to me, taking a  few sips here and there in between killing the next mob or foe.
---
Good fucking times, man. And this time I'm gonna do it all over again, but with a lot more time on my hands and a lot more comfort (personal PC, AC, more cash for junk food etc.).
---
I am not remember this wrong.
---
I should note that it was a level 70 whitemage that was not part of the FATE, he just casted it on us.
---
The 100 ton swing can in fact be tanked using this bug that'll probably never be patched. 
---
I remember because despite everyone tanking the damn thing, we could not win the first time because we could not do enough dps.
---
for 5mans it isnt 
---
but for raids it can get tricky cuz at least the good guilds tend to already have their dedicated ones planned out early
---
Jij is Afrikaans?
---
The problem layering is primarily trying to combat, I think, is one that was not around when WoW first launched: population decline.
---
It's all but guaranteed that in the first week or so there will be many times more players trying out Classic than players who stick around, if only because they have a retail sub and can try for free. If we just let everything be crazy, you end up with huge queues during the first week or so, which is a problem on it's own, and then dead servers after a couple months once the casual players who are just messing around move on.
---
We could merge servers, but that comes with it's own host of problems, including player/guild name conflicts, the economies being smashed together and messed up to name a couple big ones.
---
As of right now, imo, layering is a decent compromise, as long as it truly gets out of the way within a month-ish. I also don't think layering will effect the game as much as most people do, but maybe that's just me.
---
Server 7, layer 3, shard 5
---
Home.
---
It's not a bug. You're just straight up wrong. I've played Final Fantasy 14 for 4 years now, I main a healer. I don't particularly trust the word of a guy on the Classic WoW subreddit that probably doesn't even play the game anymore.
---
They’re so fucking dumb lmao Ez Clap
---
Yeah it was possible in my mind, as far as I knew classic might have been more tailored to the seasoned players and not noob-friendly. I simply didn't know
---
live the dream bro
---
Try it yourself if you don't believe me. 
---
I fought against that cyclops multiple times. You can do the exact same thing with Lupus the giant crab.
---
I might take a day or two off work for it at launch, but will be more of a filthy casual after that. Even then, I'd wondering if it will be worthwhile given the insane number of people who will be flooding the starter zones on that day.
---
Also until 1.9 auction houses where not linked. That meant before 1.9 all the other auction houses beside IF/OG where mostly empty/useless.
---
I've seen this kind of thing before 🤔
---
Interesting.  I'll have to test yours during the next stress test.  If it's fixed in retail I assume it's fixed in Classic.  I tried the sit/stand one last stress test and it doesn't work.
---
Even so, the relevant level scaled content are the roulettes, not the FATEs. The way they ensure that all dungeons, raids and trials remain relevant for the rest of the game out is beautiful.
---
And periods to separate sentences.
---
way back when I played with a guy who was in the top horde progression guild on my server and raided alliance on another server.   we ran A LOT of DM north together as he helped me get that rare tailoring pattern from the goblin cache... so many runs so many pugs... I miss you Starcow.
---
"new server technology" rofl.
---
That thread made me realize a lot thanks guys!
---
People want to play Classic WoW because the game was hard and it felt rewarding to put in all the work, what you're mentioning or suggesting here makes it easier.
---
Mission acomplished, thats why streamers were invited first.
---
Yes, it would be if it wasn't optional. You should not get the same rewards for doing less work.
---
Fem Trolls look god-awful. They don't even remotely resemble the race they're supposed to be. They look like weird humans in shitty cosplay, and 99% of everyone will use the exact same face.
---
I hopped on the stress test recently and even being hours late I couldn't get 1 mob tag for starting quests either way I was content just talking to people and chillin around waiting or missing swings on the lvl 5 mobs that were n
---
ot being camped
---
Playing the game is optional. Everything is. Doing your roulettes is a conscious choice and one that's necessary to progress your gear efficiently. If you don't do it you're massively gimping yourself. And you can't do a protect bug in roulettes.
---
I would like new content but I would always want a non-changing server that preservers what the game was as well. Having both should keep everyone happy.
---
who the hell is searching for "wow bfa"? Surely you would just search "wow" or "world of warcraft" because that's the game? lol?
---
They’ll cash in when vanilla proves to be popular and they decide to rerelease bc and wrath but charge for those.
---
If I want to multi-box or create a brand new account just for classic wow, Do i need to buy any of the games or simply pay $15/mo on a fresh battlenet account?
---
What did I miss in your post? You've only been berating me. As for the original post I replied to, I think I understood his meaning, which is why I replied, but at the end of the day it was pretty hard to understand so maybe I missed something there. 
---
Either way, you're taking this way too personal, I'm not trying to trigger you or something, we just have a different opinion on a subject in a game. We both love Vanilla and want the best for Classic, so why the need to get hostile at the small population of players that we've been hoping to enjoy this content with again for the past 15 years?
---
Thank you so much for posting this. It is too easy to get caught up in the end game grind.
---
Night Elf Priest dudes have a terrible fantasy since NElf Priests were supposed to be exclusively female and only became open to males because Blizz prioritized WoW's accessibility over lore. Like female NElf Druids, male NElf Priests are just walking lazy retcons.
---
I have played sins beta
---
Tanks are always in short supply. Horde or Weenie Hut Jr. side? I'm gonna be rolling a resto shammy and will need to shove my totems up someone's ass to get me to 60
---
I would like post-Naxx, BC and static servers to exist together so everyone is happy.
---
Well the first thing is: Don't increase the level cap for an expansion or if they do: just by 1 level. Therefore you can design the whole new contintent with zones ranging from 1-60 with the sporadic subzones for high end players. Think about Grim Batol for example. Leveling is a core part of vanilla wow and I think a decent chunk of new content should focus on enhancing the existing leveling experience and not just focus on max level raiders.
---
Vanilla works so well because high level zones and content is right next to low level content. Which also gives high level players more incentive to actually help out their lower level friends and engange in World PvP, because they don't have to travel 30 minutes to get back to the "old" continent.
---
Yeah but the problem here is entirely politics. But the two sides have valid points.
---
Blizzards hardware now is setup to provide "super realms" and splitting /merging by zone. This means the zone is rarely empty or too populated. Cool.
---
But the problem is that classic was much more community oriented. By that I mean known ninjas were outed quickly. Prolific pvp guilds became KoS for many guilds and forums were often full of personal arguments because people got to know their fellow realm citizens.
---
A super realm with many layers will not provide this. The people you play with would evolve over time. Maybe even change on a daily basis.
---
So yes I'm personally torn. Both sharding and layering are great technical solutions. But in terms of the way classic was so social, they don't fit so well.
---
In short I would hope this is indeed just used to make the launch run smoothly.
---
Time hating on anything feels fucking awful. I wasn’t even trying to go hard and there was just nothing to fucking accomplish
---
This *does* sound like a huge issue
---
Stop giving these manchildren attention guys...
---
&gt;maybe I missed something there.
---
Yes, well that was kind of my original point wasn't it.
---
&gt;Either way, you're taking this way too personal,
---
Not really. 
---
&gt;so why the need to get hostile at the small population of players that we've been hoping to enjoy this content with again for the past 15 years?
---
Nice strawman, we're done.
---
Relax and move on.
---
Yeah I used to brag about having it 'he only spawns 3 times a day', now that I think about it that's still a lot of spawns
---
For the horde! I’m gonna be a Tauren :)
---
It's possible that the rewards are just weird because it was never designed to work for level 5 characters. Maybe there's some weird scaling thing
---
You can effectively raid tank as like 31/20 so don't forget that you won't be restricted to sword and board your whole life. Don't need to tank? Equip 2hander and whack the boss, or dual wield if you got the smacksmacks for it.
---
That is absolutely a big issue if true
---
The most famous lvl 19 twink rogue on my server at the time accidentally dinged to 20 by falling off the zep to UC lol
---
up vote just for the music.
---
I'll be an orc or troll so hit me up if you need someone in the NA to level with
---
Quin doesn't give a shit about beta or wow, he plays d3 and poe.
---
And what does that have to do with what I just said?
---
Nice I will do !
---
The flightpoints having to be found should be there.        
---
I'd prefer the connected flightpaths though.
---
There is probably a more intricate formula behind how the value is calculated. My guess is that there is a concave value function, which means for higher amounts the factor is rather low and for low amounts high (possibly capped at factor 10).
---
Regardless, checking whether the values are correct is important. Good find!
---
Can't believe how angry you are that you'll waste time trying to ruin their day. Just ignore them.
---
Unfortunately there weren't many other memorable " normal " experiences during my developmental years but I made so many meaningful relationships and gained so much education over the years playing In this virtual world  I just can't wait to do it again even if in a smaller capacity . Of course it won't be the same but I'm still beyond excited. Some of the most memorable and long lasting relationships I've formed with people have come from this game and it's just so nice to be surrounded by like minded people again after so long. Plus I just love  being able to spend countless hours just mindlessly grinding twoards a goal, reality or not
---
&gt;**ONLY** 93 days away.
---
Sigh.
---
Your providing a pic but no date it annoys me
---
Huh?
---
That's pretty much the death nights. Butt...that would then give the horde 2 faction locked classes. Not fair homey. Lol.
---
Lol, hadnt thought of that. He talked like an 8 year old though. And I thought cool, an 8 year old and 33 year old playing the same game and just as excited.
---
No, they did and I did as well. 
---
If you play bgs for a long time every day, you will soon notice which premades and who are in them that queues.
---
IIRC when he started streaming it was from a college broadcast room above the football field. So not far off!
---
Not everything in this life is about min-maxing. Ret paladins CAN be very succesful if you play them right, but I have no illusions that other classes could do well in its place, however, ret paladins can play their own unique role as a frontline support. I really dont see why you are so angry about this, at least that is how you come across.
---
More and more I see people quoting fallacies who have no understanding of them or when they apply...
---
No true logician would do any such thing.
---
I don't think they'll be enough people in each consistently to have good communities that keeps people playing. Keep in mind that we're already splitting the player base with retail.
---
Yeah because we like the design philosophy behind vanilla and don’t like the diversion from the original philosophy than began in BC with flying and onwards. So the idea is maybe there’s good content in other expansions that could be made even better situated in a world that kept the original design philosophies.
---
"losses"
---
With WF for shaman, intercept for warriors, and some other abilities for other classes, it's actually closer to the balance of the old 39 bracket.
---
I agree it should be as it was at 1.12
---
Well, Classic was good. The same can't be said for any other version of the game.
---
I don't know dude do what you want, it was the first mmo to be accessible to everyone where the core content was questing and leveling with friends.
---
I mean the dude was complaining about losing duels when he had no fucking first aid skill, no engi grenades, and very little skill.
---
He's clearly too used to playing ret as a plate rogue with 2 buttons like in retail.
---
Some strange bug with resurrection - in the following clip you can see Asmongold getting ressed but once he accept the ress, nothing happens and he's just left with the option to release spirit: https://clips.twitch.tv/ProudGlutenFreePlumagePeteZarollTie
---
Wait...there’s a name for that uneasy feeling I get doing water quests? I also hate ocean swimming. Lakes are okay. It just makes me nauseous.
---
Millions of people were in your exact situation 15 years ago when the game came out, just fuckin go for it.
---
No he wouldn't - he constantly tells people ret is bad and don't role ret just that he specifically likes playing underdog specs.
---
If you only want ppl to go through the raid ones yes. If you want ppl to clear it over and over again you need to give a reward that is good enough for ppl to take the time to get there and it need to be rare enough that ppl will have to do it over and over and you need possible rewards for almost everyone in the raid. I have a hard time seeing how this can be done whit out a gear upgrade.
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo. Friends and family list. ;)
---
When I started playing classic in 2004, I had never played a PC game before and knew nothing about wow and I had the best time of my life playing any video game. I can't even touch my PS4 or switch now I'm so excited for classic.
---
Ironforge used to have the only alliance auction house. They got added to every major city near the end of vanilla.
---
I mean streamers might keep it alive - if you want wpvp, I think your best bet is rolling on a streamer realm.
---
just try the trial version first  
---
no reason to spend money if u dont even know if u like how game plays
---
This is perfect, thank you
---
I'm just hoping when the tourists get tired of classic and leave, that Blizzard is on top of timely server merges. Their track record on their live servers is not great. Ion mentioned in a Q&amp;A almost 2 years ago that it was time they looked into more merging, and nothing ever came of that. If they take their sweet time on classic merging when it's needed, then people won't be happy.
---
Hope they would fix it for players but not for NPCs. Always hated the fact that nameplates appear only for 10 yards.
---
I remember those days, jesus they sucked. 15k pop is great btw 4Head
---
False, Ironforge had the only alliance auction house until that patch. It wasn’t that they weren’t linked, they didn’t exist.
---
This is nothing new - exactly how it worked in vanilla from what I remember.
---
Nope. Whoever gets the most honor gains the highest amount of rank, so that how much honor you get in absolute terms is not as important as how much honor you get relative to other rankers.
---
On hunter: raptor strike reset the auto shot
---
Yup upvoting, this issue should NOT be underestimated. It’s huge
---
It's going to be exactly as it was in 1.12. That's the point of all of this. Take the good with the bad.
---
I wonder If anyone with beta can test this, having people leave or join a guild en masse.
---
Coming from the arpg scene Quin probably has a slightly different perspective on things. He has most certainly lost plenty of characters with much more time investment in them before. Deleting a level 30 char you've spent a few days/a week leveling isn't really that big of a deal.
---
Karazhan 40 man :)
---
ohh cry me a river, cross realm BG's were already confirmed ages ago by blizzard, no one wants to sit in a fucking 45min que and get rolled over by the same premade, this is what will kill the game.
---
Cross realm bgs were meant to fix faction imbalance. This is not a game killer. This simply gives quicker bg queue times.
---
Nice catch, clearly a bug.
---
For people missing what's happening here it's not about the 'who clicked first' shit - the game clearly says that the flag was returned but then allows the horde player's click to pick it up anyway afterward - look at the chat msgs.
---
Who is arguing? They are clearly not as good as warriors as the main damage dealer, but it can be one of the best supports for a warrior. Paladins are in essence a support class, and whether you go deep holy or go deep ret really do make a difference in playstyle and while holy is more standard, rets can pull their own weight if they are good. I played with a ret paladin in a premade on the old nostalrius servers, he was going for rank 14, and got it btw, and he was one of the best players we had. Don't include a ret in your premade if you think they are the worst, but you could be missing out of great and unique experiences.
---
&gt;we are BFA I mean classic fans too lol this sub is toxic
---
Rofl, what does that even mean?
---
You wouldn't want to do 5pt SnD for levelling, the CP from CS or Garrote will be enough to last the duration of most mobs.
---
A classic
---
ICC would forever be changed ... I don't think I'd like that. I loved that zone.
---
Even in a 25 man raid you have extras and there is always ppl online or you are in a very strange guild. The need to keep replacing ppl I se as a bad thing it giving GM alot more work and destroying the community of your guild
---
I remember reading they said no because they didnt want people to feel they needed to rush 60 or miss out.
---
I guess there could be an argument for them always being available, but isnt half the reason they are sought after that they were rare?
---
I believed they already said they know about this and the way it is in the beta is the way it will stay. I think perhaps it was at Blizzcon? Not sure.
---
Simply not true. I do not bother to write another longwinded answer - see the others I wrote if you care.
---
I don't think classic will be developed beyond Naxx.
---
I do think that if classic does very well the next retail Expac will have many classic features.
---
okay thank you! looking forward
---
ROulettes are literally scaled content. It has everything to do with what you said.
---
I'm not interested in any argument but in terms of viable without being able to heal, you'd have to deal damage close to a mage, rogue, lock or warrior, and I know for a fact that a ret don't. To be defined as a viable DMG dealing class/specc you'd have to compete with the top DMG dealers of the raid, but rets definitely do not, and since they are crap a healing as well they are certainly not considered to be viable.
---
I mean, it would be the same as bringing e.g. mage who can't DPS at all. Sorry for the rough words, but it's like bringing dead meat and dumping the loot given to that player in the bin.
---
The fights in MC are generally all sub-1 min, something I consider to be a short fight. Perhaps not the first time a guild sets foot there but in a week or two it's definitely like that.
---
If you can prove with logs that there in fact are paladins who deal damage close to a damage dealing class, I'd consider adding a coloumn for rets. You saying that "if the player puts in a little effort" won't suffice.
---
Sorry.. :&lt;
---
I can definitely see that being a good solution but I am curious how the progression system would work for each expansion. One thing people love about leveling is the ability to get stronger and get new abilities. Expansions that raise the level cap tend to give max level players a fresh plateau to grow and expand their characters, thus mixing up the gameplay slightly through the years (for good and bad).
---
A capped at 60 character would not change very much from each expansion and would only get "new" features from raid gear which disappears after a while. A way to alleviate this to keep gameplay interesting would be to rework classes at the start of each expansion but that runs the risk of alienating players that looked the old class design.
---
I actually think the artifact system from Legion could be a great comprise in this regard for max level characters each expansion, at 60 everyone gets new talent tree that people can earn a currency for gets replaced every year. It keeps the level cap, allows "leveling" of max levels characters and keeps the gameplay fresh for veterans while also keeping base class design "Static".
---
Sure they might but I think eaven they will do it less and less as bgs and raids take up more and more of there time
---
Naa no chance. People will be clearing more of mc in a few weeks. You dont need all 40 players bis before bwl to clear it.
---
I guess his PR worked, you guys are advertising him for free
---
I don’t think blizzard had started selling realm transfers at that point, thus I’d be fairly sure you could in theory have realms with more than one AQ40 mount.  
---
Prior to Blizz drastically increasing Baron Rivendare’s death charger reins drop chance, I only saw his mount being ridden once by a dwarf paladin in an AV match. By comparison, I’ve seen the AQ mount more often, but not lately since it’s flightless.
---
Please note: The Steam name and avatar is fake. I switched out the real ones.
---
Interestingly you may not get an email from blizzard for the beta, but still get access.
---
It's because Eviscerate does static damage.
---
What you describe is how they work in the beta. For instance, I cannot fly to Grom’Gol from undercity because I still don’t have the swamp of sorrows flight path, even though I have all the others.
---
No I mean if that raid or dungeon is the only place to get meaningful holy resistance and that resistance is needed to actually get better gear, then people will have to run it over and over because they have to equip their whole raid. And you don't have to base a raid on just one thing. You can add a part of an attunement quest to it, give out one new ability for a specific class, have the endboss actually drop really good loot for underutilized specs.
---
You could introduce an item that would create a socket on an existing piece of gear for gems. The options are fairly limitless and devs can get very creative in designing incentives for people to do something.
---
I'm happy about that, but I'm not happy about the way they handle loot.
---
LFD / LFR is literally a benefit, you actually cannot hate on faster raiding. Imagine having to organize a raid for hours or days or sitting in a 1 minute queue, you know which one you'd rather.
---
Loot is basically handled how Wrath of the Lich King did it. Significant loot is either obtained from currency obtained daily/weekly, or from high end content such as end game raids or dungeons.
---
If you plan on leveling on a pvp server I would go demo. Just pick 3 suppression, 2 imp corruption, 2 imp drain soul then continue in demo. You will be so strong against ganker it's not even funny. 
---
On a pve realm though you can basically go deep affliction and just carry the mobs with you or triangle them.
---
That's not how that works. You're laying it out like there's an objectively assigned value to each of the things you dislike and each of the things you like and when you par those up you come out with a net negative, and therefore it is objectively true that flying made the game worse.
---
That's bollocks. You're the one assigning those negative and positive values, and that assignment is completely subjective to what you like and dislike.
---
They're saying that the positive value they assign to the experience of flying through the world is greater than the negative value they assign to the points you laid out. You obviously disagree, but don't go around pretending that you're somehow objectively right. The only thing you can really say is that if someone has the same values as you they are wrong if they disagree with you.
---
Werent the cross realm bgs in vanilla "battlegroup" pools? As in like 5 servers pooled together. 
---
Is this wat you mean by cross realm? If it is i still remember the major player names i vsed in my battlegroup as well as i do the names of player on my servers i had KoS relations with so it wouldnt kill that sense of pvp community inside the bg. Or are they bringing all realms into one pool?
---
Imagine believing a healthy change to the game makes a game worse. Cross realm for BGs makes perfect sense, especially as beyond the first 2-3 weeks of classic's August launch the player base will be considerably less.
---
So overall its not a win-win situation at all.
---
One of my favourite WoW videos ever. Made me roll a gnome mage in vanilla.
---
Look at these salty motherfuckers downvoting you lol
---
Thanks for doing this!
---
If you are expecting to be a prot specced main tank you will struggle to find a guild.  Warriors can dps and off tank with the same spec. You have to prove yourself as a dps who is willing to tank first.
---
Was lfd a healthy change?   I have argued against cross realm since the beginning.   With lfd, I got these same arguments... it's only years later that people realized the problems with it.   I played a good portion of wow pre-cross realm bg and i can tell you it will kill the pvp community.   It was not a healthy change.
---
I don't disagree, but they do have a different incentive structure than other players, and I think this will lead them to kick some life into wpvp from time to time.
---
I think it will be fine, there is a market for everyone and you don't need a huge community to have a good community. Even it it is just one server for BC or Static, it keeps people happy knowing its an option even if they only have something like 5000 players each.
---
If slaying alliance at any given chance isn't enough incentive then I dont know what is!
---
Nono. I like to waste people's time, it has nothing to do with anger, but with being an asshole to the other faction. I bathe in enemy tears and streamed tears and hopelessness is deliciosooo!
---
I've never considered Death Knights as the anti-Paladin class.  Where a Paladin has Exorcism that works against Demons and Undead, anti-Paladin would have a similar AOE the works against the living.  That type of difference.  DKs were more like the Nazgul from LOTR.
---
And of course if they gave Forsaken the Paladin style then they'd have to balance and give Shaman to Alliance for balance or find another class for the Alliance.
---
/r/titleporn

Seeing a rogue in full tier 2 in Ironforge is what convinced me to drop my mage and reroll to a rogue, despite the outcry of my guild at the time.... But they eventually allowed it nonetheless.

it's planned to make the pathing smarter and less clunky. i can agree to an extent that the gameplay needs to be touched up but to me the strategic blocking of enemy is just an warcraft essential.

Velkommen til WoW Classic Norge! 
---
Et fellesskap for alle som skal spille Classic! Vi er straks 400 medlemmer og vi vokser for hver dag. 
---
Hensikten med discorden er å ha en felles hub for alle norske spillere. Her kan vi bli kjent med nye spillere, finne folk å spille med, få en oversikt over norske guilds og snakke om alt relatert til WoW Classic.   
---
Tre enkle regler: 
---
1. Snakk norsk 
---
2. Hold det WoW Classic-relatert 
---
3. God tone i chat   
---
Her er linken til discord serveren: **https://discord.gg/CYEzHAx**   
---
Del gjerne linken med venner og bekjente :)
---
I think I heard Ion saying the first couple of phases would come quicker than the rest. I'm on mobile right now so I can't really find the link unfortunately.
---
I raided in a pretty formal guild from 2004-BC, to see success in classic/vanilla raids, you really don’t want a pickup group. Once you outgear the zone it’s doable, but early on... you want 40 people that you know, ideally on voice chat.
---
In addition to the already mentioned stuff there's also the paladin trinket from Vael as well as a 10% attack speed potion from an alliance quest and such. These all grant attack or casting speed, but actual haste wasn't a thing until the rating system was implemented with 2.0 - vanilla ran on raw percentages.
---
The only fact this is Quinn getting 1v2ed makes this a thousand times better.
---
39-49 is the royal bracket of twinks. 19 and 29 is just oneshot shenanigans. ;p
---
Saw a few mentions and posts here though.
---
Lol Zoomer
---
I'd say swtor is a better "single player mmo" than ESO
---
I got all the BF pieces except shoulders. Two other rogues in the guild got them before me, and soon our guild stopped raiding BWL to focus on AQ 40... I never did get those shoulders D:
---
Thanks a lot for this quick guide, I was looking for something like this!
---
I will be playing a dagger rogue as well and will exclusively duo-level with a druid. I have thought a lot about how to spec and came up with this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMxZGcVZEMec0hRoo
---
But I must say that I like your spec a lot better, I just modified it a bit because I will rarely need to consider doing anything solo: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZhfV0bVzZyMec0hR
---
* After reading through the comments I felt like hemo is not as good as I thought and dropped it.
---
* I also don't think I'll need Ghostly, which taken together gets me the second point for dirty deeds.
---
* I am not entirely sure if imp. sap is better than elusiveness to be honest, but my feeling is that for this specific case it's better to go elusiveness.
---
* I am also not sure if dual wield is worth it, wouldn't the crit from dagger spec be better?
---
* For max level I'd probably make some minor adjustments and go with this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMxcZhfVZyMec0hR imp. S&amp;D is probably more important for raiding, while the overall spec still gives me enough utility to be somewhat effective in PvP
---
Any thoughts?
---
Haha yes, calling someone retarded sure is a funny meme.
---
LFD and cross realm BGs are completely different. You do you do buddy, but sensible people, living in 2019, with a job, perhaps a family, perhaps other IRL commitments, do not want to spend large amounts of time waiting in a queue when there's an alternative to shorten that queue.
---
I'm honestly not a huge fan of big expansions for an MMO but rather dip feed smaller bits of content in patches. I think that worked a lot better. So in one patch they could introduce a new profession and a 2 new low level dungeons and then people would make an alt and get that up. And in the next patch, they could introduce a mechanic to permanently add resistances to your character (for PvE) without wearing a full set of specific gear and then people would log back to their main character and start doing this and I think this would keep the game much more dynamic.
---
Whereas if you have a big new expansion, everyone will just race to get maxed out first and in the process they forget to enjoy the journey.
---
And I think they should definitely give out new abilities, just not as a level reward for getting experience but more like what they did with tranquil shot in MC. I also like the idea that faction reputation is rewarded for intersting gameplay like raiding and doing dungeons or grouped outdoor content rather than having to grind daily quests.
---
Well I'm on the job then! I'll start gathering some data for you, and reply as soon as I'm done (busy with irl atm).
---
Training is the expensive part.
---
He just said that he's enjoying the game because the game have a lot of content for solo players like him. I actually enjoy that because I dislike games that mostly end-game contents are locked if you don't have huge groups to queue with. Ex: Destiny 2 Raids
---
Nothing wrong here.
---
ohh there's gonna be a lot of butthurt in this post :)
---
Can't resist hamstring
---
I've never played WoW before but keep hearing Soul Link is the best PvP spec in the game for Warlocks. Is there a spec tree and guide for it somewhere?
---
I'm assuming it would be frowned upon to raid in that spec and you'd have to constantly re-spec for a lot of money?
---
A whole lot of Death Knight stuff, Paladin as well. eg., you'd use Consecrate and it would drop on the sea floor instead of where you're fighting.
---
Hopefully it's fixed now, but yea it was shocking.
---
Also - Monk &amp; Demon Hunter are totally busted if you try to go through there. Their movement skills just flat out break sometimes.
---
It was a necessary change.  Maybe you didn’t experience the multiple 1 hr+ queues because of faction imbalances and multiple hr queues for AV.  
---
Yes, it was nice seeing other players you knew, but I rarely actually be able to get into a BH and play.
---
&gt; If you start with one little thing you open the path for other things.
---
That is exactly the fallacy.
---
Yea..... I know.... I played the game.
---
What I'm saying is you shouldn't get the loot if you do it unsync'd.
---
&gt; It heavily restricts resource/rare farming abuse. Is there anything missing with these restrictions?
---
It doesn't restrict farming rare materials, which are arguably the most important things to restrict. Abusing layering to farm things that are *already* easy to get doesn't matter too much, but exploiting to farm rare things is the big problem.
---
Take for example Black Lotus. A respawn time of 1 hour (might be a bit off, but that doesn't matter for this example). Let's say there are 3 layers on your realm. As of right now you can gather one, jump layer, gather a second, jump layer and gather a third. Then you need to wait 1 hour before repeating, thus gaining 3 gatherings per hour.
---
But what if we add your 10 minute CD? Well, then you just rotate. You can still just gather, jump layer, gather a second, wait 10 minute and jump again, etc. Effectively you *still* get 3 gatherings per hour. You have the potential to gather 8 times in the first hour if the resource respawns fast enough. Only if the resource respawns 9 or more times per hour will 10 minutes restrict it, and if it respawns every 6-7 minute it is not rare enough to be that big of a deal to "exploit". Much better ways to spend your time.
---
So as I said in my first comment, no - it is *not* that easy to make a perfect system despite what reddit apparently thinks (no offence meant to you).
---
This was confirmed in an interview weeks ago
---
I hate to say it but wowhead isn’t going to be the preferred source of Classic information for anyone except those who don’t know any better. Everything is so incredibly bloated and designed to host more and more content as new patches get datamined from retail. Classic is a static game with a relatively small dataset and all people want is an accurate and fast database site with a shared comment section from the various private server databases for further insight.
---
If you want to be a social media/database/transmog/armory/news site all at once then go right ahead, but services that focus on one specific thing will more than likely be vastly superior. It’s only a matter of time before the correct values are datamined and someone puts together a standalone and lightweight database service that does the same thing you do, only twice as fast with no bells and whistles.
---
PvE. Two reasons, I hate being ganked and I’m not really interested in pvp at all. My favourite aspects of the game are levelling and doing dungeons, so world pvp is an inconvenience/annoyance. Don’t mind the odd BG bit not enough to warrant playing pvp server
---
There is no one shotting at 19 or 29 with 2k hp, 39 and 49 is more one shot then these lower level brackets since more dmg.
---
You'll get your updates when BC Classic comes out. No need to change the game from the original way it was. When you get bored of BC WotLK will be back just in time. It's the better plan imo.
---
Really interesting, thanks for taking the time to write this up.
---
Some Funny Highlights over the past couple days
---
I mean, you don't get any drops from mobs in dungeons if you do it unsync'd, and you can't participate in FATEs for rewards if you don't sync your level to the appropriate level. And if you do unsync Titan, well, you can get a mount somebody else could obtain six years ago. But the armour is worthless now. So you're upset that people can get cosmetic, vanity things easier than you could on content launch? Because no MMO will change that I don't think.
---
Dude don't be an alarmist. It's still unknown how big battlegroups will be, and chances are that they will just make smaller battlegroups of 2-3 realms, which in that case no one will barely notice that cross-realm is a thing.
---
If the gear from one raid to the next doesn't have even the slightest of stat-boost it would make that raid pretty meh to be fair. You might have the right idea but there has to be a carrot on the stick like the gear progression from MC to Naxx. 
---
Most likely they'll just keep Classic servers running while starting new BC servers.
---
Those Models, are fitting perfectly in the Zones &amp; Dungeons where they are present. Show me a single Zone in WoW, of any of the expansions, where the Artists have "failed".
---
This Game was always "cartoony", just like classic WoW ist.
---
Nontwinks= prey
---
Soul Shards don’t disappear, but any of your conjured stones will.
---
Yeah of course, I'm not blaming the discord, I'm just saying that right now the ratio between PvE server guilds and PvP server guilds advertising is something like 1:99, so if anyone looking to play on a PvE realm is looking for a guild right now, they're much less likely to find one than if they're going for a PvP server.
---
That's why I don't think we'll see BC or WotLK servers tbh.
---
I see four real ways of going about this:
---
1. Expansion Servers: Each expansion has it's own server. I see this as the least likely method, because they'd have to run multiple different types of servers, splitting the playerbase quite a bit. This goes above and beyond just "splitting" the community. It'd fracture it. Some servers wouldn't perform nearly as well and would be nearly pointless. The work it would take would be tremendous.
---
2. Cycling Servers: Each server would naturally progress from expansion to expansion. I also don't think this is too likely either, because it sorta defeats the purpose of classic, there's not well agreed upon "cutoff point", and it would anger a LOT of people. It would also take a lot of work.
---
3. Alternate Servers: An "alternate reality" evolution of WoW. Servers with new content. This would take work, and would indeed split the community, but it wouldn't anger nearly as many people as Cycling Servers, and I couldn't imagine it would take more work than Expansion Servers would.
---
4. NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEEE: 1.12 progression servers. That's it.
---
Doesn’t the horde war chief buff give 15% melee “haste” lol
---
Im actually interested in the 39-49 bracket this go around. Was pretty young back in the Vanilla/BC days when i did most my twinks, not sure when i never tried higher brackets. Probably the lack of funds/skill. Lmao.
---
You lost me at "  I love TipsOut"
---
I had 29 twinks i think its about 8 - 9 agi per % crit.
---
pom pyro mages were so fun
---
That's not weird when PvP is a lot more popular :P  
---
Also it's almost precisely 1:4.
---
Odd.. I watched Esfand afew days ago and he was flying past intermediary flight points
---
https://youtu.be/Op9kWkI4F-I
---
Where are you pulling this data that people dont play WSG on retail? ohh wait, out of your ass just like this whole shitty argument in the first place.
---
I'm confused. A casual can raid vanilla WoW especially now that it will be much easier and require lews gear, but getting a decent PvP rank will require at minimum 10-14 hours a day of honoe farming
---
Quest helper it’s a must if you have a life irl.
---
If not, enjoy the game as it should be.
---
Cheers.
---
This is low level facing people with horrible gear, the scaling will kick in quickly don't worry.
---
Yes I look forward to tbc aswell
---
here are your options
---
1) shut the fuck up retard
---
2) kill yourself
---
As long as layering is done properly there hopefully won’t be a need to do exploration.
---
If I get multiple characters to 60 in classic, no way do I want to grind through that again on a fresh server. I imagine they'll just copy characters over if need be.
---
&gt;ret paladins suck  
---
lol no shit  
---
2/3 of the class is dumbster
---
at least we all know up front what we're going to get when deciding to roll a class.
---
Titan arent out immediatly, I think till aq?
---
There are always items that give you some sort of stat boost. Generally MC had better drops than ZG, was ZG pretty meh? I don't think so.
---
This is classic, there is no gear score. An inferior item can be very valuable for certain classes or specs.
---
Should legendary weapons become easy to obtain just because the level cap was raised?
---
I say it shouldn't be, it's a problem.
---
Arena Grand Master trinket.
---
Every companie has there own way of doing things.
---
- internal alpha
---
- friends and familie alpha
---
- internal beta
---
- friends and familie beta
---
- beta invites
---
- beta keys
---
- open beta
---
- early acces
---
- release
---
Not all steps are taken and each step is diffrent for each game and publisher. There is not a basic route.
---
But alpha is always before beta.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/spell=16609/warchiefs-blessing
---
She looks like a ferelas!
---
Pretty much, as its designed to be
---
They do not, try playing in a premade or wsg vs well known players with your ret. You won't be able to support properly because you lack the gear and talents, you won't hit for shit either.
---
You will be frustrated going into classic believing you can actually get away with playing shit like ret or shadow
---
Legendary weapons are useless. Why does it matter? And yes, Legendary weapons ARE easy to obtain. Who can't solo Black Temple in WoW these days? But they're also completely superfluous and only for collectors.
---
Idk why he deleted all that progress though, guess he just wants to play something else. Still would have kept the char myself.
---
Your commitment to Azeroth-themed puns in this thread are Grand Admiral
---
I actually love Classic because of how much fun it is playing solo. The questing is actually tough, there’s no autopiloting like other games... When I leveled 2 toons in Vanilla, I did both of them mostly solo with occasional grouping and dungeons.
---
Well said. It's about finding a sweet spot I think. If the hypothetical ideal number is 5k people per server, they should shoot for 20k max per server at launch if they are expecting a 75 percent attrition rate after 2 months. Problem is no one really knows what the attrition rate will be, and layering allows for essentially unlimited amount of players on a server. Streamer servers might attract up to 50k people and 20+ layers. Blizzard really needs a way to cap population at launch.
---
But the gnome is also a bit higher up than in the 1.12 screenshot.
---
The tuxedo gear required lvl 30, and I thin they reduced it to lvl 1 in TBC.
---
I still remember doing the quest chain for the level 60 one. It's so awesome, and still a little cheaper than epic riding
---
i mean hardcore from poor game design isn't great so they have gone for the best version on vanilla, the talents do make it a little easier but that's only because they make more sense, holy strength right are the bottom of the holy tree for paladins was not the game being hard core it was the talents being broken, as well as many other talents in the wrong place or just out right crap
---
Definitely. Wouldn't you also agree that future classic content should be "simplistic"? Like it would be awesome if new raid content were tombs/temples instead of fighting against planet destroying space aliens like in Legion haha
---
I'm tempted to roll Nelf hunter but go level up with the humans. Not sure if this is a shitty idea because I'd have to go to iron forge for the trainer. But horse mount = best mount. Especially the armoured one.
---
Blizz has said they are going with the cheaper training expensive mount model.
---
I'm really glad you weren't invited.
---
I would say it’s not worth playing a Druid unless you feel you are just attached to that class and playing something else would constantly make you regret not going Druid.  Also there’s PLENTY of time to roll a Druid alt.
---
Because this is the point of syncing, it keep legendary weapons "legendary".
---
They should always be hard to obtain. Yes their stats may be useless now and they only amount of cosmetic purposes, but the achievement should not be diminished. When you look at someone with [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] or some other equivalent, you should always be impressed.
---
Yeah they’re quite awful. Guilds bring a druid or 2 just for the buff, innervate and Bres.
---
But you can still experience PvP with a PvE spec, or experience PvE with a PvP spec. It's not that big of a deal in vanilla, sure if you're premade vs premade but at that point you'll be wasting more money on consumables and running engineering. Or if you're doing naxx, and probably aq depending on the spec.         
---
Like you don't have to be some optimal spec to do content lol, if you want to constantly be the optimal spec for what you're doing then for that there's a steep price to pay.
---
He was also the guy from South Park!
---
I wanted to make an alliance character in classic, but after seeing this (and remembering the music there and in the barrens) I changed my mind. Can't wait for the release.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers
---
Well first of all you should blame your friends who didnt play out of enjoyment of the game and sabotaged the enjoyment of others at the same time.
---
Even the best system I or Blizz can think of cant prevent such behaviors.
---
Also there were battlegroups were you still saw the same people, its not like you were matched with millions of different players.
---
Its not the same thing as dungeon finder at all.
---
Without dungeon finder you can easily form a group, without cross realm bgs I experienced 10 hour queue times for alterac on a 80-20 server, no thanks I dont need that again.
---
It's way better than sharding.  And will only be there for the start.  It'll be removed after a few months.
---
I didnt even know people used something to install addons... i just dropped them into the addon folder. Lol
---
Someone commented elsewhere that the original system made one respawn instantly if all of them were dead, while the adjusted system made the respawn timers decrease more evenly.
---
F
---
Holy shit.. stop with the fucking "this will kill the game" blabalbalba
---
They are doing vanilla as it was, it never died. Vanilla was great, stop complaining.
---
Druid tank is actually pretty good. You can tank all content as a Bear including Four Horsemen.
---
Hey. I sent you a paypal payment for an item in r/Gear4Sale but you haven't replied. I paid you but you ghosted on me after the payment. Can you please answer my PMs to you. 
---
Just give me my money back. Looks like you have a lot of other people to refund too.
---
Follow people that mained druid on classic and private servers. U will hange ur mind. Druids can be extremely strong in vanilla
---
Which flight paths were you looking at in particular? Because there are some absolute monster paths in Classic that might be misinterpreted like that. In particular, Auberdine (Darkshore) to Theramore (Dustwallow Marsh) is a ridiculously huge continuous FP that takes 10+ minutes just for that leg.
---
anyone who played wow at all knew? lol I bet most still dont know to this day.
---
Goodbye.
---
its beta, gonna get deleted anyway, might as well farm some LULs
---
To be honest to me the beta will be a bigger highlight than release with the events and pvp fights
---
Works in BfA as well. Increases max camera distance by a little bit. Not really needed, but nice to have.
---
Yeah, the simplicity is definitely required.  Although, if they did shit like emerald dream/hyjal I wouldn't mind some more "extravagant" or "trippy" shit.
---
The only way I can clearly see what color of skin I'm selecting, I have to go turn down a bunch of video settings and then create a character.  
---
Kind of lame. Hope they fix.
---
The pattern can drop from Rag/Ony but that doesn't mean they will add it to the loot table right away.
---
Point still remains though that unless we know what s/he means by "properly" gear their warrior we can't answer even if things aren't immediate.
---
If you change to a PvE spec, then back to a PvP spec you're spending 40g compared to 100g. That's a fuckton of a difference, and 20g isnt that much if you have a decent farming spot
---
exactly this
---
yes, because we we're all wondering what's quin's background and his perspective of things, the scene he's from and how he feels about life in general.
---
ALSO -  we must be really careful here because millions of players will not be playing wow because some idiot deleted his character.
---
this could be a total PR fiasco!!111one
---
sarcasm btw
---
you're not alone bro...
---
To be main tank in a guild you need to be available for almost all the raids. But there is normally 2 offtank spots that require slightly less attendance if you are going for raid tank be sure you have the time to raid and I'm sure you will find a spot
---
I’m gonna be an off tank for sure, I’ll probably make like 75% - 80% of raids
---
no
---
Exactly like a PvP spec isn't necessary, it's insane. For most people it's not going to make a shred of a difference
---
I'm in the minority... But if we dont get BC, I just want a tiny little more class balance (like TBC), DRs, and arenas.
---
I love vanilla but after a while, it will get stale, and I love arenas... But arenas won't be successful without balancing a little bit and DRs.
---
You need to realize that this is the legion 7.3.5 client rebranded as 1.13.2 and models are stored in the client. Sure the db has a field that modifies scale, but why should they bother with this?
---
When I started I played a druid and met another druid around level 16. I had not yet gotten my aquatic form yet and didn't even know about it. He helped me get it and took me to westfall. We got to 60 together and raided a lot. I'm in Toronto and he was playing in Bahrain and I wonder if he'll be back for classic too 😆
---
I’m not a huge fan of anal, but I’ll oblige if the woman I’m slapping skin with begs for it. I sling yogurt on countless women so I end up powerfucking assholes quite often. I say “powerfuck” because I really get after it in the bedroom. My schedule is so jam packed that I often utilize sex as cardio to save time. This means that I really exert myself. I’m a shredded, musclebound 225 lb titan, both of business and the bedroom (I own 12 car dealerships and have between 1-3 girlfriends at any given time).
---
Stress test wasn't all that great in those regards. First time GM's did the messing around most of the tress testers couldn't even log in. Toward the end when they spawned stuff in SW - that only happened in 1 layer. Could of been in other layers too but my layer had a few hundred sitting there with no gm activity. That being said I'm still glad I could log in after a couple hours but the lvl 5 cap made it feel pretty hollow. I fished for a while, made some alts, glitched under sw &amp; ran around for a while, then waited it out jumping around on the goldshire inn.
---
Which is literally the worst thing about retail wow. I'm glad I will finally be able to set my own pace regardless of what content I want to do.
---
He got rank 14 and I got rank 13 on old nost, I played with him for maybe 90% of my games. If it didn't work we would have done that for so long. I wont be frustrated, because I play the game for fun and min-maxing everything to death is not fun for most people. Ret paladin can and do work even in premades, at least they did on pvt servers. I am not myself a paladin player however, and clearly neither are you.
---
I think they just have a higher skill level required to do good thing. I think druid can 1v1 anyone. You just have to use in the right way or rather kiting
---
Waste peoples time and your own!
---
im a racist i hate trolls and orcs kill them all. human supremacy
---
I thought that was bad because you couldn't make growl unresistable
---
The thing about flying is that it basically wasn't predicted at all the negative effects it could had.
---
When TBC came out we were all pushing our pants with excitement. It was just so awesome. How could anything bad come of this?
---
Then once the problems were discovered it was basically too late to go back without pushing everyone off.
---
I've never played WoW before but I believe I've decided on playing a Warlock. It sounds like they can be pretty strong in Raids and decent in dungeons, as well as being very strong in PvP. 
---
My question is about Soul Link locks...I keep hearing this is really strong for PvP once you're well geared. Is there a guide to playing this that shows the specialization tree and other nuances of the class?
---
If so how do you explain my damage versus lower skilled (defense/weapons) opponents?
---
I was confused at your color picks for the Dagger list but gonna save that for sure. +1 to this post
---
Honestly, I'd love the new content having only symbolic rewards - to avoid powercreep. Be it deployable goodies \[for RP and flex\], maybe a title, maybe a mount, maybe cool noncombat pet...  
---
I think the best reward of all would be to actually visit the areas, that were intended to exist by the OG team. Classis Karazhan, Crypts, Emerald dream, That empty location beyond Stratholme, Stormwind instance... There are so many places. And to be honest, now, that Vanilla is getting it's second chance - without the need to worry about expansions - we have all the time in the world \[of Warcraft\], to deliver those - and in a way, that doesn't change the game we all love. Yes please.
---
Splitting the playerbase?  I quit retail a while ago.  I'll resub for classic.  It's bringing players back, not splitting the existing playerbase.  The people that want classic?  We mostly aren't current customers.
---
That makes more sense. Thanks.
---
I mained a resto druid in vanilla and really enjoyed it. Your heals are still extremely strong and innervate/ tranq are raid savers. You’re incredibly mobile and can stealth which brings a lot of fun to the game. You can keep up with any of the other classes healing wise. While not in the tippy top of the guild food chain, I was in a guild that killed 2 bosses in nax and I was always top 3 In heals, so you’re not going to get left behind. It’s also a decent level. The quests to get your forms are really fun and you get your own special area for both horde and alliance druids to hang out in.
---
Was just about the reply the same thing. Haha
---
Druid main here, I agree you've gotta be attached and you've gotta love the class fantasy.  You're going to be told "you can't do that" and be doubted a whole lot as a Druid.  I don't think the community is going to change.
---
I also think you need a certain temperament.  Someone that is perfectly happy with losing to someone you outplayed in PvP or underperforming to someone you outgeared in PvE.  It doesn't matter how good you get, other classes will outshine.  There's a reason Stormling doesn't bring his Druid to duel tournaments.
---
Yeah it sucks. Pre-cross realm BGs were so much fun. You always fought against the same enemies and you knew them all by name. There was so much hate and vengeance between the factions it was amazing. All that died in BC when cross realms came out. Now you were always fighting complete randoms and nothing mattered anymore.
---
People have come up with some interesting ways to get around that.  Druid itemization is very complicated.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=19947
---
We already have layering in place to ensure healthy server populations, so why aren't we waiting to see whether we actually need CR before it's implemented?
---
Not true. Basically any class other than SL warlock or shadow priest are fair game - given infinite room to kite druids are amazing at wpvp.
---
literally everyone did that
---
Don’t be calling my boy Bobby B a cow
---
The combination of Flying, arenas, BGs, LFR/LFG, and dishonorable kills killed wPvP.
---
Arenas were cool but facts are facts and wPvP is sacred.
---
Well ZG was usually done before MC wasn't it though? Once you got full MC gear there were not many reasons to go back to ZG (mounts and trinkets I think, I didn't raid then). Sure there might be a couple of items there that are good for certain classes but by the time you get to BWL, ZG is even less relevant etc.
---
If AQ had different gear but not better gear than BWL, the enthusiasm for it would be far lower than it was. All I'm saying is that if new raids are going to be put in, there has to be some sort of progression. If it's only cosmetic people will just use whatever has the highest stats.
---
for levelling at least, hemo provides cheap energy cost and the most important part is it doesnt need positioning behind target like backstabs.
---
Id say if you just dont want to level combat (and swords) best alternative is hemo spec. Serrated blades talent helps even more at levelling as targets have less armor through the lower levels.
---
Can't he restore it, or did they fully disable that feature on the character screen
---
Why do you need to top meters? Druids are Jack of all trades master of none. Atleast they do 2 things well rather than one. And as a healer topping meters is pointless. Your jobb is to keep your healing target alive if it is alive at the end of the fight you have done what you are supposed to. When playing a healer the over healing meater is way more important and you defenetly want to be last
---
Indeed. And it hasn’t improved.
---
i agree, i didnt see alot of one shotting back in the day at 19, yeah it was unfair, lol but shit, thats the point. And it came at a cost, fuck tons of time and even gold ahaha.
---
You're quite welcome mate. The upshot is that when you're picking between two mainhand weapons, like when you're deciding if you should roll need on a drop or not, a good rule of thumb is to compare the damage they do after you add attack power. 14AP = 1dps added to the weapon, so a 2.70 weapon gets 2.7 more damage per hit from 14 AP, while a 1.30 weapon gets 1.3 damage per hit from the same AP. This means that slower lower level weapons sometimes make better mainhands than higher level faster weapons.
---
For the offhand, you just go for whatever has the highest dps, as yellow attack only scale off of your mainhand. Although I hear there's a slight bias towards faster weapons for applying poison quicker, which you'd need for pvp. Like I said, I'm not very knowledgeable about rogues specifically, although I've played a warrior and the principles are largely the same.
---
I wanted to say that so bad lol!
---
Is this one of those hive mind arguments on this subreddit? Where retail wow is cartoony and classic wow is not? 
---
This Game, never, in its entire existence, looked anything like "serious". Could you take a single Screenshot of classic wow, of its peak "seriousness". Which couldn't be countered by the same logic in modern wow, where its more "serious"?
---
I get that the Character progression &amp; leveling in classic is much more satisfying. But arguing with "seriousness" of the old world, which was simply held back by hardware is ridiculous.
---
It's been talked about before. They might end up breaking out classic to its own game. 
---
Short answer, we don't yet know that they won't.
---
Absolutely agreed.
---
I bet its a guy playing as that female
---
The flight path journeys were so epic.
---
sonii is such a crybaby, so buttburt that moo is better than him.
---
Can't be done.
---
I geared my twinks.  Then used them as bank alts...
---
Hemo scales on attack speed so the slower the weapon the higher the hit, meaning Swords are best to use with the ability for maximum dmg.
---
That said, Hemo is not used for its dmg ability but more for its cheaper energy cost, especially in pvp where you get to do your combos faster.
---
Underrated comment.  I barely look at the healing meters because it sets me up for unrealistic expectations.
---
Yuge!
---
And the current, active developers of the game that weren't on a team 15 years ago know more about the code 15 years ago than people that actually wrote it?
---
Sure man.
---
WoW in classic had a lot these casual system but they were muted to what the devlopers conisidered a fair compromise on the casual level.
---
so you have simpler systems for faster respawns with limits. in classic starting zone if it gets hammered mobs will respawn in a minimum of say 2 minutes rather than 5 minutes while in retail if the mobs are getting just smashed to bits respawn can come down to secounds insted.
---
i mean even in 2004 people knew dynamic respawn was needed due to ultimate online and just the locust like killing players do.
---
You're not wrong, but there's still value in Kern and Jordan saying this because it can make Blizzard look into it deeper and confirm or deny it.
---
Hi, /u/Dream_loop
---
I'd say that we don't begin advocate for changes to any of the versions of the game. Keep them authentic.
---
I'm looking forward to engineering being an actual profession again instead of the gutted uselessness they've made it on live
---
true I spent the stress test exploring and the first thing i noticed after going to tanaris is i could fly directly to orgrimmar without any other fligh paths discovered
---
Well well, would you look at that. If it isn't "failure" again trying to act like he knows better than the people who made the game. Time and time again.
---
Did you already have it but never activate it?
---
You say stagnation and death of the game like pservers don't stay filled with players on a 15 year old game...
---
Dawg, did you like. It bother to see what this whole post was about?   Dudes just been making wow puns the whole time.  Ever thought you might be projecting what you fear someone’s intentions are?  Maybe you could let people reveal their intentions to you, and realize not everything is wrapped up in internet ideology.  Just a thought.
---
Whenever I see night security sitting at reception of an office building at night I always think how cool it would be to have that time to just chill and play games.
---
Don't like apples? Don't eat apples.
---
It's not like I told him to snip his internet connection or never game anything in his life. Chill.
---
Cross realm bgs came out in vanilla, not BC
---
I wouldn't even say we're 1%, we're much less than that. And yeah, it's sad people won't get to experience it but it's been like this for almost every game ever =)
---
Osrs took a while to get its own section though, classic isnt even released yet.
---
It was the main city on Nostalrius, so I think that'll be the case on Classic.
---
Only thing I know for a fact is that they are keeping the “jump off next flight point” button, and that was not in vanilla. In vanilla people logged out and in again to stop and nearest flightpath
---
What does the sit macro do to counteract bank? Genuinely curious
---
Druids get to have fun in WSG and defend in AB.  Rogues get to have fun everywhere else and defend in WSG.  *cries in druid*
---
It's commonly used as a part of the ["back in my day" meme](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=back%20in%20my%20day), so yeah you got the gist of it.
---
“Huge issue!” 
---
Isn’t even true. You guys need to do something else lmao
---
Cannot talk for healing Druids, but i can for tank and DPS.
---
So why do u wanna play Druid is the question? Because u like the class? Then go for it. Every Casual Guild would take u, if not they are stupid as i'm pretty sure u could beat most of the DPS if u put the time into it. But like i said, if u put the time into it. It's not a joke playing a PURE Feral DPS as u will need TONS of consumables.
---
For tank, u can definitely play it. Tank is not nearly as bad as people thought it is. In some fights it's even better than Warrior. + u will also be able to DPS if ur not the MT/OT. That being said, even a more progress oriented will take a Feral tank into their raid, but more than 1 is not likely. But PURE DPS Ferals might not be taken into a raid in more progress oriented raid guilds. Same goes for Balance, except again, ur joining a casual raid guild and again, u have to put the time into it.
---
I think if you're exclusively duo-leveling, then you get less out of Sub stuff and more out of Combat, because you get to backstab more. If you're not picking up Hemo, then I'd definitely get Improved SS instead of LR, just for when you have the agro on a mob, or if you happen to solo. 
---
If you're gonna raid, I would forget about going down the Sub tree. Combat daggers are still decent for PvP, but Sub is pretty awful for PvE.
---
TBH, for both your leveling situation and for raiding, I'd do something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xfoLZGcV0rEz0boV (with Remorseless instead of Murder for leveling)
---
I mean if you cant handle the class you dont have the skill :S
---
Druid is awesome in vanilla, watching soda is actually a comedy show
---
You can do it in BWL gear, but AQ items like the fire leggings, trash drop ring, femur and twins offhand definitely makes it easier.
---
Its solo for those who plan every encounter and have poppables.
---
During the stress test I also had the occasion to try this, and I couldn't fly to Menethil from SW I believe. I had both fly points but not Ironforge so I couldn't connect, so I would say it works that way?
---
Yup... I think we just have to wait for release
---
When I first saw that preview about flying in TBC (I wana say it was a gnome flying around on a nether drake) I thought it was the fucking coolest thing ever and I couldn't wait. 
---
Halfway through the expansion when when any PvP scuffle was completely shut down when somebody just decided to fly away I realized it was a mistake.
---
&gt; its beta, gonna get deleted anyway
---
He could've kept his paladin for more testing and stuff, which being on a beta is all about. But ye this guy is obviously just fucking around lol..
---
I can’t stand the twitch memes like that. I know it’s younger kids and stuff, but the omegalul and lulw and poggers stuff makes me feel old and out of place. I need an old guy less meme oriented stream.
---
What is this supposed to prove?  A random ss with no reference or comparison to current model doesn't really prove much.
---
If you’re a good tank you shouldn’t have any trouble getting a raid spot. The downside being that you will be expected to attend a lot of raids. 
---
Outside of raiding though. Make friends with a healer and a warlock and you’ll be able to run any 5 man you want anytime. 
---
“Tank, heals, lock, looking for 2 DPS Dire Mail tribute. Will summon”

“We’re good, thanks for your interest”
---
Having just watched a stream of a guy that's never played wow before, I don't know actually. I'd recommend looking up some guides if you do go for it, it's a very fun experience when you optimize it a bit, but it's kind of tedious jumping in at the beginning.
---
I'd recommend you try to make way to the group content; that's where the experience shines the most. Do a dungeon as soon as you can, either Deadmines for alliance around level 17, or Ragefire Chasm around level 13.
---
Did someone order a bomb?!
---
It’ll be a casual guild. We don’t care a ton about clearing every instance.
---
I know. I know it’s impossible to wrap your minds around casual guilds.
---
RemindMe! 95 days "xd"
---
Thanks!
---
Battle shout does not generate aggro when buffing allies, while fortitude buffing does. (As far as vanilla guides go it should and it was changed TBC+)
---
In case you're still confused, colors are based on where the daggers come from (quest/drop/bs/vendor). Seemed like the most useful thing to know at a glance. Thanks for the up :p
---
he;s not talking about "game killing" but about community killing which is the main point of having classic in the first place but yeah i prefer it to waiting 1h for a game.
---
Yeah! DAE Monomyth?
---
daily reminder that this guy didn't even make it into the stress test even though he's one of three original vanilla game devs. while everyone was having fun on the stress test he was literally streaming himself watching vanilla wow vids for hours on end
---
It’s a casual guild. We’re looking to have fun. I maybe have like 6 total hours to play a week, so even getting to BWL will be a long shot.
---
I imagined RP server and he was the guild mathematician :)
---
Each Expansion had its own section in WoD era, but Blizzard wasn't happy when Soda was streaming WoW vanilla private servers with more viewers than WoW latest expansion, so they made Twitch group every expansion in one section.
---
So I really doubt that they will do that again, imagine just for a second WoW Classic having more viewers than latest WoW Exp.
---
I'm sure they've modeled it and decided this is the way to go. They've go almost 15 years of data from multiple games and monetization strategies to base it on. I wouldn't be surprised if their data shows that the subscription only model nets them more money due to the lower barrier to entry.
---
My own anecdote is that FF14 has hooked me in this way. I'm playing it in the downtime between finishing BoD cutting edge and 8.2/Classic. I wouldn't have bothered if there was an upfront fee. But I tried it and it's fun enough to throw some sub dollars their way for a bit.
---
Either way, as someone who plays BFA, and will continue to play BFA, I am very happy with the approach.
---
This is a big issue.  If they really just took Legion and essentially are trying to manually overlay Vanilla on top of it like it increasingly looks like their doing, there are going to be a ton of little things like this.
---
You still have wow, but where’s that girlfriend now? Shoulda bought more time
---
Well ZG was added a lot later than MC and my point is, adding raids that drop less powerfull items in most cases is totally fine. And yeah people will still do the raid even for 1 blood trinket.
---
&gt; If AQ had different gear but not better gear than BWL.
---
Only AQ40 did afaik though. I agree there needs to be progression, but it doesn't always need to straight upgrades.
---

---
People on this subreddit are strange, I liked it when it was 20k subscribers... I like the post OP. I think it’s worthy of mentioning.
---
Im shocked no one is talking about how the flight paths are missing their animations they lost in cataclysm, how everytime they changed direction they would lean in that direction. I always wondered why they lost that, it was so much cozier to fly when it had it. And it wont be classic if its not brought back!
---
"Retconned" to four. I'm still 100% convinced they're gonna pull a fifth old god out as soon as we think we've finally won.
---
If you just wanna do dungeons when your friends are on just stay fury, especially if you’ve effectively out-geared the dungeons by having pre-raid BIS. Level 60 dungeons (and even MC and ZG) don’t really need full mitigation. Taking around 17 points in prot can make your life easier as you get imp shield block, defiance and last stand though. 
---
That said, there’s nothing wrong with full prot, you just don’t really “need” it for tanking.
---
I think the question might go back to why are you no lifing but not helping your main guild. There's always runs and farming that need to be done. I think you're going to get caught up in unmet expectations by phase 3.
---
I raided as 30/21 quite often in vanilla while trying to prove feral was worth a raid slot. Essentially, healed in half tank gear, ready to feral charge adds at a moments notice.
---
Think doing this would be looked down on these days as watching dmg/heal meters is a lot more prevalent... but it eventually worked for me back then and I became 2nd OT and went full feral tank in raids
---
30/21 is reasonable for PvP, but you need to mix healing gear (int for shifting and healing) into your set as until AQ40/R13/R14 gear ferals dont have enough burst dmg and you have to play the outlast game - this is probably the number 1 thing most feral fanboys will struggle with i think in classic. The lack of Natural Shapeshifter (-30% mana cost on shifts) is really noticeable.
---
If you go full feral gear in PvP you will essentially get 1 heal and a few shifts off before you are OOM and useless. It may be a little better with the updated blue PvP sets, but they still dont provide all the mana necessary for feral to really excel in duels and wpvp.
---
Thats not how its going to work at all. The **whole world** will be layered so when leaving the start zones you wont suddenly see people from layer 2 unless you get invited to layer 2. 
---
Its not just going to be the starting zones and its going to last phase 1. How long phase 1 will last is anyones guess, I think somewhere around 3-6 months.
---
The scorpions are invisible without this
---
Phase 1 how ever long that will last, It wont be weeks could be several months. I doubt it will last longer than 6 months though.
---
It's not about how many raid spots your specific spec/class has. It's about making stand out as a player.
---
I have that specific blog post saved, and there's a comment on it that says that they already used similar tech for the starting zones. It could be that they just turned things up a notch for TBC.
---
Good work! I'm also a developer with no experience with addons, but I'm interested in necrosis, too.
---
I can try to take a look if you get stuck somewhere.
---
&gt;assuming there's only 1 spot in the r14 bracket.
---
Yes, there is only 1 spot per week to get R14
---
people are surprised because they forgot that there was once a time when devs didn't just take something good and mess it up.
---
Qizmo - bestial fury rank 13. Pretty good and fun :)
---
Makes me drool just thinking about it
---
Yep that's accurate. No matter what your spec as a rogue, you want a slow weapon in your main hand to increase the damage of your abilities (for daggers, 1.7-2.0), and a fast weapon in your off-hand to get more poison procs (for daggers, 1.3-1.5).
---
Yo you got some salt in your neckbeard
---
GEAR OUT?   they also got ALL dragonkin whelpling, oozes, and everything else a lvl 1 could use.  And 4x 16 slot bags obviously  (no I was not crazy enough to go for bottomless bags. )
---
A simple quest helper like questie will get you far.
---
The first 4 bands or so was practically all I ever listened to back then 🤘
---
Hm... I believe none cares about this...
---
Resto druids are great, every raid needs 1 or 2
---
Moonkin is called Oomkin for a reason, it does no damage for about 2 seconds until you're out of mana
---
Feral dps is pretty bad but your melee and hunter party members will be very happy to receive 3% more crit
---
Feral tanks are pretty bad, they can't block so they end up receiving crushing blows in pretty much every hit against bosses and there isn't enough good leather gear for you to be able to be defense capped so ultimately the best you can do is tank trash. Dodge is slightly higher than a warrior's but is completely overshadowed because of a lack of parry. Feral tanks also do giga bad threat so if you have proper dps in your raid they will overaggro very easily
---
Alright thanks!
---
I am a longtime wow player with focus on pvp/bgs and always played melee (war, rogue, dk, pally) with a few lower level casters.
---
I just used my 110 boost on a warlock and really enjoy the affliction play style. I notice I get focused 90% less as well in group pvp which is nice. 
---
I was thinking of rolling a lock or mage for vanilla but the soul shard idea of gathering and storing them puts me off a little. I’m always going through them in bgs for things like seed of corruption or that other one, I think called absolute corruption or something. 
---
Compared to a mage it seems quite crippled to have some of your most powerful spells require a resource you may not have when needed.
---
It’s a shame because the feel of the class and theme is really cool. I always liked the lock play style in hearthstone too. And the pets seems like a nice addition not something I have to worry about too much. 
---
Anyways just some thoughts :P
---
This is inaccurate. You need a minimum amount of points to be able to increase standing due to decay and other factors. You can never go up a rank with 10k honor in the upper brackets, even if there's no one else.
---
would be nice to have a comparison video to beta :D
---
What? BFA was once a product that wasn't out that people wanted info on too. Your argument is dumb. They're both peaking pre-release.
---
can you share the table of contents? looks cool, :)
---
You’re doing gods work son.
---
I don't remember exactly, but you spend gold throughout the quest then you reach the final phase: Kill X demon boss in diremaul. The boss only spawns when summoned by a special item that costs a few hundred gold (or materials)
---
The quest doesn't care if u actually buy/make the item, just that u kill the boss. So you can find a warlock that already produced the summoning item and pay him to summon the miniboss for you
---
:) thanks. brings back some great nostalgia
---
I think the travel form hitbox is 10% smaller than normal hitbox at least. I remember being unable to enter stormwind bank after drinking firewater unless I shapeshifted
---
you don't have to imagine. It's already happening XD
---
Don't have access, I can try clipping if I see a streamer on a flight path...
---
Tank / healer for sure,
---
If you plan on raiding Is your wife comfortable not being the main tank? It's just not going to happen as a druid unless you're the GM and a casual inefficient guild.
---
The internal reference that is based on guesswork data?
---
Because seeing a cat fills you with Glee.
---
Unguro be unguro tho.
---
I envy you. I would give my left nut to be able to "discover" wow again.
---
Kittys will be taken by more casual guilds but it's not going to be super easy to find a raid slot
---
I want to level this way because it seems fun and rogue-y. My plan is to use a sword and dagger combo to make the most out of ambush and backstab whenever possible, but use a macro to swap hands when I need to fight something straight up for better SS/GhS/Hemo damage. I have a question I haven't seen answered anywhere though, maybe someone here can lend me some insight.
---
How much of a difference does Master of Deception make in practical applications? I know how the math works for the stealth formula, but what is the difference in terms of yards at which equal level mobs/players can see me between say 0/5 MOD, 5/5 MOD and 5/5 MOD with shadowmeld?
---
But not separate, that's what I'm saying.
---
I plan to snipe and try to mess up with them.
---
Will be good PvP i guess.
---
If not, where did u get?
---
while feral is kinda bad, feral alliance is much much better than feral horde because paladib blessings (kings and might) are really strong on cat form. 
---
Hordies, however, get windfury totem which does more dps than the blessings would have given you, but windfury totem unfortunately does not proc in animal forms. Cue the sad violins
---
One thing I really missed was being able to make groups with randoms in open world and not be shunned for it. Instead of "learn to play" it was "oh fuck yes I died to this guy like 30 times thanks for the invite!"
---
The world of warcraft was a lot more communal back in the day, and in gonna love that. The feeling of getting a group together then leaving the city for a dungeon was sooooooooo amazing. God some of the best times I had was during the journey to the instance with a group.
---
Druid has the ability to perform all 3 roles competently.  That’s reason enough in a time when re-rolling isn’t quick and easy and having alts that are sufficiently geared / attuned is nigh on impossible without insane amounts of effort.  They also bring things to the table many, if not all, others want or need such as innervate and rebirth.
---
Further, while I can’t speak for modern private server play, during Vanilla it also didn’t help that itemization was not something that players (or even Blizzard) had a handle on. The idea of spell power or +healing stacking was really only understood by a few and followed by fewer. Druid tank itemization is an even odder list. Those that knew what they were doing would have been extraordinarily rare. Today we are more fortunate with extensive knowledge and theorycrafting to be able to push the game far beyond anything that people during the Vanilla days would have hoped to do. This includes itemization of druid tanking gear.
---
This was pretty much my go-to addon from mid-Vanilla through TBC as a warlock.
---
Timers I think can be handled with CastBar addons being planned for Classic. Most of the locks I raided with used dedicated timers for this, as their options were much better.
---
I'd recommend a few things for feature restoration/development:
---
1. Shard bag management (as above)
---
2. Nightfall proc notification/SB button appearing above action bars. You used to be able to scale this button for a quick click or bind it to a button press when it procced (I think I used "R" in the old days).
---
3. Easy rebind for lifetap.
---
4. Quick summon/sac of demon (basically allows you to summon + sacrifice the demon, then re-summon another - this would take multiple button presses, but having the action appear near the center of the screen would be helpful).
---
sometimes slopes actually are slippery. if you're looking at a water slide made of ice that's covered in oil and some guy says "it's can't actually be slippery though; that's just a fallacy" then that guy is dumb
---
Ahhh okay. Damn yeah then 3-5 sounds about right.
---
I'm pretty sure the stress test beta is just a layer on the closed beta realms. It's too bad Blizz didn't just let all the vanilla subs into the beta. WSG could have used more players for testing. Its probably a lame Marketing strategy anyway. I'm actively looking for a another game to play this summer since classic won't be available. It won't be retail BFA though.
---
I had two flight points. Darkshore and Theramore. I was able to fly to Theramore. Doesn't seem correct tbh.
---
What an idiot
---
I was looking for this comment lmfao
---
I've seen them used with Rogues on defense before to some success.  Pretty good turtle class because people are forced to fight into them.
---
My theory, loose though it is, is that the flight paths in the Classic Beta are visually operating like the retail flight paths but mechanically like Vanilla 1.12.
---
If my memory serves linked flight paths did not change the visual behavior of flight paths. You still "connected" with each individual flight path while en route to your destination, the only difference the 1.10 change made was that you no longer needed to manually select the next flight path.
---
At some point after that, perhaps 6.1, it was tidied up and the linked flight paths was now a visual feature as well. You'd no longer "connect" with the flight paths en route as you had before, but instead you flew directly from the original point to the destination point.
---
big if true
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
At least for leveling I do want the improved stealth though ... you know, because it's fun to sneak around with a cat at your side and just make Allies implode instantly.  :D
---
Otherwise I totally get your point, so maybe for leveling something like this would work: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZGcV0rEz0boE0xc
---
As for max level, this really depends on how much I will want to do PvP on the side anyways, but a more raid focused spec will most likely be what I want to go with anyways, so your spec would be better than mine for sure.
---
Its pretty close but i dont work security in the literal sense.
---
Honestly finding any MMO with good professions now is hard. I think they were better in TBC and Wrath (though kind of mandatory in Wrath) but vanilla is better than most things out there.
---
I want them too. I remember there being some fun stories in the roleplaying section.
---
You answered your own question...
---
As a hunter main:
---
REEEE no changes ;)
---
Damn, too bad :(
---
Thanks anyway bro
---
Because I’ve seen more guilds break up from totalitarian GMs than unviable specs.
---
Check out twitch.tv/kala he only plays shadow priest and coaches pvp.
---
Really? This has to be a troll
---
You’re looking at this from a “return on investment” perspective. That works well for overall business investment decisions or growth opportunities. 
---
This isn’t either of those things, though. This is investing in the product, and it’s not a high expenditure investment. The cost isn’t large at all and the potential ROI is massive.
---
It's just a cloth. No lvl requirement. I had one bank with full tux and an icy weapon enchant.
---
"right now" as in retail or in the beta?
---
It will be an absolute disaster is starting zones with 500 people trying to kill 10 wolves when there are only 20 that spawn.

I was just trying to clarify that they aren't always easy, and become more complicated in the late game, I didn't mean while leveling. But thanks for the additional info.
---
Uhm, we have very different definitions/goals for syncing. In my opinion level synced content is done to keep the content relevant. I couldn't give a rats arse about Legendaries, that's just retail WoW that makes them OP as fuck if you use them in Timewalking. And  Thunderfury is not impressive in retail WoW anymore. It's useless. Sure in Classic it's noteworthy, but by now it's 13 years outdated content.
---
rip papa franku

What makes you so certain most people will only sub for a month or two?

why test on a class you dislike

he's just gonna level up something new

We should be glad, that we're finally getting the classic servers.... I don't know man seems like people will be never satisfied...
---
I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's always been possible to flight straight from Orgrimmar to Gadgetzan.
---
Here are [flight paths as they were in 2007](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Flight_path&amp;oldid=582515)
---
Your job as a shadowpriest in premade WSG and AB, is defensive work. if you get a spot that is. Most priest do a disc/shadow hybrd, so they are atually useful instead. They go kinda like an offensive healer instead.   
---
Shadow is good in pvp, but in a controlled premade, there is better alternatives.
---
The cap at 30 is lame and I’m not sure what purpose it serves for a closed beta that is already super exclusive.
---
But I’d need a spot to prove myself though right?
---
Dude I thought the same thing. The random laugh, his expressions, I think he murdered someone before.
---
Lotta scrubs
---
Also alliance is closer to gnomer for manual crowd pummeler farming
---
Basically the same as endgame at 60?
---
There's something wrong with playing solo? K.
---
This is wrong... i am in the beta and the way OP claims is not how it works
---
Wasn’t it confirmed that these will be honored if redeemed in classic wow?
---
I can't tell which one of us had the most outlandish reaction to this absolute fluff post
---
Oh yeah, sarcasm btw
---
I seem to remember you only needed a few of the intermediary flight points, but not others, but I could be wrong on that though.
---
Yeah you'll suck in raid with it (20/31/0) but the raiding specs can hold their own in pvp. By late game SL loses its edge because damage increases so much. Raiding specs are fine to pvp with but SL is not fine to pve. You would end up respeccing.
---
yes, you kinda need those and enchant every single one of them too be the top dog as a druid
---
Oh, nonono. I live to please meself.
---
Sure. I uploaded a few pages [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/dDFTws5)

I already intend to create my own guild along with a group of friends. Though, I'm more curious about how useful I'll be :)

I'd like to see this fixed as well if possible, given the amount of time that will be spent on flight paths.

Resto Druid was competitive as fuck in vanilla
---
Lmao he doesn't know
---
Because Druid is one of the funest classes. Who cares if you dont top the charts.
---
Like I said in another comment, if you have more than 2-3 ret paladins in your guild you have other problems. Your holy paladin class is in mutiny.
---
Yoooge jerry
---
You're objectively wrong. The new female undeads are much cuter.
---
So strange to remember the time when every company was trying to put out the 'WoW-killer', and the only one that ever came close was FF14, but by the time it had released retail WoW was already on the decline.

Soul shards are only used for summoning pets, soul fire, healthstones, soul stones, and the held in offhand stones (fire/spell). It's not hard to keep a bag of them in classic. Limited resources are a part of the classic RPG element. You'll have to buy reagents as a mage to open portals and I believe a reagent for casting arcane brilliance (the raid wide arcane intellect). I've mained a lock through the entirety of vanilla and I've leveled two to 60 on private servers. You can solo quite a bit as a warlock and are less squishy than a mage, but you don't have the ability to AoE farm ZG or BRD. Both can farm DM east. Warlocks can solo princess in Mara for large brilliant shards or the demons in winter spring for the eye of shadows. It evens out in the end.

Shaman Tank is like Paladin Tank in the scenario you're describing. No one would ever be that stupid to take them as MT or OT. They CAN be 3rd/4th tank, but they can never be effectively a Tank where they have to taunt or get off a mob from another tank.
---
But let's be honest, how many guilds will actually be willing to try out a Shaman tank even if their just the 4th tank?
---
Out of curiosity, did you get a second 'Beta' option in your drop-down or no?
---
Actually.... that's melee haste not haste haste, which gives spell haste too
---
As a baseline, retribution paladin does need some dedication to be a viable DPS. This spec has the widest range of consumables that can be used (although its not needed to use all of them, you only need a few of them really), and getting the gear, especially pre-raid BIS is going to be severely difficult. However, as you roll through the raids, especially AQ, gear will come more easily. The ret paladin gear has two phases: pre-AQ and post-AQ. Pre AQ build is kinda like a warrior, focusing on dealing huge damage with your basicattacks and SoC. However, once AQ rolls in, there is a LOT of gear designed for retri paladins (they all have a lot of agility, intellect, strenght, crit and spell damage), which means that your spell damage abilities - consecration, judgment, exorcism, hammer of wrath, holy wrath, darkmoon card, heart of wyrmthalak, shadow oil, lifesteal etc. - will deal a LOT more damage. At this point you'll have a better mana pool aswell, giving you more room in long fights.
---
As for proof: this was done on &lt;REDACTED&gt;, where SoC was around 10-15% better than on other pservers damage wise, but people have been testing it on Classic Beta, and it seems that &lt;REDACTED&gt; nailed SoC - it is powerful.

Both Esfand and The Vanilla Dream have a lot of retribution paladin content that I recommend checking out. And the thing is, not even these two got retribution 100% right, but both are VERY close.
---
If you want to, maybe I can put together a BIS list for your sheet?
---
I guess Du hast would be the natural choice. Do you have any examples of where it is featured in a clip?
---
To be honest BGs themselves were community killing.
---
In vanilla we had a our GM premade and communicated queues with the horde’s premade to avoid each other in an effort to avoid drawn out games and after getting warned by a GM for win trading.
---
Honor system kinda forced min/maxing and really took away the community aspect of PVP in favor of having to grind for ranks efficiently.
---
You need to loot 10 wolf meat. And it’s not 100% drop chance. So you’ll end up killing at least 15.
---
The cane in screenshot is added in WotLK, so? :-P
---
Shard bags are a classic thing.
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brbowd/_/eocdh1k/?context=1
---
That’s exactly what I’ve been thinking as well. BC was great but there were elements that started the slippery slope, such as an instanced world that removes the majority of the players from the main world, flying mounts, etc.
---
You mean... alt tabbed during taking FP?
---
Ha, jokes on you! Even if my casual guild even gets that far.....
---
But really, one ret pally is not going to murder the raid. We did it in the early 00’s when there was far less information available for every fight.
---
Saying "facts are facts" doesn't make something a fact.
---
And if you think arenas are on the same level as LFR then I don't really want to argue with you.
---
good shit
---
There is a reason why there is a talent called thick hide in the druid vanilla skill tree, because you need some to play the class to its maximum in order to be viable and resist the flood of naysayers about the class ;)
---
As long as they unban me. &lt;.&lt;
---
The point is you needed to know all the flight points in between, just knowing the Tanaris FP and Orgrimmar FP isn't enough.
---
Why not? I'm not saying he should stick to his paladin. If he wants to level a new char he is free to do that, I just think it was unnecessary to delete his paladin when he could still use it to test things and find bugs.
---
No it doesn't. Demo Shout generates 43 threat on each target, that's way less than thunder clap.
---
Refusal of the call
---
The warlock epic mount quest was by far one of the best class quest ever.
---
Oh hey look it’s this post again!
---
And yes , don't assume retail druid = vanilla druid , it is a cool , lovable class but it takes engagement to make it viable , you can't half assed it , except maybe for resto
---
Classic is grind heavy and your character feels weak. Thats what people call hard. Ofc its not hard skillwise, you only need to spend time. With the later expansion your character got stronger compared to mobs etc. You can AoE big groups alone and do all the elites alone. There are way less elite zones outside of dungeons. 
---
Boss mechanics ofc got harder over time, back then people had shitty pcs, shitty internet and no clue about specs or gear. Thats why it feels so easy nowadays, because we know which items are good and which specs are the best. If they had harder boss mechanics back then, even less people would have cleared content.
---
Rotations are still easy to this day and if you consider them hard, you should try playing games that really need skill.
---
PvP in WoW was never meant to be competitive. There is too much rng and the balancing is too hard, thats why WoW never became popular for esports.
---
I'm literally working from home with an Achilles injury for the next two months and all I do is watch classic wow on twitch all day 😩
---
Well less useful than you would be as resto, or a rogue
---
Nameplates are client-side feature. So that's the case when you can confidently test it on private server.
---
Indeed. Just imagine those 40 swords from Sm and Rfd quests or warlocks staff or the mount... There is so many things to aim for while leveling.
---
That's how it was in vanilla. Haven't you ever played a private server?
---
What!? How about the alpha female trolls?
---
Not in vanilla!
---
I think it's still a bit slower to get to booty bay and port rather than going straight from IF, though I've not played alliance in forever so I don't know for sure.
---
Yep.
---
This actually makes a huge difference. The imp would effectively double it's damage. The talent "bug" for those who don't know is: The imp had a 2 second cast on fireboat. With the talent it would be 1 second, but the GCD from casting would still have the spell cast after 2 seconds. I for one, welcome shotgun imps.
---
Well... that’s not how beta is working..
---
RemindMe! 95 days “do console commands”
---
Ret paladins seemed really strong at lvl 30, what a waste
---
I’ve been dabbling in UE4 lately and really wanted to make a game that has HR graphics but has that simple wow graphical feel. Where did you get the wow model export? On the marketplace?
---
I didn’t, but now I think I will!
---
The way it worked in classic and private servers is you make a macro that has /sit on every line (until you reach the character cap) like so:
---
Then, when the situation arises, say you're leveling and killing a mob and a warrior charges in on you out of nowhere. You pick a direction to run and hold the movement key, while holding that key, spam that sit macro you made and it will do something rather odd. It essentially lags your game client out so that it no longer reports accurate data to the server. It also stalls your fps. So the game will freeze frame from your perspective, but from the gankers perspective, your character will continue to move in the direction you were going when you started spamming it. It lags you out for however long you continue to spam that macro. Once you stop, your game eventually catches up (depending on the processor in your pc, it could take 2 seconds or 10). From the enemy player perspective, you ran far in a given direction (the lag) and then you suddenly disappeared completely (your pc catching up).
---
It's 100% effective against people that don't know about it and works best against melee based classes because of melee range being so particular. It does not work well with pet classes because your movement will not be fooled by a pet that is sent to attack you. All of the effects like dots on you will still do damage so it's not a perfect get-out-of-ganking free card, but it's super handy for those persistent attackers when you just want to get that quest done asap.
---
if you had a guild back in vanilla, there is a website delicated to let you re-connect with some of your vanilla friends from 14 years ago:  
---
[https://www.vanillafriends.com/](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)  
---
I tried it a manage to connect with a few of the players I used to do dungeon runs with, it is a really great community website, do check it out!!
---
PvP server, no doubt. 
---
Nothing beats meeting the opposition in the open world and having a stare-down. You both look.. and you know he's thinking what you are thinking.. "Are we about to fight, or can I continue my quest? Is he aggressive or peaceful.. focussed on questing right now or ready to rumble.. will be attack if I turn my back and continue farming these mobs?"
---
I find the PvE experience to be tame. Without having to check your surroundings and feeling the danger all around - what's the fun in that? Killing NPCs and easymode it without the thrill? 
---
Well some people like it. I'll take my thrill - even if I hardly ever gank others and just want to progress, it still brings excitement. :)
---
Most likely. Two words we hear in every fucked up situation.
---
One of the few things I think classic *did* better than retail *currently* does, or has done in a long time.
---
See what I mean?
---
This really isn’t a huge issue it also doesn’t affect gameplay so will likely not be fixed. Most people just go afk during flight paths anyway?
---
Big QoL was that addons could post automatically without you clicking that button again and again. So you could push the button and wait a bit while Auctioneer just posted all configured items. Also you could buy any number of stacks with a single click. It took the same time like now, but you could alt-tab or afk meanwhile.
---
Unfortunately it made botting very easy, so that's the reason they removed it, I guess.
---
&gt; Feral tanks also do giga bad threat
---
What? This is completely inaccurate. I've out-threated my MT on a bear OT many times.
---
Yeah if you guys wanna be extra sneaky together, that looks good.
---
Someone pointed out my error already and you are right that 6 months for each phase won't work. But I disagree that 6-7 months for phase 1 and 2 is too long. I am sure that some will fly through the content and be complaining for more but if you shorten the timeframe to satisfy those people you speed through the progression for no good reason. 
---
Why is it a problem on a long timeline to have a long first phase with a short second tacked onto it? People will have more time to farm MC/Ony, and more casual people get a chance to level up and get in on the fun. There is basically no upside to rushing content except for the pvp implementation (as people have pointed out pvp without battlegrounds can't last too long or it would be a nightmare). This is a long term game, not a rush because of an expansion that may or may not ever be made.
---
Horse brother
---
40 mount you literally just talk to someone and learn the spell. its free.
---
I haven't played many mmo's, but Vanilla was really "real". Serious versimilitude but yet not rp.
---
They're mostly healers. Vanilla is different, not every class can top meters. Hunters have generally quite low dps, but you need to bring some into bwl. Feral offtank? Why not, use full on trash packs and if you manage to powershift, you can do better dmg than some classes.
---
why do that when he can do the same with new character he might like
---
I know, and I'm pretty sure there was no point in-between them. Unlike say Camp Taurajo, which required a pit stop at the Crossroads.
---
Instanced world in TBC? Like what? 
---
The only addition was basically arenas (BGs were already instanced in vanilla technically)
---
Troll female: “but who said I like you though”
---
both have the same peak though \*shrug\*
---
What would you rather:
---
A) Have the option to farm 150g/hour, but almost never get invited to premades or raids because the server has an absurd amount of hunters
---
B) Farm 50g/hour but actually get to play your class?
---
Wait what? So the healthstone's healing is tied to the talent as soon as it is created? and they're unique but only as far as the healing amount? that is insane. 
---
Can you downrank it for 3 more healthstones?
---
Gold wedding band.. antique cufflinks
---
They will add the dismount button i heard, dropping you off at the next fp
---
Pimping out your bank alt was the shit.
---
Sounds sus I agree, why would someone who's clearly not at all a fan of wow (don't really see why else you'd quit 2 days after an expansion release, right off the back of vanilla) be on the classic wow sub 3 months before release, it's possible of course just a bit weird..
---
&gt;Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW
---
People keep saying this but it has no basis. They have said it could last all of phase 1 but no further, Phase 1 will more be than 2 weeks. 
---
Layering the way they explined it does very little to the influx of players in a starting zone. 
---
&gt;If you are too much of an insane purist to want any changes at all, classic ain’t for you.
---
That is an insane thing to say. "If you wanted to enjoy this game then classic just isint for you. Its for all the tourists that will be gone in 2 weeks."
---
P sure everyone did it
---
Man its your game time. Do what you want.
---
Actually an interesting thought
---
In retail, if you don’t experience an event or a raid, if you didn’t farm for an item before it was removed, or if you didn’t buy the blizzcon ticket to get into the demo, it’s very likely because you decided not to do it
---
But the beta is just insane luck to get in, or you have to be an “influencer”, to experience something unique. (Kinda funny how some of them ended up where they are now, by using private servers play or info)
---
And if you’re one of the “it’s just beta”, then it’s clearly because you feel different than does who really want it get in, just like those people might not have the same desire for something you really would like, that doesn’t mean that the desire you have for your thing, is more valid than the desire they have for their thing
---
Completely useless because dispells makes them go oom in 5 seconds without having done any damage.
---
100% same...  
---
While thinking Vanilla is never coming back, I was able to just roll with "other games". But now - everything else just feels like a waste of time somehow. What a weird feeling.
---
Private servers don't have an absurd amount of hunters, and the gold farming option is there.
---
To be fair they are probably remembering release talents. I am pretty sure there was a dungeon balance sweep as well when they removed the ability to raid dungeons.
---
It will take some time before it happens, beta has been out for like a week relax.
---
There's nothing to test anyway. I got to level 8 as a gnome mage and haven't played since. No interest in playing until they open up full levelling and/or there's a hard reset on characters.
---
He constantly talks about how good they are in pvp. Just last night they even said “rets so fucking good, Quinn’s going to be pissed when he sees this” while farming WSG
---
Yea healing meters are quite....ofc I watch healing meters and I'm proud when I am on the top. On the other hand, good healers understand, that everyone got his role and assignments. If your people are not dying you're doing it right.
---
Its worse than I expected and I was ready to not play due to layering. Very sad. 
---
I wish we had sharding back honestly...
---
Yes they’ll be honoured
---
You posted the same conflag nightfall build twice
---
Says the druid :p
---
Feral bad.....feels bad you're that ignorant. Ferals can tank most Vanilla raid bosses.  Ferals have higher TPS than warriors.  Ferals aren't always rage starved. Ferals are better vs magic based damage. A feral tanking does more DPS than a Fury OT.  
---
You're bad at Vanilla. Do not listen to this person about ferals.  There's more than what I said.  That's just tanking.  Check Taladrils' Treatise on Druid Tanking in Vanilla.  Don't fully agree with the guy, but he hits most everything on the head.  
---
And with the right effort you can be a viable dps. You can also be good off heals while decursing/cleansing poison due to HotW and a flexible talent build.  
---
Don't listen to any idiots calling feral bad.  They're stuck in 2004 and have failed to learn as theorycrafting advanced.
---
Might be better to compare Patch 8.2 to WoW Classic. Since both aren‘t yet realised. But I‘d guess it would still look similar.
---
Hmm...eeeeeeeeeenteresting. Wtf could be more anti-paladin than DK though? Lock is all I can think of. Is there some kind of archetype that wasn't implemented as a class from the lore or something?
---
Even as someone who will alt tab or go pee during a FP, id like to see some animations added in. Makes it look nicer. FPs are cool when flying over a zone youve never seen before cause it gives a little preview of things to come
---
LMFAO that's hilarious
---
3 on a server means about 100 runs a day, every day, for 2 years. 5 on a server brings that up to 160 runs.
---
Just 1 on a server is about 32 runs per day for 2 years. I'd say that's more likely.
---
Less? Liar. And a dumbass.  He can OT and heal with proper spec and still be able to dps.  Stay in 2004.
---
Optional Xfer to BC, Wrath, and possibly future expacs would be a good idea even if they 'split' the community. I know people who aren't gonna bother with vanilla because of the laughable spec identity among a couple other problems, but would instantly pick up BC or wrath. When it comes to those expacs, just like vanilla, .. #nochanges. I think mostly anything past wrath, which is where wow dropped in quality significantly according to most, could be overhauled or adjusted. 
---
I just don't have a huge issue with flying in zones that were designed around it (like the floating islands of outland, or blades edge/storm peaks). I think it takes away from the 'ground war' aspect of Wpvp for sure, but I don't think its really a big deal, I still remember plenty of wpvp over objectives like quest/crafting resources and instance portals. The grounded portion of Wpvp usually contributes to camping/griefing, just about as often if not more than the 'organic' actual BG style battles. I thought that world bgs like wintergrasp (while they had their own issues), and to a much lesser extent world pvp objectives, had the unrealized potential to fill in this gap, blizzard kind of just dropped the ball going forward over time fleshing out those gameplay principles. Like Tol Barad was a joke, it was like playing ring' around the rosey. 
---
Moving forward from wrath, if they found a better way to implement flying than 'pathfinder' it would be great, they've experimented with some, but really only settled with the 'pathfinder' garbage. Flying is a usually a huge shift in gameplay when there is no Anti-Air/flak cannon style mechanics from players or npcs, it probably influences crafting/d-quests/grinding just as much as Wpvp. It just gives this amazing amount of player agency that you just don't get from flight paths and I think theres potential to keep this positive if they can balance it a bit more for potential new expacs.
---
It changes a significant part of your experience with traveling in the game world.
---
Sure, nothing against that. 
---
What I have against that is that retail players think they’re the majority and that there can’t possibly be an untapped market here. 
---
Classic is popular, so popular that it overturned Blizzards decision to never make it. Think about that. 
---
It’s almost as if people blame nostalgia for everything despite any possible evidence to the contrary.
---
if it affects the immersion I think it's more important than you think... It's like the weather effects, the lighting, all of this adds up to create the global experience. In a game where you don't get to fly at all, flight paths should be the most immersive possible in my view.
---
Well, because beta is all about finding as many bugs as possible? wdym?  
---
He might be tried of playing his paladin now, which is fine, but the level cap is going to increase at some point and maybe then he would find interest in it again.  
---
Unless he wants to play horde, I really don't see the reason why he would delete his character like that.
---
What's the name of that sparkling staff?
---
Some of us do actually like to take in the sights and the sounds of the game but I acknowledge most people probably don't care about these sorts of things.
---
This guy has the right idea. I'd love to see some of those unfinished areas get some content, even if its just a few more BGs or a place to farm mobs and resources to encourage player interaction (pvp).
---
The OP sounds like he just wants a Cataclysm server with "retirement" taking the place of heirloom items and inscription acting as a more complicated way to dual spec.
---
 RemindMe! 95 days
---
i could be totally wrong about this, but my friend who mained ally in vanilla told me that IF had a mailbox closest to the AH out of all the ally cities. idk if thats true or not but I figured that was why
---
this kinda shit gets me GOING. I hate playing the heroes. I've played zerg/undead since pre-bw starcraft and warcraft 2 and i hate the fact that all my friends are rolling alliance but i'm going to play a warlock to retain some of the bad guy ness.
---
roleplay is basically just talking about penises and breasts in a very roundabout way
---
Chill my friend we can disagree without name calling
---
This article is trash lmao
---
Yeah it was annoying. Just some dude moaning in a mic.
---
oh i wont be playing one in classic thats for sure :)
---
No kidding, but the OP is wrong and everyone’s so quick to jump on the bandwagon
---
Because he wanted to play Ret Paladin, but they're garbage and it dawned on him the only viable spec for a Paladin is Holy which he'll never play.
---
Short answer: yes.
---
Well I've been wanting to go to the gym for a while so might as well get back into it and get super healthy before lunch LOL
---
&gt;Well, because beta is all about finding as many bugs as possible?   
---
no its about getting viewers
---
Who ever thought that it wasnt staged really shouldnt be on the internet ... lol
---
Wonder if well be able to tame the pigs with armor like the good old days.
---
"I got to level 8 and haven't played since."  
---
"There's nothing to test anyway."  
---
lol ok.
---
Tbh, it's ez if you group, I did this with my gnome mage in some private.
---
I mean BC heroics were actually 'hard' for the time. They were a huge step up in difficulty from Vanilla dungeons. You were also capped I believe, so you couldn't just 'spam' them to get all the vendor loot.
---
I honestly don't see the trouble with vendor loot at all so long as the currency isn't trivial to obtain.  That and yeah it probably should be the 'best' loot of the bunch, but it really wasn't for the most part.
---
Yeah they confirmed at blizzcon that's how their doing it, the original is just too exploitable. Much less work for them to work backwards from the present than it would be to bring vanilla up to snuff. (It's 8.x though not legion)
---
This should be the kind of thing the beta testers focus on, it will be much more of a pain in the ass to convince blizz to fix things after launch. Right now they're actively working on finding all the inaccuracies and fixing them
---
It's cause max level is 5, so when you're level 5 and do quests it converts to gold. Don't think streamers on beta are/were getting inflated values without being capped
---
WoW Classic is THE best mmorpg of all time so I mean if you're going to start with one start there for sure. I wouldn't really bother with retail wow sadly
---
BC has many problems people tend to overlook or ignore when talking about it. 
---
I loved BC, but looking back at it, especially when comparing it to Classic WoW, its certainly not as good.
---
BC had a new major city that invalidated all the old city hubs.
---
BC invalidated all old content. Something Classic doesn't.
---
It added flying which is obviously a bad thing to do for a multitude of reasons that we now do see and understand.
---
Arenas, while good on paper, made them go for balance choices that where sub optimal, one of the worst ever being resilience.
---
Resilience made PvP a Gear &gt; All thing, something Classic didn't do.
---
BC harmed the faction war by adding shamans to the alliance and paladins to the horde. (also Shattrath).
---
Removed 40 man raiding.
---
Introduced Heroic modes (instead of making dedicated, more difficult new dungeons) and started the multiple difficulty disaster that led into the LFR normal, hero (fill in random difficulty nomenclature)... into  M+ stuff we have today.
---
Did I mention resilience already? Imagine playing against a 450 resilience Sl/SL lock with 15k hp while you're in PvE gear, or s1, s2 gear. He would win pressing one button, standing still, while jacking off with his free hand.
---
Mark Kern is right with his assessment. 
---
Keep what makes Classic so great and built on and around it.
---
Pigeons? Would’ve been better latency than my smoke signals on a west coast server while I’m on the east
---
Hi there,
---
Just wanted to quickly chip in. The stress test had some interesting dynamics. Sure it was nice to log-in see the world again as it used to be and do some leveling.
---
But that wont go away people did not miss out on that part.
---
GMs messing around was fun in a way but as someone who experience the log-in and character creation boss on intial start of the stress test as well as being able to log-in for the last hours of the test. I have to say:  
---
Its all about the community.  Players didnt miss out on anything.
---
It all came down to how you decided to experience WoW Classic. Get to know random people and have a blast together in Azeroth.  
---
Being able to witness Ragnaros or Thrall in SW was nice but it was only so interesting because there were othere players to enjoy the event with them. It wasnt the event by it self.
---
I will remember that during the stress test i met 5 random players from all over the world and I took them on a small expedition to the Elwynn Forest waterfalls. After that I was goofing around in the game following a raid to Gurubashi but got lost in the layers right at the end of the stress test. My final moments were to whisper one of the guys from our expedition (the last person being online at that point) and ask him where he is. We barely managed to met each other in the SW thron room. I could only type BYE and see his response. Next second servers went offline.  
---
So when Classic is released you wont be sad for a split second that you missed out on anything. You will make your own stories that mean the most to you.
---
Hell yeah, man!! I will probably do some alts on PvP servers for sure!
---
Why was the token system bad? It's effectively the normal tier system with RNG protection.
---
it's not worth it at end game, but low levels it can be fun
---
you'll just have to carry around with you different sets of gear in your inventory and switch between during fights
---
You are a gentleman and a scholar. Now do Arcanum for mages :D
---
Yeah, I'm gonna need to stay awake ans sharp for like 3 weeks after launch. That gotta need some preparation! :D
---
Druid has some class specific utility skills that every group wants. Mark of the wild, Innervate, Battle rez.
---
Druids can also fill multiple roles with the same spec. Sure a warrior is a better tank, or a rogue is better dps, but they can't heal at all.
---
Don't worry about picking the "best" class, just pick whatever class you want to play, they are all very effective and desirable for raids.
---
That would be sweet. Imagine MC raid with this shit. I'd run that shit once every day, lol.
---
You're not cool or special for saying you think stupidity is in the majority. By DEFINITION stupidity is not in the majority, otherwise it wouldn't be stupidity would it - don't be stupid
---
then your MT is bad
---
Was thinking the same thing about my dwarf, super dark.
---
Generally speaking this type of thing does not bother me and I would not have noticed if you had not pointed it out.
---
Now I really need this fixed.
---
Thanks for that butt head
---
Would be great to hear some first hand experience as I also joined late Vanilla and didn’t really raid until WotLK.
---
I would play horde except I love Elwynn, Wysall
---
Westfall and Redridge. Not to mention loch modan and dusk wood. 
---
They have so much better starting zones.
---
You dont win as a warrior against full CD rogue lol. Even a subpar rogue can kite you for days. One thing tips didn't have for some reason is bombs which would have helped him out a lot.
---
If you wanna go a little over budget. This monitor is fucking godly for the price. 1440p, freesync, 165hz, and good response time.

My pleasure, twat
---
If I remember correctly, pre-nerf c’thun was unkillable by guilds at the time and it also took quite a bit of time before anyone downed four horseman. But with current knowledge, I also can’t see any of the raid tiers taking that much time.

You're going to have a hard time finding a choice of monitors with those specs and size at that price and you definitely won't find any above 1080p resolution.

Spend a bit more and get [something like this](https://www.rakuten.com/shop/dell/product/s2719dgfsap/?sku=s2719dgfsap) for $255.
---
That's gold Jerry! GOLD
---
Well thats lucky, you'll go back to work just in time for classic release :P
---
Okay fine. But still why couldn't he have kept his paladin for the sake of testing? You never know when you might need to test something.  
---
Besides he could've at least send his gold and stuff to his new character so he would at least have some sort of headstart on that.
---
I'd love a TBC Classic (separate from the vanilla Classic) with flying disabled and the necessary adjustments made, if any.
---
Yeah... I've raided fairly "semi hardcore" throughout the last couple of expansions, but the prep work for vanilla raiding is ALOT diffrent.
---
Hi, OP. I would suggest that you try BFA as well. Vanilla and BFA are very, very different. They're opposites in many ways. You might end up liking BFA more, so it's worth trying both. A sub will let you play both of them.
---
Reading the comments would give you a hint. It's a joke
---
15 years hasn’t even changed your childish ways
---
THIS! Along with professions meaning something, the economy will also be healthy! Hell, I'm actually excited to pick up 2 gathering professions and sell on the auction house! And buy armor and weapons and potions and find an enchanter to give me +2 intellect to my bracers all before I hit 60 because being level 25 is relevant.
---
I have wow tattoos and it still amazes me to this day how many people who dont play games at all know exactly where they're from.
---
Totally agree with you! Also from healing pov feral tank receives a more stable dmg that makes it easier to predict for healers.
---
There are multiple feral tank speccs making it viable to swap gear and just heal!
---
The class itself is amazing and gives very much room for flexibilty for raids aswell for „solo“ stuff, no matter if you go 5mans or just farm stuff!
---
Chuck norris doesnt cause wars. He finishes them!
---
Assuming you want the true vanilla experience, try this one
---
https://www.cnet.com/products/samsung-syncmaster-955df-crt-monitor-19/
---
And Tauren has the plus of a larger health pool.  You're also very valuable for your threat generation.  Honestly, it's not a massive enough difference unless you're doing the no life that high end guilds will do. 
---
I'm going Night Elf. I was one in Vanilla.  Stayed feral Vanilla to Legion.  Don't let people discourage you. My only advice is to be flexible. Sure, you can technically stay cat dps for most of the content, but it's not optimal for your raid. Some fights you'll be better switching to resto gear to help with cleansing and removing curses. On other fights you're a great tank.  It has been found we can main tank most of Vanilla WoW's bosses.  We aren't always optimal and it'll be better to dps or heal those fights until you most likely have it on farm and out gear it. 
---
Be prepared for hours farming Gnomer, collecting mats for consumables, repeatedly doing the same dungeon for that random enchant armor piece, etc.  We are the ultimate tryhard spec in Vanilla imho. To be of the best use to our raids we spec so that we can play all three roles in the raid and carry gear along with consumables for these roles. 
---
And it's 2019 and not 2004-2007. Theorycrafting has advanced.  A feral won't be MT for the server first guild or a chart topping dps.  However, a feral can be a viable and valuable part of the average raid. Just don't plan on having more than 1-2 per raid.
---
You could get a job, that would help pass the time
---
To be fair the purpose of the stress test was to log in and stress the servers, not find bugs.
---
I’m not saying get rid of blocking, unit boxes need to be more reasonable
---
*I am summoning a horse that roxes!*
---
Assuming you cant get the 8 piece would trustrike be better?
---
You seem pretty dead set on injecting your opinion as fact and ignoring/dismissing the actual facts. God bless.
---
The stress test is just to overload a single server to see how it performs at high load. Not necessarily get an idea of how many players will be playing overall. 
---
They do have early character creation which should help get an idea of how many will be playing.
---
[https://wowmodelviewer.net/new/](https://wowmodelviewer.net/new/)
---
Dormammu, I’ve Come To Bargain.
---
I don't think so.
---
They will probably let us die from hype.
---
To be fair this really seemed like a client-side issue. And private server clients are the same as retail vanilla clients.
---
Eh, he's a HC SSF PoE player. He likely doesn't give a fuck, I don't blame him. Beta is pointless right now.
---
Since we're playing post weapon speed normalization, this is a bad idea.
---
I think about making rogue as my main but I've never played rogue on fresh server and I have no clue if it's good idea and how rogues manage on new servers.
---
Be prepared for a lot of standing around
---
I'll take a look at the guide, thanks!
---
My goal isn't to top any meters of any sort and I fully expect that to never be the case. I'm however willing to bring along additional consumes and gear sets in order to be useful in ways that might not be visible on any graphs.
---
Upvoted for the use of the word twat.
---
When I was raiding, we did 4 nights a week of around 4.5 hours and I had to do around 1 hour of farming/preparing most days.
---
This was progression for AQ40 when we had BWL and MC on farm status.
---
Note, progression really ended up being the two nights and the other two farming/bwl/world bosses/MC/alt gearing.
---
Some guilds may do a really big session all afternoon/night Saturdays and then you can to 2 nights during the week and still progress.
---
It’s also down to making sure everyone knows the fights and are totally maxing out their potential each raid.
---
Virtually any texture, animation or effect doesn’t effect gameplay but you can’t say they aren’t important to the game.
---
Yeah I can't believe this is real, sorry.
---
Alliance bias. Sad
---
According to half this sub, if you have one ret paladin you’re guaranteed a wipe every time at Vael.
---
Tauren hitboxes were bigger until wotlk.
---
This affected pvp (hitting or getting hit through LOS/pillars) as pve (mainly tanking) as well.
---
Lol yes, on a class that counters a warrior you would beat a warrior. Fuck me this is tough explaining. Warriors are trash solo against anything that has CD's or a slow. Few things tips should have had / used are bombs, Pots, and anti poisons but almost no one just carries that stuff around at level 30.
---
depending on the boss damage/health i guess  
---
if its as close to original as possible you wont need to farm much pots, flasks etc. because players are much better today and would deal with stuff more easily
---
Explain?
---
I def was. https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/whisperwind/Rude+Awakening/rating.tier21
---
Not a good as your times with Unlucky, but def in top 1000 players. I was apart of the 1%. Guess that makes me apart of a shitty guild right according to you? 
---
Also on topic of 4000 guilds killing Argus. Argus was the last boss of the expac, I'd certainly hope that more guild would be able to kill it. Especially with how long the wait is before the next expac. That's usually the case. 
---
Not sure what you're trying to prove here. I still don't get your stance. Like you're trying to prove i'm some shit player or something. I can see why your first response to mine got so many downvotes. You can be a decent player but doesnt make you a decent person.
---
Itll be fine when tanks get beefy
---
Not a good comparison unless the no changes crowd is willing to see updates later on.  OSRS was dying before some radical changes like the GE were added, and tons of new gear and content has been added since its release. It's an entirely separate development path.
---
 Hi there,
---
Just wanted to quickly chip in. The stress test/beta has some interesting dynamics. For me, it was nice to log-in see the world again as it used to be and do some leveling during the stress test.
---
GMs messing around was fun in a way but as someone who experience the log-in and character creation boss on intial start of the stress test as well as being able to log-in for the last hours of the test. I have to say:
---
In hindsight, I know that I did not miss out on anything that happend during the intial hour of the stress test (C'thuun and stuff). 
---
Because for me it is and was all about the community.
---
Getting to know random people and have a blast together in Azeroth was worth more to me than being able to witness Ragnaros or Thrall in SW. It wasnt the event by itself.
---
My most fond memory of the stress test is that I met 5 random players from all over the world and I took them on a small expedition to the Elwynn Forest waterfalls (above northshire). After that I was goofing around in the game following a raid to Gurubashi but got lost in the layers right at the end of the stress test. My final moments were to whisper one of the guys from our expedition (the last person being online at that point) and ask him where he is. We barely managed to met each other in the SW thron room. I could only type BYE and see his response. Next second servers went offline.
---
So when Classic is released you wont be sad for a split second that you missed out on anything. Everything is ahead of you and you will make your own stories that mean the most to you in World of Warcraft.
---
Member berries
---
Not in the old system, Mounts are the expensive part. Guess they don't want everyone running around with every single mount.
---
Oh yeah if you can keep that up consistently, you'd have no problem being on constant progression content. Whether it'll get you into top tier competitive guilds I can't say, but you're looking fine. 
---
SS farming is over hyped, it's like maybe 20 mins a week and it's zero if you are already farming something else each week.
---
I mean this is of course if you don't get super lucky and get Baron mount or a ZG mount when they come out.
---
I rotate from day shifts to night shifts every 2 weeks, it's going to be a complete pain to find a guild that accommodates; also work weekends.  So for me, it doesn't matter if it's NA or EU so that's one upside.
---
Going to hate missing 2 weeks worth of gaming, will find behind so bad, won't be able to keep up in loot, but I guess slow and steady can work.
---
Monkey is the best warrior in the world lowkey
---
washed ashore is intended to not despawn iirc. Other world quest objectives  vary in whether they despawn or not. Some did and others didn't. It was very inconsistent.
---
39-49 is not a bracket. it's a level 39 twink or a level 49 twink, separate brackets. not sure if you knew this.
---
Then go play a private server, idiot
---
The only thing toxic about this place is that even the mention that maybe classic isnt completely perfect and that balance whine will begin is enough to get a bunch of people throwing abuse.
---
Lots of commonly used words end with `n't`, I find myself doing it a lot too
---
I see. Hopefully their calculations will be at least close to the actuals numbers so we can have a smooth launch.
---
Yeah i was indeed expecting a reaction like this again, or massive downvotes cause i guess that's how reddit does it's thing, but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw your comment. 
---
Really well said, and i agree completely. Even with the giant mess that happened at launch in vanillas time, it became the most successful MMORPG by a mile, and once the storm subsides and people play without the first technical drawbacks, everyone will be so caught up anyway they forget about what had just happened because they are enjoying themselves.
---
I really hope that Blizzard will see your point of view, because really as you said there's no need to fix this just because they can. I get it, it's enticing to wanna use your modern tech magic.. but no. Not in classic.  They put modern expectations on a game which point it is that it's a portal back in time to a wholesome classic experience, good and bad, with no rush and no tech shenanigans that could turn it into something else entirely just for the sake of having a bit more comfort at the start, at the expense of an authentic classic experience for potentially months  in the worst case, and a memory of launch that will last maybe forever. 
---
And that memory of classic launch will have layering and it's effects be a part of it. Not worth it in my eyes.
---
Well, there's still a bit of time to get the point across. Or not. I hope it's the former!
---
Could you tell the game? Always interested to see what mmos come up with.
---
Although I work 7 days a week, it's a Saturday and most do not.
---
But muh no changes
---
Tauren deep.
---
Recruit a casual mom player who enjoys alchemy and cooking
---
So is dating!
---
Every class does fine. Play what you want, just be prepared to waste months ganking people in stv instead of leveling.
---
On Pservers casual guilds raid 6-8 hours a week and hardcore guilds raid 3-4 hours a week.
---
Absolutely
---
Right? You can't broadcast your location to the world in a competitive game and then expect people not to use that information. That's just stupid.
---
You're joking, the animations are STILL not there?! For crying out loud
---
Many thanks!
---
What difference does that make? Plenty of games had their own category before release. Look at PUBG, DayZ, etc. I don't know how many games are released under Early Access nowadays.
---
Good 'ol  4:3 times!
---
I don't think it should be designed around the cutting edge. Vanilla WoW was not.
---
1-60 is a good 260 hours. For the majority, thats going to take over 3 months. Gearing up in blues for Ony and MC is going to take another month or two. That would only leave 1 month to actually clear the content, which is pretty short.
---
I remember watching the episodes while waiting during the patch days on wednesday, great times!
---
The moustache of a true champion.
---
In the stress test I unlocked stormwind &amp; westfall flight points, I couldn't use the westfall flight point to fly to stormwind (because i hadn't unlocked the flight point at goldshire).
---
It works as it should.
---
Not to mention the tourists. Absolutely nothing wrong with being a tourist, but blizz shouldn't make long term decisions like server numbers based on temporary factors like that
---
You mean charge which cant be used in combat yeah? 
---
Or do you mean intercept which can be used in combat and he did but still had the poison on him making it impossible to get near the rogue. Intercept also has a 30 some second CD IIRC. 
---
Heres literally the only thing the warrior could have done, Been an engi and brought bombs to keep the rogue from moving for .5 seconds, Had a stack of anti poison from first aid on him and stacked up on consumables and potions (I dont think any of the useful potions are usable that low level though) maybe rended a bit more. 
---
Warriors dont win 1v1 against any class with a slow, Even less chance of winning against a rogue as they open on you rather than you being able to get that 10 rage from the charge which is how you get your first rend off. Trust me you play a warrior in classic and watch every other class with a slow /lol at you as you stumble towards them.
---
That's hella racist bro. Like i know they can be loud and obnoxious be they are people too.
---
It's not about making the zones feel populated. It's making sure that there are no dead servers a few months after release. Layering essentially serves the same purpose as having multiple servers that are designated for merging later on, think of them as Laughing Skull #1, Laughing Skull #2, etc. This way a community/groups can form between these "servers" as they gradually merge and people can keep their names.
---
Sign up for dating websites. Some women will be interested in you, just not the kind you want.
---
The idea of stream sniping is moronic to me. This comes with the territory.
---
Anytime a streamer gets killed "oh he must be stream sniping" get ready for STVietnam guys
---
????? There’s no flight path at goldshire.
---
So everyone basically gets free epic on their alts once AV launches?  Sounds weird to me.
---
I was doing the same then I fucked up my leg. So now it's no gym or classic! Time to go through my steam list and just finally check off stuff from humble bundles
---
You’re 100% correct. I will be one of those people that afk during FPs, but I would like the old feel back for when I am present at times.
---
There is no FP between them. Org-Tanaris is a direct flight and it's always been that way. It's just really, really long.
---
This isn’t an option. You better play it. Don’t make me find you.
---
Whops, forgot that, but still, i could not fly from westfall -&gt; stormwind.
---
&gt;**stupid** Lacking in intelligence or exhibiting the quality of having been done by someone lacking in intelligence.
---
&gt;**intelligence** Capacity of mind, especially to understand principles, truths, facts or meanings, acquire knowledge, and apply it to practice; the ability to comprehend and learn
---
Not sure what "DEFINITION" you're referring to that applies to anything to do with majority or statistics for that matter.
---
I think you’ll hit your 144 if your resolution is reduced. Honestly, latency plays such a huge factor in WoW that it’s not even worth running that high of a refresh rate. Max your graphics out and run at a nice high res @85hz
---
Back when I played on one of those shady servers we usually raided from 19:00 - 23:00 of we wanted to do both aq and bwl in one night, but just doing 1 raid on one night was less than 2 hours usually. Mc took less than an hour and up to 1 hr and 30m on a bad day. Bwl usually around 1hr and 30m, AQ usually took at least 1hr and 20m. 
---
The consumables you had to farm could take up to 2 hours a week if you're an easy raider. But my farming was usually filled with wpvp and random fuckery.
---
This will be the longest 93 days of my life
---
You should have been able to. That’s a connected flight path and completely normal for 1.12.
---
It’ll be much better now because mobs and other items won’t be popping in at the last minute anymore.
---
nah every toon has to buy their own training and mount.
---
20 days minimum
---
I actually haven’t been subscribed to it and I got the email.
---
Unfortunately I don’t have my computer with me to download it
---
&gt; **Players finally enjoy the process, and don't dwell on the goal.** 
---
Well duh. The "goal" is to be where everyone else is and when everyone is still leveling themselves, that's right there. 
---
Fast forward a year or two, people ask for F R E S H servers or, in the case of retail, they asked for catch-up mechanics. Because the "goal", the bulk of the playerbase, is far away. 
---
The catch up craze didn't come from nothing and is not some conspiracy to maliciously invalidate other people's work. Lots of people simply don't like playing a MMO as a single-player game for dozens of levels. Shocking, I know.
---
Let people know what kind of gear you are after before the run or when you recruit them. It would help if you focus on 1 type of gear instead of all in one run. That means you need to do more runs, but that might be better than just grabbing everything.
---
You can say for a few runs that you will roll on healer gear, so DPS won't be upset and you can find a healer that's willing to roll with you or alternate loot drops. You can also get a pally healer that wants to roll on plate tanking gear. After that you can say you are rolling on DPS leather gear then at least mages/locks will be happy to join.
---
It breaks down when you want to roll on everything at once. If no one needs an item piece though, then that's fine. It's best to make friends and come to an agreement and play with them through all the dungeons if possible.
---
Does the mount having animations have an impact of npcs/object popping in as you land?
---
Were you able to play it even without subscription?
---
*But* as a horde druid you can set your hearth to grom'gol, which you'd likely do anyway as it has the easiest access to both UC and Org zepplins, and easy flights to BRD/MC. So you'd be a very short flight to BB.
---
When i start playing classic, it will be thousand (instant) noodles for me!
---
No.  And the correct answer would of been most gaming companies like blizzard have switched to a hybrid model.

---
The level 30 meta actually existed in retail!
---
For a few months after release of battlegrounds, the level brackets ended at the 10. Aka 21-30, 31-40 etc. During those months, all I did was play wsg on my level 30 rogue and it was a blast. No mounts made individual move speed shine. Level 30 skills like feign death and kidney shot were unexpected by the low levels and huge boosts for the 30. 
---
I loved that period of vanilla, and honestly wouldn’t have leveled my character past 30, but they changed the brackets when AB released, so all of a sudden I had to get 39. And honestly, there was nothing quite the same as the huge power boost you got at that 10th level through new skills and talents, and seeing the beta play out like I remember my time at 30 is a beautiful thing to watch.
---
Yeah you are right, it was just the last place I saw it in that I remembered
---
Tayler youre wrong
---
Would you start Star Wars at the end of the beginning?
---
The point is that there isn't any flight points you need to unlock in between Gadgetzan and Orgrimmar. 
---
So just knowing Gadgetzan and Orgrimmar Fp was, actually, enough.
---
I could listen to you both argue about finally fantasy for awhile I think.

Btw you’re both wrong /s

*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
How hard can it be for Twitch to implement? I think there's something else at play here. They'll wait for both games to be at peak interest to seperate; probably near Classic's release and/or BFA's 8.2 patch. They don't want viewership split in two halves, when they can keep them combined and consistently be in the top 5 games currently being watched.
---
They plan to increase it gradually! They don't want people to grind to 60 and skip most of the mid game content. That way people that want to reach cap can do it fast and then play/test the game. From a testing perspective it is way better than opening the whole game from the beginning.
---
Curious...might that video have been from Beta/PTR? It shows having been " Published on Dec 10, 2006 "...but January 16, 2007 was the release date for The Burning Crusade.
---
Must be a recent bug as during the stress test i couldn't fly from Booty Bay to Ironforge without learning the Stormwind flight path.
---
As much as I'm sure I'll love wPVP in classic, I'd be bummed if the game never had flying again.  It was awesome to see the world from the sky.  I remember pvping a bunch in BC.
---
Perhaps a middleground could work - Important areas, towns/cities/raid entrances could have flying disabled, or weather patterns can make it so sometimes some zones have no flying.  Perhaps there's a mount 'rest' system which prevents indefinite flying, so it's more like a long-term travel cooldown.
---
I was going to mention the raid tiers. As a casual now days world quests are more rewarding than a normal raid... Makes sense
---
I agree with that. They are going overboard cuz streamers. I do believe there will be world firsts in classic. Ony and Rag will be first.
---
Or OP did not play since the implementation of achievements
---
I love we have clips like this and tons of others detailing the huge amount of bugs in the game, then you turn around and still see tinfoil  hat conspiracy theories about how the game is ready to be released but they are just holding back because 8.2 is comming for BFA.
---
The game isn't ready yet guys, they are working hard to fine tune everything. The same ones complaingin that it's releasing at the end of summer, as if that is some sort of broken promise, and the ones that are saying that they are just holding the game back for 8.2, are the same ones that would be trashing Blizzard massively had they actually released the game with all these bugs.
---
Streamers should just stream with a 1 minute delay ;)
---
At this point, the devs probably just want to see how Classic does first. 
---
They don't want to come up with this long manifesto, then the game bombs and they have to completely change direction.
---
There are also subsequent stress tests with increased level cap to level 10.  The next one being this Wednesday.  They are trying to gauge how layers will be implemented and where the boundaries should be. 
---
I’m pretty sure Asmongold and his army of 50k followers traveling across the continent to Gurubashi Arena completely skewed the results of the test.
---
Id take the girl that likes me loo
---
Undercutting your competition, while making a fashion statement.
---
ok i will be fair, i have seen one decent melee hunter who used things like 2x dragons call and wing clip spam to deal with warrior and high armor targets effectivly.
---
And first 60! Don’t forget it!
---
I think it was added in WOTLK.
---
No. I’m talking about how the rides will be much more immersive now without the popping and unpopping of things on your screen.
---
Terms like stupid, smart, intelligent, or anything in that area at all, are relative. If everyone is stupid, then nobody is, because that's the norm, the average. Einstein is described as intelligent because he is much more intelligent than the average person. If the average person was Einstein, Einstein would no longer be described as intelligent, would he?
---
Raids will be cleared in &lt;3 days. They are easy by today's standards.
---
rouges
---
Ah I gotcha, and do agree :D
---
The fuck, those flight masters lied to me.
---
Yeah I've been playing on a pserver to ride me over and am leveling herb/alc.
---
In live if you level alc while leveling yourself all the options you make early are basically vendor trash. In classic you fucking drink those potions. *7* int? Yes please.
---
Mortified
---
Ferahgo and his videos.
---
Honestly you aren’t missing much got level 30 in under 30 hours and really ran out of stuff to do. Kinda boring now.
---
I remember this place as a kid who constantly made new emails to play WoW trials because my parents didnt wanna pay for subscription. I'm hyped for classic now that I can pay the sub on my own.
---
I’m pretty sure the biggest time investment will be leveling to 60. After that it’s mostly farming mats for consumables during the week and then just forming a raid on raid night (typically 2-4 hours).
---

If you like widescreen monitors, I can recommend the LG 29UM68-P. It has FreeSync which makes frame rate ditches really smooth, the aspect ratio feels like being in a cinema. First game I've played on it was Shadows of Mordor, I could smell the Urukh blood :-)

Lucky you.

you haven't seen his grotesque keyboard then

Lol yeah i knew that, i guess i just typed/worded it weird.  didnt wanna type out 30-39 &amp; 40-49
---
There are only a handful of areas unreachable without a flying mount, and all of them are reachable with a flight path.
---
No one cares about Classic being a replica of Vanilla WoW?
---
Since when?
---
It was a part time job before you got a place on farm. After that we could do MC, BWL and Onyxia in 2.5 hours, most of it spent traveling.

Here for referrence: https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/whisperwind/Rude+Awakening/rating.tier21
---
So there is a reason they call it the 1%
---
M: Argus the Unmaker	1748 (3.80%) &lt;--WoWprogress APG pre/post nerfs included.
---
1748 Guilds killed Mythic Argus according to WoW Progress, so 4000 guilds and the 20% you mentioned is imaginary. 
---
If you're trying to prove a point at least know the statistics or do the research lol
---
autorunning, default key is num lock
---
Seems odd of him to specify "if you're in a starter zone" if it also applied elsewhere.
---
Imagine the pain for blizzard to see their main game with \~1000 viewers and classic having 50k ;)
---
ESO
---
Code, yes. But it very likely wouldn't be database. Code has to be manually implemented, whereas the database should be a 1:1 copy.
---
Be glad people like this won’t be playing with us.
---
I believe it was, yes. But given that I did the quest myself and regularly sat in Undercity listening to it being played, I am 100% sure that she was still a Nelf model through TBC. The other picture may have been something after 1.12.1 or a prototype of WotLK later on, since I frankly don't recall seeing it. But my memory of a single window of time between patches is unsurprisingly less complete than of the subsequent many months listening to one of my favorite songs in the Warcraft universe.
---
Depends on your guild, with your raiding experience you could probably get a spot in a hardcore guild and for them it's a cruise through the content. It takes much more time for the mid-tier guilds because out of the 40 people you need to raid there's always someone who is shit at the game or has brain farts causing wipes. Also the constant replacement of people means you have to explain tactics again and again. 
---
You should probably set aside two nights a week for raids, we're talking 3-5 hour raids or so. Then you will probably do an extra raid day for the older content. So if you do AQ on Wednesday and progress Naxx on Sunday you will probably still need some BWL pieces so you do that on another day. Eventually your guild will probably drop AQ entirely and just focus on Naxxramas. There are 15 bosses in there with a decent amount of trash so it takes a while.
---
Lol, didn't get a ton of big crits and instant casts at level 1 so classic sux! Need big flashing buttons to keep these noobs entertained
---
Surely not in Cata, I stopped playing mid-Wrath and I remember the opponents flag carrier showing on map after a some minutes. If it wasn't in 1.12 it must've been added in TBC.
---
Yuck. What a mediocre opinion.
---

My favorite thing about Necrosis was the audio queue you get from a Nightfall proc. "SHADOW TRANCE!!!"

You dont remember or you werent paying attention because WoW forums were practically defined by endless balance whine fests, abuse of Ghostcrawler, accusations that the A team had left WoW to make Starcraft/Diablo/Tetris, endless BLIZZZZ????? posts where a guy got one shot by some guy and posted the damage log on the forum, and huge arguments in and around classes.  The vicious arguments over blessings and totems on PvE forums were particularly fun.
---
Then there were the vast quantities of abuse heaped at any player who played their own way.
---
Does that mean the game wasnt fun?  Of course not.  I loved vanilla WoW, though I dont think I fetishised it quite like you and others did.
---
So question is, am I right about my description of the discussion surrounding the game, or wrong?  We tell jokes about paladins being a masturbation aide but they were not jokes.
---
A ex warlord Horde mage was playing against Mcconnel Staysafe etc, someone joined his stream and numerous times they called him by name and  were super toxic. Someone also spammed his stream with bots while he was playing.
---
It depends on the change. Basic QoL things aren't going to lead to depravity, so I could see things like the "dismount at next stop" thing staying in, for example. But the slippery slope argument has rightfully been used when people suggest things like buffing a certain spec, because you can bet your life savings on the fact that if one class got changes, the whole community would erupt in demands for other classes and various aspects of the game like itemization.
---
There won’t really be progression outside of naxx and maybe cthun,  everything else will be 1 shot
---
they are in WSG wtf are you talking about
---
Is this the way it is in BFA?  I wonder where this version of pathing even came from.
---
https://wowmodelviewer.net/new/
---
Jesus christ, making shit up for likes on the forums, yikes. what kind of wolves is he fighting in level 2-3 that he has to use 4 fireballs lmao
---
Ah, thanks for clarifying.
---
Same here.  I'll be a try hard when I'm on, but my time is limited so I'll be casual in many ways.  I'm happy with the possible balance
---
U dont really use ss apart from summoning pets and people plus healthstones, most of the abillities dont need ss. And warlock is probably the strongest pvp class in vanilla
---
Useful access to stress test 👌🏻
---
its a class that requires a lot more effort just to be on the same level as other classes. if played to its full potential, its not a bad class at all. theres so much more to the game than choosing a class soley based on raid dmg meters
---
***DAE?!***
---
***Am I the only one?!***
---
Dont try bfa if you want to play an actual mmorpg. Wait for classic OP! Any launch (server issues not included) of a good mmorpg is one of the best gaming experiences you will get.
---
That's a good start.
---
Main tanks have the highest gear requirement. Tons of guild effort needs to be poured into them to make progress through content that a weaker tank would just die/lose threat to.
---
As such, they're effectively the cornerstone of the guild. If they leave, it can be guild ending. So, many guilds will have the guild leader, raid leader, or officer who is close friends with GL/RL be main tank to minimize the chance they'd leave. That's why it's hard to get a MT slot, on top of skill/time/gear/luck.
---
OH NO YOU DIDN'T!!!111one
---
NAH AH!
---
ahahahha
---
It's so bad. I love it.
---
If you want the Ms in your mmo then yes.
---
This guy has 845 achievement points, he's never played vanilla lol
---
So first it's "by DEFINITION" but now you're having to redefine it to be right. Okay.
---
Someone from their group spammed his stream with bots during the game. while Mcconnel called him out by name claiming no one was a fan of him referring to his stream.
---
Good he has bfa. Stay there scrub
---
I'm one of the #nochanges purists, and I'm fine with whatever was in vanilla, even if I remember it differently. the reason why I'm a #nochanges purist isn't because I want to have the exact same experience again (wouldn't be possible either way), it's because whatever made vanilla into what it was should be protected. And I don't trust anyone (players or devs) to be the all-knowing god to make the right calls on what to change and what to keep.
---
Well when you post it in General, sure you're going to get a bunch of likes.
---
They have a lot of nice PvP abilities but it's mostly in small scale skirmishes. They are very good at defending flags and bases. Also paired with a warlock they can quickly burst down one target at a time. There's a macro where you can get 5 stacks of shadow weaving up almost immediately and then a mind burst, shadowbolt and shadowburn will kill most targets. Very fun!
---
Title game on point 👌
---
From memory, I think it made a pretty big difference, but I never did any precise testing. I searched for any kind of test, and I found a video of someone testing how good human warlocks can detect invis, but it's undoubtedly from a private server so... it's not 100% valid.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smk0Dqq0x-I
---
There's also a bit in World of Roguecraft episode 2 (19 mins into the video) where he demonstrates that in PvP, there's very little time for opponents to react even when you approach head on.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbINgb673JM
---
So, in my opinion, MoD is mostly nice in solo PvE, where it allows you to take a faster path to a mobs back, and it's also useful for certain dungeon stealth runs. In PvP it's mostly a QoL talent; moderately useful, great to have if you like sneaking around places you shouldn't be, like enemy cities for example.
---
TL;DR I like MoD quite a lot, but its value is questionable.
---
To be fair every class just covers before all the quality of life stuff a mage has. Warlock is really insane though, pretty broken in pvp
---
Thats more than enough time.  Actual raiding time isnt the problem, its all the preparation and getting buffs ready and pots.  My guild raids 9hrs a week and has cleared naxx.
---
I work as a law enforcement officer here in Michigan. My patrol shift is 9 to 6 a.m. . I also go to school full-time for cyber-security but thanks for the advice LOL
---
Sad? Why do you need these people anyway. The more to take the bait, the better. You won't miss these in the trade chat, trust me.
---
Just so nobody is misled by your rather ambiguous statement (not saying you did it intentionally though): Blizzard has _not_ said a word about this. There is no indication that they are even considering it.
---
Can't wait to see you in the picket line in front of Amazon HQ to call out Bezos on him crushing smaller businesses.
---
What's that? You're only a warrior on your keyboard? Ok.
---
Seriously though, this is the ***internet.*** Deal with it.
---
Fireball has a damage range of 14-23. Level 2 wolves have 63 hp. It is likely you need 4 Fireballs (rank 1, rank 2 is learned at level 6) to kill one. He's not wrong. Parts of classic were mediocre, and by today's standards I would argue even more elements of classic will be mediocre. That's not to say it isn't a fun experience.
---
ah that makes sense now, cheers :)
---
Not a huge fan of this guy, but those were on point.
---
I put on a little bit of weight over the last couple years I'm not that bad but I definitely could slim up a bit
---
Fastest to r14 I think is like 3 months and then you need to be bracket 1 each week
---
3. Banging chick on stream (you see the little payo ofc)
---
Crossrealm BGs were added in 1.12.0. A good addition.
---
Such a beautiful and well made book!
---
How viable is pyroclasm talent in pvp /pve? Does the 26% chance Mean that each tic of hellfire and Rain of chaos has that proc chance, or is it across the entire channel?
---
Yeah I'm off Tuesdays and Wednesdays so I work the weekends except for one every month.
---
Too bad we won't be able to ride them in Classic
---
Can everyone stop posting pictures of their old game manuals?
---
SO HOT
---
It proves that you lack a sense of humor
---
It's a slow and tedious time sink.
---
If you like oldschool RPG sure, otherwise, there are way better games out there.
---
I see what you're saying but there's no way he was that unlucky with damage on his fireballs all the time? I'm 100% sure it took 3 fireballs from me during the stress test. Also isn't he greatly exxagerating that he gets oom and has to use melee to finish it off?
---
the content on this post is revolving around streamers, and not classic wow or anything in it, really. gonna be a no from me, dawg
---
I would be also interested in level capping, but removing instance and instance gear level requirements. So, if you can kill Herod at lvl30, you could wear the gear dropped by him.
---
Yes. Just keep in mind that this iteration of WoW is going to be on the more challenging side of MMO's. The whole purpose behind this "regression" is that players have been demanding that blizzard return to the design philosophy they loved. With a fair bit of resistance I might add. The success of Classic will be a testament to what players are actually wanting out of MMO's. It will be healthy for the genre as a whole I feel.
---
If you have an example of one, I can doublecheck. I know the starting zone quests are showing their correct reputation gains now.
---
While you are leveling is the best time to secure your tank raidspot.  If you hit 60 and have not made connections, then you could try farming prebis tank gear before applying.  But i would recommend joining a guild as a dps but state clearly you would like to offtank.  Its much faster to prove your worth and to get dps gear, so at least you get some raid experience.  Dont be scared, tanks will always find a spot.
---
Great thing of you my man. Thanks for doing this. I dont remember if this was a thing, but a timer on spellstone cd would be dope. It is one of the most useful parts of warlock kit in pvp, and you will be spending soulshard like crazy on them, even more important than hs against casters.
---
"It's the game I played as a kid, so it's the best game ever".
---
Well, them re-releasing Vanilla is the product of a vocal community and I think that Blizzard is, once again, closely monetoring the community and having additional content in the spirit of Vanilla would be tremendous for the game itself and maybe the MMO genre.
---
Reviving the notion that you have to earn your rewards and stepping away from all those psychological changes in the game that are supposed to keep us interested by instant gratification backfires completely.
---
There is a reason for the rise of Soulsborn or difficult indie games in the last 10 years and Blizzard should cater to this community, because we are getting bigger.
---
They’re not making as many servers as you’d expect.  They want huge high pop servers with layering to accommodate the tourism, and as that fades they can remove the layering and have healthy server populations.  Ion stated this specifically in a recent interview.
---
Spirit is irrelevant unless mage is expected to wand for an extensive anount of time. So, sp gear is for both mages and locks, stam and spirit distribution is irrelevant for the loot council
---
They shouldn’t add zones or levels but bring the assets in; SSC in wetlands, tempest keep in alters mountains, black temple in Desolace; bring all the dungeons, make them level 60 tuned, have  1 difficulty, and spread them around the world
---
I like the idea of adding caves that lead down to death wing etc
---
The average damage range of rank 1 Fireball is 18.5. On average you need 3.4 Fireballs to kill a level 2 wolf, but obviously you can't cast 0.4 of a Fireball, so you either cast 3 and melee, or you cast 4. Regarding the OOM scenario? Hmm, that is harder to say. It is obvious you cannot chain cast in classic like you are able to in retail, this is, I can only assume, why he says things are mediocre. It was very poor design to have a caster than relies on melee when that melee damage is attached to a weapon skill that the caster isn't likely to be levelling as they level up.
---
This would be similar to Blizzard taking away vanilla weather effects.
---
It cannot stand.
---
All the top comments are wrong. The video isn’t candid but it IS a reenactment of something that actually happened.
---
I also tested this out yesterday morning and got the same results (no rep decay), however after the WSG patch later in the day, I ran some more tests and rep decay is definitely in effect now. You can see my results here:
---

---
Is there any more unlikeable streamer than tips?
---
To slap the commoners clearly
---
Beautiful
---
A higher resolution then 1080p isnt really doable for you I think, so I would stick with that.
---
The difference in price between a 24 144hz and a 27 144hz isnt that big, with the right deal its even the same sometimes, so a downgrade isnt really that necessary there.
---
There are monitors that have both 27inch 144hz for $200, so if you want to spend that you can.
---
Less then 100 fps looks good on a 144hz panel too (especially with an AMD card and a Freesync Monitor for example, Gsync is too expensive), so its not like you would have a disadvantage for going higher hz.
---
I agree completely.
---
25 man raids are superior to 40 man raids. The main problem was the introduction of different difficulty levels combined with warforging/titanforging.
---
There should be no way to gear up that easily and even outgearing higher difficulties.
---
looks like a child molester
---
Because most people won't play classic for its superior rpg element... They just want to feel its 2004 again, and they won't get that feeling if other players are allowed to toggle on HD models, even if they won't be able to see them themselves (stupid af imo).
---
But anyway for some reason blizz decided they could give us HD grass and particle density but not models, so whatever, at this point they're not going to change that.
---
I wouldn't worry too much though, the HD models are still in the data files so I'd bet it won't take the modding community long to come up with a way to display them.
---
Feuer frei or something was used a lot. Maydie comes to mind.
---
yes, lets hate ppl that dont like the game. how dare they?
---
everyone should be like ME! why dont they like what i like?
---
so it's forbidden now to dislike stuff? he didn't even came here to rub it in your face. wtf is this bulshit?!
---
Isn't a decision like this up to Twitch, not Blizzard?
---
I kind of agree. I'm really excited for unbroken Loch Modan. It was a really chill zone that kind of lost its mojo post cata.
---
I remember flight paths being bad in vanilla. If they're the same on beta then they should stay that way. All the casuals always campaigning for changes to make things easier and less time consuming should stick to retail. You all already ruined that game so go play it and let us have ours.
---
It's entirely possible. I've had 2 Fireballs miss in a row on my first mob and then failed to kill it before going OOM because you wasted mana on the first 2.
---
It uses private server data and I can confirm their reputation, experience, and level values for some quests are off.
---
It has also republished many articles I was paid to write, without my permission, as well as the entire comments section, which is a pretty scumbag move. Every image thumbnail you see is also hot linked back to Wowhead's image server :(
---
Blacksmithing has 2 specializations, Weaponsmithing and Armorsmithing, you can only choose one. Weaponsmithing has 3 further choices for Axes, Swords, and Hammers, again, you can only choose one.
---
For a long time, the [Arcanite Reaper](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12784) from Axesmiths was a God Tier weapon used by every PVP warrior and paladin. It was considered THE reason to go Weaponsmith and there weren't many other reasons, if any. This was mostly due to the axe's very slow speed (3.8 seconds).
---
Instant attacks, such as Mortal Strike, are calculated as follows:
---
    damage = base_weapon_damage + (weapon_speed * attack_power / 14)
---
So the slower the speed, the more damage on those instant attacks.
---
This is also why the [Barman Shanker](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12791) was so good for rogues. It's 2.0 speed made huge Ambush and Backstab numbers.
---
In patch 1.8, all weapon speed for instant attacks was normalized:
---
* 1.7 for daggers
---
* 2.4 for all other one-handed weapons
---
* 3.3 for two-handed weapons
---
* 2.8 for ranged weapons
---
This meant, no matter the speed of your weapon, it would use these numbers in the damage calculation. It was a significant nerf to slower weapons and the Arcanite Reaper fell out of favor.
---
In comparison, Armorsmith's have access to a ton of different resist gear, some of which is Bind-on-Pickup. But more importantly, they'll have access to [Lionheart Helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12640) which is Best-in-Slot for Fury Warriors for the entirety of Vanilla WoW.
---
There isnt going to be open beta.
---
That's why, for launch, I just put the time in as "vacation" and left it at that.
---
Tying to tag wolves for an hour just for 1 quest, wasting a day of your life to leave the starting zone. 
---
"best gaming experience"

You guys seriously you need to stop.

Yup - always did

You mean play the Peggle mod!

---
Good riddance to these retards
---
Depends how much your Guild lists you over other warriors.
---
Too soon dude
---
I mean we really are nitpicking things that dont matter now.
---
My only question is how do Streamers such as Sacriel get in to the closed beta... He told me he did not sub to BFA or legion.  I have no problem with streamers getting beta keys but are they getting useful info...
---
 He is so far removed from playing that he would have no idea whether something is a bug or not.  Also so much for needing BFA sub to be invited.  I don't even want a Beta Invite...I just want things to actually be tested and bugs reported.
---
Fair, didn't actually see that post somehow. I'll delete this one as I don't wish to clog up the subreddit more than it already is :)
---
Well that's disappointing. Gotta love how there are the 3 typical douches in here saying "NO ONE CARES, GET OVER IT". I'm starting to wonder if Blizzard employees don't come here to blow off steam.
---
Don't promise your customers a recreation of vanilla, only to half-ass it and not deliver.
---
I remember when I saw a red dragon while taking a fp at lvl 60 I remembered came back and killed that dragon
---
1. Shard management is prio. Ill get this to work tomorrow i hope ( [https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/issues](https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/issues) )
---
2. Nightfall proc Should work, but i have no chance to test it since im level 17 @ beta :P Using /necrosis recall should give you the opportunity to move all the buttons?
---
3. You can rebind the big ass button to do something else instead of life tap in the optioms
---
4. One can hope &lt;3
---
Yes, but traveling to work is time off wow. Probably just going to quit
---
That's real raiding :)
---
I assume this is the same in Classic as it was in Wotlk, but the actual cast times for creating things for example with blacksmithing, were awful. Idc if it takes 5 seconds to make one thing, but 15-20 seconds for one thing? Bit much.
---
Feel free to pull request onto the git repo and add bugs if you find any \^\_\^
---
I take back what I said, because I found supporting documentation. The picture you linked is from the WotLK beta.
---
Evidence 1: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757517876
---
Evidence 2 (with the actual mode artist of this particular screenshot openly admitting that it was created toward the end of TBC): https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/605170-Sylvanas-Blood-Elf-Skin/page3
---
Sylvanas remained as a Nelf until the PTR of WotLK, and her model was slightly augmented to the "official" second version in 3.0.2.
---
Activation Blizzard have a longtime partnership with Twitch, ex: StarCraft and now Overwatch (https://www.twitch.tv/p/overwatchleague/en/) - They have a really powerful influence.
---
Reported for rule 34
---
What exactly is wrong with enjoying solo play? You sound like a child who is upset that someone is enjoying playing with a toy when they should want to play with your toy.
---
You won't be able to get rank 3 before phase 2 though.
---
Yeah you're right, could just be very unlucky.
---
So it's not going to be classic wow at all. Huh.
---
Seriously disappointing. Wtf are they doing? How does something like flightpaths affect people exploiting? Blizzard makes little to no sense. "We don't like you exploiting and making the game too easy, so we built the exploit right in for you".
---
I really hope they don't go with just one realm... I need to avoid streamer realms at all costs, this would essentially force me to play in the same pvp realm
---
I agree. It was late last night, and I was bored with argument. I just pulled up supporting documentation showing that his picture is of a prototype model submitted for consideration in the WotLK beta. Sylvanas did, in fact, remain as a Nelf throughout Vanilla and TBC.
---
No, wasn't suggesting that.
---
But by not giving TBC and potentially wrath legacy servers, you end up splitting the community with private servers as well. 
---
I really like Classic wow but TBC is the version of the game that I love. So if it was ever announced that TBC servers would never come out, I would go to private servers to play TBC. I'd just rather get a server done by Blizzard so it would be higher quality than what I'd get from a private server.  And I know I'm not the only one that feels this way as well.
---
Idk, based on some of his reactions I've seen he kinda seems like a manchild.
---
This just show how WoW is not an RPG anymore
---
Those were ON POINT 😂😂😂 lmao!!! If Classic fails him he can do impression comedy
---
What a fucking retard, OP DM me his name
---
Can I join the circlejerk too?
---
Vanilla is the perfect game, everything else is for losers.
---
Honestly even on beta the mob density is... Alarmingly low I feel.
---
Can run around on a Westfall farm patch for 30min when you need 2 more mobs cause there is 2 other guys there with you.
---
Yeah you can group up and will most likely be required to when it goes live but I dont think it should be that low?
---
 Agreed  , its a feature so no idea when we pick it up ;) [https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/issues/3](https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/issues/3)
---
very good points, thanks for the reply.
---
I mean look at it this way. I don't think they'd be inviting some random if they didn't invite those streamers. They're doing it for advertising and trying to get people hyped into trying it that wouldn't otherwise.
---
Get attunements, pre-bis, epic mount, professions.
---
I dislike you and think you’re a retard. You should not retaliate.
---
I assume this is already in the beta megathread if not it needs to go there ASAP.
---
I also didn't hear it making any sounds but they could have been quiet or turned off.
---
If you can find any quests do them, you will need tho gold. But when that's said you will probably run out of quests to do before you hit 60
---
Truth hurts.
---
Eh there were always tons of 70s in IF and SW on my realm and in STV people were always fighting over AGM including 70s trying to get it for twinks. As someone who spent a long time leveling in TBC there was no shortage of high level players to slaughter you.
---
Why not just grind out the Deathcharger's Reins???
---
Alright....This is where I *DRAW THE LINE*. I want my old birds back dammit! Taking flights was so cozy. I remember back in BC I would hop on a flight path, open a game of Bejeweled, chill.
---
But if the launch is smooth, we wont have an authentic vanilla experience.  NO CHANGES!!  /s
---
Indeed i wasn't really bothered till i watched it aswell
---
Grind some rep, farm your mount, get bis, world pvp, grind honor
---
Frostadamus was on point
---
Experience launch day. It'll be better than the beta. As one who has experienced 3 launch days with 10k other people in private servers, it is unforgettable.
---
So if I follow correctly the perks from weaponsmithing were nerfed which makes armorsmithing more attractive. Thanks!
---
Whatever you want that’s the beauty of the game.
---
Personally I’m going to be playing both retail and classic, in classic I’m going to level to 60, get BIS gear and WPVP and in retail I’ll just raid log and push some keys. 
---
But for you it could be leveling alts, making gold, maxing professions/rep, become a world PvP menace in one area etc.
---
STREAMERS REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Don't think there's any important factions you could farm off the bat unless you're a hardcore player going for MC clear asap. But that can wait for more important stuff though.          
---
I think it's a matter of just running dungeons and getting proffs up, farming gold for any crafted pieces you need.      
---
Quests wouldn't be that important unless you're trying to get a specific piece that can be used for a prebis alternative or that's decent til something drops
---

Can't wait for the blue post where they say they looked at it and it's correct, without providing evidence of course.

I just went to test it, funnily enough had the perfect thing happen to me to prove his point. Lots of resist against L2 it seems. Killing a L1 doesn't have anywhere near as much, so here's a vid: [https://youtu.be/nBWi\_-UZ\_C4](https://youtu.be/nBWi_-UZ_C4)
---
Worth noting this is obviously not a classic video, so it could be inaccurate but from what I've seen it's been fine prior to this.

who cares about SnD ?  evis is crap unless its 5 CP.  just do green or yellow Q's and it wont matter.
---
Exactly, you're capped to lvl 30 and can only test the low level content. But there's still a huge 30-60 content that needs to be tested and for this you need more players
---
in theory I like the "no flying mounts" idea but in practice its tough. Outland was clearly designed with flying in mind with lots of unreachable by land locals and of course blades edge mountains. Even if there was a good work around such as additional FPs to reach the otherwise unreachable by ground areas, would they do it?
---
The only impact this change has is that you can now stay in a BG queue while you hop off the flight, rather than having to decide whether it's worth dropping it to land early. Pretty minor overall.
---
Horde players might not find this video fun since they get salty over anything that makes them look bad.
---
On a PVP server everybody needs STAM though.
---
I don't know about about Cata, but the simple fact that Hillsbrad was one of the best zones in classic gives me a lot of doubts that it improved in Cata. Remember the Lich Quest? One of the best of the game.
---
Though having a level 30 cap for like a month does look pretty fun :D
---
Yeah. I mean in endgame, it's not a big difference because the imp just runs itself oom twice as fast. Burst damage is higher, but over a long fight total DPS from the imp doesn't change a lot, since it's mostly mana limited.
---
While leveling, where fights end before the Imp runs OOM, it can be pretty nice.  I am playing this build at 30 (current level cap in beta):
---

---
Not only does this allow the imp to do a lot of damage, it's also enough damage that the Imp actually holds agro pretty well.  Of course his HP runs out pretty quickly, but by controlling agro with strategic use of searing pain I can let the Imp tank for a few seconds and then pull away before it dies.
---
This can be slightly alleviated if you are horde.

Hex of Weakness - reduce healing received by 20%. **Lasts two minutes. No cooldown, no limit on targets.  **

Rank 1 is 35 mana. It is a curse, so only mages and druid healers can remove it.

Troll master race.
---
If they only cared about being in the starting zone, they'd prevent people from being able to leave them though. I doubt it did that much harm, if any
---
That frost impression is just spot on wtf haha
---
Alternatively, my one friend asked if I would level a new character with him on retail since we are not in the beta test. I pulled 6 starter mobs at the same time with no threat of danger and just spammed my 1 key with no regard to my health or resource management. 
---
I will say that at times I miss the new combat animations but Classic is so much more engaging during the leveling process it's not even funny.
---
I hope they remove this. Watching them do wsg and just turning on nameplates and being able to see where the flag carrier is from anywhere in the enemy base was pretty lame.
---
Man I miss that addon
---
1. Figure out how you're going to make money.
---
2. Get your epic mount.
---
After that, it just depends on what you want to do, but I think most would say:
---
3. Get your keys. BRD, UBRS, Onyxia, etc.
---
4. Get your gear from BRD, Scholo, Strat, and eventually UBRS.
---
5. Enchant that gear.
---
people want tbc and wrath servers for sure, there are pservers of them being played rn
---
I clearly remember lighting being shit in wow classic and having to create-&gt; delete to see the actual color. Are we sure it's not intended?
---
In essence they are two games, i just think twitch hasnt yet made the call to split them as its just beta access atm.
---
Well well. You will be able to run 5mans when u want,Zg, Aq20 easily. In the guild however, The main tank will be someone from leadership. The main tank is extremely time consuming though. You can join as one of the offtanks and build your way up as time goes,because people naturally come and go.

RemindMe! 96 days "di this"

Ron Jeremy Jr. can stream where he wants.
---
Advertising is good and all, I just don't know how someone who doesn't know/remember the intricacies of the game can give any good feedback.  Esfand knows alot about the game and his class, and probably has given more useful feedback to the devs in a single day then most have given the entire beta.   need more of his kind, not streamers looking for clout.
---
I remember taking the Auberdine - Theramore flightpath for the first time and flying over zones that I hadn't seen before, it was pretty cool.
---
It's even in the half of fame for videogames alongside tetris, Super Mario, Zelda and doom and a few others.

Selling a beta code isn’t bad enough to make someone a “piece of shit”.

Jesus Christ this streamer witch hunt is just getting old at this point.

Flying mounts were a mistake
---
I'd like to see BC/wath class balance/design with more vanilla content, if they were to release more content after naxx. BC and wrath classes are 10x more fun to play, it would be a shame to be stuck on vanilla class design.
---
Is there a clip yet of someone on the beta using this addon to nail down the timing? If so, please share!
---
Trying to do quests at the starting zones during the stress test was very difficult and time consuming.
---
What?
---
I hope it can distinguish between Retail, Classic and Private Servers, otherwise data might be messed up. :/
---
When you're in the Beta by the grace of the developers and they tell you not to sell the beta keys, yes, it does make you a piece of shit.
---
Professions in final fantasy are quite good :0

He read the headline and commented. Why read more words when few do good?

I hope this community doesn't go the way of the retail one, classic tbc and classic wotlk shouldn't have significant changes if they come out.

It got only 5 charges though

I for one will not give two shits if any of my friends are on different layers than me.

&gt; casuals always campaigning for changes to make things easier
---
How on earth is giving a flight an RPG element (that it had) is making is easier??
---
Noone is asking to have them run faster or skip points or whatever ...
---
But they're not expecting good feedback from them. That's what I'm trying to get at. They aren't replacing people that might know stuff (many probably don't) from the pool of non streamers. At least I highly doubt it since it'd be kinda counter intuitive.       
---
It'd also be hard to get more people that actually know what's supposed to work, and how it's supposed to work considering. Not like they just have a list of peoples memories.
---
I keep hearing that but I could never get into them. I see the appeal, but it doesn't fit what I want. But a lot of FF14 doesn't appeal to what I want even though I'll certainly admit the game does a lot good.

Deep frost isn't bad for pvp.

Reminds me of the ending of one of the episodes of "Allimania". (A legendary German World of Warcraft audiobook).

that's a good QoL change

At that time everyone will what ne about how we need a tbc server.

Yeah I noticed this too.  Incredibly stale and inorganic feeling.  It literally feels like one of those rides you see outside of the supermarket.  At least with the gryphons you don't have to put coins in th-

Don't really care personally. Just something that will probably get fixed down the line but I would like more pressing issues fixed before this.

And wash your hands afterwards.
---
&gt; my goal is to gear  
---
Since nobody felt the need to read your post, I'll respond to the part you wanted people to respond to.  
---
Gear isn't really obtained via reputation in vanilla like it was in later expansions, so you don't need to worry about that.  
---
You should absolutely be spamming dungeons. Make a list today of all the gear you want and write down where each item drops. Attack the easiest dungeon first until you get the item (unless it's a super rare item). Then do the next hardest, etc. But also join any dungeon that you need who is LFM and would be a quick join.  
---
You should also consider how much gear you need to buy during this period. You should be saving as much gold as you can from the dungeon runs, which wont be a whole lot.  
---
If you get to a point where gear from the AH is going to be a much larger upgrade than whatever is left from dungeons, you might take a moment to farm some gold.  
---
There is a question of when you should buy your epic mount. I always say "as soon as possible", but really you just need to toss it in there at some point. You should look at your epic mount as another piece of BIS gear and prioritize it roughly equal with everything else.
---
Oh no, someone doesn't share the same opinion as me, pitchforks.

ofc i should! i'm a retard, remember?

and there i go:

---
Assuming you're in a hardcore guild, you're really not going to spend as much time in raids as you think.
---
MC can be cleared in under 30 minutes. Onyxia in 20.
---
That's an hour a week until BWL drops, which can be cleared in 45 minutes.
---
Depends on your class (gold farming ability) and how hard you actually wana go. The more consumables you want the more of an investment it's going to take.
---
For example if you are a hunter you can farm gold incredibly fast. You probably can get by on just mongoose and mana potions as well as dark runes. Maybe basic bitch enchants.
---
If you wana go hard and be super prepared for everything:
---
https://imgur.com/a/u9LDFVH
---
You're gona have to farm more. If you want to respec every week for PvP, you're gona have to farm more.
---
More raids come out. You are trying to get pieces from multipule raid lockouts so now you are looking at additional raid nights as well. More consumes for those. 
---
Let's say you want to do the **absolute bare minimum**. You do the current raid tier, basic consumes, basic enchants, no additional raid nights, no PvP respecing, no epic mount. Farm mara for ~3-4 hours a week. Current raid tier for 3 hours, 2 nights a week. Total investment comes out to **~10 hours a week roughly.**
---
Let's say you are putting in **maximum investment**. Current raid tier, additional raids for off pieces, full consumes, BIS enchants, PvP respecs twice a week, epic mount, DM runs and songflowers before every raid. Farm mara probably in the range of 8-10 hours a week. A couple hours a week farming Felwood consumes manually. 3 hours, 2 nights a week on main raid. Hopefully your guild does alt run or speed run of old content, 2-4 hours a week in old raids. If you are respecing for PvP you are probably putting in... minimum of 5-10 hours a week there. If you are making a ranking push this number will go up a LOT. Final total doesn't include any of the random shit your guild and friends will rope you into every time you log in. Total investment comes out to **~25-30 hours a week roughly.**

Good point, I'm not sure if the sound is the same but it is there in the beta clips, esfand has game sound turned off on this one I think though. On smooth's clip the sound is low but you can hear the flap flap

What a mediocre opinion held by a mediocre player that has a mediocre achievement score.
---
Actually good. Wtf.
---
Lol this is the most classic vid ever....especially numa numa
---
The whole leveling experience is soloable, you just have to be careful, not distracted and plan correctly.
---
&gt;1748 Guilds killed Mythic Argus according to WoW Progress, so 4000 guilds and the 20% you mentioned is imaginary. 
---
Oh, good, so we're both dealing in imaginary statistics, then, since given our data here, you aren't part of any 1%, and you claiming your guild did "similar pulls to Method" while doing 300 more can't even be described with words like exaggeration or hyperbole.
---
You take pride in calling yourself the 1% for having an achievement that 3.8% of the population has compared to 100% of the entire armory being parsed for achievements.
---
Not even between level 110s, not % of people who have AotC or have ever done level 110 content. Every single player pulled from the armory.
---
Sorry, that's comedy. You coming in here with your thinly veiled humblebragging about having an exclusive opinion when you were in an even shittier guild than I was at the time.
---
Let's review the bullshit you spewed for validity:
---
&gt;I consider myself apart of the 1%
---
Or, the 3.8%, apparently?
---
&gt;Took me and my guild 600 pulls to down Mythic Argus in Legion 
---
I believe you.
---
&gt;and similar pulls done by guilds like Method
---
600 =/= 320. Gotcha.
---
&gt; The only difference between guilds like mine and Method is schedule.
---
Oh, right, I forgot your guild is comprised of some of the best players at their class in the world, makes addons for the community WHILE PROGRESSING THE CONTENT, writes WeakAuras and creates guides after the fact.
---
You are delusional. If the only difference between your guild and Method was to do with hours spent raiding over a period of time then your claim that both guilds took a similar amount of pulls wouldn't be total bullshit.
---
&gt; It took a lot of coordination. It was not easy.
---
Didn't say it was easy for any guild. I'm saying you're way too far up your own ass.
---
Okay what the actual fuck buddy. What the super fuck. Did you read? Watch the clip? Do you even know what we're talking about right now? holy cow
---
Immersion ruined, i am unsubbing
---
That's actually an RPG element. It's details like this that makes the difference between a great RPG and a mediocre one.
---
Goodbye my friend!
---
Who cares? #notyourgame
---
Don’t know about streamers but there’s a guide out there, just google “speed run classic wow” should be the first link, I’m on mobile so I can’t link you rn. It’s very detailed and has a map
---
The fuck is wrong with you
---
You mean the lunch breaks?
---
Early access is different, it's not a beta. It's the developers saying "Hey, guys, so...Here's this unfinished game, we're releasing it now and we totally promise you that we will keep working on it and it will be fully ready in x months!", and then they never finish it.
---
"Early access" is just a fancy word for releasing an unfinished game. Classic hasn't been released yet, it's in beta. Meaning, it's not publically available. "Early access" games are publically available, ergo they have been released already. That's where the difference is.
---
I enjoy seeing the sights. But I've seen them hundreds of times before, and I don't need to see them constantly in the future
---
What professions  do you think Will be most profitable if you put a lot of hours into it?
---
Want the truth... cause I'll drop it... Just not sure you can handle it.  Okay.. you convinced me. Bottom line is Classic is giving WoW aka Blizzard the most viewership its had in a long while even surpassing BfA beta, BfA launch and even their eSports efforts across every IP. Viewership turns into money at some point down the line no matter how you want to break it down.
---
This actually makes me happy, I don't want that kind of player in WoW Classic.
---
Everyone who writes that Warlocks are PvP gods has never played classic......
---
1. there is no 1v1 in world PvP ppl will mob you and kill u easy as a warlock you CAN NOT run away. On top of that once you are dead you are screwed.....no pet...no soulshards etc.
---
2. In BGs warlocks are outclassed by many classes and if u play soullink your dmg will suck until AQ Gear. (i dont even mention purge cleanse etc pp)
---
3. As soon as a hunter has you in target you are DONE -if its a beastmaster- stop whatever you are doing and use the time he needs to kill you to take a bathroom break cause there is NOTHING you can do....marksman/survival not much better they maxrange you 24/7.
---
4. Do not be fooled by PvP videos most of them a extremely misleading ,better gear then opponent, clever editing etc pp
---
Fair point...and I understand its a matter of just playing the game to find bugs.    However where the beta has turned into a farming lvl 30 BiS consisting of running the same dungeon over and over and over....does not provide the most useful data.  Players exist that would be willing to put aside fun to actually test things.  /rant over .. Just want the best for Classic.
---
Yeah that's not really what I am looking for. I do know of said guide and of course Joana's old videos are also up. I am specifically interested in streams because people may actually answer some questions or give some comments they may not give in a "normal" video.
---
one macro gives you top dps 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Nah, that’s a gross overreaction. Btw he’s in there because of hard work and him being a public figure for WoW.
---
Joana and Seren, I know for sure both of them will be 60 in 7 days max.
---
Not as much now than it was before.  Private servers were inaccurate, but it turns out they were over tuned, not under tuned.  As it was, MC and BWL were getting steam rolled there.
---
You have 1.12 + reduced (compared to private servers) mob armor with Classic, MC will be just another dungeon run with more people. 
---
This whole quitting your life, raiding 4-5 days a week was really only a progression thing if you were somewhat raiding on par with the current patch in old Vanilla.  You'll have more than enough time.   Classic will be running 1.12.
---
Naxx however, will be pretty much on par for what it was.  That will require some amount of dedication to farming consumables, buffs, etc.
---
The WR holder streams here 
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/joana](https://www.twitch.tv/joana)
---
but the world record is also almost 5 days /played
---
Full time streamers also play games for a living, mening they'll be able to put much more hours into "testing" than the avarage Joe, while creating hype at the same time
---
I'm trying to think what other MMOs might compete for GOAT, and I'm coming up a bit shy.
---
Maybe Guild Wars 2. EVE is amazing but it's too niche imo to compete for GOAT.
---
I wasn’t young and I certainly wasn’t inexperienced.
---
They should've made flying mounts glide isntead of literally flying, so you can jump off a cliff or something to shortcut a bit.
---
you can't
---
I don't know, something about using the lag and spell batching to push out more than one mind flay per cast. Now that I think about it maybe it won't work on Classic. I know my cousins did it a lot during vanilla. He and his brother would single out a healer and blow him up in a few seconds.
---
I never understand these questions. Take a look around and you see pretty much every bank alt is wearing a tuxedo. Do people actually consider it a possibility that it's just them?
---
Hunter was the best in vanilla imo. The Rhok'delar questline was THE best class quest in my opinion (few classes even get a quest at high levels) and it makes you feel SO ACCOMPLISHED when you complete it.
---
I’ll beat you to 60 that’s for sure

Joana himself is streaming aswell. He might stream himself leveling and I guess that will go pritty fast.
---
It's ridiculous how many people get upset about others 'hating on classic, just let us enjoy our game!" but then they go right back around and shit on retail and people that still enjoy it.
---
Also can try Kargoz. He is into speed leveling warlock and has a vid of stream on YouTube of early beta.
---
I wish people felt this way today.   A lot of the people who complained about BFA are the ones who blew through the leveled from 110-120 in like 2 days and say there is nothing to do.   Those folks were also the beta testers who got bored.   (The same will happen with Classic.   They’ll play the shit out of it for 3 months for stream views then complain) 
---
I have 9 level 120’s and some 118’s and 114’s on Horde.   I’m leveling them with questing, Islands, Pet Battles (currently went from 25 to level 80 on a Highmountain Tauren only on pet battles)
---
Lots to do in this game.   Thanks Blizz.
---
Interesting. I'll have to look into that, since SPriest is my planned main for Classic.
---
Absolutely unplayable.  I guess Classic has failed before it even launched.     
---
&gt;You should have dots up on every mob pulled in a dungeon or raid
---
This is wrong : there's a 16 debuff slot limit in Vanilla and warlock dots are generally not chosen.
---
You sir seem like a weath of knowledge.  Care to contribute to the community?

Alright then.

Did you live all these years thinking that was real?

I assume they exist in a config file. The 1.12.1 client stores your settings in the WTF folder, I don't know where on the modern client it will be stored but it has to be in there somewhere.
---
Vanilla/Classic WoW is very noob friendly.  It was originally made to be an alternative to the MMO’s at the time which required a lot of time to do anything and were very unforgiving to newer players.  While Classic WoW is a huge time sink, it’s not that hard to get the mechanics down and slowly ramps up the difficulty as you progress.  You will the hardcore players say “It’s so easy”, but just keep in mind that it was designed to be relatively simple initially.  
---
Vanilla WoW was my introduction to MMO’s, my first character was a night elf warrior by the name of Maddface.  I went through to level 40 before I even knew how to use any of my abilities how they were supposed to be used.  Hell, I did not even know what a tank was until someone in my guild asked me to run a dungeon with them and pointed out that I should have a sword and shield to help the healer out.  I was like, why is that I do more damage with my two hander and he pointed out that my job was to hold the mobs on me while everyone else killed them.  I was upset at the time because I thought I was supposed to just kill mobs.  Eventually folks in my guild taught me about threat, abilities used to increase threat and I became one of the off-tanks for my guild and even then I was still noobish to it.  I clearly remember doing MC and still learning about tanking mechanics (how taunts worked in raids, interrupt rotations, etc.)
---
Sorry to go off on a tangent there (just super excited for the game if you can’t tell), but to reiterate Classic WoW is very noob friendly.  While others in this thread are telling you to try the free version first, I would not recommend that just because of the low level cap (I believe it is lvl 10 but I could be wrong).   You really need to get at least to about lvl 40 before the game truly becomes interesting as then your mechanics start becoming important.
---
Honestly just expecting launch day to be full of crashes and broken servers. It wouldn’t be Classic without it but thats ok I guess.
---
as a dwarf i couldn't run into the Dun Morough center fireplace at the trainer building. surrounded by invisible wall
---
&gt;There is a question of when you should buy your epic mount. I always say "as soon as possible", but really you just need to toss it in there at some point. 
---
like me getting a driver's license
---
jokes aside, thanks for the response, you really seemed to be the only one having read the body of my post so I appreciate that
---
i dont =(
---
i wonder if  setting up in BFA is the same since its downported
---
Don’t forget the dot though. On average 3 will have it down to next to nothing and 1 staff will do it
---
I 100% agree with Mark here. Vanilla is my favorite time in WoW because the design wasn't hyper-focused on endgame despite having an amazing endgame. TBC just made the rest of the world feel like an obstacle to get to outland.
---
Also, i think 40-man raids is much better for the game. The fact that they were able to design raids around having at least 3 or 4 of each class is amazing, and it can be made much better than vanilla without a debuff limit.
---
Imagine having stuff like a demon summon that requires 4 or 5 warlocks to summon and then control? Or more talents like improved scorch and shadow weaving. Raid dungeons where you have a stealth group.
---
They could even keep shamans and paladins as faction specific classes. They could make faction identity even stronger by doing things like bringing back undead actually being undead and immune to fear (with the downside of getting wrecked by paladins). Windfury could end up stacking with poisons, and possibly flametongue.
---
I want a wow thats moves forward and not on rails.
---
its a new allied race alt
---
Our CSS guys did their best to try and emulate it here. I think they did a pretty stellar job.
---
They are fairly easy to play. Their dps is not great but they have lots of utility.
---
You'll be back
---
I mean, World of Warcraft (vanilla) was the game that created the single player MMO market.
---
Doesn't bother me at all.  Classic beta has been a blast. Not ruined by flying animations.
---
ty!
---
Did it give zone discover xp? :)
---
On private servers, dagger rogue was pretty good for leveling because you could 'frontstabbing' mobs, this won't be the case in classic though
---
God speed my friend, I love shadowpriests!
---
real and possible scenario made you sad?  
---
why is that?
---
just play IN Germany
---
I don’t see anyone mentioning using weapon swap macros for a dagger spec...you open with ambush and then switch to sword/mace for hemo attacks and you can switch back to dagger after a gouge or kidney shot for a backstab. It’s actually very efficient at one on one mob killing once you get the right talents rolling. I would stay combat until at least you get hemo and then talent switch.
---
Screenshot the moment! Then RP walk back to your trainer and spend half your gold on new spells. Then probably respec and grind dungeons.
---
This is really the only thing that irks me with WoW Classic. I remember watching my gryphon banking around trees, it felt more natural and immersive.
---
But those people always end up crazy.
---
Okay but change my view:  
---
when you speed level through all the 'building' your character stuff, you end up with little attachment to it.   
---
if they want to do that, they could just give people a lvl 60 char to give to a friend who wants to get into the game. Same thing and doesn't crush the early game into dust for everyone else leveling with friends.
---
Any chance that this is about how the camera follows rather than the flight paths themselves? That's what it looks like to me.
---
Welcome to the club sir, I have the exact same symptom as you.  
---
My sub for bfa is just rollin and I have not logged in once since I heard about the beta and the release date.  
---
be strong my friend its only 93 more days left until we are released back in Azeroth again.

---
Foolish to grade classics gameplay in the first hour alone. Most great experiences are built up over the journey
---
Are you sure he didn't have those flight points? It might just be a visual thing,  on private servers the bird connects at each flight master on your path briefly, but in vanilla the flight was smooth, you'd fly near your connecting flight paths but you wouldn't touch down at the flight master.
---
Alexensual.
---
Classic isnt out yet.
---
Definitely is, wish people were more reasonable and we could get a few more like that. It is possible to separate gameplay changes from UI cleanup.
---
How does he have these then? [http://puu.sh/Dx68T/c65f89e9aa.jpg](http://puu.sh/Dx68T/c65f89e9aa.jpg)
---
Do you have beta clips of the same flight paths as the original clips?  I'm thinking the IF approach (and UC is this way too) flight path is a poor comparison since it's always been notably mechanical because your taxi needs to thread narrow openings instead of wide winding rivers.

I hope there is an open beta as well at some point.
---
Farewell, mortal
---
You gotta make your troll account less obvious, mate.
---
I mean, I know vanilla wow probably pulled a lot of inspiration from DnD.
---
So
---
A wolf has 11hp and a level one wizard can learn a few cantrips, firebolt being one of them, which has a casting time of one action and hits for 1d10 fire damage. At your lowest, that's 3 dmg and highest 30dmg with an average of 10 damage.
---
So, from an rpg perspective, you'd want to cast like 3-4 firebolts, and then be like "ya, I'll save my energy for the NEXT wolf and just hit this one in the forehead a few times with my staff, why waste the mana".
---
It's not about being mediocre and rushing through wolves. It's about the journey and utilizing your current setup to best deal with both the environment and your enemies alike.
---
See ya in classic
---
I would set remonder to july and resubrscribe then, shorter hype wait
---
Thats a bug, you could LoS with that window etc so shouldn't be possible to charge through either.
---
I feel like 90% of the people here are pretending they knew all along
---
Wrong since evocation is based on mana regen in vanilla
---
considering blizzard's stated goal is to have somebody quit in 2004, come back and feel like nothing has changed, this is a bug that needs to be reported. yeah, some things will obviously stick out, like laying and battlenet, but there's no real reason why they can't program a flight path properly.
---
People who call others entitled are the biggest cucks on the planet.
---
Closer to BRM as well. So UBRS, LBRS, BRD, MC. All the goodies.
---
Source on that? Is that your own opinion?
---
This is what wiki calls Early Access: 
---
&gt; Early access, also known as early funding, alpha-access, or paid-alpha, is a funding model in the video game industry by which consumers can purchase and play a game in the various pre-release development cycles, such as pre-alpha, alpha, and/or beta, while the developer is able to use those funds to continue further development on the game.
---
I played Disc through Naxx in Vanilla, so I have already managed to secure a token SPriest slot in a pre-Classic guild  because of my prior raid experience. I will finally accomplish my decade-long dream of being a Vanilla SPriest 😂
---
Axesmiths still have Nightfall which is even more important than Arcanite Reaper.
---
Ironforge is the best ~~Alliance~~ city.
---
&gt; Very few people like this set up and they prefer feeling rewarded and invested instead of just being handed things for logging on.
---
You aren't "just handed things for logging in."  That's not where the lack of reward comes from.
---
The lack of reward comes from everything being so bloody RNG based, with no way to work around it (like the old JP/VP vendors).  It means you're taking wild stabs in the dark as to whether a daily - oh, wait, "world" - quest will give you an actual better reward or not.  Heck, every reward is a random loot box, basically.  Might be better, might be worse, might be the same thing you're wearing.  Instances are different in that you know there's a finite range of things you could get, but it's still subject to RNG.
---
I've been grinding all kinds of daily/world quests both to gear up and to get up rep with each faction, and yet my ilvl isn't high enough to jump into raids (at least with the "Mythic" raiders that my friends raid with), because I keep getting downgrades, or the same piece I already had, or some nonsense like that.  The biggest slap in the face was when the ilvl for emissary rewards went up and I was about to get a nice reward that was set to be +15 ilvls above what I'd been getting... and then it turns out to be an item I already had that had Titanforged, meaning it was the exact same ilvl and everything (hell, same vendor price!).  Thanks to bloody Titanforging, this new item that should have been an exciting upgrade just got sold (or maybe scrapped for crafting mats for alts, can't remember).  I have slots that are lagging behind at times because I can't target a replacement for them.  I have to wait for a quest to pop up, then I have to pray that its random reward is an upgrade.
---
As for instances, I've only been able to do LFR so far, because people running M+ dungeons and raids won't even glance at anyone below 400 ilvl, and LFR was like grinding my face against a brick wall for hours and getting only one actual upgrade the entire time.  I mean, yeah, my luck is legendarily bad (kind of a running joke in my tabletop gaming group), but FFS, I'd like to feel like my time wasn't a complete waste.  And that's what it feels like more of the time.  A complete bloody waste of time.
---
And more items. More itemization for underserved specs. A tier 1.5 follow up to the tier 0.5 questline? 
---
I would love to see minor class fixes too, like pet scaling and redoubt proccing at defense cap.
---
There is so much they could do for a classic+.
---
Sorry you can't enjoy anything else, my condolences.

Practicing my path for my tauren druid, at level 1, I had enough mana for one wrath and had to melee it down after that.

I actually kinda liked that.
---
You start out as such a scrub mage that you run out of mana and have to hit it with a stick.
---
Then 4 levels later, you can one-shot that wolf, and you have a fancy wand so that you don't need to use the stick of shame anymore.
---
It really takes 6-10 levels to get class abilities and basic gear so that you feel like a proper &lt;class&gt;, but you had to earn your way there.
---
I remember it being that way, but after a certain amount of minutes had passed the flag carriers would begin to show on map iirc
---
I 3manned first boss on a pserver with 2 mages 1 hunter. Hard as hell.
---
That looks great! Any Infos from the Retail-people if Blizzard is allowing the use of Reshade/ENB/SweetFX for WoW?
---
I have no idea what are you talking about. I watched those videos and don't see any difference.
---
I mean you can...have fun, in instances it wont matter, but solo grinding is gunna be miserable, why not level swords? I've always been a dagger fan, but even I respeced daggers at cap after leveling with swords.
---
because games are being dumbed down in all genres because of people not liking difficulty. look at the sekiro shadows die twice game where journalists spammed articles that the game needed an easy mode and anyone who disagreed is entitled.
---
A part of me gets, depressed, that people don't want a challenge or a deep experience anymore.
---
The only option is to try one of those good old secret servers but I fear burnout
---
Classic WoWs mechanics are clunky and old, it's a 15 year old game after all.  If you enjoy going back and playing old RPGs(like Mass Effect 1 and Dragon Age: Origins) because the experience is still fun, even if its outdated, then I think you'll be able to enjoy classic.  It is a big time investment and things will take a lot of effort.  Most people are going to take over 200 hours of play time just to reach max level.  But things feel very rewarding because of the time and effort it takes.
---
As far as it looks now the beta is working like vanilla so calm down. People are just not remembering that certain long flights indeed did not have any connecting flight paths.
---
Gank then till theybquit

Gank lowbies year up and in general be cancer

because blizzard likes SW more and enforced it as the hub.

---
&gt; You can't win all the time and enjoy winning.
---
This isn't true. It's just a cope we've developed to protect ourselves from losing.
---
Classic does not need QoL changes. Double specialization is even better QoL change.
---
but not true, so very small instead
---
World’s aren’t always the same, different servers existed at launch.
---
This reminds me of making a post on social media and then getting upset that people are replying to your post.
---
I'd say 20. If you're not feeling it by 20, chances are the class isn't for you.
---
Closer to Menethil, Closer to Blackrock Mountain, which has relevent content for a **LONG** time, BRD, UBRS, LBRS, MC, and BWL. Straight shot from the bank to the AH. Better ambiance. Ironforge is the best city in the game hands down.
---
Already exists, but the guy who made it is a nobody so nobody gives a shit and it didn't get much traction.

---
When did they make them worse? Like how does it get less detailed as expansions go on ?!
---
Hahaha
---
Lol fukken recked
---
This is what the beta is for. I'm sure it will be fixed. If they just built classic from scratch we'd be looking at a 2021 or further release.

In the original classic, the API was less restricted and a lot of automation could be done (especially through Lua scripting). However, as WoW Classic is based on the modern client, the API will be a lot more restricted. You can still adjust some graphics variables, such as glow effects, ground clutter clipping, view distance, but this is basically the extent of my knowledge. I'm confident a programmer with more experience with addons (only made a simple one) can weigh in.
---
i thought something looked off! good catch!

im building a pc using old cases and stuff from the 90s-2004 haha ( all new parts inside )
---
high society top hat club is where the real money is at.
---
I mean, that's fucked up but also pretty damn funny
---
Knowing what role you enjoy playing helps in determining what class you will enjoy the most.
---
i cant beleive this is an issue
---
Pretty sure it was fixed before 1.12. Can also confirm it's definitely fixed on classic.
---
Well, this is something i dont agree with you on.
---
Blacksmithing is just as useless as in BfA. Leatherworking is useful at the very start of a server with the devilsaur gear and hide of the wild - after that its useless.
---
Tailoring is a bit better than BS and LW. But still not nearly as good as it was in TBC.
---
Alch/Ench/Engi/Mining/Skinning are good in BfA and good in Vanilla.
---
Cooking/Fishing/First Aid are good in BfA and good in Vanilla.
---
20 is the magic number. 30 isn't bad either but it will take you considerably more time which will be wasted if you reroll.
---
What
---
I think it's key to realise that Classic's gameplay is, let's be honest, pretty terrible in some areas, especially for MMOs these days. Rotations for a lot of classes in PvE are a couple of buttons. But it's more about the world and the experience and character building more than it is about flashy gameplay.
---
diamond tipped cane
---
If you read the comments in the thread, you’ll find that the FP’s seem to be working as they were in Vanilla. Darkshore - Theramore was 1 flightpath with no midpoints. Orgrimmar - Gadgetzan was also 1 flightpath.
---
Unfortunately most of the people on the beta are not there to test things.
---
You should compare paths 1:1 to have valid proof here. 
---
Also it seems that in beta videos the camera is locked, while in the older videos the players are rotating in constantly which definitely adds to the “more alive” feeling.

Let's talk about the dozens of threads about this
---
Could always try another game, to scratch the oldschool mmo itch I play osrs, but that's just me.
---
They are great if not best pvp healers with an Armor feral healer build. If you get good at flag running you have a name on your server immediately and get in the right crowds for better content. They are the only healer with remove curse, combat res, and are generally more mana efficient once geared (even with zg gear and trinkets). Natures swiftness oh shit heal macros with a healing power trinket saves raids. They are the easiest to gear up in a raid, as you will always need them for MotW which is the best non-blessing buff in the game, brez and innervate when you first start up raiding and gearing. I personally was in a forever DKP minus hole cause drops only I can use dropped, but it never mattered and I could just ignore that whole min maxing dkp scene. You never have to pass on an upgrade cause there MAY be a bigger one next.
---
This is what I would say druids are best at. They are not a master of none class, but defo a jack of all trades.
---
Same here, I just resubbed yesterday with the hope of getting into the next beta wave. I haven't played retail for yonks so If I don't get into beta they getting sub money from me for nothing untill the game comes out
---
That stuff changes the gameplay, this change only makes it so something that *could already be done* by logging out is easier and less immersion breaking.
---
Before Classic was announced most of the people here would admit they have no clue what they were talking about..
---
But suddenly everyones a Vanilla Veteran / Expert
---
Since people are mentioning all the ways BFA could be searched, I did one of these for "wow bfa", "wow battle for azeroth," and "battle for azeroth."
---
- [United States searches](https://imgur.com/9IjH0gN)
---
- [Worldwide searches](https://imgur.com/GjnP0Z2)
---
Bonus: Added "world of warcraft" to chart, but only did [U.S. searches](https://imgur.com/E8J29MK) because the chart pretty much looked the same when switched to worldwide.
---
They didn't make an easy mode, did they? That game is my last resort purchase to hold me over until release. It would be very uncharacteristic of From Software to cave to such complaints...
---
Scrub want a decked out toon handed over to them, no want level and time invest
---
In the best scenario, Nightfall equates to about a 4% spell damage increase. It's usually not worth the DPS lost to achieve this.
---
LFR is not a good QoL change. Ruins the community of the game. Dual spec I personally like. I know it’ll never get added to Vanilla or even if they did TBC, but it would be nice to maybe pay a big one time expense to learn it, and then maybe a small 2 gold fee to change specs each time.
---
I wanna play Warrior and tank in raids, but also PvP in off time. Sadly I don’t have the time though to farm 100 gold every few days just to keep respeccing back and forth.
---
Also their respec costs are insanely high and stupid.
---
Nice! Yeah it's hard to fit more than one in a raid unfortunately. On a recent private server the entire lock team banded together and helped the spriest with his consumables. Something like one major mana potion or elixir of shadow power per warlock per raid. A fair trade for boosting our damage wouldn't you say?
---
can the mods do something about this subreddit just becoming a fucking advertising ground for twitch clips?
---
So if the game has dynamic spawns, why on earth we need layering then?
---
HUNTER’S MARK shows a pulsing aura on the character after applies but this pulse should only show once, when the hunter first applies the mark. In Vanilla wow hunter’s mark only showed the arrow pointing down from the top of the target’s head not a pulsing red aura that remains constant after the debuff is applied.
---
Opinions are like assholes. I'm proud of my achievements regardless if you want to downplay them or call me things i'm clearly not. I already made my point about Method. They are a world first guild. I used Method as an example because it's a highly known guild even to the likes of non-raiders.
---
Your 3.8% comment didn't take into account that it took 1700+ guilds killing M Argus to reach this percentage. At the ~500 kills mark, it was very much around 1%. That was also well before the nerf that occurred in mid-June, which caused that percentage to jump significantly.
---
Your need to discredit me is very entertaining though. I hope that works out for you.
---
Ok bye
---
What are "today's standards" then? If someone were to make an RPG (not an action-RPG) today, what would they do different?
---
This wasnt in vanilla.  You could hide in bushes on arathi basin and other places and ambush people capping flag.
---
Which is why offtanks that won't do much damage anyway use it.
---
You generally have more than one offtank.

A lot of things can be a challenge when you're new, we've learned over the years that certain mechanics are bad and we've practiced them.
---
Classic wasnt hard you just needed to invest a lot more time into it, some see that as hard.

Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning.

Crafting professions are mostly gold sinks and rarely become profitable.

Jesus christ that video has a shit load of ads, might as well have the whole trackbar yellow
---
Most of the animations in the beta have a similar problem
---
Then why are 20+ people stating otherwise in this thread?
---
Nothing personal but have to agree. Old WoW didn't just "give you" any flightpaths. You had to walk there first or take a boat/tram/zeppelin.

"today's standard" means scientifically generated fun by increasing mounts gained pr hour.
---
You don't need protection specced off-tanks. Hell, you don't even need a protection specced main tank.
---
Just because you"re low level doesnt mean the gameplay should be boring. Vanilla is riddled with questionable game design.
---
Can't remember off the top of my head fully, but I think gnomish has more toy type items that only they can use, and goblin is better bomb type items however gnomish can use the bombs if they buy them. I believe I'm probably missing some items though
---
&gt;Can we talk about Layering?
---
Yeah; Its shit its a bad approach and dynamic respawn is better.
---
There you go
---
Let's hope so. The fact that they're running classic WoW off BFA is already a huge red flag, but I'm holding out hope they can make it as Vanilla was.
---
This hopefully will be fixed
---
Pretty sure all theorycrafting has already been done for classic, nothing new to find there
---
Its really the best case scenario that those kind of folks have an alternative to play and won't be mucking up our fun. Sure we'll still have the occasional shit bag to deal with, but not nearly as many.
---
Having leveled many alliance characters I can say I know basically nothing about this zone. So I can believe your comment.
---
By 20 I think you'll have an idea. But I'd personally give it up to 30 if your on border at 20
---
Jesus man. I think he's just pointing out that the interest in classic is at least as popular as bfa ever was. I think this is more showing all the nay sayers that yes people do indeed want to experience classic again.
---
During 1.12, if you weren't in Naxx you were waiting for TBC.  People stopped raiding.  Did anyone bother doing dungeons?  My point being, people's experiences with 1.12 and what it was will be small.
---
Like so many posts on this subject before;
---
Would you rather have multiple dead servers with very low pop after the initial rush with tourists and BfA players just checking the fence only to be gone after 9 days? Layering will be alright, and once people start reaching 60, or X amount of time passes (heard phase 1) it will be gone. And everyone is in the same server.

Blizzard fixed the *lighting* on a lamp post to show how much detail they want back.

This is a way bigger deal than that.
---
Yes, we did it a lot actually. Atleast on private Servers.
---
We were BWL geared and it was a simple task with voice com.

The beta footage has the gryphon constantly fluttering it's wings and never "gliding", where as in vanilla it did a lot of "gliding". It really does look like it's on a rail.

Outland was a totally separate world that separated all players above 60(for the most part) from the rest of the game. Even the main city of Shattrath let players avoid the faction capitols, for the most part.

Having a guy on standby in tanking gear with nightfall ready to switch to shield is not that uncommon in my experience and sometimes people who want to tank goes for a tanking spec even if they aren't MT.
---
"The pack" will only be playing a few hours a day. You can sleep.
---
I despise Retail.  I despise 1.12.
---
That being said, the difficulty of Classic is exaggerated.  It was never a hard game.  Raids even in their original form were never "hard".    It was however time consuming.  I guess hard is a loaded word.  I should use "straight forward" instead.
---
Classic will be steamrolled even more so than they were on the apparently over tuned private servers.
---
It should be separate. End of story.
---
Not as much questionable game design as retail, that's for god damned sure.
---
"riddled" - nope, its a great game. They tried to "fix" all those issues over time and we end up with a pile of flaming dog shit. (everything post WOTLK and WOTLK was kinda shitty too).
---
I'm so glad people like this are willing to stress test our servers and then never play the game.
---
I believe hundreds is more accurate Sir :)
---
No it doesn’t
---
That's a general discussion on WoW forums for ya. Since Classic has it's own section now, general discussion is filled with BfA fanboys, shills and Classic haters. It's their new safe space now, because Classic fans are in their own section, so the last few dozens BfA fanboys can bitch about that nostalgia bullshit they keep parroting all they want and almost no one argues with them, because it's just a waste of time.
---
When I check their profiles in the 90% they're LFR heroes. Good, those people can stay with BfA, Blizzard is making retail especially for them. No one wants them in Classic anyway.

Loose lips sink ships.

This guy gets it. Most likely reason is that Blizz doesn’t want them to split. Expansions no longer have their own sections.

I know that with the Hue Sync program for PC there is a 'video game' mode. it basically takes the Image you have on screen and tries to replicate the color palette based on where your lights are placed. 
---
for example, if the right side of your screen is green and the left side is red, the right and left bulbs will be green and red respectively.
---
not sure how to do it with health bars, but i can imagine a hacky solution where you have an extra window that turns red when you drop in health and green otherwise. you would then set the Hue Sync to sync with only that window, instead of the full screen. 
---
going to be trying this myself once i get access to WoW classic :)

I think you swapped your numbers there lol

He prefers 1 shotting everything and things costing an inconsequential amount of mana to the point where mana has no purpose. Who wants a challenge when you can afk through all the content and not feel rewarded a single time? Damn retail sounds fun.

This is what I have been saying too,  if they do TBC then do it without the flying mounts.  Put down an extra flight path here and there for places you could only reach with flying mounts but don't add the ability to fly.  
---
I want to see what TBC without flying could be like.
---
Every dungeon has trash too, so can get some at beginning of raid as well
---
Why does everybody on the classic subreddit try to justify boring gameplay with being challengin? Challenging gameplay can be fun if designed well.... This example is not fun nor challenging.

years ago i played a hunter and had a pet boar called FrankNBeans (named after the tins of beans and sausages in dayZ) and he was a great pet who tanked many dungeon runs for me and my 2 mates

Any forum post on this?
---
Lag macros still exist in retail. You can and will be banned for abusing them too hard in especially rated pvp.
---
I meant at the entrance waiting for everyone to get there and get ready

---
Personally, I love the male Orc hunter shoot animations, they’ve always looked amazing to me, especially with guns but bow looks nice too.
---
Hard to make a fair comparison if we aren’t getting identical flight paths. 
---
The lack of banking and additional movement from Esfand’s flight could simply be due to where he’s flying into IF from and not a lack of animation. 
---
That being said, I agree that *if* it is from a lack of animation it should absolutely be addressed.

If it's like clearcasting+blizzard then it's proc per channel

Possibly, I will only tolerate their shitty posts since there is nothing better to do until for next 3 months!

Yeah, BIS at 30 is literal fresh content. Raiding for quest rewards in Badlands, dungeons you normally skip becoming the new UBRS.

I would love an open 'beta' where we're locked at 30, then 50 for a month each prior to launch.

Please explain me how spamming the same attack 4 times in a row is challenging? He is not talking about challenging, but about engaging/fun gameplay. If anything classic wow is way less challenging than current high end raids. Litterly spend half the time afk on boss fights cause you will overagro otherwise... Yeah, real hard.

Old videos or screenshots would be better, although harder to find. Joana has been going back to his own old videos to crosscheck before he reports bugs for example.
---
You're right. Poor choice of words and wrong on my part. Being on a dead server sucked. I should have said people cared,but if desperate paid a fee to transfer characters over or started a new character on a populated server. They should add the option to switch servers without a fee. It's not the players fault a server is dead.
---
Well it makes sense they're not now because Classic isn't even released yet.
---
But I damn hope they will be separated after the release.
---
Its guys like you that cleared Naxx and got rank 14, we are in awe
---
I'm perfectly calm. Retail sucks though. I just tried it again. I and million of others want Classic Vanilla WoW back, not a half-assed job slapped on top of current retail.
---
I'm not sure why a repeated sentiment here is "They CAN'T JUST ROLL BACK THE SERVERS! Do you have any idea how hard that would be!?"
---
Why? I've already seen like 4-5 things on this sub that point to 1) Them blatantly not paying attention to a few big things.

Nice catch, this definitely needs a fix. Upvoted

He has ruined a perfectly good illusion that I did t even know existed
---
If a guild is raiding classic 20 hours a week in 2019 somethings wrong.
---
Rejoice even
---
Maybe they could add a drop down menu to filter out bfa/classic streamers. 
---
But separating them is unlikely to happen, better to have all the views in one place, rather than split between two.
---
It's not a fallacy.  The decision to make changes comes before the decision as to what changes are made.  If you decide not to make changes, then there will be no changes.  If you decide to make changes, then there will be a thousand decisions as to make on which changes will be made, what is the basis for changes, etc.  Those decisions in their nature are open-ended, subject to human error, and the "slippery slope" concept is a fundamental human failing that any human can fall into if they aren't careful.  So for you to say there no slippery slope, when it's humans making the decisions, is fundamentally denying human nature and burying your head in the sand.

I read that you can train Gnomish engineering, make all the cool BoP toys and stuff, drop engineering entirely, pick it back up and re-level it, then go Goblin engineering for their stuff. Not sure if that’s how it’ll work in Classic but I read this on the subreddit about a month ago.
---
You completely misrepresented yourself several times in order to set a validitated ground for the opinions you were stating in that original post. I'm sorry you're upset that at least one person knew you were talking out of your ass on here.
---
&gt;Your 3.8% comment didn't take into account that it took 1700+ guilds killing M Argus to reach this percentage. At the ~500 kills mark, it was very much around 1%.
---
Oh, good, now we're barking up this tree. Shall we examine some other conveniently isolated statistics? What percentage of raids that killed Mythic Argus had 2 elemental shamans on the first Argus kill? Or a holy paladin named Tbh? By god, baretbh, these statistics are starting to point towards an even more exclusive look for you: you are the 0.001%! Holy fucking shit!!
---
Just gonna leave this amazing quote here:
---
&gt;The only difference between guilds like mine and Method is schedule.
---
Most classes are terrible until level 10, and dont fill out into subclasses until level 40. Part of why the barrens chat is so flithy is because the toons are too easy to play
---
The average classic fanboy replies here are amusing. Everybody instantly jumping on the "challenge" boat. Pssst guys, being at a low level doesnt mean the gameplay has to be boring as fuck. And please dont try to convince me how spamming a firebolt 4 times is hard and challenging.
---
I think that sounds about right for progression. 
---
If they are doing less they must not be wanting to get the fights down as much.
---
Or are you thinking that it’ll be as easy as private servers?
---
Depends on the class.
---
Hunter 15-20ish
---
Warlock 15-20 ish
---
Warrior: 25-30 and tank some instances
---
Priest: 25-30 and heal a few instances if you want to be a healer, 41 for shadow
---
Mage: 20-25ish
---
Shaman: 20-25 and heal and DPS some instances 
---
Druid: 20-25 - highly suggest both healing and tanking some instances 
---
Paladin: 20-25 heal some instances 
---
Rogue: between 30-60 with some PvP and instance DPS experience 
---
The reality is that leveling is almost irrelevant to life at level 60 if you’re a class that can heal or tank. I’m assuming you want to do more than just quest/grind for the duration of Classic of course.
---
Level 10 cap on Wednesday the 29th should be interesting, especially if WSG is still enabled.
---
What if you are feeling multiple classes at that level?
---
I’m clearly talking about the leveling experience, not the end game. Classic has a better leveling experience and retail has a better endgame experience. I’m not arguing that.
---
Right in the feels :(
---
I agree, personally 1k needles is where I first got that sense of " wow, I am in a huge world " . Running through the valley was quite the experience the first time around, then you clip the edge of Feralas, and you see the giant trees...my heart light up.
---
No one looked that dapper back then. At least the hot unicorn has a concurrent theme.
---
I feel you.
---
You know there will be lvl 1 players talking crap in Trade about how Classic sucks.. because they have nothing better to do in BFA.
---
It was the boss in BWL that dumps agro infront of the door after suppression room.
---
So the vaaaast, vaaaaaaaast, *vast* majority of you guys just want early access right?
---
I mean it's all obsolete in August *and* you have to pay for this priviledge of testing their game.
---
I just don't get it I guess.
---
RPGs back when character creation spawned a noob rather than a Demigod.
---
Entitled? What?
---
Aren't we beta testing the game to make sure inconsistencies like this don't make it into the final version? Beta testers are entitled for... doing their job and pointing out bugs?
---
Don't we WANT Classic WoW to be as close of an authentic experience as possible? Isn't that what this community is about?  Are we supposed to be satisfied with whatever lazy incarnation of almost-but-not-quite Classic that Blizzard conjures up? 
---
I think we should press Blizzard to make this as close a replica as possible, just like we had to press them for YEARS to actually even consider re-releasing the game.
---
Because revenue $$
---
Ignore is a godsend, hehe.
---
cant speak for other editions, but the newest for d&amp;d has them. a level 0 spell, so to speak, that you cast indefinitely.
---
There are a lot of downsides to having dual spec, it takes away from character identity as a high respec cost promotes sticking to that identity. If youre building up your character to be a bulky tank warrior, maybe its intended that you won't be able to swap willy nilly to being a nimble swordmaster
---
No shit?  I thought I witnessed it a couple of times near the release of BFA.  Did an arena and the monk was porting around like crazy.  Also did a WSG and I stunned the flag carrier as he was going up their tunnel and he just kept sliding up the tunnel.  Looked exactly like when someone would use a lag macro in vanilla but I hadn't witnessed it since then.
---
Shaman might be one of the hardest classes to play just due to time investment. Even though there is obviously a lot of cross-over in gear, Shaman may need three separate gear load-outs given one spec values magic damage and mana pool, one spec values raw hurty stats, and the last spec values +heal and mana regen. All that being said, every spec on shaman is great. Resto in particular is absolutely crucial to raid success and there have been plenty of times when I've innervated a shaman and said "please save our fucking raid you glorious bastard".
---
As a druid, i've always envied a Shaman's ability to actually fight. Druid's are a utility class that needs to be generally good at everything (which it is). In comparison, Shaman can choose to be fantastic at one thing and still very good at another (by virtue of spec and gear loadout).
---
But those fucking totems man, lord save me on those totems. get an add-on for those.
---
  Cause it has been like fucking 2 weeks.
---
yeah, guys! stop it! he should go play on the bfa server where he can tag all the wolves he wants because there's only three other people in the starting zone and none of them will ever interact with him!
---
I love when people try to say "end of story" cause it allows me to comment on their post, and drag that story on (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
It's possible they will separate them (didn't that happen with OSRS?) but it's likely Blizzard would ask them not to. Having them together puts them higher on twitch which is something they want.
---
The inferiority complex on this sub is amazing tbh.
---
It wasn't obvious that that was my opinion? Really?
---
Still, the fact remains that a game in "early access" is commercially available to the public, everyone can play it. How exactly do you want to argue that a game that anyone can buy and play is not released yet?
---
The exact definition made up by the ones who invented the term "early access" doesn't mean shit. If you can buy and play a game, it has been released. Period. If you can play a game but not buy it, it's most likely a beta, but not yet released to the public.
---
There's more than enough examples of "early access" games being an eternally unfinished pile of crap.
---
Well, back to topic. You said yourself that a lot of games get released through early access nowadays. You mentioned games like PUBG, DayZ. They were released as early access, they received their own category on twitch. Because they were already released. They weren't in beta, they were released to the public. Classic WoW is in beta. It's not been released to the public. That's why it doesn't have it's own category on twitch. Because it hasn't been released yet. Once it's released, an argument can be made to put it in it's own category on twitch, but not right now, since it is in closed beta, not even public beta.
---
"Early access" is, as you said yourself, a way of releasing a game. Once a game is released, it officially 'exists' as a playable game open to the public. Classic doesn't 'exist' yet, so it doesn't get it's own category on twitch. Maybe it will once it's released, maybe it won't. That remains to be seen and depends on Blizz and twitch. But as long as it doesn't even 'exist', it definitely won't get it's own category.
---
I remember it being that way, but after a certain amount of minutes had passed the flag carriers would begin to show on map to the opposing team. Tried to look up this info but couldn't find it.
---
But I distinctly remember this because I mained a druid in vanilla and spent most of my time playing WSG. Some of the games were just plain hide and seek until they introduced the timer.
---
Many of us could think of ways to spend a lot more hours than 30. There's lots of classes and things to explore! Plus, the caps will eventually rise as the beta progresses.
---
no, most of us don't want to play open beta august 27th.
---
Same 😞
---
That run is a rite of passage. Stop trying to take the easy way out lol.
---
In comparison to Vanilla the crowd's *extremely* slim. In most cases BC/Wrath servers don't finish their patch cycles because the population fizzles out before the server can end
---
dont worry, not many people will play with you guys :)
---
The right picture fits both more accurately. The suave looking suit guy is a rare sight in Classic.
---
Classic is warriors showing up to raids in S&amp;M gear because all the good BiS pre raids is leather.
---
It's paladins wearing dresses with leather shoulders, using a shining sword in one hand and carrying *flowers* in the other because it's better for healing than Judgement, which aside from looking amazing, is actually terrible.
---
Almost everyone looks goofy as hell until naxx. Some even after that.
---
Yep, mounts per hour is how you measure fun in retail WoW.
---
This was the first time my friend had submitted on the F&amp;F list (Recent hire at Blizzard within the past year or so) but he said he put me on as his only person for priority.
---
He doesn’t even have nameplates turned on..
---
By 20 you should know if you'll enjoy leveling to 60, but for at least 4 classes, you won't know if you enjoy end-game until you're in the end-game.
---
Same here I HAVE to see the Barrens restored to it's awesome magnificence and Thousand Needles as well!
---
It will be nice to see the Stonewrought Dam eventually as well and that NE area and town and well everything Cata destroyed!
---
I hated what Blizz did to Azeroth in Cata so damned much! It was like vandalizing a great work of art!
---
Meh got BIS gear pretty much except for a BOE. My character has the best enchants etc max professions within reason. 
---
Not much else to do
---
I depart from some of the other Druids in the community by really stressing Druid's role as a healer. Yes feral is good and there are some people who have clearly pushed it to a level not seen in vanilla, but the average druid should focus on healing with minor PVP talents and should put in the time in raids to get the pvp gear it needs to have fun in off times. That was my experience and the experience of the best Druid's I know. Obviously im going to get a different experience this time around, but given how much fun i had and how fondly I look at my experience, its hard to recommend anything else.
---
Yeah blizzard will shed a tear. Ow wait, all the money is still going to the same bank account with none of the effort required. They will be in real pain.
---
Let me iiiiiiiiiiiin!
---
at 30-40, you have the basics for all classes and speccs.
---
It’s simple, chose if you’re gonna play pvp or pve. Then say that you all join the first/last in alphabetical order.
---
Alliance? *spit*
---
Paladin? *vomit on the ground in pure, unadulterated resentment and disgust*
---
A 1d10 damage spell at level 1, able to be cast multiple times? Sounds like some new-fangled 5e D&amp;D stuff :)
---
I hope this is allowed, a gif not from the beta, so delete if it breaks any rules
---
[Here](https://gfycat.com/givingmeanemu) you see an identical path to esfand once he's flying inside ironforge. My camera was locked in one position too. It's clear to see what OP is talking about, which is the tilt of the gryphon. In esfands example it is horribly static.
---
I'm sure lots of Blizzard employees view this subreddit. I hope the demand from the player base for more beta invites is heard. 
---
To me, it seems beneficial to invite more players to the Beta as they can test and evaluate layering not only in the stress tests, but in the overall "normal" Beta server to see how it is developing.
---
It better be as a horde character...
---
I think doing it with 5 people will be a very real possibility imo.
---
Staysafetv has a couple vods where he speed levels a warlock
---
No I didn’t.
---
So you're saying you all just want the experience to be as great as possible for the people who couldn't get in when release hits?
---
Pardon me but...
---
Yeah fuckin' right.
---
Report the bug to blizzard
---
I understand what you're saying. But there are many more classes and testing to be done. It's not just about gearing your single toon out! You're invite is intended for more than just hitting the cap and getting BiS :)
---
Well that's obviously taken right before Garrosh bombed Theramore in Cataclysm so it's completely irrelevant!
---
you could make a youtube video - WORLD FIRST ARENA TRINKET BEST PVP'ER EVER LEVEL 5 UNSTOPPABLE FT. *insert random streamer who happened to be in the camera shot for one second*
---
It should, unless Blizzard decides to randomly add requirements to the gnomish items which would be kinda weird
---
The hate that this sub has for wrath is crazy. Outside of this sub, most people consider wrath the best expansion, here it’s “one of the worst.”
---
Dungeon finder came in the last couple of months of wrath. Catch up heroics similarly came in the last few months (although with a weaker one added before.) 
---
Wrath was not perfect, but it was great.
---
It was changed to a short 20 day 'grind' sometime after wrath or cata. The old grind was MUCH longer.
---
This is not exactly correct. Before 1.9, there was only one ah on each faction, and for alliance that one was in IF. I don’t know why patch notes says linked because that is not what happened.
---
You should test it
---
You’re being humble. You KNOW this is good.
---
I'm not crying , you're crying 😭
---
It certainly should be reported, but I'd like to see a comparison of identical flight paths - perhaps (and just follow me here) - perhaps the tilting and turning and griffon effects are part of the individual flight path and not something more global.  I'll go on later today and see if I can emulate that 2007 griffon ride video.
---
Regardless, make sure this gets into the megathread, and everyone start reporting it in-game.
---
Oh my god, you mean to tell me that our character is basically a scrub that just picked up his first spell/weapon and he has difficulty killing a wolf right away instead of one-hitting them like on Retail? DAMN.
---
You can totally make heirlooms in Vanilla IIRC. I vividly remember having a hand-me-down white sword with Fiery enchant on it!
---
Got me to level 10 awfully fast.
---
I can see that for sure. But does anybody ever wonder why nobody players tanks and healers? Because the costs to keep going back and forth are insane. And trying to do any solo content, whether it’s in random zones or farming, can be hard to do with the lack of DPS in the specs.
---
That’s why nobody plays these classes. I’d love to play a Priest or Warrior to heal or tank in groups, then go DPS on my off time in PvP or farming or whatever I want to do on my own. Problem is, costs are so high, I cant do it regularly.
---
I made this [site](https://classictinker.com/flight-master/) to find the optimal routes when travelling around with flight paths, boats, zeppelins etc. It's not perfect but might help cut down on that travel time :)
---
They don't have servers with enough power
---
I enjoy watching Esfand, I think he's an alright guy but hearing him call Sonii a "pathetic loser"  was clearly uncalled for (fyi, it was indirectly but still, we all knew who he was talking about).  I never saw Esfand behave like this until he became a big shot on Twitch. Ppl change. 
---
If they think the sniping is bad now, wait until people start creating PK guilds that target streamers once people hit 60.  It's a part of their job (yes, streaming is a job), if people don't like it, they're free to quit or roll on a PVE realm , you can also stream with something called a stream delay.   
---
You're making a lot of money while playing a game that you love, don't ever forget how blessed you are to be in that position.
---
Not in classic though
---
Will you take balance too?
---
Added two more links for the last people who doubted... It's not camera, it's not angle, it's not the flight path. The gryphons we now know do not tilt when turning. They follow a rail and stay real straight. Old flight paths actually looked like big ass birds flying up and down and taking tight turns. Rest my case.
---
If I ever get super rich I'm buying Blizzard just to delete retail. Then I'll make montage videos for Youtube of me laughing hysterically at people's forum posts that retail is gone forever.
---
its not  
---
even addons have to have special version to work
---
I'm not a twat.
---
And in retail as a rogue with some heirloom I 2-shot everything up till 13, after that 3-shot everything. How is that fun :(.
---
The game is improved in many aspects, but lvling and RPG-elements are trash :/
---
To each his own I guess, One shotting everything in retail seems less challenging.
---
what exactly is difficult about spamming fireball?
---
Well said Sir, let them keep instant gratification and frontloaded content. I will claim back epic moments of vanilla, having few of the people that have been there with me will make it all the better
---
I remember that it had a max of 50 or something back in the day.  Had to clear it out every other week to make room for new spergs.
---
More like every 30mins or less.
---
I did a comparison just a second ago, check it out, I added links. Tell me what you think. You worded it well, so I'm all for double-checking, but some people just doubt like crazy and don't even word it gently...
---
Thanks for sharing! Convinced me to snag a copy on Amazon.
---
Then why did Tribe (warrior) beat Perplexity like 3 times in a row easily? Twice with all cds up. Both good players. But when Perplexity duels tipsout its a joke. Riddle me that genius.
---
Dem onion cutting stealth rogues are everywhere. 😭
---
Added comparison
---
I wonder if this is the record for the longest sentence ever.
---
Wow, edgy. The point of the beta testing is for improving the servers so that when August 27th comes around the experience is as smooth and bug-free as possible for **everyone.** That's what Blizzard would hope everyone who is invited is interested in doing. 
---
Don't take your feelings and project them on to others. Doesn't help!
---
Says the cool guy subscribed to r/classicwow
---
Sure, but there's still interest and it would be similar to the retail community to pose ourselves as an obstacle to those xpacs; plenty of people do prefer TBC over Vanilla and WOTLK over anything for their own reasons and they do quite a few things differently and better (imo)
---
Unless this is a quick fix, would be a huge waste of resources to devote development to something like this
---
I thought BFA removed First Aid?
---
It doesnt matter what they said if what we experience is different.
---
You see you can talk about population control all you like but the stress test servers prove that layering didnt help at all, maybe it made it slightly easier but still... it was almost impossible to finish quests in the starting zone because of the amount of players there. And layering WAS active.
---
Im not talking about the stress test period when they summoned bosses but rather the period when people were doing w/e.
---
And they arent making larger population caps (per server), what they are doing is making it possible at LAUNCH for larger number of people (tourists) to play on a single server without the queue-times being half a day.
---
As a result the individual server caps will be larger but only until layering is removed aka after tourists are gone. So its a temporary cap-increase.
---
Just imagine playing without layering: you create a character on a low pop server at launch, you play for a day and logoff... you login next day and end up in 3 hour queue because during the time you were playing alot of other people joined your server because its launch day. Obviously you had no idea this was  happening since you were already ingame.
---
Layering is clearly there to prevent that from happening. If layering only works to spread out the max pop of a server then what is the cap going to be per layer? clearly  it cant be as high as on the stress test if you want smooth gameplay for everyone without needing to spend 20 minutes to kill ONE mob for your kill quest.
---
Granted its still beta so things may change and maybe layering turns into proper traffic congestion. Ofcourse everyone probably hopes im wrong because otherwise we will have serious problems early on to level up because of the congestion.
---
For now layering seems to work the way i explained... if they change it and improve it then im happy to be wrong. :P
---
Ion did actually address this in an interview, they're  not planning on doing anything with it because all that drama was a part of classic, whether it was ninja looting, guild drama or even new stuff like streamsniping. 
---
We all saw what happened when Epic tried to ban snipers, that backfired hard on them, I don't think any other company is gonna try to do that again.
---
Do you mean if I'll accept balance druids into my guild?
---
I agree. I never raided and I loved it! It's the RPG part that blizz took out and destroyed from MMORPG

I still think some details could go a long way with this though. Imagine if spells got more menacing looking depending on the power calculated when it's released. That way it would make sense when some novice rinky dink mage can't kill the wolf with a little fart of fire. This would also show an immediate gratifying visual change when upgrading a spell.
---
If I knew you were gonna put that up I wouldn't have gone through youtube once again haha! Thanks, I added a comparison as well, for the same path, hope that clears up any doubt!
---
There are ways around it, im planning to play shaman and will go the ele/resto build. Strong dps and good healing (except probably for pushing progress)
---
I get your point though, but it would have to have some sort of drawbacks, i.e can only change in rested areas or just cities
---
Alliance cus of my friends.. i know ill have a harder time but i still think it will be fun :)
---
This is true even for Friends &amp; Family invites. You aren't guaranteed in even if you have a Blizz connection that added you to the list.
---
My hunch is that it'll be a couple weeks for closed beta invites (As maybe some big streamers like KingGothalion stop when they hit cap perhaps, or when Shroud gets bored and viewership dips and some people start not playing)
---
Considering there is a stress test next week, no way will a closed beta wave be coming before Thursday evening, but even that may be keeping hopes generous.
---
F&amp;F is your best chance, and even then that isn't a guarantee, as many of us were told Thursday we should have gotten in as F&amp;F but have not. 
---
My guess is it'll just be minimal F&amp;F invites the next couple of weeks
---
It's not about easy way it about keepup or try to be forward of the "pack"and don't loose too much time on the way utill start questing in goldshire
---
I main a mage in retail and I thinking about rolling warlock in classic but I dont want to be trash until aq/naxx. I dont mind the pve ramp up but I am curious how I will perform in pvp pre-aq? Will the rank 10 set be sufficient or will I still be lacking until I get t2.5/3 gear levels? I feel like I may be putting to much thought into the "they are shit until aq/naxx" rhetoric that seems to be present. 
---
Would mage be the better choice if I am looking to be competitive throughout the entire lifecycle of classic in pvp?
---
Yeah. I’ve been having a hard time trying to find one that will.
---
I personally did enjoy the 5-30 experience on a populated server, generally people are trying to be helpful - passing along useful gear. People giving free enchants in Goldshire. Plenty of people in /1 for any group quest. 
---
You are remembering the horrible parts but it would be ignorant to say its all bad.
---
They probably redid their models at some point, which involved redoing their animations, and now that they ported the old models back into the game the animation rigs still have some bugs in them. It's not the only animation bug to be found in Classic.
---
Tip: Remember to complain on the forums that the game is too hard so they make a Raid Finder and other terrible features so worthless no talent players can FINALLY clear dungeons they were too bad to complete when the game required skill.
---
&gt;I did a comparison just a second ago, check it out, I added links. Tell me what you think. You worded it well, so I'm all for double-checking, but some people just doubt like crazy and don't even word it gently...
---
If \*nothing\* else, there's a tilt effect in the 2006 video that does not appear to be there in the Esfand clip.  That 2007 video has a reproducible POV; I'm going to go check that out.
---
These streamers play a lot off stream too. Even after 10+ hours of streaming they still log back on to play. Source: I play the beta.
---
This....the countdown to classic counter on the website hurts to see it's still over 90 days too. Time to go check for the 3rd time this hour.
---
Thanks for that response.  I should definitely join some instances or dungeons and try grouping up; I'm not sure why I didn't think of that. =)
---
I have a handful of level 10-30's now and I like them all thus far.. trying to figure out which one I Want to main and wouldn't have though to try out a dungeon.  Always aiming for a support class but somehow every class I play is just as fun as the last haha.
---
Just remember to bring a class with a rez when you do dungeons since Druids are limited to a 30m cd battle rez.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Its an extremely common term for low level spells in RPG's
---
This is one of the most toxic subreddits I visit. Please take this to heart. Let's make an amazing community on launch.
---
Hey now we have a legit video from 2006 (yours) and mine still shows it's correct. Good post OP.
---
also refreshing this reddit every few minutes just in case :(
---
Is this a joke?
---
You see this as minor, but this is literally the ONLY way to fly and travel faster than my ground mount. The immersion is important on this one. When I started playing WoW, gryphons were one of the cool aspects that stuck with me. You got to fly on those mythical creatures that acted very realistically. The rollercoaster chairs we get for flight paths now are awful.
---
Cumbersnatch.
---
No matter which spirit healer you use, you will always be ressed at the GY closest to where you died. You can't cheat by running as a ghost, you'll just get TP'd back when you try to ress.
---
30 is when a lot of classes really start to solidify, but the road to 30 is kind of long. I'd say 20 is a good bet, and then just look ahead to see what abilities and skills lay ahead.
---
Hydra is trying out routes now as priest. [https://www.twitch.tv/hydramist](https://www.twitch.tv/hydramist)
---
No, pretty sure that was changed later in vanilla was it not?
---
It did
---
Funny thing is, you would have a more similar experience with changes. 
---
If the game was overtuned like pservers it would feel a lot more like your original experience.
---
He mixes up Blessing of Protection &amp; Divine Intervention.
---
Curious as to everyone’s experience. I personally played a lot during classic but very casually. I didn’t research gear choices, didn’t raid, etc, but I had a ton of hours played. It wasn’t until BC and Wrath when I started raiding and doing hardcore PVP. 
---
I’m thinking a lot of people were probably in my shoes, but I wanted to poll the masses.
---
The tilt is precisely what makes the bird believable... Aight
---
Exactly, as you progress through the starting zone you unlock some core abilities and feel yourself becoming more powerful. 
---
Getting those first greens, those talent poins every level. Grouping up to complete an elite quesnt and earning a big reward.
---
I really think that even if retail wow players feel the same way as the poster within the first 30 mins of gameplay, if they give it a chance then they will understand why leveling and character progression was so good compared to today.
---
This comic reminds me of my little brother. “Oh my god I unlocked XX in (this game you’ve never heard of)” “OK - leave me alone”
---
&gt; If we did not have it almost only the ppl playing from the very beginning would se any new content. The % of players that gets to do/see new newly introduced instances decrease every time you introduce a new one.
---
This.
---
You have attracted some downvoters, but the plain fact is that it would have made no business sense, or any other kind of sense, for the vanilla developers to make a post-Naxx raid that only the 0.1% of people (or less) who had farmed Naxx could attempt. Let alone giving that 0.1% Tier 4 gear which would have given those people an even more massive advantage over plebs when they could already delete anyone in blues.
---
You can't spend the bulk of your development time on content 0.1% of players will ever see, and which if anything makes the game worse for the 99.9%.
---
You can call it a squish or a reset or an expansion, but whatever it is, every now and again you need it if you want everyone to be able to keep progressing and see the new content.
---
I think that would be fair. Make it have rules like:
---
800 gold one time expense
---
2 gold per respec
---
Can only make changes in a major city
---
I am interested in Shaman as well because I’ve seen what destruction they can do as elemental. Problem for me is they just seem like burst kings and that’s it, no control or anything. And totem management looks like a bitch.
---
I also feel like gearing them up for ele would be much harder with all the other casters in raids and such.
---
When you die and your ghost winds up at a graveyard, that graveyard is where you will rez. It doesn't matter what spirit healer you talk to. You can run your ghost from the Dun Morogh graveyard all the way to STV if you want, but you'll spawn in Dun Morogh.
---
Once you get into the Dun Morogh map and die, you should be fine and not have to do the run around through Loch Modan.
---
I'm rolling Tauren for Endurance.
---
Racials for matter, however unless it's something like Fear Ward for Dwarven Priests it's not that big of a deal.
---
So just pick the race you like.
---
They do make a difference but they aren’t game breaking. Pick what you like. Playing your class well is what matters. Not your race.
---
My invite is for playing the game how I intend to. It’s hard for me to justify maxing out another alt that will get deleted.
---
That alt's a timebomb.
---
They have said that all the beta invites are pretty much finished.
---
-10, sit down
---
I'm playing the beta now at lowest graphics settings without a gpu at all. And I get over 200 fps
---
Some people will play this for the first time and will take these flight paths for the first 100 times feeling like they're sitting on a feathery subway seat, so...
---
"Big streamers like KingGothalion.." Kappa
---
TLDR at the bottom 
---
From personal experience and seeing what other people say when this is brought up I'd say around 20ish. 
---
By then you have several core abilities so you see how the class will play out more or less. 
---
With leveling taking as long as it does it's pretty important to really think about what role you most enjoy playing. 
---
When I first started playing Vanilla I kept jumping back and forth from alt to alt because I like everything (melee, ranged, support). 
---
But after weeks of playing I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere in the game because I didn't commit to a single character and leveled up. So I had to stop and really think about what I enjoy doing the most. 
---
I was torn between tanking (warrior) and healing (holy priest). I then thought about what was "easier" to play. As this was my 1st character and my RL friend was always saying how "hard" tanks have it I went with my priest. 
---
I eventually leveled my warrior to tank as well as several other 60s over the years, but I really wish in the beginning I had put more thought into what I, wanted to main as I "wasted" so much time early on with alts. 
---
TLDR: Leveling is a massive time commitment, think ahead about what role you see yourself doing and decide your class from there.
---
I hated the crap they did to STV and the Barrens...all of what they did in Cata to the world actually.
---
Leveling a mage in BFA felt exactly the same to be fair, with the difference that you actually grew weaker every time you leveled. At least you get stronger in classic when you level or acquire new gear.
---
&gt; Gear resets are really bad for keeping players interested in grinding WoW, and keeping people wanting to raid because you always know your gear is going to be made obsolete a few months from now when they release a new raid with objectively stronger gear.
---
That's how vanilla worked. Every few months a new raid came out with objectively stronger gear.
---
Just looked at mine yesterday:)
---
RemindMe! 93 days
---
I really enjoyed wrath! I never had a problem with dungeon finder but I can definitely see why some people don't like it. That being said, I welcome playing without it and remember what it was like trying to find a group before it was out, even though I was still fairly young back then. It's different for sure, in a good way.
---
I’m perfectly fine with that. I rather heal at first in PvE honestly, eventually I’ll attempt to OT. But I’m mainly PvP focused so that’s why I mentioned Heart of the Wild, eventually after I’m geared I plan on going 19/11/21. How hard is it to gear a Druid for PvP? I’m probably not going to be able to push past Rank 10. It time consuming.
---
Not saying it ruins it, it just added to the original flavour, and they're trying to replicate it, so just adding that point.
---
This definitely makes it easier.
---
To be clear, I wasn’t doubting it or you, ust hard to judge it accurately if we aren’t comparing apples to apples. 
---
To your point, without question, there is a definite lack of movement animation within the beta clip. So I’ll echo what a few others have said and you should be sure to add this to the megathread. This needs to be addressed.
---
Good catch. Add it to the list.
---
with my very first char at release I went with mY CE panda from Northshire Abby this way ultimately to arrive in the NELF starting arena to improve chances of getting NELF Mount. 
---
In the very end I went for the winterspring mount anyway. sigh.
---
Troll= the most aggro generation.
---
Tauren= more health.
---
Orc= Well the axe skill is good but Bloodfury on a tank ain't good idea, since it reduces healing received. 
---
I'd go with either troll or tauren if i was focusing tanking. For DpS and PvP however, Orc is king.
---
i 100% agree 
---
classes in wow are so different every patch , more than any other mmo
---
they seem to patch them to be more annoying too , i assume so there is more micro in arena
---
Some classes don't feel that great without gear though but you should get an idea of their play style pretty early on.
---
&gt;The point of the beta is for improving the servers so that when August 27th comes around the experience is as smooth and bug-free as possible for **everyone.**
---
Right. So that's already happening. Keep in mind the beta is one server. Release will have many. **Everyone** does not need to be in the beta to ensure release is smooth.
---
Throughout the games history it has always been the mid-tier guilds that spend the most amount of time on raiding. They have the motivation to keep going as long as necessary, but lack the ability to finish in a timely manner.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
The thing is, how do you reuse expansion content while keeping 100% to the classic pillars? Outland and Northrend for example arguably require flying mounts to function.
---
&gt; A 60 bis player should be just a little weaker than a 70 on quest /dungeon blues.
---
That is exactly what they were. Naxx loot was equivalent to BiS pre-raid 70 blues.
---
Being easy on a genre that was extremly hardcore  does not mean it was en easy game. It was only easy for the mmo genre
---
This is not small. This is actually quite huge.
---
I played WoW for a long time before I capped. Like I started playing mid-Vanilla and capped by the second tier of LK. 
---
When it comes to Vanilla i’ll always be a slow leveler.
---
Might be doable! If you get the chance to test it, please write a post about it! :)
---
Planning on doing that same route in the other direction, I really would like a travel that isn't so bothersome.
---
44 million total views on his Twitch, 3500 viewers at 8 AM PST while he's playing WoW Classic.. Is that not big?

---
I hit R13 the week before they got rid of the tiers.... From what I recall there was still only 1
---
People also want to get them on their own. I got one for my Paladin on *some unofficial servers* so I could swing it on bosses where my healing would not be needed. C'Thun weakened phase f.ex.
---
Even on a 10k pop server I could only find 3 different players able to craft them, and the crafting fee was criminal. 100g fee.
---
Did you specifically wait 3 days just to post this, when someone already had the theory on the initial hours of the stress test? LOL
---
People who cuck others cuck cuck.
---
I get where you're coming from, but if Blizz were to throw up so many different versions of the game they'd most likely fragment the already dwindling WoW community so much that all different versions of the game would see a truly lacking playerbase.
---
Also, once BC and Wrath have finished their patch cycles, what then? I don't think Blizz would be open to developing content for four different versions of WoW simultaneously (assuming we get retail/vanilla/bc/wrath). Developing new content for Classic is objectively much cheaper than retail due to the tools we have today to create game assets, so I see Blizzard being open to post-Naxx content, however actively developing four different versions of WoW would actively kill WoW's community imo.
---
Players don't always know what they want. That's how we got flying mounts, LFD/R, transmog, etc. I don't think we REALLY want 4 different versions of WoW, as much as people might think so.
---
I don’t know why people keep mentioning open beta. Blizzard hasn’t done a open beta since 2004.
---
Well, since you ask, one of my girlfriends in high school named Melissa really did not take my feelings into account.
---
This is a repost.
---
Lol his replies to comments after his article are the best
---
BGs will be crossrealm
---
This sub without a beta invite is like only being able to read a menu at a restaurant while starving.
---
Yeah, only thing I can think to do about that is turn  2D AoE like Consecrate and D&amp;D into 3D spherical AoE underwater.  Consecrate just surrounds the Paladin, and DnD surrounds the current target.  No other way to target DnD in 3D I can think of.  Monk’s Roll and Torpedo could be untargeted and just go in the direction the player camera is facing, since they always go the same distance.  But Heroic Leap is variable range, so would probably have to leap to current target, or max range in the camera direction if no target.
---
None of this fixed btw..
---
No, I think at that point it'll be the same dropdown, you'll just see the beta servers. At worst, you should be able to see it on your Battlenet account management page and they would be able to fix it for you
---
You could have chosen not to post this because it's been posted 100 times already.
---
&gt; people not liking difficulty
---
Being oom and having to melee as a caster after 4 spells is not challenging, it's terrible game design.    
---
We should be sad that some people actually enjoy that kind of tedious gameplay, not the other way around.
---
That's not true. Kevin Jordan ( Blizzard WoW Designer ) yesterday said there would be more beta invites for sure, but he's unsure when the waves will happen.
---
I like the idea of non-linked auction houses. Purely hypothetically, since it's not going to happen in classic.
---
They use this in other MMORPGs to encourage players to play the market, shop around, and take risk.
---
To make it work better they would need to consider making the tram a contested zone too, which again sounds fun to me.
---
Where was this said?
---
That makes sense given a cantrip Magic is a card that draws you another card with its effect, replacing itself.
---
I've been bothered by this for years, I really hope this is fixed.  It's such a small thing so I wonder if they'll do anything about it as it doesn't effect actual gameplay.
---
Make sure to report toxic people on here. Mods do absolutely bad people for it.
---
Michigang, idk about you but whenever I’m at work that’s when I think the most about classic. “What class will I play?” “What race” “what’s the first thing I want to do at 60?” All run through my head.
---
high five
---
You need to be Goblin to make Sapper Charges. But the Everlook teleporter and some of it's gadgets are arguably more useful.
---
it's likely not an animation issue. It's likely the code for how the flying works wasn't entirely finished to add the yaw to the flight pattern when flying, instead only doing the minimum rotation.
---
You’re not going to be able to use anything another Engineer makes. All the toys, trinkets, bombs, etc - it all requires engineering to use. The only useful items Engineers make that non-Engineers make are ranged weapons and scopes for those ranged weapons.
---
There are over a thousand people on beta. It is one of the higher skill floor realms I’ve ever been on. Not that everyone is good, but everyone does know how to play. As everyone there is a streamer, blizzard associate, or has played the ever living hell out of WoW for 15-10 years (it seems). 
---
I’ve leveled the classes I know well and reported bugs on them, I assume others are doing the same.
---
Yet, people find what appears to be bugs I’d never notice, for example the gnome height thing. 
---
At the end of the day, streamers are more useful than even me. IF I have beta, my eyes are on screen. My experience is translated into bug reports. If I am a streamer with 500, 1000, 50,000 people that is that many more sets of eyes watching and analysing my gameplay. Most of the blue posts since beta went up (at least those talking about bugs) have been in response to big forum posts made by people who’ve been stuck watching someone else’s stream.
---
You need engineering to use engineering items
---
You don't have a fucking choice
---
I think I’m missing something then. If the leader of the group doesn’t use the addon how would this benefit the person trying to find a group? Unless it would just list out whose looking for what
---
Classic WoW is one of the best introductions to the MMO genre ever made. Keep in mind, progression will be slow. Current MMOs are essentially dopamine levers with extra-fast progression and flashy skills. Current MMOs are generally not a good environment for new players because so much gets thrown at you.  
---
Note: Leveling and gear progression will be SLOW, just roll with it and enjoy the experience.
---
it annoys the shit out of me how lazy they were with the new models and didn't even make different faces for the humans
---
He has lvl 60 pvp titles :)
---
That pretty much settles it then. Thank you!
---
so their less popular product can be seen and presented as successful. On Classic launch that'll clearly be classic, but down the line when retail gets a new xpac it'll be vice versa. It helps the brand overall I'd say.
---
In Party Chat the party leader should not be specified it should just say Party. In Vanilla only the Raid Leader was specified while in Raid chat
---
Iirc he said that he's not trying to like race though, just level fast when he does play. From a post/clip a while ago
---
I finally see what you’re saying in the last two. I really just notice the rolling though. I wonder if this will be fixed.
---
Thats exactly what i meant and basically explained.
---
Layering essentially makes it possible for a single server to support more players than it would normally so that when tourists drop off and layering is merged then everyone who  are left will be literally on the same  layer and world and the population doesnt drop off dramatically.
---
I dont think losing your name is a problem with layering, since it all happens within your specific server so nobody else can have the same name as you anyway.
---
The original way of population congestion control was adding queue time to a server (and probably to control hardware stress too idk) so  that not too  many people are populating the world at the sametime so its easier to do quests.
---
If they did that now(without layering)... the queue times on launch would be humongous! And some servers might end up being rather empty after tourists leave and most people arent willing to reroll since leveling a character actually is quite time-consuming and thus your attachment to the character is stronger.
---
Right now tho layering seems to reduce queue times alot... since once a population of a single layer reaches its limit = a new layer is formed and the people who are in queue are let in and into that new layer.
---
No matter what skepticists say layering is good at launch. :)
---
It is just beta now tho so they might adjust the layering values too since last time i was online in the stress test-server it was almost impossible to do starting quests. Unless they want to keep that experience in (which probably would turn off alot of new players) they will have to adjust the numbers.
---
[LINK](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/429313282)  if someone wants the source!
---
You need to check base stat aswell for each race. Some have way more str and stam than other.
---
Tailoring isn't that useful for you. If you look at engineering and enchanting, you could maybe take both and make an alt with mining and tailoring.... Just an idea.
---
Lot's of immediate gratification infants on the Internets these days. Luckily those whiners will last two or three days tops in WoW Classic LOL
---
Recent example: Auto Chess was a Dota2 mod that got really popular a few months ago. Every single streamer was playing it. It was "the new Dota" in terms of a mod offshoot of a popular game overtaking the original's popularity. About a month into its popularity Twitch gave it a separate category.
---
You are absolutely right, this has already been tested on beta to be true
---
A few days ago I wasn't excited. Thought it was probably just the nostalgia. Then I seen a beta thingy and got interested. Started watching a few videos. Next I was looking up classes. What professions. Reading up on forums. I'm probably gonna burn my self out before the games even released. I've done that so many times. I was so hyped for witcher 3 and then I like completely forget it released. Only finally got it a few weeks ago.
---
Thanks dude!
---
I played at the VERY end of BC and more into Wrath. But I was in middle school at the time and didn't really know what I was doing. The only time I've played WoW even semi-seriously was actually Pandaria.
---
Wrath is where this "slippery slope" that keeps getting mentioned started being built.
---
Phasing started
---
You could fly even before level 80
---
LFD
---
Multiple raid modes
---
Professions gutted
---
Class homogenization comes on STRONG
---
Weak overall raid effort between sending Naxx out again and the really crappy TotGC
---
These are the ones that stand out to me and makes my verdict "kinda shitty" your mileage may vary
---
I wasn't sure if they added or just linked them. But I had the feeling that they were added.
---
Why'd you cut out the dates? https://i.imgur.com/GkN2jVo.png
---
I hate liars
---
Clearly they actually didn't play it
---
I wanna say NA hasn't seen a non-streamer, non-F&amp;F invite wave go out for the closed beta in over a week.
---
That mixed with the blue coming out and saying invites are rapidly decreasing has at least made me check a lot less often. :(
---
It completely depends on if I like the person in question or not. I'm quite sure that a lot of other guilds will have the same mentality, so I wouldn't have any concerns if I were you.
---
Though, if you're going to play on EU, we could stay in contact :)
---
Having at least one laser-throwing chicken around is a must IMO.
---
Buncha pussies, the lot of em!!
---
Could be just a smaller server, since I think it was a % but I don't know how that was actually handled. So it might've just calculated to 1 even post change I guess
---
I did not wait. I just did not have time before the weekend to edit and post the video. The theory about Blizzard splitting people in groups is not mine but I just wanted to reflect onto it, but the point of this post was just to share my experience with You all. Hope You don't mind that.
---
Engineering and mining to feed it
---
Outland is just as instanced as Kalimdor or the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
As a game dev, the ONLY difference I see is that before, the gryphon used to bank turns (the YAW of the gryphon changed based on its change in z rotation) and now, the yaw of the gryphon is locked at zero.    That -should- be EXTREMELY easy for the blizz devs to fix and I really hope they do :D it is a little bit of extra juice and polish that will look nice !!   It also shouldnt affect anything else in the game so little change of introducing bugs, its purely cosmetic !
---
preach ❤️
---
you are a hunter that can’t even take half the mob’s hp bar before having to melee, and then getting smacked by the trogg while you pathetically hit it with your axe, to 10 levels later you can kite it with a slow, dot, instant ranged nuke, with a bear to tank all the damage.
---
if that’s not class identity earned, nothing is
---
Can’t wait to make new friends in classic!
---
I’m in a similar situation except I quit at Pandaria.
---
2019 and alt-tabbing? wheres your second monitor? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Aw haha I definitely would be, but NA here.
---
But he dont work for blizzard anymore, so it's nothing more than an assumption from his part. You cant relay on that
---
If all it does is scan what people are looking for in chat it would never be mandatory, it would be a slight convenience.
---
An another blue said what I said. So it's true. Or not. They're confused.

I tried to login off and on for over 5 hours before I got to actually play. I made it to the character creation screen a few times and could create a character but failed to make it into the world. Multiple times I got to the realm list screen and DC'd as well. I was slightly annoyed but I know that it served a purpose and I'm not a popular streamer, so I had a feeling I wouldn't be a priority.
---
I can see you're on some weird mission. I hope it makes you feel better about yourself. Your comment history in your profile is extremely revealing. Best of luck with that :) I'm done after this comment.
---
In a Top-5 raiding guild from launch through BC. 2nd through BWL. Full judgement. The whole nine yards. It’s a different time now, just want to tinker with my gnome mage main and dwarf rogue alt a few hours per week.
---
Agreed with #1. The rest shows how bad you are.
---
I think we need to care and take notice about these "little" things, because they all add up and at the end of the day we all want an authentic experience otherwise what's the point?
---
Cool!
---
I'm definitely in the same boat; I like a lot of classes and have gotten a handful from 10-30 here over the past few weeks.  I'm aiming for support/healing, but haven't yet been able to decide from Druid/Priest and recently rolled a Warlock and a Shaman which are turning out to be equally as fun.
---
Still have a couple months to make up my mind, but jeesh!  I do want to support as my role so I may back off the warlock/mage/hunter I have rolled and focus on trying to pick between the druid and priest.  
---
Thanks for that insight!
---
Personally, I might well give it a week or two before I even start playing. Start zones are going to be crazy for at least a week I would guess. The only people that NEED to be there are the people going for realm first, or whatever. I'll let them have it.
---
Yeah, the streamer issue is big too and going to cause a real abnormal population slant. You know, when they first starting doing the x-realm zones (before it was properly "sharding") I really didn't get why they didn't just merge realms. Aside from saving face, because it would be an admission that active players were dropping.
---
I'd have to say that, sure using layering during launch. Keep it enabled if streamer realms become crazy. But for those realms that lose population. Suck it up, and do a merge, or free transfer off to a realm of your choice. Then close it.
---
I used to play on a realm that was REALLY busy, up until the end of wrath. In cata it became a total ghost town. By that I mean often having double digit players online during peak times. So, I re-rolled elsewhere and eventually even transferred some over. Really don't want to see that happening again long term.
---
It's a tough problem though I'll admit. The playerbase just isn't the same as it was when this was released first time round.
---
What are you on about?
---
I’ll give you that skipping flight points shouldn’t be a thing, but having to retalk to the flight master every leg of your flight path journey was fucking retarded. It was fixed in Vanilla and existed in Vanilla longer than xrealm bgs did and those are in Vanilla, so...
---
Hey, thanks for contributing... like you have with several other negative comments recently about wow classic. Incase this is too difficult for you, you’re the person we are glad isn’t playing classic. Good luck with being you though.
---
Yes exactly! Purely immersive and cool to see, you're soaring through the air and not just sitting there ! Hope they fix it, hopefully it's as easy as that!
---
Well why? Blizzard gets to look like their game is popping off all the sudden, no chance in hell they’d want to make it clear to everyone who doesn’t already know what’s going on - what’s going on. Right now on twitch it looks, to the standard passer by, that bfa is somehow doing well again all of the sudden. Would be a waste to squander the cross promotion.
---
They are re creating a previous (better) version of the game so yeah everything needs to be as close as possible no matter how small it may seem on the surface.
---
This seems to be quite divisive.
---
Exactly my thoughts! :) But I hope I'll be in another group for the next stress test haha
---
Didn't instantly clear content, disappointed. /s
---
Exactly, thank you!
---
My first thought, lol.
---
You 5e whippersnappers got it way too easy.
---
Back in my day we had Magic Missile, and it was a first level spell!  It did 1d4+1 damage, and we liked it that way!
---
Which classes are the 4 you have in mind?
---
I mean if they fixed it that would be cool, but honestly this seems like it should be really far down the priority list. Seems to me with all the bugs people are finding on the Beta they are already going to have their hands full if we are really looking at a late Aug release.
---
I have this same name on illidan :o
---
Who says I like you?
---
amen brother
---
You can multi dot trash that you know won't be focused. There are also some bosses where multi dotting is possible. But yeah, for the most part, you won't be dotting bosses.
---
I was never as serious or as good as what you were, but what you’re saying you want to do now is what I want to do. I want to roll a hunter, enjoy the leveling experience and get some friends that I met during classic that I’m still friends with today back into the game. Should be fun, and very relaxed.
---
Use an addon
---
said to me by my friend, when I quite WoW the first time, 11 years ago.
---
He was right. I've come back like 4 times.
---
Wow nice 600-500 bc etruscan boar vessel.
---
I played vanilla a little before aq started its events. I play through it until bc started.  Never did any raiding with any level of regularity beyond bwl. I would get invited sometimes for soul stones to other things.
---
or just add flying to vanilla so we ride our own mounts with better immersion
---
It's pretty common to go through someone's comment history looking for a reason to discredit their opinions once you've realized you suck at making your point. Hopefully in the future, you won't have to lie and exaggerate to feel comfortable making a point :) See ya!
---
I would wager 9999 people in 10000 wouldn't notice. It's such an irrelevance.
---
I'd rather they focus on important stuff.
---
"  We’ll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process.  "
---
Hopefully this part goes towards our side :D ! Fingers crossed.
---
if you min max yes otherwise not really...... well except for priests.
---
# '' I'm just not sure inexperienced people are going to be happy with the grind once they realize how far behind they fall.''
---
If they can stomach the AP grind that much. They'll be fine with Classic. Just saying. Blizzard is getting players addicted to grind. And hey. Classic rewards you for your grinding efforts. Not like the other game.
---
Damn, I do hope you find a nice guild where you feel at home anyway :D
---
On guild creation, how many ranks does a guild have, what are they called, and how are they ordered (top to bottom)?
---
Is it 5 ranks, named and ordered exactly like this?
---
* Leader
---
* Officer
---
* Veteran
---
* Member
---
* Initiate

Shard management is fixed -&gt; [https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/archive/v0.2.zip](https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/archive/v0.2.zip)
---
How most of the EU playerbase feels tbh
---
I read it as "don't hold your breath"
---
Changing specs is also available for an increasing fee so really it only hurts healers (and tanks to some extent).
---
I get why dual specc isn't an option but in vanilla all support classes had to level dps alts to sustain themselves for raiding.
---
Is it better to level with gathering professions so you can make gold? But then you have to spend a lot of time at 60 leveling up your crafting. I’m not familiar with this dynamic in vanilla since I started in BC and didn’t really pay attention to professions until LK.
---
This so much.
---
TBC babies want you to think 25m raids is the end all be all to raiding
---
We also had 20 mans in vanilla mever forget
---
We might have to flip a coin =/
---
OP, I don’t even think you need reasons, explanations, or just justifications for wanting this changed. It’s clearly wrong and “bugged” and we should very realistically expect blizz to fix this before launch. It would be disgraceful if they didn’t. I assume it’s on their radar.
---
I understand that, and then it makes sense. But, when I said that I was talking about current retail realms (which you have to accept is what their current hardware solution is set up to serve).
---
It's an idea at least. That is to use layering to cram more players onto a single realm, such that when the hype dies down there will be enough to still fill a single layer, but not become empty. Which is fine.
---
But, you know with streamers and the big guilds.. There's going to be some realms for which layering can't be turned off. There's also undoubtedly going to be some realms that lose the game and end up with a low pop regardless. I know, I played on one, back when players seemed to flock to a few select realms back in early cata. I don't know if they can solve that without either merging realms, free transfers off and closing the realm or some solution that would be miles away from the classic experience (sharding for example).
---
Layering if done right.. Might be a stopgap for the start. If it can be abused... That will be a problem.
---
I bought the vanilla dungeon guide &amp; atlas also off e-bay for like $12 each. great purchase and they are in full color
---
varies from class to class. I would say by the time you get your first or second big class quest skill unlocked. For warlocks by the time you unlike i think the succubus is the second quest demon.
---
They have been putting a lot of work into doing things like tweaking the lighting engine to look as vanilla-ish as they can At the Blizzcon panel last year they were showing side-by-side comparisons of the reference client to Classic and changes that they made to get it to look right. 
---
Given that, I assume that they will be fixing this as well - it's probably just a lower priority.
---
What's wrong with spriest?
---
Maybe people like you should go play whack-a-mole with added flashing lights and pull levers where a treat is inserted into your mouth.
---
That makes so much sense, thanks for clearing that up!
---
Awesome!
---
How did this get broken? Did they remove the Gryphon's Roll and Pitch axis in retail or something?
---
let me in
---
I get it, I was trying to make a joke.
---
There are only so many ways to get there and they have all been explored already.
---
Given the mad dash I expect everyone to be making through Goldshire/Westfall/Duskwood/Redridge I think I'm going to stay in Kalimdor.
---
I honestly don't know how "efficient" Teldrassil&gt;Darkshore&gt;Ashenvale&gt;Menethil Harbor is, but not having to really compete for quest mobs and resource nodes make me feel it's not a terrible idea.
---
As I'll be leveling a priest I can always find myself a VC group, get summoned, run to Sentinel Hill to set my hearthstone and continue questing in the Eastern Kingdoms if Kalimdor isn't working out. 
---
From what I see here so many people are going to be rushing Goldshire and beyond. Given slow respawn times, no shared quest item drops, and no shared mob tagging it might be slow going in those early areas.
---
I understand! Sorry for the bluntness, I guess the doubt was legit but as I am not into the Beta I couldn't very easily replicate that right now. I'm in the stress test though so I could try replicate it even better but I think it's clear enough now. As long as we're all talking like gentlemen, again, I'm all for double-checking!
---
I’d rather classic be that new MMO. Update the game with player voted features that are in line with classic ideology.
---
Wow that is nice OP! 👍
---
No-lifed vanilla release until the end of WotLK. There's no way in hell I can dedicate as much time now (almost 30), but I still intend to raid a few times a week.
---
When you hit max level (5) quests reward gold instead of xp! ;)
---
I opened it thinking "how bad can it be?". You were right. It's so bad it's good!
---
\&gt;fraction
---
accurate cringe
---
added comparison to help seeing the differences
---
If they add dual spec ( which I don't but I'm not necessarily against) the upfront cost would have to be equal to like two or three months of swapping spec twice a week. It should take a while to start saving gold vs just respeccing normally
---
Outland is not instanced. It's like saying Kalimdor is instanced because it doesn't belong to Eastern Kingdoms
---
He's so damn right, especially about future potential expansions after Classic has been out for long enough. Blizzard needs to try and stare away from repeating retail's fate, and stick to the 'pillars of Classic,' basically.
---
The moment I read about it being a small beta I allready stoped expecting an invite. Then the first waves came in and it was almost exclusively NA players, apart from content creators. Thats when I knew there was no freaking way I would get an invite.
---
Great catch. Did you submit this?
---
It's funny because during wrath everyone hated it and it wasn't until a few years later that everyone suddenly loved it.
---
You're worried about this for immersion, but they're "layering" 95% of your server's population in a duplicate that you will never see.
---
Thank you for the support! I'm glad the reaction is mostly positive, but it's legit to add proof to those concerns after all
---
its very strong, and it can compete with *Combat Swords.* On stationary fights, *Daggers* win. But when you have to move then *Swords* get the upperhand.  
---
So in all and all, its the same. Even CD and rotation is almost identical. But Daggers might be easier to comeby in early MC, and personally when its on a pvp server i like combat dagger more.
---
I feel like it started being doable with 5 once you had a few BWL items + MC gear. Or maybe even just full MC gear.  I can't remember any particular class comp being required.
---
i think streamsniping is and isnt an issue, like yeah sure you goto a streamer yoink them once and kinda shit stir a little thats one thing, but when youre the kind of person who just has this seething hatred for streamers for some absurd reason that you need to go out of your way to ruin their day you really need to re-evaluate yourself and your questionable personality, i dont care for streamers, i dont really like or dislike them theyre just a thing that exist but i dont think people that ive seen on this thread and subreddit who just have this seething hatred need to exist in any way.
---
Dagger builds are a bit harder to play. Swords are also better dps until your extremely geared then daggers start to pull ahead.
---
You could watch youtube videos of playstyles and have a pretty firm understanding of your interest level before you start leveling. That's what I do anyways
---
No way, watch your favorite streamer, laugh when they insult people, imitate them and perpetuate the toxicity.
---
Can’t wait to make some dope twink accounts with classic gear again.
---
Level 1 wizard, best chance they had solo against a wolf was color spray or sleep. Of course the super weak early levels got outweighed by the God-like power of high level. . . if you could live that long lol
---
YES FINALLY, I see someone else who agrees with me, you said it so much better too!
---
Having 5 FPS and not being able to kill anything did far worse for immersion. No way you can feel like an adventurer if your adventure is a powerpoint presentation.
---
Ah yes, horde: the virgin faction
---
The first time I noticed flight point mounts behave like this was somewhere in WotLK and it has annoyed me since then.
---
Dwarf priests do matter in vanilla for fear ward.
---
I'm pretty sure I did while on the stress test, but I'm not on the beta :/ So I wanted to raise a bit of awareness, so it can get noticed by blizz. Maybe they already did notice, who knows !
---
Tbc was great but lore wise it was horrible.
---
You have to roll to hit with that spell though.  So before you roll 1d10 you roll a d20.  Whereas a traditional spell you use it and it eats a spell slot and the target has to make a saving throw more akin to older versions.
---
While I do not doubt you, all the videos you provide as "Evidence" are either taken during TBC, or Alpha/Beta/Promotional footage and not actual footage from Vanilla.
---
The first video is from 2007, obviously TBC, not vanilla.
---
The second video is a promotional video released by Blizzard, and that is not enough as Blizzard have promised many things in promotional media that they ended up never having.
---
And you 2006 edit video was released on Dec 26, 2006, which is after the 2.0.1 patch came out. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1
---
If you can provide video evidence that is actually from vanilla up to 1.12.2 then your claims would have more weight.
---
Well then it's a good thing him and everyone else like him can stay in modern WoW where everything other than high-end raids and M+ is an absolute effortless joke.
---
alright thanks man! I am really excited to try dagger rogue and nolife classic
---
I mean i think there should have been a better inbetween option for nolifing and casual.
---
I raided all the content and stepped foot into Naxx, but i wouldn't say I no lifed it.
---
Music checks out. This is vanilla.
---
Imagine not being able to oneshot mobs from lvl 1. These people I swear
---
I mean, I'm talking from a sort of lore standpoint. In-game guards can be godlike in power.
---
Wholesome!
---
Well you're not wrong. Especially when entertaining streamers bring in the Classic beta content, it makes us all even more hyped!
---
Druid doesn’t really ever get to be a cat or bear or offensive caster in raids. It’s healing and buffing and Innervate for them.
---
Shaman doesn’t really ever get to be a DPS spec in raids. It’s healing and totems for them.
---
Paladin doesn’t really ever get to be a tank or DPS spec in raids. It’s healing and buffing for them.
---
Priest doesn’t really ever get to be a DPS spec in raids. It’s healing and buffing for them.
---
The thing is, that's the same argument the retail community that didn't want classic used; why fragment a community and upkeep 2 MMOs?
---
If they went this path, it would be kinda unfair to those who prefer other versions to vanilla to be told that they cannot play them
---
Elephant in the room that's currently being pushed aside? What? Are you crazy? lmao
---
A good raider is one that shows up on time to the raid.
---
Very interesting question indeed! I've never raided myself so I'm curious to hear what the pros have to say. Great thread there, OP.
---
I disagree. Taking 2 1/2 hours to do a quest that takes only 30 minutes is definitely wasted time. That's why we have things like Zygor.
---
good point
---
No!
---
I agree with you.
---
The usual advice for your situation is to level up with Skinning and either Herbalism or Mining, and then when you get level 60 or close to it, switch to Engineering (and possibly Mining). That is not what I intend to do, but that is the advice I see a lot of people give.
---
With that said, you can get by perfectly fine and clear all PvE content and play PvP just fine even if you never take up any primary profession.
---
Primary professions - you can take up to 2
---
* Alchemy
---
* Blacksmithing
---
* Enchanting
---
* Engineering
---
* Leatherworking
---
* Tailoring
---
* Herbalism (gathering)
---
* Mining (gathering)
---
* Skinning (gathering)
---
Secondary professions - you can take as many as you want
---
* Cooking
---
* First Aid
---
* Fishing (gathering)
---
Yes! I knew something was off. XD
---
are you the curator? do you plan on adding more over time? followed regardless. good stuff here.
---
Yeah the arena is free for all.
---
And the chest spawns every 3 hours giving you a good reason to step inside and fight for it
---
Possibly controversial opinion: the game was better than it was bad till Warlords. 
---
Whilst certain things were frustrating lots of things were fun, as you got burned out with one expac a new one came and had some new things to try out.
---
Warlords onwards is where the game became more frustrating than fun, and everything except raiding became just dull.
---
Legion had some fun content but required you to jump through too many hoops imo.
---
Them SW women are elitist snobs who like to fart in the tub.
---
Both resto druids and holy priests will be needed, but at least from my Vanilla experience a lot of people were hesitant to bring druids to 5 mans simply due to the lack of a rez. And in a raid setting you only need a few druids so spots are competitive.
---
I had a druid and I loved him given the playstyle, but at the end of the day my priest was my main.
---
I didn't play my lock much and didn't roll a shaman till BC hit, as I'm an alliance player. However, I had an absolute blast with my shaman and he was my "main" alt through all of BC. 
---
Shaman were really looked down upon, espically for BC heroics due to their lack of CC, but if you knew how to play the class you did have some decent CC (frost shock/earthbind kite, OT/kite with a shield and rockbitter) and I remember changing a lot of people's opinions about shaman.
---
Please dont use Mark Kern, that guy is scum.
---
how many addons you download
---
It’s all good dude, we’re all trying to accomplish the same thing here. 
---
Good eye too, this is one of those nuanced things that probably aren’t caught by many, but do indeed take away from the level of immersion if missing.
---
You could probably get someone with beta access to upload their config file and you could use it to set your key bindings early.
---
You'd just have to swap it with the one that the release version if the game makes for you.
---
Daggers require you to behind the target which is harder in solo play. Swords is just a bit "easier".
---
I am 28 and not in a position to no life any longer (got a son of 1 year now too). So, I will take things easy and not rush it. I will just enjoy the questing and immerse myself as much as possible. 
---
Think around 4-6 hours a week, maybe longer if I get some spare time in the weekends :)
---
as opposite to:
---
tagging every wolf in 3 seconds they all die in 1 hit end up finishing the quest in 20 seconds...
---
.... 1 *day*  later your already max level with decked out gear.
---
But wait,  didnt you just pay 15 euros/dollars for a *month* of gametime? (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
---
Fair enough. When I mean casually I just meant somewhere between super casual and very light raiding. I wanted to trim down the options as much as possible while getting the selections somewhat close to the experience level.
---
Look at the downvoted this really hit on some people on the head :D
---
Ive been taking that into consideration but thanks for the good advice!
---
&gt;I've come back like 4 times.
---
Pfft, just 4? Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers up!
---
I've deleted and restored my characters countless of times, and have quit at least twice per each expansion.
---
That said, the game as it is right now is nothing like it was so I really need to *force* myself to play it, but Classic is going to be that 101% pure fucking meth that even Walter White will be unable to produce.
---
^(Disclaimer: I have never and will never use drugs.)
---
Speaking as a mage in vanilla, have tons of water and food in your bags ahead of raid time and mana gems of each rank. And open portals at the end of every group.
---
It's in Guild Wars 2
---
I know that, I was just responding to your question based on how the previous commented; that Outland is not part of the main world. Technically, everything is instanced, worlds are just huge instances with no player caps.
---
MEME OF THE YEAR
---
Daggers are fine and marginally worse than swords unless you play human. 
---
what you’re not factoring is drop rates. I played a fresh pserver raided MC and BWL up until around the time AQ was released. and our guild saw two viskag’s drop and 3 brutality blades. We also saw one perd blade and 2 core hound tooth’s. We saw no CTS and no maladath in like 8-9 resets of BWL. Your guild may get unlucky with drops. We ran with like 5-6 rogues and 4-5 fury warriors. Most our rogues still had dal rends set into BWL and only two of our warriors had the viskags and the rest were dal rends. My rogue had a Brut blade and Mirahs song and I did pretty close to top damage as a human, definitely not optimal set up but you can only take what drops you get
---
all about oozing them purp daddies with the occasional orange
---
Showing up on time, prepared and knowledgeable about the fights. Listening.
---
To start...
---
Showing up on time having all your consumables ready.
---
Spending the time to go get pre-raid bis.
---
There is a big difference, it isn't bfa in this regard.
---
42 feralas.  If you make it through there with a class, you’ll be good.
---
Kargoz's rogue guide should be taken with a grain of salt, he spends a large amount of time on "Front Stabbing" which is a private server bug, not possible in Classic.
---
I love it.
---
Yeah I have been loving how accuratley they are representing the original world, I hope they do fix it!
---
On horde daggers is very weak in pve because of windfury totem, since daggers hit for less the procs do less damage and windfury has a 3seconds "cooldown". This means you basically only go dagger IF you are a pvper that gets all the big daggers first. So yeah if you have perdition blade + domo dagger versus prebis swords obviously you go dagger, but the optimal setup is gonna be swords.
---
Ally: If you play human then obviously swords is superior. For non-humans dagger is pretty good, again it depends a bit on gear setup,  and what raids are out. If it's MC only then perdition blades is sick, if BWL then chrom sword is too good, if AQ40 then cthundagger is bis.
---
Im going to agreed alot with sable17 ''  A good raider is one that shows up on time to the raid.  '' 
---
Also being prepared with potions and flask right enchants etc etc.
---
Also having the right mindset and patients is really important !
---
LMAO
---
arent basic QoL updates however minor is how we got from vanilla to Retail? little bits here and there that makes things easier. soul shards for locks, arrows for hunters, vanilla is filled with tedium and that is how it needs to stay. People dont realize tedium is why its so immersive
---
Anyone can stand in front of a dummy while doing a rotation. What separates the good from the bad is learning the fights before hand and having the ability to maintain maximum DPS efficiency while catering to the boss fight mechanics, showing up on time with the required consumables, having max professions and min/max'd gear itemization. Know the fights well enough to be able to anticipate phase shifts by positioning/saving CD's for certain times of the fight. Stuff like that
---
No big is like asmon or soda that are always at 40 to 50k viewers
---
maybe if it just disappeared. but if it had to be physically removed?
---
While I agree for the need of proof, it wouldn't make sense that the flight would be static at vanilla, then have movement in TBC, then static at some point around Cata or something. But I agree, and I'm gonna try find more proof. I'll add it to the post.
---
Too true, thank you friend.
---
Have you not noticed that even private servers eventually stagnate and die, and every time a new server launches, people flock to it. 
---
Levelling to 60 for the first time again, going through all the content patches in order, playing and experiencing a fresh economy and community. That's what most people are after, but once the game hits 1.12, once Naxx is cleared, once your characters are geared, most people lose interest and the population drops off. 
---
You can't seriously believe that if the original Vanilla servers had stayed up for 15 years there would be more than a handful of active players nowadays...
---
The spike is when BFA is released, this is the beta...
---
i think the younger generations are just becoming more and more toxic. like maybe i just been on reddit too long and play too many MOBA's, but i can easily see a caster these days Need Rolling on a tank item or something just cause you pissed him off earlier in the dungeon. but i remember Vanilla as being *0%* toxic. like nothing at all.
---
Let the war begin.
---
That’s not how the internet works! Is it?!?
---
The boss dying should be a freebie. Meters is where the fun is
---
Don’t forget Seal Fate daggers that pulls away from both specs once you reach crit cap (around AQ gear) and is very much better for PVP.
---
That thumbnail is beautiful...man that snow looks nice
---
Consistency really. Doing your rotation or whatever is easy as hell. A good raider is one that shows up, shows up prepared, doesn't make mistakes often, and keeps high dps uptime.
---
Nobody looked cool in vanilla until the tail end, and they were dedicated raiders or PvPers in GM gear.
---
This does not bother anyone. Youre mostly tabbed or WC when ur flying. 
---
I worry more about animations not working as intended such as strafing.
---
Other than that the beta look like 10/10
---
3 days later and link still not working. hmm :(
---
Asmon and Soda should not be the bar set for if you're big. They are the exceptions in that they are the equivalent of "superstars"

If you consistently pull 3k+ viewers even early in the morning, you're big.
---
Agreed, Classic WoW was largely learning how to wisely and effectively use your resources which is what made the game so fun and challenging. I remember having to calculate how many fireballs/frostbolts I allowed myself to cast per mob and using my wand/melee to kill.
---
I made one, [too!](https://open.spotify.com/album/3McPVq1RT8F2ERSiajR3WS?si=VcUkjCxTSs2BdWV7Wo_LDQ)
---
They're just sour cause they're game sucks now
---
I had to go away the same day as the Stresstest ended. So i will be in the same shoes tomorrow
---
In my drop down menu it said like Beta&amp;Stresstest. Was is the same for you guys? 
---
Stay strong, brothers! August is coming!
---
Yes thx Maexna for your sword &lt;3
---
You can just die as soon as you see green land. Rez in Menethil Harbor. Will save 5mins of swimming.
---
Ow look, classic fanboy with a tone def reply that doesnt reply to any of the things i wrote. Amazing
---
This comment is full of excellent advice! Thank you, upvoted.
---
I don't think they are going to do anything about UI stuff that does not directly impact the gameplay
---
Ulduar and ICC at consider d some of the best raids of any mmo ever, but the “raids are weak.” Saying “it started a slippery slope” is technically true, but it’s sort of like blaming ghengis khan for the colonization of Africa by the west. 
---
Phasing only affected tiny portions of zones and were mostly aesthetic. IDK if you’re confusing it for sharding? You could fly at 78/79, rather than 80. 
---
If anything professions were gutted in BC.
---
Care to give some examples of class homogenization?
---
Inform yourself before posting stupid shit, thank you.
---
No No!
---
There were several redos of flight paths as I recall. 
---
Not sure why they would touch animation but when they would add flight paths they would also take the time to add more efficient rides. 
---
I remember patch notes to that effect. 
---
I’m cool with them either way. But I’m pretty sure that’s why it was done.
---
No neckbeard?
---
i honestly cat remember if they tilted or not, i would recommend testing with the same FP as the vanilla videos just in case its an issue with certain points of the flight and not an actual bug
---
Being a nice guy, knowing trash/Boss strategies,being in the dungeon in Time,keeping your raidbuffs up.
---
Furthermore optimize your gear with enchants and have consumables ready (a good raider will have them even for his mates).
---
Keeping a high attendace long term.
---
Communicate and give advice.
---
Insight: giving streamers Beta access helps with bug fixing because it gets thousands of eyeballs examining hours of documentable footage.
---
You have to first experience all of tbc and all of Wrath grounded first. Only at max level could you fly.
---
So I'm not 100% sure, but it does appear that the griffon is missing animations.  I wonder if it's because flight points now use so many models for flying mounts instead of just griffons that the animation became more "generic"?
---
TBH having limited time would just make it so much sweeter when you do get to play make sure you have him helping with professions as soon as he can !
---
It's subjective to retail forums, you will get a lot of BFA lovers on there. I wouldnt take it personal
---
Yeah you're right, they just keep the same animation and are pulled along on the rail. Please report this bug.
---
I wish i could see, feels like watching something beeing drunk. Its remarkable how spoiled we have gotten with quality
---
&gt; yeah it was unfair, lol but shit, thats the point.
---
Nah. It was the cross-faction twink guild rivalries that it was all about. Back at the height of my twinking days we used to meet up in Rachet to duel for bragging rights.
---
Is the undead racial the best in game for PvP? I never played vanilla, thought it’d be Orcs or humans (until you just mentioned humans didn’t have the same racial).
---
That all makes sense!  Druid/Priest are in my top slot so far--still trying to decide which of the two I enjoy most.  However, definitely makes sense that they would be expected to play their support roles in group/raid content.
---
I am not going to be a raid-crazy person anyways; but, definitely plan on getting there to do a few at least. =)
---
I forgot about this. Retail is so easy to get around, there's no time to afk. So if your with friends your always going afk at inopportune times. Now it's "flight path brb 5-10 minutes" and no one bats an eye
---
For the challenge, for the immersion, for a stronger sense of character identity, for a different experience. I've leveled a combat sword rogue before, and this time I want to be that rogue who doesn't even train the sword skill, a rogue dedicated to the art of the daggers. It adds an RP element that I find pleasing. Yeah I'm gimping myself, but hey, it could be worse: Some people are leveling by only killing boars (and I say: power to them!) It just doesn't sit well with me to go through a long journey doing one thing, and then changing everything once you're at the end. It feels like a betrayal of your character, like: what were you training for this whole time?
---
Sorry for the rant, hope it explains my motives.
---
Have you checked this upto lvl30 quest extra gold rewards?
---
I don't mind people hopping between layers but there has to be some sort of cooldown.
---
That certainly wasn’t the case on my server. Except for TOC, which everyone shat on.
---
bad bot
---
It doesn't matter enough to choose over what looks good to you. I was a tauren dps warrior and dwarf dagger rogue and raided all the way into Naxx. The game isn't difficult enough to warrant that level of minmaxing, unless you are in a NEET "wUrLd FuRsT" guild (which you really shouldn't bother trying to be).
---
No-lifed the hell out of vanilla, can't wait to dive back in!
---
Also closer to Plaguelands for Strat/Scholo/Naxx.
---
Back when I was playing D&amp;D when classic came out, cantrips dealt 1d3 damage, and a first level wizard had 3 a day. They also had \*maybe\* 3 1st level spells, which could be... Magic Missile! for 1d4+1 damage.
---
D&amp;D has been made casual, my friend.
---
HeyOP, I’ve seen all your replies in this thread and I’m so happy to see somebody else that sees updating Classic in the Same way I do. Perhaps a player polling system for future updates could be set up the same way OSRS is.
---
No I was an Human Rogue named Tanken.  Spent most of my time trying and failing to gank people though so we might have run into each other at some point.
---
When it comes to raiding, a Druid is simply not a substitute for Warrior tanks or any DPS class. Not in the slightest.
---
How you have to finish a questline that I don't think a low level could aquire. Now in tbc I saw someone main switch off there 60 vanilla scarab Lord and that became a bank alt. So that is the only thing that makes sense.
---
So you prefer that you just phase into the new layer like sharding?
---
And to clarify, I don't mean that you should have the ritual available at all times, but just at a time when the game wants to put you in another layer. (Yes, I do realize that grouping up has the possibility of making it at will.)
---
Its normal tho, if things keep getting worse soon or later you will realize it
---
Agreed having watched them all I think he is much better than Soni/Tips et al
---
Yup. Crazy how threatened they feel by classic, constantly trying to tear it down.  Soo scared that all the achievements they farmed for years to stroke their epeen will become irrelevant
---
You could just compare to BFA and not wow BFA
---
Jagex keeps up 2 versions of Runescape and it works out fine for fans of each split, you can't say the same for 4 different versions of the game - it's literally not feasible from a business standpoint. I'm not sure why this is difficult to understand.
---
I get why you want to play BC/Wrath, but I think taking the best design philosophies from those expansions (that still feel 'Vanilla' and fall under its design pillars) would be a much better, long term approach for the 'Classic' audience, instead of a short one guaranteed to give players a quick (albeit expansion long) fix of BC/Wrath. 
---
A huge part of what makes Vanilla enjoyable for so many people is the huge, immersive world that can't be cheated by flying mounts, or isn't made smaller by an expansion that funnels everybody into a 7 zone continent with one multi-faction city. BC and Wrath change all of that.
---
I have a huge Burning Crusade poster at my desk that I got when I picked up my pre-order with my dad at midnight (and a Wrath one that got torn up while moving), I love BC but expansion-based versions of WoW are the antithesis of what the Classic community have been fighting for.
---
You don’t remember throwing your mouse across the room after the lvl 45 rogue that’s been camping you in Duskwood for 30 mins, now figured out you spirit rezzed and is camping you there now? Haha
---
Well, yeah, strictly speaking that type of animation is different from the wing-flapping and the other animations the model has, but in practice I think it's still fair to call it animation.
---
You're factually incorrect. Bear tanks out class warrior in threat per second by miles. It's the one thing bear tanks excel at over a warrior.
---
To reiterate: you're wrong. Extremely wrong,and you should be embarrassed.
---
End of the day, everyone wins.
---
Classic players get to play Classic.
---
Blizzard gets a massive sub boost
---
Live (probably) sees an improved game due to Classic experiences and increased sub numbers.
---
People who hate live &amp; Classic can just hate two things now.
---
&gt; But what are the main drawbacks of daggers?
---
You need to be behind your target to get backstabs/ambushes off. Swords/Maces does not have that requirement. This means that when you play solo, you need to devote more energy towards keeping the enemy from turning towards you (Gouge, Kidney Shot) so you can go all stabby on their asses, which means you also need to be pooling energy. Sword (and mace/fist) rogues just need to spam Sinister Strike. That said...
---
&gt;  Is it really that big of a disadvantage in endgame pve?
---
...It is not. Melee needs to be flanking raid mobs anyhow, because if they attack from the front, they incur something called "Parry Haste": If you parry an attack, the swing timer until your next weapon swing gets hasted, i.e. you attack sooner after having parried an attack. This means that melee that attack from the front indirectly increase the damage output every time their attack gets parried. Additionally, a lot of mobs cleave and/or have some form of cone attack, which you will want to avoid.
---
In short: In endgame PvE, melee players will be flanking most of the time anyhow, so swords lose the positional advantage they hold in solo PvE.
---
Run 5 mans and get your BIS. After that you can raid or start your pvp grind when it’s out
---
WotF will never be as strong as Hardiness.  
---
Orc racial will dominate WotF every day of the weak in PvP. End of discussion.
---
The dot gets overwritten by itself and does 1 damage per tick. I don't think there's much reason to count it.
---
In vanilla, half the battle took place outside the instance before raid time. Good / dedicated players spent time farming materials for pots and craftable gear etc. It was also much less about knowing your rotation and more about knowing what your class brought to the raid and contributed specifically to the boss you're on. For example hunters needed to know how to kite on certain fights, warlocks needed to keep track of curses and banishes, dps warriors were often on standby to emergency OT if needed, etc. Vanilla boss encounters are pretty simple when you boil it down to their mechanics and your rotation, the real difficulty comes from coordinating the raid inside and outside the instance.
---
cya in an hour :D
---
Salt is delicious and so are virgins. Git you sum!
---
Duengeons like everyone else
---
Makes me have a hard time choosing my character cause I want to play everything, vs retail "I don't really wanna play anything"
---
Aight, i tried searching when for BiS Pre raid gear but had 0 luck. Any websites that are good too look for or?
---
I would say 25. 1-20 gives you a good idea of the leveling pace, I think those extra 5 levels take a bit longer and allow you to experience some dungeons/PvP/wpvp/class kit
---
Actually, in the version I posted, he only talks of sword leveling and doesn't mention frontstabbing at all. I think it's an updated version made for classic. You are right though as far as older versions of his guide that I've seen, frontstabbing was something he covered... but even then it doesn't invalidate the rest of the guide.
---
Be early. Have consumables prepped beforehand. Be ready to help other players. Be sociable and friendly in downtime, and focused and attentive in combat. Master your rotation. Optimise gear and talent choices.
---
The biggest challenge in Classic is not the raw numbers and mechanics (though they do matter), the biggest challenge is getting 20-40 people to work together for 5+ hours straight. Even if you're the top DPS and you show up an hour early to every raid: if you are a beligerent arsehole who drives other players away, or prolings downtime by starting fights in chat, you are a bad raider.
---
In PvE, no. They offer marginal advantages but nothing big enough that you'll not get into raids or anything like that.
---
In PvP they are more important, they can often be the difference between living and dying.
---
Don´t remind me... Now I have to check.
---
BfA has been one of the most watched games on Twitch. M+ has a lot of viewer retention and the world first race has pulled hundreds of thousands of viewers. 
---
Plus seeing the difference between classic and BfA viewers would be useful for Blizzard. No reason they wouldn't split them up.
---
its the retail clowns in full blown denial facing the potential irrelevancy of their favorite game
---
It is also effective marketing.  Anyone complaining about streamers getting access is just bitter they aren't a full time gamer themselves.
---
I’m rolling Tauren shaman. Everyone will tell me I’m a scrub for not going orc cause hardiness is so op in PvP. I’d rather have a stun.
---
Thank you, we need side by side comparisons. Not that the ones OP provided weren't good, but this was something someone could easily replicate with beta that should have been done in the original post. Especially when we are trying to provide proof something is different. You should keep everything else constant to show a change in behavior.
---
They matter but not that much. If you have to question whether it's worth to get the right racials then it probably is not.
---
Anyway for tanking trolls are better.
---
I don’t recommend Priest as your first character in Classic if this is your first foray into Vanilla WoW. At least not unless you have a partner. Leveling as priest is fine. A bit slow until later and entirely too dependent on wands, but Shadowform makes up for it. The problem is hitting 60. You’ll either go Holy to be competitive in end-game dungeons and raids or you’ll stay Shadow to keep questing and farming. Doing both is prohibitively expensive until several months or even a year into the game.
---
#Darnassus2020
---
This irks you eh
---
it's painfully obvious you haven't done any raiding in vanilla
---
Just stop
---
The reason I mentioned the cooldown was to not hamper grouping but it might be necessary.
---
Marty, we have to go back.
---
Well, sorry. I just recently got myself an PC that can actually handle modern games, earlier I was using some 2009 notebook from Sony, so you know... slowly but surely will get the 2nd monitor. Maybe when people will be playing with googles on their heads I will be like "Hey... I just got myself 2nd monitor" and you will be like "@nd monitor in 2029? where are your super-immersive-9d-googles?" ;)
---
that was amazing
---
being useful when it's time for Wpvp
---
It's mages time to shine in 40 v 40 plus
---
Bonus if they repaired their gear and brought their consumables for the DPS burn fight
---
Go Combat, and run as many dungeons as you can.
---
Yes
---
its actually more noob-friendly than bfa. 
---
Classic has no timegates other than weekly raid lockout. There are content patches but those patches will not completely negate the previous gear. (it might make them less desirable but not significantly)
---
And there arent really any other time specific things that require you to be fast or youll lose out.
---
I liked it at first, the rotations and things you have to keep in mind like Condition and Durability. After 10 hours it was still fun, after 50 it became whatever and after 100 hours it legitimately made me annoyed to craft. HQ being vastly superior in terms of XP also forces you to do it manually. I basically quit crafting in FF14 because in the end I actually just want to collect mats and watch a bar do the rest. :)
---
I’m sure there’s some out there. Sorry I don’t know any to help you. I usually just look at dungeon drops (used to be an addon for it right in game) or on wowhead classic and see what gear I want that suites my class/build im going for.  Then run those dungeons until I’ve gotten what I’ve wanted. Think shadowcraft set your “.05” tier set. You get that from running ubrs, lbrs, Mara, dm and can do quests to upgrade it to the second set.
---
Oh gotcha!
---
I think a lot of it has to do with people that didn't play vanilla and played much later.  They are used to shading/layering (they're the same exact thing to the end user) being part of the game.   They don't understand how greatly it impacts the server's identity and that it will never feel like a home.   No guild wpvp battles, running out of ubrs or aq to wipe an entire guild.   That won't exist or you will be able to void it.    
---
Before anyone says it's just phase 1.. no it's not.  Shading is part of how the client works.  The only way to get around it is to have single servers like that had years ago.  But that increases costs, so it ain't gonna happen.
---
Honestly, that's more like Bank Alts vs. Mains
---
There’s no jewel crafting in classic.
---
check this out,  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV\_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?sle=true#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?sle=true#)
---
There’s no Jewelcrafting in Classic, so no.
---
Not gonna play rogue, but very cool guide, upvoted.
---
Jewelcrafting was new as of burning crusade iirc.
---
Gems as in Jewelcrafting? If so, JC was not implemented until TBC.
---
It is great that both retail and classic exist. People like this can stay on BFA without hurting our game. remember retail is simply a response blizzard had to the complaints. Those who were satisfied didn't say much (other than subscribe) and as a result our voice wasn't heard. Now when people complain about classic they can just go to retail :). everyones happy.
---
Why would Blizzard choose Classic boosting WoW numbers on twitch for literal competition for it?  
---
I mean, its pretty obvious.
---
I remember being in IF for ubrs runs mc, bwl, 10m strathholm most of what was happening was up north
---
Usually players migrate in the oppsite direction: Darkshore is a very large location with extremely uncomfortable to level up zones. I always moved to Westfall =&gt; Redridge =&gt; Duskwood after completing questing in Teldrassil.
---
I doubt people will notice it as much as the fps are the same on live, so they are used to it but it's a bit of an odd thing, it looks better but I can't figure out why it was removed or changed. 
---
Did they change flight path speeds at some point and the animations didn't look good at a different speed and removed them altogether ?
---
This would be a good explanation, so helicopters and all wouldn't tilt like a gryphon? Honestly like the idea, we'll see how it plays out !
---
Lame. Thanks!
---
Pidgeons you say? i had to deliver the mail myself! (ง'̀-'́)ง

---
I agree with the 20-30 people. You should have a decent idea by then.
---
I'll be making two (that I actually put time and effort into). Warlock will be my "main" - going to use him for farming, making bags for all my alts, and try to get him into raiding. Other will be a Druid. It's my absolute favorite class, but it's just going to be my "for fun" character - the one in which I won't care about getting the best gear, I'll pick talents I just find interesting, and generally do whatever I want.
---
I picked Warlock for the main because I enjoy them more than every other class (minus Druid), they're good at farming, and I should be able to get into raiding with him.
---
So if you find a class you enjoy, but you're worried about the endgame (and don't want to be pigeonholed into playing a spec you don't like), just use that for your "I'm having fun" character.
---
I actually really enjoyed totgc. I really enjoyed wotlk, though, too. I don't have such strong negativity with wotlk some have. I liked the cata difficulty, and I actually stopped playing after they changed that to the regular one-month-pop-ins.
---
I don't have enough room for another 32" without getting rid of the other stuff on my desk : (
---
Jewlcrafting and subsequently gems don't exist in vanilla. 
---
Now reading your post, it's not clear but maybe you're talking about using a profession's cooldown to craft a scarce resource. 
---
This does exist for Tailoring, Leatherworking, and I think  Alchemy?
---
I don't know why they don't just make another couple servers and invite more people. More data, more people finding bugs, surely spinning up another server isn't a big deal.
---
Having to watch streamers only play it for months leaves a bit of bad taste in everyone's mouth.
---
Maybe it's time to fire the guys that develop BFA if an old game from 2004 is doing better in the end. You know, what a reasonable company would do if their products start to suck.
---
I was referring to JC unaware it wasn't introduced until BC. Thanks for the reply
---
Someone pointed out it could be because of the variety of mounts that we came to use on flight paths, could be that, and gryphons lost their tilt and they never noticed, maybe
---
It’s funny...I have classes that I LOVE to level and hate at 60 due to PvE or PvP best spec/role...and then I have classes that I HATE leveling and really like at 60 for the same reasons on the other side of the coin.  I think the best thing to do is decide what you are going to spend your time on at 60 and level the class that best fits that regardless of the leveling experience. Instances and PvP are kind of the de facto way of getting a feeling for that.
---
Try skinning, and take over the devilsaur hide trade in AH.
---
Show up on time, make sure your gear is repaired, bring your own consumables, release and run back when you wipe instead of waiting for rez, don't beg for summon because you're too lazy to run to the raid. Those are the main things imo, the actual fights themselves are piss easy.
---
At level 1 even that adds up. It’s 5% of the damage of a fireball
---
Let's not act like you cannot make the same kind of arguments for classic. Doing that wouldn't sound right, but you could make a point that for example TBC pvp rewarded skill, whereas vanilla rewarded time investment. Afking 16hour a day in BGs would get you the top ranks.
---
I think if you are a top PvP player and you invested your time and effort into it, it's not so wrong that in that specific area of the game you perform better. PvP gear sucked in pve. Also, decreasing rng is not necessarily an objectively bad thing.
---
You could make the argument that if you are a fresh 60in vanilla, a player with full naxx gear can beat you by not even looking at the screen. Same as you slsl lock example.
---
I'm not saying resilience or TBC is great or better, but vanilla is not perfect either. 
---
You also talk about this like it's a fact - people enjoy different things, TBC vs vanilla is subjective.
---
But that fraction only makes up 1/2 the playerbase.
---
I hope they add the tilts and stuff to retail as well
---
I don't really agree with the idea that flying mounts have greater negative than positives. People still had world pvp over contested areas like mote farming (elemental plateau/skettis etc) so I don't agree with people saying flying mounts killed world pvp. Also most people in Classic strive to get their 100% mount first so they have easier time ganking and farming nodes. The same is applied to the 280% mount in BC. They both were big grind cash dumps that felt rewarding and paid out in the end. Not to mention that the 280% mount opened up Netherwing faction. I thought they handled flying mounts well in BC.
---
yes, the gem market will be utterly insane in classic. It will be so monopolized you will not even be able to see the gems in game for another 2 years after release!
---
Maybe i will. But consider this: my second monitor is my old monitor from like 2008 when i got my first desktop. 
---
I bought the main monitor like 4 years ago. :P
---
sure you can. whatever the gems needed for BIS twink goggles, arcane crystals to make arcanite bars
---
Hi, /u/GriffinAO
---
Baldurs Gate.
---
I leave the tutorial area for the first time. I see a wolf. I cast magic missile twice, out of spells, it's still alive. It kills me and I have to restart the fame and roll another character.
---
Greatest RPG of our time.
---
This trend of people calling retails players names is so weird to me. That's such middle school stuff coming from people who are presumably at least 25+
---
I didn't think you ran into wolves as an Undead for quite a while.  The only way I can see this being true is if they moved on to silverpine and didn't upgrade spells at the trainer.
---
I've been wondering about the F&amp;F thing not working. Glad/not glad I'm not alone.
---
Agreed.   I honestly would never have seen this coming.  Some people who play retail are legitimately threatened by Classic and feel the need to say nasty stuff.  It’s so bizarre.
---
They are going to have bugs today that won't be fixed until after release. The nature of video game development is that it's full of bugs many of which don't get fixed and are considered minor. I would not be surprised if the gryphons do not get fixed until six months after releae.
---
Wrath was my favorite expansion, but iirc it was also the first expansion that made a point of making sure all tanks had easy access to competent ape threat.  BC had paladins with a distinctive aoe threat advantage over bears and warriors.
---
Reading these comments are fucking comical, like, the top comment and subcomments read like a stereotype.

Hi, /u/ProfeNietzsche
---
No, you just have poor reading comprehension. Read the comments again.
---
Fuck me, Tulsa 2008.
---
We were all in it together man.
---
Don't worry, weird streamers like AdmiralBahroo somehow got access despite never playing WoW for 10 years. Blizzard will continue to deny this wasn't based on streamer privilege.
---
Noted!
---
PS I hear you hate Slayer
---
"Am I the only one..." NO!
---
You’re welcome. Glad that you enjoyed it!
---
Really depends on the class, imo. Like Warrior for example, you will probably get a good feel for it by lvl 20-30, but the whole grind to 60 is still pretty annoying. Once your 60 though and get decent gear the whole feel shifts, at least for me, and you truly become a wrecking ball.
---
Won’t be me because I’ll be a rogue.
---
Turn up ur brightness
---
Congrats, you're not brain dead
---
I’m surprised this is still available for sale!
---
Who’s Omar?
---
true, Blizzard is small indie company
---
It's also a little piece of history. I think WoW was the first MMO to have such a transportation system and they really wanted to make the flights impressive.

I was referring to larger pulls, where thunderclap inlr hits 4 targets, demo shout would hit them all, granted they're in range.
---
It will.  Those people always scream the loudest while 99% of the player base is in game not saying a word.  How do you think retail got to where it is today?  They listened to those people.
---
For someone referencing wasting time, you spend a lot of yours trash talking Classic on reddit.
---
What's twitch and what's a streamer never heard these terms before
---
Let me know if you wanna go to the other side, Theramore ;)
---
The question is the priority testing or free advertisement
---
granted most players are not testing most of the time
---
but if they were to spin up a new server possibly for just dungeon testing at higher levels or anything they decide to test it would be cool. 
---
i personally think the vast minority of important things can be tested at level 30 , our pretty vast reference is mostly at level 60
---
i dont expect level 60 content unless there is instant 60 servers , this i can sort of understand , but i honestly dont think you cant test most things at 30
---
I always preferred SW to IF
---
this is what my brother was like, said he played wow and didn't like it asked him  what level he got to and he said, about 20, tried to tell him he had hardly even played the game to get to that point but he wasn't interested, think he would like retail its a little less complicated xD

In general you'll have a pretty good idea by level 20 whether or not you enjoy the class. For classes like Druid just now getting cat form you might want to reserve judgement a while longer. Classes that tank or heal end-game might want to do a few dungeons in these roles to see if they can enjoy it.
---
If memory serves you should still eventually take that alt to 35 to use as a crafting alt instead of deleting it.
---
Make a new character.
---
Hunters eat warlocks while leveling
---
Shall have life eternal
---
You can get 100% uptime on that proc with big enough pulls but if you’re that geared your tank probably wouldn’t be wearing a shield in dungeon speed runs
---
Bruh he cast 3 fireballs, he should be like leve 50 by now wtf
---
The game isn’t even out yet? Lol wtf
---
In TBC my friends would login just to play peggle.
---
This dude's opinion is pretty much as low as a human can get. Very little understanding of things.
---
The Vanilla Var'jun:
---
-Keeps his hair tied up in the air for a natural intimidation boost.
---
-Rocks a dress and yet still finds a way to show off his muscles.
---
-Several millimeters of bone protrude from the chin.
---
-Eyes are looking in separate directions at all time.
---
-Is completely unintelligible over voice chat. Never needs to repeat what he has to say.
---
-Is always the life of the party.
---
The Classic Chad
---
-Facial features so bland it gives a new meaning to the term "vanilla".
---
-Refuses to play any class that doesn't wear pants.
---
-Has a set of gear *specifically* for wearing in the major cities in hopes that he gets noticed.
---
-Makes Sure Everyone Can Hear Him Clearly During The Raid. Repeats himself constantly.
---
-Leaves the party because he has a life.
---
This is World of Warcraft, the virgin's domain. Chad has no power here.
---
Except the people that built retail and converted the old game into what it is today are currently running the show for classic.
---
Gotcha. Prob gonna do a 0/31/20 thing then to maximize my warrior's smash time. Thanks for the info! Really appreciate it
---
Take them to 35 and pick a favorite. If you can't, 41 point talents could be the tie-breaker.
---
Been on this sub for 2 years, what you describe does not happen. You have a victim mentality and are attacking strawmen.
---
Do u work for NASA or something those computer parts dont exist, but I would recommend using the geforce 6800 ultra. It works great !
---
I always do ignore the one guy trying to start shit, but the problem is when that one guy is able to derail trade chat for 3+ hours, even while on your ignore list.
---
/join World and /join LookingForGroup might remain safe from them though
---
Most notable sources of negative feedback for Classic: r/wow, official forums, mmo champion, etc. Those are all social networks of retail users stuck with BfA.
---
Most notable sources of positive feedback for Classic: everyfuckingwhere.
---
If you see a druid heading to the coast of Silverpine or Westfall, they will definitely utilize it
---
How did you get the atlas early the game isn't released yet.. blizz employee??
---
Disappointing that these are the people who got into the stress test and I didn't.
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
"Blizzard does more damage than Frostbolt if there's 10 targets"
---
Well, yeah, no shit.
---
Demo shout is only "great threat" on 5+ mobs, which is very rare in dungeons. And even then, it's not "great" threat, it's just the best you have. Any AoE from DPS will pull off you instantly unless you've hit like 5 or 6 demo shouts.
---
There's definitely a difference between the vanilla and classic versions. I hope this is addressed as well!
---
Engineering and something else.
---
You can buy stuff but probably easiest to get mining to make it yourself
---
I cant stand the new models.
---
Right?  With that d4 hit die, you were dead to a bad dire rat bite. 🤪
---
With these classes (and warrior tanks) you can still get an idea by trying them out in dungeons.
---
I feel ya brother. I was fortunate to get to play some Thursday on the stress realm. Somehow it was still up. Got the vanilla feels. Can't wait for the next stress test and hopefully it won't be another two hours fighting the login monster.
---
If max our tour damage shields thorium spikes etc. And you are blocking with a tonne of mobs hitting you. Would you not be putting out significantly more dps and generating more threat than without a shield. Also do you know if the buff continues if you un-equip the shield or is it an equip only buff?
---
I'm talking specifically about the flight paths. I think there are much more important things to be taken care of
---
Using classic to boost retail's relevancy on twitch and vice versa is going to make blizzard money. It will always be the same category I suspect.
---
Stuff is just min maxed these days. 
---
Back then even if you’d played before you probably didn’t have enough money for a mount at 40, you didn’t know where quests were. Thottbot just had people sort of describing the area. You didn’t know respawn times or what was optimized. 
---
Shit is going to go so much faster for hardcore players this Time. 
---
Classic wow will be fun, but it won’t recapture the experience.
---
Seems like I am.
---
A level 1 mage is expected to be an amateur; a novice. His spells will be nothing but a slight warm brush against the seasoned wolf's pelt. With a few fiery balls the wolf will be slain, sure, but it'll take the mage time until he masters his magic and becomes a feared caster.
---
That *time* is the journey you take from level 1 to 60, arguably one of the biggest time sinks in any MMORPG out there. Once the mage reaches his ultimate destiny, i.e. becoming level 60 and mastering his abilities while also attaining amazing gear, he will be in the position to two, if not one shot most other enemies at his level.
---
This is what little Billy from the post is/was expecting, but he was not given that. He was not given that, because he does not deserve it. He can freely log into retail, make a level 1 mage, kit him out with full heirlooms and crit for 100+ and one shot every mob until he reaches max level.
---
But Classic/Vanilla is, and was never about that. It was about the journey to that ultimate destination of great power and responsibilities to your communities.
---
So little Billy should, unfortunately, stay away from this, because neither he will have a good time, nor the friends he might attempt to make along the way.
---
You got any good links on those farming spots for warlocks?
---
Show up on time, proper consumables (dont need to go as crazy as you can to minmax), and moving out of the fire/blizzard/etc.  Otherwise yep, just keep spamming frostbolt/fireball and you are good.
---
Beautiful looking book. That's the real wow to me, I said I would never give a sub to Blizz or anyone else but I just have to see the old school Azeroth one more time.
---
I mean he wants to get the net which a 225 engi is making it for him.. so I wouldn’t say he’s first!
---
His fault for leveling fire.
---
Totally agree! also seems like this person is really into BFA with a max level allied race toon.
---
Racials do make a difference but not enough that you won't be able to raid if you roll Orc warrior instead of Tauren.
---
Then alt tab. What they're talking about is that adding tilt will not only make the game closer to classic wow (which it's supposed to be anyway, so this shouldn't even be an argument) but it will make the game more immersive for people who DO enjoy seeing the sights.
---
&gt; Did you forget that nobody liked BFA and it’s regarded as one of the worst expansions blizzard released?
---
According to who? Clamorous idiots such as yourself? "Everyone" thought Legion was dogshit on launch as well, but it was clearly an enormously successful expansion that's remembered fondly.
---
With Deadly Boss Mods (And Vanilla raids, especially early, not having complex strategies) if you are on time, bring consumables, and know how to press 3-4 buttons, you're going to be a quality raider.
---
Seriously, Heroic Kil'Jaeden in Legion is 100x harder than anything Vanilla has to offer. Be confident. Doesn't hurt to research fights before hand I guess, but DBM will guide you.
---
So what about the 3rd wolf
---
Be aware though if you assign it to put soulshards in a specific bag and delete at a certain amount (say 5), if u have a item in the 5th slot that is greyed out (happens sometimes due to some weird bug, u cant move the item or anything it just sits there greyed out) it will delete that item in the slot, happened to me and deleted my green chest I had :(
---
true i missed that
---
It really is easy to get into. It's straight forward. Not much to think about. Skill tree is simple. It's easy to play and level. The experience and friends you make will last forever.
---
I think the classic viewership is a product of the limited beta access. I think it will decrease once all the people watching are able to play
---
Good find, seems like everyday some new bug (or not bug) is discovered on the beta!
---
always appropriate. Theres barely plate/mail/leather with the correct stts. And the 5% bonus does not exist until wrath
---
Deal with it.
---
Resilience is worse than you may remember. Its an extremely overpowered stat combined with HP, even worse when combined with HP and SL/SL.
---
Lets make worst case scenario cases:
---
Classic
---
Your fresh 60 around 3k hp (depending on how much you did some brd and stuff while lvling).
---
Full t3 BiS dude chills at around 5,5k hp.
---
1,5k hp difference whereas a good shatter does more than that in dmg, even with starter gear. 
---
One good outplay, CD advantage or gadget advantage like engineering and you can actually win. Its difficult and not "fair" dont get me wrong. But chances are that you can win.
---
Now worst case for BC:
---
Full S4 BiS Dude with 14k+ hp.
---
New 70 with 7-8k hp.
---
7-6k Hp difference.
---
A well put shatter in BC deals around 3k dmg without gear, if double crit.
---
450 resilience makes sure that you don't crit, and even if you crit, you will deal around 1,5 - 2k dmg with it as crit dmg is reduced.
---
Your chances go down to almost 0% right there. Autohitting would most likely be enough to win, the lowgear 70 would go oom or die to white hits before he could kill the fullgear s4 70.
---
The difference is that base dmg in classic is way higher, and that there is no resilience + lower health pools and differences even between fresh 60 and BiS 60 when compared to BC. 
---
This means that in Classic skill matters more than in BC. Because gear matters less in Classic (overall).
---
Of course there are certain corner cases where this doesnt apply and not everything is roses in Classic – but from a PvP standpoint only, Classic is the far better version objectively.
---
I say that as someone who played Classic PvP a lot and was high rated in BC and Wrath. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I loved being overgeared in BC stomping everyone. But thats something that makes the overall experience for the majority of players worse and I am accepting this sad truth even tho i profited from the system.
---
This is so true, I admit I value the hours I play more then when I was able to play 8-10 hours a day. It felt normal, now it feels special.
---
You’ll want a 14 inch crt with a flicker around the edge for playing classic....
---
I know this is a dagger guide, but leveling Sub is my fav strat as rogue.  And you mentioned Hemo but you didn't mention a weapon swap.  
---
Having a weapon swap for a Sword or Mace makes it imo one of the most efficient leveling specs.  You ambush, then swap for Ghostly / hemo.  Then Evisc.  
---
IMO it's competitive with combat for leveling because you have so much frontloaded damage, particularly if you get opportunity (2 hits to evisc).
---
As someone who was mid-level raiding when Vanilla was live (i.e. we managed to get a few weeks of C'thun tries in before BC hit, but never downed him, we beat the four horsemen, but never Kel), I would say being a good raider in general is a lot about perseverance and dependability. You show up with pre-summoned food and water, your own buff food, with pots and elixirs, you are on time and fully repaired, and if you get a new piece of equipment, you get it properly enchanted in a timely manner. You take wipes in stride, and you don't go into special snowflake meltdown mode ("My repair costs!" - *Everyone* has them, not just you; If you cannot afford them, do not raid.) even after the tenth wipe at the same boss: Instead, you concentrate, and play the encounter as well as you can from the top.
---
That all said, even if you see a lot of Frobo, Frobo, Frobo for mages in MC (or Decurse, Decurse, Decurse), there a lot more going on in most encounters. Threat is a real concern, and unless you're just an alt being dragged along for a for spare epics, it will be a concern for you in a lot of encounters. Managing your mana is practically its own mini-game for healers, as is threat management for everyone else (and healers, though mostly in group pve). Vaelastrasz was the Guild Breaker because "Frobo, Frobo, Frobo" ceased to be a winning move with him: Pulling threat off a tank for even a split second often enough was a wipe.
---
And in the end, you will be amazed by how many people can ignore the simplest raid command (bunch up so the mob doesn't Rush) *repeatedly*, and will only even react when their name is called out specifically ("For the tenth time, Legolazzor, if we say "Bunch up", you FUCKING BUNCH UP NAO! Not when you're dead on the ground and wail for a battle rezz! This isn't fucking Gnomish engineering, you should know how to run forward! Jesus, if [rivaling guild] could see us fail here, they'd be pissing their pants from laughter!")
---
It is. The gryphon mindlessly turns (yaw) left and right, as if on a rail. The old gryphon banks (roll) with the turns in the flight path. It’s just the animation of the gryphon, not the flightpath itself I think.
---
Yeah. Warlocks are fun and can be very good in pvp with their fears and dots. But I think mages are just straight up better they have insane cc with their frost tree and can do a ton of damage up front. The only thing that puts me off about mages compared to locks is how many people tend to play mages, they are everywhere
---
yeah but karma.  gotta post a flip phone picture of your shitty monitor and reap the internet points.
---
To be honest I never tried to downrank. Probably not worth it, and as a warlock your shards are already a finite resource in a raid. Especially as people will ask for "refills" after a while.
---
Not going to lie; I will miss not having a soulwell.
---
All good mate, best of travels August 27th!
---
I had this same thought when someone pointed out someone's 4/17/0 demonology build. Man I'm bummed by it
---
I played Legion on a 2011 MacBook Pro with no issues
---
People want to have FUN in their video games. Dark Souls is hard but it's FUN. WoW leveling today and back then is neither hard nor fun. It's a game of pull the mob then run back 10 yards every time to do the same front loaded combat rotation and spend the rest of your time regenerated mana by doing nothing.
---
flying over the ruins of andorhal as a lvl 22 and seeing Araj the Summoner felt epic back in the days. that lich with a skull level
---
I know they have been talking to streamers asking their opinion on splitting the channel. So yes it is being considered.
---
And Twitch can make them seperate on about 5 minutes. It is literally just adding a game to the DB. I'm sure the closer we get to launch the more we will know about the twitch aspect of it.
---
Do you know for sure when you were added to the list?
---
It seems your best bet is to just check a little after 6 PM PST, that is when the invites seem to go out. But I have no idea if they do F&amp;F stuff on the weekend, and with it being a three day weekend..
---
Was hoping I could get some Classic WoW in on Memorial Day weekend.
---
Every item is a hunter item.
---
You can monopolize any low volume high demand market space, just need a cut throat attitude and willingness to make a few enemies. I would share how to do it, but id get downvoted to oblivion
---
Attendance and farming consumables, resist gear.
---
I started in spring 2005 but didn't make my own account until a few months later lol. I have no vanilla achievements/feats and the highest PvP rank I ever reached was senior sergeant (on a toon subsequently deleted and rerolled). Nothing to show for it, little to show for TBC as well. I didn't raid until Wrath and even that was super casual and mostly pugs. I have never been a hardcore player. I don't expect that to change now.
---
Why would you tab out? Do you not have phones?
---
No it didn't. It was about 3 months until thru added the OSRS category on twitch.tv. Just no one labelled their stream with the correct game. Everyone kept clicking runescape.
---
It's not as simple as that.
---
The beta right now is a unique perspective on WoW. It's WoW with a level cap of 30. It has its own meta, its own epic experiences, something that has never before and will never again be possible. It's popular for the very same reason that spin-off shows get made: fans of something want to try a different but related aspect of it.
---
The testing aspect is whatever, it's something that happens automatically and there's no reason to expect that everyone must approach a beta like some kind of scientist nurturing his life's work. People aren't grumpy because they don't get to send in bug reports, they're grumpy because they're missing out on what looks to be an exciting and memorable version of the game that they'll never have the chance to play.

In a 5-man it's not an issue, since you'll almost never have two healers (so whoever the healer is can take the cloth), and if you get cloth DPS gear, clearly it should go to the clothie DPS who rolls higher (if there are two in the group, anyway).
---
In a raid, a proper Loot Council will save armor tier gear for its "most appropriate" wearers unless there's a serious dearth of higher armor gear (like, a Fury Warrior will likely get some mail or leather because there isn't too much Plate DPS gear, especially not in early raids). If you're using SK, priority is meaningless. If you're using DKP, then fine, outbid a clothie for gear they needed, and then pass up any opportunity to get the appropriate higher armor gear for that slot for a very, very long time.
---
It's an issue that resolves itself. I wouldn't put too much stock in worrying about how to "solve" it.

As someone who spend most of their twenties on drugs, you missed out.

&lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt;
---
North American Alliance
---
West Coast / PvE Realm
---
About us: &lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt; is going to be a casual PvE guild, we're recruiting players just to have an awesome time with WoW Classic and casually progress through content.
---
There will not be any sourt of pressure to reach max level, we all have lives that come first and will be the priority. The raids we do will likely be half pugged. The only thing in
---
this guild that won't be tolerated is destructive drama. We're coming to this game to have a great time and try to pursue loot without destroying our lives. That being said, this will
---
be a mature guild, under 18s are allowed but must understand that we won't censor ourselves around them (Though harrassment isn't acceptable).
---
PvP focused players are welcome to gather here, though the leadership isn't planning on focusing on PvP much more than the occasional BG.
---
There is not currently a set raid schedule but end of week (Wed-Fri) is the most likely direction we will take this in with maybe a pickup on Sunday or Monday.
---
If you'd like to find out more feel free to DM me. There isn't any formal application process but I would like to just speak to you before I hand out invites to the Discord server.
---
Just go afk and smoke a bowl or something
---
If you actually want to play the game in the first week, dynamic respawns don’t do shit, if I use vacation days just to sit in a que of 10k+ ppl all week I’m not going to be happy, tel me how dynamic respawn is better in that regard
---
Spell combinations. Having to actually aim your spells. Dodging attacks. There are loads of ways to make the combat much more engaging.
---
Always had a tux on my bank alt. I'm sure I had a har of some sort too. The pump cane is a nice touch.
---
No JC in classic.
---
That is just how the texture is, maybe the uv map shifted?... I dunno.  I will look at it at polish stage, now this is just basic hard work importing and redoing stuff.

“What do mean? Now we can finally play the game.” - Eric Cartman
---
Yeah maybe if you like being carried without a challenge, go ahead and level slow so all your future guildmates have gear and they can take you through Molten Core in 2 hours. It's quite an accomplishment getting carried, oh yeah.
---
This doesn't bother me in the least, not really a priority.

Do you not read the comments before posting? Genuinely curious.

I'm well aware how to do it, but thanks :D
---
The difference between a hunter that executes his shot rotation properly and some nub who spams arcane shot is huge. Like 300dps difference.
---
Can't wait for my panda in Classic. Will be relatively rare to have vanilla CE from launch.
---
Thanks for the reply. I didn’t mean to imply that I thought naxx 40 wasn’t hard. I know it was harder than naxx 25. I just find the claim that the damage numbers in vanilla naxx were the same as wotlk naxx dubious.
---
I did not remodel the orcs, they are "enhanced" by me tho :)
---
It's like Final Fantasy. Doesn't get good until 100 hours in.
---
Unfortunatly too much of outland was built with flying in mind.
---
I did like dueling on the floating rocks in nagrand tho
---
As long as ur working you don't have to explain yourself to anyone with what u spend your time doing as far as I'm concerned
---
Yeah. 
---
Are you gonna keep dismissing every single criticism? People are trying to make the game better before release, not in a hateful way. Someone posts direct proof, and all you can is “ohh really? That bothers youuu?”
---
Why are you even on this sub? Stop the negativity.
---
He's not a speedrunner tho. He's playing as fast as he can, but his routing is pretty bad, and others, who have gotten in later, crush his time.
---
Nah bruh, gettin' [SWOLE](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ihwsx/the_classic_wow_exercise_program/)
---
I support this thread.
---
It's a retail feature. They're building the game on top of the retail client with classic data. There are going to be a lot of issues like this. The whole reason for the beta, aside from marketing, is to find issues that arise from porting old data onto the new client. Like this one. And they've been pretty good at it so far. So I'd relax your tone.
---
Hydra just got beta access and has been streaming :)
---
The only reason to go Axesmith now is if you want to make Nightfall for your guild.
---
I live in a smaller ish town so when a game sells out on every online store I can walk in to GameStop and they have multiple copies.
---
Alchemy is profitable.  
---
Enchanting can be.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous. It's like they don't want to invite anyone in case it spoils the ecelebs experience. Really disappointing, but it's to be expected from such a bad company.
---
That’s what I’m talking about! Cheers mate.
---
Raided semi-seriously as a priest/rogue, which meant I saw everything including AQ and Naxx, though we never managed to beat either C'thun or Kel. I still have a slight trauma from being stuck at the TwinEmps for two months or so, and them remaining wobbly for a month after that.
---
God, I remember using this and the priest, mage and paladin versions for ages. They were so useful. Glad to see it's back.
---
Lol, casual.
---
Game isnt about immersion exploration.
---
Its about trolling around killing alliance while getting prepped for raids.
---
Indeed, its never enough for these people, always more, more and more. I cant understand how people live with themselves.
---
I enjoyed Kala today. He has quite some nice stuff going on + some explanation videos in Youtube
---
Oh yeah, the specific claim that they're "the same for most fights" is a massive overstatement lol. I just wanted to make sure because I've seen a lot of people think that MC and Naxx are roughly the same time-investment and I don't want anyone's dreams crushed when they see the consumables they have to farm in preparation in patch 1.10 lol.
---
thanks for the detailed reply. Looks like it's a blast to level, pvp, and 5-man dungeons, but consensus seems to be limited raid variations.
---
What do you mean ? I just said you are right.
---
I kinda felt similar on Feral. I mained Feral for a long time, although I didn't play it when I played classic. It seemed fine tbh in 1v1s, even strong actually. But like you said, if any extra person came it actually felt impossible. I think this is mainly because they capitalize on your form swaps.
---
I don't think so tbh. There are people out there who's job it is to talk about WoW (big Youtubers for example), and we have a whole different level of internet and information access. there's no chance to get the same kind of "mystery" again - even if it was a new game / developed new lvl60 content
---
99% of us will be windowed out watching hardcore porn or day trading anyways.
---
Easy to play, easy to get hooked. At worst, you get bored with the grind and cancel your sub.
---
Nice, I’ll check them out!
---
I second Kala. Great content creator. Plus he’s got a lower stream count so he answers all your questions you have
---
To each his own but vanilla wow was the most fun I have ever had in my life in any kind of game ever, MMORPG's for sure!
---
YMMV 🤷‍♂️
---
Depends on the server, if there are more horde than alliance then queue times will be faster for alli and vice versa
---
How would this be diffrent with layering? This thread isnt about queues
---
There is a very strong inverse correlation between a persons credibility and their post count on the official blizzard forums
---
You're the third person to mention weapon-swapping. The only reason I didn't include that trick is because I've never personally tried it, and I wasn't sure if it was worth it. I'll add a little note at the end about it, thanks for the tip.
---
Nah, come join the alliance
---
An arbitrary and dumb label. WoW was very much an "action-RPG" compared to the MMO games before it.
---
Get out
---
Why sad? It's funny lol.
---
People who don't like this kind of gameplay probably won't play. That isn't bad, sad, or wrong. Different strokes for different folks.
---
This is win/win for everyone. Those who enjoy BFA have BFA. Those of us who prefer Classic have Classic. I don't think there's a lot of overlap and that's fine. Not liking Classic doesn't make somebody a bad person, and shitting on Classic doesn't make them any worse than us for shitting on BFA. This isn't a big deal.
---
You had me till stacks of warcraft.
---
It makes no sense as an addition
---
BG's have been confirmed for crossrealm btw. So it's a matter of if it's region wide or battlegroups make a comeback
---
You're lucky. Those of us who did play it, are like drug addicts.
---
Me and two friends are gonna level together at launch holy trinity style. I can’t decide if I should be a lock or mage for the dps role. 
---
Lock        - soul stone will be a huge time saver in case of wipes (we tend to overestimate our abilities)
---
                  - since the three of us will be together most of the time we could summon other party members when needed
---
                  - free mount!
---
                  - Imp stamina buff
---
                  
---
Mage.      - better burst damage 
---
                  - free water and food
---
                   - portals and teleport
---
                   - intellect buff
---
I’ve played both and enjoyed each, end game content does not factor into the decision for me as I don’t really care for raiding. I’m leaning towards lock because I feel like there will always be an available mage. 
---
So which caster will better complete the triad?
---
I actually forgot about this, I had not even realized that it had been taken away/changed. I am a vanilla veteran and I actually do remember it after being this way, having been reminded of this. I think they should definitely find a way to bring it back.
---
you activate advanced logging in the game
---
and /combatlog to start recording
---
another /combatlog will stop recording
---
the file is in your game folder _classic_beta_/logs/WoWCombatLog.txt

I played a warlock through classic.  Warlocks are amazing in 1v1 combat vs all classes but Shaman. In group pvp you tend to get swarmed by melee and can’t escape.  PVE you can never really shine due to Threat issues.  Warlock can be a lot of fun but tends to be frustrating.
---
I played a hunter through vanilla and I gotta say combat was fun af. That rotation you have to work out to best utilize your mana for the mobs. The actual threat of death. I mean I mostly played it for the stories and the atmosphere but I never actually got sick of killing things until WOTLK, when I was farming ice-giant kills to buy a mammoth or something. I was like, wow, this is so boring. Stopped playing after that.
---
Been subbed pretty much since BC with no invite and Fortnite noobs who’ve never played getting in
---
I spoke to a GM (from Europe) and he said they are not told *when* more invites will happen and *which* accounts get flagged.
---
Personally I believe we'll get a lot more invites in the upcoming weeks and the level cap raised. Lots more things need testing, not to mention mounts, honor rewards, AB/AV, some more dungeons etc.
---
They are just doing the beta in stages, while tactically using streamers to generate ridiculous hype. Note, I am not saying this in a bad way at all, but it's very clear. I've probably spent /played 4 days or so just from watching streamers play it.
---
I’d say the idea of toxicity in of itself is to blame. Youngsters aren’t anymore toxic than we once were, if anything original Xbox live chat can attest to that. The issue is that so many people who didn’t grow in that environ are just now getting exposed to it. Most not realizing that venting frustrations be it in text, or verbally in a hyperbolic or offensive manner has been the lifeblood of online social communities since inception. Blaming the kids is an easy cop out, and is really just admitting you either “grew out” of this behavior or are just ignorant of it.
---
Instead of complaining about “toxicity” and trying to “fix” it, I suggest you just deal with it. we gained friendships and met cool people in the past despite it arguably being worse back then, what harm could it do now?
---
Honestly, you're doing it wrong. I say this in the nicest way possible. For feral you want a 14-32-5 if you're looking to focus on damage and shapeshifter effective. Otherwise 1-29-21 hotw keeps NS and you still get a good sized mana pool, though your damage suffers.
---
I'm willing to bet that how root were approaching the fights could also be improved. Vanilla did required fluidity and adaptability. Even then, winning over 50% of duels is nothing to complain about. Every class has counters, and for a did those are warlock, shaman, and paladins. Protests can be tough too, but you gotta know to to reset fights to win those.
---
Should probably fire the guys who made checkers, if chess a game from 3000 years ago is doing better in the end.
---
Retail is still profitable, or there would be personnel changes

Warlocks get destroyed by ganking  rogues and and warriors when you have anything except voidwalker out.

99% of people will never reach a level of gear where SL is worth it, and fun.
---
I don't mean to be a dick I promise!

I literally only want the search bar end stop.
---
Like, zero stuff on the page except a search bar.  I alt/tab a lot playing classic and I need instant pertinent information.
---
Whatever website that accomplishes this will be the site I use.  It looks doubtful it will be wowhead.   Ya'll kind of have a reputation of slow load  times and tons of ads and shit I don't need to see/read.
---
Search bar only !
---
All you really need are proper tags to filter out what you're looking for.
---
Well this breaks my heart
---
it's shit, still, google helps
---
Yeah you are right I didn't think about x-realm bg's.
---
That's what she said
---
They seem to have a different take on it from one person to another. Here's hoping though.
---
It will probably happen sometime in the future, just like it did with OSRS.
---
Basically this. It looks pretty bad you've spent millions on a game and people only care about the 15 year old version.
---
Again, it's not the actual game. Unless you have the knowledge and classic experience to effectively bug test classic, I can't comprehend why anyone cares about playing.
---
They're going with cheap training and expensive mounts
---
This is the WoW 2 perspective.
---
No thanks.  I want Vanilla WoW to be available *forever*.  I want the ability to re-sub, play for a while, and then quit.  I want the option to come back and play Vanilla WoW *whenever I like*.
---
The idea that, if they decide to, Blizzard can just "distill Vanilla WoW to its essence and continue development in that direction" is so short-sighted.  If that was easy to do, then why has no one done it?  As soon as they start adding stuff, it will no longer be Vanilla, and I'll start to miss Vanilla.  And so will you.
---
Will Classic die if they don't add content?  I doubt it.  There will always be a market for classic WoW just like there will always be a market for Smash Bros. Melee and Brood War.  It may not be a huge market, but it will be consistently there.
---
I watch this once a year to relive my nostalgia
---
I remember in wrath, when dungeon finder came out, it was used to supplement parties that you had already assembled with your buds. Like “we need a healer to start, open up dungeon finder”. Eventually it replaced that entirely and people only used dungeon finder exclusively.
---
love the staff tho. too bad if you had the aff ring it was basically a freebie
---
Mage is absolutely stronger.
---
Even in nax, if a warlock goes up against a nax headed war/rogue without having void up its over.
---
And even with void up, if they’re not SL they can still lose easily
---
the fun in classic comes from the need to group up with people. sure you can do it alone if you only have an hour to play but if you sit down for a longer time to level you can group up with some random people you just meet in the world and level together and since the leveling is slow you have time to talk to them.
---
in current WoW sure the leveling is faster and easier but that means there is no need to group up with random people in the zone. the best experiance leveling in Wod, legion and BfA i have had was in hillsbrad foothills killing the group quest yeti since that is pretty much the only group quest mob you can not solo but after that we all left as there was not point to continue.
---
classics fun is a side effect of the slow and hard mobs forcing people together. there is no equal in BfA.
---
It goes both ways. I have definitely seen people take random shots at both versions of the game, but it's much more apparent in this sub to be honest. A lot of players in this sub constantly feel like the only way to praise classic is to shit on live instead of focusing on the obvious merits.
---
&gt;BfA has been one of the most watched games on Twitch
---
Not really. Until Classic beta, WoW had not been anywhere near the most watched Twitch games since like 2018 fall.
---
Get your BFA memes outta here

Yes i I'm,  will add if I find something that meets the requirements.

fuck these mods on this reddit. Ive seen this post so many times and they remove my posts so quick. fuck you reddit mods
---
layering prevents queues by putting people into layers, aka layering
---
i feel like that’s a class that really opens up at lvl 60 but idk
---
I was gonna ask: was Ulduar WOTLK or BC? Because I thoroughly enjoyed that one.
---
You have to do some serious mental gymnastics to claim that double specialization is just a QOL change.
---
I suspect you're right about it being linked to 6.1 - "As of Patch 6.1, you can now fly to a destination point without knowing all the points in between. You still can't fly to ones you don't know, but this new feature prevents many of the inefficient routes that happened previously and also allows flying to destinations that were previously inaccessible." - Sounds like quite a substantial re-write of the flight paths system occurred in 6.1.
---
If Im in layer1, the oly reasons I would want to go to layer2 is when my friends are there. Well thats allready sorted out. 
---
Its not intended to run from a ganker or switchs layers when you are done farming layer1 and want to farm in layer2.
---
&gt; unless it's something like Fear Ward for Dwarven Priests it's not that big of a deal.
---
And even then, it should not force you into playing a race you do not like. Fear Ward is a nice and easy way of taking pressure off of your tanks in some encounters, but firstly, not every priest in any raid needs to be a dorf (so there's space for humans and night elves), and secondly, warriors should be able to compensate with their own fear immunity if no wards are available. 
---
Fear Ward *is* nice to have, but if you cannot stomach playing a hairy beerball, go human (or even Nelf, if you must). They're still solid choices, and first and foremost, you play to have a good time, and that means you should pick a race that you enjoy playing.
---
&gt; Deleting a level 30 char you've spent a few days/a week leveling isn't really that big of a deal.
---
Especially considering it's beta and will be wiped anyway
---
Man I agree with this so much. Old school runescape does this they have even added stuff from the current version of runescape but kept it in the spirit of old school
---
I've got better things to do then check three cities on two continents when I want to buy potions.
---
That's good news, I did not know xrealm was in.
---
This is absolutely a fun game. Loot amd context. Its meant to be immersive. The devs want you to spend all your time in the world they created...which is amazing.
---
This is what happens when marketing people get promoted to all the top jobs. ' You think you want it, but you don't' proves they have absolutely no idea what they're doing.
---
Their game will be popping off though. They're new iteration of it and all the expansions to follow will be the new WoW, the more popular WoW. Give retail the death it deserves, the death it has earned.
---

Yes Hue Sync is nice, but not 100% what I am looking for.

Huh? When asmongold isn’t around it struggles to stay in top 15-20 games the Sunday night before classic beta it had 8k viewers.
---
Thanks for this post man its fun being reminded how much has changed ;)  
---
Now that you know JC isn't an option, you gonna try to corner the market on a different profession instead? Raid consumables were a lot more relevant in Vanilla. Herbing might be your thing?
---
Jump on some private servers. It will take u way too long to find a class u like by just leveling them. This is why most people in actual Vanilla played classes they barely enjoyed, but didn't have the will to level up another.
---
So you don’t know what layering does, makes sense
---
Game.create(name: ‘World of Warcraft: Classic’)
---
- Show up on time
---
- Show up with consumables
---
- Know tactics before joining
---
- Know wich gear to "Need" or bid/buyout with DKP
---
- Communicate when needed
---
- Never ninjapull extra packs
---
- Never ninjapull a boss
---
Oh man this brings back memories of solo’ing Spazz for my Barman Shanker.   I remember killing him right in the bar actually.  Can he still be solo’d?
---
There’s a bunch of people with 225 engineering including streamers.
---
Llane was the name I think. North America
---
That's the date that the achievement system was added genius. Not the date when he got the ranks.
---
For some reason going back I find hunters extremely boring now. I even played one in Vanilla.
---
Hey man just wanted you to know that JC isn’t in classic
---
It's worth noting that 2PM PDT is a much friendlier time for EU players.  I can quite comfortably join the login testing before going to bed at a reasonable hour.
---
You roll for an item that's an upgrade.
---
Reading that makes me want to play Classic even more!
---
BINGO. This is exactly why they haven't done it yet, they don't want to face how quickly people are going to ditch BFA to watch Classic. (It's already happened.. you can check the view difference  yourself haha).
---
This gave me a chuckle, and I've never really thought about it this way. The logic checks out!
---
All good things have.
---
Calling /u/Kaivax
---
But they didn't lie about it, they ARE the correct size.
---
We can apply logic to Blizzard's decision making, yours on the other hand is quite lacking.
---
Is it bad that I think they deserve that?
---
Soul link makes you a God vs casters and decent vs melee.  The issue is it is a very slow and boring play style.  More of a battle of attrition style.  You just have so much HP and slowly kill your target.
---
&gt;Shit sorry to hear man;

I did fix up the bag ordering in  [https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/archive/v0.2.zip](https://github.com/robert388/Necrosis-classic/archive/v0.2.zip)   
---
&gt;Can you check if you can reproduce  it with this version( and not a green chest xD)
---
&gt; No one will watch cash grab of azeroth.
---
You are aware that Classic is a cash grab in itself, just put a bit more effort into it?
---
YUP.
---
Because the first screenshot was from a private server.
---
Not for long.
---
IF was still the hub throughout classic. Not only was it grandfathered in due to the only alliance an form over a year, but it was also closer or equally close to all content except zg. 
---
With 1.9 we have aq....which was easier to get to from IF than SW. the next patch was naxx, which is still easier to get to from IF.
---

I hate all of you. Spamming some ‚funny‘ meme. Hehehe LOL you Know that meme aswell? xDddddddd
---
The point is you're wrong.
---
Cataclysm and MoP get way too much hate. MoP has questionable subject matter and the story was weak but mechanically and gameplay wise not at all. Cata heroics early one were a good difficulty level, the change to the leveling system was refreshing though as time went on it was annoying as Cataclysm was over and the destruction of old zones didn't always justify the streamlined leveling experience.
---
Honor =/= standing. You can get standing 1 with 10,000 honor and get the maximum RP of 13,000 as long as nobody else grinds no more than 10,000 honor. Also, if 2 people get exactly the same amount of honor they both get awarded the higher standing of their tie. Enter: bracket stacking, where multiple people get exactly the same amount of honor so multiple people from the same premade can get standing 1.
---
They only have a few used copies. I bought it for $40 CND.
---
Yeah I have the same feeling but I'm not holding my breathe. I'll gladly try to randomly connect during the early window and then probably play during the day on Thursday. If it means that it isn't a total disaster at launch, I'll be glad I could do my part and suffer when its just in beta phase.
---
Defcamp and melderon tv
---
&gt; How hard can it be for Twitch to implement? 
---
Not hard at all. People are making way too many dumb lazy excuses for Blizzard and Twitch, it's weird dude. I'd imagine that Twitch staff has to do the daunting task of clicking Create New Category, Type Classic WoW, Publish. Is it really much harder than that? Lol.
---
Go kill a starting area mob on retail. lmao.
---
I was trying 14-32-5 and it´s not that great to be honest. HotW (1-29-21) is much better because lacking the NS is a huge deal in PvP. 
---
I was using roots to the highest potential. It was the only way for me to reset a fight against Warrs and Rogues.  I was hibernating Hunter´s pet, dispelling all curses, using Abolish poison to prevent Blind. Pre-Hoting, root &amp; run to drink up, engineering, trinkets and so on.
---
That said, 5e level 1s are actually weaker than 4th edition...
---
Less healing output during an encounter than other healers
---
Do you honestly think the same will happen to BFA? 
---
Note that nobody remembers WoD fondly either and that was also labelled as the worst expansion of all time.
---
This person def didn’t play vanilla lmao just flexin
---
Spirit actually gives you better regen when you're proccing Improved Drain Soul talent. It's still a good stat for levelling as it will considerably lower your downtime between pulls.
---
For my raiding spec, Human gets a free 7% DPS boost, all else equal.
---
I'll take it.
---
 Makes you wonder his definition of good
---
I bring up the need for a cooldown because of the way gather nodes and farming work in WoW. In another post about layering [I mentioned SWTOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bske9l/if_layering_is_a_group_of_mini_servers_that_will/eonw6vi/) as an example of where unrestricted layer hopping is arguably okay (particularly since it has been in the game since launch and isn't a new economic or mechanics change) and why that doesn't work for WoW.
---
It's all well and good joining your friends/group, but we have to also account for the very real possibility of exploiting it to farm extra gather mats or camp rare spawns across multiple layers. The simplest way to resolve this is a cooldown. Some people have proposed a cross-layer tagging system so if you loot a black lotus on layer 1 you can't hop to layer 2 to loot that same lotus until it respawns.
---
But something needs to happen.
---
Yes sir I'll figure something out! For the moment I've decided on Dwarf Priest, my professions will be tailoring/engineering, so I'll definitely have a mining alt at least. I missed out on the original Vanilla experience so I'll have to do a bit more research but I'm sure I'll find my niche market :)
---
Something to add, a good portion of vanilla raids are “sudden death” kind of raids, it’s not difficult until somebody screws up, then things violently implode.
---
I was testing it at 60 on psers (even with R14 gear + T3)
---
iT'S NoT ThAt EaSy!
---
Really, wtf is the holdup? I'd bet money that Blizzard doesn't want people to see just how well Classic is doing compared to BFA.
---
It's entirely % of population based. Only the top 0.3% of honor farmers each week will get a standing yielding over 12k RP, the amount required to overcome honor decay at rank 14. On a small server, that's only 1 person. On a larger server, it could be 2-3. 
---
That's also assuming that people aren't doing funny things with bracket stacking to all share standing 1 each week by getting the exact same amount of honor.
---
I thought I was the only one doing this...
---
lol I appreciate that, just wanted to let you know that about 15 people beat you to the punch
---
Yeah, it is. It's out on beta.
---
Here's a guy playing it live right now: https://www.twitch.tv/kinggothalion
---
When did esfand say that?
---
Honestly, you aren't missing out on anything. Beta is boring to be perfectly honest, right now I'm just giving access to my account to close friends because I have 0 interesting in playing when all that time/effort (albeit the little amount required) gets eventually deleted. I got to level 8 on a gnome mage and haven't logged in since as I only wanted to test 1 thing.
---
the artifacts on the image ruin it, or it would be so nice
---
You zoomers understand nothing about good game design. No one feels like they're having fun if they get everything handed to them without any effort. There is no moment in the dumbed down non-MMORPG that is BfA where you will feel like you're having a lot of fun, nor will you ever feel like you are playing an MMO (because it isn't one) or an RPG (it isn't one).
---
&gt; Early access is different, it's not a beta. It's the developers saying "Hey, guys, so...Here's this unfinished game
---
&gt;It wasn't obvious that that was my opinion? Really?
---
How is that different than all the people here talking shit about retail? It's one of the most common things here.
---
Btw, I don't play retail (haven't played other expansions since vanilla) so I don't have any opinion either way.
---
I agree that when it comes to the gameplay itself, leveling in vanilla was just as dull if not more than in retail right now. However makes it fun (for me at least) is that the itemization in vanilla is a MUCH bigger aspect. In retail is feels like i deal the same amount of damage from lvl 20 to lvl 100 or something. A weapon upgrade as a warrior/rogue/hunter is immediately noticeable, and the hunt for the next upgrade is much more enaging. 
---
Also the talent tree. I just really like getting that point every level. I know that there is pretty much no choice in the trees in the endgame and everyone runs the same cookiecutter tree, but during leveling is gives me a nice sense of progression. It's probably also why legion was the only xpac where I enjoyed leveling again.
---
Is it against the rules here to ask for private servers that have pretty accurate vanilla wow options? I really wanna play and get myself familiar with it again before it comes out.
---
Winterspring is a VERY easy farm. You can enslave the demons there and use them for farming (they also are banish and fear-able). Mara is a little harder. Videos for them are pretty sparse. DM East, you follow the same path that mages do. You can't do it until 60 with some decent gear. You use your Voidwalker's AoE taunt after a tick of Rain of Fire to have the plants snap aggro to him. Usually it takes two Rain of Fires to kill all the lashers. then you should have \~45 seconds of downtime between pulls to wait for torment (VW AoE taunt) to come off cool down.

Rocket boots and parachute cloak. So much fun. Later on when they added a rocket launcher for gauntlets my retadin was so much fun in Alterac Valley.
---
Can you F&amp;F help me with a reference? 8) Wish I had an inside connection!
---
No, but now I think I have to.
---
There are actually 3 separate things here.
---
1. (early vanilla) you can only fly to the next node, where you land and need to talk to the flight master again.
---
2. (late vanilla I think) you still pass by all the nodes, in already a straighter line (f.e. The zigzagging towards crossroads) but you now don't land at the nodes instead you fly down near the flightpath and then immediately continu right before touching the ground.
---
3. Same as 2,but it is no longer necessary to have talked to the intermediary flight paths you pass by to discover them. Also even more straight flight routes to shorten flight time.
---
I think for classic 2 would be acceptable, 3 definitely not.
---
Watch out, we got a edgelord over here
---
&gt; and then be like "ya, I'll save my energy for the NEXT wolf and just hit this one in the forehead a few times with my staff, why waste the mana".
---
Exactly - Vanilla WoW was about resource management, i.e. applying what you have efficiently so you can thrive. When you start out, this means whacking wolves with your wooden stick instead of burning it to a crisp with your Pyroblast, because that is what you have: A wooden stick and not enough mana. In due time, you *will* be roasting that wolf with a single instant cast, but that will be a reward for your effort to improve your character.
---
Honestly, that is what i want from a game: An environment that rewards me putting time and effort into conquering it. What I have come to immensely dislike is an environment where I play a power fantasy, because it does not feel earned in any way.
---
I concur
---
As someone who is admittedly very casual, is Classic playable for me? It seems like it's this very hard core game where more casual players will likely not be able to really do much at end game. Is this true though or can you still achieve a lot in spite of not being able to devote a lot of time?
---
Yeah my comment was satire I’m laughing with you at everyone spamming the same comment.
---
Everquest was created by people who wanted to play D&amp;D online. WoW was created by people who wanted to play everquest with better graphics.
---
Not better MMORPGs for sure, vanilla WoW is the peak of the genre.
---
"I prefer to AFK my gameplay. Nothing should be a struggle. I want to be gratified WHEN I WANT"

Back to retail you go
---
TIL that smoothMcgroove is streaming
---
I will be playing from work. Except I'm a contractor so I'll be in the middle East with 250 to 350ms ping which sucks. It will be a great way to pass the time though.
---
I'm pretty confident. And I feel yah. It's going to be a long weekend.

Tricksy hobbitsezzz

Don't you guys have cell phones?

"Player view distance", how far away players renders on each others screens in WSG, is this really correct? 
---
I've only watched streams and every single one whos played WSG has had the entire enemy team "phase" at the same time.

It makes you think layering/phasing is affecting WSG.

While I agree with you, just do some pushups when you're in flight. You'll never know the difference and you (hopefully) wont get fat. It's a win win.
---
Defcamp!!!!!!!
---
The bros
---
I am limited to Youtube at work so I mostly watch Defcamp. He really interacts with his viewers and takes extra time to test for bugs and the more detailed nuances of classic. He is a straight neckbeard tho.
---
From what I recall, it wasn’t as bad about 3 months ago.  Maybe it is just my eyes opening to toxicity, but with the recent influx, it seems to have become awful.
---
Good at everything, but not GREAT at anything.
---
I love the class and I'm rolling a Druid. So should you!
---
Honestly, both are good. Try both and play what feels more fun. If you hate the racial animations/fantasy etc. you will lose interest fast.
---
They should balance vanilla, a little bit.  Essentially,  fix class capabilities, give hybrid specs a bit more longevity in combat and even out some of the interactivity between classes in PvP.
---
In terms of the convenience stuff, very simple.  No cross realms shit.  No raid finder.  No teleporting.  No flying mounts.   Basically if players were complaining about it damaging immersion in the patch before TBC, dont do it.
---
Nah I mean, what time were you added to the list.
---
There seem to be a couple F&amp;F factors in play
---
1: Priority. The less people your reference used, the higher up on priority you should be. 
---
2: When you were added. if you were added early and were the only one your friend put on the F&amp;F list, you have a better chance
---
just take any picture and crop it?  
---
https://i.redd.it/kulotquzg7y21.jpg  
---
ragnaros is perfect shape for it
---
but there's more than the classic community, that's the point, some people want tbc just like we want classic
---
Bootybae is a damn good character name.
---
Enjoy BFA i guess?
---
Yeah I've mained feral since late Vanilla and even though other classes are definitely stronger in a lot of ways, I just can't help but love the class anyways.
---
Warlocks(felhunters) and Shamans purge our buffs and our hots, warriors and rogues have healing reduction, hunters can kite us for days and scatter+trap when we do close distance. 
---
We also lose overall power as Vanilla advances through the phases when burst gets even crazier and our hots and low damage do little.
---
I suspect there will be a lot of Druid players that make it to 15 or so and reroll. You gotta enjoy the class for what it is and enjoy the challenge. Despite all of the shortcomings I just end up missing Druid if I'm on any other class and that's why I'm gonna stick with it.
---
No! This is the original edition from 2005. 😉
---
Chuck?
---
&gt; It's like Final Fantasy. Doesn't get good until 100 hours in
---
ok wtf? 100 hrs? thats way too long for me to have to get to the fun. Vanila is fun by like level 6 at the latest for me
---
Ive seen some on the beta and niticed as well that the fp creatures also dont glide and flap at the right time. Like i saw one were the horde bad was gliding with a touren in the back mid climb out of undercity. And then flapping during decent
---
Holy shit, you're actually retarded. I can't believe I have to explain this.
---
Dr_Ambiorix mentioned that Asmon reported the keyring. The only point of him bringing this up is to add to the whole "streamers report bugs that aren't bugs" meme. Asmon has reported dozens of bugs, so that was the point of him bringing up this one specific thing. He doesn't think there should be a keyring in classic.
---
I pointed out that the keyring was added in 1.11 and should be a part of Classic, essentially calling Dr_Ambiorix out for his bullshit.
---
Then, you completely misinterpreted the entire conversation and basically repeated what I said. That was why I responded the way I did to you.

I don't think it's clunky at all at lvl 60. It's "clunky" at lower levels because your character is still meant to be a weak piece of shit, and it's an issue you are supposed to do something about. A game where you start out strong and stay strong throughout the whole game would not be an RPG.
---
Man screw repairs costs, the real salt is the lost buffs; those Mongoose pots are money mate.
---
Yeah I'd much rather one shot literally every enemy in the game and not have to manage resources. That's way more fun.
---
just to nit-pick but the normalized weapon speed was actually a hotfix. like a week or two after 1.8 which if you consider what just a massiv change it is for it to be a hotfix. but that is how the devs rolled in classic.

---
No.   Fuck no.  We arent doing wow puns.
---
LMAO. Killed me with that shit. Dude I'm too skinny, I can't lose weight or else I'll disappear. But you're right, seems like a solid plan for immersion.
---
He said the best MMORPG of all time, not the best game ever. And he's right, there is no MMORPG that has ever come even close to vanilla WoW.
---
Same dude, learned while researching. Guy is a killer on YouTube, now he plays Classic.
---
Could not agree more, specifically with the whole alternate timeline idea. I said that very thing a few months back. It honestly just seems like the best course of action.
---
Maybe the straight forwardness of the new flight made it easier to stop mid-flight to land quickly? Who knows
---
I don't think it gets fun until you get into dungeons, raids or PVP.
---
Echoooooo. (Echoooooo.... Echoooooo)
---
One of the most fun things in vanilla was a two hour tarren mill battle. 
---
Also there was one time we stealthed into the human starting zone, spawned an exploding sheep amongst the normal ones and waited for the new players to attack it. Instantly killed them. I admit it was a dick move but we laughed our asses off.
---
Thank you for chiming in, a veteran's opinion is worth a lot here, cause I don't have that much data to work with
---
Yeah it definitely should.
---
Thats the spirit, pal
---
Navashed.
---
Horde first level 30.
---
This seems purely graphical though and does not actually impact flight times...
---
Well I'd agree that retail leveling is bad. It's smoother and quicker but it's not mechanically engaging. However, you can level consistently level through dungeons and PVP which is how it should be.
---
Welllll, there's a reason why I have Alch either on my main or a close alt. Losing world/DM buffs, though... ouch.
---
quite partial to decimals, myself. But I suppose a float would be more precise.
---
I remember using Quartz (i think it was called) castbar, to see latency on my cast, with this i used a simple macro
---
*/Stopcasting*
---
*/Cast Fireball (rank x)*
---
The gist with that was to time your latency of when you could cast a new one for that ***maximum dps!*** 
---
As in, you dont have cast 100% of your spell it the latency was bad, maybe only 85 - 90%
---
Other then that, just good awareness of your surroundings when raiding and bring your consumables.
---
Even if it was only one button to press to dps, there are people out there that cant do that efficiently.
---
I bet it's that. You can even request a stop in classic which clearly wasn't present in vanilla.
---
2 is the only good option.
---
Nice back pedalling from him too, he was being true to the Vanilla Human Male Paladin!
---
It's not only some people, and it is absolutely no bizarre at all.
---
Classic WoW have something in it that will absolutely get a huge chunk of retail players into playing it much more often than retail. It won't be 3 months after Classic launch, and most guilds on retail will be unable to fill up 10 slots for a raid. This is already happening with plenty of guilds in retail.
---
They are scared because they know Classic is far superior, even if they will never admit it. And because they know it, they also know that many, MANY current retail players will abandon BfA for Classic.
---
They hate Classic, because retail will be a graveyard after Classic launches...and it won't recover, ever. Retail will be happy to be left with 500k players by December...problem is that those 500k players will be spread thin, most guilds will die or disband, some will merge...but once this starts (and it will), there is no coming back unless Blizzard pulls a miracle expansion after BfA, which I don't see how they will do it.
---
Retail is in real danger of becoming a really unpopular and barely populated game.
---
And it's not Classic's fault...Classic will only make it crystal clear that modern WoW is a third tier game that almost nobody will waste their time playing it.
---
I understand the fear of retail players...because it is real and the inevitable demise is basically just around the corner.
---
To each their own but I never was super duper into dungeons/raids. I just love adventuring the world. and for PvP wow isnt my MMO of choice tbh
---
downvote the streamer spam (and his stupid face)
---
Pushups also help build muscle.
---
Do yourself a favor and stay away from classic if thats how you feel. Current wow is trash, hope you enjoy that garbage and have somewhere to go.
---
A total legend. But he’s gonna have a bad time as a hunter if he doesn’t learn how to kite with an autoshot timer like Yaht.
---
Man you don't need anything that isn't threat meter and some kind of boss warning addon.
---
Cata 1000 needles was better imo. Vanilla is just barren.
---
Yes, but you did raise youelr staff skill.
---
Never even thought about that but it makes a ton of sense, and I will definitely use it. 
---
Amazing tip.
---
From a resto POV you bring battle rez and innervate but less overall healing than priest/shaman/pally. Balance doesn't have the mana to sustain damage and Feral doesn't scale well at all unless you farm MCPs/wolfshead etc and most people would rather just play rogue for the extra utility. 
---
So yeah, we are underplayed, but I enjoy the shapeshifting playstyle more than anything else so I'm still gonna roll Druid regardless.
---
People like him should play russian roullete with a full gun
---
So you admit the fun doesn't come from the combat when leveling.
---
The problem with WoW is that it doesn't really require groups and in fact the majority of people who have played WoW played for most of their time solo when leveling. It was successful because you could level solo and there was only a small amount of quest content that wasn't possible and that for the most part grinding mobs without quests was relatively rare compared to MMO games before it.
---
In my opinion vanilla doesn't enforce group leveling as well as older MMO games.
---
Eh? I heard them talking in chat yesterday and someone mentioned their Engineering was 215.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
Engineering/Mining on main. 
---
Herbalism/Alchemy on farm toon.
---
The ways of the gods.
---
I think they deserve a lot worst, think of all the people who had their games/characters ruined by "updates" when all they wanted was to play the original game
---
Classic is for everybody. People seem to forget that WoW was incredibly popular for a huge cross-section of gamers because it was so accessible. While you aren't going to be getting world firsts, raids need 40 people - you'll almost certainly be able to find your way into something. Similarly, PVP is very easy to get into, as the gear barrier isn't as pronounced.
---
Finally, the best thing WoW has going for it is the communities it built. You'll be able to find a good bunch of people to play with whenever you do log in, I'm certain of it.
---
not quite sure how you came to conclusion that rolling on weapon just for stats for you (while its weapon for others) is the same as other gear pieces (which are all stat stick for everyone)
---
Even tho 85% of the time I'll tab or walk away from my PC during flights I still want it to be as good as possible for the time I am there, and for others.
---
Legit
---
I don't find mana efficiency to be interesting. The problem of mana efficiency is that it is most efficient to do nothing for long stretches of time because of the 5 second rule. This leads to front loaded attacks and then auto attacking/wanding being the most efficient way to play.
---
Sorry I forgot the point of beta testing was being okay with every flaw
---
Like what? And why can't both be done?
---
I think a lot of people care about flightpath animations being the same. Or should. It's as important to immersion as vanilla weather and day/night cycles.
---
Do you... know what a beta is?
---
I can see the narcissist part, was watching his stream for a bit last night and he went afk so he put on a video for the stream. After he came back his viewers said his name got dropped a few minutes into the video, so he spends a minute going back to where his name gets dropped and the stream has to watch the whole damn video again.
---
Make sure you take mining
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/moo\_uk/clip/PatientGloriousMomTBTacoRight](https://www.twitch.tv/moo_uk/clip/PatientGloriousMomTBTacoRight)
---
6.1 is my best guess, added a video on that
---
Ah I remember this, IN THE MOUNTAINS
---
Do yourself a favor and expand your horizons beyond vanilla and retail. There is a whole world of games and other MMO games to learn from.
---
Not cool.
---
It's like the game isn't for everyone.
---
So.. people in your guild .. are they born between 2000-2019?
---
I heard you need 60 talent points in Beast Mastery before you can take him.
---
Ppl always forget movement/traveling. For example travel form for druids  or ghost wolf for shamans. As question was about enjoying class then those kind of things are big deal makers/breakers.  So 20 for shaman and hunter (cheetah) 30 for druid.
---
Other things are some spells what can change the way you play in some situations - for example warrior lvl 36 Whirlwind
---
Did you just tell somebody who wants Classic WoW to be an authentic vanilla experience to go play on a private server?
---
I wonder if you also criticize people who bring up possible inconsistencies between classic and vanilla as being too used to "wrong" private servers
---
You're here to repeat history and spread misery?
---
What is so “mediocre” about running out of mana? ...does anyone get it?
---
Class dependent and spec too, but for me and most classes, it got TRULY fun after 30.
---
I am a 40 year old vet. I am single, and have done that whole domestic thing. I am ready to settle in and play some WoW. Ooo-Rah!
---
I've tested a few MMOs. Blizzard set the standard and nothing compares to it.
---
Amazons biggest revenue is from AWS. It's about 35%. Not their online store.
---
yeah i hate to say it like that but idk how else to put it. anon’s on videogames can be volatile af these days. it’s definitely worse than it used to be.
---
You deserve nothing from Blizzard.
---
Aaaah good catch ! I wonder if they'll be able to separate the two...
---
The view is sooo important in this game... Sure some people are all about pvp and all, but what strikes me the most is the music, the feels in Elwynn, the gryphons, the thick smoke in the dwarf district, can't believe some people would dismiss this :/
---
Well, at least the people who will play will actually talk and communicate unlike current retail WoW. I hear talking and trying to be social with other players is frowned upon.
---
Can I just bounce up to max level on a private server to try out everything there?
---
Startattack wasn't around in vanilla. You need to run a script if this is in fact, nochanges.
---
Agreed.
---
Looks like they're already ruining classic too, I hope that's not the case.
---
I think regardless blizzard is going to end up losing their audience to private servers, and they can keep shutting them down like Nostalrius (Blizzard forced them to shut down because it was getting more players than Retail). Eventually,  they'll just  host start hosting in a country where the copyright laws don't apply.
---
I sincerely hope blizzard gets their shit together, and makes Classic a true classic wow experience.
---
Ugh you rogues are the fucking worst.
---
I don't know much about modern WoW but that sounds like what they did with EQ. The original model faces were all very distinctive but when they "improved" the models and customization you ended up with everyone who looked the same but with different color/style of hair.
---
They have the old client; they just figured it’s be easier and cheaper to slap classic on top of legion, and work from there.
---
Which sounds fine; but too many important, and potentially undocumented, changes occurred between Classic and legion - and all of them need to be corrected.
---
With that logic we could ride private jets... The looks and feel of it are really important. This kind of detail going away is one of those subtle changes to the game that made retail so unlikeable. We can't fly yet, so we rely on flight paths, and they look like shit. This definitely helps immersion, and immersion is key to a game like Classic.
---
There are no gems in classic.
---
Arena did nothing more to kill off wPvP than Battlegrounds did. Players who want to climb ranks never had any interest in wPvP from the moment Battlegrounds were introduced. 
---
The reason wPvP dropped significantly from Vanilla into TBC is because a huge chunk of the higher level playerbase immediately stopped interacting with Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms full stop, because there was nothing they were rewarded by in Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms, and in Outland they were flying past each other. 
---
If you're genuinely convinced that Arena was the final nail of wPvP's coffin, please explain your reasoning because that is a very unique outlook.
---
Nerfed in raids because only one hot is allowed on target. Similar to disc priests and power word shield.
---
uhhhh what???? They have the original source code for vanilla server and client, as well as original unmodified data. It's as far from guesswork as you could possible get. It is literally the original game as it was prior to the 2.0.1 TBC-prepatch. That's why it's the "reference" version of the game. The version by which Classic's modern re-implementation is compared against for accuracy. Dang you people are ignorant.
---
Jesus Christ. Stop posting everything the goddamn streamers do.
---
This isn’t anything worth discussing.
---
You’ll be fine dude, give it a shot. I’m a casual player to and absolutely love vanilla wow.
---
Nitpickers might want to go for nr. 1, atleast for the less direct flying from fp to fp (like og to ratchet flying alongside the coastline.) because I remember a remarkable difference from og to silithus for example.
---
Only if you're prepared for the grind.
---
Didn’t log in til midnight
---
WoW's art style has always been cartoony. They do it because going for "realistic" while trying to maintain a product that can be played on any outdated potato just turns into an uncanny valley mess. The vanilla graphics are cartoony.
---
I do agree that the *direction* they took the cartooniness seems to have shifted. Part of the problem with the new models is that they're unnecessarily over-animated. In addition a lot of the face options were interpreted very, very differently from what e.g. I would have done with them and did not remain distinct enough.
---
Either. Both are good in pvp and pve. Mages do more dps but raids require at least 3 locks for debuffs. Mages have a few raid specs depending on the patch while raiding warlocks have 2 raid specs that play identically.
---
Alternatively playing retail right now with my vanilla virgin gf. "Why the fuck are we one/two shotting everything? This is too damn easy!"
---
But is there any in vanilla?
---
This topic is repeated a lot, please use one of the other threads on this topic.
---
you mad bro?
---
&gt; Oh wait I mean fucking streamer didn't even report a single bug that whole run.
---
Top comment making a joke about streamers not reporting bugs
---
&gt; I know this is satire, but fun fact: He reported missing a keyring.
---
Response saying "I know you're joking but he actually did report a bug."
---
Then you go on to say whatever the fuck you said. Seems like you're misinterpreting this pretty hard.
---
Who thw fuck cares omg.... talk that stuff out on a discord and don‘t make a nonsense post about it
---
My brother is the random warrior that appears out of no where with no health. This video makes me die laughing!
---
Just for the record, I enjoy playing both retail and vanilla. However, I've been watching classic beta streams because I currently can't play it. Meanwhile, I have no interest in watching people play a game that I could play myself.
---
It's not so jarring for a lot of us. Taste is subjective like that. But on the flip side I understand why somebody else would hate that or why somebody else doesn't like the new art assets or doesn't like the old assets.
---
Less overall healing than the other healing classes (plus no real rez), subpar/borderline non-viable dps and tanking specs.
---
I main'ed a priest during Vanilla and messed around with a druid. My priest did literally everything better than my druid in equal gear.
---
I still enjoyed the druid playstyle overall and ended up main switching to him (resto) from BC-Legion. But in the world of Classic you might struggle a bit.
---
Druids will still be needed of course, but in a very limited capacity. So it really depends on what your ability to accept that. The class fantasy is fun yes, but if you do stick with a druid get used to being denied/overlooked often.
---
Brother in arms
---
Understand all the people that ruined World of Warcraft will be prompt and ready to go August 26.
---
Sure it can, the only thing I'm trying to point out here is that to say that something isn't "confirmed" because someone who worked at blizzard a decade ago says something. Blue posts are the only actual "confirmation". People all up in arms because I dare to point out facts.
---
I seem to remember at some point in vanilla blizzard streamlined flight paths to make them more direct and faster. Is it possible this is the reason for the difference?
---
Agreed, resubing for classic, retail is boring to hell. I've never been so unfulfilled playing a game.
---
I DM'ed for a group where the 3 non-wizard PCs decided to kill the wizard PC because he was getting too powerful.
---
Heed not to the whimperings of the plebians.
---
Which one? I played FFXIV,ESO,Aion,BDO etc. and they all were worse than classic imo.
---
**Gnomish Death Ray** is enough of a reason to level up Engineering and speccing Gnomish.
---
Well, given how classic wow isn't even technically released, I'd say we've got quite a while before we should be worrying.
---
You seem like an OG drood who knows katiz4fite. Could druids shapeshift out of roots/snares in vanilla?
---
Are soulstones going to stack?
---
Someone reports a bug in a beta test and your immediate reaction is "damn nochanges crowd" lmao. Really making a strong case against that evil #nochanges bogeyman that has nothing to do with this topic, dude. Keep fighting the good fight
---
We'll see when blue post comes out saying that it's currently working as intended :)
---
FYI they haven't worked on the game in over a decade, so it's safe to say their memory is possibly not up to par on the issue.
---
But go ahead and attempt your pathetic little personal insults just because I'm pointing out the fact that nothing is confirmed until a blue post says it is (or isn't).
---
I was part of the console toxicity for sure. I would have been around 13 on MW2 release. I recall about 1/4 of the guys in my class playing it - which was a lot when gamers were seen as nerds and the crossover between mainstream was only really coming to fruition.
---
I have definitely grown out of it, but I think there is something slightly different about this generation that makes it funnier: kids don’t realize how bad they are because the auto-mods ban vulgar words - which are usually the driving point for the convo. Example: compare “you are really bad” to “you are actually fucking trash at this game, why don’t you get gud dipshit” I remember getting called out for being bad in group games pushed me to be a better gamer and learn from these mistakes. I was scared to repeat them out of fear of being attacked..
---
These days kids fight each other and get toxic but something has been removed that properly conveys the message. Which is why my little brother (and the rest of his generation) think they are god-tier at CoD and Fortnite when they can’t even maintain a 1.0 KD.
---
Sorry I forgot that the internet thinks a tilting FP is more important than combat and quest bugs, since its more upvoted than any other bug. I simple forget I am on reddit sometimes.
---
I mean I get it, you really like RP aspect of the game, that's cool. Try and stay in situations where people can hold aggro for you. Like instances, or leveling with a hunter or warlock buddy. Enjoy that sweet sweet burst damage.
---
Yeah the first playthrough of all the new cata leveling was fun because you got to see how what we'd been up to before progressed.
---
...after 2 more times it got very *very* dull. But that's also a side consequence of leveling being a burden not an enjoyment which only got worse the more expacs came out.
---
Don't think so! Various videos show this lasted until TBC and probably later. It's not about being more direct, the gryphons evolve on a thread and don't work around this "Y axe" according to where they are, I think something got lost when they added mid-way stops
---
As much as I love classic, this is just delusional.
---
Especially from a raiding standpoint where live has vastly better designed, and vastly more challenging raids.
---
Of course there is another alternative outcome-If Classic is as big as we all hope, it could convince Blizzard to bring back the tougher feel of classic over to retail, scale down sharding, make the gearing system more rewarding and eliminate LFG &amp; LFD. Retail is more profitable for Blizzard than Classic servers due to micro transactions, so they will be motivated to try and convince players to pick up retail. And the only way to do that is to fix retail.
---
If your goal with these troll comments is to make people mad, then no, I'm not mad at you for feigning stupidity to get people riled up. I do feel sorry for you though.
---
Thats why I get down with Pathfinder, and in 2e they start even stronger!
---
To be fair, not everyone liked Vanilla. There's a ton of hype right now from almost everyone about it, but the truth is, 90% of the people that will be playing it on launch never wanted it to begin with and over half of them won't like it at all and that's okay.
---
We are masochists that come from the old school way of doing shit and we like running out of mana every 5 casts, hitting mobs with our staves and dying all the time. That's fun to us because we were dropped on our heads as children, but that doesn't make these opinions wrong. There are valid criticisms for Vanilla. It wasn't perfect, and you could very easily argue it wasn't really that "good" from an objective stand point. We just enjoy that type of shit and loved playing it. No need to circle jerk over what is honestly a very valid criticism.
---
Blizzard, in their quest to get all the casuals into wow, lost the dedicated players they started with because the game changed so much it was no longer fun for those who played at the start.
---
I agree. While the low level zones have a special place in my mind, especially your first taste of PvP in stonetalon or ashenvale, the 30+ zones are sweet. Really only a few I dont think are awesome
---
They feel threatened because they know retail is fucking dogshit garbage trash and that classic will outclass everything about retail.
---
No surprise they're scared, their game is about to become irrelevant.
---
So some people  were randomly selected for this beta, or was it all access via codes?
---
Jewelcrafting and gems were added in Burning Crusade.
---
Druids are kind of the laughing stock of vanilla. So are hunters... :(
---
I do love the smell of sulfur in the morning.  Brings back memories of the core.
---
It is absolutely not more noob friendly than BfA lmao. It's more noob friendly than other MMOs of its era like Everquest, but BfA is by far the most dumbed down version of WoW.
---
Dudes awful without Drakova to carry him
---
Kinda curious if "the maximum level" actually means 60 or if it could mean something like full Naxx epics or Rank 14.
---
My gut feeling is that it's just 60 though.
---
I have spent several months conditioning myself to not caring about whether or not I have world buffs. It used to bother me, but I have broken that feeling into submission. 
---
Now I'm happy when I have world buffs, but if I don't it's meh. 
---
Consumables represents farmhours though, I have to care about that a little bit.
---
You're not mentioning that magic missile cannot miss, making it very good consistent damage compared to range touch spells missing all the time because you are level 1
---
What people don't get is that in classic WoW, lvl 20 is just when things start getting good. Leveling was a real, integral part of the game back then. In Live nothing fun happens until you're max level, the leveling experience (even for the current xpac) is just a chore, a means to an end. But in vanilla, leveling *was* the game, and relatively speaking there wasn't a whole lot to do at max level besides raid. Low level BGs were just as competitive as max level, the dungeons were a real challenge, and the world was vast and deadly. You had real milestones and choices to make along the way, and the RPG elements mattered at all levels.
---
I feel the same about people who played for Vanilla and don’t want to pay for a monthly sub. Excluding people in countries were the price is unreasonable.
---
the orc stun resist is the most important pvp racial imo
---
you will win against paladins almost every time
---
Rogue for extra utility? Wdym?
---
Well since its all legion based code they could just flip a switch and have everything scale down right? literally type in some stuff have the Dark Portal open and the entire outland is scaled down to 60. same with Northrend get on the boat bam level 60 Northrend.
---
Scarlet Monastery has wrong lighting in the instance, too bright/warm.
---
Right lighting: [https://youtu.be/rwIh2xz7B7A?t=700](https://youtu.be/rwIh2xz7B7A?t=700)
---
I ver seriously doubt they will split up the games on twitch.
---
I don't see any scenario where Blizzard decides to take the number 4-6 spot and the number 8-10+ slot instead of just staying in the top 1-3.
---
You rarely ever use automatic dungeon and raid finder if you're a decent player.
---
Oh okay, but when were sockets added?
---
I agree, I remember watching the video and all the stuff you gotta gather for the quest lines. It seems easier to just farm herbs or ores for the gold. Although the quest is pretty fun.
---
And horses stopped being used regularly with the invention of the car.  You're standing on the side of the road screaming "cars made people use fewer  horses!" Yes.  You're right.  Even in that correctness it seems that wPvP is not as engaging as BG PvP.  You dislike this and as far as this conversation seems not many people agree with that opinion.  Since you're not altering your mind where does this need to go to reach a conclusion?
---
lmao it's so funny to me how almost all vanilla pvp vids follow the exact same formula. low quality video, rock/metal music, and the shitty zoom ins on every crit. good stuff mate
---
Same time
---
Yup exactly!
---
And you knew the person was a badass when you saw him/her riding it hahaha
---
Logging in, mechanics, mainly logging in.
---
Do you still remember how it was when you were playing TBC? That was similar to vanilla.
---
The first truly big change to hunters happened in WoTLK when they removed pet training and loyalty.
---
After that, big changes hit all classes, first locking into single specs, then removing trees entirely, weapon skills, ammo, weapon choices (only a single type of weapon now on retail) and many other things.
---
I will confirm that swapping weapons during a cast WAS possible in Vanilla and into TBC.
---
I used to play a Feral Druid.  When I had to pop out to heal, while casting Healing Touch, I'd swap to my Resto weapon/offhand to heal for so much more.  I was really sad when they took that away.
---
Think he means an official one.
---
Botting was huge back then. I remember those things where the characters would die and spell out words in stormwind and orgrimmar. Gold farmers
---
orgrimmar to everlook gives me the chills every time.
---
Oh God I remember the class forums on vanilla and how absolute crybaby rogues were. I remember the world of roguecraft videos. So good.
---
The winterspring frostsaber is unarmoured
---
Reminds me of “retail” haha
---
What's the thinking here, does the client tell the server when it started the cast on client side or something? So if you 400ms latency, there's 400ms of wiggleroom where the game shows you casting but actually you already sort of finished the cast?
---
Where's your proof? Or theirs for that matter?
---
As someone who started with ADnD (far, far before my time, I'm in my 20s), I actually really like the changes they've made in 5ed. Wizards feel like wizards right away but you don't get the big guns until an appropriate time. Fighters feel like beefy fighters but not the amazing all around combatant until later. Rogues are sneaky but you don't get to Grey Fox level until much later.
---
Lot more accessible to newbs as well, less math and less complexity leaves more room for RP imho
---
Yes, its preferred to go gnomish for battle chicken, and then swap to goblin for crafting sapper charges and the winterspring teleporter for jujus and getting a quick songflower buff in nearby felwood.
---
And I think masturbaing with an oiled up melon stuffed with warm ham is magical, but I can't make other people agree with me.  I mean, it's fluid and real....
---
I thought you were saying they were slower or the pathing was different. I just misread your post. I don't disagree in regards to the athetics, but from a functional perspective it seems equivalent.
---
Depends what you plan on doing. I was watching staysafe about orc vs undead for warlock and he gave me a pretty simple answer but also made sense. For PVP what counters a warlock , stuns. Therefore the 25 % stun resist from ORC is better then WOTF .....
---
I think forcing other people to do my idea of fun is the best way to exist.
---
You can make that argument but it's a bad argument because the level of inbalance between bis and fresh 60/70 on tbc is much higher. It's not the same example because in comparison tbc is just a worse offender for the scenario
---

---
You mean to write *"could've"*. That's how you spell that fast "could have". 
---
You never put *"of"* after *"could"* - That never happens in english.
---
Have a nice day.
---
You are correct. Rarely if ever will you DoT a boss, but trash that’s being AoE’d and tanked usually gets dotted first thing.
---
Shows how toxic the Classic community will probably be.
---
It's not gonna be the community I remember from vanilla, that's for sure.
---
I don't care what haters have to say to be really honest. I am happy I get to experience the best version of WoW after 14 years. Nobody can take that away from me.
---
I am looking forward to meeting new friends, join a guild and grind in Classic.
---
Fraction
---
Ya that felt really good, especially if had the gold for your mount. Loved getting plate armor on my warrior.
---
There are many old games with thriving modding communities. Look at how many people play TES: Oblivion with HD models and textures. Look at all the FFVII mods out there. Morrowind. KOTOR. FFX.
---
Starcraft and Warcraft 3 just got updated graphics, but same gameplay.
---
So it really is quite subjective.
---
You can still get these as tmog from darkmoon faire. Been rocking the lightforge set for years now.  (Just so you know)
---
McConnell is that annoying friend that you hate 75% of the time but that other 25% let's him stay relevant in the friend group.
---
fairly sure we are going to get layering.
---
There are easy ways to eliminate layer hopping exploits, hopefully Blizzard will use them.
---
Troll women still  thicc
---
Not even just from a questing/zone POV, but from a talent one, too. Warrior, hunter, rogue, pretty much every class starts to feel somewhat diverse and powerful after 30/40.
---
Maybe. Maybe not.
---
I agree. It's more about immersion and all
---
Let's be honest, how many of you actually want people from the *World of Warcraft forums* to play Classic? Are we gonna petition all the lovely folks at MMOChamp to try it out too? Posts like this should be celebrated, that level 2 wolf in Deathknell did us all a huge favor
---
The shaman standing his ground like a true vanilla player.
---
its kinda funny because after they posted this i saw a bunch of other people get invited. Idk if its because they know people at blizzard or had a friend contact someone at blizz. But feel like more and more people got into the beta after this post.
---
Well he's posting in the general discussion which is full of classic haters. To be expected. He'd rather everything die in 2 hits and hit max level in a day. I want my rpg back.
---
Classic in a NUTSHELL
---
The thing about artistic taste is that it's very subjective. So no, personal taste over the old or new models isn't black and white.
---
The new models being higher poly with higher resolution textures is black and white. Whether somebody likes the way it all comes together definitely is not.
---
I would like to see an optional client-side option to use updated models. But it really isn't a mystery why somebody else wouldn't. People clearly state it. The old models are part of the nostalgia for them, and an important part of the vanilla atmosphere for them. Not all of us are attached to the graphics, but some people are, and it's every bit as vital to them as the game mechanics are. It's an important part of the trip down memory lane.
---
I think people are being a little ridiculous on both sides here trying to dictate what other people should like and telling them they're wrong for not having the same subjective taste.
---
Alliance having better queue times seems like a good bet. Horde will probably be more populated, and more pvp focused people will roll there. Meanwhile pve focused people will shift to alliance.
---
There's actually lots of casual content to see in classic. Honestly the only things I consider "hardcore" (in the sense that you need to devote time to organize properly) are doing BWL, AQ40, and Naxx. You can PUG MC, only, aq20, and zg. You can do those as a casual guild as well. In fact, I'm pretty sure most casual guilds will just do MC/only in the first few phases and add on AQ20 and ZG later on. The nice thing with that is that ZG/AQ20 are pretty well itemized so you won't feel like you're falling super behind.  
---
If you just want to PvP, you can just get rank 10 (which only requires modest effort to reach). The blue set is an excellent set for most classes and will keep you competitive. Many great weapons are craftable or are drops from easy to do dungeons and raids.
---
There's content to do for every type of gamer. Just gotta find your place.
---
Why would you even take that out of retail is the question I have. I haven't played in a while but that makes no sense.
---
I'm not on the beta, I cannot test combat bugs. What I can do is observe and tell when something is wrong. I'm not ranking that above the rest, just trying to help get the original experience. I hope you can drop the attitude and just respect the fact some people care about different things than you.
---
No it won't, people are expecting it to but things change and rolling a game back isn't rolling time back.
---
Thanks for making this. I think I'll be doing everything maxed out except for shadows. I prefer the happier ultra setting. I'm one of the few that likes the new water though even though I played vanilla. It will be nice to see the difference coming from a private server as well.
---
Copying my reply to another - 
---
before TBC, almost all epics you got were received after killing a boss - so you could celebrate with your friends upon getting the piece of loot. and, you could look at a piece of loot in your inventory and remember "hey, I got that when we killed nef that one time with 5 people left alive." I've got a problem with Naxx/AQ as well with how the class tier loot plays out, but it wasn't as bad as the token system.
---
No worries my friend. I wasn’t a hardcore raider until I got in a good guild in TBC so they’re probably right. Overall I enjoy PVP more..mechanics can be memorized and beaten. Players will always end up doing something different..for better or worse..lol.
---
In my opinion Classic will be better for casual players because there's less focus on raiding. There were tons of people back in 2005 and 2006 that just never raided. Many of them never even hit max level. It was perfectly fine to just log in once a week to do a few quests and then catch a fish or two.
---
Got mine a few months ago for like 25 euro, very good condition for its age
---
Fear beyond OP
---
From what i've been told layering is for the first few weeks of launch to help with server stability and wont be there when the PVP system launches. Will they keep there word on that. It remains to be seen
---
Why don't you just try to understand the nuances we're trying to tell you instead of downvoting?
---
I mean I already explained this in way too much depth in the previous post. I'm sorry that you're incapable of understanding simple conversations. Asmon has submitted a lot of bug reports. The only reason why he cherry picked that specific bug report was because he was insinuating that the keyring thing wasn't a bug.
---
One of the zones I basically mourned in the Cataclysm (along with Azshara for the lore). I have fond memories of running from centaurs. And oh, the shimmering flats! I’m going to see you again, pre-Deathwing Kalimdor.
---
that's not difficult it's just slower gameplay.  it's a preference
---
Honestly, people like this don’t want a challenge. They want to boosted to max level. Pathetic.
---
Imagine if classic does so well, they start releasing new content for it. Wow.
---
You could play the original vanilla if updated models were a client-side option of some sort that you are not required to use.
---
You literally die of boredom leveling in WoW in the past 3-4 expansions. It has gotten full retard, i\`m sorry for the ones that enjoy what has become a mobile gaming experience. Seeing streams with classic  confirmed me that i\`m not crazy and i do really want to go back to the game i fell back in love with in 2014 in beta.   
---
Valid criticism is not "oh look i hev to think and doorp can\`t fall asleep at the kb while i lvl woaaa woaaa"
---
um yes, thats kinda their main thing is to shapeshift out of roots/snares
---
Part of me likes to think that it's actually a screening process.
---
That way only good people play and we can have an awesome community.
---
WoW was fun because of the community, that doesn't exist anymore in retail. Sharding and LFG had totally killed server based communities.
---
Ideally it would be like Path if Exile, where you have your ladder and non-ladder.  They create a new "server" and still keep the old server.  Then after some time, those servers merge and they make another new one.  Everyone wins.
---
They’ve spent over a decade in the same game amassing achievements, mounts, chars etc. I would be worried if they weren’t defensive
---
What happened at the end? Can someone explain please?
---
I mean i could copy paste the comment you replied to here. Buying loot isnt as fun as the excitement you get from being the 1 out of 40 to get the loot some crazy hard boss had.
---
Sometimes less is more.
---
I don't think everyone realises what an advantage nameplates are.
---
Shroud himself was playing with someone last night and they were playing around with enemy nameplates. Shroud said something like "I don't know why anyone would use nameplates outside of RP reasons".
---
It also has a lot to do with the entitlement generation, some say.
---
1 day for 10 epics vs 10 days for 1 epic
---
No. This didn't get added until WotLK, as I recall. You do have access to soul bags (which only hold soul shards) which are generally higher capacity than bags possess at that level.
---
Soul bags are available when you do demon summoning quests for both Succubus and Felhunter. There are also larger crafted bags available at tailoring 300.
---
I dont think well see an open beta. Just like I dont think we will see the beta hit level 60. All the raid testing and such will most likely be done behind the scenes.
---
Its not damage wise but its murdering it when you hit a roadblock and you need a strong core of likeminded players.
---
People doing less damage than the tank (and this really is no hyperbole, enh shamans and ret palas are that bad) will tear the raid apart if they have a high standing in the guild.
---
You either 
---
a) cut the slackers and shitty specs which you cant if the paladin is an officer or god forbid RL
---
b) people will start leaving because they know entitled players with bad specs soak up gear that can make or break fights. 
---
I personally was quite pissed when my guild started inviting people people with IBS and level 50 quest rewards to the raid and they got loot while I did my due diligence gearing so I dont shit all over other people's time investment. I just cant stand slackers and leeches. 
---
A warrior puts stuff like BRE, onslaught etc. to much better use, so people will
---
If you take time off work and sleep less than like 10 hours per day and spend the majority of your time on leveling you'll be far ahead of the pack. As long as you play like more than 8 hours a day actually leveling you'll be ok. If you wanna be like among the first few and have almost empty zones you'll need to play more like 18 hours of efficient leveling per day.

hunters is not for damage :3

At level 20, as a Mage, you then have a choice between continuing to quest or to AoE grind the further levels. If you're ahead of the pack and want to maintain momentum, I would argue in favour of AoE grinding using [this spec (for level 20).](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZZMhMhz) Personally, I intend to play mage and I intend to AoE grind to level.
---
He is right. Ordinary person can't play it. You have to sacrifice your life and family for wow classic.
---
NO NO NO DON'T PLAY CLASSIC DON'T GO DON'T LEAVE ME WHO WILL LOOK AT MY MOUNTS NOW
---
I don't want your kindness, friend! 
---
Thank you for the offer though
---
Ye dude they totally deserve the hundreds of millions of dollars that they are gonna get from people playing classic...damn dude we sure showed them huh...
---
Me too! But keep the gold sink. Shift that gold cost to unlock taxi systems with slow or fast taxies to reach places that require flight to reach.
---
I want to see all expansions with those kinds of QoL removed. Brack's idea of "pristine servers" he mentioned some time back really interested me and I'd like to see it taken just a few steps further.
---
Faction cities we're never separate. I guess that's what dude is saying?
---
i loved the whole vanilla experience, tbc and wrath were also really good, but in vanilla i was in a casual, they wanted to be hardcore and raided the times but most of the members were really bad at raiding xD, so most of what i did was the end game dungeons and the things you could do in them, got myself attuned to naxx as it was all done outside raids, got my full dungeon set and upgraded it with a group of friends, still have some of the items needed in my mages bank on retail. there was so much to do but since cata/pandaland the stuff you can do at max level just felt really repetitive and other than that there was only raiding
---
I think layering is a good solution if it is gone after 2 weeks or so.
---
Search terms don't really mean anything. It's natural for a game to be highly searched around windows where it gets a lot of news and attention.
---
The layering technique Blizzard is opting to do is actually kind of great because it eliminates the need for more servers. It's no secret that a lot of people quit the game early on. That's not a dig at Classic - that's an easily trackable trend with just about every game. What we will see after the initial rush window is a more stable server situation than what ended up playing out on Live, which ended up with free server transfers and eventually connected realms.
---
I just want to see them do something about layer hopping. I realize the tech probably isn't going anywhere, but it's kind of scary to think of the damage it could cause.
---
We've all wanted a great classic experience and that could easily change with something of this magnitude. That doesn't mean it will, but its possible. There will be people layer hopping to farm nodes and mobs if Blizz does nothing to stop it.
---

Layering
---
Literally one of my biggest disappointments with BfA, every single prof that wasnt herbalism/alchemy was fucking *worthless*
---
I hear that in vanilla, after you get your BiS available from professions there isn't much point to them though? Like people change to Engineering?
---
All i remember was my cast bar was changed, at the end of the bar it was "filled out" in red with your latency, so for every cast you did, it would change the "complete cast stage", sometimes 99% of your bar was filled, other time maybe 90%, if that makes sense
---
So when you came close or rather inside that red line, you could start to cast a new spell
---
&gt;  In Live nothing fun happens until you're max level,
---
required ilv *
---
Sap, lockpick, vanish
---
If the new posters on this sub are any indication, they are going to ruin our game as well. Enjoy it while it lasts.
---
Who dat
---
For me classic got awesome around STV levels upwards.
---
You'll be fine. It's for everyone. The beauty of it is that you can go at your own pace. You'll actually get to appreciate the zones, quests, etc more because you'll spend more time in them. Everything matters. Pvp at lower levels is still fun, building your talent tree however you'd like, more skills to play with, etc. The society is a lot more fun too since everyone you see will be on your server, people will build reputations and relationships with others and it's more conducive to a friendly environment. World pvp is always fun and ganking in stv will never get old. If you play, I'd recommend going on a pvp server. It'll be tough in some parts of the leveling process but will pay off in the end. I'm older and won't have near as much time as I did playing vanilla but that's ok, classic is all about the ride, not necessarily the destination.
---
I know you're talking about the tip at the bottom of the screen, but your title and this picture gave me flashbacks of the Full Blue Bar. The hardest raid boss in the game.

It's completely identical to what the official one was. Who cares if it's official? This subreddit isn't official. MMO Champion isn't official.

It won’t effect the economy at all.  It’s not like each layer will have its own independent auction house.  They’ll get rid of it, at the latest, when the first major patch cycle occurs.  It’s not that big of a deal, the exploits related to it will be ironed out during beta, and they’re not even that plentiful or impactful.
---
&gt; If anything professions were gutted in BC.
---
? Professions were the strongest overall they had ever been
---
Profs besides engi actually had huge benefit.
---
&gt;Care to give some examples of class homogenization?
---
Yes the began giving all the raid buffs to 2 class/specs. Dont need an enhance shaman and a DK. One is fine. 
---
Dont need a shadow priest anymore. 
---
&gt;Wrath-Logo-Small Patch 3.2.0 (04-Aug-2009): This buff now grants 1% of the target's maximum mana over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second. This applies to all 5 sources of Replenishment (Vampiric Touch, Judgements of the Wise, Hunting Party, Enduring Winter Frostbolts and Soul Leech).
---
it goes on.
---
"live has vastly better designed, and vastly more challenging raids."
---
(X) doubt
---
Yup, people need to realise that’s it’s OK to enjoy both lol. They bring vastly different things and are different games at this point.
---
thats only in raid ,while everyone AOE the thrash
---
I would personally go in fresh. I think it is more fun going in completely blind. The game is fairly easy to learn so I think you wont have any issues.
---
What if I told you that you can discuss ideas, pipe dreams, and "what I would do" without actually hoping to see it happen in place of authentic server options or actually expecting it to happen ever at all.
---
I've heard of normalization quite a bit but also remember playing during TBC as a rogue that two weapons of the same DPS but differing speeds, the slower weapon was always stronger. Is it because the white hits are higher over the course of a fight even though they will have slightly fewer?
---
Found the zoomer
---
Poor little guy cant handle not getting his instant gratification.
---
"What the hell? The game doesn't hand me all my eins on a silver platter and I have to work for it?... this f***ing sucks!"
---
Freaking neanderthals ruined world of warcraft for and turned live wow into a shitty shallow experience because it had to cater to people who can't be bothered to put in actual effort. 
---
And now when the game finally caters to the original fans, these neanderthalls have the gall to complain about it. Disgraceful.
---
This is why you don't do drugs, kids.
---
You guys got some shitty parents. My parents love it when I play video games! My mom says it's great that they make me happy and my dad is happy that they got me into my profession (I work in networking)
---
My parents do the same thing with the TV though - my mom always "watches" TV, usually those stupid police procedural shows and plays lots of games on her phone. I say "watches" because she usually falls asleep haha. But she has no problem with what I do for fun, so whatever if she wants to sleep in front of the TV.
---
My dad doesn't care about the TV - he'll sit in the chair even if the TV is off. He's usually doing sudokus on his phone though. He's got a serious addiction to them - he gets pretty mad if you interrupt him when he's doing one, which is a problem because hes ALWAYS doing them if he's in the house. The rest of the time he spends taking care of his bees (he has six hives) or building stuff for the bees in his workshop. Pretty cool hobby I'd say.
---
Shame all you guys have parents that hate video games. Mine understand the stuff they do on their phones are games too, and are happy I play games. My dad even use to play computer games a lot when I was a kid/teenager. Maybe it's because my dads an engineer and my moms an accountant - both nerds haha.
---
I am a casual. Played from vanilla to bfa. The new expansions have helped in some ways for casuals but also broke some stuff. I will personally play Classic, it is a whole different game, only the name and the universe is the same, but the game itself is different. The thing you will notice the most ad a casual is that things take more time to accomplish, so you will spend more time working toward achievement a single goal, but that goal will be more rewarding.
---
Thats kind of crap. I liked Vanilla and im exited for classix, but this is a quality of life thing that would be great
---
I'd imagine if they played BFA they'd have respectable numbers.
---
And obviously numbers are inflated currently for Classic because of the hype and the fact the game isn't playable for the vats majority yet.
---
This is an outrage! I will avenge my fallen Horde brother 10 fold!
---
That actually plays in to what I said. It’s all the same level but a lot of communication is stifled because of this attitude of trying to prevent it. And it certainly isn’t the kids causing it. By “fixing” toxicity it’s changed it’s route of expression, not level of volatility.
---
You should try both Classic and Retail. I mean why not? You get access to both with the subscription. 
---
They're very different games and, despite what some people might, retail isn't bad, it's just a game they don't like. You might like it.

My Imp didn't seem to have voice acted lines in the Stress test. I'm not sure if this was a feature added later in WoW's lifespan but I hope it's a bug because hearing his screechy little laugh and his random comments ("I think we should see other warlocks") added just a little bit more personality to the demon.

Wait for Classic. Don't waste your time in BFA like the rest of us mortals without beta Access.
---
Depends on server
---
Stormrage = Alliance heavy 
---
Illidan = Horde heavy
---
For general realms horde will be the majority just like vanilla... which I would assume call for longer queue times and Alliance dominating bgs since "good players" will go Alliance to try and balance.
---
I’m surprised nobody has told you yet but there’s no jewelcrafting in Vanilla.  Just as a heads up.
---
He wouldn't be out of mana before the wolf dies though. By my calculations undead mages have 135 mana at level 1, which is enough for 4 casts of rank 1 fireball (30 mana). Add in the DoT effect (which should tick at least once between every cast) and the wolf should die... unless it resists.
---
Agree with this
---
Kids today simply do not have attention span to fully enjoy MMOs like Classic WoW. They want instant gratification, thats why MOBA and Battle royale genres are so popular. 30 minutes and thats it. In Classic 30 minutes is sometimes not enough to form a party and enter the dungeon.
---
This. Character creation color wasn't very neutral.

The circlejerk is "vanilla sucks, it's boring, muh nostalgia goggles, ackchually you won't have fun in it".

Your name is "ClassicPurist" and I would take any bet that you haven't raided mythic at a respectable level in WoW any time recently.
---
Your literally doing the same thing they are. Your attacking retail to defend classic.
---
Yeeeee
---
I mean, as I said, I also enjoy Classic/Vanilla style. I played FFXI for 7 years straight which was even more grindy and hardcore than WoW was. But it's not as simple as calling him a retard that wants to faceroll shit. Let's be honest, at level 5, you really do just cast 4 nukes and then auto attack. You literally CAN fall asleep at the keyboard just as easily if not more easily than retail, it's not "harder" than having infinite mana, it's just more time consuming and frustrating. We like that, it's fun to us, but saying that isn't fun or well designed is a valid criticism whether you agree with it or not.
---
Also, did you mean 2004 and not 2014? Because 2014 was Panda/WoD, the worst eras of WoW and way more retail than it was "vanilla"....
---
If you want the underdog I would go to Alliance!
---
Yeyeyeyeye

not sure what you could learn that would carry over from retail, if anything you'd learn a bunch of wrong

I would wait until classic. The 2 games are way to different.
---
Yet you’re acting the same way. Are you saying classic is dog shot?
---
Only issue is they don't interfere with a regular servers faction imbalance so I don't see why they would care if layers were not clost to a 1:1
---
They'll just say "it's only for phase 1" - which is getting old.
---
Man he missed the fun part. Talents get so good after 20. 
---
I got into WoW fairly late, a few months before BC came out, but my friends, who had played endgame raids already convinced me to just stay at 49 and PVP with them on their alts.
---
That was an insanely fun time; group of 5 friends just wrecking in battlegrounds.
---
Many youtubers/twitchers with direct contact to blizzard didn't get access myself included.
---
That was to the "I like the idea of non-linked".....That'd make shopping a nightmare.  Nah, I don't want to play World of Shopping.
---
Think about it, if you go in fresh to Classic, you’ll get to experience wow from the very beginning like a lot of us did. I wouldn’t pass up that chance if I had it. Live will always be there when you’re ready for it.
---
YoU dOnT eVeN hAvE hIeeRlOoMs!?

---
My thoughts were just that I would learn the different classes and the general feel of them, so that I would know what I want to level first when Classic comes out. Are the classes just wildly different in live now that it would be a bad idea?
---
Someone hopping layers and farming thorium to throw on the AH is not going to affect the economy? That's just one example but it could really do some damage if it's left unchecked. Each of these layers has their own spawn for nodes and mobs, and its just as easy as joining a group to switch to another layer.
---
Or what if someone figures out a way to hop and farm black lotus, and works up whole stacks, then pretty much controls it's price.
---
It's what happens with retail WoW, I've said for years that sharding was the worst thing Blizzard ever did to WoW, and layering isn't *that* much different, just on one server.
---
I think the most obvious interpretation wasn't to insinuate they were being sarcastic by pointing out he reported a bug, but that's just me and we already know how the education system has failed me and our country. Not sure why you're bothering to respond anymore when you're clearly the superior intellectual here. I'll see you around in twitch chat you big brain you.
---
If you haven't had any interest in Cata - BFA you'll not benefit from hopping in now.
---
Enjoy the summer and see you August 26/27
---
Doubt all you want it's a very commonly held belief and theres a lot of data to back that up. The encounters are much more intricate and clever on average than almost any classic fight. It's just natural, the people who have been designing raid and dungeon fights have just gotten better over the years.
---
I think that some of this comes from toxic people on both side of it. People that love classic keep on saying that the retail peoples ruined their game and retail people are saying that classic gameplay sucks. Both of those people are wrong, they just love different types of games, but both sides keep on shitting on the other side. Vocal gamers are a weird type of people, instead of saying how great their game is, they keep on shitting on games other people like. COD sucks! Battlefield sucks! Fortnite sucks! All of those games are great games, proof millions of people play them, but instead of praising what they love they shit on the other ones. Same thing happening between classic and retail. Majority is happy with one or the others, but the vocal part of each keeps on shitting on the other one.
---
Everyone here says they're not good at anything, just average at healing, battle res, and other healer support are extremely important, and someone whos really good can keep up with other healers easily. There's nothing wrong with HOT healing and knowing when and when not to use swiftmend, try one on p servers
---
You’re forgetting an important racial: mount appearance.
---
yes, classes have each gone through multiple reworks since classic
---
Very true, I know that feeling from plenty of other games. I like that point of view.
---
This I can agree with, the large majority of tourists aren't going to get very far past level 20.
---
Just anything to make it less exploitable.
---
You can macro a weapon swap. Early vanilla it didn't cause a GCD, but I think they made it happen in vanilla 1.8 maybe. Either way, it'd still be useful to have for solo play even when the GCD. Weapon swap after opener, swap back after a gouge, etc. Just more poisons.
---
I like the layering. I will actually be able to enjoy the game the first week it is released.
---
 I honestly do not get the outcry at all. I joined vanilla when BWL was released. Huge disadvantage and behind the curve. However I ended up getting into Naxx and  being a top mage on my realm after playing a lot. Even if people get a massive advantage in the first few weeks due to layer hopping it honestly is not going to make a difference.
---
This is super important! This needs to be fixed =)
---
Leveling or 30 content? I could stream my 30 priest
---
The lack of self awareness in this thread is hilarious.
---
shit meme
---
what important stuff do you think needs to be fixed ASAP, that fixing flight paths would get in the way of?
---
I could, yes? That wasn't the question?
---
Good luck trying to aoe level any time within the first 3-4 months (if you were leaning towards trying that)
---
Would say it's more about faction leveling than class leveling. 
---
Only thing I'd recommend is looking at what skills you can afford not to purchase on the way to 40.
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Maybe you misunderstood.  Id like him cease to be alive.
---
If he means FFXI, then he's wrong, it takes even longer. It's more like a thousand or so back in the day on your first class. It took me about a year to get my first 75 and that was with me playing literally every day. Think I clocked about 17k+ hours in the game before I quit in 2009ish.
---
Saying "until it gets good" is not really right though, imo. Obviously you are having fun along the way, exploring and helping/getting help from friends, if you aren't having fun doing that stuff you shouldn't be playing. But you are basically a little garbage can until max level when you have all your abilities and gear, and it takes much longer than 100 hours to get there on your first class (All classes are done on one character). It is much faster though on subsequent classes when you can easily afford gear and know what you are doing, though it still takes a long time.
---
There was also huge hurdles to even get into leveling areas. You know how you had to attune to raids and shit in WoW and it took forever? There was shit like that at level 30(75 was cap) just to get to certain areas in FFXI. You had to do a huge quest line that you needed a lot of help with or pay 500k, which was a fucking huge amount, so realistically you had to do the quest. There were alternatives and you could skip that area specifically, iirc, but they were inferior and I don't think most people did skip them.
---
I would say FFXI was more hardcore than Vanilla ever was, because it's a Japanese game and older, it was more like Everyquest and stuff. I actually tried to play Vanilla a lot of times and never made it to max level because it was too easy at the time and I was still in love with FFXI. Unfortunately, much like with what they did with WoW, a lot of the later expansions completely ruined the game and that is why I finally quit and jumped over to WoW during Wrath and actually started playing seriously at that point and raiding. But I'd be way more hyped about a Vanilla FFXI than WoW. Maybe they will see the success of Classic WoW and try to do the same thing, that would be dope. I imagine some of the  Vanilla WoW players that never experienced FFXI might enjoy it as well.
---
I got banned from his discord for asking for tanking advice in Wailing Caverns :(
---
Imagine people with differing views, not all of us have to think the same way.
---
- Vanilla Vet (planning on playing classic for years)
---
That's 100% the reason I hope they don't put arena in Classic. I'm a mainly PVP player but vanilla was unbalanced, and it should stay that way. The second they put arena in, it gives everyone the valid complaint that they don't have a fair chance in a competitive environment.
---
I know this might sound bad but I was expecting to be invited because I've been subbed nonstop since 2004 :( I hear OGs get higher priority but I'm not sure if that confirmed by them or a rumor
---
I hope you like auto-attacking. Leveling a pally is pretty mind-numbing for the most part.
---
Depends on your priorities. Classic WoW is much more *social*. Things take longer, but that also means you shouldn't feel like you need to rush everything.
---
I spent like 4 months at 49, on my first character with my friends just playing battlegrounds. Such a good time
---
.
---
Sure, the leveling grind is real, but I felt the "grind" part of WoW only got worse in every expansion.
---
At least leveling felt rewarding. Getting to 40, 50, 60, were all achievements in their own right. And it felt good.
---
In expansion you just had to grind lots of other shit that felt less important than a level. Infinite quests that boiled down to a dot on the map, and never felt rewarding. That's a grind.
---
Doesn’t matter. Just wanna see priest stuff
---
i mean, you are literally on the sub for r/classicwow and complaining that we're taking a dump on retail... what exactly is the point of your post?
---
I used to play the auction house and see how much money I could make from flipping items. It was a fun little side game
---
Cloth is the best stats for most druids/shaman as well as healers, as they're healbots thru vanilla. Sadly, that means sharing with them
---
I remember seeing that in vanilla and thinking it was really cool that they tilted when turning.
---
A lot of people in this sub feel very burned by how bad bfa is. I really enjoyed legion and then it feels like blizzard slapped me with bfa right after.
---
How would layering or phasing ever be able to affect a battleground? There is no way that'll ever happen for very very obvious reasons.
---
"This is just an empty canvas."
---
TBC was the height of professions I think for me
---
A paladin that actually knows what he’s doing
---
Healbot is pro

---
&gt; Someone hopping layers and farming thorium to throw on the AH is not going to affect the economy? 
---
No because literally anyone can do it if there’s other layers up.  The layers won’t be there if there’s not a reason, due to population, for them to be there at any given moment.  That means the next layer will also have people competing for your thorium.  Will there be additional thorium compared to a single layer?  Yes.  Will it matter?  Hardly.
---
&gt; Or what if someone figures out a way to hop and farm black lotus, and works up whole stacks, then pretty much controls it's price.
---
Blizzard will be monitoring for this sort of thing.  They’ve said they’re going to work out the abusable kinks before the game goes live.  Layers also, as mentioned above, won’t exist when there’s not a population need for them.  That means no one person will have easy access to any one material.  There will always be competition.
---
&gt; It's what happens with retail WoW, I've said for years that sharding was the worst thing Blizzard ever did to WoW, and layering isn't that much different, just on one server.
---
Layering isn’t sharing.  Even if it was there’s plenty of worse things that Blizzard has done to the game, even in terms of server community, than sharding.
---
I must be in the minority but I always loved the flight paths. I really hope the lifelessness is fixed :(
---
Lmao, the classic base is completely different from the live base. They are two different games and classic will attract people who aren't interested in the game currently. As for twitch, Classic WoW is dominating live WoW. I know your anger comes from a place of fear, but the reality is that modern WoW has been bleeding subs for a very long time. Start of Draenor over 10 million players played. Now it's between 1-2 million. It's in a very bad spot no matter what your feelings on the matter are.
---
True. And I'm not proposing not allowing for a faction imbalance. Just to try and keep it at nothing more than say 45/55. This would still allow for the feeling if imbalance, but without the deleterious effects of a server with a 3:1 ratio. Vastly imbalanced servers would become ghost towns and could hurt the long term possibilities of the future success of Classic (or possible future support ie TBC &amp; Wrath).
---
Flying from darn to silithus for aq takes 15 minutes... lmao
---
And now in modern WoW: You walk around in a starting zone at level 14 and find a full blown dragon flying around...level 18-20 elite. You crush it with zero effort in your white gear, maybe with two +1 stat greens.
---
And then you weep. What the fuck was that? Was it supposed to be some kind of dragon balloon prank? Why did an actual full-blown rare dragon just fall over and die when you barely poked it with a stick? What is life?
---
Vanilla was toxic but to a lesser extent. We just remember the good times. But since the community was tighter, you just wrote the guys name and continued your journey ignoring him.
---
at this point it looks like youre not even finding anything that bad so youre just looking at random things to complain
---
Live won't teach you shit about Classic. If anything it'll teach you bad habits. If you want to practice, play a private server. Or you can go in completely fresh. It depends on if you want to be a bit more casual and enjoy the game at your own pace, or if you want to be competitive in raids/pvp.
---
I mean I think it is fair to pay for the service they are providing. We told them we would on the petition.
---
Personally I've always had interest, just by the time I was in a place in life that I could afford the subscription, I felt it was almost pointless to hop in because I'd be so behind. The fresh start chance that Classic brings is exactly what I needed.
---
that's a good meme regardless
---
Hybrid tax, the more you can do the less effective it will be.
---
You can ret and be just fine solo and grouping while leveling.
---
Earlier dungeons you should be able to heal without speccing into holy *if you guys need a healer*
---
Have fun being op throughout leveling :)
---
I have just been reloading this sub since stress test. Blizz what have you done to me
---
"Ooooh! The little Magmadar!" lmao
---
oh no, let me visit r/classicwow where the subreddit is literally based on a game that exists because we dont like retail wow, and complain about us complaining about retail wow
---
do you see us complaining about your [D.va](https://D.va) cosplay or whatever you are probably into? no, because that's not the point of this sub. but of course we are gonna complain about retail wow, that's literally why we're here.
---
I've been a casual player since Vanilla. Never had an issue having fun or finding enjoyment in the game. I dabbled in the occasional pug raid spot without needing to be in a hardcore guild and had a blast in world pvp/bgs or just dicking around with friends I made a long the way. It depends on what you want out of the game. If you want to be decked out in beast gear then it's pretty hardcore because of the amount of time you have to put into it. If you go at your own pace you can still get some decent gear and have a lot of fun though.
---
\&gt;kids today  
---
I don't buy it. Most people pining for classic wow were kids at the time it came out and they loved it without even getting into the meat of real raiding. They like instant gratification because that's what they have been given for at least a decade. They didn't even know things could **be** a different way. I think it's also important to acknowledge that not every single person on the planet needs to play the game. It's **fine** if the game only appeals to a certain demographic or people who are at just the right time in their life to enjoy it.
---
Cloth/leather/mail/plate only affects the Armor value of an item. For the majority of players, this is pretty insignificant. Stats are king. Cloth items will make up a large portion of Shaman/Paladin/Druid raid gear. DPS Warriors will wear mostly leather gear. Etc.
---
You could be right, but there are better solutions to this.
---
I personally like the idea of layering for like the low level zones, 1-20 or something.
---
It's not only about the economy, a big part of vanilla was the community. I won't run into the same people here and there if they are switched to other layers. I like running into the same people every once in a while, just to have that moment of "Hey, I remember that guy!"
---
I'm definitely more competitive than the average player, which is why I'm even considering playing Live in the first place in order to learn the game. I'm worried I'll get immediately left in the dust by other competitive players who actually know the game, and then struggle to find good clans and all that jazz.
---
The official forums are a dark, evil place. Don't waste your time there.
---
&gt; I hope the demand from the player base for more beta invites is heard. 
---
See, that's what I think is a disconnect between players and devs: Players see a Beta invite as an invitation to *play the game*, whereas devs need people who *test* shit. So people who want in because they need their Classic fix aren't the people the devs *want* in anyhow. A bit further down, there's someone who says he's pretty much done playing the Beta because he's maxed a toon, and cannot justify playing a different one that's gonna get deleted anyhow. That's the mindset of a *player*, not a *tester*.
---
Of course, Blizzard did this to themselves by how they treat a Beta invitation as some sort of privilege - you even have to have an active sub to even having been considered as a Beta "tester", i.e. you had to give them money before they even considered you to do work for them. And you get the work ethic you pay for. So, if you let people pay for a chance to work, you'll *of course* mostly get people that won't do what you ask of them, but do what *they* want, which is get their fix and bow out.
---
Aight, rant over.
---
BFA launch where people couldn't log in for 4+ hours. Even to this day the launches are iffy.
---
I don't really know if the old one is better. Imo it looks clunky because they move faster than their movement suggest. In fact they move forward while character is almost static. As if character is floating.
---
eh, i mean, there was a few of stuff on the blizz forums back in the day trying to argue against some of the stuff. but we were heavily (and depressingly) outnumbered. i guess we really were a silent majority.
---
I see your point for sure and it's 100% in their interest in getting servers very close in faction balance considering I don't think they'll have server transfers available for classic.
---
Layering is their solution to a. Queues and b. Not having to merge servers entirely.
---
Hope they clarify if any services like transfers will be available.
---
Didn't they reroute the flight paths at some point to make them faster and have more paths between points? Maybe the remodelling took away the tilting and added the sharp turns.
---
"the book holds power beyond your comprehension... So I won't even bother explaining it"
---
Wait, I thought sharding was still in.
---
Actually the animation is correct in beta and private servers have just guessed the stealth animation wrong.
---
Ill have to look up the shadowplay thing, I am not too interested in streaming, but i'd like to be able to record cool things that happen without taking up my limited harddrive space
---
There are something like 3.5 mil lvl 120 chars. WoW is in a very bad state in terms of subs now, Classic will help bring in new and old subs, as it's a far better game for people who are looking for an RPG, and not a hack n slash type game.
---
The very first thing you'll see after an **announcement** of a content update will be renewed calls for Classic. Classic Classic WoW. Classic Classic Classic WoW. How about we play a little of the game and enjoy it before our big plans for getting into Karazhan.
---
EQ2 did it better at the same time. You could jump off of the ride whenever you wanted. The only downside was that you were playing Everquest 2.
---
This is how the War of the Three Hammers originally started :P
---
I know people who like aspects of retail and aspects of classic, it must suck to exist to complain. I'm sorry you have that outlook on this subject, you have my pity.
---
I agree with the first part but it's hard to reference a 15 year old game that's we as a general public only have access to with a private server.
---
Do you consider things taking much longer counts as them being more difficult, because Classic is definitely a lot less streamlined and requires a lot of time investment but I wouldn't call most of the content harder
---
They have said they would allow server transfers in one of the interview floating around. Personally though I think server transfers are a mistake because of what it means for ninja looters, but I see why they want it implemented.
---
The fact that they have a working client from vanilla and you don't.
---
The fact that actual screenshots from vanilla retail servers have proven the size to be the same but screenshots from private servers are different.
---
You just want to be mad at blizzard about yet another thing, hate has blinded you.
---
Lionheart Helm is BoE. So you really don't need to go taht route to get it. If you want to make and sell them, though, go for it.
---
So instead of a Blizzcon demo where s whole bunch of stuff, including animations was off, do we have Beta footage?
---
Cross realm BGs were brought in for a reason, and so were the corresponding battlegroups. They were intended to fix queue times on low population servers as well as servers with huge faction imbalances that left one faction with huge queues because there weren't enough of the other faction to keep games going.
---
Look, I'm not a fan of CRBGs, either, but they existed for good reason.
---
It's disappointing to be indiscriminately thrown into a pool of cross-realm strangers and there are probably more elegant, appropriate ways to compromise on this, but they were a solution to dead BG queues and allowed people to actually do this content again.
---
Well then for sure wait on it - and one of the most appealing things about classic for me is the fact that (at least for now) we won't be forced to move to TBC which let's us stay in that Vanilla experience for as long or as little as we like.
---
And yeah fresh launch for wow is the pinnacle of mmorpgs for me - resource wars and plenty of strangers to befriend.
---
get on my level bro

*Stares at the tiny wolves in Northshire Abbey on live*
---
&gt; Not for long.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Well, actually, since retail and classing subscriptions are linked, I have a feeling blizzard will lump all the numbers together to look better. Go check any day on Twitch though.. Classic is getting noticeably more attention and hype than BFA ever came close to.
---
This is getting out of hand really. I'm certain they will not report their official sub numbers even if classic breaks the glass ceiling. Onto the other part, retail right now is inbetween 8.1 and 8.2, there's nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing really worth watching. Classic is in the hype state right now, especially since the beta is very limited, so people who want some "closure" actually go and watch streamers play it, because they can't, if you want to, you can go play BFA right now, there's nothing holding you back. Also these numbers are not insane. I remember similar numbers during expansion launch or during the Uldir/BoD mythic race.
---
Back then people were measuring days at single digits to get level 60 quickly.
---
At the time I was playing FFXI and I think I had over 100 days played and I wasn't max level yet.
---
And in FFXI you lost xp when you died, so you could de-level.
---
While we're talking about non-casual games...
---
By original you mean pserver, yes? Their values are guessed for pretty much everything.
---
Also, as a rogue player I prefer the second one, the first one looks buggy.
---
I loved hunters in classic, pets really felt unique and they were very efficient farmers.
---
*I said you can't sit with us!*
---
According to wiki, the actual definition is "a word of Scots origin to mean a magical spell of any kind, or one which reads the same forwards and backwards. It can also be a witch's trick, or a sham. It is possibly derived from the Gaelic canntaireachd, a piper's mnemonic chant."
---
Understandable why it's used in so many games, and specifically as a simple free spell in D&amp;D. It can easily be interpreted as "basic spell trick." Never bothered to look up the definition before, but have played a little bit of D&amp;D where it was used.
---
And blizz sending beta invites to people like this. Great thinking Blizzard...🤦‍♂️
---
&gt; Blizzard will be monitoring for this sort of thing.
---
I hope they will, I really do. I'm not trying to have any arguments here. I just want that classic experience. I want myself and others to feel that rush again. I also want new people who haven't played to enjoy it as well. It's more worry than anything.
---
&gt;  Layering isn’t sharding. Even if it was there’s plenty of worse things that Blizzard has done to the game, even in terms of server community, than sharding. 
---
This here we'll just have to disagree on. I hated sharding and still do. I realize it's not layering, but I just want communication on what they plan to do to shape it into something that will help us instead of cause issues.
---
What? I’m pretty sure in Vanilla Alliance had more players
---
They made the change in patch 6.1; to allow players to be able to fly across the continent, using flight paths that they don’t have registered yet (so you could take direct routes, not roundabouts).
---
There was something else about dismounting early, but I didn’t play the game during warlords of draenor
---
I'm pretty sure 15 minute queues weren't a problem. It was 45+ minute queues that prompted this addition.
---
Gotcha. So let's close the beta. They have a client right?
---
It's part of the GeForce experience program if you have a Nvidia graphics card.
---
Fuuuuck yes, I remember doing this too. You actually had to figure out a rotation while leveling and be mindful about overpulling.
---
MMORPG'S went to hell the moment developers decided to turn it in a casual experience so they could cater to a broader audience. 
---
Another thing that destroyed WoW was cross-realm Technologies, sharding and automated groupfinding tools. Taking away server identity and sense of community. 
---
One of the biggest joys I hear people mention is the need to group up and to recognize someone 20 lvls later when you group up again. This is how lasting friendships are created and this is the reason we want to login every day. This sense of community and building a reputation. Being recognized.
---
BFA is a empty shell. It might as well have been a totally different game. One not worthy of mention.
---
That person can stay where they are in World of Wardrobecraft.
---
Maybe more characters made or right before tbc but overall horde were overpopulated.
---
It's why alliance had near instant bg queues and horde gas to wait.
---
At lower levels I agree with the ganking.  At max level with seduce it’s not to much of a issue.
---
That's not the nature of videogame development. You're describing currently accepted trends.
---
No, but the issue has been reported (normal question when you have a doubt about a certain aspect), blizzard addressed the issue (by verifying with their original client), case closed.
---
naked banks are the one true way
---
Wtf? Bring the old one back! And yes, the one shown on the private server is the correct one. See world of roguecraft 1 for reference https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw
---
Not quite comparable. The difficulty curve is significantly altered withLFR to account for random idiots who can't follow simple instructions running the content they aren't geared or specced for.
---
I do think the argument for group finder is valid, though. Faster groups, especially if you can peruse cross-realm players looking to do the same content.
---
I don't think people appreciate how hard and essential "hight dps uptime" is! Knowing when you can engage after a pause (like the tankswap on rag). Our best rogue rolled his (barely) pre-bis mage for rag and simply by knowing the fight the best, whas the best mage in the raid.
---
Unless you're a Warrior.
---
Don't sweat having a newborn. The first 8 months are a breeze. You'll get plenty of game time since they sleep so much.
---
Or, you know, it feels like an rpg where you start very weak and watch your character progress instead of the instant gratification theme park that live is currently
---
I hope this isn't the case but if it is I hope we can send them all packing to BFA before they re-ruin classic with their whining.
---
If I believed he would simply not play, I'd be okay with it. But this strikes me as the kind of player that'll play the game anyway and just frequently spam about how much it sucks, but still refuse to stop.
---
Lmao you are seriously underestimating how much of the current wow viewership is classic if you think it’ll drop that much by being split. Now bfa that’s another story..
---
&gt; Bottom line is Classic is giving WoW aka Blizzard the most viewership its had in a long while even surpassing BfA beta, BfA launch and even their eSports efforts across every IP.
---
I mean, that's just false mate, but no need to worry, you can lie blatantly on this sub and people will eat it up if it supports their classic is for the 5Heads argument ...
---
If you're interested, you can check twitch statistics https://sullygnome.com/game/World_of_Warcraft for yourself.
---
Well, DPS and tank, 2 options. Druid can technically ranged DPS, melee DPs, heal and tank.
---
Eh, they owe investors a successful game with lasting subscribers, If people quit within the first few months it's going to be a major loss for them.
---
I sincerely hope Blizzard gets it right and wish them the best. I am not a fan of BFA at all.
---
A hunter can resist hamstring with the surv tree talents.
---
I never really got into raiding, so tailoring definitely felt like a great profession. There were a couple of high-end patterns that were both difficult to farm the mats for and good upgrades for me.
---
Selling bags was also a nice way to get a bit of gold, although I never did get enough for an epic mount. There were always too many other things that I spent my gold on.
---
Fishing also felt more meaningful. It took a long time, but finishing Nat Pagle's quest and getting the fishing rod was quite an achievement.
---
This video was just more covenient for demonstration purposes. It's the new animation in the beta as well.
---
I think I’m going to do the exact same thing with my hunter main and lock “alt.” Hunters are just flat out so much fun to play at all levels, but getting left behind in raids is heart breaking
---
Nope, my alt is level 1. Full tux.
---
My god the difference is stunning. Hope they'll be ble to fix this.
---
Gank and grief
---
If u lvl with a gathering, you can just bank everythingfor later.
---
Uh, no. Your server must have been dead or something if you felt getting in at the start was the only way to progress your character without "getting carried"
---
I also hate sharding, I want to be clear on that, but there’s far worse things like cross realm grouping, LFD/LFR, and name change services that have impacted the server communities far more.
---
I know this feel ! cant wait for classic I also had a NightElf Rogue But i Had Bloodfang with Deathdealers Helm and Shoulders. It looked so bad ass I was on the mannoroth Realm
---
A lot of people think level 30 or around that will be the point where most people will be quitting if the game isn't meant for them, as the grind can get real at that point. I don't mind, I want everyone to try it at least.
---
I don't know who that is. But I'm not gonna look him up just to agree or disagree with you. If you don't like a streamer, don't watch them. We don't need to call people neckbeards because they do things differently than us. Some people devote their lives to much stranger things than WoW.

The memories!

I get what you are saying but you seem to conveniently pick thing to make it seem worse, so I'm going to play the devil's advocate.
---
&gt; even worse when combined with HP and SL/SL.
---
SL SL is not directly related to resilience is it? You seem to have something against that spec meanwhile it's not even in the top 3 of the most represented classes in top tanked TBC pvp.
---
&gt;2,5k hp difference whereas a good shatter can do around that in dmg or in atleast 3 globals if lucky, even with starter gear. 
---
A frostmage is not the most known thing to oneshot you. A warrior can easily do that... Hell even rets. In TBC it's borderline impossible.
---
&gt;Full S4 BiS Dude with 14k+ hp. 450 resilience makes sure that you don't crit.
---
First of all, 14k+ go with 450 resil is not common at all, and it's mainly achieved by warlocks only. And if you go that route, the damage you deal will be very shitty. 
---
Second, 450 resil makes sure you don't get shattered critter? No. It's like -22% crit chance, the mage will still have 50+% chance to crit on shatter. With fresh gear.
---
&gt;A well put shatter in BC deals around 3k dmg without gear, if double crit.
---
It's more. Without even correcting your numbers, you flat out forgot your elemental crit. It's a bad way to compare anyways because of the lack of context (added spells, like the extra freeze which makes up for the lost dmg on 1 freeze etc).
---
&gt;Autohitting would most likely be enough to win, the lowgear 70 would go oom or die to white hits before he could kill the fullgear s4 70.
---
I won't even bother to comment, we both know it's not true.
---
&gt;in Classic skill matters more than in BC. from a PvP standpoint only, Classic is the far "better" version objectively
---
 Just because you say objectively doesn't actually make it objective. Try and kill a geared mage with a fresh warrior in vanilla. Skill to gear up and achieve top ranks in TBC is much more required than achieving top ranks in vanilla where you can basically be a backpedaling keyboardturner, but still get it if you spend enough time in BGs. For me that's not skill. It's also more rng based, which is again, not skill. 
---
I love classic pvp but achieving ranks and gear are not skill based compared to arenas. Maybe if you talk about world pvp 1on1. But all in all, TBC continues the rock paper scissors balance of vanilla, more or less regardless of gear.
---
This is your opinion, but the reality is actually that plenty of guilds in retail have now issues filling their raid roster, despite your "vastly better designed" and "challenging raids".
---
And Classic is not even out yet.
---
Problem is that live is shrinking since MoP...and BfA is basically hovering under 2 million subs, with probably less than 800k active players.
---
Once Classic hits, BfA active player base will shrink even more. It's how things work, whether you like it, or not, or you believe it, or not.
---
My opinion is not based on my personal view on the game, it's simply based on human reaction when facing 2 options.
---
Most will choose the better option...and the better option is not fancy graphics and insta-queues, gold and item showering...is the other one.
---
Most players in BfA now are running t-mog runs, do pet battles and LFR, with the IEs and WFs sprinkled in between. They simply don't have OTHER option...yet.
---
But they will have it, and the natural reaction will see Classic absolutely dwarf live in terms of active players (since both games have same sub).
---
Back in vanilla my friends never understood my obsession with fishing but some were valuable and I found it soothing
---
Which still means they have precisely 0 incentive to split them up.
---
There is nothing to gain for ATVI by splitting up the games on twitch.
---
Play! Because I will find you. I will gank you. Likely in Stranglethorn Vale. :)
---
Hope you like casting your best spell, Innervate, on a priest during raids. And don’t even forget about your other specs. All you will be casting in raids is Rank 5 Healing Touch for four hours. Classic is trash compared to today
---
Lol I actually thought that was a really good picture for a picture of a monitor. I was drunk and bored. Just wanted to share!
---
Its getting 10x more viewers because its new (you know what I mean). 
---
Once the game releases, we'll see 10 months down the road viewer count for classic.
---
So then you were too close.
---
10% of the BfA player base raids mythic. And this is what will be left by year's end : 10%, maybe 10% more of the casuals.
---
I know right. A lot of the replies in this very thread are pretty suspicious as well, the ones trying to seem reasonable and balanced. "Not everyone liked vanilla back in the day". Hmmm. I don't know. What I seem to remember is WoW growing quickly to 8 million subs during vanilla and almost everyone gamer I knew IRL playing it and only it. Unless they were on FP then you alt-tab to CS 1.6. That's what I remember. Don't know where some of these other people are getting their stories from.
---
Yeah the whole toggle issue alone is sufficient reason to scrap the idea.
---
I'd be thrilled if they found a way to make it work later on, or some other solution (like an optional patch download), but that's a low priority problem to tinker away at when there's time, not devote an art team to right now.
---
Then you had a good experience, but I've definetly met a lot of toxic people from Classic to Wrath from all walks of life and playing all classes.
---
Classic was more social for sure, but it also had its bad seeds.
---
The only cantrip I can think of that does 1d10 at level 1 is Eldritch Blast, which is kind of the warlock unique spell and still requires a successful ranged attack. Cantrips are definitely a lot more relevant at higher levels in 5e though.
---
So there's a few things to this. Difficulty of the actual encounters comes in spikes, so when you get a spike, that's when you'll see if your raiders are good or not. There's very few if any spikes in MC, which means that basically anyone can do it, especially if by "it", you mean range dps. 
---
Anyway, there's a few things that make you good, aside from the actual handling of the fights themselves. 
---
Only thing I'll name here is the ability to not stand in the bad. It applies a lot more to melee than to ranged, though it isn't quite TBC levels where it actually makes melee dps downright bad because of it. People who have the micromanagement ability to not stand in shit that will kill them are better than people who don't have that.
---
Good raiders are also able to not create drama. Obviously a big part of this is raid-leading, but there's a bunch of people who just spawn drama wherever they go, don't be one of those, cause either you will get kicked, or your guild will lose raiders because of it. Classic is a social MMO, and as such your guild's long-term social cohesion is the greatest single barrier to long-term raid success.
---
That said you also need to not be a total scrub. But like, try to read a guide for your class/spec and do what it says. That's the only relevant level to which performance is necessary. Unless you're tanking, then you need to actually be good and practice. Frostbolt spam is indeed pretty braindead, although there are some tricks like downranking that'll increase your dps.
---
The final thing you need is a big category that's called Be Prepared. There's several subsections to this bit, and what makes a good raider is trying to live up to all of them.
---
\-Study up on the fights beforehand. Make sure you watch a video of the fight, and have a clear idea of what's going down and what your job is going to be. Don't just watch a video, read a thing about it as well, the videos usually leave out details. Have a notepad document where you write down what you should know about each boss encounter, and don't be afraid to ask questions if it looks like the raid is doing things in a way you didn't know about. If you spend 1-2 hours of research for each raid (except onyxia, there's only 1 fight there) then you should expect to spend 10 hours tops on research over the lifetime of vanilla. Vanilla doesn't have many mechanics, but it does have a few, and people who don't know about them can't do them.
---
\-Show up with all your gear repaired. This will ensure that everyone's gear breaks roughly at the same time if you have a wipe-heavy raid.
---
\-Show up having farmed out all the consumeable you will need. Bare minimum effort is bringing your own buff food and water and farming the Elemental Whatever necessary for a guildie alchemist to turn them into Greater Whatever Protection Potions, but I'd say everyone should bring enough 1hour buff consumables to keep themselves buffed for every boss including wipes. You can go above and beyond on this, and it's nice when people do so. For Flasks, I don't think a good raider neccesarily need to bring those at all.
---
\-If you're going to do world buffs, those should be picked up in a the last play session you have before raid time. Log out so the buff timers don't tick down.
---
\-Be logged out in the appropriate place before raid start. If you're getting Onyxia's head world buff as a group, that means orgrimmar or stormwind. Otherwise it means outside the raid.
---
\-Log in on time. 
---
Any raider that does these things will have the status of "good raider", although past ony/MC, they might have to learn stuff and be skilled in something like the actual gameplay sense. I believe there was a post about Vael earlier: in that fight you get to see if your fury warriors are good at tanking, for instance, and that's always spicey.
---
Please dont comment if you're unable to read. 
---
"IT MAKES YOU ***THINK*** LAYERING/PHASING IS AFFECTING WSG"
---
We can definitely agree that those were the problem as well. I'm not in the "No Changes" group. I realize that a few small things have to change. I just don't want them to go overboard.
---
39 warlock in PvP was just disgusting fun.
---
[This is the best I could do](https://vilewow.com/t/old-screenshots/543).  I started playing on Burning Legion just a month before TBC came out so I don't have any of my own screenshots.  However, my husband did play during Vanilla on Burning Legion.  He still has the old guild website up and running with some posts going back to 2006.  Maybe you'll see some names you recognize.
---
The overall issue are the younger gamers today. In a world where pretty much all entertainment is instant there is no sense of working toward something or investing any meaningful amount of time for a reward.
---
Fast paced shooters and MOBAs clearly backup that point. As a long time DOTA2 player I can attest to that communities entitlement. It a game lasts longer than 30 minutes people start freaking out or will even throw the game just to end it. While I'm sitting there having a blast in the back and forth games that go over an hour (longest match was like an hour and 20 minutes). 
---
Years ago I'd spend countless hours farming in Diablo 2 for a single gear upgrade or a rune to drop.
---
Today I can start a level 1 Seasonal character, have someone powerlevel me through some rifts, hit 70 in a half hour, go complete a handful of objectives for earn a gear set, and within an hour or so I'm running low to mid level torrent rifts.
---
The majority of the gaming community just doesn't invest time into games like we remember. Yes they may rack up /hours played, but they want rewards to come quick, they don't want to invest time towards a reward.
---
The circlejerk is strong on this subreddit
---
That's true, and it's the reason people think "MMO's are dying". I guess developers are too scared to make an actual game, rather than approach the "entitled" part of gamers. That part of gamers cannot sustain itself, since the lack of commitment in any product pretty much doesn't allow longevity. And without longevity, you can't have a "true" MMO, only some sort of single player with occasional grouping abomination.
---
An area to layer hop near the new character spawn point. An area to layer hop in each capital. A cool down of 30+ minutes between hops. To my mind, this should largely prevent exploits.
---
Would it make it awkward to join your friends, group - sure.
---
Right there with you buddy.  The beta has been the first time in literal years I’ve felt excited to log in and play a character outside of raiding.  Can’t wait for classic to go live.
---
Yeah, he used to be a boring level 1 priest. Then in tbc I made him into a gentlemen.
---
That's kinda the problem most people have with retail. It does so much, that the player doesnt really need to do anything, removing all challenge and depth.
---
Wanna go through a dungeon or raid? Retail wow has you covered, just click a few buttons and youre off with a prenade group you bever need to speak to or hear from. And you don't even need to find the entrance, we'll teleport you inside.
---
Can't decide what gear to wear? Dont worry, retail has standardized all gear so you just need to pay attention to a single number (ilvl) to know whats best.
---
Not sure how the combat system works and afraid of dying? No problem, retail wow has removed all challenge from the leveling ecperience. The only time you'll ever die before hitting max level is when you derp your dumb ass off the elevators in Thunderbluff. 
---
We also locked certain spells and abilities to different specs instead of just giving you accesss to all of them, so you wont have to make any considerations or choices about which abilities to use. 
---
All you have to do is show up and well hand you everything on a silver platter. No need to work hard, invest time or... think for that matter. 
---
And if you REALLY just can't manage going through the leveling experience which has become so incredibly tedious and boring thanks to all the "improvements" weve made, then just give us some money and well let you skip the whole thing.
---
Also I know it wasn't specifically the question, but so much of the graphical debate revolves around an *optional* choice that I thought it was worth bringing up as "optional" is usually the context behind these discussions (but not always, there's always 'that guy' that wants vanilla graphics just gone).
---
Back when Staysafe and Sonii had a 40 v 40, a few days ago
---
Blizzard gave horde blood elves to try and even out the numbers though?
---
I never had fast queues as alliance in vanilla (EU magtheridon)
---
I never said i wanted them split, chill
---
thats a bad angle ...still i go for the troll . the other one looks like she streams on just chatting section
---
&gt; In my opinion vanilla doesn't enforce group leveling as well as older MMO games.
---
this to me was an issue with FF11 and everquest had that WoW classic resolved perfectly with how they did leveling. as both examples required you past the starting zone to group up or get destoryed it dumped you into the deep end and saying "you must group up!" rather than "you know grouping up would be much better".
---
so in classic you get this natural experiance somewhere around 7-20 where you on your own get that grouping up is a much better experiance. and while you might know grouping up is better you might not have the time and classic dosen't let that stop you from playing or demanding your time inorder to effectivly play. this lets you creep up to max level eventually. it was a the time considered a casual thing but it was a good casual change.
---
&gt;So you admit the fun doesn't come from the combat when leveling.
---
in the fun in classic comes in the form of cycles. at the start the combat is indeed fun as it is new and changing all the time and you are improving. then you experiance your first group experiance and that starts it's own cycle of fun. then you might do a dungeon and you get to experiance the cycle of fun that is tanking, healing or learning how to perfect your dps rotation. then the next cycle is getting to X level for a talent skill that makes you feel awsomly strong. all aspects is having fun with the combat in new ways that naturally flows from one to the other. untill you reach max level.
---
however the combat itself is rather dry without the cycle of new.
---
Yep. The challenge of mobs being a threat is part of what I miss about vanilla. I don’t like plowing everything in 3 hits in white gear...
---
2 definitely made it easier to afk while traversing a continent.
---
It apparently became a thing when you got the button to get off the flight path in WoD. They did some lazy coding and dropped all of these animations because they'd have to redo them for every flight path.
---
I haven't found anything and I've tried for hours
---
The time and effort is to test, re-test, and test again for bugs. Do each starting zone three times, look for discrepancies, try to find errors. Crawl entire zones and looks for things that are working as intended. That’s why there is a beta. People are just using it to garner twitch subs, not to actually test the game. It’s one of the reasons this Beta hasn’t done much of anything that it’s supposed to; and the Not A Bug thread is a shining example of it.
---
Hi, /u/sadtimes12
---
This really shouldn’t come as a surprise if you’ve done your research or followed the discussion on here for the last few months. Druids are considered the best FC. Outside of that they don’t have much a role in organised pvp. Fun at being hard to kill and running away in wpvp, but actual bgs are about killing things or being a strong support class and Druid is neither.
---
You do realise RPG is an acronym for Role Playing Game? BFA is more RPG than WoW has probably ever been, storytelling is a lot better than it ever was, maybe except Legion.
---
What you probably meant to say was MMO ...
---
I literally log in back in a day on Argus days of Legion as an elemental shaman, have been running around completing my daily grind and was bored to hell with my fancy spell rotations, legendary items spell modifiers, variety of mobs with HD animations and effects. When I was done with this nonsense I log in on a vanilla private server and continued lvling my lvl 7 shaman with only a few spells and enjoyed it 10 times more than what I was doing on retail.
---
and Gnomish Mind Control Cap and Gnomish Net-o-Matic... and I'm a Noggenfogger fiend so Gadgetzan teleporter is a huge plus.
---
I'm team Gnomish Engi, but I know Goblin has some cool stuff too.

---
They dont have a regular resurrect only a battle rez so in 5 mans everyone always has to run back.
---
Hey at least they were civil about it. no bashing, just "didn't like it"
---
Like a lot of you, I’ve had a sub since 2005. I’m fucking PISSED that I can’t at least get a 1 week beta or something. It’s just disrespectful IMO. No skin off their backs to provide beta servers to subscribers, especially those paying for retail and don’t even play it because it sucks.
---
Even asmongold said he wants a hard reset on WoW. He has more achievements and mounts than anyone I know. So not everyone wants to keep their shit. I’ve had the same account since vanilla day 1 and I am entirely on board with wiping everything. I LIVE for fresh starts.
---
Not mystery but the difficulty, it would be closer to what you remember/experienced if it is overtuned
---
You downvoting me
---
Sap, blind, vanish, gouge etc.
---
Haters make me famous
---
Same. Legion was so good. Legendaries were kind of brutal in their significance, but it was so goddamn fun.
---
Not necessarily on my server. There was a group of warlocks who would do the runs for free so you didn't have to buy all the mats. I remember getting mine only for ~300g.
---
check vanillafriends.com
---
I lol'd
---
same modern wow wrong animation in the beta as well.
---
Yes, that's the entrance and exit of Naxx.
---
Yep, it's a beautiful thing but it will cost you a lot of mana. Bring mana pots or in some builds you can spec into Master Shapeshifter to help.
---
I lost more than one wizard being sucked to death by a fucking Stirge.
---
Classic is highly comparable to dnd l. Just look at the spell names and effects. Also the dungeon design idea is to be seen in here with their take on bosses etc. It's great.
---
Until you die from the dots lol
---
Who are you, though?
---
wrong, look at literally any pvp movie from original 2004-2007 vanilla...
---
They had to do something to not have people sit in 6 hour queues and layering is their only real option. 
---
Would like to see some restrictions in layer hopping though.
---
If there is one farm unseen for the first couple of days or weeks that could be done in the shadows - it for sure impacts the economy which would blow chunks.
---
That being said I'm pretty sure most people care more about not EVER seeing another character disappear in front of our eyes while questing.
---
Friend or for that should never happen... if it does classic blows fat chunks until layering is taken out.
---
Does it break the game? No. Does it make classic like BFA? Yep.
---
Its fun. Its also a big event for most WoW players and they want to be a part of it. Are you a robot, do you not understand that or are you just playing dumb?
---
you can go back at any time and still get 100% reputation value from the grey starting quests
---
&gt;The only downside I think that exists for AoE grinding is that at level 60 you will need to respec your tree (this is expensive) because it will be garbage for anything other than AoE grinding.  
---
You’ve missed the tiny little downside that it’ll be impossible for anyone but the top 5 levellers on the server for 4 months after launch because every zone will be hugely populated.
---
Some regeants might be cheaper for resist consumables. Before raids really pop
---
That sounds amazing, what was the name of the add-on?
---
I have not played WoW since wotlk so no I haven't. But I do know that 5 noobs can AFK through a Sargeras raid, that I do know. And I know that simply offering an option to whack up the difficulty is a cop-out. They could easily just double KT's health and make C'Thun ressurect a bunch of times before actually dying and call it "mythic". There ya go now it's harder on vanilla.
---
Are they though? From what we've seen of every newer mmo release, including those aiming to be more like vanilla in terms of progression/attunement etc (wildstar) people just... werent.
---
Imo people have moved on. Until we see something hugely revolutionary MMO is in the same vein as RTS - just not what people currently want or are interested in.
---
Time will tell, and I think WoW Classic will be popular - but it won't be anything like the sub numbers and growth that it had originally.
---
It's quite literally a different decade and a different era for gaming.

I am certain they will add more people to the beta in a few weeks time. 
---
We waited 14 years to return. Is it really so hard to wait a few months more? 
---
Yes..I to want to be in the beta and participate in testing just like I did back in the early days but I don' t go on a salty rampage. People take everything for granted these days. The entitled generation is real.
---
They did, not sure what hes talking about
---
You get shards from using drain soul on a mob that would have given you XP or honor. At level 60, it simply means any mob that's green or higher to you.

Gnomish MC Cap, the most important one!

Did you like Legion!? Well come on down to BFA emporium where we have Legion: Less Features Boring Lore Edition!
---
lmao u think 5 shamans is op?

Try 5 hunters.
---
5 fucking pets, 5 tank pets, 5 hunters, 5 huge low lvl dps.
---
its so stupid.
---
You seem upset. Chill out dude.
---
OSRS had its own section for a while and was never used until the top streamers decided to all shift over at once.
---
Yes. 
---
There are many reasons to ply but I recommend taking your time and enjoy everything. The world is absolutely massive and there is so much to do/explore. The main issue is the time commitment to level but just go into it realizing that it is going to take at least a couple weeks of game time to hit max level. 
---
Ask for help, be nice and enjoy it. I wish I could be in your position because the game was absolutely jaw dropping when I first played. 
---
You might want to level on a PvE server because not knowing what you’re doing and where you’re going will be pretty tough on it’s own. When you add in players of the opposing faction killing and camping you, will be infuriating and might turn you off from wanting to continue leveling.
---
I was on Skullcrusher Alliance, the Alliance guild Immortality, on my stever had a world first Thunderfury Warrior and it was a High population.

That's why I'm playing a pally

Don't pity me, I join communities I like to engage with people with similar interests.

You are the true hero sir!
---
Engineering was the "fun" profession because it had some cool unique items, but there's always a need for enchanters and alchemists. For the most part every profession had something, especially for lowbies. Stuff like Black Mageweave was BiS for casters for a lot of levels, so there's always the demand for that kind of stuff.
---
You don't have to do this. You can level up in whatever zone you'd like, the grey starting quests will still give you 100% reputation value later on. But as someone else noted, you still need tons of runecloth after you've completed most of the rep giving quests. I did this as a Dwarf to finally get rid of that hideous beast I was riding... Only downside to being a Dwarf xD

It depends on what you're fighting I guess. If your GM is big into kobolds and goblins, I can see that you'd probably miss a bunch of those. My GM almost always had us fight humans and stuff at the low levels, so for me touch attacks were actually really consistent in hitting.
---
More consistent than fighters using weapons, in fact.
---
Druids keep damage from getting too spikey
---
Numbers on private server are guesswork, not animations.
---
Pretty sure it will happen alot, like it's the easiest way out of a gank. Just ask to get into a friends group and poof you are on a another layer. And the ganker will get fked over
---
They're guessing an animation? Lol
---
Believe, i preffer this over not getting it. But they have made other quality of life changes. This one would have been good
---
WoW classic is honestly better for casuals than hardcore players.
---
You will have fresh new content for months, maybe even a year. Hardcore players will be repeating the content in all phases several times over. 
---
WoW never demanded no-lifing. Raiding is not for the kind of casual who can't ever set aside a few hours once in a while though.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, this was mentioned by the devs during the interview with Esfand.
---
They basically said that, in vanilla, you could basically force that behavior by logging out mid-flight, so they figured just adding the button would be a better way to provide that capability.
---
When people say this I presume they mean that boss fights in WoW have become like God of War or whatever where there are different mechanics you have to engage with during the battle. That, to me, does not indicate higher difficulty, just a further straying from RPG/D&amp;D mechanics.
---
That's not how google works mate, it's more complicated than that
---
"wow bfa" includes every search terms about battle for azeroth, it is the exact same if you type battle for azeroth or whatever you want [https://i.gyazo.com/ec034e8f3d3c08be5551cbcae85b96ec.png](https://i.gyazo.com/ec034e8f3d3c08be5551cbcae85b96ec.png)
---
And by the way even if you don't type that, the percentage of people who do won't change so it's representative
---
Personally, I just want Vanilla (or at least as close to it as possible). I couldn't care less if there are *optional* stuff as long as I can get the original look.
---
It's just that Vanilla and current are quite different even under the hood. It's really not just adding all the current art assets and putting in a button to toggle it. It's a *lot* of work. Work which should be first and foremost put to bringing back the original game before thinking about any optional "improvements". There are *still* quite a few bugs and differences from the Vanilla look (differences which currently cannot be toggled).
---
For example, in the current Classic build the glow is too strong. I'm sure Blizzard changed it sometime after Vanilla. Unfortunately most people don't notice or mind so I think it'll not be reverted. (Or people just tell you to disable it entirely but you could do that in Vanilla too and it's not the same. I like the glow in Vanilla but in Classic it's overblown.)

My two favorite classes. It’s going to be fun destroying people on a suboptimal class that’s 15 years old
---
Blizz never confirmed it, but literally everyone in beta who wasn't specifically flagged has played since 2004-2006 according to people asking their guilds in beta.
---
It's almost like you didn't even look at the fucking post. He's pointing out that in Vanilla, flight paths looked different (better) than they do today, and that Blizzard should reimplement it for Classic because that's how it was. To remain true to the original.. aka "\#NoChanges"
---
Maybe read/watch before commenting next time.

Pumped for Classic.

&gt; It's ironic, I suppose, that she finds retail WoW to be boring 
---
This is a really weird thing for me to just zero in on like this but how is this ironic?
---
Anyway, as already mentioned you're overthinking this. Really only one thing stands out that should be considered. If she wants to tank end-game she might want to look at her realistic options as a druid tank vs rolling warrior instead. If you do decide to roll another healer instead I'd go with shaman for ghost wolf as she will have travel form.
---
But so far your plan to level tank+heals is fine. You could both level DPS and still tank/heal sufficiently even in dungeons to level.
---
Someone should tell him loose != lose.
---
I figured it was more to do with the devs just recording them flying from one place to another in vanilla rather than having a rail of sorts in place.
---
Alliance was always the bigger pop. Servers vary of course
---
Well if you are paying them for goods and services you are usually entitled to some kind of return.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect quality.
---
If you value that more than experiencing the game for the first time on a retail Blizzard server then you've got 3 months to learn the game on a vanilla private server.
---
And I think the "only for phase 1" is unacceptable for that reason - sadly with 3 months to go I doubt there will be any changes - we'll just get the generic "we are listening to community feedback and are looking into how we can improve layering for launch"
---
I've thought the game's sucked since the middle of WotLK. I've tried several expansions that came out after that but I hated them all.
---
dude they went about to create bugs and performance limitations and people complained about the item sharing as well, so just accept it xD
---
Weapons can be swapped in combat.
---
If you want real talk, I'd honestly put Heroic difficulty and perhaps even Normal ahead of vanilla - at least in design if not difficulty too.
---
Even in Naxx the challenge is in having that many people with geared characters and farmed consumables and not the content itself.
---
Also, do you have a citation for your 10%? Perhaps it shows numbers for Heroic/Normal too. These are relevant because they engage different parts of the player base.
---
According to wowprogress 40% of tracked guilds have killed Heroic Jaina currently. 
---
You can argue regarding how at this point you are very heavily aided by gear fighting heroic jaina, and the plethora of nerfs to her by now. 
---
BUT even in the current state the boss design is far more complex, and the difficulty is higher. 
---
Obviously heavily outgearing can skew that. But that's a symptom of how BoD tier is essentially over at this point and we're waiting on the new raid in 8.2.
---
The intermediary 2 boss raid CoS has 63%/47% heroic clear rate so far.
---
I would drink her bathwater.
---
Don’t tell me About it. I’ll play war...
---
that's not how google trend works, type whatever about wow/bfa you want and you will have the same result because it includes everything related to BFA
---
Lol so you know the struggle.
---
I think this comment sums up pretty well why people are fed up with Live. Live offers an ocean of content that's a puddle deep, it's impressive to see but there's not really much there. Classic is like the community swimming pool, it ain't much but all your friends are there and there's a diving board, and if you don't want to swim there's a lawn and picnic tables.
---
I press F for you my friend.  I remember the first time I was introduced to those.
---
yes :(
---
Any particular servers you’d recommend? Or is that all hush-hush
---
All the online polls, even official blizzard ones, heavily favor horde, so while it won't be quite as stark it still is looking like horde will outnumber alliance this time around.
---
ZALGO. HE COMES.
---
*"bUt aGgRo mAnAgEmEnT Is a cHaLlEnGiNg mEcHaNiC"*
---
Hijacking this to ask: If you were a Prot Warrior who wants to MT raids, what's the profession you'd pick?
---
I'm on the fence between Mining+Blacksmithing to make some neat recipes, and Mining+Engineering for the benefit of gadgets, bombs and other knick knacks.
---
They really need to play longer than the starting area. Tbh mages have it pretty easy as far as qol is concerned in vanilla.
---
AS others have already said, bag space is a problem. There's a talent in the affliction tree which causes you to get mana regen at 100% for 10 seconds even though you're within the 5 second rule if you kill a mob while drain soul is on it. This puts a definite premium on using drain soul as the last spell when killing mobs. And also causes you to create a soul shard... Which goes in your bags... Which fill up rapidly.
---
A common solution to this little problem is to get a soul bag which will be the first place that newly generated soul shards go to and replace your drain soul action button with a macro that deletes any soul shard in the last space of your soul bag and then casts drain soul. That way you keep a nice full bag of soul shards and don't have them fill up the rest of the space in the rest of your bags.
---
I’d rather they have no changes. Like part of the appeal for me is lack of modern QoL additions.
---
It was a joke :)
---
Im at old Daoc vet so im not unfamiliar with an old school grind lol
---
You should be able to. I recall poisoning 3 weapons, but it has been over a decade. I may be mistaken.
---
I'd be able to take you more seriously if you attempted to talk like an adult and actually make points that could be discussed/rebutted.
---
&gt;But I do know that 5 noobs can AFK through a Sargeras raid, 
---
Makes no sense.
---
&gt;And I know that simply offering an option to whack up the difficulty is a cop-out.
---
&gt;They could easily just double KT's health and make C'Thun ressurect a bunch of times before actually dying and call it "mythic". 
---
The WoW difficulty tiers for raids aren't just HP increases. They include completely new mechanics, spells, and additions to the fights.
---
They are in essence generally very different fights.
---
So no, it isn't the same at all.
---
And the fact you don't know that makes you seem very ignorant / the fact you choose to ignore that despite knowing it makes you lose all credibility.
---
Noob. Did not even have a wand.
---
Let’s get the game first. THEN worry about non inconsequential things like this and moonwalking .... sound good?
---
I wasn't asking if I was a snowflake. I was trying to start a conversation on my favorite sub. Why do you have to be so negative about it?
---
Clearly! At least you have pvp abilities at low level!
---
The quicker you make it to 60 the quicker you can farm high level mobs that drop more G/hour.
---
My dad works for Blizzard. Just send your personal information, Credit card number and mothers maiden name in a pm and I'll make sure you get one aswell!!
---
Ion said it would only be for the first few weeks tho. So hopefully not even a month
---
This is the most accurate. I'm unsubbing until August.
---
Amen. No more homogenized classes with nothing special about any of them aoe face smashing 15 mobs at once
---
Classic is the most casual friendly MMO to ever exist. While BFA only caters to the hardcore, classic is perfect for casual players! You have a ton of content you can solo, and tons of relevant smaller group content too. Also time is never an issue in Classic. You ever felt pressured to play by daily and weekly rewards that are too good to pass up? Well, classic is for you. You can always log in, whenever you want and to meaningful content for you. You can always log out when you want, no problem. Can only play for 30 minutes a day? No problem. Only 15 minutes a week? Still no problem. Just do a few quests a day, and you can log out happy knowing you progressed and youre not missing out on anything at all.
---
Is your heart currently beating?
---
Can you show up on time?
---
Congratz, you have a raid spot.
---
did you play the stress test or follow this sub at all?
---
there are countless bugs that still need to be fixed.
---
things take time.
---
Yeah I remember the glow being a bit more subtle. I quit in 2016, but at that point it seemed overdone and I couldn't even use it if I wanted to.
---
I definitely agree getting an authentic classic experience and squashing bugs comes before any optional fluff.
---
Most players never got to level 50. Only around 10% got to 60 in vanilla.
---
&gt; daily reminder that this guy didn't even make it into the stress test even though he's one of three original vanilla game devs. while everyone was having fun on the stress test he was literally streaming himself watching vanilla wow vids for hours on end
---
​
---
&gt; don't @ me if you actually think he doesn't want to play and just wants to sit and watch classic vids for 6 hours
---
“Daily reminder” that he's had beta access since day one and didn't want to play, until he caved and finally logged in and has been playing this whole time. LOL
---
Damn, how does that egg feel on your face?
---
When did Gnomish Death Ray get patched? Was that the pre-patch to B.C or pre 1.12? I know they patched it so it wouldnt crit for 3k at some point. Would love to see the old Death Ray in action.
---
Silithus &lt;-&gt; Darnassus: I could walk away and take a shower.  AH THE MEMORIES
---
Ah, another opinion post posed as fact.
---
Is this from the beta?
---
Yes, and the best thing is. If you are like me, a super casual with little time. You will still find it enjoyable :)
---
When someone is actively trying to figure out how to maximize DPS/HPS by rethinking their talents and spell/ability rotations. People who just stick to what they know and do not attempt to change things are the biggest anchors in a raid.
---
Ever blow a Magic Missile trying to get something off your shoulder? Fun times. Mage Armor/Shield doesn't do much for ya once one gets attached. Then they just *suck suck suck* all those d4 HD away.
---
Paladin leveling is indeed slow, but they might be the most powerful class for raiding and pvp if you like healing. Don't roll it if you want to dps, though ret is still higher dps than enhancement shaman.
---
They are nigh unkillable in group pvp, have incredible buffs for groups, and have the best mana efficiency out of all the healers.
---
ah lol \^\^
---
I disagree with almost everything you said.
---
Take a look at this video from Vanilla, I timestamped him turning stealth where you can see the animation:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw&amp;t=5m19s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw&amp;t=5m19s)
---
This actually means alot in forms of gameplay.
---
In Classic we"ll spend a ton of time flying around on a flight path. 
---
Its awesome you put in the effort to find so much source material to work with. This way Blizzard can actually take this a little more serious then just another rant. Hope this gets looked into, and its another sign that we're not fully there yet.
---
Y’all should maybe take a look at literally every single one of Kern’s business ventures since he left Blizzard before putting him on a pedestal like that. If he had the secret to vanilla’s success maybe he’d have acted on it instead of just lighting millions of dollars on fire with shitty marketing stunts for go-nowhere games and devolving in to a huge screaming baby when things don’t go his way. Vet your damn icons before you blindly follow them cuz they said the right thing once.
---
God forbid you don't start off immediately powerful and actually have to work a bit to get stronger. The horror!
---
&gt; Are the classes just wildly different in live now that it would be a bad idea?
---
Classes now often even have completely different mechanics. Shadow priests on Live, for example, simply don't need Mana any more for their damage spells. Instead, they try to gain enough Insanity (secondary resource not even present in Classic, which is gained through damage spells) to trigger Voidform, which lets them do more damage, but which also drains Insanity increasingly fast. The goal in Void Form then is to not let Insanity drop to zero for as long as possible.
---
This whole shtick around Void Form/Insanity simply does not exist in Classic, so everything you would learn would be a bad habit of not watching your Mana in Classic, which is something that's absolutely crucial there. 
---
There is a reason why Vanilla is getting resurrected: It's as good as a completely different game to current retail. Kinda like you would not really learn anything about playing Diablo by playing Diablo Immortal.
---
&gt;This is your opinion, but the reality is actually that plenty of guilds in retail have now issues filling their raid roster, despite your "vastly better designed" and "challenging raids".
---
This has ALWAYS been a thing. There has ALWAYS been a challenge to maintain a roster.
---
Yes, BFA might not currently be the most loved expansion and a fair number aren't playing as much as before, but this isn't really anything new either.
---
I currently mythic raid. I can tell you for a fact that we have had issues with roster and maintaining it. HOWEVER, of all the people that quit the game it IS NOT THE RAIDS which cause them to quit.
---
They quit DESPITE the raiding being better than it has ever been. It is the other parts of the game which are very lacklustre currently.
---
&gt;and BfA is basically hovering under 2 million subs, with probably less than 800k active players.
---
This is just an unsubstantiated number.
---
&gt;My opinion is not based on my personal view on the game
---
Yes it is.
---
Funny how the internet has made things like this completely obsolete
---
What do you have over there? Dude, is that from my hat collection? When did you steal it? And why did you take exactly the one I handmade from tinfoil?
---
Thanks Blizzard for letting us spend summer at the beach :)
---
You assuming the point of this whole sub is to complain about retail, as well as assuming I like d.va (more of a junkrat fan, cool accent) isn't too cool. It's apparent why you're in this subreddit, but there are many others here to just get content updates in a localized fashion and keep up with changes. 
---
You keep on complaining, I'll keep an open mind, maybe one day we will run SFK together, who knows.
---
Im with no changes, but this is ridiculous
---
Yeah but if im caught out I’m as good as dead low levels.
---
Alchemy is consistent due to arcanite bars however the big money is from flasks which most people won't have access to.
---
Before you are 60 the best thing you can do is try and get 60.
---
it’s not even just if you miss the Win. if someone witnesses you just miss a *Kill* in one of those games they are going to spam in chat “you are complete trash. you are bad at this game. uninstall”
---
I miss sending pictures like this to Blizz hoping to get them spotlighted as the Screenshot of the Day :)
---
Random redditor intentionally posting their opinion as a fact so that they can get maximum publicity from triggered people.
---
Hahhaha had an similar experience.
---
Was in the orc starting zone and began walljumping out of it. Felt like such a discovery and was really excited to see what was out there.
---
I came to a river east of barrens and a skull crocodile killed me.... just started a new character since i believed i would never manage to return to the starting area. And this place was too dangerous.
---
yeah cause the games totally fine to release tomorrow right.  smh..
---
IF was the main hub because it was closest to BRM when MC and BWL were current. So yes, naturally it will become the main hub again once people are 60 and running BRM.
---
Honestly, not completely. There are some really handle tables in the back of the Master Guide, in particular, that are not duplicated so neatly and easily accessible anywhere online as far as I can tell.
---
Classic isn’t even out yet and already you modern wow players are trying to ruin it by pushing for modern day wow QoL changes.
---
True shit
---
the trouble as i see it is that with no changes we control the game, and the community knows what it gets. As soon as you start making changes things like updating graphics come into play. If they were to design new maps (he does entertain the possibility of reusing old xpac assets which could be cool) would they design them in janky 2004 models? At what point can you overhaul the whole thing so you dont have great models next to crappy terrain, and if that will be the case in OG azeroth suddenly the community will be divided on what at face value was a simple decision.
---
Blizzard may well keep in line with classic design pillars, but im willing to believe we all have slightly different ideas of what makes classic classic, and some people are going to have real wacky ideas on that (and plenty more will think everyone else has real wacky ideas)
---
I found it on 4chan ages back. Not sure if it was /v/ or /vg/.
---
Most likely from Nostalrius.
---
What self respecting warlock didn’t use necrosis?
---
&gt;if they don't like what I like, they're circlerjerking
---
Did the same in Teldrassil, with The Relics of Wakening and Ursal the Mauler with 1-2 others. Was a great time and very nostalgic. I really like that the starting zones encourage grouping for the tougher quests(of course amplified by a level 5 cap). It's understandable that they added NPCs to accompany you in retail since the player population was much more scarce, but it's not the same at all.
---
Wow, so glad he won't be playing
---
Ah yes, the loading screens, how I miss them.
---
jokes on you, I'm alliance but I still downvoted you
---
well now i want that on my wall
---
It's not so simple. Some classes are better at making money with certain professions. For example, classes that can solo Princess Therardras in Maraudon (hunters and warlocks), will have access to a great deal of Ghost Mushrooms whilst running the dungeon, making herbalism particularly profitable for them.
---
Alternatively, 2 manning DM East with a tank (with mining) and a healer (with enchanting) as another highly lucrative combo. 
---
So ultimately certainly professions will benefit certain classes more than others.
---
this is when people stop caring. if we don't fight for it now we will never get it
---
Definitely! But you will repopulated, stealth and put a moral pressure to your opponent for the next 20 minutes even if you left the zone. While I will repopulated and get ganked again!
---
Yes weapon DPS multiplied by weapon speed is the weapon’s average hit.
---
Trouble is its really hard to tell someone that what they want is wrong. 'You think you do but you dont'. I guarantee you that will come out if blizzard makes any decision that splits the community, and the only thing they can do that nobody can really rail on them for is following the previous expansion route to wrath at least, hence why i think they will do it
---
I was a fighter and the rogue used her crossbow.  Critically failed.
---
It was a fun encounter x.x
---
Engineering for sure. It's pretty much mandatory as a Warrior.
---
Positioning is everything. Also show up on time with repairs and consumes. Raid time means if raid starts at 3 then first pull should be at 3.
---
Honestly this is just as silly to me as the gnome size thing. I could care less about how I look when walking in stealth, as long as the core gameplay I've been craving it there.
---
My fear about layering is not so much that it might be exploitable -- I think Blizzard would find ways to stop that really easily.
---
I'm worried that will ruin the immersion, the feeling of each realm being *one* world (as opposed to be many parallel worlds). Just imagine a friend telling you that there's a huge PvP raid going on in Ironforge, but once you get there, you can't see anything going on because you ended up on a different layer. Not to mention the jarring experience of switching between layers that can happen when you join a new group.
---
I'd prefer that there'd be no layering going on at all. Maybe the first weeks after launch would be rough, but I'd rather take that than playing in a fragmented game world.
---
Not really. The Internet used to be like the Wild West and everything on it was far more volatile than now.
---
Today you can easily get banned from online games for being rude, insulting people, and generally upsetting the peace, but in older games in their prime such as WC3 and WoW, people would talk constant shit with far harsher language than people use now and almost always without consequences. 
---
15 years ago it was really common to use slurs on the Internet to get on people's nerves and insult them, now people are more socially aware. Now, even calling someone a moron is considered intolerable, let alone slurs, or playing the game in a way that would upset other players. Even doing things against the ToS was easier to get away with, and the ToS in games were almost always far more lenient than today.
---
For example, in WoW's case, it was perfectly within the rules during TBC and WotLK to rob and strip a guild bank to the bone and if you were e.g an Officer, it was considered the GM's fault for giving you permission to do that. The only time Blizzard cared was if the access was illegitimate, such as from someone getting hacked. But Blizzard and everyone else's attitudes towards that changed with time.
---
Attitudes like this were pretty common in older MMOs, and WoW was actually pretty casual compared to most, since people did far, far worse in games like UO where you could scam 15 people into buying the same house that *you don't even own*, and use the money to fund killing and looting them all (yes, things like this actually happened).
---
Not saying this was better or defending it, BTW, but that's how it was — the Internet is far less toxic today.
---
There’s other ways to do that without using clickbait titles
---
Vanilla already made it awkward to join your friends when you were scattered about the world but decided to run an instance nowhere near any of you lol
---
I think your idea works just fine. People will have to consider whether they really need to layer hop before they do it.
---
I think youre thinking just from your servers perspective. Other servers it was most often alliance that was more popular
---
I swear a lot of the haters forgot we used to call it World of Warcrack.
---
You're not going to get a very unbiased answer here.
---
I would say go for it, simply because it's a good intro into the genre and Retail is just saturated with content (most of which you won't touch any time soon, if ever).
---
Only Onyxia is going to drop the plans during Phase 1. It’s going to be very lucrative.
---
Wish I played on 34 servers too.
---
I mean really thats still a gear reset. Its probably a better way to do it, but the point is that normall you have to progress through all the content to get good gear, a gear reset is when you dont have to. Pre raid 70 could be nowhere near as good as a naxx geared player, but so long as they can complete the first BC raid and start the gearing process there that is what makes it a gear reset.
---
I dont think the term itself necessarily entails routinely making gear feel worthless, even if thats what people associate it with (possibly because thats how its been done recently).
---
Think its just called AutoCraft.
---
I’m sure I can be ahead of the general population but I’m not sure I’ll get the enjoyment from rushing to max. Either way I’ll be playing a ton
---
You're right about that, I love it! It's almost as if we like something more than something else! Who would've thunk it!?
---
yet to collectors they mean everything
---
Shimmering flats is an area inside the thousand needles zone so you're right on ;)
---
    Not sure why you’re being downvoted
---
Reddit users 😓
---
I’m not even expressing if i like or dislike it. I was simpy stating what i heard.
---
Allright man. Sure. Horde was way more popular.
---
Now he’s CEO lol
---
Honestly, he's right. I logged into the stress test, and the UI from classic is awful. I couldn't even find the menu to buy a boost token for my character. Lmfao garbage game!
---
Populated*
---
Learn your classes most efficient gold farm methods and spam those until you can afford your epic mount, any BOE prebis, and all the consumables you want for PVP or PVE
---
Based on the state of the beta and stress test, the game still needs a LOT of work, and that is only the level 1/30 range...
---
But I guess they're not releasing it in june/july because of  publicity ??
---
Even what he described is too easy.  Think about it.  It's an RPG, and he's a LVL 1 skeleton/zombie-man, and he killed a wolf in a few attacks.
---
Hi, /u/runnbl3
---
I think my parents are just not familiar with such activities. They still can‘t understand why I was playing this much in 2004/05/06 but they respect it now. I made my way and graduated in computer science. So this had a postive impact to some degree :)
---
I have a loving wife (also not gaming) and a little child and still a nerd. And in my mind I blueprint the conversation I will have with my child in 8 to 9 years: Do what you want, but do it the right way. If you need help, don’t be afraid to ask. 
---
Exactly the same as my parents did :)
---
For many people cosmetic changes are the world. How is this "silly"? My best friend often plays with sound muted, while gaming without sound for me is impossible. It's just dull. Animations and co. are just as important as the gameplay for many people. It doesn't even need to be AAA quality, it just needs to fit and work. And in this case, the nostalgia is sated best with the right animations.
---
That’s how it was in vanilla.
---
ok.
---
Wait until August 30th, if you aren't playing by then - ggwp!
---
Somewhere around 3-4k gold would be the ball park where i would think its fine. Not something everyone would get but not something completly imposible. Or stick it at the end of an 25+ quest chain requiring raids, pvp, dungeons, and solo content.
---
thanks for reminding me how trash the last season of got was i almost forgot
---
be quiet stinky no it wouldn't
---
Die in a month.
---
Oh.
---
Okay.
---
I think it depends how its implemented. The way i could see it working is with some severe restrictions, that would heavily impede the fantasy aspect of it (im talking cant fly high in the sky, and real damn slow, so it might feel silly) but you would retain people being IN the world, and still retain the awesomeness of flight accessible areas or flying mounts.
---
You can't enjoy any game with already negative mindset when starting out.
---
He left because making an MMO is a mind-numbingly arduous task and was tired of it.  Why do you think so many old school wow devs DONT PLAY?
---
And he was voted out of Red 5 because the board wanted to make Firefall like WoW, which Mark Kern specifically wanted it to be different.
---
And I'm not groveling, I'm respecting him.  May not seem too different in your eyes, but that's not my problem.
---
I uses to crash out so often on flightpaths. I used to set myself a target before sleeping but when you have been up for 20+ hours flightpaths can be dangerous.
---
This comment right here. Right now they are in fixing overdrive mode. I'm sure they want release as polished as possible and no error that is found can be too small. Although personally this one is #1 for me because I love playing rogue haha.
---
Lol, YUUUUP
---
There is /assist Player for auto attack but I don't know if that'd work for Wands. Have you tried the following:
---
\&gt; /run if not IsCurrentAction(13) then UseAction(13) end;
---
And putting Wand on 13 (action page 2, slot 1)
---
Just saying in general, it's an issue that's plaguing every Industry.
---
I guess this sub can't take a joke, I added a /s now.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=207
---
That's what I went by. I also played shaman in vanilla. Your link must be from before 1.12.
---
Hunters just get bad rep because people who doesn't know jack shit about the class likes to roll them. And since they have a moderately high skill ceiling, you can easily fuck up.
---
Kind of... they made numerous joke videos back when this video dropped. It’s kind of what they did. This one just stuck.
---
That's all well and good, but you can't unring the bell.
---
I'm probably someone that needs to circlejerk harder in the future.

Whistle that brings you to nearest flight path - hooray I did the thing!

animations are client side dumbass
---
I loved the 39 bracket, as I felt it was the most balanced.  19 and 29 had too many rogues and hunters, and not enough anything else.  39 is when most classes started to shine and could hold their own in organised PVP.
---
very kawaii idea, thanks for sharing
---
Instant gratification retail crowd. Have fun for a day every new patch.
---
There was a complete google doc list with lvl 30 bis gear for every class but i cant find it, anyone knows the link?
---
From what I can understand from  [https://clips.twitch.tv/TangentialDelightfulWatercressSMOrc](https://clips.twitch.tv/TangentialDelightfulWatercressSMOrc)
---
`/cast !Auto Shoot`
---
should work.
---
Yes but being l60 is a huuuge economic advantage. You can kill better stuff or kill stuff more quickly. Higher level items are worth more money, generally speaking. 
---
So if you want to make money, you gotta rush 60.
---
Twinking items cannot be farmed, or at least not be farmed on the timescale available.
---
Can you imagine all the Gryphon crap all over that hallway entrance? Dwarves and Gnomes wading through chin deep turds to get into Ironforge.
---
Doesn’t count.  Do it with a Night Elf to Elwynn and then we’ll talk meme worthiness.
---
TBH i’m just trying to understand it but by no means have anything other then anecdotal experience through myself (23 - Gaming online since I was 12 with CS and WoW / and my little brother who is 12 - been gaming online since he was in diapers)
---
They need to find a way to implement flying that retains awesome looking mounts, and incredible fantasy flight accessible zones, without it being the goto mode of travel. If i spend 95% of my travel on the ground, but can flex with my awesome mount and can eventually traverse Storm Peaks or Blades Edge with a flying mount then that still feels like an RPG. The real question is with those impositions in place, can they be worked around, and are they so cumbersome as to negate the coolness of flying?
---
Hurt much?
---
I believe the lighting can be modified with the /ffxglow command as per: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs8n23/how_to_fix_the_bright_glow_with_a_console_command/
---
I think main issue is the gryphon banking into turns in Vanilla and not doing it here which makes it feel alot more 'threaded' and robotic.
---
Really??
---
And animation is triggered by what? Fairy dust?
---
I was worried I wasn't going to get one. It's just so delayed for F&amp;F. Kinda disappointing.
---
Remember when you got that sweet first green ring around level 25? Every quest reward may now randomly upgrade its quality, and boom, you get an epic ring for delivering a letter.
---
1. There is no sharding, there is layering which is like sharding but not cross-server. You will always play with ppl on your realm.  
---
2. (Unless i'm the one misunderstanding) They were referring to the low render distance that would cause things to noticeably pop into view back in the olden days.
---
Looting a mob loots every single mob in a big radius around the corpse.
---
You can get a mount at level 1 that can never be dazed.
---
There are mounts that give you water walking for every class and since mounts are shared between all your characters you can permanently gain water walking as any class.
---
I don't think anything of the changes (LFG, LFD, Sharding, CRZ, etc) were wrong.  I think they were very necessary AT THE TIME.  The problem is that wow no longer FORCED us to want to group, so it's human nature that if given the choice, we would choose the path of least resistance (IE, not socializing).
---
At this point, I think wow is too deep, and unless they pull some crazy shit out of their ass, the only way to fix modern wow is to do a complete reboot, AKA WoW 2.
---
Horde, most streamers will go Horde and sheep will follow
---
In my opinion the scarcity of appropriate healy drops (especially plate) makes it perfectly acceptable to roll on cloth, leather, mail, etc. That said, a lot of us are going into this after years of the live game where this problem hasn't been a problem 1-60 since Cata. A lot of us may have forgotten this and be irritated to lose a cloth drop to a paladin or something. I recommend sorting this out when your group initially forms before you set foot in the instance. This way if your group does not understand this and isn't willing to let you roll against the other casters you can politely opt out and find another group without conflict and drama.
---
Always clarify loot rules before you enter the instance. People have very different ideas of what is and isn't fair loot distribution. Your druid tank group leader could rage-kick your shaman or paladin for rolling on healy leather he could have used for his resto off-spec "because it's leather you ninja" and he doesn't understand the loot distribution while leveling.
---
oh wow, that's a great idea..
---
paladins and locks were the only class with class mounts back then, weren't they?
---
Wtf is lobby camping?
---
This is a large part of what makes people attracted to classic. Some people view the combat in the way you've described, and it's absolutely correct. It is a lot of auto attacking and wanding, and front-loading spells. It is a lot of downtime and mana efficiency. But to me (and many others) all these things sound very fun. I like that the auto-attacks matter, and the spells/abilites are costly. Although I enjoy the experience of leveling druids the most, I also love leveling paladins, warriors and priests. I know there are not a lot of things for me to do while actually killing mobs, it's mostly auto-attacking, but the strategy around pulling mobs and the enjoyment of grouping up (and actually being able to pull two mobs!) is just so indescribably rewarding. And having to worry about mana while healing is actually what I'm most excited about in vanilla.
---
I think it's wrong to frame this as either good or bad. It's just a preference. Some people prefer the slow-gratification of classic (finishing a long quest line is so rewarding!) and others simply prefer other types of games.
---
Arguing about this is pointless.
---
Riight
---
Lol what a load of nonsense. Vanilla was always Alliance heavy and this is an even bigger issue on private servers.
---
But it's so fuuuunnnn
---
You're pretty far off with that comment, but cool
---
I played with them in vanilla, and you’re wrong.
---
Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
---
I played a deep affliction 'lock quite a bit and while they can't AoE farm like mages can, I would use a technique that I would call "serial AoE". In a nutshell, I would send my VW to a mob, dot it up, then immediately send my VW to the next mob, dot it up, send VW to ... and continue until all the mobs in the immediate area were dead. While doing this I would loot the mobs that were dead, life tap as needed to regain mana, drain life on most recently dotted mob if I needed health, etc. Basically, be continuously active until everything in my vicinity was dead and then go running off to the next area to repeat. A few things to note about warlocks.
---
1. First Aid is wonderful. I wouldn't bother to carry food or water, just bandages. Low on mana? Lifetap, then slap a bandage on you to regain the health.
---
2. When your VW is out of mana, don't wait for it to regain mana. Simply sacrifice it and summon a new one.
---
And remember the motto of warlocks... "If it's fearable, it's killable".
---
A good demonstration of this is when you hit level 40, you can solo the elite dragons at the southern end of Lethlore Ravine in Badlands... naked. As in no gear what so ever. No weapons, no trinkets, no armor, nothing. And as a nice advantage, no repair bills if you screw up and die. The key is deep affliction into Dark Pact, using a phase shifted imp as a mana battery, and keeping the elite dragon you're killing feared and dotted up.
---
Flying was a defining feature of TBC, something to entice customers to buy it. Gliders would not have done that. Of course, in retrospect, flying was probably the biggest, most impactful mistake that Blizzard made in the history of WoW - one they even tried to rectify by removing flying in WoD, only to revert the decision in the face of backlash.
---
Right, I think you should just stick with BFA hero
---
On Pservers Alliance always outnumber the horde vastly.
---
All the things you call tedious, is what makes the reward, and community. When you spend 30min to get everyone to the dungeon, you want to finish that dungoen with the group you have gathered. And the time you have invested will be rewarded when you have done, I doesn't matter if you end up getting any loot. Just the fact that you have invested so much time into it  will make you feel accomplished for killing the boss. If it was easy to get another party member there with the likes of the summoning stone you wouldn't think twice before you replace the guy that fked up the cc or something like that. So that is game play that makes the community more toxic and that's not what classic is about. So instead you want to educate the players in your group, so you can complete the dungoen. 
---
This is just one example but that is the philosophy about all the content in classic. If you dont like that dont play there are lots of single player games out there for you to choose from. This is a once in a life time game
---
Rogues that could mine made bank in vanilla collecting dark iron ore from BRD. A druid could probably do the same but I can't vouch for that.
---
All druid and rogue stealth BRD runs skipping trash were awesome too.
---
Here you go, /u/lolsk8s

I found [this](http://i.imgur.com/19WBa7x.png) for you. Please use it in the future.

you get a quest in deathknell to kill wolves and bats pretty early on

I'm pretty sure they are well trained! Unlike bats.
---
Okay then gotcha!
---
Yes. 5 minutes CD.
---
Yes you are right and I feel the same
---
Finding Minerals(or whatever it's called) from Mining appears in the buff row, it should be a circular icon at the top left of the minimap.
---
I mean, at this point, Modern and Classic wow are two different games.  So don't feel bad for wanting to play Classic.
---
When you start playing retail your wife will want sex all the time and won’t stop talking afterwards.

Sucks cause she keeps calling me late at night from her hotel room.

This is cool. :)

I was particularly surprised with this one: https://classictinker.com/flight-master/?fromLoc=Light%27s+Hope+Chapel%2C+Eastern+Plaguelands&amp;toLoc=Booty+Bay%2C+Stranglethorn&amp;faction=alliance
---
This is exactly the type of content I want to see here.
---
I've thought long and hard about it and it's less about Casual vs Hardcore and more about accessibility and comfort/QOL against small communities and feel of a Roleplay world.
---
A lot of people prefer one over the other, and many things come back to these two sides.
---
Esfand only puts on a nice guy persona.
---
See you again, soon.
---
&gt; if it’s an upgrade, roll for it
---
&gt; and no you can’t argue the same about bows
---
If it’s an upgrade, roll for it. Hunters are gonna roll on my swords and daggers, I’m rolling on their guns and bows.
---
okay buddy
---
As someone who dabbled in BFA Mythic raiding, no one is arguing about whether that specific niche of WoW is more challenging and better designed. They completely are. However, you also need to remember that Mythic raiding in general is a very small portion of people. LFR and Normal raiding is pretty simple and not nearly as complex.
---
With that said, I found it to be pretty boring and I'd rather throw sbolts on rotation while conquering vanilla content for the Nth time than sit through what WoW is currently.
---
Shoot. I was hoping they'd fixed it lol
---
Huh, it's almost like Blizzard could produce a dynamic respawn system that wasn't abuseable. It's almost as if dynamic respawns could be introduced in a way that is both literally blizzlike, and harmless.
---
Yes everyone in vanilla experienced idiots running over the eggs. If you did UBRS in vanilla this happened to you.
---
Server transfers also exacerbate faction balance. According to the devs, time and time again their data shows that free transfers have led to people moving to servers where their faction is more heavily favored.
---
If transfers were cheaper, every server in the world would be 100% Horde or 100% Alliance.
---
Turns out players *say* they want faction balance only when it's their faction that is the minority. Otherwise, they don't care.
---
I'm still social and make friends in Retail. That's probably mind blowing to some.
---
I was really happy when I saw they announced it on 27th, got lots of shit to do this summer. And 27th August is a perfect release date for me at least.
---
It does work with WoW Classic. :)

Guess what happens when you walk faster...
---
Dude i hate this. Mounts that offer that kind of utility. I hate the fact that i need to have action bar slots to ugly ass mounts like the rep mount and the water walking mount.
---
I assumed the problem was with sharding since the pop-in for flights is a current issue with live, and the render distance has been much higher for a long time now.
---
Druid is great in PVP, especialy in outnumbered situations...
---
And here's a list a spells you get after lvl 30..
---
\-Ravage
---
\- ferocious bite
---
\- Pounce
---
\- frenzied regeneration
---
\- Dire Bear form
---
\- Feline grace,
---
\-Hurricane
---
\- Innervate
---
\- (moonkin form)
---
\- Barkskin
---
You're missing the most important spells for feral.
---
Yes. I Multiboxed the Beta. EMA also got updated. She is pretty cool.  Is Multiboxing 5 Shamans viable at all?   
---
Since I am a new Multiboxer, I am curious, if it is worth to bot 5 Shamans or so? 5 Hunter sounds intresting as well, but I plan to maybe Solo Dungeons up to LBRS/BRD.
---
This no changes movement is kinda going to far
---
The flight paths I agree as current animation looks like ass. However for this the old rogue stealth looked like they were gliding across the world...
---
So you have no counterargument other than "u mad"
---
Enchanting. You can get 5-10g end game tips for most end tier wep enchants. I made 800g in about 2hrs doing Crusader enchants after farming up the receipe on a fresh pserver.
---
Why you on the classic subreddit if it sucks? Curious
---
I was still using OG decursive when BWL was out
---
It really isn't ridiculous at all. It was an immersive feature of Vanilla that was lost over the years. What's wrong with pointing it out so that Blizzard can reimplement it?
---
I don't quite agree with that. I think there is a rash of games that don't understand the fun value of delayed gratification, but I don't think younger generations are the cause of this.
---
I mean, it doesn't make intuitive sense that tedium and frustration can make a game more fun. I think it's more that developers lose faith in their game and make bad decisions. Hell, people were asking for sweeping "QoL" changes in WoW even back in Vanilla, but Blizzard knew enough about MMOs to know not to implement them.
---
Then there was a lot of talk about several streamers going alliance. Even trying to convince soda to go alliance. 
---
It's hard to tell which side streamers are going. Hhmm.
---
Doesn't sound like Classic is for you my dude. Nothing wrong with that at all, but it sounds like you have a strong dislike for what makes the game great. That's okay.
---
If you really think Nostalrius was getting more players than retail you are delusional sorry.
---
Yes.
---
Personally I feel like if you want to maximise gold per hour you need several friends that send all their excess gold to one bank alt that sniped all items whose value will drastically appreciate. After you sell all the items you can share in the profits, but you would all have to trust each other.
---
Other than that rush to 60 and keep skinning upto your level and grind beasts for the last few levels and vendor all the items, maybe try to farm Devilsaurs with friends before they are camped 24/7
---
I'm honestly really looking forward to this and the economy not being totally fucked
---
Yea I thought alliance dominated vanilla too
---
You actually sit there and watch your character on flight paths? I literally tab out and do something else every single time, even on short flights.
---
Or maybe that's when they think the game will be ready
---
I would honestly recommend sticking with one until 60, especially if you're playing on a PvP server.
---
Wildstar tried too hard to be WoW, and make it arbitrarily hard for no reason other than to be difficult.
---
Modern MMOs fail because they try to hard to copy WoW and not take the risk to try something new and different.  Why play "New MMO X" if it looks and feels exactly like WoW when you can just keep playing WoW?  Gamers are tired of the same old thing and are craving for something new.  Classic WoW, at this point, is different enough to satisfy this need.
---
But ultimately, the next "WoW-Killer"  needs to be nothing like WoW.
---
25+ dungeon chain capped with MC and 5k gold, I think I'd be okay with it. But I still doubt it would happen . . Maybe after phase 6?
---
Nobody is threatened by classic, they are annoyed by all the posts by people here saying that retail sucks.
---
Lets summarize your post.
---
TBC is essentially "classic" with slightly better balanced gear and specs. That's pretty much it. Ofcourse it's a continuation but it's pretty much 90% the same game at it's core.
---
So you log into Classic beta, do a single quest and you suddenly know about all it's disadvantages compared to a game that you like, but it's pretty much the same? 
---
You aren't influenced by TBC, you are influenced by post WotLK expansions.
---
&gt; when flying over a zone youve never seen before cause it gives a little preview of things to come
---
How could you do this? You'd have to enter the zone first to get the flight point. There are almost no instances of flying over a zone that you don't have a flight point for.
---
Im saying if you want to take advantage of fresh economy you should rush to 60.
---
Unless you know all the niche items that will sell well now. But even then being level 60 just opens up way more options
---
Im wondering how it calculates the average boat wait
---
Gear/stats don’t matter in retail. Only stat that matters is the ilevel of the gear. This is made worse via transmogs (changing the appearance of your gear). You can’t tell the noobs apart from the people that know what the fuck is going on
---
Alliance is super favored in all aspects of the game. Anyone telling you otherwise is literally unaware. Paladin buffs are op and make raids easier, top mage/lock damage is all gnome. Top warriors/rogues is all human because sword specialization is best talent. AV is heavily ally favored so most AV's ally will win. Paladins are literally best heals in game. Ally quests &gt; horde quests overral. Geographic positions of bases/flightpaths is ally favored. 
---
Obviously more people will be ally. Playing ally is like playing the game on easy mode. Playing horde is playing the game on normal mode. Horde may have a chance at pvp with hardiness/will of forsaken but escape artist is too strong. Also dwarf priest racials are bis.
---
I do think it would be really cool to see them add more content to classic instead of doing TBC (although I do love TBC). You can bring in some of the improvements TBC had (like spec specific tier sets, class balance changes, etc.) in new level 60 content set on Azeroth but keep things like Dungeon Finder, flying mounts, etc. from ever coming into the equation. Do a different take on the zones added to Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdoms in Cataclysm (pre-Cata Hyjal, for example). Actually execute on ideas they had planned for Vanilla but got stripped out-&gt; level 60 Karazhan, Karazhan Crypts, Dragon Isles... there's a lot to work with.
---
People playing it for the first time are... going to notice that it's different from how it was when they didn't play it?
---
I think people are being a little harsh on live. 
---
You can learn about rotations and spell priority. You can learn about spell interrupts and CC.  If you level up naturally, many of the zones will be the same or fairly similar, with some quests being fairly congruent. At the very least you will learn the basic structure of WoW, which has always been questing. 
---
While live won’t be the same as classic, the concepts will be the same. Also, if you get into dungeons, especially mythic dungeons, a lot of the mechanics you’ll encounter are actually even more complex than some Vanilla raid bosses. 
---
If you’re curious, it definitely won’t hurt.  Having played Vanilla, and now going back to it in the Beta with all my expanded knowledge 14-15 years later, the game itself is a lot easier than I remember the first go round, but the community is what really makes it a superior game.
---
Now add all the people that searched for wow battle for Azeroth.
---
Underdog? Lol ally is overpowered mate what
---
Amazing. thank you. Going to download ISboxer now and start practicing on shittail.
---
Which patch/expansion effectively killed the game? I know the numbers drop off right after Cataclysm and the LFR is what a lot of people say. I feel like the game was killed in patch 3.2.0. The only reason a lot of us stuck around after that was to kill Arthas and then to at least see the new world after the Cata rework.
---
Are you toxic? Genuinely curious.
---
It's why "fun" is subjective, which can also change over time. 
---
I used to love platformers as a child, but I don't anymore, I just grew out of it.
---
Delayed gratification definitely works in subscription based games for obvious reasons.
---
I agree. I long for the days when games were broken and never fixed because they couldn't put out patches.
---
Discovering the MMORPG genre through WoW was glorious. I too am envious.
---
retard
---
dont forget: if you fly you can go afk inbetween without missing the boat(s) :p
---
It was though.
---
It depends on your strategy I suppose. Taking a bunch of geared melee and cleaving through packs of mobs would probably be the fastest strat but having a bunch of mages and doing huge pulls with what you described as a tank could also be pretty good. 
---
I’m not 100% sure on if the buff from the shield would stick after removing it but generally procs/on uses are removed when you remove the item. Doing stuff like that only really works when it’s a debuff applied to enemies aka nightfall or that two hander that debuff’s Armor
---
24% upvoted. /thread
---
Already there
---
Yeah, because aggroing 10 mobs and barely taking any damage is much more fun.
---
You dont know what you're talking about tbh
---
That was a very thoughtful and eloquent comment, but could you expand o n it?
---
Aside from the "Thats how we did it in my day" mentality, why is this change bad?
---
Sounds like *you* hate me, but thanks for the snide comment.
---
No but now I'm going to :)
---
That person is wrong and their mentality is what caused WoW to become the garbage pile it is now.
---
You don't have to return the quests and get next quest in qline from the npc's anymore. Most of the time you get popup where you can complete the quest and get a new one in 2 seconds just by clicking couple buttons.
---
Well at some point, the game because less about the journey and more about the destination.  The "destination" being endgame, IE: Raiding and PVP.
---
Modern wow is basically just a race to level cap in order to get to the "fun part" of the game.  I don't see this as anything but an expected consequence of having 7 expansions worth of content to slog through, so of course leveling feels like a chore, and endgame feeling like the only viable option to play.
---
This was part of vanilla and not a bug. Movement effects like charge, fear, sheep let you move straight through that veil. You just couldn't run through it manually.
---
Keep in mind that some things need to be experienced and a perspective dislike at face value could be judging a book by its cover
---
i dont really know... but that esfand video from the Beta looks more like the way i remember it  from classic. But this can be faulty memory.
---
it just wouldn't be very cash money of them
---
This sub seems to be hypocritical as fuck. Classic fans trashtalking retail? Thats fair game. Retail fans trashtalking classic? How dare these little pieces of shit?   
---
I get the feeling both sides cant just accept that both games have their up- downsides as they are so imcredibly different. But they rather feel threatened by each other. Everyone is fighting for daddy Blizzs attention. But guess what? We ALL are the middle children and the our sibling are profit and more profit. Retail wont be abbandoned, it makes cash. Classic is free cash on top of that, so that stays too. If $$ &gt; $ then we will get TBC servers too. Maybe even Wotlk, Classic+, etc. As long as $$$ we are good. So speak with your wallet or shut up.
---
That makes a lot of sense.
---
Classic has replay value. I’ve been playing it for 13 years on price servers. Doesn’t hurt to swipe clean. 
---
Adding content splits the community for people who don’t want change.
---
This, I can totally see people being hyped to PVP in Vanilla because I actually enjoyed it a lot.  On the PVE side, raiding was fun in Vanilla but now we are so much better at handling mechanics it will be a joke.
---
Maybe 5% but I generally go out of my way to try and help out others.
---
Everyone has their breaking point though.
---
bröther blizz hear our call
---
content over duty, always
---
Who dis?
---
You mean the days when games were finished products on release and bugs were mostly obscure?
---
Even Endgame has had several issues for years IMO, but that is a different story.
---
You're right about that. Expanding horizontally is difficult and keeping the leveling as long will put people off from playing the game. WoW also became more popular once they introduced more accessiblity in Wrath, so I reckon they think that that was the right approach.
---
He doesn't even know that he is going to need those hits with the staff to level up his skill.
---
It will 99.999% allowed. It becomes against the rules when you basically take over an entire zone for extended periods of time or intentionally lag/dc people
---
What about https://www.wowhead.com/item%3D20134/skyfury-helm for shaman?
---
It's an insidious plot by all the gnomes working at Blizzard. They know this is their opportunity to revise history and make themselves taller.
---
Fortunately, eagle eyed players have seen through this treacherous ploy. Don't let the gnomes win or soon they'll be taller than all of us!
---
No specific xpac "killed" the game; but the combination of various things from each xpac lead to the mess that things are in now.
---
I don't think we're doing ourselves any favors, discussing this stuff in terms of "casual" or "hardcore" players, and I'm not entirely sure that's how Blizzard were thinking about it. I believe they just wanted to make the game better, and to them, making dungeons and raids easier to do was an obvious choice. Too bad they didn't understand why the game was fun, or they might have seen it differently.
---
I mean, if Blizzard knew ahead of time the problems theses systems would cause, I doubt they would have implemented them. They have been objectively bad for sub retention, at least, and WoW has to rely on micro transactions as a crutch due to the sub hemorrhaging. It all sounds great in a vacuum, but they obviously didn't take enough time to understand the game's design philosophy.
---
If anyone else is trying to aoe grind as well your xp is crippled. Lots of people definitely have this idea, I definitely wouldn't recommend it.
---
&gt; Why BFA and Classic are mixed together, while RuneScape and OSRS are separate games?
---
I never watched runescape at all, but was OSRS regarded by twitch as a seperate game when in beta? Or if it never was in Beta were the games separated straight away or did this take time. 
---
I can very well think that such a split, if even needed, might only come when Classic is actually released and out of beta. 
---
Also who decides these splits? Is it solely Twitch, or Blizzard or Twitch and Blizzard? I could very well imagine for example that Blizzard sees it as better to just have a WoW category as it also will be one subscription.
---
&gt; This is your opinion, but the reality is actually that plenty of guilds in retail have now issues filling their raid roster, despite your "vastly better designed" and "challenging raids".
---
News flash, they aren't quitting because the raids suck.  They are quitting because of all the shit you have to do outside of the raids.  The raiding has been great the past like 3 expansions.
---
Chad looks like channing Tatum
---
Maybe classic WAS mediocre to that player, people forget about opinions sometimes, his problem was posting his opinion in the middle of a mobfest.
---
The guy handing out water to the marathon runners didn't make it either, but he's part of it.
---
I couldnt agree more. My original vanilla server had a faction imbalance and I transferred to one where the balance was slightly in my favor towards the end of vanilla. One the one hand, I'm glad I transferred to that server because of the experiences I had and the friends I ended up making in TBC. But on the other, that only made the imbalance issues worse for both servers. Gating factions seems like something easy to implement, and something that wouldnt feel like an intrusive or negative impact on the Classic experience. If anything, I think it would help. Ive played o. Servers with a near 1:1 balance, and it is so much better that way.
---
She should have known
---
Leveling is probably the most boring and least compelling. So much of your rotation is casting a judgement and then just sitting there on auto swing.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been a pally since day 1, but I don’t look back at Vanilla leveling fondly. 
---
All that said, if you’re on a PvP server or plan on PvP, it’s such a fantastic class, and on a PvP server a lot of classes won’t bother to try and gank you because it’s so hard to take you down and you have so many “oh shit” buttons.
---
we did it back in 2006 with a group of warrior, hpaladin, warlock, rogue and mage. 
---
it wasn’t too hard with poly, sap and succubus charm and we had bwl-aq gear. our rogue dc’d at the beast, the last boss was challenging with 4 people, but we managed to clear the instance :)
---
it’s one of my favorite memories from those good ol’ days, running lvl60 dungeons with fewer people was a lot of fun.
---
false   
---
Feel free to look it up yourself  
---
Out of all variations I tried, just "Warcraft" is the most popular one
---
I love WoW, but I’m a better version of myself when I severely limit its grip upon me... Classic is going to test me.
---
I mean, really everything will be needed, so anything that you specifically don't need, just AH it.
---
Just because there are no gems doesn't mean you can't capitalize on a different market. I may be biting myself in the ass here but I used to run the Coarse Stone market. Stones are needed for weapon sharpening for Blacksmiths and leveling engineering. I used to buy the entire market out and sell stacks at 3g a piece. I afforded my first mount at 40 with lots of gold left over. (Call me an asshole but hey, this is how you make money)
---
I'm excited.
---
I know leveling my engineering is going to make me absolutely monsterous in world PvP, because it had the same effect on my warrior. I'd imagine the effect is going to be even more dramatic as a paladin.
---
If you want to "abuse" a fresh economy, and insetad of googling it you make an unnecessary post, you've already failed my friend.
---
We're getting the last version of items before the pre-BC patch hit.
---
Well, there's a reason they're considered memespec. They legitimately aren't that good in classic, sadly.
---
all couples should be supportive of each other's hobbies
---
Agreed, I am very excited for Classic for the peer nostalgic feel. The beta stress test only heightened  that excitement. However I also currently enjoy retail as well, it makes me very sad seeing people who share more-or-less the same community at each-others throats. ELE (Everybody love Everybody)!
---
Whata shame. Another drop out.
---
Also the button on the bottom to “get off on the next stop” shouldn’t  be there.
---
We need $15/mo gryphons. These are $0.50 gryphons!!
---
That boggles my mind as someone who got lost for 45 minutes looking for Dire Mail in 2005.
---
WoW 2 is what we are playing now on retail, they just don't call it that.
---
Do you really need that degree,
---
Even if that would be true (which it clearly isn't) that would be smart move to make from a business standpoint. Release dates are always intended dates. All game companies "intentionally releases" games on a specifically chisen dates.  They don't just randomly release games in a 2 days notice. Just to inform you if that was a surprise for you.
---
In before Spearmint deletes it even though the ass wont pin a single fucking Laying thread..
---
Yeah I'm definitely going to be on a PvP server. I have so many fond memories of stranglethrone vale - I can imagine me actually being the paladin this time instead of my buddy will make it even better
---
Why should i hate you? They way you described vanilla implies that you won't like TBC for the same reasons. 
---
The fundamentals didn't change that much with TBC.
---
What are we talking about again?  You analogies are going strange places, friend.
---
I hope not, it would be in pretty poor taste to pvp with them.
---
It’s kind of a grey area
---
But mostly legal
---
40?!? Jesus, I wish I had that kind of money lol.
---
*AT LEAST* half of classics player base is going to quit within 3 months.
---
Please explain how more things to look out for and more personal responsibility does not generally make stuff harder? Now that I've typed it it may come off as snarky or whatever but I'm actually interested.
---
That's okay :)
---
If you didn't do bg's in vanilla you wouldn't know.
---
Cant explain the truth of this meme
---
ive seen so many people mention that he is the quintessential vanilla rogue. everything about his personality bleeds the og dirtbag rogue persona, right down to his keyboard
---
Bro rocket boots and rocket helm!
---
I submitted a but report the other night for the flight path from Loch Modan to Iron Forge. The flight path follows the later paths as if there was a FP at the quarry dig site in Dun Morogh. It even dips down almost exactly on the spot where the flight master exists in Cata.
---
To be honest I thought the date makes sense from a marketing standpoint. They started classic beta right before eso now expansion. Which took a lot of the news away from that game. If they release it in June which is a month before ff14 expansion, they might see articles that say wow subs dip because of the new ff14 expansion. Instead they choose a month after that and 2 weeks before monster hunter expansion. It keeps the news around wow classic in a busy time that would be around these other games. Also there is still a good amount of bugs that need to be taken care of obviously.
---
Yes, being able to experience in it's purity will be the best experience you can get. Bonus points if you stick around long enough to experience the natural progression to TBC
---
Warlocks do fine against shamans with proper pet management against totems. The only class you should have difficulty against is a rogue as you have 0 ways to get out of a stun unless you LAP.
---
Who needs a degree when you have rep to grind?
---
Yeah, this is just start -&gt; UC -&gt; zepp to orgr -&gt; little walk past some low level mobs.
---
Wetlands run is WAAYY more intense
---
Just you, no one else ever did it, ever
---
Ive done plenty of DPS in my time - there's plenty of classes that do it better so I don't mind tanking or learning to heal. 
---
I'm really interesting in how tanking as a paladin in the five mans works. Any advice?
---
better for whom and for how many?  
---
fads die out fast, don't rush to judge things
---
... They're gonna fly on mechanical gryphons and not on dynamic ones...
---
Got pics? A friend of mine is interested in their Darnassus.
---
This is definitely a bug. In vanilla you could drop the flag and spam clicks to pick up the flag again as it starts fading in.
---
Call me a grumpy old man, but releasing right as school semester starts is probably the best thing to happen.
---
I can still get tan, and classic won't be flooded by zoomers on summer break.
---
Hashtag just 30y/o vanilla boomer things
---
Only 6? Took 4 weeks :/
---
You don't mention twitch in your whole post?
---
Just give it a try, it's 15$ for a month, you can always cancel the subscription. Don't let us tell you if you'll enjoy something or not. If you can't afford to risk wasting 15$, then maybe there are bigger questions you need to ask.
---
Sick of these fucking threads.
---
R10 lock set is fine. Warlocks have a power spike near end of BWL / ZG patch before AQ comes out where they will actually outdps mages who are still frost at this point. However once mages go fire they should outdps warlocks every time from AQ onward
---
In this day and age, saying the wrong pronoun can get you in a trouble.
---
How fast troll walk animations are or something?
---
I was a 21 year old kid in college with a fake job and no responsibilities, Classic fit that perfectly. I have lifelong friends because of it, and over 400 days /played 1-70 **/cringe**
---
Today I’m 35, married with two toddlers, a mortgage, managing 16 engineers at work, budget meetings, continuing education credits... to say the least, the few hours I can give WoW, retail is *much* friendlier. My pals from 2005 won’t be back in any significant number on Classic, I keep up with them on Facebook these days- most are in the same boat.
---
damn! I wish! I work 12s so fortunately I get lots of days off in-between.
---
Vanilla raids were never difficult, raids are going to be on farm regardless of if they increase boss HP or not. Which they won't, because that would be stupid to make such changes.
---
Is there a guide for warriors like this for leveling
---
Hey guys Mr. Neil over here says it’s not important. Let’s just listen to him since he’s the clear voice for the classic community.
---
Dude, it’s important. Regardless of what you think.
---
I'm not sure what game you were playing but Horde were grossly outnumbered by Alliance in vanilla.  It was so bad that I'd want proof that even a single server was horde biased in vanilla.  
---
\&gt; Whether or not this was a large factor in people's choices is debatable, **but the fact is the Alliance had a far larger population during classic** ***WoW*** **than the Horde did. And this imbalance naturally created further problems.**
---
Dudes like you don’t know who Sony is? OG glad?
---
Even if you were right....
---
So.What?
---
Imagine worrying about website speed in 2019. Upgrade your internet man.
---
Sounds fair!
---
I bet if he pulled through to atleast level 13 or 14 he'd enjoy it. The feeling of progress and power is great when you unlock frost nova/poly, talent points reducing cast speed, and professions like first aid that have a huge impact on the gameplay. And all of the cool mage-unique things the class has.
---
Relics of a better time.
---
Fishing in Azshara was how I earned most of my gold back then. Stonescale eels always sold well, and the wreckage was always a nice bonus.
---
Day 1 is syllabus day. You got this.
---
You're either lying or a GM got it wrong. You can and have always been able to multibox in PvP.
---
I actually am still legitimately confused how it works in retail, I played at the tail end of Legion and I can't even figure out how it levels.
---
That being said what I will love the most is that First Aid will be back! Why the fuck did they remove it in retail?
---
NOW? Lol... it’s been a heap of trash since Cataclysm.
---
It's really a combinations of so many different variables.  More people starting play wow, and most of them were not "hardcore" gamers who could devote 12 hours a day to the game, also those hardcore gamers of the past started getting lives: jobs, families, kids, etc...  So the game became more casual-friendly since people wanted to get the same experience with less time invested.
---
Again, not a bag thing.
---
But couple that with the social changes over the years; and people being disincentivized to group, and you get less people grouping, along with playing less.  So now, the average player could complete the majority of the game by themselves without ever grouping with another player outside of dungeons, raids, or BGs.
---
Individually, all these changes were great: they made the game more accessible for a much wider demographic of players, and allowed WoW to grow as much as it did.  I just don't think anybody could ever foresee it getting to this point because of all the collective changes.
---
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, as you know...
---
Played in late Vanilla, like, BWL was out for a good while already when I joined. 
---
Managed to get a character to like level 28 and that's it, then TBC launched. I was young, only played Ragnarök Online and thus only winded up raiding properly in TBC and Wotlk.
---
As if you would turn down being paid to play games? LOL. Get off your high horse. You’re just salty they get paid to do what you enjoy to do, while you’re not getting paid.
---
True
---
You're either really young or delusional. Many games back in the day were unplayable on release due to game breaking bugs and never fixed. 
---
Also the end of your statement is just contradicting the first. Especially after your first reply. 
---
If those bugs are inconsequential why wouldn't developers put them further down the priority list?
---
New players will very much be at a disadvantage yes. Anyone who thinks different go watch Destiny's stream. The guy turns from a competent-seeming adult into a ball of suck with no self-confidence just by logging in. 
---
Having said that, I think it's legitimately a great game that's worth spending time on, especially if you're willing to sink the time into it.
---
Drain tanking is a leveling build popularized in TBC. It’s not that great in vanilla. What you’ll want to do is put 3 points in corruption so that the cast time is less than the GCD. After that you’ll go deep demonology. This makes it harder for you to die and your voidwalker taunt way stronger. Trust me, you’ll want improved voidwalker when you start quickly taking aggro off every mob after a couple seconds. 
---
At level 23 you will have his this build https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IcZbxhz
---
Fel domination is really great in pvp. Imagine a rogue opens on you with your voidwalker out. You can bubble and get them feared. They’ll kick you and stun you but the void bubble(that is stronger because improved voidwalker) keeps you alive long enough to fear. While he is feared you fel dom + summon voidwalker. Now you have a little bit of shield left and a new voidwalker to sacrifice to make another bubble if you need to. 
---
Once you’re at this point you want to go back into affliction. You’ll want instant cast corruption now that you’re getting into the level range of world pvp. It’s up to you if you want to go a little further in demonology for Master Summoner because that’s super strong but it’s up to you. Master Summoner + Fel Dom means you can have a 0 mana cost .5 second cast voidwalker summon. I usually go down affliction like this. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IAMbhRbkAZbxhz shadow mastery is a really great talent that boosts your dps and is great to have at 50. At this point you’re starting to get closer to respeccing for end game. SM/Ruin is the most common choice as DS/Ruin is harder to level/world pvp with. If you want to go DS Ruin just wait until lvl 58 or 59 or even 60. This will be your final build for leveling spec before respec to SM Ruin https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IAMbhRbkAZbxGzr
---
Boss HP in raids and dungeons. I'm wondering if they'll increase it higher than what it was in retail vanilla, because we all are way better at MMORPGs now.
---
Guess you never visited the forums. Any time a classic server was suggested in forums these people swarmed it with nasty replies and reports.
---
Are you really complaining how the gryphon flys?
---
Jesus, no wonder Blizzard didn't want to make Classic.
---
Makes sense as to why alliance had instant bg queues and horde had to wait 30 minutes.
---
Also makes sense as to why alliance got rolled and overwhelmed in wpvp.
---
Unless you are talking about alliance made more characters than horde maybe you played the different game.
---
Thanks for the reply. Was wondering if you could help clear something else up for me that I never understood. You've said in your comment that items from those raids are well itemized. I've heard numerous times that raids in Vanilla and TBC (i started in WotLK) didn't automatically invalidate the previous raid tier the way new raids do today. How does this work though? It sounds really good to me but like, I don't get it? Do the raids basically all drop similar level loot? Do people run the raids for enjoyment instead of the current gear treadmill that happens? Thanks for any replies!
---
.... dude I was 16! I don't have any SS because I had to restore my computer because of all the "pop ups"..
---
My job has enough down time I play while working...
---
Username checks out
---
This right here. Increasing the health of bosses won't increase the difficulty (especially for MC/BWL), only make clearing the raid more tedious.
---
What part of 'this is not feasible or sustainable from a business perspective' do you not understand? Blizzard will not release four different versions of WoW, period. It'll fragment the WoW community so much that it'll die off once people realise that their realms only have 50 concurrent players left on them.
---
Go play a private server if you really want to relive BC, I hope for your sake they actually maintain enough population to see BT
---
shortstack fetishes didnt exist in 2006
---
Asmongold wass also pulling numbers like this around BFA release, his 2nd highest Stream ever was when Warfronts released iirc. 
---
Also during the WF progress races WoW attracts a lot of viewers. Think Sco (GM of Method) had his best stream ever during Uldir Progress with 164K viewers. But also Methods coverage as a whole does every good each progress race. 
---
But Classic doing well now should be no no surprise. The big question will be, how well will Classic do 1-2-3 months after release. Will it still smash the numbers, or will ppl like Soda and Asmon be dividing between other games again.
---
That would be a CHANGE , you don’t want to say that on this community  , you wanted vanilla , you get vanilla , not vanilla 1.13
---
How is classic more complicated? classic player btw
---
How many hours per week do you game. That’s the real question. It’ll take every last minute you want to give it. Not a quick playthrough for sure.
---
The shots weren’t random. Retail has been trash for years now. The shots aren’t random. Blizz/ATVI took the greatest game of all time and perverted it into some sort of Cash-Grab-Every-Millenial-Gets-A-Trophy monstrosity. 
---
Look what they did to my boy..... We haven’t been outraged enough, tbh.
---
I totally disagree. Vanilla raids were *statistically* difficult. The tank's gear mattered a lot. The healer's gear mattered a lot. The DPS's gear mattered a lot.
---
Sure, the mechanics were easy, but the content was hard due to gear checks.
---
Buffing boss health does mean that people actually have to play the mechanics of the fights though.
---
For example, ragnaros almost NEVER sees a phase 2 on pservers. If they buffed ragnaros so that you couldn't just zerk him from launch, then at least players would have to properly do the fight. I'm not saying that phase2 is difficult or it's gonna make or break a kill, but getting to see the mechanics makes raiding much more fun.
---
Other examples:
---
Vaelstraz tank swap, Firemaw stack resetting, lucifron debuffs, cthun one weakness etc.
---
I think people (including game developers) overestimate the appeal of instant gratification, though. I mean, it's not like WoW got any more popular after they made these changes. And even back in vanilla, people were bitching about "accessibility" casual/hardcore whatever, but they still played the game. They were obviously still engaged with it, despite their complaints.
---
On a side note, I agree that MOBA communities are... difficult, but MOBAs themselves aren't exactly about instant gratification. They take a lot of patience and effort to learn, at least in my experience.
---
I just don't see why humans would have changed so fundamentally in just a generation. We're still basically the same as we were thousands of years go. Delayed gratification was satisfying for one generation, why should it be different for the next?
---
More dots more dots more dots.........More dots
---
For neat items Gnomish is pretty much all around better. Goblin can make sapper charges which are great for aoe raid damage,but those are boe.
---
Serious question, do you think classic is going to retain most of it's player base let's just say by November?
---
No, I don't think just because it takes longer means that it's difficult. I had thought it might be or might be perceived as such due to what I mentioned along with a number of second hand impressions I had of it so far. Just wanted to see what others thought.
---
I took off 3 weeks, my girlfriend thinks I'm crazy..
---
Arguing with silly people is never a good idea, so let's say you're right, have a great day buddy
---
That Chad ain't classic, look at that modern face!
---
Lol what idiot still visits the wow forums?
---
Beat me by 13 hours.
---
And there shouldn’t be the little red jump off button at the bottom
---
Nice! yeah actually feels great to have 4 weeks to grind as much as my body possible can.
---
Ugh, yeah. I remember the first time I tried to play Pong. The second paddle kept falling off of the screen and you couldn't get it back. I'd try some Pac Man, but the ghosts just phased right through the walls! It's a shame they could never fix those bugs and the games never took off because they were completely unplayable.
---
Just be glad you have actual friends to play with and not be a loser like that guy.
---
&gt;/cast !Auto Shoot
---
No it doesn't :/
---
Obviously misremembering.
---
Already tried, to no avail
---
Wow, great info. Sounds like I can play with graphics to maximize fps if needed and I can prioritize the refresh rate. Thanks!
---
&gt;Gear/stats don’t matter in retail. Only stat that matters is the ilevel of the gear. 
---
This isn't true
---
I'll consider it, that does indeed look insane.
---
lots of people did that
---
It will be allowed. You have to deal with it (Sadly). I will Multibox as well. With prob. 5 Shamans/Hunters :D
---
Yea you definitely can do it casually, and still could be fun, but it will take you a long, long...long long long time to level up or get to anything interesting or end game.
---
Tbh you are good to start ppl started playing wow since 2004-2019 so go for it ask questions and you will be fine. ^_^ GLHF.
---
Yeah 1080p is fine if I'm going 144Hz, so I would likely stay at 24", 27" at the most.
---
Der wolf no die in one hit, fail game
---
From a certain point of view, sure.  But many games changed themselves drastically over the years and appear to be completely different from their original iterations (Path of Exile and League of Legends, for example).
---
But what I was talking about was a complete reset of the entire game.  Something like  "15 years later" or something, where our characters are no longer the god-slaying, planet-saving champions we are, and we go back to being just your average joe adventurer trying to make a name for ourselves.
---
You can say that's what Classic WoW is doing, but I still want Modern to grow, and hopefully learn from Classic, but also from their own hindsight.
---
NO
---
I dislike multiboxers. It's always been accepted but I think that should be changed.
---
And that entire article talks about how horde is "unfinished" and the "bias" - has nothing to do with population but kay!
---
Rest in pepperonis
---
Not been to enough meetings staring at an Agile board with 500 sticky notes on a whiteboard, 2 idealistic business analysts, a burnt out project manager, product manager home with a sick kid, and 7 skeptical engineers at the table chugging Redbull. 
---
That’s Blizzard, Adobe, Apple and 8000 other software companies.
---
To be fair to Blizz, they've tried to remove water walking multiple times, but the community goes into uproar.
---
thanks for making the post about this OP, I would never have caught it, but now that you mention it, Beta gryphons seem so dead compared to actual Classic clips
---
Thats lvl 5 though minimum though
---
It's literally the only change I'd want though. I see it as necessary. Otherwise these bosses are goign to be such a joke.
---
I think the biggest insult to me was the locking of abilities and spells to certain specs. What even was the purpose of that? No, scratch that, the biggest insult was deleting melee from hunter unless you change your spec to be a melee hunter... I have never been so fucking triggered in my life.
---
The currently available WoW that you have access to play is NOT at all what WoW Classic is, as much as it's changed over these last 15 years the game is completely different and is just as you say.
---
My reccomendation, as a random internet stranger, is for you to wait and not play WoW until classic comes out Aug. 27th. 
---
I was 13 when I first played WoW when it came out, and while I wasn't a very good player, I still mastered the basics and REALLY enjoyed the game. Thus my point here is, current retail WoW is confusing, flashy, and inundated with a lot of concepts and knowledge not easily taught to a new adopter. Original WoW, Classic, was easy enough for a 13 year old to pick up so that makes me believe you wont have trouble.
---
kala (and now today finally, hydra) are my favorites. there's an assload of priests in the beta but i guess they arent as fun to play/watch for many people, or the streamer personality tends to not favor priests
---
Some of the parts are just old, but they do the job still. I never use the machine so I don't feel like upgrading what I don't have to, and it feels like classic won't need too much to do the job.
---
About tree-fiddy
---
I'm talking about RPG in term of gameplay, you know like RPG games where you level, gear up, do stuff that progress your character, etc.
---
You're deep in those mines.
---
Just one of those, everyone is hyped for this thing so i'm gonna go against the grain edgy posts.
---
Classic vague-booking, nicely done!
---
You actually think they are lying when they say theyve checked the reference client?
---
What parts that theyve confirmed do you think they are lying about?
---
And why would they lie? They dont gain anything from doing that.
---
Thanks for the info, yes 1080p sounds like where I need to stay. Deals pop up all the time, e.g. https://slickdeals.net/f/13081501
---
Nice try, Blizzard...
---
Well fuck me sideways and call me sally
---
Gear checks weren't really a thing either, other than resistance or tank gear. Knowledge and farming of consumables dramatically reduces the need for gear - see Tanks using potions for armour (and the rest) instead of a Shield. Change that to using a Shield AND a potion for early content with no gear and you end up basically in the same place.
---
People will be killing raids day 1 regardless of if they buff boss HP.
---
&gt; numerous times that raids in Vanilla and TBC (i started in WotLK) didn't automatically invalidate the previous raid tier the way new raids do today. How does this work though? It sounds really good to me but like, I don't get it? Do the raids basically all drop similar level loot? Do people run the raids for enjoyment instead of the current gear treadmill that happens? Thanks for any replies!
---
The way the raids were designed in classic is that each raid would still be run for SOMETHING even if a future raid had some nice new things. For example, Band of Accuria is so powerful that even with the nice items ZG/AQ20/BWL brought around people still ran MC to get their hands on it. That's true with things like Choker of the Fire Lord, some of the staves, etc. There's always *something* in the raid that make it alluring to go back to get.
---
The nice thing is that this works both ways too. Imagine you're AQ40 geared. Why would you do ZG if you have everything you need? Well, you want the ZG enchants, so you'll run ZG. If you're a new raider, you'll tag along these raids and get some of that nice gear while the older raider will get rep and items to turn in for enchants.
---
 People even kept running dungeons like UBRS and Dire Maul for stuff since some of the items in there will last you until BWL or even AQ40 depending on class/spec. DM also had world buffs that you could always do.
---
I'm going to have toon I play on my own.  Probably a priest that I can plan to raid with, if I'm lucky.
---
Hey mate you take that shit back, my bat is perfectly trained.
---
Absolutely right, just play WoW and become a streamer for the re-release of classic in 2030.
---
Hunters are a HUGE pain in the ass because of the pet/ammo management. Shamans are pretty dope though. If you want to do dungeons at 60 you’ll need a proper tank+healer.
---
Edgy.
---
Another C student who gonna spend their parents money, turn 35 some day, and realize they are only qualified to work at Walmart for the rest of their lives.
---
Hope it's worth it!
---
They could do that without buffing HP, just make it so instead of being on a timer it goes by boss % so it forces intermissions.
---
Than*
---
They had a TOTEM that did that, but as far as I can remember, they never had a talent.  Possibly in the early stages of WoW, but not in 1.12.
---
Well if the enemy has your flag, it makes sense that your rogue needs to do something other than guard your flag, eh?
---
Hopefully not because its technically not blizzlike cus people didn't have pcs/or software good enough. Multiboxxing in classic is actually more powerful than any other expansion.
---
I hope they will block it like raidfinder addon
---
What is great about vanilla is that once you hit Level 2, you can cast an additional fireball. So you really feel like your character progresses, because now you don‘t have to melee this wolf down, your character became strong enough to easily kill it with fireball spam.
---
That‘s why vanilla is awesome. You actually **feel** yourself getting stronger and stronger.
---
&gt;Hunters eat everyone while leveling
---
Ftfy
---
Good thing most of our guild dislike multiboxers like nothing Else and will dedicate our time to corpsecamp you :)
---
I hope this is true! If its an easy fix that can be popped out quick that would be amazing.  Too often I hear stories about how an otherwise simple problem is somehow tied to game-breaking core mechanics and an entire overhaul is needed in order to change the colour of a blade of grass
---
calling a privat server one original is pretty stupid
---
I remember when mana became infinite. At first I was reeeeal excited, then 20 minutes into questing, I thought, _'this really makes things kind of boring'-
---
So i'm not allowed an opinion? my opinion is that it's minor and doesn't affect gameplay nor does it affect immersion imo.
---
Just because I have a different opinion doesn't mean i can't voice it. If people with different opinions were shouted down and ridiculed classic coming back wouldn't be a thing.
---
My wife would have ZERO intention of being a main tank.  In fact, I think it's one of the things about modern raiding that's lost and a bit sad: there's not real room for an off tank.  It's just two mains swapping on some "i'll kill you if you don't swap now" mechanic.
---
TBC is a polarizing expansion because of Flying. but playing it right now I'm loving it. The heroics are amazing even though some are so difficult they require specific comps. 
---
PVP is still really exciting and vanilla-like with very short fights, but also has the flaw of druids and warlocks. 
---
Flying mounts and the world in general are just a ton of fun. It didn't kill world pvp, it just made it a  more rare. Primals, herbs, mining, Scryer mats all have to be farmed in the world, so you will always find people to fight. Even if they do fly away,   as a spriest I catch up with Riding Crop can kill most players by just DOTing them and watching them die. I can reapply the DOT midair and slowfall as well. 
---
I love how professions are borderline overpowered, with tons of fun engineering items added like super rocket boots, nigh invulnerability belt, rocket cannon trinket.  Tailoring and LW being super strong in PVE. Blacksmithing having insane BOP weapons. It's all great fun.
---
ITT: Lots of people who never post here are pissy.
---
I didn't know about the Coarse Stone market in particular but I was targeting mining to be my go to harvester for early money making. I'll be going Tailoring/Engineering for end game but will be going Mining/Engineering originally (I haven't played WoW in about 5 years but I'm pretty sure engineering uses mining mats to level). I'll drop mining for tailoring and pick it up on an alt.
---
because warcraft is classic+bfa+warcraft 3 reforged + movie
---
type something like battle for azeroth or world of warcraft
---
It's exactly the same except for the part where it was completely opposite.
---
You're mistaken, mis-remembering or something.  I backed it up with evidence.  Feel free to try the same if you can.  
---
Horde, on every server I ever heard of, got destroyed in world pvp because they had about 1/3rd the population of ACTIVE players.  Alliance BG queues were longer but they were guaranteed full parties.  Horde had quicker queues but frequently didn't have full parties.  Ironically because they were always outnumbered the Horde often fared better in even matches because they had to up their game to compensate for always being zerged.
---
The point of the sub is WoW Classic, which was created because shittons of people don't like Retail and quit WoW because we don't like Retail. The fact that this is now in question only points towards a huge influx of people coming to this sub recently, nothing else.
---
I am planning on leveling Tirisfal -&gt; Silverpine so maybe we will.
---
Who knows
---
Even some of my old friends are so desperate to make Classic seem like it's a bust. Meanwhile even super casual Wowcrendor is having a blast "leveling" by exploring (AKA doing a corspsewalk world tour lol). 
---
I was fine with Blizzard making changes to the game that made it a bit more convenient. It felt like the game was growing up with me. But now it's at the level of being practically a phone-app game. It's just boring, unrewarding, and riddled with mini games that do nothing but try to keep me logged in. Give me difficulty, give me a sense of accomplishment. Classic will be hard and suck at times, but when even the tiniest successes feel like amazing accomplishments, the struggles become worth it.
---
Private servers are correct on this one tho
---
Not clickbait but ok
---
Current beta pvp server is tipped towards horde
---
Because classic isnt released yet
---
is there a joke here I dont get
---
Legendary items became participation rewards that every single player would get their hands on if they attend their weekly LFR run. Worse yet they became so common that it was then a gear requirement to have your legendary before joining a semi decent raiding guild.
---
That's way way worse.
---
Are you serious? Of course the animations should be as they were. And yeah, the gliding was awesome.
---
Just bait then
---
Your jealousy is showing, dude.
---
Right now its a bit of guesstimate, next stress test I'll monitor boats/zeppelins for a while to get a more accurate averages
---
There's going to be a LFG addon and there's nothing Blizzard can do about it without breaking all the addons that were "must-haves" in Vanilla.
---
Mythic raids are much harder than vanilla raids. You can't expect to clear the raid if half of the raid-squad is incompetent.
---
Ironic I suppose because vanilla has been described by many as boring because of the grind.  I suppose the mechanics that have made it into retail did because they're supposed to make the game more "fun" and "approachable", even for normies.  My wife is a normie, and she hates retail WoW, but is taking days off for the Classic release so we can have fun together.  
---
She has no intention of main tanking in any raid capacity.
---
Do you remember the name of the totem offhand? Thanks!
---
You can't get Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer in IF tho.
---
time to find a new wife id say
---
Now tell us dishonestly
---
Stay right where you are!
---
Private servers got most of it right, even if they weren't perfect.
---
I think the fraction would be the most precise.
---
Lol you're so stubborn, good luck in your future conversations.
---
I mean....to each their own right?
---
I loved doing that quest chain. Best thing was being able to have multiple warlocks help each other out to save money!
---
Tbh none of the stuff I've seen so far is signficant enough that the game couldn't be launched in this state. Other than obviously the new layering system.
---
Healing stream totem.
---
Ahh.  But really I have a hard time believing that any level appropriate mob wouldn't die in 4 fireballs if you have appropriate ranks in it.
---
I tend to notice small details like this and noticed this too. It pains me the gryphons/wyverns don't tilt and turn like they did back then. Please report this to Blizzard if you can!
---
The time for the boat to full loop is static, so the theoretical average wait time is essentially half that.
---
Jealousy of what exactly? Him having no friends?
---
Fighting the boss as long as they did in vanilla* you mean.
---
We were behind the curve in AQ because of the event. Still close to top 10. World firsted a Loatheb in OG Naxx. I was 17 at the time. Also same.
---
Retail wow is closer to an action game than an RPG this is why everyone who likes classic prefers a slower paced game.
---
Raids will die day 1 by top guilds whether they buff HP or not. Full strats and prep are already known and practiced. Same as if Method went back and did old Mythic raids they've practiced and clear day 1.
---
Worry about yourself and your own guild
---
Considering it's the first version of the game, absolutely
---
kvlt
---
Imagine if downvotes where still a thing on the blizzard forums.
---
Yea, this is a really hard one for me.  
---
One, I played Druid Healer most of my adult life.  I know it and love it.  Part of me wants to continue that trend.  I also like the idea of being at the same point with her, level by level, quest by quest (including class quests).  
---
Another part of me wants to diversify a bit and try a new healer.  It'd also give me a rez, which would be nice.  I suppose the main loss would be in not being able to join her in class quests and sharing a sort of ... class camaraderie.  
---
I know I'm thinking about it too hard, lol, but that's what reddit is for imo, lol.  Yall can help me decide by having the discussing with me.  
---
I really appreciate it!
---
Troll racial is increased hp regen.
---
He or she obviously haven't played retail in quite a while.
---
Give it a go, great thing about wow (classic anyway, as far as i know) is that you dont need to be a pro to have fun. Even the experience of leveling is a journey and gives you plenty of time to learn the ropes.
---
Your opposing factions mom's dildo collection.
---
I miss the old stealth animations, I remember being angry about them changing it. Looked like my rogue had a stick up her ass ever since.
---
My feedback for you is; i believe you overestimate everyone's ability to raid. The vast majority of players won't see past AQ40 until way after it's been out.
---
Apparently druids can use travel form and roots inside. They shouldn't be able to. This needs to get fixed asap. https://clips.twitch.tv/ScaryVastCiderOSsloth
---
Blizzard trying to offer the true Classic WoW experience.
---
In the Beta, litterarely everyone loved me, Multiboxing and asked me for guides, there was only like 2-3 People, they got crushed by the Chat. So no clue, I think Multiboxing is pretty accepted it seems. Except if it goes for PvP, cuz it is super unfair.
---
Yeah ik. The reason I remember (or misremember) this talent is cause I thought that 10% increase and combat regen combined with this talent (which I think increased health regen 10% as well) would be so strong! Obviously it would amount to such a negligible number but what did I know?
---
You main the Heal right? I am not sure, how you Handle Tanking/DPSing then.
---
Stopped serious playing in WoD and its really sad to say, but since then i always feel like something is missing. I didn't manage to get into any other game meanwhile.
---
I'm just so hyped to get my favorite hobby for 10 years of my life back...
---
Hahaha why you hating? I was just trying to give you a good answer to your question. jeez
---
Ah ok. I’m thinking of something else that only increased the shamans passive health gain. Idk, either I’m misremembering or it must’ve been from much earlier in vanilla
---
Hi, /u/MaltaDuDe
---
The people who asked for this and whom you should be thanking. I'm not saying now, or even recently. People's resistance to anything classic existed for a very long time.
---
Also, a lot of us had to visit the classic forums to speak sense and make the case for NO CHANGES. The same people mentioned by the original post were trying to ruin it.
---
120 Dark Iron dwarf. Just speculating, but I bet this guy has every single in-store mount. We dont want them in OUR Azeroth!
---
Uphill both ways, in snow.
---
It never ceases to amaze me that people can complete fail to read written text, particularly when it's fucking bolded for them.  
---
Anyone that actually played in vanilla knows.  While I agree that it looks like WoW Classic will be Horde biased, at least to start, it's only because too many ignorant people have no idea what vanilla was actually like and are basing their choice on streamers or what the feel like the current state of the game.  
---
Regardless, you and I are talking about vanilla and you're astonishing ignorance and lack of reading comprehension.
---
Pretty much this, if you go all out and make a post about how mediocre you think Classic is..
---
Ah, shit, here you go again.
---
The worst one I remember is trying to go to tarren mill for the first time.   
---
swim trought the lake close to undercity for 10 minuts then dodge ogres in Alterac
---
Man, I never had these problems in Vanilla. We had one enhance Shaman and he still found a way to carry his own weight by being buffed 10x more than the rest of us with alchemy and cooking.
---
Like I said above, if it becomes a problem we’ll address it. Till then, I’ve seen MANY more guilds break up from totalitarian GMs than off-specs.
---
 How do install or add it ti blizz launcher ?
---
Feral was pretty much garbo for anything outside of leveling or world content.  
---
You were also correct in your assumption.  Druids didn't win fights because of their overwhelming damage.  They won fights through being untouchable and their superior mobility while whittling their enemies down with their dots.  It's certainly not the most exciting playstyle, compared to say, a rogue, or mage, but this was the most efficient way to play and win.
---
There is no shame in admitting that a playstyle is not for you.  Find something that you truly enjoy and stick with it.
---
Lol k. By the way, your anecdote =/= reality of the matter. Ally was always more populated than horde in total. Yes some servers were horde heavy but the opposite is true for ally as well. Battlegroups came close to closing that gap but overral population was always higher alliance. It's because they are the overpowered faction.
---
Something led to a massive drop in subscriptions shortly after Cataclysm and the game has never recovered.. Blizzard stopped releasing numbers after MoP. That's what I meant by killed. I'm curious what other people think because I have been putting a lot of thought into it and feel like 3.2.0 was the tipping point.
---
If you're leveling a rogue as an alt, here's the most underrated dagger I know:
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?item=2912](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2912) 
---
Usually cheap in AH since it gives intellect, huge top-end damage with it's 1.9 speed.
---
Do I smell some projection?
---
The room connected to flag room and balcony with the ramp in it
---
Its to catch the druid when he drops from roof, he has 3 options graveyard, ramp or tunnel, sitting in lobby covers graveyard and ramp, tunnel is covered by your teammates who are pushing through to roof which forces the druid to drop
---
The point is rogue camps lobby on defense and offense
---
&gt;Of fucking course it can happen even in WSG.
---
You literally cant be phased in a battleground.
---
Instances/battlegrounds are separate from the rest of the open world, so youll never be phased there.
---
My friends and I five manned it back in the day, in 1.10
---
Comp was  Prot Warrior, Resto Druid (Me), Frost Mage, Combat Rogue, SL Lock.
---
We were very geared, BWL and a bit of AQ, Prot warrior had a Tfury.
---
You get all the important CC (various Warlock pets + fear, Sap, Sheep, Hibernate). If your tank is great, threat isn't much of an issue, and if your healer is a druid you can pop into bear form when Rend Blackhand decides to turn on you, mage has block, warlock is a warlock, rogue is a rogue.
---
I'm pretty sure we balled out and used flasks, but probably didn't have to. It was not that challenging of a time, and since we didn't need to do it again, we didn't. 
---
We did 5 man Strat constantly because we wanted the Baron's horse, which we didn't get.
---
I don't know if a random group of tier 2 folks would have that good of a time trying it, communication is probably even more important than gear. If someone doesn't get the CC right, or plays unwisely, you're going to die. I do not think it would be feasible for very exceptional players to do it without at least a solid amount of raid gear, but probably with a bunch of consumables/worldbuffs it could be done.
---
&gt;While I agree that it looks like WoW Classic will be Horde biased, at least to start, it's only because too many ignorant people have no idea what vanilla was actually like and are basing their choice on streamers or what the feel like the current state of the game. 
---
And thank you for agreeing with my first post.
---
You riled yourself up and look stupid, congratulations!
---
I think you'll find that most of the target audience for classic are millennials so I'm not sure where you're going with that..
---
Millenials have a birthyear between the early 1980s and the late 1990s (depending on who is defining it).  So basically the people who were in middle school, high school, and college when wow first came out.  These are the ages where gaming is most prevelant, so you could say vanilla was designed for millenials.  
---
You might be talking about Gen-Z?  The people who are in middle school, high school, and college now are gen-z.
---
I completely agree that flying mounts were terrible for WoW - TERRIBLE.
---
When asked what my best gaming memory is - The first 10 minutes on my flying mount in Shodowmoon.
---
How do we reconcile these two things?
---
Who would have thought, some people liked vanilla and some don't. Damn them for expressing opinions I disagree with!
---
....gib
---
Well you can’t even get to maps in 4 hours so you probably haven’t played the game enough to even understand it...
---
Well, I wasn't a paladin in vanilla, the other faction actually. The biggest hurdle is that you don't have a taunt, so if you lose control it's hard to recover. Allot depends on your group hitting the right target.
---
Otherwise, the talent tree is great, and you have the good player optimization. Reckoning seems to be a key feature, unlike tbc (when I did tank as a pally) where people often skipped reckoning.
---
It's not as good as a warrior or druid, but it's totally doable. I know lots of people also did it as 30/21, where u can grab sanctuary which does great threat.
---
ToC is a common point people refer to as the 'turning point' for the game.  So pretty much right when you say.
---
Good thing I dropped out :) 
---
:c
---
Not really a big event imo. I guess after having played vanilla for so many years now I see my burnout levels and play time as a consumable. I'm going hard on classic and wouldn't want a beta to tarnish my experience or take away from my play time. That and I don't have the time to focus in on bug testing.
---
i agree. i guess it's possible if he got really unlucky with resists, and i won't go and say level 1-3 is the pinnacle of game design, it's not... but it doesn't last long. at all. after a certain point you should know when it would be faster to smack the wolf instead of casting one more fireball, and very soon after that, you get to the point where you can finish wolves off with your spells and your wand instead of smacking the wolf.
---
it's not the most engaging gameplay in the world, but it is rather silly to not even get to level 5 and expect it to be the same as the rest of the game. i wouldn't get to level 3 in current and go ''well, this must be what the whole game is like'' so ridiculous
---
This is a beautiful meme.

What a truly awful name.

Some heroes were born to defeat the void lords.

Some heroes were born to help gather the ingredients to make Goretusk Liver Pie.

 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Also If you join a Battleground while on a Gryphon you spawn in the Air after leaving the BG and fall to your death.
---
&gt; why would they lie? They dont gain anything from doing that.
---
They gain not having to do the work, or letting us know that it's impossible to recreate and getting a bad reaction. Also do we even know for sure that their reference client is absolutely correct in everything? After all it's just a private server, the only difference is blizzard is hosting it with the original code, it could absolutely have incorrect values because it's some frankenstein server mixing modern and old code.
---
wrorst place to post this my guy
---
Yes shamans usea to have regen talent. It was 31 point talent in enh tree and it was really bad. Cant remember when it was replaced
---
I main the tank and use isboxer to do mouseover heals. Isboxer has a thing that basically shows a copy of your healers party frames on your main window and let’s you do your mouseover heals with it. 
---
You could also just macro your main heals to party 1-5 but that’s kind of a pain. 
---
It’s not that difficult to dps heal and tank all at the same time once you get the hang of it, especially in classic where dps rotations can be 1 button.
---
In it's simplest form, it does just that. Anyone that sees "LFG X" in any chat will automatically put that person in the system for all to see, no matter where in the world they are (or what character they're on).
---
But with the addon, you have more control over how you put yourself in the system. You can choose your role and the dungeons you want to queue for, all with a couple clicks.
---
Also with the addon, you're able to inspect players gear and talents and how many previous times the addon has seen that person complete dungeons along with a simple social upvote/downvote score that decays over time.
---
Auto-invite, queuing from an alt, voting on the social karma system, and finding a raid will only work if you have the addon.
---
It's perfectly natural to have a bent staff, don't worry about it.
---
If you live in the United States it releases on the 26th
---
Blizzard is the only one who can ruin Classic, if they give in to short-sighted complaints by BFA players. The retail players can (and will) complain, but by themselves they are powerless. Same as back in Wrath, really. Players were complaining, but Blizzard screwed up by giving in.
---
Whatever you say dude lol
---
"That's your opinion, but the reality is my opinion"
---
Lmao you're an idiot
---
Where to then my dude
---
Try with the correct spelling
---
    /cast !Auto Shot
---
Or Alliance...
---
So TBC and WoTLK were basically perfect extensions of Vanilla.  they added 10 new talent points, and new spells at max level.  But Blizz knew they could not keep doing that with each xpac.  Eventually it would just become a jumbled mess of talent points and spells.
---
Cata was the first time they REALLY changed things.  The squished the talent trees down, and forced a restriction on players that once they chose a tree, they could not put points elsewhere until they put enough 
---
 (21?) points into that tree. This forced restriction effectively killed old niche hybrid builds and is when you stopped seeing people playing their "class" and started playing their "spec."
---
This combined with the massive changes to old Azeroth alienated tons of old school players, which is why you tend to hear most people quitting around this time.
---
Isn’t there a boss in MC you need to banish a bunch of elemental adds?
---
I've played Guild Wars 2, Tera, RPG MO, Trove, till endgame in the past 3-4 years and I love all of them.
---
I think GW2's pvp and Tera's pvp is better than wow's.
---
I think Trove's grind and RPG MO's grind is better than wow's.
---
Leveling in those 4 games is fun to me, and wow leveling is tedious to me.
---
&gt; they lack an understanding of what purpose these concepts originally served. 
---
I think you are just being opinionated. If you like the game that's fine. But saying something like "all modern MMOs are bad" is just immature. There are hundreds of good MMOs out there, and they have big, active player bases, since people love these games that means the problem aren't other MMOs, the problem is within you. If you can't enjoy anything, it's your problem, not the game's problem.
---
not here, there are a ton of people who hate streamers so you’ll get a lot of hate
---
Define "quality of life"
---
Do you also want dungeon finder?
---
Good god people on both sides are so toxic. People screeching and whining about retail are no better than people screeching and whining about classic. Both have some weird sense of superiority that needs to die. Just play the one you enjoy playing and shut the fuck up
---
I also prefer oneshotting stuff while leveling, that's so much more fun! Oh wait, it is not
---
I have this and it's been so handy for the beta
---
This is honestly the biggest thing. A macro that casts auto shoot but does not cancel it.
---
Works awesome for me. Moving jobs with a flexible schedule. I get to quit my job to play classic and get a new job... when I want to start making money again
---
Light side always more populated than dark side... people want to go to heaven.
---
How does that come into play when OP asks what faction is going to be dominant?
---
Horde will have the flock of nerds that want to "go against the grain" while alliance will just have the flock of nerds that want to "crush the horde while being on a PvE server"
---
To think that it mattered which faction was OP in vanilla is dummy dumb -
---
 Horde was immature kids and Alliance were successful mature adults... right? 🤔
---
Do you remember when Super Mario Bros. had to be patched because every time you brushed up against a pipe you died from the piranha plant hitbox overstepping its bounds? Ouchie.
---
They're talking about how the skybox and lighting is wrong in SM on beta, the skybox is supposed to be green while the world should be dark and spooky looking.
---
Orcs are better for pvp because of the stun racial
---
The reference is not mixing anything, its identical to the old 1.12 client + server.
---
I'm not sure when exactly it happened but at some point all the flight paths got totally porked on live. I think some of the ones in WoD STILL fly straight through mountains and shit and go on a perfect line between two points.
---
I hardly doubt new content following the line of classic will ever be made, or if made will ever be successful.
---
The reason lies on few points:
---
\- Target audience: classic is not aimed to people that want something new. they went up to reintroduce bugs and system limitations to the game and it was even considered debateable technical limitations due to current state of the game ( like being able to trade items in raids so there is no need to make a ticket). This might change over the release of the game, but even so it's a consideration that will be done in much later terms and might even not be enough strong to be considered.
---
\- Development team: if we consider the above point not a problem, then there is also to be considered that the actual dev team is not one that develops new things, rather they try to replicate and recover things. this means different set of challenges from creating new content from the game. They lack an unified vision of the end result, artists and writers that share such vision and as such the team will be too much small to add remarkable content to the game.
---
\- If they decide to add things, if they have some kind of vision, then the first most probable addition they would ever make to the game is quality of life changes, like having soul shards stack and so on. And the game needs MASSIVE quantities of that. Also there is the totally reasonable philosofy to add to the game things that players add with addons, which might invalidate the target audience ( whoever thinks that people will quest without questhelper is delusional). As such, the first block they have ever to overcome, other than balance, game design, narrative et cetera it's also what to touch and what to ignore, knowing it will not solve the problem.
---
Back to work? I don’t know about you but work lasts all year. Have to find time for what you like to do..
---
Yeah I wish they’d release it now or sooner. I think they should end the beta soon and iron out any wrinkles and release the game. They have the hype right now but it’s up in the air if the train will still be rolling come August
---
It is the correct one. UD rogues didn't tippy-tap while in stealth.
---
Ah, before trolling was a thing, we had genuine satire.
---
Not sure what your problem is. So go fuck yourself.
---
There's no point in creating a character in classic if you are employed.
---
I played WoW in vanilla as a druid and am interested in the phenomenon of people getting excited about Classic. By pure coincidence I started playing WoW on live again recently, and have been enjoying it. I'm impressed by the ways they've improved the game. I never left WoW because it got worse, only because I wanted to focus on other things in my life at the time.
---
People play private servers because vanilla is a better game than retail. That's all there is to it. Not to preserve a classic game. So you are wrong in your initial assumption what wow classic is about in the first place. Of course people actually want a wow 2 in the spirit of vanilla, one just as good (or better) than wow with all the same good game design choices and not the shit they served with the expansions. No one want's to do the same content again and again if it isn't for other benefits.
---
NoChanges is important, but only because you can't trust today's Blizzard devs by default. Once they have proven themselves they should be allowed to add content very carfully. Ideally Oldschool Runescape is the blueprint to follow. 
---
If there are enough people that want to play on dead post naxx servers they can just clone the servers to make classic+, i agree with that.
---
Well, it's running on an entirely new tech stack, because they obviously can't bring back the old one, so it's different for sure. We just don't know if it affects anything in game or not.
---
Almost flunked 2nd semester of med school due to vanilla. I know the feeling.
---
I'd say this would be good advice if other quality servers weren't available.
---
Don't think this ever disallowed if you followed the "No Automation" rules. 
---
I also don't really see the issue, there won't be a lot of multiboxers with 5+ account setups. Also you should easily beat them in organised PVP, just don't go in 1 v.s. 5+ but in equal number encounters a organised group should always beat the multiboxer.
---
Except the part you failed to read...  and actual history.  
---
Blizzard had to add a pretty race and match classes for each faction to even attempt to balance it but it still took time.
---
agreed. if people were already doing it themselves with relogging, and were presumably going to keep going it, no reason not to add that button. it's not a giant gameplay change.
---
I'm sure Blizzard wanted as much time as possible to polish Classic before it's released.  They also kind of dug themselves into a hole by saying that it would be released in the summer.  August 27 is about as late into the summer that they could go while keeping that promise.
---
People take time off for expansion releases anyways, so Classic release really isn't that much different.
---
What do you mean back to work? Who doesn't work year round? I think the timing is perfect, the kids will be back in school, and I can take a week vacation to veg out. 😀
---
Those guides had actual useful information and tables in them.
---
My dad still has the original for TBC as well. Should check it out.
---
You want people to fight the boss the same duration as people who were generally awful at the game and had no clue about the gear they used?
---
That's silly reasoning.
---
No one is forcing you to play.
---
Double homicide kill the beat and the verses.
---
Your point about the past doesn't matter. 
---
Enjoy playing your paladin or undead rogue nerd.
---
"Its fucking payo duuude"
---
I'd rather it be what people wanted: the closest preservation as possible to the 2004-2006 game. If it goes well they can expand into other expansions if the demand exists. At the very least they can reset occasionally and let people play again. People have been playing private servers for the last 10 years, there will be demand for a long time.
---
Good luck on convincing Blizzard to staff a second version of their MMO instead of running a skeleton crew that occasionally needs to restart the server.
---
Millenials bad
---
You run because by the time the 2nd wolf is dead you have no mana and 20% hp
---
RemindMe! 96 days “do this!”
---
Pretty sure it's allowed to play on a pvp server, but you cannot do actual pvp.
---
I agree, the late summer release was kinda a let down. But i’d rather get to play it late and not be encounting bugs n stuff
---
And yes getting camped is a possibility in pvp servers but You can always play pve
---
Good thing we also have old videos which we can use as references, like with mob damage.
---
What do you think they have lied about so far?
---
As someone who played a combat dagger specced rogue in vanilla in a server first guild, I can say I frequently topped our damage charts and almost always topped the sword rogues.  I also had a bit of help with decent drops.
---
It would get boring if it was on Naxx forever, yes. That's why you restart occasionally.
---
The simple version is: Don't be a dick. Don't roll on a good ranged weapon upgrade if there is a hunter that needs it and you don't need it as much. Pay attention to your team. Roll on shit that's an upgrade for you, but be reasonable. If it's a side grade for you but a massive improvement for your teammate, let them have it.
---
I didn’t say you needed to be horde for the “downvote me you insecure hunchbacked weaklings” part
---
You played yourself.
---
The train has been going for a while now, I think we can wait a few more months. Blizzard has had worse delays in the past.
---
I encountered a couple of layering and "continuity" issues during the stress test on the stress test realm.
---
1.  Guards in Orgrimmar are randomly either male or female.  I clicked a male guard that randomly and instantly turned into a female.  This happened right near the entrance to the Valley of Honor area of Org.  Also, after randomly disconnecting and reconnecting, some of the guards had sex change operations and were of the opposite sex after the reconnect.
---
2.  I ran an undead to the zepp to get to Orgrimmar.  I had a couple of travel companions on the zepp as it left Tirisfal but when Durotar loaded I was on a zepp with a handful of different players.  
---
I understand the long term goal of layering is to assist the launch and prevent an abundance of dead realms in the long term but these things should not sacrifice the feel of a cohesive world (of warcraft).
---
I dont hate the answer. I just hate you for basically cheating in an mmorpg
---
well people will resub now for beta access (even just to have the chance) and stay subbed until the classic release. from a business standpoint it’s very smart of them
---
The secondary monitor can be small. Its just for browsing Reddit.
---
I feel you on the age point, I’m excited but also realize I start my trade school on the 28th so idk what gonna happen
---
The funny thing is he's posting this as a fresh Dwarf Warrior character, so i think he's already made his mind up.
---
I think you’re seeing two different levels of stealth, as you level as a rogue I believe there are 3 levels of stealth, each increasing movement speed while stealthed.
---
So you have the Naxxramas rogue with the highest level of stealth which I believe is 60% movement speed, and the barrens rogue with 40% movement speed, thus the visual difference.
---
He/she’s not wrong. It’s the reason why people want to play classic because the accomplishment when you finally can kill a wolf by spell alone, then kill one without having to drink afterwards. 
---
No one should be under any illusions, the grind will be long and hard. It should be long and hard, if blizzard is to learn anything from the beta, is to slash the experience gained in half because people are getting to thirty on quests alone.
---
I got one character to level 60 a month before tbc hit, been playing since eu release. It was awesome.
---
Official = visibility and stability.
---
Go back to retail, zoomer
---
All staff sizes and shapes are okay, dont let them tell You otherwise
---
and just in time for winter tho
---
Nice
---
Currently in the Beta the Gnomish Cloaking Device removes you from combat, dropping aggro with any mob that is attacking you. Theoretically I think you could use this with jumper cables or a regular rez to avoid corpse runs in a dungeon when a wipe is imminent. 
---
According to wowwiki [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Gnomish\_Cloaking\_Device](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Gnomish_Cloaking_Device) it should not work this way. It says  "Useful for escaping an approaching enemy or sneaking up on one that hasn't seen you yet."
---
Also according to a comment from patch 1.12 on wowhead classic ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4397/gnomish-cloaking-device#comments](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4397/gnomish-cloaking-device#comments)) it should not drop aggro with a mob already in combat with you. Other comments from later patches suggest this was a change made later in the game.
---
Vanilla WoW was the direct cause of so many college dropouts. You are in good hands.
---
lmaoo not sure if meme
---
Care mostly about pvp.
---
Play on 100 ms ping.
---
Need something not boring to play.
---
Stuck between Mage, Lock, Rogue.
---
Yet another reason why this subreddit is so important. Thanks for bringing this to light.
---
Fact still stands. Judging from the wsg matches the streamers are playing, enemies appear to be phasing in when, let's say sodapoppin reaches alliance Berzerking hut and the alliance are right there and have been there for a bit.
---
Ahh thank you! If you remember the name please lmk, I will have to keep searching. But it’s good to know I’m not crazy!
---
It's not just that it's also not a funny nor interesting clip.
---
Rotation on older exps was almost meaningless, it was much more important having patience, having a method on farming consumables and watheve rmight be needed, being knowledgeable of such factors and so on.
---
I mean, hell, even the build did not need to be good.
---
Probably the most important thing to know is to keep a good awarness of the fight, since there aren't many sensors as we have in newer expansions.
---
It's a game from 2004, I think you can run it well
---
Honestly it’s probably for the best, allows some players to be casual rather than hardcore, and focus on something (I know) more important than classic.  
---
But thankfully I’m done with school so fuck y’all :P
---
You cannot even have a ranged weapon and a staff/sword/... equipped at the same time.
---
Are you sure thats not the characters just getting into visual range?
---
Could you link one of those videos?
---
Huh? It’s perfect for me as a workin man. All the kids gotta go back to school and I can enjoy my 3 weeks off. Can’t you decide yourself when to take  a vacation?
---
No, neither of those make it official. It's perfectly stable and the only reason it's not visible is because it was made by a normal guy with no audience, rather than assmongol, dicksout or escuck.
---
Sure, but the genre isn't going to get better if we don't learn from the past.
---
Additonal content doesn't have to be powercreep. I agree post naxx content should take a very long time, doesn't mean you can't add other meaningful content.
---
[wowclassicbis.com](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) is a pretty good site for that
---
in the sense I can do 1-60 in a few hours on retail it takes a week or 2 in classic
---
The answer is "I love classic and I despise retail, so everything about retail is bad"
---
This is the best answer. It's totally true about where the difficulty was.
---
We have references sure, I'm just wondering if they are actually using old references, or just assume their server is correct in everything.
---
I don't think they have lied, but if they're only comparing with their reference server, I don't think that's good enough.
---
You are right, when I first started playing WoW in 2006 I hated it, so much that I quit the game for a month. I leveled a Undead Mage to level 6, saw people with pets, did not really like the Undead starting zone and made a human Warlock. As a noob it was a huge struggle to just to level 12 and the voidwalker quest took me forever to complete. I remember dying 10 times a quest in Westfall trying to kill defias and murlocks. I quit because it was so damn hard for someone who had never played an MMO. A month later I had met some friends at work who all played and talked about it on their shift. I told him I quit because I died every 3 minutes and he goes, "Dude, roll a Paladin, they never die. They can heal and bubble, you will love it." Went home that night, made a Paladin and learned how to play the game. Took about 2 months to hit 40 on him and learned a lot about the game itself. Soon after I quit my Paladin because I really wanted to play Horde and made an Orc hunter who I took at 60 and raided MC, ZG, BWL and AQ20 with. Once my guild broke up I made a Gnome Mage and quickly leveled it to 60 in about 3 weeks and did the same raids. I was addicted as hell to the game and made alt after alt for a while until BC came out.
---
I'm not alone..
---
&gt;  Most people just go afk during flight paths anyway?
---
Yeah, I switch to my web browser every time.
---
99.9% of people didnt see this loading screen in classic lol
---
Git gud
---
I was in mid to late college when it first dropped and still agree with his assessment. I’ve also played many other MMORPGs including most of the wow expansions. Nothing touches the late Vanilla or TBC era for me, either.
---
It has? If you are in the IsBoxer Discord maybe you can throw me a Message there :D
---
See thats the problem. We are both in felwood farming essence of water. I attack him cuz u thats what you do on a limited ressource pvp server. So he is allowed to fight back and one shot me with 5x frost shock?
---
True but the streamers might burn out being locked to thirty and they’re some of the games biggest advertisers. Asmongold esfond and staysafe were all talking about this exact point. Sorry I don’t have a link. On mobile at work
---
\&gt; Hunters are gonna roll on my swords and daggers, I’m rolling on their guns and bows.
---
Thats fair game then, but the situation of OP can't be compared. While I as a warrior will only get stats upgrade from a range weapon upgrade, a Hunter will gain DPS too. So for him it's going to be a bigger % upgrade automatically.
---
Unlike if I exchange Plate -&gt; Leather it doesn't matter as it will be the same % upgrade (if both have an item with the same stats).
---
How does that makes the game mediocre though?
---
I meant them giving a comment on whether there was any nerf to dungeons and if they took if/when this change happened into account in their accurate data. Like I mentioned, mob damage would still be "100% correct" if they nerfed the dungeons because that would still be their own, real data.
---
\&gt;  And thank you for agreeing with my first post.   
---
Not sure I can expect you to understand what other people say when you apparently can't comprehend what you wrote.  
---
\&gt; You riled yourself up and look stupid, congratulations!   
---
I'm not sure how your reddit works but mine shows me numerous people laughing at how moronic your statement was.  
---
Serious question - were you dropped on your fucking head head repeatedly?
---
It's not about the duration, it's about seeing the mechanics of the fucking boss.
---
But sure, can also make the timers earlier if that satisfies you.
---
That's pretty much my feeling about it. If you don't be that element of the game you should really stick to a PvE server.
---
I remember if you cast invisibility on yourself it would make the griffon you were riding invisible too.
---
Also, EQ2 was fun.
---
Visual range should be pretty much across the field as I've linked in that super old video.
---
The visual range has to be bugged, the way it is in the beta.
---
And I haven't got a clip from the streams. Its happening to both asmongold &amp; soda AFAIK. It doesn't look right.
---
That's why it's the beta. Good catch, OP.
---
Tristfal? Figured the all knowing Bran could spell
---
You're making yourself look very foolish
---
I prefer the new personally. If you go faster, it makes sense if your legs move faster.
---
It's okay to be upset.
---
Pretty sure multiboxers are just not allowed to engage or defend in pvp.
---
Im really curious about whether this will be true or not. If so, than only by the 5% playerbase.
---
Aggro management. That shit was a real issue for a lot of people in classic. There’s a reason most guilds required KTM.
---
Well, I seriously doubt they are bringing in a large amount of people compared to the amount of people that are all ready awaiting classic. I think it will do fine without them, especially because it will be rolled into the regular sub
---
Git gud or git dead
---
LOL, now I can definitely tell you spend a lot of time on those forums. 
---
Nothing of any importance is talked about over there and most of the time its a bunch of children crying and circlejerking over things that don't matter
---
These aren’t accurate comparisons at all. In the beta you’re using rank 1 stealth and are not spec’d into anything to improve your stealth ability. In the 1.12 footage you’re max level (assuming you’re using the highest rank of stealth) and seeing as you have hemorrhage on your action bar you’re heavily spec’d into the subtly tree more than likely maxing out every stealth improving talent available.
---
Back to work? Who stops working?
---
You have 0 clue about Vanilla gearing
---
it might be yeah. but I'll still prioritize #nochanges over some potential game design optimization
---
BFA is there for them.
---
You hate me? Hehe you’re really going to hate me if we wind up on the same server 😊
---
Whats the implication? Mana should be unlimited? Spells should one-shot anything? You should never have to fall back to your staff at low levels?
---
Chad is from Wrath and Var'jun is from Cata. Get this non-classic shit out of here
---
You dont always have organised pvp groups while mining ores in winterspring. But ok, u see the fairness in him paying 50 bucks a month to insta kill anyone trying to farm in winterspring, why would anyone dislike that??
---
When was the last time WoW was on the front page for the second week running?
---
Ok, but one could also post: “logged into retail. Gathered the same fifty mobs I killed for the last 200 days. AOE blasted them to death. Received chest. Opened chest. Received loot. Yay epics. Not sure what they are, but GS is higher, so equipped same. Joined LFR. Ran through instance in 20 minutes. More epics. Joined guild mythic run. Couldn’t faceroll because nobody knew how to actually play their character, so took 45 minutes. Very frustrating.”
---
Can’t tell if satire or actually serious.
---
Children like yourself?
---
The mechanics were seen 14 years ago, if people care they'll slow down. PvE isn't and never was difficult, these days it's used gear up for PvP or Naxx speed runs.
---
I see what you mean. Tbh, I'm excited for the gameplay of Vanilla, that's why I'm coming back. I agree with the original animations being better. It seems like some animation work is missing from the beta gryphon.
---
I played on the stress test a few days ago. It behaved exactly as he described.
---
Fuck that shit. Some of my best PvP has happened because shitty Flight paths. 
---
Story Time:
---
I was flying from north Eastern Kingdoms to south. I had a layover in Korgath. There was a 60 ret pally just killing NPCs on the outskirts. I was landing this was what he was waiting for a lowby to gank. Little did he know. I a lowly level 50 Orc Warlock, was ready. He charged. And I went straight to work. Fear dot dot dot. He ran around like a stupid child. But the fear broke and he came back. Slamming my poor baby face with his mighty hammer. He stunned me and blew his load... of spells get your minds out of the gutter. I survived the onslaught some how. I got a fear off again I threw up siphon life and drain life and I dragged myself back from the brink of death. Another fear caused him to pick up guards. A blessing and a curse. Fear kept breaking. He closed on me there was  little I could do. Just strafe and cast. Another stun stopped me. A bubble cleared his aggro and the dots. Was this it? No I came out barely a sliver of life popped my Health stone I had forgotten about. And again a fear sent him running. The 10 levels were daunting, with all the missed spells and the massive health pool. But with some luck and  the guards I fought back the Alliance coward. With his mana gone and being harried by guards, my dots ticked away his life. 
---
TL DR 
---
Shitty Flight Paths have lead to great PvP. One of which I killed a 60 Pally on my 50 Warlock.
---
What else could they possibley compare to that is more correct than a reference server which is a literal 1.12 client?
---
I'm just curious what people would like to see if we were to get content
---
lel
---
Yeah, you get it. Seems like a lot of people in this thread don't understand/remember how much of vanilla wow was about guilds progressing through raid content. Pretty much EVERYTHING you did, besides PvP, was an effort to make your guild stronger for raids.
---
Raids were the carrot at the end of the stick.
---
If they make raids too easy, which is what will happen if there's no boss hp buffs, then guilds will clear all the content within a month,  the carrot is gone, and then people will stop logging in.
---
We already see it happen in private servers and that's already with buffed hp, but those players are also good. But it would even happen casual/semicasual players if they didn't buff the boss hp.
---
Class mechanics have changed almost completely, some classes even use different resources. There is no training anymore on retail, no talent trees, no weapon skills, no spell ranks.
---
On retail you can use only one type of weapon, on Classic both melee and ranged. There are no reagents anymore nor ammo.
---
The zones also are different, changed in Cata, some more, some less, most quest chains changed. Thousand Needles submerged, Darkshore destroyed, green in the middle of Desolace, Barrens split in two and so Stranglethorn, Tanaris flooded, and later on Teldrassil burned and Silithus destroyed.
---
Stormwind has a harbor, some boats added in BFA and some replaced with portals. Tons of flying paths added and you don't even have to discover them all anymore.
---
So no, you can't learn anything useful about Classic by playing retail.
---
&gt; You can learn about rotations and spell priority. You can learn about spell interrupts and CC.
---
In case you never played an MMO before, it's much better to learn these things in Classic, where people will actually talk to each other.
---
6 days?! The casual is strong in you. It makes me sick! 
---
I'll get back to work the first of october.
---
People aren't more offensive than they used to be back then, people are more easily offended than they were back then.
---
Cargo cult thinking. Other mmo's imitate it because they saw it work, but they dont know why it worked. So ultimitely it isn't the same. Matt collvile on youtube explains it well if you want to know why its called that.
---
Old videos, which should be the first point of reference whenever it's feasible.
---
Has it only been a week!? Ugh, this is going to be a cruel summer.
---
Nah it existed in earlier talents, prior to the talent tree we have now.
---
he doesn't know.
---
It's situational DPS for sure, but there are fights where Warriors and Rogues use ranged weapons.
---
I’m not, but mirai made a video explaining it and he does a much better job at it than I possibly could :p
---
https://youtu.be/Mizu6e6BEno
---
Don't think rules like that have ever been official on live servers. From what i know its always been allowed as long as you weren't botting (one keypress is one action rule). I've seen pservers have different rules though concerning multiboxing.
---
Idk about that. WoW wasn't fundamentally very similar to EverQuest when it released. Hell, people saw Vanilla as a "casual" EQ clone back then. That didn't seem to matter in the end.
---
The next big MMO will be the one that really understands what made WoW popular, and improves on it. I don't think it needs to be completely different.
---
Don't care about this given that I'll be afk or minimized during flight but y'all got my support for those who want it changed.
---
And do what exactly? Get rid of LFG/LFR? That's not going to happen.
---
Yeah, cause reviewing a game in the first mob you kill is the right way to do it. Glad those type of players arent joining us tho.
---
Thy :D
---
Thanks for letting us know your point of view of classic. Why are you even here if you dont like the game though?
---
It can be interpreted both 2 ways, but whatever you say cowboy.
---
Yes, and you can't be phased in battlegrounds, so settle the fuck down.
---
I always figured this is why it was called “endgame” content. It was for people who finished the main part of the game, which was leveling.
---
Why is a 100g fee criminal? They put in a ton of work to be able to craft that pattern, something only 2 others out of 10,000 accomplished as well. Seems like a reasonable ask to me. Way cheaper than leveling smithing yourself, certainly.
---
Literally unplayable
---
The logo looks like a really bad rip off mobile game add
---
I guess so. People still talk in retail and there are people that will be assholes in Vanilla.  We are going to see a huge exodus of retail players into this game so even though the interactions and community will be much better, assholes will still be everywhere.  
---
I realize the games are very different now, but I think playing retail will provide more insight versus not playing at all.
---
Mained a nightelf dagger rogue to end of naxx.  Dagger rogues do equal dps to sword rogues until aq40.  It depends more on the players skill and attention to detail and preparation.  Dagger rogues are strong in mc with perditions, but there is a dearth of daggers until aq40.  Aq40 is when the sword rogues have an advantange with the increased need to move around as melee.  Dagger rogues got weapons faster than sword rogues on my server.  Even in Naxx, dagger rogues stay competitive.  I would suggest choosing your weapon spec based upon the playstyle you want.  Daggers have bigger crits, less spammy, and require more movement.  Sword rogues are better world farmers, more spammy, and compete with warriors and hunters for upgrades.
---
Ok, I’ll explain this one further..
---
Official from Blizz will always be more visible. I don’t care if the guy hosting this site is the most popular streamer or pro gamer or whatever. Random new people looking for WoW forums will first gravitate to looking for something with the Blizz stamp. This entire sub can pack up and move to this other forum, and it would not be as visible to any new players. And incidentally, it would eventually die. I’ve seen this happen with other forums.
---
As for stability, official company forums will always, always be viewers as more stable than someone s private setup. Whether it is a matter of money, or of impartial moderation, people will generally trust a company more.
---
I’m not knocking this individual. I don’t know a thing about them. But people will want official Blizz forums.
---
Welcome to an RPG game. Bye!
---
I played UD female and remember a patch when it changed from smooth to extremely twitchy.  I think that's when I moved over to a blood elf.  It was definitely smooth in vanilla.
---
The only issues are out levelling the mobs that drop the cloth you need and then you're stuck having to use the AH. And also you can kiss first aid goodbye
---
If you boil it down to simple statements, that’s pretty much any MMO ever’s experience.
---
youre sad enough to like mop unironically so that's already something to be afraid of bud
---
btw saying "no content" is exaggerated bullshit and you know it. tannan jungle and ashran were the best things blizzard could ever come up with
---
I’ve never played World of Warcraft before. Heck, I’ve never played any MMORPG before. When I heard Classic was going to be a thing I figured this was probably *the* best time to get into the hobby. I’ve been lurking on the subreddit for around a week now. No clue what anything means but I’m happy to be here.
---
4 fireballs is not oom at level 1 what is this noob talking about
---
Quests and dungeons offer better gear than crafting, it's a gold sink.  I have tailoring on my mage and the flying carpet is neat, but that's not in classic.  Never worn the gear I've made to level it.
---
Yeah Honestly i dont give a fuck if u run dungs with 5x yourself, even if that is kinda unfair aswell for gearing up easy and by yourself in a social MMORPG game. But in pvp? No fucking way.
---
actual clueless argument "oh it's easy so we shouldn't worry about playing the game right"
---
I'll let you get back to eating crayons...  something you're actually successful at.
---
I think it's cool, is there a difference between this one and the one with a night elf on it? Is it just a horde alliance thing or was there different stuff in it...or do you not know lol just curious
---
daily retailbadgivemeupvote post.. great sub
---
It's almost like a level 1 mage implies you're not incredibly powerful
---
Well I guess thats true, but How Big is that problem in classic? 
---
That might be a problem Too if i play on a pvp server lol
---
You know how we do, for the alliance+
---
We asked for the game as it was then and that's what we are getting (or as close as practicable).
---
Just because some neet poopsockers will clear mc in week 2 or aq within hours of the gong doesnt mean anything needs to change.
---
Those guilds doing that on private servers have been playing the same game for 6+ years and grind r14 on every fresh for a pve advantage. Johnny Casual and his 39 friends arent rolling through shit on day 1.
---
I cant now (it happened last week and havent been home)
---
https://youtu.be/TR7FC-h0Fb8
---
At the very least, it needs to cover the cost of the reagent, the person will set the remaining balance on how valuable there “time” is. It all depends on your level and there’s too. If you are level 60 and geared, 1 gold is pretty standard. If you are level 30 and relatively fresh and no main then I’d say 20 silver about. Just my opinion.
---
This is actually what my buddy and I are doing, we both decided on rogue and when messing around on the beta noticed how fast it was to mow through mobs and how little damage we were taking. We were able to pull 4-5 mobs at a time with evasion and backstabbing whatever mobs were hitting the other person.
---
We already came to the conclusion that there will be x-realms so it doesn't matter. Blizz will pair horde heavy servers with alliance heavy servers so it will be 50/50
---
Hahahaha that’s what I was thinking
---
You don’t have to worry about that anymore, your main will be in a different layer!
---
You can go ahead and go look at retail wow stealth animation at max level and compare it to this.
---
Not really sure why there are o many memes about wives not liking that their s/o plays wow.
---
Hell, me and my S/O Is going to play it together.
---
People play retail as well - there are some people that enjoy retail - I disagree with you that this isn’t about preserving a Classic game, that’s why Blizzard from the very beginning said 1) that they promise to keep Classic around as long as WoW is around and 2) that they do not want to run and maintain 2 MMO’s side by side. Whether or not their mind will change, the point is that that’s a clear indication that this started out as a preservation project
---
I don't see why a multiboxer is less fair than you a 4 friends ganking someone mining in Winterspring. If he makes the effort to set it all up and control it all then why not. you can do it yourself also. And be real, how often do you really see a big time multiboxer, the one we had on our server in Vanilla up to Wrath wasn't someone you would see constantly unless you went out of you to go and find him to derail his business :D
---
You have to cover the cost of the rune. Most will ask more, but some give a sliding scale for lowbies.
---
It was around 2.x when they fucked it up
---
I knew something felt off. I guess I'll be rolling Orc Rogue unless they fix this.
---
how is that mediocre? they used all of their mana. Vanilla requires at least a little strategy. Shoot 2 fireballs whack that mfer with a stick shoot a fireball. Another one. until you hit 60. I can't wait to go oom or be rage starved. At least then everything won't be handed to me. Ill have to put in my time and the more time i put in the more it pays off. That is was vanilla was about. August can't get here fast enough
---
I’ve been thinking about this for a while. It may take a while because there will be a massive rush of people coming in day 1 and there’s no mob sharing. So that in itself will take a while
---
I can definitely appreciate that!
---
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW, I played the Esfand clip at the top right next to me flying in game and its just ugly.
---
Well are all your opinions based on retail or classic? Because i thought levelling it as u Go would give u a few usefull pieces
---
Lmao okay Hamp 😂😂😂
---
Or maybe I have a different opinion/experience than you? I was a Disc Priest Naxx raider, so I literally have firsthand experience talking about the gear acquisition dynamic of clothie to non-clothie healers in Vanilla. Sometimes our Druids and Shamans took cloth if the Priests were already mostly geared up. Usually they went for their tier gear instead.
---
Whatever they feel like giving. I don’t set a price. More often than not you would get more than 5s. It’s mine retail where you have 3 hearthstones, 3 cloaks and whatever else to just jump around. Portals in vanilla saved you a shit ton of time.
---
Wait, portals cost money in vanilla? o.O
---
I figured I was just gonna charge for the service..
---
You’re assuming layering affects BGs at all. I don’t think they’ll need to.
---
Can you expect to clear a raid if 20 out of 40 people in classic are incompetent?
---
bUt pEopLe HavE sUmMEr pLAns dUuuH
---
go look at max level ud rogue at retail and compare it to this video, hello?
---
Pretty sure I died loads just getting into burning steppes through redridge
---
uhh, I don't think you read the post. It's about the griffin's animations, nothing to do with the path itself.
---
Sounds like the never ending downfall of retail.
---
Introduce a QoL feature that makes something easier -&gt; realize later it could have some negative effect down the line -&gt; cant take it back because people are used to it.
---
Could you link when it happened in the streams? 
---
ive searched through both asmongolds and sodapoppins clips and not a single one mentions phasing or layering from the WSG. Seems odd that no one clipped that if it was obvious phasing.
---
now youre an idiot for thinking that mage is more "engaging, challenging and faster-paced" than warlock. and how is that suddenly a "different perspective" if you didn't even say any subjective words such as "imo", "I think", "my point of view" etc. nice backpedaling there btw
---
in the short run, mage is a noob-friendly class with lower skill floor and has tons of CC. his skill cap may be decent, but it's lower than the warlock. warlock is also harder to pick up. if you're noob then a melee will shred you, unlike mage who has blink, frost nova, and other stuff. spamming rank 1 frostbolt oh so challenging ok buddy
---
How is it cheating? Where in the rules does it say so? Afaik the exact opposite is true with multiple people not being allowed on a single account. He paid for it, his right
---
In MC? Easily.
---
LUL “notoriously famous.”
---
Would love to hear about these thousands of examples you have.
---
Private server operators are missing the boat, when they are not releasing vanilla servers that would mirror classic beta progress and limitations for people who wont get beta access
---
Yep, the most fun part of vanilla WoW was the journey. Ironically despite the fact that we won't have the dozen extra continents retail WoW now has, the world itself is going to feel so much bigger and more dangerous. Even getting your first mount was a huge milestone because up until level 40 you just had to walk/run everywhere (unless you were a Shaman and got Ghost Wolf at level 20, which made you a little faster). I'm excited to see it all again and rediscover how the game was back then since after 13 years or so I've kinda forgotten, haha. No idea if I'll even reach level 60 but if I do, I'll just see what happens. It took me around 3 months to get to level 60 the first time around but I might've been especially slow, who knows!
---
Plus you really had to commit to any dungeons you agreed to run. Sometimes you'd be there for hours and you had to manually form your group by asking around or /whoing a certain class and whispering the level-appropriate ones to see if they were interested in coming, etc. But it also allowed you to form bonds with other players and at least if you liked playing with them, you could catch them again later on.
---
I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who never got to play it the first time around.
---
The teleport spell just costs mana but the portal requires a reagent.
---
Depends if you want changes or not. Personally I don't want them to massively change things. You increase HP, you increase fight times, you completely change the meta and strength of classes. Longer fights means more execute time and more of a gap between warriors and every other class. Less means things like Spriest/oomkin might actually be taken to raids. It also means mana becomes an issue for every other caster/healer. 
---
Unless you increase hp by like 5x it won't really make a difference for seeing mechanics. It'll just mean it's a ball ache to start out and an annoyance when on farm.
---
Show up and don’t stand in the goddamn fire.
---
Do you remember catching missingo on Pokemon red/blue/yellow making it so you can't load a save on that cartridge anymore? Or how in skyward sword you can break your save by talking to a certain NPC more than once at a certain point in the game?
---
Just because you personally can't remember game breaking bugs doesn't mean they didn't exist. Even popular games had their fair share of them
---
Glad I graduated already...now I can come home from work and ignore everything else when classic comes out
---
I had originally started in TBC with my brother. Our first characters were a BE and Tauren. As a new player I didn't know about the teleport orb between Silvermoon and Undercity, so I made the trek through Ghostlands, EPL and WPL at like, level 10. I died a lot.
---
It's harder for the players, sure. But not for the guilds.
---
In classic you need to farm 4 hours a day or get carried by your guild when in AQ40/naxx.
---
In retail you can log on twice a week to raid and get enough gold from BoE drops to fund your flasks and repairs.
---
Hijacking top comment:  
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I recall that each flight path was genuinly made. I.e. that even if you had to pass place B in order to get to C, you would't pass the flightmaster? So if your route was passing Thunderbluff HQ, you didn't have to fly into a totem pole, you would just pass it outside?
---
I started playing EverQuest on my one and only landline at the age of 11. People couldn’t call my house while I played.
---
In EverQuest you simply killed things all day every day to level. Sometimes there was a quest but it was few and far between.
---
When WoW released I had already played beta quite a bit and had some experience. I remember thinking that WoW was some cake walk joke of a leveling experience where you could just quest and have your hand held the entire time, which it was.
---
Compared to today’s iteration of WoW, yes its harder and slower (that’s what she said).
---
Maybe this is just me but when i started playing in 2006 I called it Tristfal until I realized a couple years later it’s Tirisfal.
---
Game.release(name="World of Warcraft: Classic", date=sys.currentTimeAndDate())
---
Yeah comparing server launch in Joanas speedruns and the stress test there are were so many more characters in the stress test. Obviously this isn't a 1:1 comparison since a new server isn't the same as the only server. 
---
It will definitely be hard and I imagine people ditching the starting zones in groups of 3-4 and killing all 5 mobs until they're level 5 and start questing in the second hub.
---
isn't this just a cheap knockoff of that paladin one?
---
you slide across the floor according to OP
---
I’m planning on waiting an hour to hopefully get past the first wave. We’ll see how well that works lol
---
Nah
---
True yet sad.
---
Good catch OP, it does add to the immersion for sure, hope this get's fixed!
---
I mean, you say this isn't vanilla-like, but this kind of theorycrafting and min/maxing feels totally vanilla-like. :)
---
Throughout the entirety of both BoD and Uldir races as well as during BFA launch.
---
He got the little ban ofc
---
I resubbed foe the classic beta hype and I'm currently leveling my main from 110-120. Everytime I turn in a quest, ding, complete a dungeon or a bg, I tab out and check the beta client lol
---
Not true. Ilevel does not matter that much, itemization and the amount of your main stat matters way more.
---
A Rune of Portals costs 20 silver.
---
I'd say the minimum wage for a level 60 is 25g/hour but a mage adept at AoE farming can make upwards of 50-100g/hour, but let's use the minimum wage.
---
The cast time is 10 seconds, so that's another ~7 silver.
---
Once a mage whispers you back accepting your deal for a portal, you're on his clock.
---
If it takes you a minute to find him, that's 42 silver.
---
If it takes you 5 minutes to find him, that's 2 gold.
---
So at minimum, we're talking 27 silver but more likely 1g.
---
I plan on never taking flight unless necessary.
---
There's not much on a fresh server really. The biggest things would be summons and ports to cut down on travelling time and gold to make sure you get riding/bags/skills asap.  
---
There's not much danger of any of the big streamers getting first 60 at all, that will go to people that have spent months and months practicing routes and staying up for 3 days straight.
---
You can play prot up to 60, you can do ret too.
---
You are more efficient as holy at 60.
---
Doesn't mean you have to play it, that's up to you.
---
Thats’s why i said it’s just a meme. Don’t take it so seriously
---
I guess I'm the only one who saw a butthole, implying that BFA is ass
---
I leveled it as I played, don't remember having any real issues. Selling off bags and the occasional decent BOE item definitely MORE than paid for it. (Robes of Arcana!!!) And if you're not getting any good gear for whatever reason (bad luck, nobody to run a dungeon with, etc.), then at the very least, you'll have better gear than you did before.
---
But that was on an established server. I can't speak for it on a brand new server. If nothing else, you'll have bags.
---
I'm so happy that you have grown up to live a grotesque and twisted life where you don't have fun and put everyone before yourself. GG :D Maybe you should delete your char and reroll.
---
It will the felcloth gear is noice
---
its just really boring, thats all.
---
Personally I think the best solution to this is somewhere down the line, open up new servers that tweak mobs to be harder. That way we keep our pristine #nochanges servers, and we have an interesting challenge server to play at some point.
---
There are official Blizz forums already.
---
haha, I've never seen that before. It's great!
---
Vanilla. You ideally want uncommon green quest gear or blue rare gear from dungeons. The crafting options are pretty bleak.
---
naw. it wasn't hard to do or anything.
---
Yeah i heard, isnt it BIS preraid?
---
I wish I’d never bought a house, I can’t pay the mortgage if I go part time at work
---
In instanced pve, yeah it’s more powerful than any other point in wow. In pvp there is no deminishing returns on pvp so it only takes a couple of people with sappers to wipe a mass multiboxer
---
Oh shit you're right. 
---
Well, they got up to 150,000 in a few months with 0 advertisement, 0 help from a corporation. Blizzard shut it down for a reason.
---
That’s fair
---
Same. I missed the stress test so I didn't even get that. I checked yesterday figuring if I was going to get in it would probably be a weekend thing. Nope it was on a Wednesday. That'll teach me to assume things.
---
Something about the witch hunts in the subreddit rules, I think.
---
Alliance is over populated because people would rather pick the "pretty characters". Dumb reason but that's Alliance players for you.
---
I had a similar experience, but I played a warlock. I ran out of mana then realized mana exists for the first time in 4 expansions. This made me smile because I realized that I'd actually have to worry about something other than dps instead of my resource just being completely full all the time.
---
better read the post, catch you later
---
WoW was influenced HEAVILY by EQ, but it wasn't a 1-for-1 clone.  I think the semi-casual nature of WoW actually made it more accessible than EQ, which lead to its popularity.
---
You saw dozens of MMOs pop up in the years after WoW released, and they were all hailed as the "WoW Killer" but none of them ever delivered.  Some had great ideas, and did things better than WoW, but in the end, they tried too hard to copy WoW.
---
We've had 15 years of WoW clones.  The only ones that ever came close to the success of WoW was Final Fantasy.  And that's because they decided to go in a different direction.  It's that willingness to take risks and try something new that's going to overthrow WoW as the king of MMOs, not trying to do what WoW does, but better.
---
I guess you could take half the time of the boat taking one full turn (back and forth)  since everyone are shipped at exactly one time during each full turn.
---
I looked up the dungeon guide on amazon. A new one goes for about 100-155 now. 40 for a used one.
---
I mean yeah if you don't think streamers will be 60 before most people you're crazy, they'll have epic mounts within a week or 2 while it will take the rest of us plebs a couple months.
---
As far as quickest leveling there will be someone 60 within 4 days of launch.
---
Most streamers who push hard to level will probably be done inside of 7 / 8 days and anyone after the 10 day mark will take 2-4 weeks.
---
Robe of the void and yes it is
---
That's true, in endgame there is nothing to do as casual. Collecting your prebis and farming mats, gold, professions only makes sense if you're gonna raid. And you cannot raid as casual, it needs several hours of commitment at a time on a schedule.
---
Looks like he failed the stress test.
---
And in about a week after that, it dropped to 1/5 of Dota's viewership.
---
&gt; Do you remember catching missingo on Pokemon red/blue/yellow making it so you can't load a save on that cartridge anymore?
---
Oh man, you mean that **obscure** bug nobody knew about unless they looked it up and did the elaborate setup of talking to some guy in one place before flying to another place, etc? Yeah, Pokemon red/blue was totally unplayable.
---
And no, I haven't played any modern Zelda games, so you might have me there. I'm pretty sure Skyward Sword was firmly in the age of new dev trends, though.
---
You can play whatever spce you want. Go wild! But if you're serious about raiding you will want to go holy. Ret and prot is really sub-par in a raiding enviroment.
---
That said, prot and ret is viable as leveling and dungeon specs at 60. That, and Blessing of sacrifice is a valid reason to bring a (one) prot pally to raids.
---
True, i can just farm/ buy cloth When cheap for bags. Its like a backup plan to make a few pieces of gear as u say
---
The beauty of classic wow is that the private servers will be able to use this opportunity to calibrate to become even more classic. On one hand, we can get true classic from Blizzard, and on the other hand, private servers have more data to become better. Either way, it's a win in my book.
---
Ill have to research the recipe, thx
---
I will 100% be multiboxing Classic.
---
That's good to know.
---
Imagine them complaining on a part (level 1-4) that is over in 30 minutes. That's what they complain about.
---
This reminds me of the poison animation. Can someone confirm its presence in the classic beta?
---
I suggest you give it a try. Since it shares a subscription with retail and retail has a free trial, I'm pretty sure classic will as well. 
---
I think it's a great game to play even if you don't have a lot of time because everything you do in the game feels challenging and immersive. If you want things handed to you, however, classic isn't for you. It's pretty beginner-friendly IMO and there will probably be plenty of new players so you'll be in good company.
---
They did.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=550t8jeYRgg
---
Yesss I really hope they fix this.
---
3 days might get you to 45.
---
I see, but as mentioned u could always make bags and just collext some Nice recipes
---
Well it needs to be at least 20s or you're losing money on every portal.
---
I bet they split them before the next Mythic race, it makes sense cos then both sections will be near the top, as opposed to at this moment in time Classic has 130k(2nd) concurrent viewers and BFA has 3k viwers (around 55th) which makes the current game look really bad and does more harm than good for Blizzard especially when I imagine a lot of these streamers who are playing classic right now will play retail for the new patch.
---
Were you a Druid/Wizard in a past EQ life?
---
You can pretty much count on healing and buffing in raids as a paladin unless you are playing in a casual guild.
---
Prot paladins are very good for tanking dungeons because of their AoE threat but don't count on tanking in raids.
---
Ret paladin is a joke in pve
---
If on a 10k pop server only 3 had it, then it fully deserved the gold fee.
---
No. Progress through expansions like seasons over and over and over until the end of time.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14514#comments
---
They are only doing layering for the first few weeks as they have said
---
4 days seems insanely high if you consider the insane theorycrafting power levellers are thinking of. I literally saw someone chart the starting levels in so many ways it's crazy. I imagine it will become more insane the closer we get to launch.
---
If anything the late August release is better as we get that next Monday off for Labor Day
---
This man played vanilla :)
---
No way it will be 5s, I see 1g minimum especially after the first couple of weeks when people are tired of running / flight paths.
---
Making the effort to set up multiboxing is not a valid reason at all. Is it also valid for a software Engineering to make the effort to create a software to see throu walls in csgo? After all he spend time and effort creating the software, you could just do the same? And beside, how often do you really see someone using wallhack? 
---
And come on Dude, if you cant see the difference in 4 people doing effort in a game that 1 person can counter with some money and software, Im just not gonna continue arguing with you.
---
Assholes are in every game, I highly doubt there were none in vanilla and Classic won't be immune either.
---
&gt; I think playing retail will provide more insight versus not playing at all
---
They're totally different games by now. You don't need to play retail to learn the basics, whatever MMO OP played before is fine for that since the basic concepts are the same everywhere.
---
Whatever experience you have it will make you learn a new MMO really fast.
---
&gt;It’s all the things outside of raiding that take up a lot of time.
---
I don't want changes. I want to see the mechanics of bosses lol
---
This isn’t vanilla, it’s WoW Classic Beta.
---
Aha I found it! Endurance training from the old resto tree. Thanks for aiming me in the right direction!
---
O your referring to Method live streaming their Race to World First's. I guess that counts.
---
Oh please.
---
Nothing of [his initial statement](https://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/feature/8075/Mark-Kern-My-Own-Kobayashi-Maru.html) alludes to any of that for Firefall. The only way to assume that is his rant where he [begs players to stop playing it](http://archive.is/Emuuo) so he can buy it back for nothing. I implore you to read some replies to him and his sad rebuttals. I particularly like the [top reply](https://np.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/4l1agq/what_buying_back_the_firefall_ip_really_means_by/d3jipve/), so give it a look see. Someone who worked under him left a [lengthy](https://www.removeddit.com/r/Games/comments/1tuf3c/this_is_why_mark_kern_was_removed_as_ceo_by_red_5/) post stating why he was removed from Red 5. There's a nice [summary](https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story) titled the "Rise and Fall of Mark Kern" that mentions a bit of this.
---
Hope you enjoy your reading!
---
There’s not that many tailoring ones that are compelling. In classic you’ll be able to make 18 slot mooncloth bags. Versus 16 slot traveler’s backpacks for a dozen gold off the auction house.
---
Salty?
---
It’s the same thing, already happened.
---
&gt; That's okay :)
---
&gt; If you didn't do bg's in vanilla you wouldn't know.
---
* PVP'd when you had to maintain rank to wear your gear
---
* Leveled up a toon with pure AB/WG after they added XP to pvp
---
* Exalted with Defilers
---
You still have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Then kill it slower, it's a strange concept to ask for changes that affect everyone when you will only care about those mechanics the first few kills.
---
I did. Tried all variations.  
---
BFA is the most popular one in the end (for retail) if we exclude warcraft and if we dont include world of warcraft game search.
---
Insanely high as in you think it will be done sooner? Just curious because the first pack of 60s will 100% have multiple people playing the account / character so they'll have 100% uptime.
---
Even with 100% uptime on a PvE server I don't know if we'll see anything under 3 days 16 hrs ish.
---
You can better wait a few days/ 1 week for the first wave.
---
Fantastic, thanks!
---
Farming it isn't terrible. I never out leveled an area keeping up with my tailoring. Even farming for this one recipe, I remember I gained a level and a half. That was the single most experience I ever "accidentally" got, and it wasn't exactly game breaking.
---
And I seem to recall some Warlock quests that benefited from tailoring. I used to sell robes required for one on the AH for something like 25 gold apiece - made a bunch of gold that way. But again, that wasn't on a brand new server.
---
True. I get enjoyment out of them trying to find me when I’m 60 yds in the other direction. As far as they know im waiting till they aggro something.
---
I can't seem to find that info. Has it really been confirmed? I'm googling because that would be a big deal.
---
Oh yeah, there's no way Blizzard will get rid of LFG/LFR at this point. I was thinking of other MMOs. If other games are going to compete with WoW, they need to understand what it did right in the first place, just like WoW did with EverQuest.
---
At least that's my take on it. Who knows? Maybe we'll see the genre go in a different direction.
---
With an army of people helping you you could have people killing the mobs you tag all the way to 60. You could have some people boosting other people with mob tags elsewhere so that once you get too high level for the people killing mobs for you to do anything the higher level people can step in. You could basically have a pyramid of people mob tagging with the sole purpose of having people high enough level to help one person get world first or w/e. 
---
You could have warlocks stationed in every major quest hub/location for to summon everyone.
---
Also you could have an army of people farming mats for speed pots/crafted gear for everyone
---
With this setup, your guy can use the mob tagging technique. My bet is 50h of /played
---
Oh, so is it not even profitable, if You have any knowledge of the prices and crafting costs?
---
It’s hardly a generational thing. It’s just developers creating dopamine drips. The more frequent the reward the more time spent playing. I remember CoD4 being significant with that because you were constantly being rewarded and that felt different at the time. Now it’s standard and has only gotten worse. Its one of the worst things psychologically for kids next to loot boxes (I.E. gambling).
---
Yes, it has been confrimed.
---
That means we are grown ups now and able to prioritize our time. Theoretically
---
It doesn't need to be in the offhand, but there isn't that much value in having a fast offhand all the time anyway, and a 1.4 vs 1.7 offhand dagger will make almost no difference while leveling.  
---
You could even conceivably just never train dual wield and swap a dagger for a sword/mace after the ambush, then have a macro that swaps back to your dagger when you stealth.
---
Okay...well you’re entitled to your opinion. 
---
I believe playing retail isn’t going to hurt a thing and at the very least will familiarize the OP to the setting an concept. 
---
Unless someone wants to go into things blind, who cares?
---
Coincidentally, my gf and I were stoked for Cata. I started playing in 2005 and got her into it while we were in college in 2010. I never did much BC content and we'd horded over 12000 gold selling savory deviate delights so we were pumped to get flying mounts...then some asshole in china (at least it was a chinese IP) hacked my gmail and stole my wow account. Blizzards customer service was so incompetent, asking me to send them a copy of my driver's license to confirm my identity. They rejected my copies three times saying they were too blurry which was bullshit. I got so frustrated about it + it seemed like everyone hated cata and my gf was graduating and we wouldn't be living 2 hours away from eachother any more so WoW went to the wayside. 
---
We're married now and tried to get back into WoW in 2017 but spent the whole day just ridiculing how hard retails just wanks you off constantly with no challenge...then Classic was announced. Literally counting the days and praying that it launches reasonably smoothly.
---
We’ll have to see... no matter how close Blizzard gets it to 2005, the economy will inevitably be different - tons more player knowledge of what’s valuable, all the loopholes/niches known, etc.
---
One thing that’s certain is that in vanilla/classic World of Warcraft, gathering professions earn money, and crafting ones burn it.  I am Alchemy/Herbalism on my rogue, in classic and BC I made 3x as much selling the raw herbs than the pots, with the exception of flasks.
---
Some classes are woefully underdeveloped and balance is seriously questionable at 1.12.
---
If the game is going to continue in the long term, changes will inevitably be made.
---
That was What i thought aswell, and if i have a level of mob grinding anyway i Can target humanoids
---
Wow thats Pretty good money, but yeah it’ll take me a while to level so Maybe the server Will adjust prices as ppl level
---
a week maybe?
---
If you want to be after the curve I'd suggest not starting until at least 2 weeks after release, and that will only work if you play casually so you never catch up with the bulk of players
---
That's alot sooner then I would have thought...cool man
---
At 40 if you want a change of pace, go 26 into prot (Sanct/Reckoning), then continue up Holy tree. You can tank instances if needed. But also have a slow 2 hander for questing. You can't /sit proc Reckoning, but you'll be surprised how much you naturally get crit from mobs.
---
Also, find a good porn website.
---
Maybe a day or two, there still be a lot of people but the masses that play the first day will be progressing at a neck break pace so you should be fine.
---
Yes I completely agree, maybe the smartest choice is just 2x gathering
---
The only people concerned with the release would be children and students. Working adults don’t give a fuck because we always work year round.
---
Are you a teacher?
---
Exact same thing for me... just started school again after military service. One hell of a way to start a semester...
---
Where can I find your pro guide!?! Looks sick!😂
---
The fastest guys will ding 60 days in under 4 days. I'd imagine they'll only sleep once in that time - probably at around 3 days (lvl 52 or so).
---
He’s a teacher.
---
rank 1 sprint and rank 1 stealth vs max ranks thats why, not bugged
---
I only care about people that pvp in skill based pvp games, sorry.
---
Someone actually did the math that you can increase the experience gained by mobs, by grouping with a bunch of level 1's, because in a group of +3, the total experience gained is higher than if solo, and high levels get most of the experience from kills, which means at I think around 40+, being grouped with a couple of lvl 1's, will actually increase your exp gain from mobs.
---
Teachers
---
The smartest choice is what you enjoy, but to fund future toons, yes, you’ll want a gold cushion. Gold is VERY hard to come by in vanilla and double-gathering is how you can buy your 1000 gold epic mount sooner.
---
Robe of the archmage is pretty much used until Naxxramas depending on what setbonusses you have but as a standalone robe it's one of the best in the game. 
---
Once you have crafted it you can drop tailoring but it's definitely worth getting
---
Horde is over populated because people want to play the spooky characters. Makes them feel more grown up. Skulls are tough
---
I thought that was a 10 min CD?
---
Drop out of trade school.
---
They've said in one of the Q&amp;As from beta announcement event that the reports will not be handled by AutoMod and there will be no instant bans for mass reports for things other than cheats detected by the system(speed hacking, flying, etc)
---
you can use a bunch of people in a BG to report someone and they will get automatically booted in retail. There is no human check, it just goes by number of reports and autoboots you
---
Blizzard: Fun detected.. fun must be deleted
---
Was about to comment asking how much these go for ... admittedly not as much as I thought they’d be.
---
Im glad we wont be playing on the same server. Only an American trump supporter would go post something like this. Go jerk off to yourself.
---
Mage is best because with blink/nova/arcane explosion they can not only tag mobs but have a bit of control too
---
In theory paladins, priests and warlocks can spam aoe too and tag everything
---
Some of the 50 would bring mobs to you to tag, others would kill them after you tagged. EZ PZ with 50 lol
---
Iowa State represent
---
Damn son!
---
Blizzard says that their will be a human element to the report function; someone is going to be determining whether it's just a spam report or if its legit.
---
I think I'm gonna have to play casual with her, probably have to have 2 characters right off the jump though no way in hell shes gonna wanna play as much as I do, thanks for the response
---
You don’t know half of it. If you think a tagwar is a nightmare wait until you see what happens when the ranking system is out but bgs aren’t. Anyone worth honor to level 60 players will be farmed and that is from level 48 and upwards. So if you wait too long because you think the leveling zones are too populated you might as well just wait till bgs are out.
---
He was being sarcastic...
---
Intimidating shout is a 3min CD but that's irrelevant. What matters here is he pops Intimidating shout at the same time MC hits him. Theoretically the intimidating shout shoulve feared all of them around him but he was registered as a friendly target at that point because of the MC, therefore intimidating shout did nothing.
---
Guys i had the true beta look at me
---
If you are playing casually with you gf a week at maximum, cause most people with be way out of the starting zones. But tbh what do i know. I guess it depends on how many people know about classic at launch and how many will join afterwards. There might be a stream of players coming into the game over the first few months cause of streamers. So its actually a pretty hard question you are asking
---
I just feel like everyone is going to jump in and start power leveling immediately. I imagine starting zones will cool down after a week but, who knows. I could be completely wrong.
---

I see what you mean. I just doubt that we are going to see something entirely unlike WoW, rather something philosophically similar to WoW with enough differences to offer a new-ish experience. It would be awesome, though, to see a completely new MMO style become popular.
---
It's anyone's guess, at this point.
---
Nothing wrong in disagreeing :)
---
No, you’re not.
---
Free advertisement. That's why.
---
Hell yeah hope that makes it to classic , afk money would be dope lol, as long as it's alot less gold/hr than actively playing ofc
---
Your a nobody as far as advertising to the masses goes, what did you expect lol.
---
Yeah...i dont get it. It looks Fucking AWFUL in the first clip. Its like hes walking on a conveyer belt in an airport lmao.
---
Grow up.
---
Quality meme. Sadly don't think too many have watched that movie and will get it.
---
Oh yeah, if you're not a power leveler, then you'll probably benefit even more from the economy. People are right in that dungeons can give better rewards, but if you do a lot of soloing and only do dungeons OCCASIONALLY, then I can't recommend it enough.
---
And the bags are great for alts or friends.
---
&gt; Where can I find your pro guide!?! Looks sick!😂
---
You can start [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vVip37hSWo)
---
Oh damn didn't even think about pvp, might have to roll PvE server with her and pvp on an alt
---
No, you are not getting below 4 days. The only sub 4 day clears have been on non fresh private servers with broken quest xp values. Don't regurgitate the myth
---
I did!
---
Also thanks for doing all the research I was too lazy to do myself, because I really don't care about anything he did outside of WoW.
---
Hope you learned something.
---
I said notoriously **In**famous. Not notoriously famous
---
If you have a good duo, and skip the first few quests and grind higher level mobs and get out in front of most people, it won't ever be a nightmare.
---
WoW vanilla was a lot easier compared to its competition at the time. WoW removed negative progression and grinding by using quest hubs and actual quest with quest markers. in other MMO's of the time. It was possible to lose experience, levels, gear, and your actual character to server rot. WoW's target demographic...was the casual player that didn't want to spend $15 a month in 2004 to the chance to lose your entire character. Or the lose the level you gained after grinding for 8 hours because some monk trained the entire zone to the zone in area where you logged in.
---
I wish I was you. I still remember clearly the screenshots of an orc shaman friend of mine coming across his first rock elemental on his quest to get his first totem..
---
I was against WoW at that time, as it pulled the competitive community of Battle for Middle-Earth apart and many a friend was lost to it... 
---
But then those screenshots got sent to me by my mate..
---
It was like turning on a switch. Something I'll probably never experience in my life again. Something ignited in me and I needed to know more. I needed to explore and experience the world with my own eyes! And what a world it was! 
---
For months I ran around without having a clue what I was doing. The first toon being a nelf priest - melee priest. Saved all my gold for that juicy beastslayer enchant, known then as "red glow". I sucked a lot. I realised I should probably play warrior since I tried to melee my way through Deadmines, not really grasping that agi and strength on priest probably isn't the best, and it's not a class you melee to 60. 
---
The friends I made.. the learning and exploring..
---
The only thing I'll find sad for you, is the community knows how things work in details now and what's coming down the line.. but you'll still get to learn it first hand :) 
---
Everyone deserves the feeling of that switch being turned on, regardless of what causes it..
---
Way too soon. I'd say like 4 weeks. 
---
Until the hardcore players have 2 lvl 60 chars, the normal player 1 lvl 60 and the casuals 1 lvl 30 leveling will be like in week 1.
---
You surely arent the only one but you have to realize its a business thing, not a personal thing. Letting the streamers in gets them a ton of free advertising. Oh well
---
That’s not untrue, but it’s a small fortune to get there.
---
I know that's just my personal deficiency because it would just bug the hell out of me, I could easily set the 24" 1080p I have sitting in the corner of my room up next to it.
---
Cool thanks what's your favorite streamer so I can join that server too! I want you to teach me 😍
---
agreed, it seems to be an unpopular opinion somewhat to think that there are NO good changes. having improved graphics is as far as i want them to go.
---
I thought the same. but i was worried about letting 1 month of a new ffxiv espac. If they realese like they did with ESO would be very efective. ffxiv will be the n.1 sub mmo for june.
---
This isn't satire though?
---
I'm looking but not seeing it.
---
No because dispells completely nullifies your class.
---
Priests are better as healers. Shadowpriest don't bring enough to replace lock or mage as ranged dps/control.
---
Oof that sucks. I was lucky to get the shoulders early on. At least you’ll have a chance soon!
---
The amount of money you'll lose out on by not going with 2 gathering professions will be enough to level Tailoring all the way to 300 by itself. The gear won't be such an improvement to have a major effect on your leveling speed.
---
Keep all your cloth save for what you need to level First Aid.
---
Ding 60.
---
Sell all your shit. 
---
Get to 300 tailoring in an hour.
---
I don't have much Classic SPriest knowledge (literally none) but just wanted to give you a heads up that BG's won't be available upon initial Classic release.
---
You can even see the giant holes from the poles that were shoved up their asses.
---
Dude not gonna lie, BfA is so bad it cured by WoW addiction.
---
Only for Classic to restore it back.
---
John Wick already got me with that trick. Devil begone!!!
---
If I were in your position I wouldnt watch streams, research on the game or anything like that. Just drop in, get confused, find something useless to do, accidentally sell your gear away, etcetc.
---
The sense of wonder is the thing I miss the most, and I know I’ll never to get to feel it again.
---
Good to know. I’m glad I kept mine.
---
Sorry for the late response, glad you liked it!
---
I get wanting a lot of stuff to remain unchanged, but there’s some things like animations that are fine to be changed.
---
Yeah and as a warlock i Can spend that extra gold on gear and things i need!
---
Tyvm, appreciate it.
---
I learned you can't reason with stupid. Thanks!
---
Anyone with a character of high enough level on a 1.12.1 based private server could test this. Taxi nodes are client side. So, no reason it shouldn't be exact playing there.
---
Then you could make a side by side video.
---
good luck saying relax to anything related to classic, these people are literally crack heads without crack right now
---
Who are you? Exactly, completely irrelevant nobody.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I see the business side of it completely. Just open up another 2-4 servers and open the gates.
---
Well WoW has dominated the market for so long, it's hard not to draw comparisons.
---
Hi, /u/Kallrathas
---
\*cough\* [https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=281](https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=281)
---
Literally the problem with pvp this expansion, and not just with rogues.
---
There is no "level 70 protect." Protect is a role action that all healers get, it has one rank, and it's a flat percent increase to physical and magical defense at all levels. The level of the healer that casts it on you mean nothing.
---
Shadow priest is a 1v1 class, if plan on doing any kind of group pvp dont play it.
---
I can't remember if they confirmed this on blizzcon or in later interviews but I'm 100% sure that this has been confirmed. I'll link you the source if i can find it.
---
I would say im between medium and power leveller, so yes itll Fit me good. Thx for the tips
---
Very true
---
Screenshotted, thanks for the tips!
---
their*
---
Unreal that people downvoted you, this sub is full of complainers and hypersensitive reeee kids.
---
I know I am naive but I think there has gotta be some form of open thing. Maybe it will be the final stress test, maybe it will be just after that for a week. I still believe
---
Hi, /u/cR_42
---
Those where the days, twitch chat aint got shit on this stuff.
---
I love professions in Ultima Online. They set a very high standard that MMOs since have had difficulty replicating.
---
and then maybe they could charge a 10k gold fee to give us dungeon finder!
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Race](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Race)
---
Lmao the fact that people have downvoted you so much is hilarious, I hate the people in this sub
---
I agree with you that they probably just wanted to make the game better, at first. But at some point I am pretty sure that the game was designed less with the intend to make it better, but to retain existing and gain new players.
---
And from what other game should they have learned? WoW was the first MMORPG that got this kind of fame and success. Were there any games before, where they could have seen the long term impact of flying mounts, dungeon finders, etc.? I doubt it. At first those features were welcomed by players because they didn't know either. How could they have known?
---
And the problem with features like that: it is very difficult (if not even nonviable) to go back. All we can do is hope that they have learned now and steer classic+ (if that will be a thing) into the right direction and not make the same mistakes again.
---
I'd appreciate it. I'm still looking, this would be a pretty big deal.
---
&gt;six
---
I'm taking at least 10 when it releases.
---
A new cool thing to complain about. So hip.
---
What happens if there are a lot of "completely irrelevant nobodies" who band together?
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Base_attributes
---
Just admit it; you aren't here because you want to argue with me, or prove me wrong.  We've formed a connection, you and I.  Something that can't be broken by mortal means.
---
Well, i don't really give any importance to what today's Blizzard says. They say what is the best business decision, not what's really going on. Saying it's a preserving project is a safe move to protect retail.
---
How do you know?
---
What if my staff is bent but burns as if it has a fire enchantment every time i pee?
---
While the yaw is indeed locked to zero, I think it is the less noticeable bug and not what everyone is talking about primarily. The more significant issue is the locked in roll ("swinging side to side") which in vanilla videos can be seen going as far as 45 degrees.
---
To make sure we're talking about the same thing, here's [a picture of the pricipal axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes) for reference.
---
The mob respawning bug that causes everything to respawn same time need fixed before launch for sure. I’ve dozens of bug reports in and we haven’t even tested that last 30 levels of the game.
---
Hahaha it’s almost like you made this thread so you could throw insults at multiboxers
---
All these answers here are bulls\*\*\* in my opinion.
---
Of course Shadow Priest is great in group PVP. Checkout Kala at Twitch and his Youtube Videos.
---
It all depends on your skill level.. and yes you can also heal with a shadow spec.
---
Just play whatever you like and become good in it.
---
Was watching a classis beta stream and this guy was referring to retail players as retail retards. It definately goes both ways.
---
Reelevant clip from Monkeynews talking to Payo https://clips.twitch.tv/PreciousCoweringJellyfishKAPOW
---
Can you buy these in a digital form somewhere?
---
Different strokes for different folks. Its not for everyone and thats okay.
---
*cough cough* her opinion sucks *cough*
---
Bis for tanks, too.  Solid threat hat.
---
right on the nail
---
I agree with this Hands down. Mage is definitely the best PvP class all around. A good mage can beat legitimately every class
---
Yes!!!
---
As someone who played Everquest I still find it mildly amusing to see so many people talk about vanilla wow like it was some kind of hardcore rpg. 
---
I love WoW and agree that it revolutionized the genre but it also ended the days of hardcore mmorpgs. I never could have guessed at how casual and simplistic retail would become, so ironically I'm now counting the days to get a decent challenge out of the very mmo that I once considered so easy.
---
I never played EQ.. I'm a "wrath baby" lmao
---
Game developers' vital task is to protect players from themselves. Players will abuse every loophole in a game that makes things easier. Just like you stated in your post regarding 5-man dungeons. This links to the fact that players will keep asking for QoL changes and other additions, that might seem really cool first (eg. flying) but fundamentally change the way the game is played.
---
I only care about things that matter.
---
Expectations were low
---
I played a Holy Paladin almost exclusively from launch till BC. If you want to do endgame raiding you are going to be a healbot. If your guild has endgame on farm status, then you can start experimenting as the raid doesn’t have to be min-maxed stat wise. Healing is a ton of fun, but if you do any damage it will be seal of wisdom auto attack to regain some slight mana. It’s been a while since I played WoW so someone chime in if I missed something major.
---
Such a dick move, when ganking or any wpvp I will engage combat on sight, if I kill I stick around and if they rude emote or re-engage wpvp I will also reciprocate but if they're trying to evade or ignore me I'll just /goodbye them. Fuck camping out low levels.
---
Wow, yeah. That pretty much hits the nail on the head. That's a really interesting phenomenon
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an0kEqsnW3U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an0kEqsnW3U)
---
I did BFA. Tagged as many mobs as possible. When they all died I was topped off already.
---
Do you happen to have a time stamp for that? I'm on mobile and don't want to watch the whole thing
---
It's not, and people should stop pretending like classic is harder or more complex than retail, or pretty much any expansion in WoW.
---
Classic isn't fun because of it's complex mechanics or quick, reactive gameplay. Retail clearly has more complex and challenging raid/dungeon mechanics(for the most part). And it's fine to admit that.
---
What retail doesn't have is that true RPG feel of Classic. Things being slower paced and requiring more time and patience is what makes it rewarding when you reach goals or milestones, something severely lacking in retail. There is no sense of adventure on retail, and the game has a metric based design system that incentivizes daily log ons and currency/slot-machine grinding instead of specific, targeted goals which you reach at your own pace.
---
And those are the things the classic community should be pointing to when explaining why they love classic. When Classic people talk about retail being easy and the players being bad, it just looks silly, because anyone who has played both would know that high-end competitive PvE content is significantly more challenging and well designed on retail.
---
Unfortunately no, I've been trying to get Esfand, or really anyone, to help nail down the timing. Afaik, no one has extensively researched this so I made this to help with that.
---
Because we lost a game to the people that made it into its current mess. They are not losing anything. They're getting an additional free option they don't like.
---
Aren't undead locks the better choice though?
---
It's funny how these people always feel the need to post about that stuff publicly. "Retail isn't bad guys. R-right? Please agree with me!"
---
Yeah, obviously you didn’t play rogue in vanilla. The sliding looks awesome.
---
When Classic was first announced I went there and ordered brand new Guide, Bestiary, Dungeon Companion, Atlas. They were between $15-20.
---
How many of us are going to take the first day off just to try to get access to heavily overloaded servers?
---
Queue squad
---
They’re supposed to be finding bugs. It’s not early access. It’s playtesting.
---
No it’s not.
---
I've been in the same guild since wotlk launch, and a lot of the people in the guild I played with since vanilla, we just had to reform into a new guild due to people in the old guild leadership quitting and leaving us without control.  Almost all of our new players over the years have come from puggin through LFG, which didn't kill the community aspect, it just funnels it into a whole bunch of tiny splinters making the game extremely difficult to find friends for new players.
---
Shes never played WoW or any computer game for that matter more like Nintendo shit lol I have faith in her but honestly do t think well be a good duo together ahead till she gets the controls down lol
---
I'll be very surprised if they do.  Vanilla was never hard.  It was just more time. 
---
That being said MC as of 1.12 will be a fraction of what it was in 1.1.  Way different experience.  One taking hours and hours and hours.  The other will be done in like 30 minutes -especially if private servers are actually over tuned.
---
The authentic **overall** experience would be nice, but we're not getting it in Classic.
---
Hi, /u/Furymn
---
You have a monitor but not a keyboard at work?
---
tbh, by day two or so, if layering works out the way it should.
---
Can you show me instances of this happening on streams?
---
Yeah I think it will be under 4 days, but I feel like private server misinformation is the basis of my opinion so it isn't completely fair since all streamers have said it takes longer to level on beta and if they feel like its significantly slower in the first 30 levels then it might be around 4 days.
---
Even considering that surely it has to take less than 4 days if you dont have any travel time due to being summoned to places. Again this is purely hypothetical so you can make up anything that is "theoretically possible"
---
Kargoz also theorized that an ambush spec might be really good with a druid leveling partner. Starting level 10, you can have the druid hold aggro while the rogue does crazy damage. Plus, you have heals and roots etc.
---
Seems pretty fun
---
Just press once?
---
what the fuck?! they removed first aid!?!?
---
I think its a case of both, the model coasts here and there in vanilla—in these beta videos I don’t see any coasting, just a static wingflap animation.
---
cant take the shit back, it's all over UC
---
The only potential positive aspect was the building of world pvp merely because the flightmaster was dead and you were stranded unless you wanted to run because the next chain in the link wasn't available.
---
Pfft, try living in an area where it peaks at 110 F for 2-3 months, and where winter isn't really a thing.   
---
The heat monitors give off is no joke.
---
I agree that the old one looks better.
---
Striving for a perfect classic will always pull out differing opinions on what should be what.
---
Yup, and no problem. I hope I saved you a lot of time and frustration.
---
No that is the definition google just didn't include it in lmao
---
If a sub 3 day run is completed this sub will lose its shit.
---
PvP trinket/ skull / WotF say hi! Seduce is not a great answer to rogues to be honest. There are very few other than being tanky enough for them to not kill you and that is pretty hard but doable with VW.
---
Same.  Quit after the nerf patch in Cata then tried again in MoP.   Was even more facerolly. Haven’t been back since.
---
I actually made the thread, because i wanted to know the answer to the exact question i was asking in the thread. Still dont have a clear answer. Wont hold me back from trashtalking all the lowlife multiboxers that this thread generated thou :)
---
This was my hope as well. Unlike the OP I think TBC was the best iteration of WoW as it took the pillars of classic and built upon them. Yeah it made many zones in Vailla obsolete but that's the same argument of Duskwood making Westfall obsolete... sometimes you just progress beyond an area. The level experience of Vanilla was still so important in TBC. Wrath was when they really started to introduce some of the changes that changed the game and put it on the path to where we are now.
---
Still Vanilla is very important. I would be thrilled if they added content or made a BC server that existed in parallel beside the classic one.
---
Rofl. Imagine being this [salty](https://i.imgur.com/IJGahcw_d.jpg)
---
What's your guess on first rag clear? I say day 23 but feel it's probably going to be sooner
---
Well, there are different kinds of people. And I am pretty sure that the majority of possible customers do not enjoy frustrating games. Because the majority of people who play games are very casual. Just look at the gaming market, mobile games make up the biggest portion of the market! So it is pretty safe to assume that you have a possibly bigger audience if you make your game more accessible to those kinds of gamers. It's very simple really, just look at what the majority of AAA games is like nowadays: live services, predatory micro transaction schemes and copying whatever game is very popular right now.
---
So it's not that they do not understand, but that the majority of the decision makers do not care. They want to make money (which is fine imo). The problem is that all of it is extremely short lived and in the end fucks everyone.
---
We don't know how end game content will be played, but if the low level dungeons are any indication, its ironic that  how I've been saying pservers are inaccurate is true, but that they were overtuned and not undertuned.   lol.
---
I did that when I played on my first Nelf rogue back in the day...going to do it again this time. In my head it's the only proper way. Teldrasill then get my ass to westfall-&gt;duskwood-&gt;stv
---
I've had most fun that way even though I had little to no idea what I was doing, but westfall had deadmines, duskwood had those mysterious dark woods with Stitches and lanterns...and no need to mention STVietnam...Kalimdor for low level alliance is boring, imo. Can't wait to go back home argh...August, hurry up!
---
Eh, it is fine.  
---
They like what they like and dislike the slower pace.  Keep in mind that vanilla/TBC/wrath players were the ones who ushered in and demanded mechanics like dual spec (or something similar), LFG tools, and increased leveling speeds.
---
He’s funny
---
Standard price for ports is 1g my mang
---
Well now I would like to buy it
---
Imagine being this entitled lmao.
---
&gt; Streamer named Savix got banned because the RBG team he beat reported him.
---
**Stop spreading lies and misinformation.**
---
The only automated penalty is a squelch, and it gets removed as soon as a GM reviews the information (if it indeed was a false report.) If you're guilty as charged, you will be silenced or suspended depending on the severity of your actions. If you're not guilty, then the squelch is lifted and you will be free to play as normal with no lasting penalties. 
---
#You cannot be suspended through an automated process. 
---
So Savix was banned by a GM, not because the enemy team mass reported him as he claimed.
---
Ikr. It's basically the asmongold sub. I can't stand the twitch crowd
---
I've heard SPriest/Lock is a gnarly 2v2 pairing, I think they were speaking on wPvP for context.
---
You dont have to imagine :)
---
If you want to keep up with dedicated friends, then it isn't casual.  They might be raiding by the time you finally hit 60 and start grinding dungeons. 
---
If keeping up isn't an issue, then you will be fine.  Just expect a 3~ month leveling process.
---
I'm voting this up. It's a great question. THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION.
---
I'd say you roll for your main spec in dungeons. If someone is healing because there's a shortage of healers they shouldn't be punished for it.
---
I far prefer Tirisfal for leveling
---
Do u guys get paid for this? Or do you truly enjoy free advertising for these streamers?
---
Hi, /u/NowhereMan87
---
Sure, same with character models too while we're at it..
---
Oh, and X Y and Z ..
---
Hey Robbaz! Didn't know you played WoW :D
---
I do not first hit anything that has a gray level. Unless they attack.
---
Damn that was good , I feel the lyrics in my soul
---
Looks like he already made his decision
---
Be glad you are still taking classes and not tied to a full time job yet.  Not only will you have less time with most jobs, but you are likely going to be fatigued.  
---
One of the harshest lessons for me growing up has been that reality.
---
You don’t have to run much, zeppelin takes you there and after that it’s a short run after that. Even elwynn =&gt; dun morogh would take longer and would be more dangerous than that.
---
Thats a sexy site, thanks
---
Ok I'm actually retarded the video i linked was from before this was confirmed.
---
Watch this video instead at 6:36 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNDRddh_p9o
---
Here's an interview with the devs.
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo
---
He said it would be in phase 3. So it will be in eventually. Are there even going to be bgs before then though? I'm not up to date on what all the phases contain.
---
As someone who wants to play a Druid this go around (was a rogue and eventually a priest in Vanilla) I’ll be making the run right there beside ya.  Already did it on the beta, with deaths to those accursed alligators, it takes about 40 minutes to Dun Morough and then you can add a bit for the Deep Run Tram.
---
or maybe you know, they saw alliance shamans and horde paladins running around, and in general just hated the expansion and went on to private vanilla servers?
---
And what will everyone do once they band together?  Not play retail?  Lmao.
---
Sorry man not tryna be a dick.  I know your frustration I’ve played since release (though quit after Wrath or Cata) and have had a running sub for years just because I still do log on occasionally.  It sucks not getting in but it is what it is.  Classic is getting so much fucking hype from these streamers so their decision to be so selective is obviously paying off.
---
Damn. Your first sentence is so true. Played since vanilla and this is the first expansion that I haven't reached max level. Quit second week of BFA.
---
I personally wouldnt spend 80on all
---
You are hitting the nail on its head!
---
In legion they really should have just changed the color/name of that armor class, they used legendary because it was already there with the highest ilvl budget to account for procs on top of stats, but they could have just used the old retired red color for that or something.
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
They said sharding would be.  They reworded their statement when layering was announced.
---
They said layering will be used as long as 'needed', but isn't expected to go past a few weeks.  So if the game remains extremely popular and is growing for half a year, then we will have layering for half a year.
---
I might blow your mind too..
---
i added up to 30 people in Bnet in just a week, with pure mythic+ grinding.
---
Some people say, they weren't able to make friends in the last 2 years really, and i'm just asking myself how unsocial someone has to be if he isn't able to make friends?
---
Retail is still a shitshow though imo. and LFG/LFR have nothing to do with a social game.
---
It's not about numbers in vanilla. It's not about charts and who does 2% more dmg. Vanilla wasn't fair, each class is different. Choose one according to preferred playstyle, not according to how much dmg it does or how strong it is.
---
You make some good points, and I'm exactly like you. Used to play Classic 10 hours a day as a kid, now wife and 2 kids. I've come to the conclusion I'm just going to PvP. Whatever they do, as long as it's nothing like retail, I will enjoy somehow.
---
&gt; Cool thanks what's your favorite streamer so I can join that server too! I want you to teach me 😍
---
I'm not convinced you're teachable.
---
"was that it just me?" yeah you're literally the only person in WoW to dress up bank alts
---
Yupp same. Did my rogue to 99% into r12, guarding the wsg flag all day. So boring and it made me quit until TBC. Also why I'm not rolling rogue again, it's tempting to top the dps meters but rogues are so boring in group pvp and 5 man's. Going mage in classic.
---
Hopefully they will merge servers once the F R E S H hype has gone.
---
well if you find elite dragon now at that level you cant kill because of scaling and the buff mobs got
---
I don't think Blizzard cares enough to do that. Why bother making new content when you can just release old expansions once people get bored of classic, at a fraction of cost and end up being praised and showered with money
---
Or he did and still think the sliding looks bad.
---
Basically just show up and follow instructions.
---
No one is perfect and never has been.  Even in hardcore guilds, people make mistakes all the time.
---
Remember when you got your first grey shoulders? That was epic.
---
sadly u can have, what back in the days was considered awesome looking shoulders, shoulders as a level 1
---
Yes, they will. They have already said they will and if there are queues then so be it. They will likely give people the option to transfer off to lower pop servers if it bothers them and let the players make that choice
---
Sounds like a pretty austere life. More power to you, oh wait you're posting on the classic wow forums lol
---
Yup. Huge risk
---
Ok, that said phase 3 as well, which matches the other vid I linked. Your link also said bgs would not be in before then, which answered my other question.
---
Lol saying they definitely won't get below 4 days is just as much a myth as saying they will. No one has speed ran a proper vanilla server in 12 years so yeah it's hard to say exactly. What we do know is 4 days 20 hours will be a very slow time in 2019.
---
It's also in their best interest to limit supply, it's better for advertising. Its shitty, but it's better promotion. Personally I feel every single account created during vanilla should have gotten an invite. Someone on this sub said they managed to get an invite on a fresh account with 3 days subscription provided by a GM to "test the game"
---
Aww shucks maybe I can just follow you around and by osmosis get some brain juice.
---
I didn’t mind whacking things with my staff at all. People who say it ruins class fantasy are full of it, I’d say it’s fine, supports the fantasy even. Plus it did serious damage in early levels
---
I think your later point would eventually happen. Blizzard would just increase queue times by allowing less players. Long queue times would definitely spread out the population to the less populated realms.
---
That guy is a moron don't mind him.  
---
I appreciate the answer you gave us.
---
Possibly, but if it becomes a server issue i don’t think anyone would mind them adding larger servers to deal with the amount of players. I think the layering is strictly because they know at launch there are going to be a ridiculous number of people logging in at the exact same time. That likely won’t be the case later on as even with a large player base people will be logging on at various times due to work, school, you name it.
---
&gt;Classic has an advantage over retail version. It has the capacity to release updates and patches that the retail version was criticized in the past for not doing.
---
The average playerbase are not game designers and judging by some of the terrible ideas I've seen get popular on r/wow and r/classicwow, I shudder at the thought of letting the community start voting on what changes to make. Remember how people wanted all specs to be viable? That idea alone is responsible for so many things people hate about retail. 
---
Remember how players asked for Flying mounts for ages? Try being the lone person pointing out that this might be a terrible update.
---
Players also begged for LFD to mitigate the fact that making dungeon groups manually was impossible when leveling through content from an irrelevant expansion at its original pace.
---
The MMO/expansion paradigm is flawed to begin with. How do you add vertical progression to a game that wasn't designed from the ground up with that content in mind?
---
&gt; just correcting retail based on community voting (kind of like OSRS)
---
The OSRS voting system is a total meme. Anyone who plays OSRS knows it's become a formula for casuals to ruin the game while serious players nit-pick every decision and **Jagex ends up forcing updates anyways.**
---
Just ask any OSRS player about PvMers voting NO to PvP updates and vice-versa, pretty much out of spite because both groups have a visceral *hate* for each other.
---
You will pull aggro everytime your backstab crits then not be able to do anything because the mob is facing you. The warrior can use mocking blow(I forget the CD in vanilla so it might not be viable to do everytime you pull aggro) or stance dance to taunt. Either way you are making the warrior work harder than necessary. Also you will have more downtime do to the warrior taking 100% of the punishment and need to eat while you sit there at full health where a sword rogue  can help divvy up the incoming damage more.
---
I'm iffy on that source because it includes DKs and levels beyond 60. Also, I've got a screenshot of a 60 undead rogue with 33 int, and that should be way too low according to those tables.
---
yeah the whole skybox etc are very wrong
---
No there will not be any BG's before that phase kinda like it was in retail vanilla, the BG's got added later in the game and not from launch. This info is legit.
---
Problem is the game outside of the raid. When I was coming how from work it felt like I had to go working again bc of all the systems you had to play to not fall behind.
---
Thats why I am so excited for vanilla. Playing the game at my own pace.
---
Can you do that?
---
Make the right choice.
---
EU or NA server?
---
Exactly. 
---
In reality none of these other replies have any idea. Most are based on pserver experience which is a completely different population level to classic. Any comments from those (few) playing in the first week of vanilla are based on completely different technical setup from classic.
---
I doubt it.
---
They're manually selecting who they want to take into the beta, if one of your accounts doesn't meet the criteria, the others probably don't either.
---
Damn, this makes me remember Timeless Isle in MoP, where you could literally run around with Burst of Speed in stealth all day and chase players who are mounted up. It was fun as fuck, but not gonna lie, also broken as hell.
---
Yeah! Should I be a mage and teleport everywhere? Or a warlock and have all these awesome class quests? Maybe a rogue to be a pvp annoyance and to pickpocket everything? Duh! And then there are professions, the only one  I don’t really find appealing is leatherworking, I think it’s almost more demanding than engi in vanilla.
---
Should have had atiesh as the staff
---
So nothing except for something. That something right there is reason enough to not release it yet.
---
I cant decide whats worse  
---
having two thirds of specs be absolute dogshit or everything being good but slightly having fewer unique tools.
---
Uptime and CD timing make a huge difference! I remember playing my alt mage with shitty blue gear trying my heart out and doing better than the well geared mages because they didn’t feel they needed to try as hard.
---
That and play the boss mechanics: fire bad, walk out of the group when you are the bomb etc
---
If Joana himself says he's sure he can get his record down to 4 days played time (from 4 days and 20 hours back in the day) then I imagine organised groups who have refined their routes a lot more over the last few years can get under 4 days played.
---
Definitely sooner, streamers can organise the best 40 players on the entire server, buy every single useful piece of gear and spread it to guildies and immediately clear rag. I think 18-20 days is possible.
---
Ayy same boat with me and a bunch of friends. Quit during MoP, we all started in TBC super excited for vanilla.
---
Oh nice. Thanks for the link
---
Undead Shadowpriests were godlike back in vanilla.
---
Why’s that? Many things have meaning to me including this game. What doesn’t appeal or matter is watching some coiffured guy play a video game. More power to you if that yanks your chain though man. Different strokes for different folks 👌
---
I dont know about the design being superior tho. Sure the raids are more challenging. But it rather fells like I am playing dance dance revolution than an rpg.
---
You do have a point :/ cash grab.....
---
It's funny you say that. I and many people in my old guild started searching for greener pastures then due to ToC
---
All that grind will be deleted anyway. We will all play classic soon enough. But i get it.
---
I saw this thread. Didn’t even bother to leave the starting area.
---
Not Nostalrius, it was near 50/50. Definitely less than 10% apart from each other all throughout the server's history.
---
This sucks dick.
---
if anything hopefully this proves people will play another game. hopefully the endgoal is a remade Vanilla like 10x bigger scale.
---
I want realm forums back so badly.
---
ohh look another layering thread where the OP doesn't even have the facts about the system, fuck me.
---
Classic and retail share the same subscription so if anything they’re gonna make more money
---
How is it not satire
---
Since you have to be subbed to play Classic, I don’t think they would care. All they would care about is those sweet $$$ rolling in, regardless of what version of the game people were playing.
---
let's just pray that retail players are overwhelmed by the grind of vanilla and decide to stay put
---
Bag space is part of design. They asked Kevin Jordan about it on the countdown to classic podcast on warlocks
---
This build would work for pvp? Or its potatos? Is there any Master Demonologist that works (for pve or pvp) or DS is too superior?
---
i don’t understand what they did to talent trees. i logged into my lvl 70 main from TBC and the talent system looks like dogshit
---
I have a The Burning Crusade account active and a 2006 July Vanilla account. The Burning Crusade account is EU and has been active ever since. The Vanilla account was inactive but activated it last week hoping to get beta. The Vanilla account is NA and has both the Vanilla and TBC Collector's Edition. No beta so far. So I don't think activating more accounts really helps.
---
Doesn’t matter, one was in the original game and one wasn’t, so if Blizzard really wants to recreate an authentic experience they’ll fix this.
---
You're just getting the true Vanilla experience. I don't envy you, lol.
---
Had to farm Azshir the Sleepless the rare spawn in sm gy for the best in slot neck piece. I put a lot of work into this video. I hope you all enjoy it and I hope blizzard starts inviting more people to the beta.
---
No it was already a small chance you would even get in and now that they've said they've pretty much met their beta invite requirements (in terms of pop) it's even less likely.
---
Retail has a ton of microtransactions, many of which aren't very micro. If all the Retail players started playing Classic, Blizzard would lose money.
---
People have not changed, the environment did. Gaming and its market wasn't as refined as it is now. Gaming now actually is a really big industry. Back during vanilla it was still somewhat niche, although rapidly growing.
---
Humans are inherently lazy, we will always look for shortcuts and for optimization to get to a set goal as efficiently as possible. Always. Our brains even go into auto pilot for everyday tasks.
---
Game developers should take that into account when making games. And I am pretty sure that they already do, on both sides. The ones driven by big corporations like EA use the fact in predatory ways and companies that care about the gaming experience will make sure that we do not fall into that trap.
---
I always kept in mind, if it's red it's dead but don't camp them because in a time like this you want players to stick around for the long run. Camping them may easily push them to other things and they may not have a chance to git gud in wow, but then again that's just my outlook.
---
It would be fun to roll with a guild like that. Know of any that'll be active?
---
I like it because by the time I’m raiding it will be cold and I can stay indoors all day long!
---
The issue isn’t Blizzard then, it’s the people? So it comes down to what voice do they listen to? The memelords or the accounting section of Blizzard Entertainment. If Blizzard can’t sort through troll opinions or troll posts, then we have multiple issues here. 
---
TLDR I think you have no faith in the community and Blizzard.
---
Well you're right about me being opinionated. It's my opinion that modern MMOs are bad, though there's more nuance behind that statement than I can fit into a TL;DR. But it's not immature to hold that opinion.
---
It's not wrong of you to like modern MMOs, but you act like it's a personal failing of mine that I don't like them too. My point is simply that a lot of good ideas in the genre have been abandoned without good reason, and the new ideas that took their place just don't accomplish the same thing.
---
I don't remember the patch level, but you are correct in that they removed the ability for the death ray to crit.  It still can hit pretty hard though.
---
You're forgetting that Retail has a ton of microtransactions, many of which aren't very micro.
---
Meaning and mattering are way different. Also you seem to think I care about streamers and you're dead wrong. They could all drop dead and the gaming scene would be better for it.
---
Look your arguments are solid but I would still love to play BC again, on an isolated server that stays BC forever.
---
Love me some esfand but this is pretty Standard 10 times a bg play
---
Unless I'm missing something, those aren't the correct values. They list no growth at all for a lot of classes, and I know from old screenshots that my 60 human warrior had an unmodified (the number is white instead of green) 30 int.
---
No idea which one is the real way it's supposed to work but I hope for the health of the game it's that you're ported back to where you Q'd after every BG. Groups will gank on FPs 24/7 without moving and solo queuers will be stuck in cities during Qs without being able to play the game while waiting if queues are long.
---
&gt; everything being good but slightly having fewer unique tools
---
&gt; wait, I can.
---
That's a totally loaded way to look at it, come on my dude. I can phrase shit in my favor too:
---
I can't decide what's worse: Having classes with playstyles incredibly unique from each other and dipping a little into all three talent trees to perform as a *Class* and not a *Spec.*
---
Having all Specs completely separated from each other, effectively creating 36 separate Classes, but ironically having their uniqueness sucked from them to the point where all of them become Builders/Spenders.
---
People love this game and are willing to play a franchise that actually cares about content.
---
Happy to agree on that one.
---
They already have grass graphics in there as an option, why not updated spell animations and models.
---
i’d say there is 90% chance microtransactions come out before Burning Crusade
---
I would date to say that armorsmith May lead to more profit since the BS helm is perma BIS for dos, but honestly i don’t know
---
Real gamers subscribe to Peggle
---
&gt; Aww shucks maybe I can just follow you around and by osmosis get some brain juice.
---
Keep the dream alive.
---
"You think you do but you don't"
---
Armorsmith crafts the best Warrior helmet in the entire game for the entire game.
---
Weaponsmith (Axe) has Nightfall, which some guilds use but mostly Horde (because shaman can keep the proc up more often).
---
Everything else is meh.
---
No, I don’t watch twitch streams but it’s been a real issue on retail for years.
---
Indubibly.
---
This continues to excite me: as I was just tearing through mobs on my warlock in current wow.... 3-4 shotting everything and still always being at 100% health and mana.   Gets a little brain dead after 5 minutes...
---
I haven't been subbed to the game since Feb and I have a beta key.
---
Closest I see is barrens.chat, it's sooo pretty I'm sure they are adding individual realm forums, not sure how popular it will be.
---
Hell yeah! I love that there are more people who love that route! Now if only you're also on EU that would be amazing haha
---
Personally, Id go Weaponsmith because everybody goes with armorsmith. I went Weaponsmith (Swordsmithing) on a private server, loved it. Crafting  Blazing Rapier, Sageblade  and  Dark Iron Reaver.  Anyway, thats my personal choice. Enjoy!
---
Same here man! Luckily not too much happens week 1, but I have had classes that contradicted that rule.
---
Every time this is posted I comment that they're the same animation, just played back at different speeds. This time is no exception.
---
Also releases during Burning Man.
---
I took two weeks off for that 😃
---
Reality is manageable
---
Except if that hobby turns you into an out-of-shape useless sack of shit who refuses to enter the real world and take care of responsibilities.
---
In other words, like 99% of WoW players.
---
Considering a large majority of people that are going to play classic do not currently play retail, the sheer volume of new players paying $15/mo should out weigh it.
---
Man these classic wow threads are some of the most upturned nose, elitest bullshit ive seen in a while. Cant help but feel like some if not most of you guys didnt even play this game and now have some weird fake high ground. 
---
The top comment is the crown jewel example.
---
This makes such a huge difference. I would honestly play a different class if we're forced to look at the new Benny Hill animations instead of the badass vanilla ones.
---
You must not have many life responsibilities.
---
I dont recal SSs stacking in WotLK
---
Exactly! Like, you ARE the adventurer. Like 1-10 is the equivalent of like...e.g. 1-3. 
---
Like, for D&amp;D you just get your character archetype and your class feels like it's coming online (a battle master fighter or a evocation wizard). 
---
And similar for WoW, at 10 you get things like searing totem, hunter pet, priest racials or bear form, all which involve some lore and (some) lengthy quests.
---
They give more options and are overall more game changing than old stat sticks.  
---
Also able to change them on the fly to fit situation.  
---
I like it. I dont feel anything by putting 1 point into some shitty passive that does almost nothing.
---
Awesome video papa, see you on August 26/27
---
Blizzard doesn't want to replace one stream of revenue with another, they want both, that's how business works.
---
Yeah we don't know yet. I'm not saying blizzard should pre buff things definitely not.
---
Wrong side of the “pond” sadly but I’ll be with you in spirit.
---
Try to avoid streamer servers. Believe
---
That's so cool! I didn't know it was a thing in MtG either. Such a nice little word and now it's in two of your (possibly) favourite things!
---
please tell me its in the game, theres nothing sweeter than undead poison animation
---
Hydramist
---
I'm kinda with you man, BC was a masterpiece, but about mid-wotlk, things just got...sort of "un-wow" like. 
---
I enjoyed the scenery and story telling in MoP, but I never again had that sense of achievement after BC
---
I’m probably looking forward to profs more than anything actually!
---
Ehh Living in something that "isn't the real world" is still the real world, people can get obsessed with anything
---
NA
---
This is one of my favorite parts of Vanilla. Loved solo farming bosses on my mage/rogue for upgrades. Nice work on this.
---
Actually I agree. I dont think it effects BGs since we are getting cross realm BGs. But as I said above, it would effect PVP (world PVP specifically). Even if it only effects each server for a few months, it could be enough to push some people away from playing, or at the very least, create ghost town servers with lopsided faction populations
---
PvP, that is gonna be problem for casuals as we are as well, the best pvpers were using high end pve gear. I remember those wsg sessions when we met the hardcore pve guild on the server, rogues in t2 with aq40 shoulders and helmets etc. back then (it was Black Division on horde side, they had some worlds first/second kill or something i think too) and we just waited till they got their flags. Resilience and high quality gear that can be “easily” obtained via pvp came in tbc. It wasn’t really easy but getting rank 14 in vanilla so you can get yourself some nice grand marshal weapons was impossible on some servers. And those grand marshal weapons and gear was still little worse than gear that you can get in bwl or later in aq40
---
Video games are all about the epeen! Without it we wouldnt know who was the bestest!
---
You turn ugly as shit in bed?
---
A lot people miss that “Wild West” vibe, myself included. I think that’s what we’re seeing in this subreddit and (in my opinion) hopefully in classic.
---
That misleading photo makes them look like they’re the same height.
---
That's what I'm curious about. Once more people start getting to endgame that is when reality sets in. Particularly since we are not getting BG's until what, phase 3 which probably will release sometime in the early part of next year. Not every one likes rolling an alt. This is important because there isn't one spec that will rule them all so the spec that you want to play may suck donkey balls for the activity you want to play. Thus you either suck it up which the grand majority of people wont do and rightfully so since they are playing a game, you roll an alt or you find a new game. World PvP is great fun and will be the only source of honor till the roll out BG's thereby incentivizing more but will that be enough?
---
Classic WoW is a game that isnt designed for quick pick up and play sessions. Not even a little bit. While there's nothing wrong with that, per se, many people arent able to devote the amount of time that Classic demands. I'm really looking forward to living in Classic, as are many others on this sub and beyond, but lets not kid ourselves. Once the shiny wears off how many are going to stick around?
---
Exactly. Recruiting a gang of people that aren't generating any revenue by getting them to sub. 
---
Sure there will be people leaving retail to play classic, but the majority of classic players will be returning subscribers that quit awhile ago.
---
Good thing that my terms starts 21.9 hah
---
And how does that apply when Classic eventually brings in fresh subscribers?
---
Don't think /sit procs work for anything in classic
---
It's satirising how IRL problems take the backseat to WoW problems.
---
I genuinly hope i will see more ret paladins, balance druids and ele shamans. I want to see underdogs unite!
---
People get summer off. Here I am working all year and taking a week off for launch is my vacation.
---
Ya haha, I maybe should've said that it is indeed 5e. It is one action though, so only once per turn but it does get [more powerful](https://www.dnd-spells.com/spell/fire-bolt) the higher level you become, which is like WoW ranks.
---
We don't talk about 4e
---
they'll keep doing layers for as long as they need to.  not like people will care anymore by that point, they've been playing with layers for a few months anyway
---
Show us on the doll where BFA touched you? Damn bro.  
---
Classic will be a success but it is unlikely that it will end retail.
---
Them classic Warlords of Draenor servers!
---
SM Armory has been cleared, I dont think cath has been. The last boss would be the problem in cath.
---
Will be a few weeks - keep in mind Labor day is 1 week after launch so anyone that doesn't take off the first week will have a 3 day weekend to hop in as well. 
---
If you guys start on that Wednesday/Thursday you'll probably have a good time.
---
If you are after a lower population around the starting quests it will be a month.
---
Would be helpful if you showed map where you entered the mountains still not sure where this without following your path from the start
---
If you're still in classes, chances are wow classic wasn't really meant for you
---
Exactly! I was mucking about on a pserver today, practicing my 1-6 on my druid and it's a small thing but at level 1 and only having enough mana for ONE wrath and then at level 2, having enough mana for THREE wraths makes like...the biggest difference. 
---
It's so SO TINY but it matters.
---
Too much drama and sheet?
---
From what I've seen streamers can organize cool stuff. Not saying that they are NOT doing it for views but in the end it's more fun for everyone.
---
Good example was for example 4 Horsemen fight or the first boss in BWL. Everyone had his job and if you fuck up you'll make it harder for the rest or in the case of Naxx, die horribly. Tanks, kiting, AOE healing, tank healing, burst damage phases , void zones and all in one fight.
---
That's not going to happen. A lot of you overestimate the widespread appeal of Classic. It'll no doubt be successful and it's a great game, but it's not even close to being for everyone.
---
I mean, he’s providing examples and you’re kinda just going “ no, you’re wrong”
---
No offense, but why should we believe you if you aren’t providing any form of proof?
---
You'll find it harder to get spots in pre-mades because there are other classes/specs who will do everything better, but if you're good I'm sure there will be exceptions. A healer is always going to be more valuable to the group but do not mistake that as calling shadow priests bad. They're incredible if played properly and one of the most fun specs to PvP with, IMO. I always liked to bounce back and forth between healer and SP.
---
Who the hell plays human when dwarves exist?
---
I'm not sure what's the significance of microtransactions being in retail. Retail players will most likely still play retail alongside classic
---
I don’t care. Stop thinking beta is that important to be a part of that you whine about others who got in.
---
Well, the Vanilla developers knew that humans tend to follow the path of least resistance when they balanced dungeon loot. They didn't need to learn that lesson the hard way. Of course, it probably wasn't as clear back then, in the moment, especially with all of the tempting convenience that group finders offer. Hindsight is 20/20.  
---
And yeah, I'm not expecting Blizzard to remove this stuff from modern WoW, either. It would be really, really interesting to see them try... but yeah, probably not.
---
Yes, Shadow priests were known for melting faces for a reason.
---
Except it does  yeah you made friends doing M+ sure. And what does M+ and classic have in common? Exactly. Its not lfd. I dont think anyone will argue that you wont make friends doing M+ or ranked pvp, but before lfg you made those friends already while leveling and not when doing harder content. Not saying it is impossible to make friends otherwise, its just not common. And even if you do the chances of them being from your server isnt huge. And friends that arent in your realmpool are limited friends, you cant trade with them for instance.
---
For me August 26th is the last day of exam time so it's perfect 😊
---
Retail WoW is 100% speed though.
---
&gt;I dont feel anything by putting 1 point into some shitty passive that does almost nothing.
---
What, you don't feel the adrenaline rush when your frostbolt casts 0.1 second faster?!
---
Wouldn't understand being pissed over someone else getting something - 
---
Where it's upsetting for me is the fact that it's a classic wow beta...majority of people that will play on launch have already played vanilla so why not increase the beta to multiple servers and invite a bunch of people?
---
It's not like they bring the beta server down right now... so just open up a few more servers let more people join and only play those servers while we wait for 3 months. 
---
That's the part that's irritating - trying to keep the beta exclusive for "specific testing" - if that was the case it wouldn't just be 100% uptime.
---
I will be a Druid but god I hate horde characters
---
&gt;The philosophy was based on mistrust not the slippery slope fallacy 
---
I would say it's about 50/50, I have dozens of replies from people when I have suggested any sort of change, outright saying that would lead to LFR etc.
---
We would need some actual data of Wow's micro transaction sales to have anything to base opinions or arguments on. 
---
If we assume that Wow generates a big part of its revenue through micro transactions, and that Classic draws a majority of retail players away from retail, then sure it could bear problems. But they are two pretty big and shaky assumptions.
---
They can ! Absolutly ! But they also attract the worst people 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Are they dumb? Who in the hell would to that to an already good animation?
---
So long as we get some proper Barrens chat and whatever nonsense people spew out on twitch chat doesn't invade it.
---
Twitch chat is just complete gibberish I swear.
---
The sharding in the starting zones is a way bigger issue than this imo and yet I see a lot of people supporting the sharding.
---
&gt;TLDR I think you have no faith in the community and Blizzard.
---
Okay, let me phrase this differently. 
---
Game design is hard enough, but MMO design is the hardest because eventually you have to do the impossible: Add expansion content that feels relevant, yet at the same time doesn't render the previous world completely irrelevant. No MMO (other than certain perma-death MMO-types) has figured out how to do this.
---
What's the problem? Any added content will negatively impact the original game because **the original game was not balanced nor designed with additional content in mind.** You would need to completely redesign 1-60 in order to keep Classic from turning into Retail all over again. How would it turn into Retail?
---
Try manually finding a dungeon group for Grim Batol during Warlords of Draenor without LFG. There simply aren't enough people online in your realm, at your exact level range, in the same zone, needing to do that particular dungeon on their journey through 60 levels of irrelevant expansion content.
---
Without LFG, there would be *zero* group experiences while leveling, for most players. People bemoan the loss of socializing, but imagine being forced to stand around Shattarath trying to get a group together for Sethekk Halls during the Mists of Pandaria expansion. Forget about it.
---
The fundamental flaw with Retail is that they kept piling on expansions, one on top of the other, increasing level caps, adding extra zones (accidentally diluting the population) and power creep. This is something that everyone, the community **and** the accounting section is going to ask for.
---
There's an alternative, but that's another topic entirely.
---
Casual but still not as casual as retail WoW.
---
But in comparison though, D&amp;D 5e is more *accessible* for new players but still retains a challenge curve based on many factors including a) player experience and b) a DM (dungeon masters) desire for hard encounters and interesting encounters.
---
Retail WoW currently is just rush through a dead world with little to no interaction with the community where you are greeted with a soul-less endgame. Sure, the raids/mythics/technical stuff of it has vastly improved but it's lost something in the process.
---
The significance is that your average Retail player is more valuable to Blizzard than any Classic player. Blizzard will be incentivized to either increase the value of a Classic player (by introducing other streams of revenue) or incentivized to convert Classic players over to Retail.
---
If the game does hold its sub numbers for that long, do you think they should open fresh servers and offer guild transfers and such?
---
Sure you can do that, but you failed. Since what you said isn't true at all.  
---
Also, I listed negatives for both classic and retail.  
---
You listed positive of classic while showing negative of retail (on top of it not being true).  
---
Not the same at all and completely disingenuous.  
---
Classes still have unique tools, its just that now some specs have it as well.
---
shatter to me doesn't necessarily mean mage. 
---
An ele can shatter with lightningbolt instant chainlightning +shock etc. To me it's more a phrase of timed burst that hits hard and needs some preperation.
---
SL/SL does matter because the dmg you will get is lowered due to resilience and then further lowered due to Sl/SL. Making it way worse than just SL/SL on its own.
---
The reason why SL/SL isnt the most popular choice is because they're one: really boring to play and second because 1 and 2 are conveniently the classes and their specific specs that are good against lock. Thats no coincidence. Anything else and any other spec is kinda useless besides maybe 3s but mostly 5s.
---
I mean look at the playable combo, specc and class distribution in BC in the top 50 teams in 2s. 
---
And dont forget the manaburn,drain, vipernsting fun. 
---
It's actually sad.
---
Yup, the unfortunate truth. The thing is, on a day where Im stuck working 12 hours, I might be able to hop on for an hour. In pve I really can't do anything. PvP I can at least play a little bit.
---
It used to be the end of the journey, but these days the endgame is supposed to be the beginning of the game? That isnt exclusive to wow either. You see talk about endgame this and endgame that in nearly every PvE game that comes out these days.
---
Can you provide *any* evidence? Because OP provided some only to get completely blown the fuck out of the water because it was proven false.
---
PvE server.
---
Dunno. Might be misleading for someone who doesn´t know the guy.
---
The notion that you have to put in x hours for everything isn´t completely true.
---
Given, finding dungeon groups and completing any dungeons with less than one hour of spare time is most likely not going to work out if you try to go for random groups. Neither are you fully efficient when your leveling sessions get interrupted suddenly and you either don´t use hs so you can continue right away vs using hs for sweet rested boni.
---
But the comitment itself is driven by the player, because the goals are set implicit. Since there is no big red arrow pointing your way, there are several ways to improve your efficiency, by getting better gear, improving your skill or more efficient socialising.
---
BFA is like a dead pixel on a 8k monitor.
---
And this is why we'll have addons.
---
Holy cow that might be the single best title on an article I've ever read, incredible that it actually happened
---
People are okay with this garbage but are #nochanges over some rogue stealth animation crap.
---
Is for beta cucks.
---
Man most of the toxic people in this sub are from vanilla wow. I was in high school when it released and now I'm 29. Youngsters have nothing to do with it. One guy is even bitching about millenials here lol. People just need to stop being so entitled and acting like classic is owed to them and that they own it.
---
I think it is a simple solution. Cap the amount of layers on every server. If each server is capped at say, 3 layers, then even if 100% of the population sticks around, they can remove layering and have servers with a population similar to private servers. This will also help spread people out at the beginning so even the smaller servers can get 1 layer and a few carryovers from a small layer 2 when layering is removed.
---
I have played TBC and Vanilla multiple times, and I truly find TBC much more grindy than vanilla. If you were fine with TBC grind, vanilla wont hurt you.
---
Ah, you see by the 3rd wolf if you've planned your magic mastery (aka regen) out perfectly, you'll have enough mana for maybe 2 fireballs but a lot of staff hits.
---
Then you'll be your own judge as to whether or not you going for the 4th wolf with 1 fireball cast and many, many staff hits until you can regen enough for another fireball to speed up the process OR sit and have a tasty mana snack and then go back to blastin'.
---
I didn't realize until this comment chain.
---
Watch a lot of porn while leveling
---
&gt;I was referring to new content after Naxx made with the vanilla design philosophy
---
So TBC.
---
I don't get the idea of post naxx content, there is virtually no vertical progression left available after Naxx, you are either hitting or close to hitting stat caps.  The gear reset in TBC wasn't done just for fun, it was necessary.  Any post naxx content would have to be some kind of horizontal progression, which may not be popular, and is definitely not in the spirit of vanilla.
---
\#DarnassusMasterRaceCapital
---
Get it while it's not yet hot!
---
wow crazy how you have all these solutions and every professional MMORPG developer is an idiot.
---
This will surely bring out the lowest common denominator of this sub.
---
No I feel my adrenaline rush when I level up my frostbolt and it becomes slower to cast, because I want to punch a wall.  
---
Funny that people shit on BFA for making you weaker when you level up (reducing secondary stats) when Vanilla did the same, and for some classes it was much worse.
---
Thanks for the downvote you dense idiot but no one here is comparing anything to retail. He is comparing 1.12 private server max level improved stealth spec to low level rank 1 stealth on beta. R/wow is over there.
---
I found this pretty cool! 
---
If one can add wishes, I would really like teleportation mechanics added with i.e. a click box (similar to selection of alliance or horde). Examples: Mage teleport, druid teleport, UBRS has a quest that allows you teleportation from winterspring to WPL/Scholo, 2 engineering gadgets, horde teleport to Gnomeregan from booty bay, alliance use of zeppelins/horde use of alliance boats, maybe a "set hearthstone location to a point".  The reason is that you may miss something if you got access to these things... 
---
Example 1: say I'm a horde mage and I'm Kargath going stratholme, is it faster to teleport undercity and fly to EPL, or fly from kargath to EPL? If it was faster to teleport, it should change my start location/incorporate it.
---
Exampel 2: I'm an alliance druid and going scholomance (chillwind) currently placed in Dire Maul. Is it faster than 8-10 minutes to teleport moonglade, take FP winterspring, run up the mountain, and teleport to scholomance? 
---
Second wish would be a run time on mount, and then add travel nodes to dungeons. E.g. alliance guilds (on pservers at least) use onyxia head in stormwind and fly to burning steppes (3 minutes), then run to MC/BWL.  A portal to ironforge and fly thorium point is 1 minute (maybe an extra 1 minute to get through the portal and to the FP). But how much longer does it take for a mount to get from burning steppes to MC instead of Thorium point to MC?
---
With both I could be a horde mage in Dire maul and just set "dire maul &gt; Zul'Gurrub" and it would tell me Teleport orgrimmar &gt; Zeppelin Grom'gol &gt; run ZG: Eta 14 minutes\~. Disregarding zeppelin wait time, I would also have a good expentency of when I arrive, so I could be there pit perfect on raid start. \*Drools\*
---
My guess is alliance will be the dominant faction.
---
They don't mind them dumping all over the place since that bat guano is so valuable. We even get guano quests from RFK just to get the stuff.
---
There's literally zero chance rag isn't dead in under 2 weeks, and more than likely 1 week depending on when server reset is.
---
you probably said that sarcastically, but it actually kind of is.  i've been playing rogue for years and you spend more time in stealth than you do out of it.  that jerky shitty stealth animation that OP showed us reeks of retail. gross.  please  change back blizzard &lt;3
---
So my point exactly is to add to this new release of Classic the patches and fixes that would fix that fundamental flaw that “Classic wasn’t designed for the expansions they have release”
---
resisting the HoJ from one of the pallys was lucky though.
---
Nope just bnet account. Don't think they will send out invites after may 30 so just wait for that and let it sink in we have 90 days to wait.
---
You're assuming with no basis of truth that microtransactions account for more than subscriptions. Mictrotransactions are something a player may spend money on once or twice in their playing career, where as subs are collected for each and every player on a monthly basis. Comparing money brought in from both you'll find that subscriptions are what generate the vast majority of revenue.
---
All great points! I agree whole heartily. And then you factor in little things like talent points where each point eventually stacks to 5/5 or 3/3 or the amazing 1/1 where it just profoundly alters the way you'll level and also interact with players and dungeons.
---
And then there's spell ranks and 'choosing' which ones to skip in order to save money for blues or mounts. And there's professions (to either skip or level while leveling). And there's SECONDARY professions. Oh, so much. Can't wait.
---
people not from the US
---
&gt;They're manually selecting who they want to take into the beta
---
It's not manual, based on what they've said. The blue post said: "The system periodically and automatically selects random accounts which meet our criteria". Something along those lines.
---
They may have cherry picked the notable streamers, but us average folks are just needles in a haystack.
---
Yeah this is definitely the majority of players that will be playing classic. I would hesitate to guess less then \~20% of players will be retail players (after the initial launch rush dies down). Blizzard probably realizes this too and is a major reason why this is even happening. It's a chance to bring people back and boost sub numbers. If it just poached retail players I really doubt Classic would be releasing at all
---
Sure, [here's the e-mail that a GM sent to Savix,](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DyH6vZ3UwAIdd1Z.jpg:large) showing that he was suspended for **win-trading**, not because he got “mass reported” (which nobody was even able to prove happened, btw.
---
I'm too lazy to dig up the Bluepost that confirmed that you cannot be suspended through an automated process, but maybe I should considering the amount of smooth-brained circlejerkers appearing on this sub all of a sudden.
---
RIP Velious armor textures.
---
I would prio stam, int, then spirit.  2 or 4 strength does nothing for you while leveling.  Its about sustenance while leveling
---
Hold on, are you talking 6-7 months total for phase 1 and 2 or 6-7 months each of phase one and two?
---
&gt;People will have more time to farm MC/Ony, and more casual people get a chance to level up and get in on the fun.
---
You know half of the good items in MC won't come out until phase 2 right? 
---
&gt;There is basically no upside to rushing content except for the pvp implementation (as people have pointed out pvp without battlegrounds can't last too long or it would be a nightmare).
---
There isn't a lot to do with no pvp system and just Ony/MC out that will be cleared in one night (or half a night) for most guilds.
---
&gt;This is a long term game, not a rush because of an expansion that may or may not ever be made.
---
It's not about an expansion, it's about there simply not being a whole lot to do with just MC/Ony at endgame. There needs to be a balance between more hardcore and more casual players in terms of content release and having 12 months of just MC ain't it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev-cy000SaM&amp;t=3s
---
They are welcome to grab my cash for putting out this content whether it is lazy or not. I’m subbing for classic wow, I would have never subbed for bfa
---
This subreddit sucks. Blizzard has the actual code and yet some neckbeards on reddit think they have better memory than a computer.
---
Yep it happened to me last month, I flew under most of Draenor.
---
https://imgflip.com/i/31vu31
---
&gt; You're assuming with no basis of truth that microtransactions account for more than subscriptions.
---
No I'm not. No one without a sub is buying microtransactions. Microtransactions PLUS a subscription is always going to be more than just a subscription.
---
don't worry, IF will happen naturally when people start raiding. 0 reason to even be in SW at that point.
---
Yeh IF was definitely the main "hub" back in the days because it was closer to Blackrock Mountain and Menethil Harbor. It will be fun to see how this plays out.
---
Everquest was before my time but I did have older cousins whom I know did play. That sounds true though and I'm glad Blizzard had that vision because now it's being recreated for a *second time* because a significant portion of the playerbase wants it!
---
So... This would be a fresh server... in which case... A duo of mages leveling to aoe farm while their friends level warlocks to summon them to new aoe farming spots. The rest will just farm gold and mats for professions. 
---
All in all if you get everything perfect.. probably 3 days maybe under 3 if you optimize it.
---
That said the point of classic isn't really to get to 60 first. But more to take it slow and enjoy the walk. which is why most people take a few weeks.
---
Don't be mad I live in Capitalist America Comrade.  The land where you can make enough money to live and have fun!  The EU jealousy line starts over there in France.
---
Reading through this" https://www.reddit.com/user/cyatir makes me laugh.  So much anger that others want to have fun a different way than he deems to be legit.  It is too bad Blizzard doesn't give a fuck about your opinion.
---
Nah, the bigger problem is people thinking private servers were ever actually good
---
They were just good enough
---
chats fault ofc
---
This could likely be because of the 30 meta, at 60 players are more likely to want to be near Scholo, Strath and BRD/BRS so natrually IF would become the Alliance capital once more.
---
Remember who you're asking... this sub is never going to say that classic isn't the best thing ever. The question is "will I have fun with limits on how much time I can spend". Here's some helpful considerations:
---
*It takes a good 120+ hours to reach level 60. If you enjoy classic leveling, that can be a plus; if you're just here for end-game, that can be a minus.  
---
*Classic dungeons/raids can be lengthy experiences. If you just want to play in half-hour or hour-long sessions, that makes a lot of content harder to arrange. If you plan on binging on weekends instead, it's easier to fit time in.  
---
*Some content is up your alley, some isn't. What will your playtime look like? Running 5-mans or older raids, world pvp, auction house flipping, messing around, etc?
---
**The best way to see if you enjoy it is to try it**. No one can tell you if you'll enjoy X. Perhaps look into a private server &amp; dabble in some things, see if it's up your alley... because asking r/classicwow if classic is worth buying is a futile question. Of course they love it...
---
He needs to fuck his other Achilles just in time for launch.
---
Thank you! 🙏
---
I played in 2004..... Now I have a job, wife, kids, house and no time to play lel! I'll be lacking sleep when it comes out...
---
You're correct, it is definitely supposed to port you back to wherever the BG was queued from.
---
Unfortunately, none of the big streamers seem to be actually recognizing and reporting issues like this.
---
&gt; So my point exactly is to add to this new release of Classic the patches and fixes that would fix that fundamental flaw that “Classic wasn’t designed for the expansions they have release”
---
That means completely redesigning Classic from the ground up. Are you really saying that?
---
To delete Classic and rebuild it and changing the itemization, group-making, class-design, instance-design, flow, leveling speed, etc. to take into account multiple future expansions-worth of content?
---
I don't think you understand what it means to redesign something from scratch.
---
Seriously, what do you think is more likely? Blizzard putting 70% of a realms population behind a que or just saying “we’ll keep layering it has worked out so far”. 
---
It’s obvious some realms will have layering even after phase 1.
---
Agreed! I didn't know anything about D&amp;D when I played vanilla oh so long ago but when I have the time, I like hop on roll20 (have been doing so now for over 4 years!) and explore so many adventures with friends.
---
But now, this time around with Classic, it feels different because of my D&amp;D knowledge, how I want to interact with the world and players (my class and spec, heals, dps and tank) and what I envision for myself during leveling and at 60.
---
Storm wind has **always** been popular for the newbies. At 60 it’ll be IF.
---
Oh yeah? I just checked my email and had a stress test invite under promotions. I'm downloading it now but of course, No Realms are currently available. :( :(
---
You misunderstand. I never meant to imply they fee was not within reason given how few people got the pattern for it.
---
100g for a fee to craft a single item is still absolutely insane in itself regardless of circumstances.
---
That the most obvious thing I've ever seen a person type out. It still doesn't support your argument or the nonsensical logic you're using as a foundation at all.
---
Oh yessssss indeed but wants your level 30 things get a little easier with jobs.
---
What kind of retard would downvote me for answering a simple question?
---
Retail has realm forums so i dont see a reason as to why classic wouldnt
---
Originally it was the main hub because there was no auction house in Stormwind.
---
So what does an rpg boss fight feel like then?
---
Solid reply, very thought through and informative.
---
Back in the day those of us with terrible internet connections hung out in Stormwind - the lag was better, lol!
---
I still have some of mine too! Mine looks way more worn then yours tho. Those look so pristine!
---
Absolutely. Leaving a BG should put you back next to the battle master wherever you queued up.
---
It’s a bug and should be reported and fixed.
---
&gt;If on a 10k pop server only 3 had it, then it fully deserved the gold fee.
---
While I agree with this. 100g is still an absurd crafting fee.
---
They're probably here to talk about classic, and tired of this sub being r/fuckretailreee
---
No, the plans can drop from UBRS, and possibly other similar level dungeons, as well.
---
You're still talking about specs as if they existed in Classic. There's no such thing as specs in Classic.
---
There are classes.
---
In Retail there are 36 individual classes (because they can't dip into any other talents.)
---
Nobody is threatened by classic.
---
If anything, this can have a good impact on the retail game.
---
Which i'd approve. 
---
The negatives on the other hand; implementation of a ship and gold token.
---
Wait you didn't hit 120 in 1 sitting? Have fun in classic friend at least leveling in classic is more enjoyable
---
I mean who gives up on an expansion 2 days into it though, if they were a huge fan of the last one. Most people gave bfa atleast a week lol and we all knew that was gonna suck from the beginning
---
Here ya go. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVSJ0AvZe0
---
I mean I thought this at first, but realistically if we say there's 3,000 people per layer (server) that's \~500 people on average per starting zone. That's a lot of people in one small starting zone.... almost hard to comprehend really. 
---
Maybe they're going to create much smaller layers at first? Say 1,000 people? Idk..
---
Last year Blizzard reported that more than half their revenue comes from in-game transactions. It's the new model of game development. Blizzard and their shareholders aren't looking to turn back the clock to a day before subs+MTs, they want both streams.
---
Time to drop out for a semester or 6.
---
I sadly resigned with the slim hope I get a beta invite. # gotem
---
My mistake, I came here to enjoy one game, not to circlejerk against another
---
Projecting?
---
I fly to Japan for a two week vacation only a few days after the game releases. I feel ya.
---
Oh god. Seeing that screenshot took me back. I’m curious about WoW again but younger me is yelling NOT AGAIN
---
Naw. That's authentic Vanilla experience. I plan on making a rogue only to kill and camp lowbies. PVP problems have PVP solutions.
---
Surprised to not see any Green Whelp armors going on, its 30 req and only requires LW 175 or something like that.
---
Think it would be massive and rage inducing for these premades lol.
---
He/she talked about private servers, so economy might be different.
---
Reroll
---
Yes you are right, this is also a factor that i forgot to mention.
---
There isnt on in Classic wow either I believe
---
Yeah, even on pservers theres people who have never played vanilla and don’t know the strats. All it takes is one person to not run the bomb out on geddon. One person to be knocked into the whelps (50 DKP MINUS!!!) on onyxia. Only one tranq shot for magmadar the first time.
---
For the pserver guilds that stay together it’ll be easy. For people who legit haven’t played vanilla since 06 it may not be as easy.
---
What class are you running and alliance or horde
---
You're right. There are a lot more completely clueless and irrational people out there, too!
---
Beta is first and foremost to test. Secondary is marketing. And even the "marketing" aspect (streamers) will get hundreds of thousands of eyeballs on the game, also testing it.
---
Individually, YOU bring nothing to the table. This isn't about loyalty. It's not customer service. And there are perhaps MILLIONS of people who "HAVE put the time and work into the vanilla wow grind, don't have access" ...
---
What you REALLY mean is that YOU wish YOU were invited. Because you have to be smart enough to understand why they can't invite every single player from that vanilla grind, right???? And why inviting popular streamers benefits their game and company way more than inviting randos like you.... right????????????
---
If I were hiring QA for a game, you know what two mandatory criteria I would NOT have on the list? 1) The played the game before and 2) The player was &lt;insert irrelevant age&gt; when &lt;insert irrelevant game launch&gt;.
---
They did actually confirm beta invites are not first come first server, but that account age is considered when they issue invites: https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=179883&amp;region=us
---
Jealous. aim to get to atleast 45 and well into your proffessions with that!
---
Thank you very much! This is exactly what I’m looking for
---
So make an alliance Druid?
---
You need to cast Blessing of Penicillin on it.
---

---
I would totally buy the shirt on the right and wear it the whole first week I'm taking off work.
---
Come on brother, you know you want to ! My younger self is like YES PLEASE, going back to the real deallll
---
I play mainly horde, but I don't hate Alliance. Why do you dislike horde?
---
And that was relevant how?
---
I'm super casual so I could be wrong, but aren't the 16 debuff slots on raid bosses prohibitive for many Warlocks?
---
If people haven’t played since 06 it’s not gonna be as easy.
---
Great find. Blizzard - WHY would you change this? It’s like you’re purposely trying to make the game worse. Damn you for everything you’ve done to the incredible world.
---
It's not because shamans can keep it up more often, hunters are the best for that actually. The reason is that enhancement dps is so trash that reducing it even further with nightfall is a negligible difference.
---
Don't forget that if you play melee as horde you are not just 1 person who need to play good. If your shaman sucks you loose a lot of dps. Literally like 80% of alla shamans don't know how to play their class. As alliance you get pally buffs then it's all on you. ezmode indeed
---
As much as I love [X], I recognize that not everyone will enjoy [X]. Some people will just prefer [Y], and that's OK
---
who fucking cares about the gryphons/win riders. As long as the flight paths aren't longer nobody, except you, give a flying fuck about it. 99% of people will be alt tabbed or doing something else and not watching a bird fly you to your location.
---
Reasons are entirely aesthetic
---
My plan was to go enchanting or herbalism / alchemy. But i feel like they are only good if you are lucky enough to get Some rare patterns from raids etc.
---
I haven’t played beta, so your comment could very well be true. I just remember that long queues on overpopulated servers were a common norm during vanilla for me.
---
At a reported 0.02%, I'm not sure I trust it.
---
Even if it were true, that means a server would have to run UBRS 23,000 times for a 99% chance that someone on the server has the plans. In comparison, at 113 Onyxia kills, it's a 99% chance someone on the server has the plans.
---
WoW is a pretty steep learning curve the first time around. It’ll test the relationship 😜
---
- Raids
---
- Get the best gear you can get
---
- Max professions 
---
- buy the 1k gold mount
---
- farm rep for another races mount
---
- farm pvp ranks
---
- farm twink items for a low level alt
---
- help people through low level dungeons 
---
There's a lot to do, most of it is farming.
---
There is, it's behind where the current retail AH is. Entrance is around the corner from the modern one.
---
Should have an option for original release and pservers no life.
---
I was always more interested in the aesthetics of the game vs actual gameplay. I still had a fun time even if I was super casual (minimal raiding, mostly pvp). I had a blast playing moonkin during wotlk and then a warrior during cata, mop and legion.
---
But all those later expansions were starting to modernize and ease up certain 'not accessible to all players' content with badge gear, flying or LFR (all major gameplay shifts on Blizzards part) but little did Blizzard know how drastically it would alter their game...like destruction of server identity and immersion breaking.
---
But now, we're finally going home. Things will be a little different but at least I can play it officially, instead of wondering *when* and *if* I'm going to be shut down.
---
Makes me even more mad that they lie to us saying no servers like they don't know twitch is a thing, should say "you don't have access noob gfys" lol but really I want it to be August already don't care for betas too much I'll report a few bugs but I don't like losing progress so I don't play them too much
---
Well, my girlfriend doesnt love that i play game but she accepts it. She didnt start dating me for my gaming addiction... Tbh i dont know why the fuck shes been with me for over 10 years but im truly grateful for it.
---
Twitch chat is that friend who you told an excellent one off joke to.  That friend loved the joke so much they use it whenever they can, when it makes sense but is extremely predictable thus losing it's juice, or when it makes no sense but the friend forces it anyways.  It's the same joke every fucking time in both scenarios and this goes on for years.

Not to be a butt, but... You want us to link you YouTube videos so you don't have to type in "wow horde mounts" in YT search bar?
---
I came over from Everquest during the Classic beta, but I played SUPER casually because I was in high school at the time, and I wasn't really a no-lifer kinda guy yet.  
---
After I graduated, I went hard no-life from BC through WotLK, and then became a filthy casual again from Cata onward.
---
It would be, except it's not the case in beta. I couldn't fly from Grom'Gol to Undercity until I got the Kargath flighpath
---
Hmm I dont know if I could acurately describe it.
---
I think the main problem I have is that whole bosses are scripted.  You know what happens exactly when.
---
Remember the onyxias breath meme? I think when boss abilities would be more randomised and not just a set order everytime, it would go a long way.
---
Hard to define a boss batttle tho, since those differ depending if its turnbasef etc.
---
Linked. Only  the goblin AHs are separate, and they're cross-faction.
---
Note I didn't say anything about changing it just stating that it looks back. So put it back in your pants pal.
---
The new animation doesn't have the feet skate around- the feet actually plant such that the body's translation over the terrain is correct with the motion.  The old one looks like the character has ice skates on and is a sign of poor animation skills.  
---
Yes, it's nostalgic, but it's also objectively animating wrong.
---
You'll still have a blast despite maybe not being to devote as much time to stuff as others :).
---
Im not saying it shouldnt be the sliding, i think that it should.
---
Im saying that he could have played vanilla and still think it looks awful.
---
Probably my favorite part of this addon apart from deleting excessive Soulshards and the summoning messages in party, is how you can assign a keybind to the "curse" feature itself.
---
So regardless of whether or not the raid asks you to use Elements, Shadow or Curse of Recklessness, they will all have the same bind.
---
Rogue, not rouge.
---
A fraction of cost ? Really, a fraction of cost ? Are you that dumb to think that classic is that cheap ?
---
&gt; Just play whatever you like
---
I see this comment a lot on this reddit. I never saw it anywhere where people actually play vanilla though...
---
The link seems to be broken. Do you have another?
---
Mine starts the 20th, rip
---
**Armorsmith** will most likely be one of the Warrior Tanks in guild, since you need help from gbank to get the dark iron fire restistance set. And Lionheart helm is a raiddrop. And protpaladins cant raid since you have no taunt, and you need that to raid as a tank.  
---
**Weaponsmith** is decent, but its same there Nightfall is reputation that comes from raiddrops. But you can get Annihilator and Arcanite Reaper if you farm LBRS alot, but thats not an instance that is easy as a protpaladin.
---
Wait till the game launches. There will be a ton of people advertising for guilds. The only way you really know your guild mates is if you are currently playing with then on undocumented servers.
---
lol what are you smoking? All the top comments are insulting retail
---
His best one is this https://youtu.be/2z29Rk8814w
---
I like how the nature classic auto filters out all the people who don't like honest hard work, nice
---
Lmao how? He gave his opinion without resorting to insults or anything.
---
People on this sub don't even playon retail yet hate on it 24/7
---
The fucking hyopcrisy
---
It’s her first time around with no MMO experience? Roll PVE.

ah okay, didn’t know the difference. Thanks

any want to duo with me instead? I am open to a lot of classes and race combos.

i am NA-WEST and i like to PvP/raid
---
For like everything? The look of the Cities / towns and character models (orc, undead, tauren, troll?)
---
sure buddy
---
Imagine getting so riled up about this comment. This sub is fucking ridiculous
---
&gt; or incentivized to convert Classic players over to Retail.
---
That's the very reason Blizzard is releasing classic again. Lot's of people will come back for classic, but eventually they will try out retail and stick to it.
---
As long as they don't make it cross server shards it'll be fine. The problems are when a server can never make its own community because you never see the same people.
---
feelin hot, hot, hot
---
You can actually go to the Item ID page on Classic WoWhead and click "View In 3D", which loads a model of that mount. At the bottom of the new window, there's a drop-down to view all the animations, including mount special animations if they have them.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15290/brown-kodo, for example.
---
I’m not concerned with how viable my class is in a particular situation. I only mentioned it because certain gear has stats that will be more or less geared towards Paladins.
---
Nice blog.
---
So what if the rest of your friends are horde and you want to play with them but you can’t because you’re on a wait list you hope will eventually allow you to make that character.
---
My friend's dad told me this was 100% real back in the day. Hah, knew I was right in it being fake. Take that, Lars!
---
Definitely a great one
---
&gt; The only sub 4 day clears have been on non fresh private servers with broken quest xp values.
---
You're regurgitating a myth yourself lmao.
---
The broken quest xp values have been fixed for a while.
---
Back in the day I usually took 15-20 to UBRS :/  but that was prior to MC
---
Suggestion: add support for cities/towns without transportation.
---
e.g. the first thing I tried was Darnassus and was confused as to why it wasn't showing up -- then remembered I needed to search Rut'theran Village. It would be cool if I could select Darnassus and the first step was "take the portal to Rut'theran village", etc.
---
(or as a much simpler change, add aliases... Darnassus == Rut'theran Village, Crossroads == Ratchet, etc.)
---
Theres a good secrete mountain pass from redridge to Swamp of Sorrows too! It's already on YouTube so I wont make a video of it.
---
Same launcher, duh
---
Doesn't make sense. Look how hyped everyone is? They want the hype and suspense to build, so everyone plays on Launch. If they let a bunch more people play now, then the hype will probably die down a bit. They even got tons of people to sub just for a chance to get into beta, and those people are still going to wait for launch
---
That’s a good thing tho, this game has so much potential
---
Here's a thought, how about we just play the class we want, and not care about the meta?
---
Yeah if a hoj landed or the lock feared he'd be super dead.
---
That's what makes leveling in classic so fun though. Mobs can straight shit on you if you pull more than 1. In BFA i can pull 15 mobs and AoE them down and not even be at half HP. Theirs no risk, It's just all reward unless you raid or do mythic+ at a high level.
---
Played in 04 and still go to school everyday, only now I am the teacher.
---
Last I checked their retail numbers are at an all time low to begin with. It'll be an extreme long shot to try to convert legacy players to be interested in the current game since it at this point shares so little with what they want out of a game. They try to bring retail back to it's legacy then they risk losing even more of their already dwindling playerbase without a guarantee these older players will join retail is.
---
As in, taking turns who tanks, heals, dps.
---
You seem to think rag will be 1 phase killed in the first week or something...
---
I am willing to be the 1phase rag kills had BWL+AW gear.
---
I play Horde, always have, but I will concede that Alliance has overall better-looking races. I think Orcs and UD are god-tier tho.
---
I didn’t say redesign, I said change the things we know were broke or change the things they can. I never said delete? Where are these words coming from my dude
---
Aww cute, a stalker ! 
---
Please tell me more about how a large % of americans having fun on a lousy minimum wage. Meanwhile here in Europe, ive worked a few years, and at august, Im gonna take a whole year break from work to have fun :) even if i get fat and diabetes, my country will help me. Yours will leave you to rot or be in debt rest of your life to greedy medical companies... Ahh the great and Almighty America ! Ohh and btw, doing some research myself the last few hours, ive learned that blizz tale a much harder stance on multiboxers than previously. My opinion does matter apparently :)
---
I quit my job was gonna start looking in July now I'm thinking not...
---
questionable game design like...having to drink after 3-4 mobs because you depleted all your energy and need to refuel?
---
questionable game design like literally having no self heal abilities besides leveling first aid to reduce downtown after killing 1-2 mobs?
---
questionable game design like not being able to tank certain bosses or not having my HOTs stack with other druids or spamming remove poison during certain fights...oh wait, I'm a druid and can do all three over the course of ONE raid.
---
All that just sounds like somewhat tedious but albeit flavourful interactions with the game world and that's what I'm looking forward to with Classic the most.
---
Then there is better proffesions as a protpaladin, like Alchemy or Engineering. it will help you with your tanking.  
---
And you can just farm Deathbone Set from Scholo, [https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=124](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=124)
---
&gt; while serious players nit-pick every decision
---
This one sounds familiar *for some reason.*
---
And Blizzard will say: Hmmm, we have all these subscribers not giving us more money through microtransactions (which is over half our yearly revenue), what should we do? 
---
And the shareholders will say: Give them microtransactions!
---
Cause PvE didn't exist before the beta lmao
---
It's why they're implementing layering with smaller sizes.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Blizzard is making things as accessible as possible within reason.
---
Is meme
---
This is why Hunters fall off in Naxx. Ranged dps, Tank, Melee dps, main tank healer, caster, main tank resser, ooc resser.
---
you aint getting into the beta.
---
think if I make a guild in classic it's gonna be &lt;Tilted Gryphons&gt;
---
A PvP server will push her away immediately, I guarantee that
---
I said I wasn’t concerned with being viable or a meta choice, just which versions of blacksmithing would benefit myself and my guild the most.
---
It's certainly a difficult needle to thread, sure, but if you think Blizzard isn't having meetings on how best to increase revenue from Classic players through in-game purchases, you're delusional.
---
But it makes no sense.  I get that people prefer that... But they literally fixed it not broke it.  Characters shouldn't slide half a step every step just because it looks "smooth" like someone moonwalking... He's just regular walking it should look like regular walking and then sped up for sprinting.
---
1g is always the portal cost. Always.
---
There aren't beginning zones per say. Every zone levels with you. It would be like fighting in the barrens, and everything is level 60
---
now now, be patient lil' classic...3 months is but a small amount in the sands of time.
---
Crossroads, Tarren Mill, Camp Turajo, Freewind Post (iirc - Thousand Needles camp).
---
Over half of their revenue? This is definitely bullshit. Where's the link
---
Should just make stealthed rogues not able to see themselves.  Solves the problem.
---
How tf do you think Savix was banned? 
---
The enemy team mass reported him for win-trading. He streamed the entire RBG, he wasn’t win trading.
---
Stone talon I believe
---
The glide/smoothness of the old undead rogue animation (as in video) is just too good.
---
I guess we may not get it back if they don't have the old animation on archive. They'd have to recreate it and that might not be in the cards. But I really hope!
---
I tried a couple searches with no luck, I’m also not sure if the animations have changed post-classic. 
---
If they haven’t it certainly becomes a lot simpler.
---
hopefully someone will post this to blizzard and let them know about it, because if it was that way back in 2004-2006, they should let it stayed that way and not change it
---
Retail and the fact that 1.12 has linked AH has led to SW becoming almost a duel capital with IF on pservers. Id say its probably 2/3s IF and and 1/3 SW. 
---
SW is honestly just much worse for a few reasons, with only a few good reasons. Every 60 dungeon is closer to IF with the exception of ZG. Everything except Burning Steppes and south of it as well as the Barrens are closer to IF. IF has a better Bank/AH location, battkemaster location and closer dueling area. The only reason to go to SW is for PvP gear once a week, the Moonwell (it is actually a good hearth for tailors tbh) and Head turn ins.
---
This is good, I thin you should  swap to a class that doesn’t get cheated on. XD
---
Also stonetalon.
---
I'm not saying they aren't it's just my opinion that they shouldn't
---
Nice, thank you very much!
---
NA-East I'll be going gnome  prot warrior for fun.  
---
But, my schedule will be sporadic.   Family, kids, all that stuff.
---
It has been confirmed multiple times now that blizzard wants layering gone by phase 2. 
---
I wouldn't worry about it, they're gonna find the right amount of servers and server sizes. 
---
The classic dev team seemed much more confident and determined to make the right calls than original team 2. 
---
And they did deliver on it so far. Don't worry they got this.
---
you missed his point. The AH in stormwind wasnt added until a later patch
---
I answered that. But still it does not change the fact, that your guild will most likely want those things on a class that can raid or are actually useful as a class/specc.  
---
Boosting a Protpaladin with mats equal to hundreds maybe thousands of gold, i dont see that beeing a smart thing to do as a guild.
---
Woah there, calm down with those totally harsh but 100% true words! /jk
---
I used to play 10-day trials back as a youngling (made new e-mails to consistently make new accounts) and I kept doing it because the community was amazing.
---
I was learning English, learning early social cues, the art of working hard for reward (xp), and I was adding my IRL friends who had a sub to PM them in-game because I was curious what they were up to in-game, if they could show me the high level places.
---
It was fuckin’ magical, and the WoW Classic culture that seems to be breeding here now is reliant on socially interacting in-game and it seems even more rewarding now that things will be harder. (I wouldn’t know the past, I never properly played the game beyond my 10-day trials).
---
Sub is required to be picked for beta
---
LMAO. I would sit here and try to defend classic... instead....
---
GIT GUD.
---
Sure, but there's no 2v2 play mode in vanilla so...
---
Ohh I see. For me shatter means shatter combo for mages.
---
&gt;I mean look at the playable combo, specc and class distribution in BC in the top 50 teams in 2s. 
---
&gt;And dont forget the manaburn,drain, vipernsting fun. 
---
&gt;It's actually sad.
---
I'm not sure what your point is here. I mean you can't deny that more classes and specs are viable for TBC than they are for vanilla. So that argument is not really great here. Besides, I have checked the most popular TBC arena server's current ladder and in the top50 teams have 9 classes represented, various characters of each. 
---
Btw, almost any class could achieve 25% crit, which is the resil cap (and nbody achieves that anyways). 
---
I get that it has downsides, and I also get why Blizzard implemented it. There might have been a more optimal solution, but I don't think it ruined the game.
---
we're talking about post classic content dude  
---
get on with the average IQ in this thread, you're below
---
Good insight, chief.
---
You need to be subbed to have a chance at getting invited to the beta.
---
Unlikely to get in as they said the amount of invites going out is decreasing.
---
Waiting an hour will probably be worse. Either jump Right in, or wait 2-3 days.
---
are they still picking people?
---
Which is probably why I literally gave the context of wPvP so....
---
TBH they probably want it that way so they can be higher on the list
---
So I guess you are NA? Europans get 4-5 payed vacation during the summer.
---
I've been noticing some naysayers in twitch chats too. They seem really anxious to be right about their classic predictions. I've seem some saying it will fail and be a ghost town within 3 months. Some others are saying it won't even get .01% of Live WoW's numbers.
---
I just ignore it because the proof will come. Debating them in a chat won't change their minds. They'll just have to see it. As long as I can log in, I don't care what other people are doing.
---
Obviously this is not to be taken seriously, just some fun on the Stress Test and editing.
---
Hi, /u/Its_Nuh-go-dee
---
I hope they bring back screenshot of the day, or perhaps this sub could ? Even just a weekly thread would be nice.
---
I cant tick multiple boxes...
---
And also higher ranks of sprint give more speed boost.
---
If you're here for thoughtful debate on what could have been a good change... you're in the wrong sub. The average voter here is hostile to the idea of changes.
---
Yeah. I loved classic and I haven't been a big fan of the last couple expansions personally. 
---
However there are a few quality of life fixes that I am going to miss while playing classic.
---
You said it yourself, refresh every 2ish years.  It's the vanilla experience people enjoy.
---
&gt;You're still talking about specs as if they existed in Classic. There's no such thing as specs in Classic. There are classes with talent trees. 
---
Lmao imagine being this much of a pedantic ass.  
---
Also that's simply false. Different specs had different and unique spells only given to that spec.  
---
&gt;In Retail there are 36 individual classes (because a Shadow Priest can't choose to take Holy Priest talents and vice-versa.)  
---
Neither can you do the same in classic for the most part because you ran out of talent points before you get to the most meaningful talents.
---
I hate how Blizz launches stuff around Labor Day weekend all the time. I go to Dragon*Con every year, so I can never take extra time off for this stuff. If I had any PTO to spare this year I would.
---
I'm pretty sure they haven't changed in any (at least major) way. This might help:
---
https://youtu.be/cRwWDs1s2_o
---
Right. I said you can't sit proc. So that does take away from some of the potential fun. Reckoning is still very powerful in PvE and PvP. Can also go reckoning and SoC at like lvl 47 ish.
---
Awesome job! Always loved creative use of the pet stay command and bouncing a mob between your pet's location and the hunter using FD.
---
I didn't camp any lowbies cause it's a waste of my time.  There's so much shit I need to do for raiding for pvp rank or professions or sometimes an alt.  Why would I sit in redridge?
---
Note this was different way back in the day when there was no pvp ranks and MC was on farm.  The Hillsbrad Foothills wars were fucking epic.
---
Anyways just complain in Local Defense and usually someone will come to your aid on a 60.  I'm always on the lookout for time wasting dirtbags who I can wipe the floor with.
---
This is the channel. Does this work? [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo8fiUlLClopUYom0bqpevQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo8fiUlLClopUYom0bqpevQ) It's the newest video on there.
---
Oh boy i loved the heroics of release cata.
---
Was really a shame they nerfed those bc people got so used to facerolling them in wotlk.
---
Because half of the battle of beating a specific boss should be about progressing to a gear level that allows you to do so. Not following a bunch of steps as if you are playing Assassin's Creed. You can keep those action-adventure boss fights for Retail and pretend it's hard, but I personally don't want to see that shit in Classic.
---
https://www.techspot.com/news/73230-over-half-activision-blizzard-716-billion-yearly-revenue.html
---
All those combos and you don't list the most powerful of them all?
---
Paladin warrior
---
This ^^
---
yep, that's one reason why I'm not playing alliance, sw sucks
---
Been playing a healing priest since vanilla, but Hunter is so appealing to me with their soloing ability. Just worried I'd have to get used to waiting to find a group for dungeons lmao
---
with the inclusion of wow tokens, 64% of blizzards profit came from microtransactions last year.  googke it, hes not wrong.
---
PvE servers exist
---
Unfortunately it won't because 2004 was 15 years ago. It's silly to think that it might've been 'the community you remember'.
---
It'll be similar, that's for sure and I think the $15/month will weed out A LOT of pserver players (who are toxic in the own right). I'd rather deal with an entitled retail player whose gonna learn fast (or not at all) when they get blacklisted because they are a) an insufferable asshole, b) ninja looting constantly, c) a whiny PoS over /2 or d) all of the above. It just means, sure I'll give you another chance possibly at some point in the leveling process for group content but if it continues, /ignore and move on.
---
weapon swap to do what exactly?
---
It was in all of vanilla, your claim that they "fixed" something is absurd.
---
64%, google it, its easy to find
---
true
---
More like, I enjoy RPG mechanics and don't like modern boring anti-social action-adventure stuff.
---
ok, show me a sub 4 day clear that is applicable in this case.
---
this is dope
---
Also... another thing. Level with Blessing of Wisdom on. Speeds up leveling much better than Might. And in the ret tree get things like parry 5/5. Sleeper OP. Mitigation and quicker attacks.
---
Stopped first in MoP after learning you had to grind dailies all the time.
---
Why not 5 though
---
There’s a difference between “smooth brained circlejerkers” and people who tend to believe something widely spread as being true.  Now if they continue to believe so when proof is presented otherwise, then sure.
---
I do thank you for the proof though.
---
Savix was at 1600 cr when he was “banned” for win-trading. If you’re going to say “people pay to be carried to 1600” then you’re stupid. 
---
Also you saying you’re that you’re too lazy to search up a bluepost while also saying “I proved you all wrong!” Doesn’t help and only adds to your stupidity.
---
I played EQ for several years, quite a bit before WoW. Then I got into the WoW vanilla beta way back in the day. One of my first thoughts was "They are tackling a bunch of my biggest complaints about EQ". And that really hooked me.
---
Don't get me wrong, losing XP and your gear remaining on your corpse upon death are fine for EQ. They fit that game. But I was able to focus so much more on other factors when death wasn't like this. I already don't want to die in these MMOs, so why punish me more on top of that. That's how I saw it back then, at least. I do still go back to EQ sometimes though.
---
if you're going to play hemo why not just play swords?
---
serrated blades is very overrated ESPECIALLY for pve
---
Sharding is only temporary and it kind of has to be done if you want to play the game
---
I am almost certain the closed beta was a 'vip list' type, then F&amp;F later.  It was meant for mass consumption, and most of the 'bugs' discovered have not been bugs, and many things are overlooked because the 'vips' are actually quite bad.
---
Luckily it seems like the true testing is happening on the Alpha Realm.  I think blizzard understood this when they made the list, as the beta test directions are exceptionally vague.  
---
In past closed beta's, there was often more directed testing instructions.  It should be obvious to anyone at this point that the systems in need of testing are the actual game systems, and not the values.  
---
As you say, this would require some idea of what it should be.  See some recent discussion over 'hunter pet command lag' when back in the day the hunter pet command was just another spell in the spell batch, like how it is in beta.
---
What do you mean that I don't spawn in as Xxlordbigdick, the Godslayer, Chosen Champion of Azeroth, Lord of the Fleshcaverns, Last Defender of the McGuffin and Khadgar The Shitty Achmage's Personal Errand Boi with my Titanforged Neetbux waiting in my mailbox? Shit game.
---
Is it not growing? Cause I’m just recently hearing about it. It’s fun, but hard af
---
I can't wait for server Discord servers.
---
and hillsbrad
---
&gt; leveling zones camped out by griefers
---
This will 100% guaranteed be the case in phase 2 when we get honor but no bgs until phase 3.
---
fun fact, this was shortly after the release of WoTLK and deathknights were so OP that he kept accidentally killing them in a 1v2 and had to retake that scene a handful of times because of it
---
It's possible. The question then is, if Blizzard adds microtransactions to the game, will it drive enough people away to make it a net loss for investors?
---
Stonetalon Mountains, Ashenvale, Thousand Needles and Hillsbrad Foothills are the 1st zones where the Horde is in the wild, away from the safe zones.
---
Oh yea definitely, local defense you always have that level 60 or high 50ish hero that is bored.
---
Depends if you want to pull your weight / be carried / carry people. There's a huge difference in damage between say, a Ret and Warrior.
---
A few easy examples:
---
Why would I as a Warrior accept someone rolling on gear that benefits me (and thus the overall raid dps) far more, just because they don't care about a "meta"? 
---
As a raid leader, the same applies. Why would you want a someone in the group who is doing 1/4 the damage of someone but also wants the same gear? If you're a super casual don't care guild sure, but I genuinely doubt there will be any of those in a vanilla environment.
---
Me probably
---
This is not an exploit, you can do it with speedpots, mount or anything that makes your movement faster. We did this in vanilla aswell.
---
Not a cheat/exploit. It was part of the game in Vanilla. Anyone can do it if they know how.
---
get the fuck outta here
---
That’s been part of my thinking as well. I figure we’ll have no shortage of armorsmiths. Did you ever mess around with the hammersmithing? Anything cool in that tree?
---
stfu, it's a beta lol.
---
This was possible in vanilla and everybody can do it not just Druids.
---
This is a legitimate strategy and has been used by good players since the beginning of time.
---
&gt; Why did people fall in love with MMOs in the first place? 
---
Because the early 2000s were a much different time than today. Just the idea of an alternative "reality" where you can talk to strangers and play with them was enough of a hook by itself probably. I still remember how exciting it was to reach Stormwind for the first time and see Trade District filled to the brim with other people. Nowadays online games are not rare, talking to strangers on the internet is not rare, there's a million apps and forums you can do that and there's tons of social media apps when all we used to have was myspace and we're constantly connected to the internet through our own personal devices, unlike that one crappy computer the entire family had to share.
---
That's cool, and yea I've been watching alot of videos on YouTube and streams on the living room TV (which she loves......not really) but she thinks the gnome females are cute and wants to be one of them and she likes the idea of pets like a hunter so I told her to be warlock I think she'll have fun with it...at least I hope she does, I just know myself and I am going to want to spend alot of time with WoW so I'm hoping for that slight chance she'll do it with me as something we can do together :)
---
No. You can only play on retail up to 20lvl for free.
---
I really fucking hope you are trolling
---
Mage isn't unable to follow him. He just doesn't try doing it the proper way. Not an exploit by any means
---
War stomp will probably be good as I think it’s your only stun option
---
Is not the beta meant to test bugs?
---
That's a good question. The server I played on that implemented this was ally heavy when they started it. So what would happen, is ally would get queued for an hour or two, and new horde players would make new toons and log in. Once the imbalance swung back over, both would then be open until it swung one way or the other. The advantage of having it from the start, is such a queue would likely rarely exist for more than about 20 minutes.
---
I guess you are NA? Europeans get 4-7 weeks paid vacation depending on country and most will take 4-5 weeks during summer.
---
So how is druid for pvp outside of flag carry? I'm most likely just gonna play 1 char all of classic and am close to settling on feral druid
---
Oh boy, you won't be ready for this... But there are like 10 jumps harder than this one in warsong you can do as a druid. That's only the beginning.
---
some of you people need to go outside, like legit.
---
Yes it did thank you!
---
Fair enough. I'm going to exit this thread now and pretend all of this never happened
---
I've quit late in an expansion a few times, mainly because I don't raid. No time for it really. But WoD and BFA were the two expansions where I quit way earlier, like 2 months in. BFA especially got rid of my "guaranteed pre-order" on anything Blizzard related. I decided maybe it's time to hear more public feedback before buying their products. There's so many games to play now, I can be a picky shopper.
---
Thanks! :)
---
This thread makes me glad I quit during MoP.
---
This is classic sub and you are going to try and criticize/complain about vanilla mechanics :) ?
---
You’re really out of the loop huh
---
Interesting. There's no pet scaling, correct? If not it should be fairly straightforward to calculate the dps increase you can leverage out of this discovery
---
Raiding is so hard that 5 noobs can AFK-kill **the main villain in the WC universe** after a few hours of creating their character.
---
Once again, adding some kinda mechanic like "your tank must jump on this platform and unequip his chest slot for 30 seconds" or whatever these "more mechanics" mean, does not make the raid harder.
---
AQ40 was hard. Naxx was hard. Why? Because you actually had to be geared properly to clear them. You had to manage 40 people. You had to build a community and guild that was conducive towards working together to accomplish those goals.
---
There is nothing "hard" about being teleported to an instance/group and beating Sargeras after a few hours of rolling your character. The fact that I have to explain that is ridiculous.
---
Again, whacking up the difficulty with mythic doesn't mean shit. If you cleared the content and saw the bosses die, then you cleared the content and saw the bosses die. It doesn't matter if you beat it on lower difficulty.
---
No i just meant that in private servers, maybe due to donation, there is more liquid gold going around and so average prices are higher. If that is the case, 100 gold is high but not quite as retail.
---
That is just a guess, however. Private servers are wild.
---
Why are people telling him to reroll when Hpal is the most valuable class in the game.
---
I'm just going to play in class.
---
Well that's the easiest way to deny you were wrong and owe an apology.
---
Was this in BFA?
---
Honestly it's really not bad for that now.
---
The neck catchup mechanic is REALLY aggressive now so you can't really fall behind enough to make it relevant.
---
It's pmuch just do a few islands + 1 M+ every week that's it really.
---
But I get the sentiment for sure :)
---
I'm still confused if this means that anyone with this scepter can get the mount in that 10 hour period, or if only one person can get it - and you just have 40 people be a raid together to give one guy the mount?
---
If they don't like it fine. 
---
As long as Blizzard knows that they are not the intended audience and wont listen to them.
---
The lesson that needs to be learned by modern game companies is when creating a game knowing your targeted audience. Appealing to that specific group with some flexibility that you don't push everyone else away, while also maintaining that appeal and not straying too far from what the group wants.
---
I understand the reasoning behind appealing to a wider audience, how will the game sell if 2% of the gaming population will be the only ones that like it? They want to make money and that's understandable.
---
The problem is going to the opposite side of the spectrum that your game tries to appeal to everyone and sure alot of people might like parts of it but ultimately get bored.
---
Blizzard had a specific image in mind when creating WoW which stemmed from their Warcraft series and love for RPGs and interests in MMOs.
---
They created a perfect storm that was on the perfect spot of that spectrum. Appealing to many without taking away from what that community desired.
---
Over the years they made changes and when they started losing subs because of certain changes (*Glares at LFG/CRZ/LFR*). Instead of trying to rectify the damage done they just did everything they could to regain their losses. 
---
I could go on forever about this but ultimately it boils down to Blizzard sticking to their guns, knowing that Classic is for a specific crowd that loves it to death and anyone else can get out.
---
Otherwise history will just repeat itself.
---
**TL:DR:  Blizzard should ignore these people and focus on the fact that Classic targets a specific community and shouldn't make changes based on what the fools say.**
---
My hobby is hookers, opiates, and alcoholism.  Should my wife support me in this?
---
That's quite alright. After making a fool of myself arguing against welfare epics in \~2006 and against constant level cap increases in \~2009, I am quite alright with looking foolish to you people. Because that often means that I'm right.
---
Could you call him a beta too so i get the complete insult chain for a textbook?
---
I’m so glad university doesn’t start until the end of September for me! So a month to get 60?
---
Last time I was forced to make the choice, I quit the game.
---
But that was back in MOP, when nothing about my characters felt like they were my characters anymore.
---
Blood dps was so much fun. Nothing could kill me
---
People forget vanilla wow was also designed for casual player that's what the devs said back then
---
I wrote an essay to explain this but it got auto deleted cause i mentioned a private server name. GG
---
Am I the only one that says it out loud as "Stone-tuh-lone"?
---
If not for the fun I have doing rp on the server I would be in the same boat.
---
Hi, /u/Lestoli
---
Oh it is noob friendly. Being dumbed down doesnt mean noob friendlier, it just means theres less depth to it.
---
Have you even tried BFA dps rotations? they are alot more complex and difficult than classic ever was, so that alone makes it easier to get into raiding than in bfa... you dont need to have good reaction times when the only thing your doing with some classes in a raid is 1 button while monitoring your class resource.
---
Theres a reason why elder folk enjoyed older wow more than they do currently... there are numerous instances where a middle-aged parent decided to quit wow back in cata+ simply because the game became too fast phased and intense. (had nothing to do with them getting a family... at that point in life they already had one, and might have even played wow with them)
---
Not to say only older folk did this, not everyone enjoys fortnite-style intense gameplay.
---
A 10k queue would probably be many hours of waiting not 30 minutes :p it sure would be fun to come home from work and literally be unable to play because by the time you’re done your queue you have to go to bed. 
---
They would almost definitely add more servers and offer free transfers to the new ones. It would kind of suck to fuck with server communities like that but oh well
---
Probably until may 30 then no papa
---
Isn't the quest neck from RFK bis? Or are you too low level to get the quest?
---
The only thing that can kill wow... is wow.
---
Nonexistent. Just for FC.
---
dang
---
Except that they are great in tanking.
---
An enormous Dragon can turn into a Human and live undetected in Stormwind for years. A living bonfire named Ragnaros can rise up from the ground. Warlocks summon demons from the pits of hell and Druids can shapeshift into various animal forms.
---
But a living corpse sliding around while invisible. CANT HAVE THAT
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about
---
Damn dude....
---
Even if this were an exploit, you should be happy that a big streamer showcases it since that would increase the chances that Blizzard changes/fixes it.
---
But no, you would rather /cry on reddit and make a fool of yourself.
---
Probably because the game comes out in 3 months and this is beta.
---
Yes but at a much slower rate and if you haven't played the game before your account is highly unlikely of being picked.
---
I've been playing since 2006. No invite.
---
I just hate the min/max mentality is all. I get why people are into it. But limiting yourself to one spec because it's the only "Viable" spec is BS, IMO.
---
Then try being a Enh shaman and watching most classes get awesome reworks meanwhile our class which was artificially propped up by Legiondaries and Artifacts have all that stuff removed in BFA...and nothing added to replace it. Then getting told we won't even get a rework the entire expansion (or most of it? just resubbed last week and my talents are still the same as October). Then watch as NO ONE invites you to M+ groups and your IO score falls behind so its even harder to get into M+ groups and your relegated to the shitty wipe-fest or low-key groups because no one wants a broken class (or low IO) in their timed run.
---
That was an actual slap in the face. And I seriously can't believe how little has been added (or changed about Shamans) since I quit in October. By this time in Legion they'd added 3 5 mans (okay I'm counting both Karas), 2 full new raids and a 3 boss mini raid, and a new zone with a ton of quests and side stuff to do and there was ANOTHER new zone on the horizon (Argus).
---
In BFA the only thing they added content-wise is a couple story-line quests that you can do in like 2 hours (minus the 12 hour mission that gates you from finishing the quests), and 1 full raid and a 2 boss mini raid. Thats fucking pathetic in comparison. No new 5 mans. One less raid entirely. No new zones or even hope of a new one in the future.
---
How could they follow up so much with so little? Its nuts.
---
As much as I don't like layering, I don't want to play on an overcrowded place like LH. It was my 2nd Vanilla Pserver, and compared to my 1st cozy lil' french server, it was a nightmare, as OP says !
---
Was druids really able to carry the flag in travel form?
---
That'd be awesome. Classic WoW with high graphics settings is still beautiful.
---
There's 2 ways you can enter a base - up the ramp or through the tunnel.
---
What soda is doing here is not the intended way to play the game and clearly an exploit and he's using this to his advantage, aka cheating.
---
Everyone who disagrees with me is stupid, which seems to be the vast majority here.

---
For the unfortunate people in this thread arguing about Stealth Ranks affecting the results of the comparisons, please watch this videos. Thank you.
---
Have to look at it realistically though. Why would you get brought over someone else who has your gear but does 4x the damage? When your class is also the class that excels in healing too...
---
Again though it depends if you want to do group content or not.
---
From level 1 to 15 it is faster to just kill mobs. So next time, don't be a pleb and try to not do item looting quests and start killing mobs not involved in a quest line.
---
You should post this to the forums, so blizzard can see it.
---
I'm sorry, I think you accidentally linked the wrong video. That one isn't [The Lament of Captain Placeholder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2xuO8JBepM).
---
They absolutely should. They should be as transparent and open as possible. Unfortunately this is Blizzard and that probably won't ever happen.
---
I dont understand what "tilted gryphons" means here.
---
&gt;calling a privat server one original is pretty stupid
---
Yes because animations are a product of the server side code...
---
I noticed in the beta the also gryphon takes a slightly different path around the Great Forge.
---
Maybe, take Shroud and Pubg as an example. 80% of the server drop on the same hotdrop as Shroud leaving you and 19 other people to fight on a map designed for 100 people. 
---
People are negative against streamers in general because it destroys the game design of the game and makes it into something else. It’s up for you to decide if its something you like or not. 
---
Regarding your question I don’t really know, I’m from EU and my favorite streamers are from NA
---
Keep in mind that the animation is accelerated for 100% speed mounts compared to the 60% speed variety.
---
In my opinion, this makes mounts like Kodos look silly because their feet move way too fast its like speedy lizard feet.
---
Wolves on the other hand have a slow stride that looks very nice at 100% speed increase.
---
Could you link when it happened in the streams?
---
ive searched through both asmongolds and sodapoppins clips and not a single one mentions phasing or layering from WSG. Seems odd that no one clipped that if it was obvious phasing.
---
If you can get and lose money fast, the economy isnt being held hostage. That means you're an active participant in the economy and the way from getting and losing money super fast and getting money faster than losing it usually only involves small changes, like when you buy your consumables or spending half an hour before raid getting the herbs so a guildie/one of your characters can make what you need. 
---
His comment implied that goblins somehow have a stranglehold on the economy. That is not possible because absolutely anyone can get the most profitable item type in the game - BoE's from running raids.
---
Now you can instead complain about bots
---
Fuck bots.
---
I guess you are NA? We crazy Europeans get 4-7 weeks paid vacation depending on country. Personally I get 5 and have a legal right to get 4 in a row during summer.
---
You can't say BfA sucks if you never even played it.
---
I always felt a bunch of classes really come online at 40 thanks to unlocking different armor class, mount, and getting that sweet 31st talent point. 
---
Warrior is a big example for that. You can finally wear plate, you get a new attack, you get a spell interrupt that you don’t need a shield for. Then again that’s a little late in the game, for most you get an idea earlier
---
Unless your a lowbie. Most 60's didn't mind if you just gave them ten silver.
---
He's not wrong. Vanilla leveling is incredibly tedious when it comes to downtime and your resources.
---
&gt;For many people cosmetic changes are the world.
---
Exactly. An example would be the Human Male special attack animation where you jump up in the air and forcefully bring your weapon down.
---
To some, changing this wouldnt matter. To me it would absolutely break the race.
---
I've also moved 5 times and now I'm back where I started, so I'm getting the closest I can to pure original.
---
So this is satire then. Good good
---
didn't say it was the best game ever lmao
---
I'm pretty much only subbed to here and /r/freefolk and I can no longer tell the difference. Its hilarious
---
two weeks is my entire vacation time for a year and some people have less
---
Don't bother. Classic is immune from criticism on this sub
---
I dont know why you prefer sitting here embarassing yourself when all you have to do is to go to youtube and type in "Vanilla rogue PvP" to check for yourself.
---
Yes, you can run any character to the starting zone of whatever race you want on your own faction to lvl. The true problem pops up when you need a class trainer not in the area.
---
LOL
---
Both were pretty popular, but IF was more crowded usually.
---
As a lowbie I tended to spend more time in SW, then that gradually changed to IF the closer to 60 I got.
---
They most likely will, but don't forget, the game has to come out of beta first before that's a smart decision. 
---
That's like asking why BfA beta and Legion didn't show as separate games.
---
Hey a thing that is actually a problem, proven with evidence. Not just a *feeling*. Great job!
---
It's different for private servers, Blizzard could never reset new servers. It'd be wildly unpopular with most of their playerbase. How many people would you say would be okay with something they paid money to spend a thousand hours on being deleted? To keep things being fresh with just vanilla content, they'd have to create new servers every time, which is another really bad idea.
---
New content is the only way forward after classic.
---
I think a lot of people in this sub really genuinely WANT retail to be good, it just isn't. So idk if the shots at retail are exactly "random", it's more frustration that it isn't, and then the happiness that we are getting a version of the game we know will be good.
---
It got a standalone mobile client and Valve is now working on a standalone client to take it out of Dota 2. Some of the new game hype has worn off but there are still a lot of people interested in it.
---
It's 14 years old mate. That's just the way it is.
---
no you're talking about old expansions which is factored in the cost of classic which would be unprofitable if hours hadn't been taken by a some people to restore systems (like omar). The sub generated makes money but nowhere near the levels you think it will.
---
You'd have to be retarded to think so.
---
I'd rather late summer. My work is extremely busy during hot weather so I'll be working crazy hours up til basically September. And most people aren't teachers.
---
When I'm questing as a lvl 35-40 in STV, I feel the biggest sense of accomplishment when I keep killing the same players and they hope on their mains. The ultimate reeeee.
---
Ey, we arw starting 1 week earlier. So guess i will have to complete a whole year in that time
---
If you are selected for the stress test/beta, there will be a new entry in the Region/Account drop down area of your battle net launcher.
---
just go the first day, ask when the final exams are, and then go play. just go when you have your finals and ezpz
---
I mean that's a pretty easy decision, focus on your real life priorities....
---
I'm not a sentimental person, in fact I'm pretty neutral about almost everything in my life.
---
But all this, the beta, the streamers talking for hours about their favourite game, the thousands of players excited to meet their long lost love again after so many years, that really warms my heart.
---
Thats not where I saw that post going. kudos for actually making me lol!
---
Am I the only one that never had a syllabus day in college lol?

Uhh no, a majority of the wealth is held by Goblins who can literally buy out anything they want and make the prices go insanely high. Infact they do this all the time. It’s just that stupid goblins go too far to the point that people would rather farm it. Also farming the mats to make the items is a loss of profit, WoWs economy atm is so shit that people basically pay you to make items for you. Since full items are less than mats.
---
I don't think there are many (any?) good end-game tanking axes, making orc a poorer choice for tank.
---
But for PvE it barely matters, honestly.
---
it’s on purpose to save space
---
It's like when someone reminds you that you don't think about each breath, then you have to start manually breathing.

Or when you realize that no matter what your tongue is never really resting and is always uncomfortable.

---
ill put a bug report in about in in the beta. I encourage everyone in beta to do the same.
---
Buy a smaller monitor = less heat produced. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It's a relatively small beta though. Consider just how many people have actually played since 2004-2006
---
25 hours the first day here
---
Ikr? Pathetic
---
Everyone asking this question should remember that it was version 1.0 of a game, not version 8.0.
---
So, yes, Classic is logically the best place to start playing WoW...never forget that we were all noobs at one point or another =)
---
I think one problem with retail is to make it great again they will have to undo so many things they've done and I don't know if they're really willing to do that.
---
You are autistic, can't handle deviations to what you think are the right ways.
---
Sodapoppin
---
They won't be able to tell what's being cast or for how long, blizzard said they would block non-vanilla addons, and this information was not available to your client in vanilla.
---
my thoughts exactly, ROOKIE NUMBERS. gotta pump them numbers up! I'll have 50 days of leave on release but I'll probably only take three weeks.
---
If you get invited to the beta, you get both beta and stress test.
---
You can receive a stress test invite only though.
---
As Rhynchelma said, above the Play button of World of Warcraft page in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) client, you will see a Region/Account drop down.  Beta and/or Stress test will be listed their under PTR if you received an invite to either or.
---
It's fun but only has certain metas that work. My first week of playing it was the most fun since i didnt exactly know what to go for.
---
Anyway, valve is creating a standalone auto chess game so most people are waiting for that to not waste time with progress that doesn't go over.
---
You're gonna have fun. Raiding was only one part of Vanilla. Just do what you can and enjoy the journey.
---
&gt; I said change the things we know were broke or change the things they can.
---
That's your problem, you think you can be surgical in a holistic, cohesive MMO. You *can't* do what you're suggesting.
---
Don't want to group, using your smartphone to post this... Well, I guess I would have ignored you aswell
---
I made sure to do it when I got in on the stress test. Thanks for the support!
---
I don't get the point of this method when it's an option in your battle.net. Am I missing something here? Or just meme value?
---

Wow who would've thought the correct way to tame beast was to cast tame beast.

"I was told that people would be SOCIAL in Classic! TEAM UP WITH ME NOW, SCUM!!!!!!!"
---
You should level in your race's territory for bonus rep which means cheaper mount.
---
Its stupid to do the cross-race starting areas.... unless its tauren to durotar because Mulgore sucks so fuking hard.
---
Will they lose some micros likely. Will they get new subs that I’ve already seen happen. I’m sure they did a balance to see how that works and we have to consider micros are only bought once for the pets mounts etc while subs are constant income.
---
Thanks so much for this post! it has really put some things in perspective for me and i like that it sounds reasonable and somewhat attainable, depending on how dedicated you become.
---
It’s a great experience if she wants to play alongside you, but if not, don’t let a video game ruin a relationship. WoW has destroyed many.
---
You're retarded if you think climbing the terrain to reach places you shouldn't be able to reach normally to escape enemies is not cheating.
---
When you say a table of useful information I guess I’m just curious what info that is about. You don’t have to be detailed.
---
Probably going to multiply the drama around here quite a bit.

Good luck being an ele shaman in AQ =D

---
Stonetalon Mountains is really the only one that comes close. Horde have way more zones to gank lowbies in than Alliance do. :(
---
I see what you mean. Yes, it's possible, but the crafting fee is still 10x as high as most other items. It's a supply/demand thing mostly.
---
I like your determination as myself I am rolling paladin to tank/dps with in pvp. However I have to agree with above poster. You can do bs if u want but please get engineering. Sapper charges and the reflect shield/bombs are very very both it for prot tanks. I would say necessary.
---
I can't post without a lvl 10 char on the beta from what I've seen... Perplexity told me they read this sub though, considering the impact this post has, we can hope they read it
---
It’s not cheating. Anyone can do this with a Speed potion and people have done this in Vanilla prior. 
---
You’re the retarded one. You suck dick at trolling.
---
&gt; Also you saying you’re that you’re too lazy to search up a bluepost while also saying “I proved you all wrong!” Doesn’t help.

Oh my god you people are such babies.

[Here, swallow it.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=254115.11/new-silence-penalty-coming-to-world-of-warcraft)
---
This is on a private server.
---
You took the shortcut I always run the long way the first time.
---
The error message isn't a lie.........
---
It's saying that there are no servers available *within the list your client is allowed to see*.
---
The bug on Friday where even stress testers could see all the realms, and the Alpha test server showed up for Beta testers? *That* was kind of a lie. :P
---
Then we have a new WoW based on the classic game. All we need to do is stick to what made Classic great....and by that I mean raise a holy hell shitstorm if the devs want to dumb it down for the casuals. They already have their game.
---
Yeah this game is coming out at a time in my life where it’ll make or break me
---
Because TBC is trash, and people will quit the game when Alliance stops being a faction.
---
&gt;Once again, adding some kinda mechanic like "your tank must jump on this platform and unequip his chest slot for 30 seconds" or whatever these "more mechanics" mean, does not make the raid harder.
---
Wtf, lol?
---
&gt;AQ40 was hard. Naxx was hard. Why? Because you actually had to be geared properly to clear them.
---
You think you dont need gear to mythic raid in wow now? xD
---
&gt;You had to manage 40 people. 
---
This was socially a challenge, and does not make the game itself more difficult. Yes 40 man raids are more difficult to organise than 20 mans.
---
Although, content was tuned to not actually need 40 amazing players while in 20 man mythic current content you DO need everyone to be good if you want to kill the boss in any reasonable ranking.
---
&gt;There is nothing "hard" about being teleported to an instance/group and beating Sargeras after a few hours of rolling your character. The fact that I have to explain that is ridiculous.
---
Idk wtf you are trying to say again. Teleporting exists in vanilla.
---
I also don't give a fuck about the lore, and don't see how the lore plays in to a discussion of how difficult a game is or isn't.
---
&gt;Again, whacking up the difficulty with mythic doesn't mean shit. If you cleared the content and saw the bosses die, then you cleared the content and saw the bosses die. It doesn't matter if you beat it on lower difficulty.
---
This is FULL ON sperging out.
---
Thats disappointing. im very exited for Classic, but anyone that believes Vanilla was perfect is insane.
---
At least we'll have a dose of our addiction on may 29th again. No idea how I'm going to survive after may 29th though.
---
Indeed. We need to solve for local maxima.
---
delete this post pls. ty.
---
they can kill people in the world quite well though, but in BG's they are flagcarries in WSG and basically useless in AB but gets carried because they are so good in WSG.
---
Trolling definitely was a think back in 2006 and trolls were just as shit as they were today. Hell, I remember trolling the fuck out of AOL chats back in 1999.
---
I think the 0.02% chance is probably too high already. There is more than one of the mobs that can drop the item so it shouldn't take 23k runs for a 99% chance.
---
The thing is, content in vanilla doesn't get obsolete in the same way as retail content does.
---
There are plenty of items from MC and BWL that are bis even up until Naxx. Yes, every single item from Naxx is better (except some trinkets, and some loot from C'thun), but you will still wear stuff from MC and BWL while progressing in Naxx.
---
For example, the bis wep for ferals is a blue from Gnomeregan, and the bis trinket (in the entire game) for fury warriors is from BWL, bis trinket for Warlocks is from Nefarian etc etc.
---
Even when most of your core members are geared to the teeth, the hardest raids are 40 man and you will *always* be recruiting new people. These people need to be geared, so you have to bring them to older raids.
---
Hydra, Moo, Tribe, Perplexity, Pshero, P4wnyhof. Just a few that come to mind.
---
All had over 1k viewers playing the beta this week.
---
You look good in high res
---
Imagine judging your masculinity by a WoW server.
---
Bruh.  Get off the welfare.  If you actually work hard and are not an idiot, you can make a lot of money in America.  Money is a non issue to me, because I work my ass off for it.
---
the speed doesn't affect the animation in vanilla.
---
So is it working as intended like in vanilla or not?
---
That comparison doesn’t make sense. It’d be like if your character was glitched and T-posing all the time and your reason for not fixing it was “oh, you can believe in dragons and demons but not someone fighting and sliding on the ground in a stiff T-pose at all times?”
---
I’m not saying they should fix it. If this is how it was in vanilla then by all means, keep it. But it was clearly changed because it was an animation that didn’t match the physics of the world they had created.
---
\*checks link number\*
---
Cross post from the official forums perchance?
---
Can you recommend some WoW documentaries? Or any kind of WoW content that will hype me up?
---
Pretty sure it only shows as “beta and stress test: wow classic”. The closed beta show as separate servers.
---
If they are smart, they will limit the amount of layers a single server can have. After that limit is reached they can just lock the server forcing people to move on to other servers. The only servers I think it may be a problem on are servers that streamers go on. Asmongold and Soda regularly have over 50k viewers... each! Streamers really wont be able to play with each other which kinda sucks for them
---
Show up for roll call and act all sic:
---
- Snort some pepper to sneeze.
---
- Cough alot. 
---
- Ask random people for asiprin. 
---
Then when you call in sick the next day hold one nostril to sound like you have a cold. 
---
Ez 3-4 days of unquestioned absence.
---
yes
---
Um, I have Reddit on my phone?
---
That’s remainder to be seen, but good drama can always pay dividends.
---
Eh, I'll just roll with my private server guild. Most of them know what to do and I know what to expect from them.
---
Hope they can fix this even if it’s after launch.
---
When I first played and I was 10 my brother took my level 10 nelf Hunter all the way to dun morogh to get me a white cat and ran back to where I had been questing before for me

Just stick with BFA if you don't understand - heard 8.2 gon be a doozy
---
That's maybe 5% of quests cause they're tied to a location, not a quest giver
---
I don't care if you do 4x more damage or just auto attack, if you exclude people based on their class and/or spec choice, you won't be in my group. I'm playing Classic because I finally get to go back to the world that gripped me more than any other game. You wanna run tank pally? I'll find a healer willing to  heal you.

you  do realise that the build on beta is basically based off from retail  wow engine...? 1.12 had exact same animations as every private server  I've played on (and I've pplayed on every big one)
---
The speed doesn't affect the animation, you just basically move faster, that's how it should work 100% blizzlike.
---
Please don't write shit here when you don't know anything about the original animation, ty.
---
If you tag a mob first you do get the kill
---
That's not anything out of order, Void tends to have aggro problems at specific points during leveling, you can get used to it and adjust your playstyle. It's biggest problem is running out of mana, not even dropping aggro tbf.

damn people in beta have access to naxx already?
---
Aww you guys member WarCraft Movies? I member...
---
Yeah saw it there, figured I'd put more eyes on it.
---
I mean, I get having maps or tables beside your keyboard to glance at would be handy. 
---
This time around though in classic, I'd have to take a guess at over 50% of people having a second monitor that will be dedicated to wowhead or other resources.
---
So both are druids?
---
Do you need an active subscription to find out if you are eligible for the stress test?
---
That's fine, I'm sure you'll enjoy how you play. Others will too. I'm merely pointing out why it's not a good idea for any sort of group content if you want groups. You're far less likely to be picked.
---
dude go back to retail and stay there please.
---
Hooray for no ads thru reddit mobile
---
Then I suppose I'm in the post-Naxx crowd.  There were lots of areas in azeroth that were unfinished.  I remember all the wild speculation, and then nothing happened with it.  There's lots of potential to have an alternate timeline.
---
How is he being a hypocrite when he said the guy will play it AND hate on it in trade/general chat? Dumbass
---
And the new animation looks like a walking animation that was sped up..? Neither of them look perfect, but the 'gliding' was how it looked in vanilla, that takes priority over whatever anybody prefers
---
Haha I love that we get temporary 30 meta. I remember seeing videos of hunters solo farming bosses in LBRS and DireMaul in the classic days. Mages can kite bosses to death pretty reliably as well, right?
---
I would be so happy if they fit Worldbreaker Hulk into the MCU.
---
I mean he's completely OP, but man is it an awesome story.
---
Oh my... I hope they change this back to what it was. That current flight path one is so bad, its like its a robot just following orders.
---
And then a priest mind controlled you off
---
There are two parts to the AQ event, the War Efforts and the Scepter Questline. Both are available the day the patch hits.
---
The War Efforts require BOTH factions to turn in:
---
* 90,000 Copper Bar
---
* 26,000 Purple Lotus
---
* 80,000 Thick Leather
---
* 17,000 Spotted Yellowtail
---
* 400,000 Runecloth Bandage
---
The Alliance must also turn in:
---
* 28,000 Iron Bar
---
* 24,000 Thorium Bar
---
* 20,000 Arthas' Tears
---
* 33,000 Stranglekelp
---
* 180,000 Light Leather
---
* 110,000 Medium Leather
---
* 20,000 Roast Raptor
---
* 14,000 Rainbow Fin Albacore
---
* 800,000 Linen Bandage
---
* 600,000 Silk Bandage
---
The Horde must also turn in:
---
* 22,000 Tin Bar
---
* 18,000 Mithril Bar
---
* 96,000 Peacebloom
---
* 19,000 Firebloom
---
* 60,000 Heavy Leather
---
* 60,000 Rugged Leather
---
* 10,000 Lean Wolf Steak
---
* 10,000 Baked Salmoon
---
* 250,000 Wool Bandage
---
* 250,000 Mageweave Bandage
---
During this time, any level 60 player can start the Scepter Questline that I described above. It very much requires a geared guild to complete all the steps. The problem is, one of the steps in the questline is clearing BWL in under 5 hours and looting the shard from Nefarian. He only drops ONE shard, so now your guild must decide who is getting the scepter because it's unlikely you'll get another BWL clear before some other guild rings the gong.
---
Once the Horde and the Alliance turn in ALL of the items, a 5 day timer starts. After that 5 day timer, anyone with a completed scepter can ring the gong and get the mount. Anyone ELSE with a completed scepter has 10 hours to also ring the gong or they won't get the mount.
---
The fastest realm had all the items turned in in 14 days.
---
The fastest guild had the entire scepter questline done in 7 days but they were still unable to complete a second one before the gong was ready to be smashed because of the weekly reset.
---
doesn't effect gameplay at all, it's low priority.
---
I did make one based on 3.3.5. But I think timing is off. Will upload later. I'm unsure if the path is different between 1.12.1 and 3.35 or, they changed the smoothing (older is for sure catmullrom).. Because there's a curve that happens on the final into ironforge that is more pronounced on 3.3.5 compared to beta. And overall the speed is slightly off. 
---
That's aside from the tilt. Tilt is entirely a code change. The data for paths is in the dbc /db2 files and just contains a list of xyz coordinate sets. So, that's code side.
---
I mean at least people have good points about retail. "Ran out of mana on a lvl 1 = mediocre" is quite a reach.
---
I mean I don’t really care about for people getting in the base this was but this was a thing and vanilla and will be a thing now more than likely.
---
Nice entitlement you got there champ
---
Clever usage of game mechanics u muppet
---
First of all he doesn't know he will paly and complain on the trade chat. Secondly, this sub hates on retail 24/7, but gets all up in arms when someone says they don't like classic
---
I feel like in the context of the situation by nobody he meant gaming companies
---
Depends on her stances on those particular things. Chances are she wouldn't have married you if she didn't support those things in the first place... Presuming you have had those hobbies since then.
---
Or maybe she is an alcoholic opioid loving hooker herself.
---
Yes you can, The world of warcraft forums have a classic section, all you need is a retail character to post there.
---
You suck at wow
---
I loved going to splintertree post in Ashenvale.
---
I hate when people use that argument. It's the small things that break peoples immersions, not the large ones. You know how people look when they walk vs. when they run so having this jank sliding will throw you off. Do you know what it's like for a giant firegod to rise out of the ground?
---
But it is. Unless they are 60 and have almost every BiS gear, they are pretty useless.
---
This is my experience as well. I play on the private server in question and on beta and it's always been first to tag unless you die or it gets reset. Not sure what the op means.
---
You're 100% correct, but if you haven't noticed, people sum everything up to trolling now, and the content of jokes and ruses back then were far superior, mainly for the fact they were not recycled.
---
Yeah, that's what a beta test is for. To find issues like these, and fix them.
---
With how much money I’ve put in to this game, fuck yeah I’m entitled to something.
---
I don't know if it's a problem, but Warlock has generally more binds and micromanagement compared to mage. Pet alone can be 6-8 different keybinds, for example.
---
Yup! Closer to MC/BWL.
---
Its going to be a long summer.  (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
---
1. Layering 
---
2. The first person TO DO DAMAGE of any kind gets the tag. (example: DoTs are not going to be your best bet to tag something quickly because they all take about 2-3 seconds before they tick any damage.
---
This is a good analogy. This game followed wc3 and it shows in its careful design, just like heroes in wc3 are weaker than 2 creeps but can take on an army at max lvl. You can see care and thought was put behind classic wow and the journey.
---
Its wack a mole with all the flashy light up buttons
---
&gt;	they’re game
---
That is a good point about guilds hoarding stuff. But this is the point of testing this stuff.
---
I'm sure Blizz is well aware of the current backlash.
---
Yeah sorry bro i have a life to live :) 9 months work equals 12 months free. Beat that.
---
Can't you 3 shot those wolves tho?? Why must people lie and be bad
---
I didnt know i could go from Wetlands to IF and take the train to SW, so i ran or somehow got to Ratchet took the boat to Stranglethorn from there i ran and died a lot, all the way to Westfall.
---
Work?
---
All casuals goes to classic and now blizzard can start fixing retail. Remove titanforge, remove WQs/Emmisaries, make flying avaliable again and remove LFR. Now everyone will start enjoying retail while the casuals won't complain about not getting gear etc from emmisaires. GG
---
Oh makes sense. That'd be the right thing to do anyways.
---
I guess you have a point. Something just switched off in my brain come BFA that I just stopped playing. I was looking forward to it, the idea of an all out faction war but I got to level 112 and gave up. First expansion it's happened to me.
---
well, cuz this post was about daggers..
---
Just mean I'll group with far less unfun people than. I see this as a win.
---
Best thing is either having a fellow gamer for a girlfriend or just not having one and not dealing with all that. TBH a non gamer will never understand you and it's always going to be a point of contention. Sucks man hit me up for beers in xx years when she's sick of your shit and telling some judge you stole xx years of her life in divorce court. Much luck best wishes etc.
---
Here's a timestamped example: [https://youtu.be/OuPLWf24OME?t=352](https://youtu.be/OuPLWf24OME?t=352)
---
Can even do it without using any speed increase.
---
And a good 50% will leave after a month when they realize how slow it is.
---
You could probably do it in 4.5~5 days played if you go full neet
---
Natur Enemy Cast Bar could absolutely tell you what spell was being cast and how long the cast time was. The only thing it couldn't differentiate between was different ranks of spells.
---
I see your point but a lot of people spent a lot of time at launch and from my own anecdotal memory I know  plenty moved on at TBC. I remember a lot of rage posts over the upcoming changes
---
So for some reason, in WoD they changed how you level professions. Let's say you take mining, then you just mine ores you find in WoD content (now Legion and BfA content) and you get ores, already at level 1, just less than if you were maxed out. Similar stuff is done for every single content, like alchemists could make potions from level 1 just not flasks or something like that - so it was still worth to get up your profession, but it could be done entirely with WoD content. This erased Classic and 4 expansions worth of content for when you level professions.
---
I only see clips of him on here but asmongold just gets under my skin...i hate the way he acts baffled when things don’t go his way.  
---
Esfand strikes me as a lot more likable and i enjoy his clips more.
---
50% of #1 biggest game is #2 and thats still pretty big
---
It spawns at every 3 hour interval.  So yes, it will be available at launch.  Getting there at level 1-2 will be tricky, but can be done.
---
Went there after you said that, it appears now my character is accounted for so I can, but I cannot post links... Had to butcher the link to make it visible there...
---
Y'all just want *World of Warcraft: My Way*, don't you?
---
&gt; They can virtually correct all their mistakes if they wanted to take Classic that way (including expansions). 
---
Good luuuuuck classifying stuff as a mistake. Even the recent GCD changes have benefits (hello one-button CDs macros).
---
Another 50% of the remaining when they realize how bad many of the specs are.
---
Nah, all the world event mission crap, dungeon quests, most of the qlines etc. It is pretty rare that you actually have to interact with npc anymore. Most of the time you don't.
---
Man I hear some people say this but maybe it just depends on the degree and the job you get. I did a computer science degree and let me tell you when I played as much wow (p servers) in college as I can now I failed my classes. I have way more time to play now and clear boundaries.
---
Depends if you want to keep tailoring constantly levelling while you level which is going to be a task. Or if you're willing to stay killing lower level mobs instead of levelling for cloth or carrying on levelling and going back to do your tailoring later.
---
It will be available at launch, but trust me there will be several people on both factions trying to be the first. On day 1 of closed beta, between 3-5 people went. I imagine it'll be multiple times that amount on actual launch.
---
Lmao. I was able to play on the stress servers this past week and level a too. To 5. I had a blast, traveled from the gnome starting area to Elwynn forest to hunt murlocs near Goldshire 😊😊😊 I logged into regular WoW last night and it felt so bland and watered down compared to Classic I logged out after an hour lol
---
Isn't there no DR on fear and we get two? One of which is aoe?
---
Takes around 8 minutes from the horde/troll starting zone (tested it). So not very tricky but absolutely worth it.
---
lol what's the point getting this shit at lvl 1. you won't gonna get it 12 times in a row. And even if you do it was definitely not worth the time.
---
You severely underestimate how much money Blizzard makes of micro-transactions.
---
I still don't think there's sufficient evidence to suggest it's on the loot tables for any mob except raid bosses and the two raid bosses that will have it in Phase 1 are Ony and Rag.
---
Yea so were moonkins. Then they were fixed.
---
gj =)
---
BFA launch had 600k + viewers.
---
I'll consider it, however I did Engineering for 10 years already, and I was looking to try something new and see what different cool and epic gear I could make. I'm not really worried about getting a world first molten core clear, or even being a main tank. I was just wondering if anyone knew which tree in blacksmithing was the most fun, or had the most useful gear for a Paladin.
---
There are at least a few instances where this happens, a major one that comes to mind is if you take the Tram from SW to IF and have those Flighpaths.  You would be level 10 flying over Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge, Loch Modan etc.  Flight paths also used to meander more.  At some point they were streamlined to go from Point A to B more as the crow flies.
---
Yep you can skip this day. Dont worry. Trust me I'm a professional
---
But it would be breaking it, not fixing it. It's obvious the animation was broken before. One thing Blizzard is known for is great animation and "skating" was one of the big reasons I couldn't play any other MMOs.
---
Do you not gain more honor if you're killing other people in WSG? I thought you'd get next to nothing doing this
---
Got a standard adult life. I do however got money saved up to spent a month on my biggest hobby. We did get a few years notice, remember? ;)
---
I warn you if you play wow classic first all other MMOs shall disappoint you
---
I got in this monday and still haven't got a email about it. Without reddit I doubt I would have checked before the stress-test.
---
One of the best docus out there about Blizz and WoW.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyPzTywUBsQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyPzTywUBsQ)
---
Itemization.info has all the changes for almost every item based on patches.
---
It's pretty close to vanilla (not sure If 100%)
---
Ya, give blizzard money for nothing. It's pretty sad how many players are handing over money to blizzard just to get an ass fucking.
---
...but but Quin said Ret Paladin sucks at PvP.
---
Already scheduled my 4 weeks from august 27 dude, gonna be nuts
---
rip
---
I think an 8 minute run for roughly 2gold is totally worth it on level 1.
---
Maybe. I think there will be an initial falloff of active players after a month or two when those get their nostalgia or curiosity fix over with. But there will still be a lot of people playing Classic and trying to progress through content.
---
afaik you can start off with several gold, and it's a pretty nice boost. have a trinket locked up for later levels if you wanted to keep it. maybe a good boe to sell down the line.
---
Nobody gets their main faster than somebody being camped by a lower level. Used to camp stv on my 29 twinks.
---
It will be a huge burst of people because of the hype then fade down like normal, in which the true players will be able to roam free in their open lands, without flying and with world pvp around most corners.
---
GL with that :D [https://youtu.be/gSHNmz5TPHA?t=46](https://youtu.be/gSHNmz5TPHA?t=46)
---
I plan to take two weeks but maybe around October once the initial rush has stopped
---
You want all the other running animations to skate too as the correct animations are "shitty"?
---
2-3 corruption are among the 16 slots
---
&gt;This is FULL ON sperging out.
---
LMAO why do you guys keep calling other people incels/spergs. Is this some kinda "reclaiming words to empower ourselves" thing? You need to get back to Overwatch bro some e-girls need defending.
---
Yes, most warlocks just end up spamming Shadowbolt, a few will cast certain Curses on the Boss, but that’s about it.
---
I remember moving my main to the zone I was about to go level in, just in case. Big brain
---
You start off with fireball in vanilla, not frostbolt.
---
Don't be afraid of the WoD beginning.
---
The "allseer" lost track of a dragon, i doubt he's as infallible as he claims to be.
---
If you’re spec’d holy/protection, you bet. Paladins have massive raid utility in the form of buffs, healing and cleansing. If you’re fine with that, it’s welcome to raids.
---
I wonder why so few people want to play Druid when it is one of the most unique classes.
---
But you don't actually have any fucking idea what you're talking about, do you?
---
Pallies are one of the best raiders in the game. Their buffs are amazing and you would have to really try to go oom as a healer. You'll be coveted, not be pushed aside. 
---
This is as holy of course. There might be one ret for a 40 man raid. Prot can tank 5 mans just fine but can't really raid.
---
Do you need an active sub to the retail version in order to see the button? I’m not seeing this drop down.
---
You're just someone who thinks he knows what he's talking about. There were literally discussion threads made by blizzard for the topic of discussing changes. So stop already.
---
 Hey everyone!I am back finally with my second classic guide. I learned a lot from my first video and made a few improvements. I am looking forward to taking all that I learned from this Warrior Guide into my next one. I hope you all enjoy &lt;3 [https://youtu.be/XW2g3Xcucqg](https://youtu.be/XW2g3Xcucqg)
---
I was watching that this morning and thinking of posting it here. I’ve seen it before, but more relevant now than ever
---
I've never seen someone spell Paladin that many different ways in one thought before.
---
You'll be fine as long as your expectations meet reality. You WILL be healing. Not tanking, not DPSing, just healing (and buffing). And you'll be wearing cloth for almost all of your career.
---
It's literally broken animation. It's not good. Blizzard is known for their good animations instead of some B grade shitty MMO with "skating" running.
---
I don't know what run pay is exactly but i suggest you should use another payment method if it involves of running.
---
Mistakes are subjective. Nobody has ever done what blizzard did with World of Warcraft on the scale they did it and for how long they have done it. As the saying goes, they were never going to please everybody.
---
And as the other saying goes, they know they cannot control how quickly players consume content, how often players play, and players not recognizing that moderation or their own burnout effects what they think about the game.
---
Pro mark of the wild resist tho.
---
&gt; Classic is going to test me.
---
you could even say, it will test your might
---
It sounds like this isn't the first time someone has said something like this to you.
---
Have you considered there may be a reason for it?
---
To clarify though, I didn't call you an "incel" or a "sperg" I said that quoted section of text was sperging out. 
---
Regardless, you seem like a delicate little snowflake and I assume you're telling your tumblr about how mean the people on classicwow are to you, I hope they give you all the support you need, petal.
---
To be fair running out of mana sucks and knowing that you'll run out even if you play well had a particular feeling attached to it. Either you enjoy the artificially extended combat or you don't.
---
&gt; It'll be the biggest phenomenon since the first release of Classic. 
---
Both TBC and WotLK launches were bigger than Vanilla.
---
Sounds real good tbh
---
Considering they've already stated the pvp honor system won't be in place until BGs come out and the ranking system won't be put in until Phase 2 I don't this being a problem for awhile.
---
Wtf, there isn't anything significant that requires ranged DPS by melee classes
---
I work for a gaming company.
---
I have not played the beta so I cannot say with certainty but I know 100% they used to so they should get larger
---
If you plan on being level 10 to 30 for long u a full on scrub
---
R.I.P. academic career.
---
this is so good every time I watch it
---
Yeah, TBC is trash. That's why burning Crusade subscriptions were higher than classic subscriptions back in the day, and so-called fresh private server burning Crusade servers Drew droves of people as well.
---
The people who I feel sorry for are people who loathe Warlords of Draenor Legion or battle for Azeroth, and the moment we move into burning Crusade they can't help but think, oh here we go the fun times are over and things are changing and the fact that I know the content Road I am on things I'm going to enjoy burning Crusade far less than I enjoyed it 12 years ago.
---
People will go into burning Crusade already thinking about battle for Azeroth 12 years down the road and they will sabotage their own experience.
---
Okay man, 10 hours for level 10 is a bit far fetched. I'd say that normal time is about 2h+, if you are really taking your time maybe 3-4.
---
Hi, /u/bdao321
---
You get rewarded by joining a 5 man dungeon, have 3 out of 5 ppl expecting a summon... explaining you can't summon with 2 ppl you need 3. Have the run take longer then a grp with no warlock (go figure) and end up leaving grp is frustration of lazy gamers. All classic warlocks will experience this if they play long enough.
---
If these force spawns are coded in a way that isn't active in 7.3.5, that code wouldn't carry over to the classic beta due to it just using the database but not all of the old code. It's also extremely hard to notice something like this if you're testing 1.12 client with just a few players. It's entirely possible that this system should be in but hasn't been noticed by Blizzard on the reference client.
---
Shes going for world first come launch time! Will definitely be a good watch
---
Can someone give a run down of what just happened?
---
This was pre patch 1.12 so things like speed will be normalised sorry
---
People who aren't in STEM wouldn't understand. Going to work feels almost like a walk in the park compared to the shitshow engineering school was.
---
As a casual myself here is how I imagine my play time going down just about every day, and I must say I'm excited. 
---
I'm going to roll a Hunter, and farm everything. Farm mobs, farm mats, farm wpvp, farm farm farm. I Just want to stay out in the world, and explore every nook and cranny. I don't hear this talked about a lot but World Drops were amazing in vanilla. When you got one you either got rich quick, or just got a major boost in power. I will be farming for those. Everything sells on the auction house. Every white item has a purpose. If it's white, throw it on the AH.  I will run the occasional dungeon, and I do want to farm my dungeon set and dabble in some raiding, but mostly I just want to get out and kill stuff. 
---
Farming in old school wow up through wrath was so zen. You didn't have to press 90 buttons super fast, you just flowed, and had a small rotation, and you found a rhythm going from mob to mob even with classes that have downtimes. For a casual, classic is the best.  It's all about the journey. It'll take a first timer at least 10-15days played time to reach 60. That's a long time. Don't sweat it, don't let it deter you. I usually stretch that out because there are level brackets where certain classes become more OP than others, and some zones you come to that have more wpvp, or certain items that drop that you want to spend a lot of time in and just soak up the experience.  
---
That is what classic is about. Not gear, not levels.. the experience.  If you set your goal as "having an experience" every time you log on you will be able to achieve more than you ever thought possible in a video game, and you'll realize why classic has such a huge spot in all of our hearts.  
---
Good luck to you! Hope to see you in game!
---
Lol I have it narrowed to 3. Mage, rogue, or priest. I played none of them at launch.
---
I noticed one of the Wyverns at the crossroads during the stress test. I remember them always laying down appearing to be asleep. One sat up on the pole and shook its head, it yawned and then layed back down. I never saw one do that before... it's not the same issue, but was one of the many details that was new to me. I'm sure they will have pathing looking good before release.
---
Bosses are immune to slow and mages dont have speed increases so it wont be very easy nor reliable.
---
They mostly have to abuse pathing and if possible blink on cooldown to stay ahead.... depending on the boss.
---
Hunters can just outrun almost everything.
---
Yeah there’s no rules against pvping while multiboxing on retail. You can gank people all day long if you want. That’s a private server rule.
---
Bullshit. He said it would be there for the entire first part of the game or it will be removed by BWL. He did say they might remove it earlier but he never said only a few weeks.
---
&gt; None of the things said in the video made any sense. They arbitrarily said things using skill names and none of it was accurate. 
---
You just summed up the average vanilla WoW player.  That's why the vid, originally, was painfully believable.
---
You never quit WoW, you just take vacations.
---
hmm, sorry about that. I'll check it out.
---
There are goals to work forward towards in every single Warcraft expansion. The difference being that in earlier expansions those goals are often narrower and require more teamwork.
---
Stealth healers as point defenders can be pretty nice un AB or AV
---
There is no way BfA had 600k concurrent views. Where are you getting your info?
---
It's already going to ruin the game. Honestly it might be better to just wait a month or two until private servers come out without layering.
---
Here's some [evidence](https://web.archive.org/web/20060328110547/http://www.thottbot.com/?i=27818). Not all thottbot comments made it to WoWhead it seems.
---
The internet is so much safer than it used to be.
---
Wow, what an idiot.
---
There was this one dude on my server before Naxx dropped who played Resto shaman all through, got a full ele set and then pvpd as ele. He fucked shit up too. Can't remember a name but the guild was RAGE.
---
That's very misleading as Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm are the largest sources of microtransactions. I doubt WoW microtransactions are a larger source of revenue than WoW subscriptions.
---
A very small amount of this depends on your relationship with other guild members and what their Guild regulations are. If you want to raid with a paladin and you want to do it your way then you have to find the guild that caters to that.
---
A Bobby B bot Ned! On an open sub!
---
"imagine" 
---
stop
---
I really do miss it as well. I hate having to doublethink about what I want to say because it might be misinterpreted. Words are just words, and if you're on the internet you can just put an intolerably offensive person on your ignore list or log off.
---
Uh, that really just looks like they where outside of what he could see on his screen, and then he saw them when he turned around. I cant see any phasing, and even if they just popped up it would be something strange with the viewdistance, not phasing.
---
If you are looking to tank or provide damage in raids as a paladin, then Vanilla era WoW is not the place for you.
---
Your job is to buff the 39 other individuals for the next 2 hours and make sure noone dies.
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
---
Differwnce being there are no wolves to my knowledge in any of the horde starting zones so he must have been further levels. I actually think this may be a troll because of it.
---
I feel like the majority of people aren't actually going to be warrior mains, but that's just me.
---
I actually was on Twitch before BFA release and yes, it had over 600k viewers when they launched it.
---
?
---
What do you mean?
---
First week doesn’t matter.
---
RIGHT? It's the worst game ever. I actually have to sit down and DRINK for mana, can you feckin' believe that? What kind of World do we live in where Xxlordbigdick has to do such mundane things?
---
You need a reality check Blizz, there's no way people will play a game like that.
---
ur retarded they make ur money whichever one u play.

Professors at my college drop any student who doesn't attend the first day of class. Be careful Yo
---
Aawwwww! Give him a hug right now!
---
This one is from Blizzcon 2005, short presentation on raid design: 
---
https://youtu.be/Falm0H7VEiQ
---
Nobody uses them but they are still there.
---
I love wow... but I seriously don't understand people who are taking a week to a month off to play. You gonna burn yourself out...
---
What time the 26th?

# #nochanges
---
Hi, /u/iqsixsixsix
---
Realm forums are pointless when Reddit exists and will make their own realm subreddits if there is a demand for it. And twitch chat is gaming culture now, so Barrens chat will be filled with Kappas and 4Heads.
---
We made our bed, now we have to lay in it.
---
We could always try to push a realm subreddit, to help keep the feeling of the old game
---
Damn dog you hella dense. Do you frequent 4chan often?
---
Paladins fulfill a healing role in Vanilla, so you'd better enjoy healing.
---
I feel like you just stole that from that song
---
Raids:
---
Release: Molten core(40man) and Onyxia(40man) 
---
Phase3: Blackwinglair(40man)
---
Phase4: Zul'gurub(20man with 3day reset)
---
Phase 5: AQ40(40man duh), AQ20(20man duh, 3 day reset)
---
Phase 6: Naxx(40man)
---
Lots of raiding to be done my man
---
Pretty sure there were flight path changes during vanilla.  But I cant say exactly what 1.12 looks like.  I know they added points, sped up certain paths, etc.  but yah like lots of ppl been saying, it was hella slow and laggy.
---
Its not 100% no. But ttue or not, the fact is that thats how blizzard wants it to work and thats what they said, not me, thats why stats on rings got changed in legion, because they want you to look at the ilvl and instantly know if its better or not because they didnt want people to feel forced to sim (people still do). Ofc doesnt apply to trinkets for instance
---
I &lt;3 you too lol.
---
Everyone watching these streams realizes how slow it is lol.
---
Honestly watching most of these streamers makes my head hurt.
---
Depends what region you’re in, it releases for me at 6pm EST.
---
You're a rogue god lol.
---
Yes, what I'd like to know are what are the raids available at that state, the name, if there is multiple or just one.
---
I believe killing wolves is one of the first quests for undead.
---
Im 99% sure the quest takes 10 gold for the lvl 40 version.
---
Ya but before that they are totally insulated. Red ridge is like lvl 18. Horde at 1k maybe 25-27? Hillsbrad 23 avg.
---
Nah, there are always a ton of warriors... just none of them want to tank!
---
Added the further proofs linked videos on this post to the video description. Also changed the title.
---
The speed at which they play absolutely can be. Same reason why some models were a different sizes on private servers because they were using the original model without multipliers.
---
If they weren't so beat up, they would be cool as collector's items, but with the internet databases they are not only useless but outright inferior with outdated information.
---
I doubt very much that ever happened lol
---
If I see my mana bar move I'm calling Activision.
---
Boat is cheaper ;)
---
&gt;It's not a fallacy.
---
It is. Just because you added a guild bank, that doesn't mean that LFR becomes more likely.
---
I'm distrustful of Blizzard as well, but identifying when you're being illogical is important.
---
Pretty easy take the ship to menethil and swim towards Westfall it doesn’t take long in fact you don’t even need to reach WF you can die mid way and spawn in IF if you know what you are doing and take the tram.
---
Obviously something as inane as a tilting gryphon will be sorted for the release; as it has been for every single iteration of WoW since the classic release this release beta is entirely based on. Jesus!
---
I didn't play much EQ before WoW, but played WoW with an EQ raiding guild. What they could already do before anyone figured out was mind blowing to me at the time. 40 man raid leadership and everyone knew how to play a role, before most people thought to bring a healer to dungeons.
---
The only patterns are farmable for the flasks. They are in UBRS and Scholo and BOE. You make a lot of money crafting flasks as they can only be made in side Scholo half way thru the instance.
---
they're waaaay better than this toxic sub :\^)
---
Iirc correctly that flight path should take about something close under 15 minutes and honestly I would prefer flying that then hopping on two boats but yeah if you are really short on time it's an interesting thought if it's faster
---
OP, do you go to Iowa State University?
---
I disagree, BfA rotations are braindead easy. Maybe you just played a simple class in vanilla?
---
&gt;so that alone makes it easier to get into raiding
---
Raiding and PvE in general is the worst possible way to measure how casual or noob friendly something is, it's the PvP that is the real measure of this. Classes in vanilla are definitely way more complex in a PvP scenario. Yeah raids are more complex in BfA, big deal, that's like 1% of the content while everything else is braindead easy and PvP was designed for lobotomy patients.
---
Teacher here. The release date is my literal worst case scenario.
---
Yeah no kidding huh. I looked down upon on non-STEM majors so much when I was in school. I admit my fault and I felt that way due to my own arrogance, however those majors really are a lot easier.
---
What exactly are they "already ruining" with classic?
---
No, but I've played rogue through vanilla to cata, then tried every expansion for couple weeks after that.
---
So I know exactly when this got broken, unlike you.
---
Thanks for teaching me how to build a car and run my own business!
---
Actually enjoyed leveling in BFA and the zones. Dungeons were cool. There was a lot of bad though. I played for hours everyday for like 2 months and quit Haha.
---
Aww I miss my epeen.  Can’t wait to start growing a new one with classic.
---
No, I mean everything they say is literal nonsense.  Actual babble that had no meaning ever in the context of WoW.  Plenty of tryhards would spout regurgitated info like they knew what they were talking about but this is not even regurgitated info. It's pure fabrication on the same level as the south Park world of Warcraft episode.  Anyone who played would have recognized it as such unless they literally had no idea what they were doing on the most basic level.
---
Slower weapons still have higher base damage. Normalization is for attack power, but the flat damage still matters for abilities.
---
Garr: No melee allowed when you're tagged as the bomb.
---
Baron Geddon: Melee will die from Inferno.
---
Shazzrah: Melee will die from Arcane Explosion.
---
Golemagg: Melee need to leave around 10%.
---
Majordomo: Melee classes need to use ranged during Purple Shield.
---
Ragnaros: Melee should not move in until the tank has sufficient aggro.
---
And that's just MC.
---
There were PLENTY of fights where a good melee DPS used their ranged weapon when they couldn't be in melee range.
---
Well, given that they have lion rears, I’d hope they look for somewhere to bury it like most cats
---
Hi, /u/Rooneeyk
---
Back off my priest raid slots.
---
Awesome thanks! 
---
If you don't mind me asking what do you usually do in-game? Do you just farm PvE or do other things
---
This isn’t actually satire.
---
Trolling has been a thing since the creation of the internet and definitely wasn’t uncommon back in 2006.
---
We still have satire these days.
---
??????
---
Of course it will fail. That’s why I’m waiting for real, good, guilds to be established before joining one for raiding.
---
I thought it was all undead and the wolves dont appear until you enter the rest of tirisfall glades. Im probably wrong its been a while since ive played undead.
---
So what professions should I take? not BS/mining then?
---
Same here. It’s a damn shame so much of the semester will be skipped.
---
He had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Oh wow you're the uploader. Thanks for posting the informative video. Lets get this fixed brother.
---
Everything is rolled into trolling now, any sort of joke or prank or anything that's funny, people seem to roll it into trolling, nobody said there's not satire these days, don't read too much into it, please.
---
Broken? lol it's an animation not a game mechanic. git gud
---
A lot of things are more fun than that though
---
Honestly the safest thing to do right now is release the game exactly as it was. Let people enjoy it. At some point maybe Blizzard will consider it a new branch of WoW and start improving it
---
I think the reason people are afraid of any changes is because for every change that would benefit an individual player there exist an infinite number of changes that would make the game worse.
---
People are afraid that one change makes way for a bunch of others.
---
Give it time.
---
They stated they are leaving the button in because in vanilla you could just log out to cause that to happen and the button just saves a relog screen
---
When they're pulling twice the numbers of the biggest twitch streamer in human history then I'll give a shit.
---
Old undead &gt; Current undead.
---
I guess that makes choosing a pet a little bit easier. Ty
---
Well I have to get money somehow to pay the china guys so they give me the gold for my epic mount later on :)
---
I was a main resto druid in classic and I never had any problems in bgs. We excel as flag carriers but that doesnt mean we are bad in AB and AV. The heals are good, but the real benefit of being a druid is the versatility. Mobility, CC, the option to assist damage as cat or balance depending on your talent spread.
---
I was feral/resto because back then both bear and cat talents were in the same tree, it was awesome.
---
Oh and take engineering.
---
Pretty much yes. I was a druid and Hunter in vanilla. Shaman and paladin were the God tier healers. In raid and BGs. But druids are significantly better flag carriers, especially when they get the benefit of the pop set bonuses
---
I don't think i could have ever pointed this detail out myself, but seeing the clip i clearly remember it and it would be a shame if it wasn't in the game!
---
I played on a potato during the early days so my view from the flight path was mostly fog lol
---
That doesn't mean Blizzard isn't constantly looking at more ways to make all of their games more open to their largest stream of revenue.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure wolves are one of the first quests, if not the first quest.
---
Horde this time around because it now has the label of the 'Hardcore' faction, and people are all about pretending to be hardcore. Polls seem to favor this.
---
its probably faster too if you get killed in alterac
---
You're not wrong at all. At least you're sensible enough to understand. My only point here is that something said by someone who worked at Blizzard a decade ago isn't an official confirmation of anything, to say so is misleading. I'm being brigade downvoted for simply pointing that out. It's entirely possible that this system IS in the reference version, but until a blue post comes out to say one way or another, saying it's "confirmed" is simply, factually wrong.
---
Who says we hate them? The op literally made the title say “this made me sad”. Can the op not express his emotions and opinion of others opinions? Plus. The first 10-30 minutes of any game usually isn’t the best...
---
Mage, it’s my favorite class
---
Haa how dare they not target the ravers?!
---
why not use the hearthstone
---
hell ye ;)
---
You’re just now catching on to this, eh?
---
You mean if you spec holy cause the only thing paladins did in classic was heal.
---
Appreciate it dude!
---
Well, I started literally days before BC release. On an rppvp realm. With a raiding group (not guild) I raided gruul kara ssc tk and mh. I took a raiding break and skipped most of Bt. Came back a bit for swp. I also leveled a sub rogue for pvp and had a little fun in bgs and arena during raid downtime. I enjoyed wrath too. Not quite as much as BC. But it was fun, that you could pug raids was quite a concept (only so far as just before putri tho). Raided with some raid guild's off teams up to the dragon before lk (sindragosa?).
---
Cata I switched realm on an rp realm, found a new guild and had a lot of fun. Up until mists. During mists I was mainly playing the ah and not much else.
---
I moved house and at that point moved out of wow too.
---
Once settled I thought I'd go back to a time I liked. Wotlk on a private server. I was impressed as to how good they were but saw a lot wrong. As a software developer I figured, I could do that. So slowly I learned how the code was and did some work on various stuff in one of the open source projects (not private servers, no interest in that). I fixed some things made some new stuff too.
---
I tried both wod and bfa. Could not relate.
---
So, yes I am looking forward to classic. Sure I'll continue to work on the open source project. But for me it's always been a fun academic project. But I'm glad I can play a real blizzard classic realm again.
---
I’m in, have been since day one, no content created ever.  Checkmate.
---
2004, no invite
---
I haven't had a lot of experiences with crashing because of betas and stress tests ;)
---
LF Enchanter Fiery Weapon
---
So you want them to use animations from modern wow in classic...?
---
What trees did you put points in first as you were leveling?
---
Honestly I prefer the one in the beta
---
Warriors have two roles in which they are extremely good. They are the best tank and are very good dps.
---
That is simply why it will be the most played class. No other class has 2 high-end viable spec. Warrior is the only one.
---
Hello friend,  
---
Expect the grinding to be much harder, I haven't played the latest wow extensions, stopped at woltk but I can tell you about my experience as a 12 year old playing vanilla.  
---
On my vanilla rogue I have 44 days played, of which 22 have been spent leveling and another 22 doing dungeons and some raids (was young so I didn't go far at 40 man raids).  
---
Anyway in all those days of playing and without being a massive pvp fan I didn't even get full T0.  
---
We used to run the lvl 60 dungeons as 10-man raids and some where even done as 15, you could expect at least another guy in the group rolling on your piece of gear set, meaning you had 1/18 or 5% chance getting the piece of gear you wanted (9 classes set). And these dungeons were at least 1 hour long (and I'm being soft here).  
---
Of course with todays knowledge we'll probably won't be running those dungeons as 15 man raids but more like 5man group for most and 10 for one which requires more people.  
---
On top of that we know have BIS dungeon gear which doesn't include the full T0 set. But man the feeling of achievement when getting a full one.  
---
Being harder it is obviously more rewarding.  
---
By the way I still miss my T0 head piece :P.   
---
I hope you'll love it !
---
Your right. Young scavenger. My bad.
---
I'm in too... and I've made 4 videos of everquest raids that have maybe 400 views.
---
World of Warcraft Classic is the 17th highest Twitch viewership in history, not the first. https://www.twitchmetrics.net/channels/peak
---
And it's a poor argument since Twitch wasn't a thing during TBC or WotLK launches.
---
he has a /afk macro bound to 1?
---
but why?
---
I thought of it, druids look really fun! Problem is I want to pvp and raid, and I can't find a spec that does both(no guild want a hybrid speced hybrid class).
---
So I'll most likely go warlock, which looks fun, but not druid in the wild fun
---
I am perfectly aware of that kind of argument, but this isnt it. Breaking immersion would be if the undead rogue suddenly pulled out a laser pistol and started frying people. That would go against the theme of the game.
---
Sliding around while you play as a corpse animated by dark magic, is not the same.
---
That does suck.
---
They definitely existed in the early freshman level and humanities courses for me, but the hard hitting stuff always gets right to business because there's just too much material to just spend one day going over a syllabus.
---
I don’t like you
---
Not the younglings !
---
Make a 29 twink in classic and it’ll be very close to this level 30 meta you speak of (:
---
Let's use mage as an example.
---
The standard AP frost spec is: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0icofquZVA0c0s
---
If you have a PvE spec you're going to be missing, iceblock, cold snap, shatter, frostbite, perma frost.  Basically you are completely gimped for pvp as the standard AP frost spec, it's just not even worth pvping at this point.
---
Now let's say you play the standard imp CS pvp spec: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oroVsobZZVVGhsbtho
---
Now you're missing elemental precision, frost channel, POM, Arcane instability, AP, Arcane meditation, and Arcane mind.  Technically you could drop some points and spec into Winter's chill and be the winter's chill mage which would work, it still wouldn't be optimal, and you'd only want 1 WC mage in the raid anyway so if more than 1 mage wanted to play this spec you'd be losing a lot of DPS.
---
Now the counter argument is you don't need to play optimal specs to clear MC/BWL and I agree with that.  The issue is that most guilds aren't going to bring raiders who are playing unoptimal specs.  You can look at private servers as an indicator of how it will be.  I never saw any guilds on Nost/Anathema/LB/ND that were willing to accept players who raid using pvp specs.  Typically when you apply to a guild there's a section within the application that says "Please link your pve spec", if you link a pvp spec you almost certainly will get denied or asked to change your spec to a pve spec in order to be accepted.
---
I get that back in 2004-2006 people could raid as pvp specs and no one really cared but that's because the game was brand new and people didn't really know/care enough about using optimal specs.  
---
In fact I have a video of a mage on my server who was in a good guild killing C'thun with a pvp spec: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eRN-8NP4_4
---
You can see from the video he's playing Frost/Pom spec with no winter's chill, see people back then didn't care about playing optimal specs, which is part of the reason why raids were "hard".
---
Also talent trees were changing constantly throughout retail vanilla, so it wasn't clear what the cookie cutter specs were.  Vanilla patch 1.12 is 15 years old now and everyone pretty much knows the cookie cutter specs.  Basically I don't see how we can go back in time and forget how to play in order to justify raiding a pve specs.
---
Another issue is that websites that track raid stats didn't exist in vanilla either.  This is something that seems to be overlooked but it's a huge reason people try hard in raids in 2019, do you want to be the guy who's at the bottom of the DPS meter and it shows up on a website and everyone in your guild can see that you are clearly getting carried?  These websites motivate players to min/max since they want to be seen as valuable members of their guild.
---
As it is right now, 50g respec costs just seems to do more harm than good, since it deters players from participating in pvp/pve, you basically end up just being pigeon holed into one or the other which divides the community.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe there will be lots of guilds that play like it's 2004 and accept players who play sub optimal specs and are okay raiding as an artificial "hardmode" with more wipes / longer raid times etc, although I doubt it since we have data on how players play today with private servers.
---
What will happen is the fad will fade once they realize they can’t play certain classes the way the can play now or have raid with 40 people, and not the 40 person raid the brought back for the anniversary event.
---
Stop feeling entitled. You are no more deserving of a beta key than my friend, a content creator, who has no interest in classic WoW and hers is rotting.
---
Content creators are maybe 0.1% of the beta.
---
He only plays discipline. Snutzy plays shadow. Not many playing holy
---
What's stoping you from creating a gnome on retail and "travel to elwynn forest to hunt murlocs" ? 
---
oh right, nothing.
---
This subreddit, jesus christ.
---
It’s more like..”hey don’t judge an entire game on the first 1 minute of gameplay just because you didn’t kill a wolf very fast.“
---
Ive known this, but the Streamers i mentioned literally asked for access 2 days ago and got in this morning. Its kinda BS
---
Protection for blessing of kings 👍
---
Out of curiosity, where there ever any old gods/refrences to them in the Warcraft games?
---
Wrong classic MMO :D
---
B b b Bogg on the beta.
---
Where are the pitchforks? The OP said his comment made him sad. Not really a riot in my opinion.
---
But druids only had one spec in vanilla?
---
I REALLY hope trainwreckz doesn’t end up playing for too long. he’s so toxic
---
Theres plenty of better options than ret pally
---
In vanilla the big raids are onyxia (40 man), molten core and black wing lair (40 man), zul'gurub (20), ahn'qiraj (20 and 40), and naxxramas (40 man). They will unlock in that order as the game progresses on. Essentially your goal is to start teaming with a bunch of friends in your guild to unlock the tier sets for your class in each of the raids to prepare yourself for the next. Tier 1 in MC through tier 3 in naxxramas.
---
You will start out preparing yourself to raid by running smaller high level dungeons with your friends as a way to get your gear ready. Including a smaller mini raid (upper black Rock spire) which has tier .5 gear sets
---
so you really think there will be need for tanks because everyone is rolling warrior?
---
Best thing imo in Classic, or the old WoW anyway, was how everything was based on reputation, of some sort. 
---
Nowadays, its cross realm based, so people dont really get to know eachother the same way like they used to.
---
In Classic, the people you met mattered. Like, you wanna add that good guy from a dungeon, weither it be cause you enjoyed his humor, or he was a good -insert his role here- because you may need him later on, or maybe he would be your contact for joining in on some of the bigger guys in the good raid guilds.
---
You see some of the same people every day in Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Ironforge or whatever. Chatting and getting to know people mattered.
---
It's kinda hard to explain what it was like. Sorta like one big family of a sort.
---
Sure, Crossrealms had its benefits in some ways, like faster Battlegrounds or quicker ways into an instance.
---
But achieving getting 5 people together in the old days, and beating a dungeon together, felt like an achievement in itself, because you had to work with what you could find, if that makes any sense. :)
---
Guilds had reputations too, like you kinda knew who was clearing each raid the fastest on the server, like the best raiding guild.
---
I dont know how that is these days, cause I haven't played much WoW since mid Cataclysm, but I'm sure cross realm things makes it a bit less personal.
---
Vanilla WoW felt like there was always something to do, or achieve. However, while the game may not be as hard as people claim it was, it sure did take time and effort to get attuned for the instances, or getting the dungeon tier set.
---
Didnt say ONLY CC's and streamers are in...
---
original one looks awful with sprint, literally slipping on the dirt
---
I personally have 0 problems with the beta animation. I don't mind the more exaggerated movement of the arms and feet.
---
I think layering should only be active in starting zones and nowhere else. I personally wish layering didn't exist but I see servers having huge issues with the masses of players at the beginning life of the servers. Good catches though, I'm sure this issue occurs in a lot of locations.
---
pretty much anytime you can buy yourself 30 seconds, you can kill a boss, i often farm corpsemaker solo while levelling
---
I think it's fair that they have the drawbacks they have in vanilla. Now it could be doctored up a bit but the utility and sustain they have shouldn't be coupled with the raw power of other classes that have to give up the all-aroundness.
---
Because you're basically forced to heal if you want to raid.
---
You arent paying 100g to craft an item. You are paying 100g so you dont have to level an alt or change a profession and spend 100g and hours of time to max it out yourself.
---
Yes you did.  It’s your first sentence.
---
I'm afraid this really isn't true, as someone who was GM/RL for close to a decade of a highend guild the further in to the expansions we got the worse the grind became. I can't speak for BFA but prior to that the mythic+ grinding for AP alone to get to 35weapon lvl in legion to prenerf helya mythic alone was a hell. 
---
After that you grinded m+ hoping some stupid trinket would roll high, it never stopped. I'd trade that crap for vanilla herbing any day.
---
Because of this finding recruits capable of raiding at that level became harder and harder due to the interest dropping in the game.
---
&gt;  There are hundreds of good MMOs out there, and they have big, active player bases, since people love these games that means the problem aren't other MMOs, the problem is within you. If you can't enjoy anything, it's your problem, not the game's problem.
---
'No' to literally every single one of those statements.
---
Problem that resto druids have in pvp is that vanilla is very bursty so rejuv and regrowth arent very helpful. And shamans should preferably be elemental in pvp.
---
&gt;Yeah, TBC is trash. That's why burning Crusade subscriptions were higher than classic subscriptions back in the day, and so-called fresh private server burning Crusade servers Drew droves of people as well.
---
Wrath had higher sub numbers as well, and the peak was in 3.3 or Cata.
---
So does that mean Wrath/Cata &gt; Vanilla/TBC then?
---
Wait what? but CC's and streamers are more deserving when they never played it? maybe sarcasm idk
---
Uncultured swine
---
Going rogue, because vanilla rogue.
---
all 3 builds are awesome imo. fury is great but there’s gona be tons of Arms too
---
You've got about a week before homework is due 😎
---
Wow! It’s almost as if they made a marketing plan for the release of wow. Who would have thought?
---
Fun fact: When WoW came out in 2004, it was suppose to be the more including and casual experience compared to other MMOs at the time. Not saying you're wrong, just the irony in what made vanilla great, killed it as well. 
---
*Too much ends in smoke* - as you would say.
---
The 2nd one, this Wednesday is bumping the max level to 10. Do you mean the tentative scheduled second one that was suppose to take place in June?
---
I understand what you're saying. I played vanilla nearly every day from 2004-2007. I'm excited for Classic because I feel the social experience, community, and RPG elements were vastly better than in the current game.
---
Other than those things though, I think it has some major short comings. Having a good community and making new friends is awesome, until you find out your new friend wants to be a tankadin or moonkin. So you won't ever be able to raid with them once you hit 60 because those specs are utter garbage, or they quit the game when they realize the spec they think is fun with is entirely useless for most endgame content they want to do.
---
I definitely would be much more excited for a BC classic, as I think that was the best iteration of the game. It had much of the same philosophy as vanilla, but greatly improved almost every aspect of the game. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the change from 40 man raids to 25 man.
---
Sweet baby Thrall, I know how it feels, bro...
---
Content creators are not more deserving than anyone else, but they provide a service for Blizzard to use. Random invites, and some have gone out, do nothing for Blizzard on the whole.
---
I don't believe the imp said anything during vanilla besides random noises it made
---
He also knows she will die before Classic comes out :(
---
I like the newer one. The old one is playing the animation way too slowly.
---
It wasnt literal, but the only ones still gettin access and priority I mean. Couldve worded it better
---
I actually felt the opposite way. At least in the stress test my mage was tossing fireballs like there's no tomorrow and I could easily go 23-4 kills without drinking
---
Something they fail to understand is that only leveling to 5 on the stress test is not an accurate representation of the classes and gameplay. Level 20 is when things really begin to pick up. But hey, that’s one less person we have to hear crying during classic :D
---
I used to have this series downloaded on my hard drive so I could just let it play on my second screen while leveling. It was so good.
---
Yeah first week is a toss up if you're in your first year taking 101 courses maybe lol.
---
Honestly people are coming up with these elaborate ideas on how Classic should progress, and while theorycrafting is fun, I think they're missing the bigger picture completely and not being too realistic.
---
WotLK was by far the most popular version of WoW, with arguably the best balance between casual and hardcore content. While it had its flaws (i.e. the raiding system changing meant for the first time WoW had obsolete raids released during that expansion) one look at how popular WotLK private servers are shows that it's very likely the most loved.
---
If Classic does well, there is VERY little chance that they don't gradually progress onto WotLK. There's really no reason for them to bother with new vanilla content when they can go into TBC then WotLK with minimal investment and expect a surge of new players. Where they go from there is a complete coin-toss based on how player sentiment is at the time but we're talking some 4-5 years down the line.
---
The only thing that's worth asking is if they'll let people stay on a vanilla server if they don't want to move on, which they may, but honestly, guilds and communities will largely just want to move to the next expansion so I don't know if it's a very substantial question.
---
Hey my dear,
---
my guide was made a special private server in 2012/13 and the gear i used followed progressive itemization (thx for stating this [xum2604](https://www.reddit.com/user/xum2604/) ) and a was working in harmony as a full gearset. Shadowpanthers list is also right for comparing single items by themselves.
---
In the end you have to make your own calculations, just because most people wont be able to use the exact gearset, most of the time we have it mixed up with all kinds of items while we progress through the dungeons.  
---
My personal favourite always was the Ebon Mask. It wasnt included due the fact, that it wasnt available at the time on that server.  
---
So about Ebon Mask:
---
AP &gt; Hit = Trashmobs / Dungeons / Farming requires way less HIT than Bosses, so the Ebon Mask is way more attractive.  
---
And since u only need 3% Hit from Gear as a minimum (assuming Combatspec), its not worse or maybe on the same lvl for bosses.
---
Kind regards Oto &lt;3
---
Ok, so you just linked the wrong patch then.
---
It's basically the same idea as in modern WoW: you want your character to be more powerful, by leveling up, finding new items, etc. The main difference is that Vanilla has a much slower pace of leveling, with many, many more interesting milestones along the way. 
---
For example, hunters look forward to getting a pet at level 10 (you did not start with one in vanilla), shamans unlocked each of their totems separately at levels 6, 10, 20, and 30, paladins completed a quest to learn their resurrection spell, and so on. That's to say nothing of the old talent system, spell ranks, new abilities, and item drops. There's a constant drip-feed of things to learn and acquire throughout the whole process. Compared to modern WoW, where you have 80%ish of everything unlocked by level 30. Plus, there is no level-scaling in vanilla, so level-ups by themselves have a noticeable impact on your character's power.
---
Of course, this is subjective. Some people place more value in exploration, or RP, or PvP, and so on. YMMV.
---
&gt; wife
---
Errrr... You lost me there, buddy.
---
No, I linked the final form of the equipment.
---
Love poke
---
You cannot. Better plan your route if you really want a tiger.
---
They won't be making much of anything if they fuck up classic.
---
BFA was a failure.
---
Wow critical much? Retail is post Cata and almost all the quests are completely different from Classic. I leveled several gnomes that way pre and post Cata so no there’s no want or need to do that again. 
---
I am excited as hell about Classic so yes I was happy to share on the subreddit. No need to be such a jerk if your opinion differs 🤷‍♀️
---
untrue
---
In fairness: They share that fate with just about any other class that has a heal. 
---
It's not a hybrid tax, it's a healer tax.
---
I think it's too late for that. Ragnarok was his time and they didn't use him
---
Can you STOP posting these every 5 minutes?
---
So CC's are more deserving, i mean i get that
---
Bet that person is a blast at parties.
---
Just check your email! They will send you an email too.
---
and the tens of thousands of private server players who go nuts over TBC usually mean that a similar ratio of retail players will go nuts over TBC
---
loved the whole expansion here, and I know a part of my enjoyment of it (and flying again) will be because I'll be experiencing it with characters I brought through Classic, walking and riding for two plus years will, for many, rekindle the 'magic' of flying
---
Nobody wants to play paladin lol
---
We won’t have the exact same experience again. We can do things to bridge the gap, though. This community was upset that RFK could be tanked by a shieldless warrior who was being healed by a ret. I think its safe to say that we expected different from classic.
---
I think its safe to say that our expectations come from our interpretation of the classic philosophy. Dungeon elites could be made threatening because based on this communities interpretation of the classic philosophy, they should have been. I may not be making sense but hopefully I’ve illustrated that there should be room for discussion.
---
Non sense, he's got plenty of time. xD
---
People hate on streamers but it's been fun as hell to watch
---
Your endgame option is wearing cloth, healing and being a cleanse bot. Strange to think I'm looking forward to this..
---
noooo why would you say that :(
---
And that brought me to my 2nd point below....
---
I remember on release day in Lich King. I was in Un'goro on my 63 DK where I saw a 70 rogue in Kara/BT gear killing a low level. I killed him easily, and that's how I realised DKs were overpowered.
---
What followed were 5 DK dungeon runs in Outland, 10 DK Warsong Gulches, always winning easily. The only character I've ever got the Wrecking Ball achievement on was a DK (I don't PvP that much) where I went 27-0 in an AV match. All I did with that DK was PvP in the 50-59 bracket because we got a full set of blue gear and a free epic mount.
---
Ya I’m not saying don’t go bs I think u should and I deff think you should go armor smithing. But weapons are fun! Don’t let anyone stray you from that. It’s just insanely expensive. If your not worried about raiding I would go weaponsmith since you can have your lions gear crafted! 
---
But deff would recommend engineering for your prot spec.
---
Will likely main a warrior tank, then maybe level mage alt for POM&gt;Pyro fun.  
---
Played a druid tank in Vanilla.  Its was great until end-game content, then it fell off hard as I got into raiding.  Hated going from tanking dungeons to being little more than a priest battery and tank jumper cables.
---
Having them be decent while leveling is cool too. Useful stuff from most of them and you level slow enough to make them work for you. I always enjoyed crafting myself guns and ammo as an engineer for my hunter.
---
Are you watching the same beta I am?
---
Horde outnumbers Alliance like 3-1
---
It even says patch 1.9 in what you linked.
---
Twinstar confirms my info as well.
---
Stop posting streamer videos, for fuck’s sake.
---
Oh no friend, not literal pitchforks! Sorry, it was more of a preemptive post because I knew what kind of posts were going to come. If someone remembering a game as "mediocre" makes another person sad, I'm then sad for the person that was affected.
---
Majorly, I'll miss how each class and spec are unique now. The close combat hunter, the full fledge mage with only spels of their specs, and the fact you don't need to equip a bow with warriors. Class identity is way nicer now. But it doesn't make a game, classic will be superior. I hope classic switch some mentality at Blizzard. The retail game need a rehaul from 0 to the end. Another cata like extension, but full fledged that gives an experience 1 to 120 clean as in all other mmo now. Gosh FFXIV or GW2 questing is what Blizzard should try to aim. Now you start a troll and voljin is having an issue with garrosh being warlord, but you find sylvana there. It's letting me down. Classic, I wait for you. You'll be home.
---
&gt;and the tens of thousands of private server players who go nuts over TBC usually mean that a similar ratio of retail players will go nuts over TBC
---
Hahah, yeah. You mean the private server which all dies because the servers end up being 80/20 H-A ratio, so all the pvprs quit and you end up with a single faction server?
---
TBC is fine for raid content, everything is shittier than vanilla, and they add so many QoL changes as well. Its much more similar to traditional wow than it is to vanilla WoW.
---
He prolly wont, shit he couldnt make it out of the starting zone earlier. Just the hype banwagon for subs and viewers
---
*rogue*
---
gotcha! Let's use modern wow animations in classic then, spread the word!
---
Not 100% certain on that but it seems invites are completely random. I got into the stress test and I just re-subbed the other day after not playing since 2007. My buddy has played all the way thru since 2005 and didn't get invited to the beta or stress test.
---
Ya I remember during vanilla that you had to search forever to find the flag carrier if they were hiding, the flag carriers location should not show up on the map. I believe it does show up if the flag is dropped through.
---
Mage blinked to create distance, Esfand ran the other way to block the spell. When Esfand came out of the hut he casted Furbolg form which looks like a big pally heal, mage used counterspell to silence it. With counterspell used, Esfan could safely heal up. Then he used a bubble offensively to block the mage's polymorph and close some distance, allowing him to get some swings off and secure the kill.
---
This isn't true...
---
It took at least a year or two from osrs launch for it to get its own category.
---
It's going to be a lot bigger than people initially thought. I'm feeling big dick original RuneScape energy, it might just eclipse retail. It's no wonder people who play retail feel threatened.
---
"REEEEEEEEE. Streamers are the worst. They're literally the devil. REEEEEEEEEEEEEE."
---
People that post in this sub are less virtuous than I am.
---
Yeah
---
yep, fall semester will be my final + hardest semester of my degree so i won't get time to play much.. watch out 2020 cus i'll finally get to play classic
---
Would think it depends on the zones and if you feel attached to them. Vanilla - wotlk I was alliance and horde the rest of the way. 
---
I'm finding it hard to not roll alliance but I feel the same when it comes to potentially going Horde in classic.
---
Wasn’t able to get in during the 2 hour test period but i did 1-5 the next day in the human starting zone(still crowded) in like half an hour creating 5 man groups and stuff for kill quests
---
Lmao, gotta love how militant you fuckers are about broken animations. 
---
Keep nitpicking
---
Great. I have a mac mini 2018 as well.
---
Hoping i do not have to upgrade.
---
Do you run bootcamp?
---
What FPS are you getting?
---
Do you use classic settings or do you take advantage of some of the new settings?
---
Thats where i started making videos. https://www.warcraftmovies.com/pv.php?t=3&amp;l=Robbaz 
---
Youtube had barely left it's infancy, videos are still up for premium downloaded them myself.
---
The challenge isn’t the actual combat (sometimes it can be in higher levels). The challenge comes from resource, mob, and gear management, paired with the long time investment it takes to get to end game. It’s difficulty comes in a different form than other games. Besides, the persons forum post is talking about the first minute of gameplay at level 1...it’s not going to be that rewarding and fun a minute in...
---
Was it zul grub that was intense at the start? Everything hit like a truck
---
Don't be offended because you watch them and the truth hurts your feelings.
---
You sound like someone who follows steamers. I guess everybody wants to feel like a part of a community and when you're a loser in the real world, your internet friends are all you got
---
I guess then the fact tht people are making a 'big deal' of most popular streamers going Alliance in Classic will tip the faction scales towards Alliance in a big way...could very well tip the other way for TBC
---
then again, and as it was 13 years ago, each server will have its own specific A/H balance. You don't like the balance on one server, you roll elsewhere...it's the freedom we have that private server players didn't.
---
And all those things you don't like about TBC...a big part of that is, you know where we're headed. BFA. So *any* moving away from Classic you'll interpret as a worse thing.
---
But nobody can say exactly how they'll receive TBC...because they can't predict how their gaming sensibilities will change after 18 months of Classic. And they will.
---
Nice, me too. I recognized the text and coloring of the semester schedule dates haha. I’ll be playing Horde on a PvP server, maybe I’ll catch ya online sometime.
---
BGs in vanilla eventually were crossrealm. Having to wait 2 hours to get into a BG on low population servers was awful.
---
I think all the popular streamers are going to be on the same realm the rest should be fine
---
This has vanilla wow offtopic forum written all of it.
---
i swear i tried this in bc, travelling as undead to bloodelf zone, and i couldn't accept any quests before level 6/the second town
---
I know and in a way it was. I came from Dark Ages of Camelot into WoW and it was so much more accessible. We didn't have these Quality of Life changes yet though. Even if you are a casual player I think in the end you will appreciate the challenge and sense of community more then the convenience of groupfinders and cross realm / sharding tech (layering is not sharding btw) and lootboxes.
---
I will never be able to put in the same time and dedication in Classic as I did 14 years ago. I have a fulltime job, a relationship. Responsabilities. Still I am convinced that every second in Classic will feel satisfying.
---
The big streamers are all going to same server, it's gonna be the one with 6 hour queue. Just pick one of the other ones.
---
I'm starting med school in July... I'm in trouble.
---
Oh i didnt know they were holding another one. Yes, I meant the ones that were scheduled ahead of time not any added ones.
---
I mean, that'd ruin the experience for those streamers. There aren't thousands of relevant streamers. Deal with it, it's really not that big of a deal
---
Yea, not everyone thinks this game is the greatest thing ever.
---
And back then it was considered awesome. Still is imo
---
Another aspect is that level 60 is required for raiding and it's by no means a guarantee that at this point all the people you plan to make a guild with will make to 60. You'll probably have better luck finding reliable players once you are 50+ and can see who's already made the dedication to getting good and spending time on the game. If you're a fast leveler (I imagine that a lot of the people interested in forming reliable raiding guild will be planning on leveling quickly) then keep an eye on people who are also leveling fast on your server, as they probably also want to look for a raiding guild if they aren't part of one already.
---
You could also roll on a private guild in the mean time and group with the players on a raiding guild there.
---
I have very little interest in PvP or high end raiding. My goal in classic is to make gold off of classic in the long run. If I can't contribute to my guild by raiding on my limited schedule, at least I can lend a hand with getting mats with my gold.
---
Making gold in current wow isn't as appealing because it's only really used for expensive mounts or in game time. Classic wow requires it to maintain your character for progressing. Plus it's a lot harder to farm gold without daily quests. Blizzard used repair gear to funnel gold out of the economy and daily quests were pumping it back in.
---
My point is that because there isn't a focus to push players into Pve or PvP, you can get creative on you want to do for your endgame.
---
I haven't played WoW in a decade. Buying a new PC to play Classic with my brother-in-law. Hats off to Blizzard for milking this game for so long.
---
These guys are delusional. If blizzard goes down the shitter because they're main expansions aren't getting exposure and the sub numbers then they have no real incentive to keep classic servers open.
---
Yes but what about the eventual new streamer which become popular on twitch after release? Sure for the current ones they will go but the new ones creates will not be locked down to any particular realm.
---
And it could do all 3 roles!
---
This warms my heart to read. There’s still hope for us.
---
No boot camp, just MacOS - 60fps all the way to about 4, then about 45fps up to 6 on the gfx settings, and then down to 15 FPS on 10, using modern settings. I’m also using an ultra wide screen so it’s rendering more than normal (2560x1080). I changed to a 16:9 screen @ 1080p and got an extra 5fps.
---
Anyway perfectly playable with good frame rates.
---
Flying from SW to IF is pretty much the only instance I can think of.
---
You don't fly over Loch Modan, that is to the east of IF.
---
I don't remember mobs ever doing this in vanilla. Seems really off, they should just rotate when they're on top of the player
---
I actually have a date set for my wife to experience WoW for the first time with me through classic. I'm excited to show her the world for the first time!
---
I'm trying to decide whether I should have a "playing with wife" character plus one main, or something else.
---
Yes but that is forgetting the flood of new streamers trying to get famous which will be inevitable when classic is launched.
---
It's an mmorpg, get currency get gear kill mobs and kill players.
---
Thunder bluff would like to have a word with you.
---
Your grades will suffer, focus on your studies
---
And the hournet to get to STV al of a sudden felt so worth it afterwards. You had worked for it.
---
Once Classic releases, streamer viewership is going to plummet into the dirt.

Syllabus week*
---
Similar. I've always been Ally, want to roll Horde this time
---
Healers that do a decent amount of dps or spend a decent chunk of time dpsing/debuff/cc whatever like they do in Retail, is a very new idea. For most of WoW's life (and most games in general), healers mostly just heal. Some healers also have additional support to do like Holy Pally in Classic with buffs. But keep that in mind when you think about playing a healer.
---
It's also a much more slower paced game than Retail, and more relaxing. So you won't be frantically switching targets and frantically switching between healing and dpsing and doing a million things with high pressure and fast combat. Most of us are looking forward to the slower pace and can't wait for it. 
---
But just keep in mind that Classic is going to be different from what you are used to, so don't go in with the same expectations as Retail.
---
As a company it makes more sense to prioritize streamers than random players. What do you think a streamers job is to do? Play video games so naturally they would be more desirable. Also the added benefit of free promotion. A win win situation for blizzard.
---
Stonecore too
---
I don't think it will at all, people have been min-maxing since wrath, and horde objectively the better faction in TBC both in terms of racials for both PvP and PvE. There is also no geographical advantages for alliance in TBC (I guess being closer to Karazhan is the only one), and thats why Blizzard gave humans that OP as fuck racial in wrath to make all the pvp players go alliance.
---
Wpvp is dead in outlands when the rush 70 settles down, contesting outlands when there is flying is awful, farming resources as alliance is awful on Outlands due to the limited good farming spots, and if you are vulnerable to ganks at the same time its evern worse.
---
They added portals everywhere (no longer will raids gather up and actually run to raids, they all get summoned), Azeroth is mostly an obsolete continent, and Outland supports a significantly population than Azeroth.
---
TBC is good for raiding, but everything else is a massive downgrade imo, and are steep steps towards the downfall of WoW once again.
---
Yeah I've never quested as ally. So i like idea.
---
I was going to, but then I remembered that Orcs have +25% stun resist and there’s no way I’m fucking with that as a rogue.
---
Ret is best profession.
---
Yeah spell batching is vanilla
---
Yes but once release you will have a lot of new streamers who will not be locked down or coordinated with the current famous ones. And even having just 1 streamer on a realm will destroy it. Which ia very likely especially if wow becomes as popular as it was. And due to it being very meme and lol worthy.
---
Orc warrior masterclass with engineering!  :D
---
Warrior
---
... But maybe Priest
---
I guess that doesn't measure up to a bunch of random streamers suddenly showing up to ride the bandwagon for extra clicks.
---
The small things like this all come together to make classic what it was back in 04 and what it should be in August.
---
Yeah, pretty much. At least theme park mmos anyway.
---
As well as palidins
---
Druids are not used as anchors at all in AB.
---
AV they are just healers because healers are always needed.
---
Iron grenades are your friend.
---
That was a jab at three people who each had about 20 posts in this thread just spamming the same private server screenshot as "proof" and insulting anyone who believed Blizzard. They've all been active in the past few hours and none of them have acknowledged this or any of the other people who did similar comparisons. And they're probably going to keep doing the same thing in future threads where private server errors make them think Blizzard is wrong. Sad!
---
I don't disagree. Sockets are also extremely potent.
---
Whos Peggy? whos Steve Rodgers?
---
Yeah Peggy dies in 2016 and has severe dementia at the time :(
---
Honeymoon
---
The slower walk looks much more menacing.
---
The guy is a bit special, thinks LFR is the whole raiding scene hence the 5 people AFK and kill the boss.
---
I bet he doesnt realise that you can have 5-10 people AFK and still easily kill Rag in MC cause you know its not a difficult or challenging fight.
---
lmao this is a solid quote, I'll be remembering that shit
---
I think having it kind of like a controllable flight point might be cool. Maybe you need to stable it at a flight master or something
---
LUL
---
Really good find, that's a weird bug
---
Ehh.... it's not a lot atleast. I tend to ask people I group with how they got beta and all of them thus far have said they got lucky.
---
Well there's no need now because there's no realm community whatsoever in retail. They'll be useful once Classic launches though.
---
Vastly
---
If you look at faction proportions they're still way above Druids though!
---
Im not worried about this at all. First of all the anti classic crowd must be fuming when they have to scroll past all the top streams with over 1k viewers to get to their bfa trash streams. Second, the game is going to go so far down on the list when they split classic from bfa its not even funny. Bfa will have like 2k viewers and classic will be steady 30k+. YOU THINK YOU DO BUT YOU DONT hahahaha cucked.
---
Hmm, ok thanks
---
Okay I hope it stays the same. Do you happen to know if pet size increases with the size of a certain race as well?
---
It's like the history of WoW has been the normalization of everything valuable worth working for, from weapons in vanilla to talents and mount special abilities in BfA.
---
But if it doesnt and sure the current streamers are coordinating but if we have a flood of wannabes with even a small but dedicated following with just 1 per server it will tank the server.
---
I’ve heard most of them are pretty Ratchet.
---
Shaman has Healing and DPS and they also seem to be heavily affected by the Hybrid Tax as they only have one Raid Specc.
---
Are you sure you're not thinking of Stoneskin?
---
True, but I'm rolling a healing class because I want to heal. I feel like most druids don't want to heal because they're on raid heals which can get very tedious.
---
i wasn't talking about alliance/horde ratios in TBC there at all; I meant in general, it's gonna be hecka popular
---
but yeah, on many servers the faction balance will swing towards horde in TBC
---
the downfall of WoW also being the 'WoW formula' that Blizzard chose to base each expansion on. New content, new areas, old areas become leveling-only content (aside from specific future inclusions that 'give' players a reason to be in those areas)
---
but hey, at least as far as pvp in Classic, like we've seen...players don't *need* a reason to plan fun, engaging PVP events. and they can plan them anywhere, even in older 'leveling content'
---
but that's only if they want to take the initiative. and they can take that initiative for 'fun' in any expansion
---
“You vs. The Staff She Tell You Not To Worry About”
---
Just in case anyone missed the title the first two times.
---
I assumed it would look bad to compare to private server, I'd rather take the data from official servers for this to be taken seriously. But I tried on a Pserv for my own information; it works like Vanilla flight paths, tilt and all
---
It's not that easy to become a popular Twitch streamer lol
---
Most of the streamers that get high viewership have been making videos for over 10 years. 
---
Maybe you'll have someone on your server that gets 30-50 viewers? That's no different than a guild leader collecting donations for guild raids.
---
Ok. So with Bootcamp the results might be even better, great.

I have been reading all this stuff about system requirements equivalent to those of Legion.

---
Chad: wears formal clothing, still shows beautifully sculpted arm muscles.
---
Literally the exact opposite of the truth. The only folks threatened are in this sub. This is literally a thread where you guys are upset that there might be a significant population who don't like Classic. Retail people don't care at all about it, and it certainly doesn't render any of their achievements irrelevant. What a ridiculous thing to say. 
---
This subreddit is completely obsessed with outside perception of the game, as evidenced by this thread whining about the likes that post got. As evidenced by all the threads asking for Twitch to separate Classic and retail. As evidenced by the deranged McCarthian witch hunt for anyone who exhibits any sympathies for retail WoW. The fact that this was even worthy of a post at all is crazy to me. You don't see retail players worrying what the Classic community thinks of them. 
---
I have to say the biggest conclusion I've made since I started reading this sub is that I don't think people here are very secure in their love for the game. I don't think so many folks would feel constantly compelled to shit on retail players and belittle everything they do if they were. Feels like you're projecting and trying to convince yourself. 
---
We got what we all wanted. If we're secure in knowing that we're getting a game we genuinely love, we should feel no need to even pay attention to shit like this. I sure don't care. 
---
I've never seen another community where belittling others or having things that they can't have seems so essential to the experience lol. It's no surprise it attracts so many unhealthy people.
---
People can’t wait see retail die, thats the truth.
---
Good find that's definitely an issue
---
No better time to start than where it all started
---
Whats so funny? The numbers in vanilla was around 3 -5 million not the numbers people remember from late tbc or wrath. Vanilla could easilly hit that number again. And have 1 streamer per server with a dedicated army of followers which monopolises resources and punishes anyone who tries to interfere will tank the economy and thw realm.
---
Oh yea definitely, I always loved playing shaman because enhance is like gambling, ele is like a turret and resto is in my opinion, the most fun healer
---
Deus Lux brother, we shall not bend the knee.
---
Now compare "WOW" to "WOW Classic" to get a more correct data
---
There is no both sides on this. You know full well where 95% of the toxicity is coming from.
---
Says who? When’s the last time you fixed an MMO?
---
It wouldn’t hurt to try.  The big barrier to current wow is to play by yourself leveling or boost and be confused.  Classic brings back a since of community where those will be there with you and helping out.
---
&gt; Hold on, are you talking 6-7 months total for phase 1 and 2 or 6-7 months each of phase one and two?
---
At first my plan was 6 months each, but some responses I got made a lot of sense and it would be stupid to have phase 2 be that long. the 6-7 months thing was phase 1 and 2 combined. that way you get phase 1 content, and a month or a little more of phase 2 (say 5-6 months phase 1 then the month of phase 2) before going to phase 3. So phase 3 would be about 7 months after launch, followed by 6 months in between other content. 
---
12 months of MC/Ony is way too long, I hadn't looked close enough at how they laid out the phases.
---
Some people are just in denial.
---
He hasn't even raided in a decade and he thinks he can speak of the current state of the raiding scene...
---
Classic raiding is pretty shit, and it's definitely not hard from a mechanical standpoint.
---
But that's ok, because classic has other things going for it. It's ok to admit vanilla isn't literally perfect in every way.
---
Surely there is a turbo button on the server.
---
It's probably an easy enough fix, I would imagine. If they copied the old flight paths, my guess would be that the points on the path didn't have their pivot information copied as well. Maybe there's a reason for it with the new client. In any case, an engineer could probably write code to apply old pivot values to each dot on the rail. I don't know for sure how their system works, but having done some world building myself, it sounds fixable within the remaining time.
---
Dont be so Silithus is just a thread of puns!
---
they wont
---
the game is built on legion; not vanilla
---
so, the best thing you can do is hope that blizzard sees your post

If some people like you reacted first, my post would be drowned before most people could see it, but as you can see, this actually matters to a lot of people, so let's just be gentlemen and respect each other. We think this is important, I'm voicing it. You think this doesn't matter, well we disagree.
---
I hope more are at the 50% mark
---
i just want to try it u know. surely i can control myself.
---
Nah dude it was definitely Protect. 
---
At that point we were more worried about being pushed out the fate arena by 100 ton swing than actually dying.
---
Hahaha, Silent, bro, buddy, you are defending RETAIL FUCKING WOW and calling someone else a tumblrina. Cmon breh. They hid Sylanas' belly because people complained about bodyshaming. Come on fam. You're on the wrong side here.
---
"It sounds like this isn't the first time someone has said something like this to you."
---
This was pretty funny btw, well done.
---
is this actually more efficient though?
---
That video is classic! I haven't seen it in probablyover 10 years
---
Super ! Thanks for the video ! Are you planning to do Paladin guide too?
---
Pretty sure also the other day a Blue came out and said they pretty much halve all the beta testers they need for some time.
---
Are you in the beta? If not how do you know it’s untrue?
---
Fair enough and that is true but due to the natural production of funny moments embedded into vanillas gameplay. It makea it very meme worthy and therefore even the smallest of streamers will be able to become over night sensations meaning whether they like it or not they will tank the realm.
---
Is this really militant?
---
Sorry OP and I want to give feedback on the beta, I know BFA beta was great right? 
---
Enjoy your game, I will enjoy mine.
---
I think they have learned from their mistakes and have found ways that work and ways that don’t work. Like with 8.2
---
I very much agree :)
---
I rather the retail animations... Look way better in my opinion.
---
Could someone make someone make a hunter/mage guide as well? Awesome guide!
---
You get more honor killing people yes, but in a premade you get the most honor from winning as fast as possible. So the rogue defends the flagroom while the rest of the team goes for the flag.
---
I hope this is fixed. I remember the patch when they updated these animations and it no longer felt cool to stealth anymore.
---
Madseasonshow and Frostadamus on youtube both mask great quality Classic/Vanilla videos!
---
You can't possibly understand why someone would not prefer the slower gameplay in Vanilla? 
---
I mean objectively we already know more people were able to enjoy the game after Vanilla, so why is this unreasonable to you?
---
If you truly love it and are secure about this, this crap really shouldn't bother you.
---
Silly week*
---
These animations stayed there for quite a long time, it got lost a long way down the road and not adressed, but it definitely shouldn't get into Classic
---
Played in legion, I spent tons of time outside the raids grinding for upgrades that came from outside the raid, also had to grind m+ and world quests for chances at legendaries which were retarded and hard to get the correct ones you needed. Sure you weren’t farming gold or herbs like in vanilla but the grind was still there.
---
Dark iron and stuff.
---
Didnt this retard delete his character or something ?
---
Looks to me the screenshots on the right aren't using the Classic graphics present.
---
That's my fiance you're talking about! We're getting Maraudan 8/27. You're all invited!
---
From what Blizz has said, you need an active sub to get an invite.
---
If you do not see the drop down, you do not have beta.
---
thanks, this is awesome I need this
---
The post doesn't seem to be about killing the wolf too slowly, it's about running out of mana after casting 4 spells
---
Looks like your failing.
---
If the player numbers exceed their expectations they can always just create a bunch of new realms.
---
You've got it all wrong. Absolutely nobody is playing alliance on their own accord. The majority is horde.
---
Should of gone to that school on the quarter system 😉
---
WoW added a lot more to the game with every expansion than it took away, people just didn’t like all the additions.
---
IMO, the focus on end-game raiding is what killed WoW and if Classic players don’t change their mindset, it will die too. Outside of progression, which isn’t really progression since it’s all been done before, raiding is going to be maybe 3 hours of your playtime a week. MC can be cleared in under 30 minutes and Ony can be killed in under 20, so until Phase 3, that’s 1 hour a week. And we’re not talking the uber-geared here, those numbers match up with the gear those encounters drop. Blackrock Depths takes longer than Molten Core ffs.
---
If your plan is to spend ~120 hours leveling a character just to spend 1-3 hours a week getting ~30 pieces of loot for 40 players, you’re going to have a really bad time.
---
You need to Chillwind out and cool that Molten Core
---
No no. If you're looking at pathing, spawn points, creature AI and all this kind of thing yes. But, I can tell you the taxi (flight master) stuff is entirely client side. That is the client has a list of taxi point and nodes and the server just sets it on its way.
---
The server needs to follow to provide into about objects en-route. But, the main show is done by the client.
---
Horde Paladin main here, I prefer faction over class. I would roll paladin but I can't stand Alliance aesthetics. I'm rolling the horde 'equivalent' in classic, the shaman.
---
10 people AFK maybe if your guild is strongly geared but 10 people being AFK would be unacceptable in the guild I raided with even well after MC was on farm, so I wouldn't really know.
---
You wouldn't be able to have that many AFK in AQ and Naxx though.
---
No, grey quests reward no rep iirc
---
It was a quest mob the guy probably was waiting for too and wanted to group so he’d get the credit too. OP just didn’t want to. So... I blame 1 for anger issues and the other for not wanting to be helpful 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Hi, /u/TheMako
---
Right now it does, but I don’t think it should. I reported it as a bug.
---
Classic raiding isn't shit, you think it is. It's OK to admit you don't like something that most people like. It doesn't have to be shit just because you were last on the DPS meter back in the day.
---
What makes you say that?
---
Utter nonsense, petty, and cruel. The game has very gradually changed into what it is.
---
There are far more BC or WotLK folks who lost their game than Vanilla fans. The difference is that for now only you guys are getting it back. 
---
Being this resentful over it is extremely pathetic.
---
Maybe this is a bug, or maybe I’m remembering the fine details wrong, but when you queue for BG’s at the Battlemaster in the city, it teleports you back to them once the BG is done. If I’m correct, it used to teleport everyone in the group to the Battlemaster afterwards. Currently in the beta, it only teleports the group leader that queued to begin with. I couldn’t find any evidence to support my memory of it being the entire group, but I thought I’d chime in to see if anyone else has any input.
---
A lot of streamers have pledged their intention NOT to reveal their server/faction until after launch.
---
Where did you download them from then?
---
The thing is - it isn't tedium. It's the internal rules of the vanilla WoW universe. A hunter needs arrows to be able to fight. When you start chipping away at that ruleset it starts eroding the feeling that you are living in a real world with rules.
---
And sure, there are plenty of areas where suspension of disbelief is called upon. But overall the "tedious RP elements" are why Classic feels like an actual world your character is participating in.
---
yeah but nobody knew about vanilla and vanilla launched the rising popularity back then. And bc boosted it even more to wotlk and then it started dying down heavily even before cata and a lot in cata.
---
Without sl you will suffer unless deep into destro spec.
---
Doing your Quests in stranglethorn, then getting camped by 3 alliance players, typing in /1 that you get corpse camped,then organizing a counter group to Stop the Camp and now  Camp them.
---
Then you take look at the watch, realize 2 hours  are gone and you didnt even continue your Quests - but you had Fun!!
---
Yep,that was vanilla
---
By some people's reactions I think it might be illegal.. I hope I don't end up in the Stockade
---
\#savage
---
If you're interested in it, I don't suggest retail (BFA). Nobody will talk to you, and you'll essentially be playing by yourself - even if you're playing with other people. Classic is DEFINITELY a better bet.
---
Content creators don't get beta "in priority", they get beta "in addition to"
---
Like journalist got first peek on video games since forever
---
[Monkeynews says Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzQ4P6huu6M).  So does [this guy solo'ing the Whirlwind level 40 class quest at level 30 using an Engineering item to tank the mob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4q69fW47oM).
---
Y'know, I noticed the the flight points looked really janky in the beta but I put it down to "oh they must just be vanilla animations" when it was the complete opposite the whole time.
---
Dude that is hilariously bad.
---
From pservers over the years I've noticed that while leveling stormwind usually takes the cake for where people hangout and it doesn't really change over to IF until closer to max.
---
how does this pointing this out change anything? It's not blizzlike 1.12 on beta lol
---
Lmao, I can play both games you understand that right?
---
I played every expansion since vanilla and I'll continue to do so because as much as you salty fuckers want people to believe the game isn't even that bad right now. 
---
You guys just make me fucking laugh everyday with how far you're willing to shove up your own ass anytime something gets challenged as a "OMG VITAL GAMEBREAKING CLASSIC EXPERIENCE ISSUE"
---
It’s about 120 hours of playtime to get to 60.
---
Do you honestly think any large contingent of players is going to put that much effort in just to follow some guy that streamed his Beta experience?
---
Sure, NP.  I have unlimited PTO, make enough to own multiple houses, a nice car and vacation anywhere in the world.
---
We will have these people though.  Because all their friends will be playing classic.  So they'll join to be with friends
---
seriously? this is a shitty thing for people trying to avoid them
---
Just because bfa rotations are "braindead easy" for you doesnt mean they are harder than classic ones... wtf. That makes no sense... by default you press more buttons on retail than on classic raiding, or pvp.
---
PvP is not a measure at all... PvP difficulty is purely determined by the players, not the game. Even multi-glad people say that... the level of difficulty of a match or a fight is determined by the opponents skill level compared to yours, not the game itself. Besides classic has a lot of cookiecutter specs that can oneshot people with minimal skill and gear... pom+pyro says hi. 
---
Such a spec doesnt exist in bfa, you always need to press more than 1-3 buttons more than once to kill someone in bfa... thats called APM and the worse player you are the less apm you have which means the less abilities you press per minute, and that has a direct impact on your dps.
---
In classic tho? theres SIGNIFICANTLY more downtime, in every area of the game... even in pvp since combat in general is slower, CCs last longer and such. And you can get lucky and crit for huge dmg and win... windfury is a great example, not a very skilled build to begin with but literally anyone can destroy someone in pvp with it if they just get lucky. 
---
The APM is alot lower = more accessible to any kind of player, elderly or young. You dont see middle-aged gamers play starcraft 2 competitively... the APM is too much for them to keep up, same goes for BFA vs Classic.
---
PvE is literally the best way to measure casual friendliness... most casuals end up doing pve more than pvp to begin with. 
---
Whats the most complex class dps rotation you can think of in vanilla?
---
I can guarantee you any rotation in BFA is twice as complex as that and pvp rotation is pretty much the same for maximum damage output.
---
So in short = classic is more casual friendly no matter how you try to put it. Id like to see you start comparing classes in both so its easier to point it out.
---
It's far more common here than it is there. Only the difference is that this person is saying they don't like the gameplay, and people here like to call names and personally blame retail players for killing Vanilla, or something. They like to claim everything anyone achieved after Vanilla is pointless and not noteworthy at all. 
---
This community feels like a bunch of people who think this game is somehow going to make them forget about all the mistakes they've made over the last 15 years, and thus they feel personally threatened by anyone who even slightly doesn't like something about it. 
---
Retail WoW community is not even close to this. It is actually crazy what I'm seeing here on a daily basis.
---
Well done man, any chance you're gonna put the addon up on the twitch client?
---
Feigning death in BGs. I forgot all about that. Some of my most hilarious memories come from the days when that used to work!
---
People still do this  xD
---
Lets not forget about fear ward for raiding.
---
Nobody here thinks vanilla was perfect.
---
But this concept was made because of Vanilla enthusiasts, and it’s been clear since they announced it that it would be a true Vanilla experience. Accept it or don’t play it.
---
Isn't mediocre kind of what we have been wanting? To go back to a time when our characters weren't basically gods? To when the struggle was real BECAUSE we were not prepared?
---
I mean, the guy just hopped out of the ground. The one that woke him was probably thinking well is this one going to run off and die alone in a pumpkin patch or is he another shmuck going to go start another damn Inn and hand out white rocks he found on the ground?
---
I can't believe how many warriors are out there lol
---
That's what they want you to think :o
---
They would have to remake the image entirely. Possible I suppose but seems low on the list of priorities.
---
Which is what I was doing.
---
Thanks! Took all summer/fall to make the meme and the title took all Winterspring! Worth it though
---
You put it like that. Aye fair enough.
---
Keep posting more
---
Just FYI, not to be that guy but the slippery slope fallacy doesn't apply to the #nochanges argument anyway - because they aren't arguing that Step 2 is logically necessary if Step 1 occurs, they are arguing that Step 1 will very likely lead to Step 2 based on X historical precedent. So the different is logical necessity vs. a likely outcome (and you can argue for the outcome with empirical evidence). Just saying.
---
I can't wait to tank I've been leveling a tank warrior on shrivate pervers to practice. I always leveled a hunter
---
Not true. On my priest I would tap it with shadow word pain and another higher level player (usually a group) would take it down fast and I would not get the kill. I'm certain that I tagged i first with SWP.  This has happened many times now.
---
In BfA yes.
---
Well if that can help comparing I'm sure people got it under control, I did my part *insert Starship Trooper meme*
---
Spirit tap then wands.  You should be using wands as much as possible.  There's a really good one that drops out of BFD fairly early on that will carry you a long way.
---
Since you reported as a bug you must know what patch changed this, right?
---
True vanilla experience. Most of us played while at school
---
Yet another thing they're half assing.
---
Disappointing.
---
Besides a streamer one of the priority criteria is the age of your account. I got in 2nd round with a 2004 wow account and I’m outside of the US in Aus, that also might have impacted for a different perspective.
---
Hp and Mana pots popping just while doing normal quests because your HP and your Mana are actually taxed during normal gameplay instead of being trivial numbers.
---
Exactly and it's scary as fuck that post nax content is actually a popular idea. It's like if you want world of diablocraft, play modern, that's literally what modern WoW has become. Modern is still in development, Classic isn't an "in development" game, it's an already finished game that needs a massive bug fix in order to be preserved. I understand the MMORPG market is stale, believe me if I had the choice of something better than WoW that's new and innovative I wouldn't bother with WoW anymore, but why the hell in the current state of MMORPG's would you risk destroying something we already know to be good (not perfect) and something we can always come back to even if it gets boring. I'm all for separate legacy servers for BC and Wrath, in fact I hope BC happens I love BC, but omg, I'll lose all hope if they make Classic+ a thing because even if they do expansions guess what we're getting. 
---
Pulling my hair out between the F r E s H modded server idiots and the modern players trying to sabotage classic.
---
We should really just ban any post that has anything to do with BFA. Or make a megathread where people can keep telling themselves how much they hate it and love Classic lol, since it seems to be super important.
---
Ouch, I'll take the Hinterlands and leave
---
Yeah, I had to re-write this post without the explicit name of the server cuz reddit would let me post it. They probably have a paid agreement with blizz.
---
I've never really been tied to a specific faction but probably going to roll alliance since I already found a guild to play with
---
I know you can in vanilla as I made the run many a time. BC might have had some phasing bullshit going on.
---
i dont understand how someone could tolerate wod but not bfa
---
its because shadow word pain needs to do damage. its not who does the most damage, it is who damages it first.
---
ya people today see that as tedium as in the people who like current wow. Every expansion removes something that feels like extra work yet contributes to the immersive feeling. Like mob tagging and herbs now lasting a bit longer after someone grabs it so you can too. I play BFA just to world quest and its just about how fast i can get it done. And blizzard makes the game based around that. I think people today have a hard time understanding that having to remember to bring arrows and the like is actually a good thing. I suppose that gets into the instant gratification argument
---
Just because there wouldn’t be a WotLK without Vanilla doesn’t mean Vanilla gets to claim WotLK’s record-breaking numbers as its own.
---
OP is using Twitch metrics to judge the popularity of WoW Classic at launch and says it will be as big as WoW Vanilla at launch (which he claims was the biggest phenomenon in WoW history).
---
If you added up every single participant in this subreddit AND every individual viewer across every Classic Beta streamer, you still wouldn’t reach WoW Vanilla launch numbers.
---
And you wouldn’t reach even 1/10th of the WotLK launch numbers.
---
I really hope they bring back vanilla weather and night time. It really needs to be there. I have been watching the streamers, and I have seen none of it. I am worried they are not including it. We need to make sure Blizzard knows about this!
---
So glad I graduate in June. Timed it perfectly.
---
There are no mobs to kill, they're all dead. :)
---
Yeah I think people are underestimating the amount of new/and old players who haven’t played for a long time.
---
The other thing, no one knows if it’s going to be easier or harder than those private servers.
---
This is just 100% what I can remember and it’s going to be sick to do it again!
---
good luck. classic will be massive twink servers.
---
"Change only the things I personally want changed."
---
PTSD the shitstorm they crucified hunters with.
---
All my friends tend to agree on all the chipping away of most things that made vanilla the best game in the world.... But none of them had their class butchered as hard as mine was lol.  So i think I'm always a bit more salty about it.
---
lol what
---
Lol... as someone on a 21:9 monitor non of the load screen old or new fit the ratio and i'm fine with that.
---
I'd rather sticking with the old artworks and just adapting them to fit the widescreen resolution. But any update would be better than the old ones IMO - it is something we will be facing every login, so I think it matters...
---
Consumables.
---
I wish i could unlearn everything and experience the game for the first time again.
---
this is the best time to start, you get a second chance
---
No, I left that for Blizzard to figure out.
---
Should be the sticky in this sub.
---
It should be whoever touches the mob first.
---
Vanilla in a nutshell. Classic community is pretty hateful.
---
Fix your monitor to not-widescreen ratio
---
Beta =/= Release
---
It's purely cosmetic and completely immaterial. A waste of development effort.
---
I remember this mentality when j first started private servers. You will learn.
---
Thats not ganna help anyone. The ppl who want to fuck around with streamers will do so no matter what. Makes it harder to dodge their server.
---
Should be.. yeah bit its vanilla. A lot of things are and are not as it "should be" this is how it was and have been for a looot of expansions and years before I think mop or wod
---
&gt;this information was not available to your client in vanilla.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
But them I'd lose game resolution...
---
So he gave up after first wolf...  
---
Actually faster than we've imagined.
---
If this is anything like my experience with the release of old school runescape (ik not the same game), enjoy and soak in the nostalgia because it doesn’t last forever. Reading these comments reminded me of the beginning of osrs, and the online community that emerged (and is remarkably still thriving) thanks to the player/community focused style of game development. I hope you all enjoy being part of the foundation this legacy server is being built on!!!!
---
They are not great at tanking.   Warriors are great at tanking; druids are ok in 5 man content, and even then warriors have more tools.
---
She's just mad because she can't get pregnant... her womb is Barrens
---
Because he looted a pristine tigress fang which is for a level 33 quest.
---
See here's the thing. I love raiding. It's the main reason I play WoW.
---
I enjoyed vanilla raiding, I enjoyed TBC raiding, I enjoyed Wrath raiding, I enjoyed Cata raiding, etc. You get the idea.
---
But raids have come a long way, and they are just vastly improved in modern wow to how they were in vanilla.
---
Vanilla raiding is garbage. It's still fun simply because of the social aspect of doing it with people you like and have fun spending time with,
---
But objectively, it's awful compared to retail.
---
I've always been a top % player,  and I also play healer. So no, I don't have any concerns about being "last on the DPS meter" i'm afraid.
---
If you find vanilla raiding challenging, that's great. I'm happy for you that you can find content of that level an engaging challenge. I wish I could, but it's just a snoozefest. And no amount of spamming shadowbolt for 95% of your casts or 1 button to generate cp then 1 to spend it is ever going to be conducive to difficult content either. Even the class rotations/design is so simplified in vanilla for raiding,
---
And someone who hasn't raided IN A DECADE almost should probably realise why their opinion is somewhat flawed.
---
The game releases August 27th. They don’t put every beta on twitch.
---
Make this status if it’s not there by October
---
How can you even have the real vanilla experience when not playing on a 4:3 screen. Smh
---
Rams?
---
Out Now In Beta
---
I would tell you if I knew myself :| 
---
Stuck decided between several classes at the moment.. Rogue, Priest, Warlock, Mage, Hunter
---
It's really not though. It's a bug test run and nothing more. You're missing nothing and preserving and enhancing your classic experience by not playing the beta.
---
He misspelled it once?
---
Wasn't this the video that got Terran Gregory hired by Blizz as their Cinematic Director?
---
We always had "syllabus day" however the further I got in to the degree, the more it was "syllabus + lecture day".
---
I feel bad for being such a pessimist but BFA actually got rid of my preorders for everything, not just blizzard stuff. Even games I know I will get day one (dragon quest builders 2, please come faster!!!) I just can’t bring myself to pay for in advance until I see it come out and my friends tweet that it’s great
---
I bet blizzard timed the release with school and work to lighten the server load....
---
You and me both buddy.
---
The game's charm is made of details in my opinion: the random NPC's selling funny items, the small events in some quests, the /joke lines... I know it's low priority, but aesthetics matter.
---
The tax is that you are forced to tank most content despite wanting to DPS.  Not to mention the slowest leveling and most tedious farming in the game.
---
Druids are literally the best defenders in AB my cata baby friend
---
you'll be better off leveling after a few days after launch anyway. the mobs in the first few zones are always going to be dead.
---
I can think of 9 better alternatives...
---
You miss loch Modan fight path that way
---
They have so many diseases that the area between their legs is called the Plaguelands
---
I started when Cata launched as a Draenei Shaman. Couple of issues with that for Classic, but I’m going to open things up with Shaman again.
---
It's about 120 hours of playtime to reach level 60.
---
Do you honestly think any significant amount of fans are going to put that much effort into the game and then decide to follow some guy that streamed his Beta experience rather than continue on with their end-game progression?
---
Streaming WoW is popular right now because it's a closed Beta. WoW Retail streams have never been popular, nor have Private Server streams (before Blizzard had them removed from Twitch). Streaming WoW Classic is going to plummet into the dirt.
---
If you're not in now. You're probably not going to make it.
---
In 2 years have Burning Crusade Classic as a separate game from Vanilla Classic. You replicate your character over to begin fresh BC with your already geared Vanilla character. Classic continues unharmed.
---
Nice man
---
gawds...
---
I played a NELF hunter in classic, about level  38 or so, killing mobs in stranglethorn for one of the many kill x-number of pirates/raptors/tigers/etc.
---
Had an Epic Bow drop from one of the Mobs..... Hurricane..
---
I nearly fell out of my chair.   Suffice to say I carried that Bow for a long long time.. even after BC dropped.
---
Good times.
---
Hi, /u/hobo__spider
---
&gt; I know it's do-able to get Night Elf tigers pretty much with every other faction on Alliance side. Doing all quests at the right level to ensure max rep  
---
How sure are you about this?
---
I would disagree.  I had way more time with just a normal day job as an IT.  School I literally would stay at school all day, get home, do homework to 12, go to sleep, wake up at 5 or 6, repeat.  This schedule was my last 2 semesters.  It fucking sucked.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
This is such an oddly beautiful screenshot
---
Twice. "oallys" and "pay".
---
Plus "VA illa"
---
And "bud"
---
And "traid"
---
Why not both? I've never really played Horde, but I'm ABSOLUTELY going to make a Tauren shaman this time around, in addition to my Alliance characters.
---
Yes, but most raid leaders are going to designate resto druids to raid healing with hots and telling priests to only focus healing on tanks/specific groups/targets.
---
losing sleep and caffeine.
---
How else do we get going on Path of Exile leagues....
---
28 days here in England.
---
I skipped out most of Cata and all of MoP so I think WoD was enjoyable to me purely because I hadn’t played in a while / was so used to FFXIV. Going into BFa; I’d played legion without a break so I wasn’t as giddy to go back to WoW. 
---
I don’t think wod is better but I certainly enjoyed it more. My class played a hell of a lot better back then compared to BFa
---
Wow you Blasted Lands that guy so hard, all that's left is Un'Goro Crater
---
I'm torn between going Shaman or Priest for healing, or Warrior for tanking.
---
I played Paladin on retail but I don't think I'll enjoy how Protection plays and Holy looks incredibly boring.

---
There's just a couple of clips to prove you wrong :p
---
I think a lot of people are sentimental about WoW.  Even now, there aren’t many game experiences that can compare to it. I am still in disbelief that Classic is actually happening.
---
It's definitely in the beta! :)
---
 My two main concerns were poison procc cast animation and stealth animation. 1/2... Hopefully 2/2 fixed before release.
---
Current plans are for 55+, which should be doable as duo of shammy and warrior
---
Considering switching to Horde myself this time but in your case it should be an easy one. Ally questing is something that should be experienced once at least
---
The battle res alone is why people will enjoy having druids there.  1 feral cat in a melee group and even 1 boomkin along with several resto druids.
---
Thanks, please keep it up. I really hope someone with beta access can test it out.
---
If you're a blind Blizzard apologist or a soccer mom, sure.
---
They can offtank pretty competently, too.
---
Anyway.. On the subject [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuw60bW67E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuw60bW67E)
---
This is comparing Wrath of the lich king client to classic beta (Esfond video). Simply because I don't have a vanilla server to hand, to connect to, to create a true like to like path.
---
That said, the map was pretty much the same and the oddness you see I think is just down to client timing different.
---
What you can see is yes, the tilt is there. And yes, the path seems slightly off. It could be down to interpolation (wrath for example uses catmullrom curves). But, can't say for certain anything really. I've not analysed in any detail.
---
I don't think I need to. I think it's clear it's not quite right and Blizzard need to look into fixing it.
---
Exactly. The strats are the same probably just the difficulty may go up.
---
Sorry to hear that mate, life in Europe has plenty of ups, including the 20 days off minimum
---
It seemed good because mounts were such a big deal and so powerful. But, they are actually TOO powerful!
---
Single-handedly ruined world PvP.
---
Then layering will remain, as they implied with their post.  
---
I am sure we will have layering for many months, not the first few weeks.
---
you should macro petattack to the spell you normally pull with.  and put the pet on passive.
---
Not directly, but the Old Gods' minions appeared as enemies in some of the latter missions of The Frozen Throne's undead campaign. The only direct reference to the Old Gods themselves was in the manual.
---
Is he being graded on this? Or does it really even matter, especially if you knew what he was talking about?
---
I'm looking forward to it. The beta and Classic so far feel just like the stories that everybody's been telling me for the last 5 years I've played Wow.
---
They never said this... they said layering will remain until the population normalizes.  But, as the OP states, the population never drops, then neither will layering, because the server pops are increased.
---
It took OSRS years to get a separate section.
---
There can be different kinds of immersion breaking. That's why in superhero movies people don't complain when someone can stick to walls and shoot webs, but when they use Bing as a search engine and not Google since nobody does that. 
---
Things that break your suspension of disbelief will usually be minor since they are what you are most familiar with. In this case people know what running looks like so the sliding animation looks wrong to them.
---
Ele shaman is awesome in Pvp at least!
---
Yes. You don't even have to do that, there's a repeatable quest called Marrowgrain Research that you can grind exalted with but it'll take a long time.
---
I’d not play on that server if that was the case. I’ll find somewhere that will let me play what I want.
---
Yeah it’s just about execution really.
---
Layering's only purpose is to cost cut.
---
that's why you just bring your s/o to the game instead! for me it worked out really well
---
Haha!
---
If your game is only appealing to hardcore players, it will fail. It's that simple.    
---
Game devs know that, they make games to earn money, they target the real playerbase, casuals.
---
People with jobs and money to spend.     
---
Not the trolls living in their parents' basement that farm WSG 14hours a day to get a title so they can feel better about their life.
---
No, because those weren't in vanilla. It's not complicated actually.
---
With classics ridiculous grinding and travel time, you'd be able to study while playing :)
---
I'm basically the same for Shaman with Alliance
---
I joined in burning crusade and my heart always belongs to my Thanos Chad Enh Shaman
---
Thanks for feedback! Yeah I want to get cities and dungeons searchable too, will take some time to find the data etc. That copyright notice I copied from blizzard legal faq, I do agree it looks legit tho. I'll move it to a separate page at some point.
---
Shroud. Timthetatman. Ninja supposedly. Those are just three i name without searching. But ya. Those streamers careers are dead when classic launches cause there fanbase doesnt exist without it. Why worry right?? Lol
---
It comes out the day I start class for me lol
---
As someone without beta, thanks! People please follow suit. :)
---
And you know this... how?
---
The only class abilities that make you drop the flag are paladin shields, mage iceblock and stealth.
---
#Wholesomepost
---
Ahhahahaha well it is their job so your not wrong
---
Ohh.. you mean vacation anywhere in the World like most europeans does 2-3 times a year + we actually knows other continents than America? All the things you mentions means absolutely nothing when in the context of “working my ass off” 
---
I could realistically retire with a total of 10-15 years work, not even paying top taxes and not working my ass off. 
---
Honestly bro, the only thing i admire from you guys, are the Moon goals by 2024. You americans Got nothing Else in my interest. Nice try thou :)
---
&gt;Everyone with an ounce common sense.
---
So like, 10% of people?
---
I've actually bought some of these over the years when I find them in used bookstores.  Even before Classic, I just liked having them on the shelf.
---
Hundred is a big too much. But at least 2 or 3 are doing better mmorpg : FFXIV, GW2 and TESO maybe. For the former 2, a remake of wow would need to take lessons from both.
---
Not immune to criticism, people just don't want changes to the game.
---
Holy shit, thank you so much for doing this! This was my number 1 addon until it broke in like WotLK. I was seriously bummed that I would have to play Classic without it. If you can get this working for Classic I will love you forever!
---
Personally I prefer [Last Man Standing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgrPQIsieEs) because the gurubashi arena is a super fun place.
---
Would really rather they spend their time looking at elite dungeon mob damage being too low (non-boss elites).
---
In wrath someone faked an ID to blizzard to get access to someone else's account to kick them off their 3v3 team
---
I upvoted for “epeen”.
---
It doesn't change anything, but it clarifies the nature of the bug (or lack thereof) here: in vanilla animations weren't sped up/slowed down to match your movement speed (which led to your character gliding along the ground), but in Classic they are.
---
For maybe 1-2 guilds per server, you might be right.  
---
Keep in mind that the gear grind still has to happen.  It was already stated that private server values of raid bosses had them so much easier than actual vanilla was, so using those as a reference isn't logical anymore.  
---
Rag isn't going to be downed in a single week of raiding.
---
Vanilla allowed addons to do MORE, not less lol.
---
Addons are better now cause people put effort and time into them to develop them.
---
You're gonna be stuck in westfall, not enough quests. Alliance need both westfall, loch and redridge to not run out of quests in vanilla.
---
rogue?! how could you solo for upgrades on a rogue? im intrigued.
---
[Darrowshire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dTxcHulFBI) or nothing.
---
Agreed. Basically rushing for 1-2 more MC lockouts. There isn't even an honour system
---
Also i remember rolling on wowhobbs server in bc for fun and it was horrible. Itll be insane since fans now adays are more "dedicated" then anything.
---
Darnassus to SW: hardcore edition.
---
IF is a better center point to get around than SW is.  It will be the most popular just because of travel times alone.
---
Syllabus week doesn’t exist in college.
---
Summer btw lmaoo😂😂
---
If you don’t give importance to what Blizzard says, that just further proves my point that, even though the game has yet to come out, people who already want changes and content past Naxx do not care about the wants of the people who are the reason Classic is happening in the first place and are shamelessly hijacking the platform to selfishly further their own wants. 
---
People who want changes or new Vanilla content need to sign their own petitions and show Blizzard that there’s a market for such games, but let Vanilla be Vanilla.
---
Also, I don’t agree that retail is a “completely different genre” - but I do see how they can be seen as 2 completely different GAMES of the same genre.
---
Guy sees something with the classic wow beta and expresses his concerns on the reddit dedicated to the game? Quick call the BFA whiteknights, he's not allowed to do that!
---
You got him good.

You see, we currently have a pretty nice 50/50 balance.  (In retail of course).
---
You see Blood elves are by far the most played horde race. Without those horde would not be at ~50%...
---
In addition in classic alliance will be the pve faction, because paladins are &gt; shamans when it comes to raiding with min/maxing.
---
This is where I am now. 
---
I loved being on a PvP server when I was 21 and playing release in 2004 but I’m 35 now and have a shit ton of kids and a job. I don’t have time to be getting camped by 60s. 
---
I’m definitely rolling PvE for classic.
---
This is possible one of the only good reason being oceanic and not too many big streamers are from oceanic so this is less of a problem for me but i feel after the first 6-12months itll flatten out more as people will end up doing what they want and not so much as what the streamer they watch want
---
It’s actually pretty lame if you intend on spending and have spent that much time in an MMO and character immersion means that little to you, obviously this is my opinion but I’d hope if you’ve played that long obviously you have an attachment to this game beyond just having it be a dopamine exploit.
---
And we have different senses of humor if you find reading beta feedback forums entertaining, I know that makes me sound like what I do with my time is better than your usage of time but I just think that OP wants the game he’s going to be sinking hundreds of hours of time into to be the best it can be and I can’t really find it that humorous given the track record of the corporation we’re dealing with.
---
If you really want to play with streamers just roll on the US servers. im planning on playing EU on my main and pvping on a US streamer server.
---
That's about as bad as deleting it.
---
Quin has no idea how to play vanilla ret.
---
yep, therefore not blizzlike :)
---
I believe its reduced by 20% per level into grey, until it reaches 20% where it caps out
---
Some of those runs as a level 1 to a differ starting Zone are the best 
---
It’s pure adrenaline and such an amazing journey in itself and worn like a badge of armor , I remember going to Ogrim as a Tauren Warrior and it’s one of my favorite moments because I honestly didn’t know if I’d make it
---
I got suspended out of college twice. Now I'm an assistant professor. You got this.
---
Its ganna be hell and if they dont coordinate. Seeing what youtubers did to realms with fractions of viewers as streamers do now is good evidence of that.
---
Man. Let me welcome you to alts. My goal is herbalism/alch leveling. And disenchanter/tailoring alt. De items and make bags by what I pick up. Plus lots alts for the bank space.
---
Find a guild first then go to whatever server they're going to
---
So you can get exalted with Darnassus via quests only? By what level?
---
But it’s not that hard with the drowning skip
---
You are definitely alone in this.
---
If you like to heal, priest is bomb. I mained one. Instant dungeons, super good healing and defense, shadows fun to level with.
---
Same. Im here just hoping that blizzard confirms that this script existed back in vanilla and that its probably just not well known.
---
Graphical changes are fine (which they already allow you to pick new or old models) since they don’t affect gameplay. You aren’t actually moving faster, it offers zero actual impact aside from aesthetics.
---
Inb4 #nochanges
---
EST or EDT? When does daylight savings time begin?
---
For me it’s 3PDT - not taking a whole day off, but I WILL take a half day 😋
---
Zero actual gameplay impact. We already have other graphical changes made, it’s fine to make your character actually properly look like they are running instead of skating.
---
What a great idea..
---
It is so funny. Everything he says is true. And they fucked everything up on retail haha.
---
Gimme my purples!"
---
How do you go from Reign of Chaos to Auto Chess
---
Thanks for feedback! I love the idea of incorporating hearthstone locations, mage portals and other telportation mechanics into the algorithm. I'd have to fit it into the ui somehow but I could see this becoming a real time saver especially if it went as far as doing walk/Mount distance too with dungeon locations. I'll keep you examples in mind when looking into it. 
---
One thing I can add fairly easily now is to allow people to optionally allow the opposite factions boats or zeppelins in the results. This is obviously risky as you could be killed but could save quite a bit of time too.
---
Yes. It is an amazing experience.
---
A raid might let 1 ret pally in, but you really don't have much of a place as a DPS, and you certainly can't tank in raids.
---
Ez clappers
---
WotLK is casual trash. It only had so many launch subs because vanilla had gotten people hooked. How many people were playing by the end of vanilla?
---
Fuck I didn't miss high pitched xaryu voice ... Sorry just a hater here
---
Get ready to cast chain heal rank 1, 2, 3, 4 in raiding. But I will say they are super value.
---
Haha nice glad you dig it. I have them for sale on my threadless page.  [https://dustinlincoln.threadless.com/](https://dustinlincoln.threadless.com/)
---
They also just assume you aren’t stupid after you get into your junior and senior level courses. So they give you a syllabus, MAYBE point out anything that may cause issues, and then just get to work.
---
Bizarre that's the most efficient way of gaining honor as a rogue.
---
This is literally so unlikely. Just avoid Soda and Asmon and you’ll be fine.
---
Pretty good guesses. I'd imagine they have a bucket list for everything they want to check for each one.
---
I never said he's not allowed to do it, I was just pointing out he has a shitty attitude in how he does it. 
---
Just like most people living in here you guys have BFA living rent free in your heads.
---
It wont be that way in time.
---
IF is more of a center point for travel than SW is, and it makes a huge difference at the end of the day.
---
I’m also an addict
---
what?  raid bosses on pservers proven to be harder than vanilla.  and yes it will be
---
He didn’t say he was hpally someone said be that spec and the second guy meant reroll your class.
---
&gt; How many people were playing by the end of vanilla?
---
Roughly half of the amount that played during WotLK.
---
\#nochanges
---
But that would require watching their streams.
---
What in the god damn bgs are you playing where you can Divine Protection 10 times?
---
They can't really "adapt it to fit the widescreen resolution" without redrawing the artwork. Which I mean, would be cool, but is pretty high effort.
---
Wait... so if I'm talking to a girl and I notice her pupils dilate, does that mean she wants to jump my bones?
---
I’m not really a fan of picking a guild beforehand, I like to do my own thing first and then seek one out when I’m ready
---
Thats not how it works even in retail unless you are targeting them which you need an additional addon for like battleground targets which should definitely not be a thing in vanilla, at keast not in its current state. From my experience in retail nameplats appear at the max range of ranged characters or something like that. They dont appear 100 yards away.
---
Nope, I was just farming panthers in STV.
---
Not all changes were good, not all changes were bad either.
---
Classic should 100% have updated character models, for example.
---
Tier sets should respect class spec, so that warriors aren’t the only tanks, and hybrids aren’t shoved into healing roles.
---
The goal is to learn from the mistakes and remove the instant gratification fuckups of retail.
---
no way in hell is anyone getting to 60 with less than an hour per level average.
---
You’re fine - that says “Fall Term 2019...” and if you frequent this subreddit, you KNOW that Fall doesn’t start till September 23. Don’t show up to class until then and use the comments of all the people here saying “BuT SuMmEr EnDs SePtEmBeR 22nd!” as a scholarly source. I’m sure they’ll give you an A for correcting them.
---
I'm gonna main tank for my guild in classic. Never did it before. I'm a hardcore pvper in games (master in league, multi class glad in wow) but vanilla pvp ranks mean nothing to me because it has nothing to do with skill. I raided as a mage spamming frostbolt in MC/BWL back in the day, but this time I want to experience all content as the frontman.
---
Yeah I'll be playing both sides and I'm gonna do a pvp server this time.  Just trying to decide on hunter or warlock!
---
Tank warriors will drop off after people get a few bad experiences and don’t want the responsibility anymore. Speaking from experience.
---
Actually true btw
---
94 more days
---
Many streamers have pledged their intention of hiding the server name from the community before launch, so good luck avoiding them.
---
Been playing mage since vanilla and I aint gonna stop now.
---
Gonna love being a mage again in a time where my ability to make portals and conjure food actually mattered
---
I'll admit it, you got a solid chuckle out of me. At least we don't associate with *gnomes*.
---
This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard omggggg lawddddd save me from this fuckery imagine being this retarded 😲
---
You are missing this:  Blizzard officially, publically are giving beta access to anyone with a large following on Twitch or Youtube.  There is a webpage they can apply.  It's no a secret. Just people don't seem to know about it.    
---
So, yes, every single big streamer gets beta access quickly.
---
Yea I'm gonna reiterate what I said. You guys are fanatical with what you constitute making "the game the best it can be" if you fucking think a broken animation is what will make or break the immersion and the quality of classic. 
---
These animations were fixed for a reason and its because they were broken on release. 
---
The only thing lame in this subreddit that I have seen so far is the lengths people will go to try and claim broken things make the game better. Then double down and shove they're head in the sand when it gets called out.
---
Every single large streamer who asks Blizzard gets beta access. There is a page they request this separate from signing up for beta.
---
How is leveling as horde? I did level a shaman to 60 back in the day but i don't really remember having fun leveling, compared to alliance, which i mained, and have a lot of good memories from. My memory is really hazy though as i was very young back then.
---
Some do, others don’t. Some are going to rush to 60, some will good all a ton. All that matters is they have fun, and it’s okay for them to take off from work to relax and enjoy a hobby.
---
My roomate at the time played a druid and was the main tank. Only the top guilds really give a shit about class min maxing. You will be fine as a druid tank, or even boomkin if you want. Smaller guilds are just happy to get the numbers.
---
4 years of pserver experience says otherwise.
---
And I didn't even play cata LOL
---
Upvoted for actually linking info instead of just stating an opinion
---
Has Blizzard even announced Oceanic WoW Classic servers? If we're going for an authentic #nochanges experience, you guys should be stuck playing on EU or NA. ;-)
---
I couldn't give a shit about buffs. It's vanilla, it's already grind enough and early vanilla content is ez
---
While that is true, what is more astonishing is that classic can keep the viewers. BFA Launch dropped from average 200k viewers to below 70k rather quickly. Classic can keep 100k steadily. Classic Beta also has the highest viewer ratio in the history of WoW on twitch. These statistics indicate a higher interest in the game over longer periods of time.
---
Hi, /u/ZeN_csgo
---
I feel like you don't understand the "slope" concept of slippery slope.  No one is saying they will suddenly make drastic changes... That's like the opposite of the concept.
---
And, like I said in my previous post, no one is really worried about sweeping changes like flying mounts or LFR, rather tiny changes, which might make Blizzard (due to human nature) feel more comfortable with small changes that could have large effects.
---
Also, changes vs nochanges, in their very nature, make LFR more likely, even if it's still very unlikely, so it's plenty logical.
---
Once I got teleported to Moonglade by some random event (Lunar Festival?).   
---
Knew nothing there. Couldn't find Flight master. For some unknown reason wasn't using Hearthstone (maybe I was retarded, idk). So I decided to make a run to Darnassus. I was level 20.
---
You know you are the wet bags of content creators if you’re making this guide.
---
Can you do a 1-10 herbalism guide?
---
Did it in full judgement and topped the healing charts every night. I may have been a Healadin but I kept my plate and self respect 😜
---
I kind of did this with my very first character ever. I was level 11 in Darkshore and realized one of the ships went to the Eastern Kingdoms and I really wanted to go to Stormwind.
---
Realm: Ragnaros 
---
Hands up!
---
Maybe he did fuck if I know I just remember it being really cool of him to do that for me
---
Fair enough i personally wanted a group of people to level up with and then work towards raiding with them. But good luck avoiding the streamer servers
---
Its going to end up just like runescape and OSRS, two comunities that say shit about each other and play what they like lul
---
You can go from Menthial to Ironforge in less than 5 mins.
