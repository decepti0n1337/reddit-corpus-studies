That’s the spirit
---
---
---
Hmmm, I'm not sure! 
---

---
Maybe! 
---
These kind of [debuffs](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=5159/melt-ore) can be cured, for example.
---
If you can't PvP without gouge then do gouge instead of reflex, lol
---
No, intellect you tard
---
I already have a pool of over a hundred characters to choose from, so I'm good.
---
I spent the gold to train the important ones and made it back in about an hour of questing and selling greens on the AH.
---
Yes.  Shadow priest may thematically be warlock light but it really plays very different and if you don't like pet management it's better in that regard too.
---
From my understanding 30/0/21 is the best spec when you first start raiding. I could be totally wrong though. You would just spam shadow bolt anyways
---
Came here to say this but now I don't have to. Glad someone else gets it!
---
But cats has stealth...
---
i hope you strapped your belt on tight...
---
The idea is you're never alone, and people just try to interrupt and cc paladins because no one can get rid of bubbles. Blessing of sacrifice/freedom and dispels and holy shock will eat up most of your gcds.
---
They’re just going through a “phase”. So rebellious
---
What spec were you playing?
---
Haha no.
---
Damn that's super rough
---
Well besides masochism, I enjoy it because it spices up the game. Pull, kill, heal, pull, kill, heal, repetitively is boring to me. Random acts of murder switches that up and keeps me on my toes.
---
That and nothing is more satisfying to me in WoW than weeks later seeing someone that ganked you and returning the favor then corpse camping them.
---
The best is when you are drinking for mana and the group just leaves you there sitting and they start fighting......nobody ever waits for mana
---
Definitely nature damage. Like a shaman shock.
---
"Enter the World of Warcraft..."  I WILL TEAR THEE TO PIECES *shreds box*..... Rolls rogue.
---
Yes they do.
---
I wouldn't play with a negative nancy like you anyway.
---
Yeah, I can’t believe how many elementals there are!
---
He wanted to pick the better combo tho...
---
Lionheart helm likely will be at launch, because it was added in 1.3.  They really aren't gating anything pre 1.5 it seems, and I don't see why a helm added 3 months post launch would be something needing to be gated anyway... most people back then weren't even 60 at that stage yet. 
---
If by some miracle you get this plan early, armorsmith is extremely good money.  Much more feasible going for arcanite reaper plans though.
---
Yes, but you can't be sure that your kids will turn out nice people, and carry on what you passed to them. And maybe they won't want to care of you.
---
Should be, it was added in 1.3, which was like 3-4 months post launch.
---
You know what else classic didn’t have? Millions of players fighting to do the same quest. Try again.
---
People more worried about streamers than layering....
---
It came in 1.3, so it should be in.
---
&gt; And I wasn’t (trying to be) an asshole; but facts are facts. Tanking is by far the most complex role, commands the most responsibility, and takes the longest to learn.
---
lol wow you are really up your own ass.  First off, just because you say "facts are facts" doesnt mean everyone is obligated to take your unsupported claim as true.  Ether source it with examples or dont be that asshole that claims everything is a fact because you "know" it to be.
---
Secondly, really dude tanking is by far the most complex role, rofl you really expect anyone to see you as a reasonable person when you make ridiculous statements like this.  I cant wait for you to tell me how i dont know anything since you are going to claim i dont tank.  I've already addressed your bullshit of claiming anything you believe to be facts.
---
And lastly, please let me know what names you are going to be playing, i would like to avoid you and your terrible attitude and gaming style like the plague i will be on classic wow.
---
Now you can ether take this post and do a little self reflection about how you are coming off like an asshole who thinks hes better then most people and become a better person but more then likely you are just going to attack the hell out of me and try to discredit me without actually addressing any of my points, i'll lay them out again to make it easier for you.
---
1.  "facts are facts" it is ridiculous to expect people to take your word as truth when you provide no support for a claim.
---
2. Tanking requires skill but claiming its the most complex role and commands the most responsibility is an opinion at best and makes you sound like an elitist shit bag
---
3. the names you wish to play under so i can avoid the hell out of you.
---
A game magazine got me into this website that would send out early invites to lots of games.  Through that I suddenly was in the WoW closed beta.
---
Like every game does Alpha and Beta early purchases.  Imagine a game not getting your money early but sending out invites via other websites that were designed to reach hardcore gamers who got onto those exclusive websites via their gaming magazine.... Yeah the internet is more efficient nowadays.
---
Much more feasible to get the good axesmith plans, so that is likely the best bet. 
---
Though if you got lucky and got lionheart helm plans (or bought them for cheap somehow) as an armorsmith, then that is easily the best money a blacksmith can make, since that is basically the BiS for fury warriors all game.
---
hashtagnochanges
---
Doesn’t carrion bird have a damage reduction screech, or am I thinking TBC?
---
“Just innervate”
---
"Nobody"
---
Think it was before that even. 1.3 is dire maul and that’s in phase 2.
---
The fun part is finding ways around it. Playing smarter, being aware of your surroundings, and either finding ways to turn the tables or escaping.
---
Great feral reading material https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#dps
---
&gt;What don't you like stillffex?
---
idk the ratio for spirit to mp5, but I imagine 11 spirit is much less than 6 mp5.
---
Stay strong brother
---
Pally/Lock beats Pally/War because SL tanky Lock can survive while having more CC with their Pally allowing them to mana drain the Warrior's Paladin. It's a super easy win my dude.
---
Its different. There's no garrison to keep you tethered and the game is actually still putting out content.
---
Poor Esfand
---
This showcases the two types of people in the world. Those who use :), and those who use =)
---
Of course it is.  Layering means less servers and server engineers.  Loot trading and right click reporting+automatic punishment means less GMs.  A rough launch might lasr 3 days, as opposed to layering staying for up to 3~ months with phase 1?  Lets not pretend these people give a crap about us please.. that is the real meme.
---
You are aware that Activision Blizzard fired around 800 people this year, despite them making money with them, right?  They had to officially report this back in January at their shareholder meeting and it was public.  This is a corporation, and they don't deal in customer satisfaction.
---
Lol so true
---
It's really quite simple. If Retail had the same 'length of learning' and Blizzard saw the use of world buffs like p.servers, they would have patched out buff stacking like they did with Decursive and Out of Combat rezzing.
---
There are people claiming this. The claims are false, the elite damage is as should be and has been confirmed to be as should be.
---
Hunters are a hard counter to mages, locks are also a big problem and druids just have high sustain, I wouldn't say that they shred mages, outlast them maybe, unless you're talking about opening as a balance druid with the upper hand.
---
It might have been, it has been so long.. all I know is that it came before 1.4 for sure because I had the helm in march of 2005.
---
You mad? Can’t say I’m very sorry. There’s a reason why tanks are severely underrepresented, Madboi. Ever try tanking? Doesn’t sound like it.
---
&gt;now
---
Enjoy it. I'm jealous.
---
My first main was a priest and I will level a priest again in classic. But this time around, I will start with a mage. 
---
I decided that this time that I would start with a class that can grind really easily and use it to support my priest as I level him or start raiding.
---
I find leveling a little easier when supported by a main.
---
You can always change your mind no matter what you pick. The first character will be the slowest, but it isn't that bad rolling additional characters.
---
Gathering world buffs and logging off for a week isn't effort. That is what we call aids .
---
Sounds to me like you're bad and are hard carried by world buffs.
---
Craft Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros myself and pwn ppl with it in PvP
---
Except the buffs arent necessary, they just are very nice to have. If you NEED them to progress you likely wont get far as you lose them after one wipe, and if not then what kind of insane guild are you in where your expected to NOT play your character for days to clear a raid you can already clear an hour faster
---
Don’t play a warrior first without any money.
---
Don’t be afraid to make alts. Use them for extra money and bags. Change toons when it’s convenient, like before you hearth back to town because it’s on cool down, or to mail stuff when your bags are full.
---
Same as above, make a bank alt.
---
Get a Quest addon, maybe user interface.
---
Get at least 12 comfortable keybinds.
---
Type “/join world”. You can type /leave world too to leave if it’s annoying. Very useful for finding groups, or just picking up on in game conversation.
---
I thought ankh was all they had, which is why I formatted it as a question! I played Shammy on retail but wasn't sure if Ancestral was a fresh spell or old :)
---
Okay then don't play the game retard bye
---
Repost.
---
Paladin, obviously.
---
Who does twinks premades wtf lol
---
Exactly!
---
Warlock.  I don't like their lore (too evil / 'morally ambiguous' but in a way that makes me think they are still kind of sociopaths) and I don't like their mechanics.
---
its not better, unless you chicken out on a pve server.
---
I plan on playing a shaman to 60 but I dont plan on raiding as I was going to focus on pvp due to time constraints. I've never done leatherworking and I was wondering if the gear you make from it is useable at 60 or if there are other pvp rewards I'll be able to replace that gear with. 
---
I know engineering is recommended for pvp and plan to switch skinning over to it once my leatherworking is maxed
---
Elite damage is normal. People's understanding of mob damage in dungeons has been tainted by private servers inaccurate data.
---
Listen ya fucking dillhole go to the other sub if you wanna keep complaining. If you don't want to, then I can't help your fucking retarded ass.
---
Level 30 gnome warriors with we axe in the 21-30 bracket will forever haunt my nightmares.
---
Cool deal thanks a bunch!
---
Ikr but the 1 twink premade in the world is coming here to downvote us lol. Twinking is just cheese af why would anyone worry bout premades and tryharding at 19 lmao
---
Orcs can't be mages until cata
---
Good thing twink players 9/10 are worse pvpers
---
I’m a naturally extremely paranoid person, so I spend all day being overly aware of my surroundings. The last thing I want is during my wind down time sitting in bed playing a game (wow) to have to feel continuously that way. But for a normal person I can see where you’re coming from.
---
No, his logic is absolutely spot on. He's suggesting that you did absolutely zero research before posting this thread. That can be proven by searching the internet and seeing that this is one of the most discussed and unanimously agreed upon topics of Classic WoW.
---
‘‘Tis man plan good sir :)
---
Perfect way of saying it
---
Agreed, but that was looong ago lol. Post Matrix, mainly
---
I can see what you mean, I suppose for myself and those similar to me that’s the reason pve realms exist.
---
Does DKP mean nothing to you?
---
I don't recall putting an exclamation mark after "condition".
---
Thanks. That's what i figured. I really enjoyed afliction in later expansions. I was a casual healer in vanilla so I wasn't even aware of the debuff limit.
---
You're comparing skillful CC against blindly slapping the healer. I agree with that. But when timing CC is emphasized to a point where resources don't matter and DPS abilities don't matter (it's just a rotation you memorize) I think it's less fun. And not just healer resources, DPS resources.
---
I'm only teasing I main a mage
---
Yesssss. This video is great.
---
What I wanna know is... Where the fuck was ziqo this whole time ven and healingstat were fighting these 2 rogues?
---
Gotta agree with you there, it's always fun to wear off pieces that aren't even the correct armor type.
---
I think the helm was ghostshroud!
---
-giving up on telling coherent stories and only focusing on disconnected, flashy cinematic moments with no build up or pay off
---
Although I wont be playing one I think Paladins are the coolest class
---
Are dwarf rogues better than gnome rogues for pvp? How would you compare them to orc rogues ?
---
&gt;They were removed in TBC
---
Probably because they were percentage based and Blizzard didn't want people to do level 60 content to buff up for level 70 content? It's not even a remotely good argument as to why you think they are an exploit.
---
Well, the easy solution to this would be to play on a pve or rp server. Assuming that they're putting those in. I'm not up on all they're planning.
---
The fact someone was removed or changed doesn't make it an exploit. Sorry you don't like world buffs, but they're a huge part of vanilla.   
---
I imagine you don't like horde players getting salvation and kings, either? That will happen, too.
---
Level cap and decent lvl 60 gear for starters. See where it goes from there.
---
hunter. Just seems like a really selfish experience.
---
If the World has no place in raids, then raids have no place in the World.
---
No.
---
Bushy and with a mixture of Greys &amp; Gingers among the Black
---
MacBook Pro 13" 2014 runs BFA pretty well, so you're totally fine.
---
&gt; If you RNG roll a low % darkmoon buff.
---
The darkmoon fair buff is entirely deterministic based on the answers you choose.
---
=)
---
That's literally what I just said, a guy in front of me joining his friends group will disappear on my screen assuming his friend is on a different layer. 
---
Have you really not watched any of the videos on layering from the beta where this exact thing is happening?
---
Starting zones being over populated for a week or two is literally the classic launch experience on a slightly larger scale, layering is an entirely different ball game that has major consequences... see Venruki cheesing the AGM trinket, see MN cheesing ore nodes and so on...
---
At least Paladins get greater blessings and can buff a whole raid. Shaman can only benefit 4 others - ideLly melee for str and windfury or casters for mana tide.
---
You should talk to different people, the ones you've been talking to are obviously morons
---
Why would I post about what I've seen whilst researching this subject and ask for further opinions if I hadn't done any research in the first place? Maybe I was right about all you salty warrior mains
---
I clearly said that if a class cannot be an orc, then undead is the next best option.
---
I feel like all of your builds should utilize improved gouge over dodge.  The first build second variation I like, but I don't know if you want to hone yourself into sword spec during the leveling process.  You generally won't respec until you hit 60, if you can.  Up until you hit 60 (and early 60), you probably will find at least one mace that looks good to you, or maybe an offhand dagger.  Those sword spec points may not be best until your first respec when you have more control over your weapons.  This of course is unless you've figured out a list of quest reward swords for your entire path to 60.
---
Then comes the order.  At what point do you switch into subtlety tree?  I agree with that tree, but the order matters.  I would run combat up to riposte, cooldown reduction, and improved sprint.  Then I would switch to subtlety (level 25) for the first 5 points followed by the vanish/blind reduction (31 and 32).  Then, I would say rush to Blade Flurry, but if you're behind the curve and you have guys on mounts rushing to gank you while you're jogging everywhere, getting 5 points in Camo might be the best bet.  If you find yourself comfortable enough to get Blade Flurry first, you'll be level 37 and might want to skip Camo, as your use of it (for PvP related reasons) will be lessened when you're on a mount at 40.  But either way, after blade flurry, rush to AR, skip a point in expertise to get AR 1 level earlier than whatever level you're going in at.  AR opens up a new world in solo'ing elites and rough pulls.
---
On your second build, it looks like your approach is to have the benefits of PvP sub build and have heavy front end ambush damage to help you through the PvE.  If that is the case, I'd still start off combat then respec at 30 so you start with preparation.  I would also recommend having a macro to pull out your dagger, and add a line in your Sinister Strike macro to pull back out a sword or mace.  That one GCD for the weapon swap will be worth it.  I would also recommend against Deadliness until you're at or near 60 as your AP will be pretty low.  Also, the benefit of Premed is so you can get a big finisher, IE Eviscerate.  If you get premed at 40, you should probably focus getting improved eviscerate immediately.  Premed, ambush, and luck on initiative gives you 4 combo points, so you can have a giant eviscerate in 2 or 3 GCDs.
---
Kenion the rogue?
---
wait hows Mass Effect relevant to WoW at all? It's barely an RPG haha
---
How important is choosing a server? Im pretty stressed about choosing one that will end up having messed up populations or just a shitty server in general..
---
Druid - You will have less potential output in any role you take on than a dedicated class for tanking, healing or dps. 
---
Warrior - Rather fragile when solo, highly gear dependent
---
Rogue - High competition for gear, doesn't bring much to the table in group pvp. 
---
Mage - lots of drinking downtime, lots of making water. Really unengaging dps gameplay in raids. 
---
Warlock - shard farming. Longest rebuff/reset time after dying. DPS rotation in raids very boring. 
---
Hunter - Dead zone in pvp. Not in high demand endgame pve. Buying ammo and pet maintenance
---
Priest  - Spend lots of time facetanking in pvp. Shadow has major oom problems. Leveling solo involves a lot of drinking or wanding.
---
Shaman - Only 1 spec really welcome in raids. Enh windfury dry spells suck. 
---
Paladin - Combat is nearly afk autoattack. Spend a lot of time refreshing buffs. Healing is also rather dull spamming.
---
Main tank will need 100% attendance. If you miss a raid, it might mean **there is no raid.** 
---
You'll need consumables out the ass, but your guild should be able to help you with that.
---
LOL. No bot macros are allowed in a classic, you'll have to actually press the buttons this time around.
---
I don't get it.
---
Yea dude. Totally gonna just have everyone in front of you disappear. Let’s not think about how each layer will have hundreds of players. Just assume everyone that joins a group disappears. Good thinking.
---
Yeah yeah, I know.
---
Furor and Natural Shapeshifter if you are going to be powershifting which is optimal for dps. This is Taladril’s [Tank/DPS build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/Axw8QATMR_zdATA)could still heal 5 mans and raids with a gear swap I imagine but you won’t be topping the healing meters.
---
Tbh might be a good idea. My little brother tried the same thing on my computer &amp; he changed his mind as he did.
---
Google Lightshope &amp; you should be able to find a site.
---
Just remember that the private server is a lot more hostile than retail (there's a lot of nazis)
---
There's a perfectly fine pve server to play on
---
I get enough Marvel memes in other shit subs. I'd prefer if my home feed didn't look like r/all, thanks.
---
Thanks. People generally love me or hate me. I state facts, but with a blatant disregard for peoples’ emotions. My dungeon group can hate me with a passion, but I will make damn sure we don’t wipe.
---
I can’t speak to the PvP aspect (other than world PvP) as we didn’t really do BGs, but I leveled my warlock with a pally and I have to say it was the easiest leveling experience I’ve ever had.  They just have so much utility between them, there are very few things you can’t do.  And for world PvP the last resort was always “double bubble”, lol!
---
It sucks to get ganked but that's what being in a world of WARcraft is about.
---
I just like being able to compete with opposite faction for mobs and gathering resources.
---
When I played retail vanilla, I went 11/15 in naxx. On FOUR separate vanilla private servers, I've gone 14/15 in naxx. Never killed KT. Looking forward to it.
---
Yeah that’s definitely my plan, I haven’t heard whether or not they’re going to, I was more curious as to why someone would enjoy the whole tanking aspect as for myself it would ruin the game for me. But I have a good understanding now.
---
Wat.
---
Hunters are the best bet.  Easiest to level, and you don't have to do shit for raids.
---
Hahahaha you watched Skarms video? Private servers ftw dude. No you won't be fury dualwield tanking at any point in Classic. Sorry.
---
Get to 60 -&gt; Tank MC/Onxyia -&gt; ???? -&gt; Profit!
---
Too many factors. It’s best to play it safe until you gauge how good your healer is. If you personally know the healer and are in Vent, sure, chain pull the whole thing.
---
I play on the newest apple MacBook laptop whatever its called. and its totally fine.  the machine gets hot but no step downs and smooth gameplay
---
leaving the shit subs may reduce the shit memes you see, which would then fix your home feed...
---
yes , this is so golden:D thanks APES! overalt epppes !
---
Fortunately* 
---
Fixed that for ya ;)
---
If you're looking to SPRINT to 60, then yes. If you intend to do dungeons, pvp etc on the way, go pala warrior.
---
Very true. I don't want to farm consumables and world buffs for two hours in order to finish the raid 30 minutes faster so my team won't do that since it's retarded.
---
I wanted to try being a tank this time around, but I don't want to be a raid tank. So I'll probably just stick with dungein tanking and helping people get their pre raid BIS stuff.
---
It won't pass retail in subscribers because blizzard is clever and make them share the subscription. So when classic gains subs they can say that retail is having a greatly increase in subs, or what ever.
---
You played with a "focus" change? I wasn't aware they ever gave that a shot. Do tell!
---
If I were to make such a change, I'd use it as a way to increase hunter capabilities while using the energy/focus system to limit the amount of burst they can do to a given player. I could be wrong, but it feels like one of the reasons hunters don't scale all that well toward end-game is due to the potential for certain classes to get absolutely demolished by a class that lacks the negatives present in other classes (melee range, spell knockback, etc).
---
More simply put, hunters should have effectively infinite resources except in their ability to dump burst damage, and any additional "combo" system would make up for any lost burst damage by tagging it on the end of the fight rather than as a nelf coming out of shadowmeld. Maybe after stacking up 5 auto-shots, your "finisher" is an instant aimed shot.
---
Don’t forget to level your professions with you. They can really help you save/make money inClassic because money will be significantly more scarce in retail.
---
For your first several levels avoid the auction house unless you’re selling something
---
If you end up finding a green+ item, sell it (on the auction house, NOT a vendor) because plenty of people will be willing to buy it.
---
The best time to level up skills like blacksmithing/engineering if you’re willing to buy ingredients from the auction house would probably be the launch of classic since collection style professions (herbalism and mining for example) don’t require much to begin and the market will be over saturated 
---
Don’t be an asshole in the game, people will remember this because the communities in servers will be much more close knit 
---
Don’t create a horde and alliance faction on the same server since players will associate you with the faction they met you on. 
---
Save up for that mount.
---
If you're talking about unrealistic situations in BGs where you spend an inordinate amount of time dueling with your teammates to maybe exploit server lag, then yeah, nah. ;)
---
99% of vanilla was standing still pressing one or two buttons. Every once in a while the boss had a mechanic that forced you to move. It was easy.
---
Eh, well a boss drops 2 items, split on 40 raiders. Probably wont get more slow than that.
---
PvE tryhards will still roll Alliance.
---
They have announced pvp, pve and rp-pve realms for release and have said at the time there will be no rp-pvp realms.
---
You won't be doing enough DPS to pull aggro, sorry to tell you
---
the craziest blue to me where these bind on equip blue shoulderpads at level 19, i remember seeing them in the auction house and being like "holy shiet", they where cloth int and spirit i believe, i forget exactly what they did but the stats seemed so crazy, and seeing blue shoulderpads when i just got dinky grey ones was like the equivalent of seeing a legendary at 60
---
Damn that's a lot of bush
---
Ruined 3conomy or ruined game. Which is worse?
---
I can’t quite taste it but I can’t sure as shit smell it
---
Did a quick math with my hands. 
---
Faction Alliance - Horde
---
Warrior 4 - 4
---
Pala/shaman 2 - 3
---
Hunter 2 - 3
---
Druid 1 - 1
---
Rogue 4 - 3
---
Mage 2 - 2
---
Warlock 2 - 2
---
Priest 3 - 2
---
Numbers do indicate balancing, guess they found the most unlike race/class combo for the alliance to get rid of. Wonder what other racial changes got influenced by this balance, forsaken priests?
---
im a college student
---
it shouldnt take anyone 2 months to get 60
---
I didn't expect it to work.   I was hoping to find some epic fail vids though.
---
I think the only important part of it is RP/PvP/PvE really. As much as layering has its flaws i think it will reduce the likelihood of ghost servers. If you’re really nervous, I’m sure once names are announced there will be all kinds of spreadsheets or info of what streamers are going where and what servers are being focused on.
---
Just makes dying more consequential.
---
How the fuck did this guy make a video And get everything completely wrong!?
---
They have pretty sisters, brother.
---
lol in late 2006. Hahahaha
---
Your friends are cocksuckers
---
Yeah I remember trying to watch arena stuff a couple of times and honestly had no idea what was happening as someone that avoids pvp like the plague, but even without having pushed keys much watching the MDI is much easier since you can compare the two groups: One team is a pack of mobs ahead or has less deaths? Very clear to see who's winning at a glance.
---
I'm sure skarm will have a few when classic releases (sorry but I hate that guy)
---
Right. Idk why i thought it was fire lol
---
Because meta-gamed Vanilla is worse. If this was rampant at the time of Retail, it would have been patched like Decursive and OOC rez.
---
This.
---
without going too in detail, it's more then just greed. politics have managed to quite literally change how games are balanced to some degree due to its influence from the internet and available information
---
Reconnect with old friends and be known as a good player.
---
As far as actual goals: recreate my first main (undead priest). dualbox level multiple characters. Level Mage as first main. Work on timbermaw and thorium factions while I level. Get all tailoring recipes on Mage. Get "insane" title if they ever add achievements (work on pre-reqs while leveling). Level and become exceptionally skilled as a hunter. Have access to all professions across my characters. Corner a section of the Auction House and make a lot of gold. Main tank a raid as a warrior. Create an add-on. Run a casual raiding guild. And implement a crazy plan that would build a stronger community but risks destroying the server (so destroying a server).
---
So, just a few things. Nothing specific.
---
I think the way I'd love to handle this is let people get them if they want, I'll get them myself, we'll use head when we can but I dont wanna pressure people with this annoying thing
---
Yay 😁 pve for life! But to those who prefer pvp and rp, wish y’all the best!
---
For 99.9% of people they never *stacked* world buffs. It's basically a  hidden trick that if popular at the time, would have been removed by Blizzard.
---
I loved jamaz too. I thought he was the best. Watching his vids again he hasnt lived up to my memory of him, but i too hope he returns to classic
---
As someone else said, the strength of paladins in PvP isn't their damage, it's their ability to outlast everyone else. You can certainly take someone from 70% &gt; dead with a reckoning bomb, but reckoning bombs are good because you sat there surviving getting beat on for 20 seconds then punished them for it. 
---
The best thing a pally can do in Vanilla PvP is protct a node in AB 1 v 5 keeping anyone off the flag, surviving till reenforcements show up. You should default to 1h + shield and switch to a big slow two hander when you need to start helping take them down.

Both these builds are good. If you're planning to do more solo PvP the second one is where you want to be, but if you're going in pre mades the first is king as an unstoppable meatshield of support awesomeness. 
---
With h both though, your goal is to out survive, not out damage.
---
I already lost this one. Already moved from what character to level and trying to decide what class to not level.

[This trinket from AQ40](https://i.vgy.me/Gz0bwK.jpg)
---
&gt;if you're interested in rolling a holy paladin and this guy put you off, they can do absolutely insane shit and have one of the most broken tool sets in vanilla.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm interested. Where can I go to learn more? is there a guide for holy paladin 1.2?
---
Your tunnel visioning on one issue and using hyperbole to brush it off as a non issue. Not even willing to debate the fact that any amount of characters disappearing is an issue and the opposite of what classic was about (server community on your own and opposing faction) and your not even attempting to counter my points on how layering affects things like the AGM and resources/economy.
---
Your not adding anything constructive to the debate. Your just being sarcastic because I disagreed with you.
---
You can't check distance, but you can switch between targets.  You still have a command to target nearest enemy and also one to target last target.  Starting with the range, you can create something, but that would still only work if one of the two abilities wasn't on global cooldown.  If it is, you need to castseqence, try to not spam and at that point, you probably should just have that "target nearest, cast melee thing, target last target" as a macro that you press after your ranged shot.
---
tldr; cast your ranged, set up a macro for target nearest, cast melee spell, target last target.  You do your regular range stuff and if someone gets up in your face, you do your wing clip and keep harassing the ranged guy.  A mouseover macro would be much more reliable too, especially when pets get involved.  My suggestion is the mouseover.
---
There is a small chance I'm completely misinterpreting what you're asking for.  In that case, good luck.
---
The long term goal is all raids and one of each class
---
But on the way I'll be having fun, not going for max efficiency 
---
Still trying to decide what my first character will be.. priest or mage, probably.
---
If layering is in all of phase 1 I hope it’s short tbh but that’s the only reason
---
Not necessarily the case for protests, however
---
Would you please explain the reasoning for this sequence, to fill in the gaps for me? I wasn't aware the white items bought from vendors were good enough to warrant spending some silver on them. Can you get the items early for both horde and alliance?
---
Is the difference between not powershifting and powershifting massive?
---
retail bad vanilla good
---
please clap
---
Hard to argue this when we're going right into MC with 16 debuff slots, 1.12 talents, non-progressive itemizations, etc.
---
Most classes had over 100+ changes between launch and 1.12 which significantly increased the abilities of the class.  1.10 (I may be off on the number) saw a ton of new items added to bosses loot tables.  And let's not act like 1.0 itemizations wasn't complete garbage, like shadowcraft boots having 21 intellect (later changed to 21 agi).
---
There's already a lot of changes making the game easier from day 1.
---
90% certain carrot on a stick was a quest reward in Zul'Farak.  That one is a winner.  BRD quests offer some PreBis trinkets too...or maybe they were LBRS.  You don't want to miss your quest reward for Mara scepter or UBRS ring either.
---
yep all these people that were forced on private servers just thought they wanted to play it
---
I had a 29 twink back in vanilla. Before battlegroups were a thing, the queues were at times kinda long and teams were not premade and usually not more than a couple of twinks per team. But when battlegroups came out we started doing premades, and it was honestly so much fun being able to do full premade vs premade in AB at 29 :D
---
So many people started twinking for a while and our twink guild got pretty big. Good times!
---
Yep.  Launching into 1.12 is already going to near-trivialize MC.
---
Right? Isn't being a twink enough? I feel like a premade of twinks is just a bit much personally. 
---
If we have to deal with it though we'll deal with it :P
---
Because most of the guild will feel he deserves it the most
---
2 handers are pretty much useless in raiding most of the time, except a few specific scenarios, so people grab them for their PvP sets. Giving someone else the two handed won't benefit the raid in any real measureable way, so they give it to the guildie who put in the most work. Hunters only use them as stat sticks, but that's pretty much it for raid benefit. I know some people are going to mention nightfall and really badly geared fury warriors, but thats outlier situations. They get given to tanks so they can pvp with them later
---
2 handers are one of those drops you DONT want to happen when you're doing progression content, because it doesn't really benefit the guild as a whole. You love them when you're farming because you're gearing everyone up for pvp and their off specs, but when you're doing the raid the first dozen times its an annoyance when they drop.
---
There's also magma totem, for when fire nova totem is on c/d, not to mention earthbind or stoneclaw to help out.
---
Tunnel visioning one issue...that you brought up as your whole reasoning why it doesn’t fit in classic. Crazy how I’m using your example against you.
---
Since the list hasn't been dropped yet this is a harder question to answer, and I'm sure you'll have a clearer picture closer to launch. Right now, the main advice you might get from this subreddit is avoid streamer realms. Tbh that just depends on you and what you like.
---
I'd advise trying to find a home before launch. The LFG Monday thread could be a great start to try and find a guild to roll with come launch day. That way the whole guild can decide on a server and you won't be in the same position you are now at launch;  worried if you've fucked up. Then you'll have a whole guild at the same level clearing the same dungeons at mostly the same time depending on how fast everyone levels.
---
Exactly this. I'm not a streamer either, but I'm in the beta. The first day I was part of the 9 hour AV, which was great fun... for the first time. I've probably played another 3/4 AV's since then and they've gone for an average of, I'd say 90 minutes, which I can deal with.   
---
Last night though, I joined a game that was already 4 hours in (I was horde) and we had destroyed all our bunkers, we had Stonehearth GY, Alliance had Stormpike, no bunkers out and their entire team was pushing from Stormpike GY against our entire team from Stonehearth.
---
Eventually some of the alliance pushed through and took Snowfall and I was like 'great, we can press on separately' I encouraged everyone to push on past Snowfall and take Stormpike. Half the horde team then wanted to fight to get Snowfall back - and they did, I pushed on with a group to take Stormpike and we did, and then half the alliance team went and took Stonehearth and then their whole team spawned back towards the cave at Stormpike and they took that back and then all of Alliance was pushing from Stonehearth and Horde was pushing from Snowfall.   
---
TL;DR: I Joined an AV that was 4 hours in, and after 3 hours the game had actually progressed backwards from when I joined. I guess that's AV!
---
This “me and my boy” stuff is getting tiresome, this one is one of the best.
---
You are ignoring that I am ONLY TALKING ABOUT LV 20-25. there is a reasion why me and many world first druids on different private servers play bear until lv 25. Less downtime and therefore more efficient overall.
---
Upvotes for Ferocious Bite???
---
In this thread:   Peeps who have never played Druid.
---
I don't think people who have multiple Rank 1 titles and do nothing but PvP will roll PvE servers. I certainly don't think getting ganked by a couple of rogues will change that.
---
Shaman was made to tank quests lol it's so weird to think about
---
Yes that is because you are not lv 20-25 people need to learn to fucking read. As that was a MAJOR FACTOR in my point.
---
I’m not saying bear is better than cat. Only that it is more efficient at lv 20-25 to stay in bear before you cat abilities and talents come online.
---
Where is the big red arrow pointing at the #1 victory Royale?
---
Get several characters BWL geared then PVP my face off
---
What ever you wanna think bud.
---
Stress test this week, hopefully the same vibe!
---
Man the fight in Moonglade on Emerald Dream was fucking great.
---
Read this entire thread for th me answe to it.
---
I really am not getting paid for this so watch kargoz speedleveling Druid guide.
---
Cooler the name the more popular the server is going to be. I think its an actual thing in retail.
---
We don't go to Ravenholdt anymore...
---
Yes. But you can get anywhere from 1-10% effect from those answers.
---
Yea CONJURED stuff did soul shards are not a conjured item. You think you can just conjure up some souls??
---
OP, I think you're in for a great experience, and it's nice to see all the advice so far! After reading through the thread, it seems you're between Priest/Mage/(possibly Hunter?) and Human, or something aesthetically similar. Here are some general pieces of advice, as well as a few class-specific things I haven't seen mentioned yet.
---
* Take your time, and enjoy the journey! *Learn interesting professions* as you go, *hop in battlegrounds* from time to time, but most importantly **don't make level 60 the top priority**. If you are comfortable with UI addons, you can even disable your experience bar to avoid thinking about it.
---
* Level 40 is a **huge** milestone for any race/class, because you are able to buy a mount for 60% increased movement speed. However, *the price can be daunting* if you don't plan for it. Consider regularly mailing excess gold to another character ("bank alt"), so that it's out of sight and out of mind.
---
* Travel time is a significant part of the journey, so it might be worth knowing how easily each class gets around on foot prior to level 40: **Priests** are the slowest of the three since they have no run speed enhancements; **Mages** are like Priests, but at level 20 they can fast travel directly to capital cities and "Blink" (teleport) forward 20 yards every 15 seconds; **Hunters** can toggle a permanent 30% increased run speed starting at level 20.
---
Finally, I'll leave you with some final thoughts about each of the three classes. If you want the option to heal, **Priest** is the only choice. One upside for healers is that groups are easier to find for five-man content than for damage-dealers, because healers are more scarce. **Mages** have a flavorful and diverse set of spells, in addition to being a reliable damage dealer. For better or worse, **Hunters** have the most RPG elements baked-in to their class compared to the other two. This includes a pet system for taming, training, and controlling beasts, but also an ammunition system requiring you to sacrifice inventory space for arrows or bullets. They also cannot be humans, but Night Elves are very similar.
---
Funny. Private server data was compared and it was the same.
---
It will be pretty useless tbh.
---
No, they don’t. Soul shards aren’t conjured. Health stones and soul stones did.
---
The “In Dreams” quest chain gives the pre-raid bis neck for pretty much any melee DPS class
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5944
---
Priests are a great babysitter, but I’d say any healing class is a great partner. Maybe a mage to share food, or a hunter to have a tank for 2 DPS classes. What do they want to roll? Maybe they want to play the support?
---
Sorry, there is such a thing as good enough. Did you play Vanilla, or only private servers? Cause I've played both. Most guilds aren't going to require them. Because they aren't needed. And no guild will keep members if they only reward those doing top damage, regardless of the reason. Guilds want, good, dependable people. Actual skill goes a lot further than a few buffs. Ridiculously and unnecessarily high standards will not be the norm because 1) it's unnecessary and 2) most people don't want to do it.
---
People should be able to get the buffs. You're welcome to make a guild and require them to raid, but good luck retaining members. You're certainly free to do so, but I doubt you'll find success with that.

&gt; NPCs which offer multiple quests may inconsistently display them as a dot or a “!” on the available quests list. They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we’ve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.
---
It would have been two lines for them to fix this.  Two.  Lines.  They even changed the xml file associated with the file to support the change!  Oh well, here's another one.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3844
---
This massive quest chain starts in Un'Goro and rewards a trinket and 1h sword or offhand.
---
There is nothing difficult about wow, never was never will. its a very casual game. just keep in mind if you want to dps in raids don't roll druid shaman or paladin.
---
It's not Vanilla tryhards saying this.  It's the private server folks who are that way.
---
I was a Vanilla tryhard, world buffs was only for fights where the raid had all the mechanics down but you had difficulty beating the enrage timers.
---
All of the min-maxing crap is from private server people who missed their chance to be good in Vanilla.  They were either bad at the game, or late to the party.
---
On the private servers they are playing on nerfed content where the only people on the server are other tryhards.  
---
When you have a raid full of hardcore players doing nerfed content that's already been solved for years, the only option is to start making up arbitrary achievements and trying to speedrun it.
---
Don't listen to anything they say.  They're up for a rude awakening when Classic gets released.  The majority of people that will play classic are going to be casuals.  
---
Most of the private server folks won't even make it to 60 because they will burn out when their progress is too slow since they won't get double-quadruple XP bonus.
---
Hmm, the first question to be answered should probably be, when did this bug occur? I mean if the bug was there throughout all of vanilla, and most importantly 1.12.1, then I guess it would make sense to have it in Classic as well. I went through a few other videos from 1.12.1 and it seems pretty clear that it did trigger a GCD:  
---

---
   
---
However, then I came across this videos where nothing triggers at all, not even GCD on shadow form itself. I wonder if its lag? Not sure whats going on..  
---
https://youtu.be/PYIRHovvAJE?t=66
---
submitted countless times and never got screenshot of the day... just thought they didn't see it or something, never considered the possibility that they didn't like it :|
---
This seems worthless.  It's not hard to figure out how to allocate your points while leveling.  Honestly, if you don't know, then you need to study up on the class more.
---
This. I remember it only becoming a problem when more people hit 60 and then were (correctly) geared.
---
Thank you!

No way paladin buffs are op and they are a warriors best pocket healer
---
What class has the lowest skill floor for group PVP? Looking to just play casually but still have a enjoyable time in group PVP without top tier raiding gear or high skill
---
Warlock is so much fun. Leveling is awesome and pvp is a ton of fun. Pve is crazy fun until threat becomes an issue
---
 don't tell everyone...
---
enhancement is the best pvp spec.
---
This was my experience as well. A couple really dangerous people you identified immediately and mostly people you could just utterly destroy.
---
Holy crap. 
---
I can’t believe this is even a thing.
---
You have dumb friends.
---
Having played Druid among other classes I really found they were the opposite of boring (outside raiding). So many options, switching forms, different gear for different builds etc.. once TBC came out with flying just turning into a bird whenever was also badass.
---
Triprunner dungarees from gnomer are fantastic.
---
Yes. Quite hidden, from the witch in Dustwallow Marsh, maybe different for Horde though.
---
I’m no expert but I think it is a pretty noticeable difference. If you are going to be primarily focused on tanking you should be able to get away with not powershifting while off-tanking especially if you aren’t in a hardcore guild. You’ll probably still out dps prot warriors who are off tanking.
---
Ugh this advice is amazing but only makes my choice more difficult! I really am hoping to go human but I also have hopes as a hunter. Obviously I cant have both but I will decide soon enough. I have time! Haha. I do want to use addons. Which ones do you recommend??
---
Ok.  How is that not fair?  If 6 others put in more effort then someone then that someone can't expect to get loot over the other.  There's nothing aspirational about being the lowest effort person in the raid.
---
Rank 12/13 gear is some of the best Tank gear you can g3t until AQ40.
---
If you go that hard sometimes your guild will even PRIO you a 2H so that you can PvP and get the ranks easier
---
Skinning sucks in classic/beta unless you're a leatherworker
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48WF9uIpZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48WF9uIpZo)
---
99% of the game is casual. So more difficulty is good...
---
The opposite has actually happened, not sure if you are aware that Blizzard already confirmed that the discrepancy between Private servers and Vanilla exists. And that Private servers had wrong data, in this case, mob damage was incorrect.
---
This is a gamedev trick when porting or making remakes.
---
You talk about little things almost nobody would remember in an effort to show consumers how diligent you are to recreate authenticity all the while the rest of the folks behind you are trying to figure out what to put in all the holes they have to fill and hope people don't notice the difference because the front man just threw glitter in everyone's faces.
---
Misdirection.
---
Legion class design was utter garbage. Absolute worthless pruned trash.
---
I miss the time before my Rogue became Rogue Lite.
---
I am going to avoid dungeon for the first weeks, the time the new players learn (and old player who forgot) that we needed to often carefully pull mobs after crowd controls and signs. I loved that! Each person had his role. But I am 100% sure this will go to the abyss as soon Classic launches and lots of dramas will happen between healers &amp; rest of the group.
---
Here is a meta compilation of a plethora of classic guides well organized:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5mh0e/wow_classic_class_guides_resources/
---
Massive time investment to rank that high though
---
My first thought is Hunter. Don’t really have much for buffing your allies, no healing, just shoot and position yourself wisely.
---
I know exactly who you’re talking about! Had a few runs in vanilla with him too!
---
&gt; be a fun spec for pvp I made a twink shaman myself back in Vanilla and it was a lot of fun, although elemental is much stronger and enhancement is terrible in pve so if you want to raid as a shaman you will have to find a very casual guild that takes whatever and slowly progress through raids which is fine as long as you accept that or you will have to heal in raids.
---
Any hybrid class (I.E. any class that HAS a heal spell) will be asked to heal.
---
If there is any advice to give to new Classic players, it's this:   Skip all content as quickly as possible so you can start raiding MC ASAP...  it's, like super fucking fun... or... umm... err...  yeah...  uueehdrrrdd
---
Yeah that's all good, except when that would also apply to things like potions. Thinking about taking a 15minute break mid-raid? Your casters will bleed 1/8 of a flask EACH and won't be able to log off.
---
We probably know each other.
---
All the min-max crap is coming from private server folks who either sucked in Vanilla or missed it entirely.  
---
Every single private server is stacked with try-hards who thinks that everyone coming back to classic will be like them.  
---
They don't understand that even the best guilds had 10-20 good and reliable players, 5-10 deadweight but reliable players, and then you have a pool of about 40 players who weren't super reliable that you filled the rest of the raid from.
---
Tank with rage:
---
"Dude, why can't you keep up?"
---
Wow is pretty good on modern macs. You can even record gameplay from the Mac wow client. The pc version can’t do that
---
It comes out on the 26th in America too, learn to time zone
---
Wait, I made this meme. Haha, cool :)
---
10+ days of /played.
---
Forbidden Knowledge gives you Skull of Impending Doom. Maybe not such a game changer for shadowpriests but any PvPer should get it. 
---
Also Nifty Stopwatch is really nice to have. Especially during leveling where you don't get many trinkets. 
---
You also have your class quest in Sunken Temple. I'm unsure whether they will be in at launch because they are usually added in later on private servers. Basically the priest one gives you (among others) a wand with shadow damage that also does shadow damage. With shadow weaving and improved wands it's quite a beastly weapon.
---
The inconsistency is part of Vanilla.
---
I guess he thinks that the talent only increases his bonus shadow dmg(like from items n shit) and doest increase base dmg of shadow spells. No +shadow dmg no effect of the talent xD
---
The road to 60 ia going to be tough on my paladin. 
---
What are least popular zones to level up in? I'm hoping I can avoid some of the zerg by traveling to those places. I know it won't be as efficient, but I'm really hoping the extra mobs and nodes will make up for it.
---
And that number? 8272019
---
Nifty stopwatch in desolate. Raptor quest in wetlands for wand. Ozze quest in wetlands for 10 slot bag. 5 water breading from easy elitquest in dark shore to name a few
---
I will be. Good luck keeping your raid spot chump
---
Bullshit, a few users compared the numbers and they were basically the same. Let's say "almost the same" Which surprised a few people. 2 to 3 more damage per attack doesn't matter.
---
You're talking about guessed armour/resist- values or parry/miss value, which have nothing to do with mob damage. 
---
Dungeon mob damage is basically the same.
---
I just mean that if you encounter any of these classes in the world as a mage you're probably dead unless you run
---
Rogues fall apart entirely if they don't get to open, half of their abilities rely on them making the first move. If they can't do that they just Vanish and go agane
---
Fake casting isn't going to help you at all if the opponents have addons, which most everybody will.
---
My main reason is the slow speed white Ram is one of my favorite mounts in the game. Just so simple and elegant; especially on a night elf! I want to start my road to exalted Ironforge rep asap.  
---
The area is also a bit nostalgic for me because Brewfest was one of my favorite events. 
---
I’d totally go there for the Owls if I were a hunter tho haha. Rolling Druid for my main.
---
I decided to give rogue a shot for the first time in like seven or eight years. Combo points are just chi/holy power now. Noped out of there fast
---
Yes
---
I’ll enjoy my self on the Tier .5 quests.
---
I agree with your comment,
---
You explained almost exactly how I leveled up, I like your ideas i will try to add them to my build to check them out.
---
First build - The general goal is to get your stealth ready by level 30-ish, First I did combat tree til Riposte, then stealth.
---
Second build - After Sinister strike I rushed sub tree till ghostly strike(15% dodge important power spike in my build), basically
---
 Sinister Strike - 2, then Opportunity - 5, Camo - 5,then ghostly strike- 1, then Imp.Ambush - 3, then just fill out rest according to situation/preference.
---
About gouge, when I used ambush build I often 1 shotted people, if not then i followed with kidney shot and killed them there, if the enemy was too tanky I just ignored them and didn't engage, or sapped and did my quest turn-ins (or whatever),
---
 remember this imp. stealth gives you great stalking potential and chance to engage in best moment.
---
How is it the same? Gold becomes exponentially easier to come by as you level. 20 silver at level 10 feels like alot, but at level 60 you get more than that from 1 mob.
---
Again, time is money.
---
+healing is worth an absolute ton, milking it out of every slot possible is what allows you to downrank heals and save mana for longer fights.  It also increases your HPS in shorter fights, so practically never is the most +healing item not the best in slot.  
---
So truefaith is better for that the + healing
---
Then 5int 11 spirit is basically 75mp + 1.03 mp/5 while casting assuming meditation talent but no raid buffs.  Truefaith is 6mp/5ec so truefaith is better for any fight that lasts more then 1:15sec, and FAR better on trash and stop and go fights like dungeon crawls.  
---
Oh and the 14 stam, which is a ton in vanilla.  While in pve you don't stack stam or truely target it as a stat, having it on your chest piece means you can more easily afford to wear no-stam items in other slots like rings or weapon.  
---
SO more +healing, more regen(by a lot) and more stam.  It is entire tier, maybe more better then robes of the exalted.  
---
*if you are deep disc, add 7.5 mp to robes of exalted, if deep holy add 0.5healing from the spirit talent, but not enough to make it even comparable to Truefaith.
---
This is the truth.
---
Exact same for our group, except opposite factions. We were all hyped to roll Alliance this time around, but now we're kind of floating back to "but.. muh nostalgia.."
---
The healer classes are really good pals, especially druid and paladin because of their multi role nature. You'll be able to benefit your buddies no matter what they do
---
Yea I'm not joining a guild
---
friends don't let friends play alliance.
---
"For the 'horse'!"
---
Jk, man I understand. You have 2 months to decide so plenty of time to research.
---
Don't bother using arcane shot just serpent sting and AA
---
r/cursedcomments
---
 
---
friends don't let friends play horde.
---
Yes I brought up 4 issues you're only focusing on one, poorly. There's still nothing of substance coming from you, still you haven't debated any of the talking points mentioned. Staring zones, layer hopping, resources/economy and world events, please try and provide some actual debate here. You're just trying to get the last word and "win" without having to actually defend your point that layering is the best way to recreate the classic experience.
---
Yeah all my replies are world pvp based.
---
I agree with hunters and locks, but druids? Not so sure.
---
I cant wait to spend time talking to all the other feral druids in my raid..... \*Cries\*
---
They did not tweak the dungeon damage. The people claiming this (falsely) are people who have been exposed to private servers that have damage values much higher and/or are neglecting the skill cap of the average player is much better now than it was in the past.
---
Lol like I said. Just because you say it doesn’t make it true. 
---
I can also say “you’re wrong. You’re wrong. Nope you’re wrong. Nothing you’re saying makes sense. Nope.”
---
\&gt;  They also never have a solution when I ask them how Blizzard would actually accomplish it. 
---
The solution is already there, its called The Burning Crusade.
---
Being the best PvP healer has got to come with a downside
---
Hunters use it too
---
Stance Dancing is not boring lol
---
You just don't drop them when you have to move around a lot.  Maybe like WF for the tank or something.
---
But level 40 isn't level 60. Grinding gold for your mount at 40 is still a pain in the ass. You wanna save up everything you can.
---
Amen dude
---
That's not the kind of fake casting you are thinking about.
---
Mage is definitely going to be on my plate, so playing it with them would be a lot of fun. Shammy healer could be a lot of fun though.
---
Idk what they want to roll, traditionally tank/dps is their vibe
---
Piece of shit.
---
I just noticed that, yeah around the time classic was announced i stopped shaving and its going great, too bad my stache game is pretty weak.
---
Well in that case you have no right to complain, it's a PvP server and you choose to broadcast your exact position hours at a time. It's well within your power to make it stop.
---
That is a good point, unfortunately we're playing horde and also Druid is about the only class I have no interest whatsoever in playing haha. Priest/shaman is definitely in the cards though
---
There should be a reddit bot that auto detects photos of screens. It would get a million upvotes.
---
Ah, the ol' stop your cast to bait the interrupt? Yeah, good luck with that and spell batching.
---
You are incorrect.

1. Video showing incorrect mob damage values in Private servers Vs Classic  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M)
---
2. Bluepost confirming Elite mob damage is correct in classic, and incorrect on Private servers.
---
Facts do not need your approval. You are wrong. Have a nice day.
---
I dunno, druids are pretty troublesome for mages. Frost Nova is almost pointless against them, none of your slows work on them, and they can heal. The only way you can win is by draining them of their mana while somehow keeping your own mana up and keeping them from dpsing you down.
---
You just don't drop them all every time...  If the group isn't going to be in the general area for a long time, then only drop necessary totems.
---
Lmao what are you planning to do then? Solo q BGs all day?
---
Dude, your account is only 13 days old. 
---
Join more subs.
---
On k3 it might be the same, but not on the others for sure.
---
Great debate dude, thanks
---
You're thinking of Eye of the Beast for the pre-bis trink. That's from the quest to kill Drakkisath in UBRS.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13968
---
You’re telling me. Imagine debating someone that says your opinion is wrong. Yikes.
---
Somewhat off-topic, but any idea where I could get all the maps (the ones that show up when you hit M, not the minimap)? Wowhead has them, of course, but they vary in resolution. Or is that how the originals are as well?
---
I've tried poking around using casc\_extract from simc, but was not able to find the necessary file paths.
---
I’m not sure if I misunderstand your question or not but do you own the game right now? If you don’t own any version of the game you will need to purchase it on top of the subscription fee.
---
Purge kills all of this. Warlocks get eaten by a warrior then.
---
I used them up until level 50's on my hunter
---
It is odd that they are all reacting with shock to the small green baby.  What about whatever is going on with that dude on the left?
---
Man that would be so cool. Balance be damned I want to play a cool mmorpg
---
Carrot on a stick is from the shimmering flats, I think Mallet is from Dustwallow
---
Classic will be a social experience just as vanilla!  I love seeing band taking part of stories like this!!!!
---
Gank lowbies
---
Why can't they complain though? I think everyone should be able to complain but shit that bothers them. I can tell you with absolute certainty people complained all the time about being ganked back in vanilla.
---
Nifty stopwatch is badlands good sir
---
Ele and enhancement are way more of a meme in raids than ret
---
Best advice, just pick whatever you enjoy playing and *stick with it.*
---
The game and how you play changes so much as you progress. Don't give up when it gets hard because you will get past it.
---
I'm going for highest rank I can get. I'm retired and I have been wanting wpvp to be great again. I hated arenas primarily because there was nobody my age to run with. Open world is much more of that mmorpg feel that I miss.
---
Fucking sweet
---
Huh that's indeed weird AF. Could it be that any hidden macro API would let you cancel the buff without triggering the GCD? I'm not sure, but it's weird that some videos it clearly triggers, and some others it doesn't.
---
Ret cannot do any real damage if it's being actively dispelled
---
ZF Mallet isn’t a quest, you kill an NPC in The Hinterlands, who drops a mallet that you have to take to another spot in The Hinterlands to a spot to turn it into the ZF mallet
---
\&gt;   naxx raid without frost resistance 
---
   
---
"It's so c-c-cold, I only wore shorts! can you guys hurry up and carry me through naxx so I can get back to Durotar where it's warm?"
---
Ah I was thinking it was a quest to run to the hinterlands, my bad.
---
Totally viable in 5 mans
---
Err, so you would play your first class for "a lot of time" which was "time wasted" even though it wasn't fun?  Again... this is Classic, not Retail.   People played Vanilla it because it was **fun to play** not because of "progression".
---
(And shall we talk about doing the same thing over and over again... that's the whole definition of the game at the cap...)
---
Pretty much
---
Hmmm. Can OP please link his main BFA armoury? Ty
---
&gt; Sorry you don't like world buffs, but they're a huge part of vanilla
---
No, they're a huge part of pirated servers, but not vanilla.  They weren't used in vanilla raiding.
---
Sorry, where am I wrong?
---
I said almost the same. 2-3 damage per swing doesn't matter. Especially in dungeons.
---
Private server dungeons are not significantly harder or different.
---
Nice try tho. Hey, by the way, remember the stone skin bug, that reduced mob damage on players? Was it possible that blizz was.. wrong? Oh no! You're taking this way too seriously, believing everything and talking about stuff you don't know enough about.
---
I guess so man. I always saw twinking as something to do for fun and that's it cause it requires minimal effort to set up and also very little skill to utilize in pvp. You gotta actually be a poop sock to try hard in twink brackets, especially 19 lol just my 2 cents tho, I'm not the nicest person
---
I was +40 and it scared me.
---
You lost me with that first sentence. 
---
I'm just saying back in vanilla I made the mistake of rerolling over and over because I would level a class to 20 only to find out I didn't really enjoy playing it. That was part of the reason why I never got to 60 during vanilla. 
---
It's best to find out what class you like best beforehand so you don't have to waste time levelling something you don't know if you'll like or not.
---
What do you mean? Orc and Tauren shoulderpads will be glorious.  
---
Tauren (Male) everything will be glorious.
---
Oof
---
Or some guy with no friends that wants to take all the gear and not wipe
---
2-3 damage does matter, pre level 60 2-3 damage can be anywhere from 5-50% difference in damage for some mobs. I get it, you're one of those braindeads that think Pservers are more accurate than blizzards exact replica Vanilla client, but instead you choose to believe that the Mangos core from 10+ years ago actually had it right. Bahahahaha.
---
wow i havent seen that greyed out party member graphic in so long, thankfully it doesnt seem like it will be a thing in classic
---
Paladins. I've never touched them because I have standards.
---
I can tell that’s bullshit, but ok buddy. Since you seem to know more than Blizzard about the stats of their own fucking game, you must be right. 
---
AV was a ghost town. They changed it. Deal with it.
---
Back in Vanilla I and my Warriors friends meet before the first Raids and discussed who gets which Tier Piece first. Then we made up a List and the one who was on the line got it for 1DKP and the rest passed for him. So we saved up all our DKP for off-specc pieces. 
---
Sadly the Raidlead introduced Min-Bids somewhat quickly.
---
Just be patient then, I'm sure you could snag an OEB or earthshaker after 2H warriors got epics.
---
My understanding is that you still need to own wow.
---
Yes sory
---
Nope, doesn't matter in dungeons. I didn't say anything about more accuracy, but that they were close enough to not matter.
---
Talk about braindead.
---
What am I, water-Jesus? this is an outrage!     
---
\#livingwage4water  /s
---
Enjoy your neckbeard. and i already have a guaranteed raid spot as the main tank soooooo.....
---
GO AROUND THE CORNER AND LOS THEM HOES.
---
Then if you aren't cut out to play in a progress guild then don't play in a progress guild?
---
Seriously, this can be summed up to, "If you want to get rewarded then work hard; if you don't want to work hard you can't get rewarded."
---
Not a chance
---
ok thank you
---
thanks
---
Me too, but multicore came in 8.1 fyi
---
And you have a high chance to monopolize cloth gear, which means you can curate each others' characters rather than gain nothing when a pugger nabs the loot.
---
I'm going to say no.
---
Nah, you won't get past the first two Molten Giants.
---
"close enough to not matter."
---
Except that it does matter. It matters a lot.
---
Correct vs Incorrect... hmmm i wonder what Blizzard wants to be
---
I’m pretty sure the offhand is pre-bis for casters, it’s a lot of spellpower.
---
And, even with a low skill floor, it has a high skill ceiling. You're automatically good enough to hang, but you won't get bored of the class due to simplicity.
---
You didn't play classic at launch. Maybe classic beta or vanilla but classic hasn't launched yet.
---
No changes
---
Do you have a source for that testing? I'd love to see what best duos.
---
The early game happens so fast and theres so much to do and so many people around, best experience in any game
---
Gonna pay for a Ventrillo server so I'm the MVP of some guild...... oh shit it's 2019
---
I will avoid it since it's not an efficient honor grind. I will do more when I feel geared and I want to do 2-4 hrs tops. If people are really trying to be strategic and win I'll like it.
---
This is what I did as a blood dk in wotlk. Juggernaut that WOULD kill somebody if not responded to but also hard as fuck to actually deal with.
---
About to be king of the neckbeards
---
This is so true. I always asked myself “why don’t I just play alliance...”
---
Would a druid have a better time as Horde or Alliance?  I want to play a druid but have no clue if I want to do Horde or Ally. (Don't care for the racial differences)
---
Raid for ganking gear and then use said gear to kill everyone
---
From a gameplay mechanic it was neat, but from a story and lore perspective shit started getting weird. *Everyone* became the chosen one at the start of the expansion.
---
&gt;Like Crown of the Earth in Teldrassil. "Go to Moonwell, click on this vial in your bag" - they grant 500-1100xp each, and you can do them with 5 people in the zone, or 5,000 in the zone.
---
The Crown of the Earth chain has a pre-quest involving killing Webwood spiders in a cave, which is going to take a while since you will be competing with every level 3 Night Elf.
---
Insignia of the Horde (or Alliance) will help once it's live, but in my experience it's only favorable if you get the drop. Otherwise it's 50/50 imo.
---
Also don't be afraid to feign an aimed shot to provoke an ice block.
---
I hope said class is warlock!
---
Why does something you don't want to do have to be retarded?  People are way too polarized now a days...
---
If you don't want to do something then don't do it.  Don't criticize the people that do it because they're out performing you.
---
Improved models are not what killed WoW
---
So you didn't like WoW, but kept playing it...  why would you do this?  Get outside, man.
---
I get the point you're making but I progression raided in vanilla and there most certainly were dps meters. It's not elitist neckbearding, everyone just cared about doing well because they wanted to beat the raid boss and not waste 39 other people's time.
---
Different guilds, different mindsets.
---
I'm sure you can find some common ground with the hunter pets.
---
I absolutely would, but I’m personally not tech savvy enough.
---
Yea... it's all my loot mate.
---
“Make it easy for retail player”
---
Imagine thinking vanilla dungeon is half as hard as m+ even with mob damage doubled.
---
I liked the game, but not most of the classes. Are you trolling?
---
All the sheep see the streamers playing horde and durp right on over.
---
I feel like leveraging water as a mage is like priests leveraging shields on non tanks.
---
Everyone is going to hate you for it.
---
I am a proud representative of the third head
---
Exactly! Well said.
---
Yeah, they are very much good enough. 
---
A warrior, at level 7, does about 5 dps, including battle shout. Maybe less. 
---
1.8 bonus dps from the gladius (the starting quest sword is 2 dps) is a BIG increase. .57 dps from lion's strength elixir is another big increase. all told, that's 47% more damage. You will not replace the gladius until you can farm large quantities of murloc foragers (level 10 mobs with a self heal that you cannot interrupt as you don't have an interrupt), for 8 torn murloc fins.
---
The shield, ignoring the tripling of your block value, is about 12% less damage taken, at level 7, though it scales off with level. You will not get it's equivalent until you can kill level 10 riverpar outrunners in quantity, to get 8 gnoll bandanas right before you leave elwynn for westfall. You will not replace it at all, as it's just as good as the shield you get from that quest. 
---
It's about 12% less damage taken, at level 7, for a human warrior (largely because human warriors do not get a mail chest piece in the entire 3 starting zones, so they are wearing grey mail or worse in the chest slot until they buy it or they go to loch modan). So compensating with a shield makes a lot of sense, as it's just more armor per silver than upgrading the leather tunic you have to a mail tunic. 
---
All in all, this kit will reduce the time to kill by a third and reduce the total damage taken to 60% of what it would be otherwise, and that ignores your block chance, which is probably another 2.5% damage reduction. 
---
It's a big big deal to add up all these little advantages. 
---
It's race specific. You look at your starting weapon proficiencies. If you can use a 2 handed weapon, get one. If you can't, get a 1 hander. Once you have done that, get alchemy and herbalism, then get 5-10 vials, then get your shield.
---
It's likely that as horde, your starting quest rewards will be different though. Maybe you get a shield at level 7-8 that is not a terrible 50 armor piece of trash, and maybe you get a chest piece before your third zone and level 14.
---
This I didn't play beta but for all I care layering is sharding just with or control
---
I just tried growing out a beard shortly after I turned 30 to see if it looked decent on me, and if I had the genes to grow a full, proper beard. Turns out, it works. I don't have shit on Soupasoka's though.
---
It was in the video that you've posted. Roflmao
---
And don't talk about ego bullshit, since you're messaging me just to shittalk.
---
Playing alliance would answer that for you pretty quick
---
Play the character you want to play as your main and roll an alt to play with friends.  From my experience, most friends want to come and play for a bit and then drop the game at level 20.  With others that can't play as much it's better to just play your main character and then go party up with an alt when they're online.
---
Hey that's right up my alley
---
Start a new job tomorrow had to shave mine ....
---
Search Kargoz on YouTube, make sure you’re watching the latest videos as there are several iterations
---
So you had fun until 20, but not beyond?  Was that wasted time, or time spent having fun?
---
Are \*you\* trolling?  What is the reason to play WoW?
---
Have fun. That's it. You can always do something else, play another class or the other faction.
---
Sharding works better from what I can tell. Which is scary. I have spent a lot more time on retail with sharding and experienced less shifts mid combat there than I did on the stress tests.
---
This is what you wrote to me in that DM
---
" Oh sorry, I thought you  were a girl. Why r u mad bro?  You should go to school and try to "learn a lot about" reading and  understandig what you've read today. Might help you later in life.
---
So I take it back. Don't want oral sex from a retarded, underaged boy.
---
I hereby apologize. 
---
Lol"
---
Imagine being that wrong and desperate that this is what you resort to
---
Your gf has been seeing me mate, and I’m gonna dump her before launch
---
The Blackfathom Depths' quest for the blue wand for priests mandatory and maybe casters if they want to take the time to run BFD lol.
---
Then call it vanilla.. I played 15 years ago the original wow.
---
Have game nights with my buddies, level together, run dungeons, keep up with professions, take our time on the journey to 60, and finally, heal some raids!
---
Ultimately it was wasted time because I never got to 60 as a result and missed out on many things.
---
When I started playing on a pserver “/p OOM, need to drink” was the first macro I made
---
Shoot that’s where I PvP’d before battlegrounds came out.
---
Was pretty sweet being that 60 that helped out my lowbie faction mates.
---
You have no chance without world buffs..... It's like a 50% dmg increase.
---
About to sell my house, beard is already in full effect. Possibly moving back in with the parents and quitting my job.
---
If you play on [the server where no streaming is allowed](https://redd.it/by3nd0), you can even win raid loot.
---
Ooga
---
wasn't that clear though given he asked "what race is better for horde mage" and the first thing you said was "orc is the best"
---
They were % based in vanilla too, so why would that matter?  Clearly they removed them so the buffs didn't trivialize the content.  
---
Just answer the question,
---
Would blizzard have changed the way they work in raids, if they were abused like they are on the pirated servers?
---
You know the answer, but you won't say it...
---
This is one thing I appreciate about M+, and what I appreciated about content like the timed Baron run in Vanilla, the timed run in Shattered Halls in BC, the timed run in Culling of Strat in WOTLK. You can't be garbage as a healer. You can't just overheal constantly, be absurdly inefficient, and then drink after each fight. 
---
All this said, this is why I'm looking forward to playing with folks I know - acting as a well-oiled machine the content should be able to move along quickly.
---
I'm cool with starting with #NoChanges, but eventually I would be cool with patches to balance/make things more interesting.
---
\#SomeChangesLater
---
No it’s been like this pretty much all the time. The only time I can remember (because I only hit cap in late tbc) that this wasn’t really the case was when I was playing premades in wotlk.
---
Has anyone done the actual math  on this at low and mid levels? I’m seeing a lot of mixed opinions on spell power Vs. Int/spirit
---
Thats why you get dartols rod to fake heal
---
What does each healer excel at in Classic?
---
How is endgame Enhancement Shaman? Elemental?
---
The most important thing about leveling is the time. The world record for 1-60 is 116 hours played. Normal players can put in over 200. Casual players can go over 400. The halfway point in terms of time comes somewhere between level 40 and 50.
---
What does this mean for you? It's a HUGE investment if time to level a character all the way, so it's really really important to find the class that you enjoy the most. But it also means that if you're already committed to hitting 60 on some character, relatively speaking it isn't a big time sink to level a lot of classes up to 10-20 to try them out.
---
Before playing I was interested in paladin, druid, warlock, rogue, mage, and hunter, in roughly that order. I got all to 10, and a few to 20, before I settled on druid for my main (and warlock as my main secondary).
---
So if you're torn between 3 or even 4 classes, try them all out. You want to know which one is your favorite before committing to the full slig to 60, and you can't really know until you've played more than one class. I was really stoked on playing paladin at first, but he ended up eternally logged out in the inn of a lvl 20 zone while my druid dinged 60.
---
I'm 30 with a great job. I am 100% going to roll a Rogue and murder people. Lowbies? Nah. I will murder equal level players who are still going to stand no chance against me because I've played Rogue for 15 years.
---
I don't have one now, but I have the entire week off work for the launch. I'm sure that following Sunday evening I'll be full on neckbeard.
---
See you there, man! I don't want to spend this entire game looking over my damn shoulder, either! Already bad enough that STV has those stealthed panthers.
---
You do have a point there, they can shift breaking all roots and slows so getting up close in cat form for example wouldn't be too hard.
---
The biggest wow streamer is alliance but ok
---
For the Horde!
---
Baaaaaaaaaa
---
Oh okay yeah. I bet bartering would work. Or holding onto it until people start making gold
---
Yup.
---
That OH is pretty much pre-his until AV Offhands are added.
---
Yes, you absolutely can heal as enhancement. Just keep some gear with Intel and spirit as you go and you'll be able to get in groups up to BRD. If you keep your healing gear up to date, you can just switch to that once  you go resto and you'll be healing 5 mans just fibe. 
---
I once healed Scholo as enhancement, but I don't recommend it, but it's possible. A good thing to keep in mind is in Classic, you play your class, not your spec.
---
I made a shaman leveling guide you're welcome to check out.
---
https://youtu.be/tI4Yllz_JZs
---
That’s idiotic in a few ways, but you do you, streamer killer
---
im going to shave my neck at launch and let it grow as i level.
---
Yeah they are annoying enough in live I can only imagine classic.
---
I don’t remember the other rogues from when I raided in vanilla. I just remember getting into an argument with our ret paladin who snagged up the Chromatically Tempered Sword because him and the guild leader were best buds. Half of the guild took my side, the other half took his. We disbanded soon after.
---
Bwahaha, yeah, right. A troll proves things. You haven't disproved anything I've said. Keep on trying. The video you've posted just underlined what I have said.
---
Take the D.
---
If it was an exploit like you think it is, blizzard would remove it, but they aren't. If you wanna parse 99 get world buffs
---
Gearing up in Classic, should you ever purchase gear from vendors/AH or can you get along just fine though quest rewards like you currently can in Retail?
---
If you got to 59 you got the most of of WoW.  If less with multiple characters, even moreso.  Don't let people who got addicted to the skinner box of gear tell you otherwise.  And I became one of those people:
---

---
Another streamer whiner to block.
---
My buddy is going to play a paladin, and we plan to play together pretty much always. 
---
**Question is: What class would go well with a paladin?**
---
 I am choosing between a priest, warlock, mage, and maybe warrior. What do you think of these pairings?  
---
I'm interested in how each class combination could benefit. We'll likely be taking things very slow, trying out as many dungeons as possible, and exploring the world. We could AOE grind, but it wouldn't be the focus!  Thanks!
---
thanks for this but its a bit wall of texty
---
*Malfurion would like to know your location*
---
Can't speak from experience, but having warstomp is really nice for sneaking a cheeky heal in.
---
Great. This is what I was fearing. Older raids were abandoned completely in favor of the latest. Got worse after BC. I’m even more excited for classic now.
---
We're all struggling with that! : )
---
As for addons, I'm not sure what will / won't have a functioning version when classic launches. There are websites cataloging what is working in the Beta, but I don't know their URLs off the top of my head.
---
My only strong recommendation is that you get familiar with an auction house (AH) addon early on. The most popular one around when I played was "Auctioneer," but nowadays the dominant AH addon might go by another name. Their main purpose is to give you information about your server's economy. The addon does this by scanning all current auctions for price data. Make it a habit to scan the AH every so often while you're in a capital city (where AHs are located), and you'll have a better sense of how valuable things are that you find while adventuring or make via professions.
---
Other popular types of addons focus on all sorts of things like customizing your UI, adjusting how specific ability/spell information is displayed, and simplifying inventory/equipment management. I've forgotten the names, unfortunatley. However, I suggest getting a decent feel for your character before diving too deep into addons. Once you've got the ball rolling on your class, feel free to tinker away--the options are limitless!
---
Priest also has a very high leveling rate.  They're extremely self-sustaining, but require upgrading wands while leveling.  Your talents start off with 20% wand damage and then move to spirit tap.  Bubble(Until Holy Fire or against casters), Mind Blast, SW:P (not necessary at all), Wand. Dead.  Repeat.  
---
It's really fun and other players don't expect your wand damage to be so high and consistent, plus fear, and healing.
---
&gt;They were % based in vanilla too, so why would that matter?  That is a non argument.  Clearly they removed them so the buffs didn't trivialize the content.   You know damn well that it wasn't because they didn't want people to go back and do old content.    Hell, blizz added Transmog just so people would do just that.
---
I mean, you've given nothing of substance to go off of, simply your opinion. So I will reply as such. I disagree.
---
&gt; Just answer the question. Nothing else matters. 
---
Okay. Yes they would have kept them in if people used them, that is why they were in, to be used. Not too difficult of a question really.
---
So, in traditional wow fashion, I'm "just gonna check out this game, see what it's about." You know, start with optimism. Then it will slowly consume my life,  as I stop bathing,  stop going to work,  stop seeing irl people, stop sleeping,  etc. Then one day I'll just happen to have a neckbeard. But weekday came first,  the neckbeard or the neckbeard behavior. The world may never know.
---
This. TL;DR
---
Make it pithy or don't make it at all.
---
Do the hounds hit that hard too? I heard they hit for 300 dmg its just the fire resist id need.
---
The main tank essentially needs to be the guild leader, or at least the raid leader. So you honestly have to have excellent social skills.
---
Most consumables will basically be given to you by the guild (in general, that's at least how it worked for me), but you'll be expected to run scholo/dire maul/brd a shit ton, NEVER miss a raid, have practically pre raid bis, and overall be super helpful to everyone.
---
You're going to want mining/BS if you want to be the guild BS. Otherwise it doesn't matter really. Get a gathering/crafting.
---
Just answer the question. Nothing else matters.
---
Would blizzard have changed the way the wold buffs work in raids, if they were abused like they are on the pirated servers?
---
* What the game wants them to do.
---
Enhancement does not do enough damage and Elemental has the problem that there is no real way to reduce nature resistance from bosses (aside from thunderfury, but even that is not enough).
---
Nah. I like that they are basically buffs that you cast once every 2-4 pulls. 
---
Long enough you dont refresh them mid combat, short enough that it requures thinking/remembering.
---
Arent there already really strong short buffs pallies get. Blessing of prot, and maybe hands? I forgot if hands are in classic
---
I have Yaht. Thanks for sharing this video!
---
The “probably poor and uneducated” part rubbed me the wrong way.
---
See, now I know you are an intellectually dishonest turd.
---
Priests, Pally and Shaman are pretty good healers
---
Enhancement is heavily reliant on Windfury procs but is very strong (PvP wise), the struggle will be getting gear as they aren't a viable spec for PvE, and is one of the worst PvE dps classes.
---
Elemental is very strong in PvP, but is also not viable in PvE and raid situations based on lack of mana efficiency/sustainability
---
Blizzard has always made an emphasis on making their games very accessible, and always include Apple compatibility for games. I'm absolutely certain you'll be able to play on a Mac :)
---
Probably Shaman.  I played one on Nost and was just totally bored at level 45.  I had to constantly drink and if I wasn't drinking I was killing things so slowly and eating.  I probably should have been kiting with frost shock and a 2h, but that's try hard.
---
Same deal with Warriors and Paladins.  They kill things so slowly and if they're doing it fast they're kiting or doing whatever the paladin does.
---
The nu-Rogue aesthetics are absolute trash and the strategic gameplay is completely dumbed down and pruned, with massively reduced utility in the kit. It's another generic, homogenized vehicle for a dps rotation now.
---
Wouldn't recommend druid in general, but obviously you have the choice to play whatever class you like, I'd go Alliance as you will be competing with less druids/shamans for gear if healing.
---
Play what you want because in 6months, those guys and tourists who picked warrior, rogue, mage because they top the charts will quit...  because they followed the wants of groupthink instead of choosing the class they enjoy.  Memespecs are for tryhards, keep that in mind
---
Going to start off with a Warlock like I did back in the day. Take my time, have fun and make friends. No pressure to rush to 60. Aiming to get Ench + Tailoring to max with all recipes.
---
Can speak from experience: War stomp is a nice pvp boost. For example you can cast a root in its duration. Or stun and travel form to get away, etc.
---
5% more life aint bad either. 
---
Shadowmeld is not as important, since you have prowl in cat anyway.
---
Pve wise it does not really matter.
---
I mean, you've given me nothing to go off of. You just keep asserting that you are correct. Try to come up with a better argument in favor and you'll probably have more substantial conversations.
---
Also insults totally prove you right, nice one.
---
They mentioned this in a blue post and said that they will be keeping the inconsistency in Classic, just like it was in Vanilla.
---
Outrage?
---
Yeah I can't imagine fake casting while I'm spamming a 1.5s Flash of light over and over and over.
---
Persist and play what you want.  Don't choose your class based on perceived difficulty.  They're all easy to play once you understand how the game works.  But definitely persist at playing the game.  It gets more rewarding as time goes on.
---
That would be a ToS violation, tho
---
Easiest way would be to make your own private server, ti's really not that hard it doesn't require any skill or knowledge  just google it.
---
Who hurt you
---
"Yeah I know"
---
If you join a group in another layer while fighting something you do get layered, I’ve tested it
---
Would it?
---
As a druid, this is what I'll be doing now.  Thanks.
---
Those few people that go through first are all the popular streamers.
---
Most of the streamers are going alliance. They will bring a lot of people with them.
---
Casuals will also favor alliance as a lot of people just default to human.
---
Only the definition of exploit, but sure kiddo.
---
I think this meme would be better if the right read scarlet chadsader.
---
Some skills are low priority and should wait until higher priority skills are purchased, but after 60 and your 60% mount you should have all the buyables.
---
You can equip multiple ranks of spells, and in many cases you'll not want only the highest rank equipped.  I think I had 6 or 7 ranks of healing touch on my bar for healing as a druid.  Low rank spells have reduced spellpower coefficients at 60, so spamming rank 1 whatever with high spellpower isn't going to be effective, although it can be a mana efficient tool for topping people off.
---
Usually you use a lower rank with the full spellpower coefficient to be more mana efficient and swap to the highest rank when you need burst healing.  I'm not sure how DPS works, I think there are a few cases where they use the penultimate rank for efficiency but generally use the highest rank they have.
---
She’s gonna feral/resto hybrid anyways and doesn’t like the cattle
---
&gt; No, they're a huge part of pirated servers, but not vanilla. They weren't used in vanilla raiding.
---
Oh look, it's a [video of vanilla raiders using world buffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A).
---
Stop trying to change the balance of vanilla based on your own personal preferences.
---
Most people didn't use world buffs in vanilla because they weren't necessary and there was no 'raid log' online ego contest for people to compete on meters.  If you want to introduce parsing and speed runs into your Classic experience, you're just going to have to deal with the fact that vanilla wasn't balanced for that.
---
I know the answer, its not like Blizzard is ignorant of how they are on private servers, they have the option to change them right now and they aren't
---
You need to prove that. The only "proof" you've provided is that they removed them in the next expansion. Does that mean hunter mana and ammo was an exploit in wrath? Does that mean old talent trees were an exploit in wrath/cata? It's a game that is constantly changing no shit things get removed.
---
Paladin or priest with a Warrior 100% easy to find  a group
---
Good advice!! Thanks man
---
Hunter, has a plethora of rpg elements and a fun rotation in vanilla.
---
I see why the rare pet features were removed, but they were a fun and relevant thing to *hunt* for. Also would have been nice to keep Lupos around to mitigate the damage drop off with that shadow damage 
---
Still have the great bow quest though, those solo demon fights are fondly remembered for a reason.
---
Hopefully the player saturation will be a bit lower this time and I'll have less in-class competition for raid day and an easier time puging.
---
Hoping to farm enough Doomshot to win meter bets like a friend of mine used to do. It's too much of a meme to use consistently, but keeping a stack around should be doable.
---
The themes and mechanics are both significant appeals for me.
---
Salty losers baaaaaaaaa for me !! 👌🏻🤡
---
Baaaaaa
---
Hmmm. Maybe I should play a few toons on a private server to figure it out?
---
There is a lot going on here.  Comes off as butt hurt about something.
---
Because spending two hours to save 30 minutes is a massive waste of time.
---
Okay great! That gives me a solid base to go off of! Youre the man!
---
A lot of the time they will CC you and I always think "Well that's one CC not hitting someone who can actually kill them"
---
Cheers! Thanks man
---
Lol who makes this stupid shit
---
I do not own any version of the game I was asking if I could get away with just purchasing the vanilla copy instead of buying all the expansions. Just considering my cheapest route to classic.
---
Go look up exploit.  ffs
---
Alliance are better at following orders and working as a team. Horde have better individual players with more skill. This is why Horde dominate smaller bgs and small world pvp and Ally win AV (along with map advantages) and usually win in large scald world pvp. Just my experience from playing since 05.
---
Yes, they hit the same, but faster.
---
You don't know if they have or haven't.  It's not the same as vanilla either, because you have two factions vehemently opposed to change.  The no change fanatics, which are mostly just morons, and the pirated server fanatics, which just want ez mode.
---
I think my first custom keybind in vanilla as a healer was one for drinking, and always hit the drink button any time we got out of combat.
---
2h Axe and mace* 
---
 -pretty sure he can equip staffs from lvl 1. 
---
Some of them got better dps than their equivalents level 2h maces/axes. Far past lvl 20 
---
Not that you didn’t answer his question about the 2h mace 
---
-just sayin 2h action is still doable.. with a stick..
---
The buying of gold, yes.
---
The paying someone to corpse camp someone? No.
---
Premade AV? I remember an addon that made this possible, but you can't group queue normally, right?
---
If WoW Classic takes off and gets very popular then there's no rule that servers ***must*** lose population. WoW launch first month to 100,000 players and ended vanilla at 7.5 million players, quite a lot of growth and lots of new servers opening! BC and WOTLK maintained similar growth, although not as steep. The surge and decline of expansion population is more of a modern-WoW issue, which may or may not affect Classic WoW but that's anyone's guess.
---
He thinks that Bliz put world buffs in as a reward for completing a raid, but somehow didn't realize that those raiders would then use that world buff in another raid.
---
AND
---
He thinks that anything Bliz didn't explicitly intend is an exploit.
---
But really that's just a cover for the truth: that he wants to make a balance change to vanilla and hide behind the word "exploit".
---
You might be hopeless, sorry dude I tried to get you there. Good luck on your crusade.
---
How so? People used to put bounties on players all the time in Trade chat on PvP servers.
---
You're friends made the correct choice.
---
Ohh please, that's called cherry picking kiddo.
---
You've asked a google'able question and act like its new.  Don't do that.
---
Yes, it does. I actually saw this happen for savory delight on cdew's stream.
---
I will say, this is what makes classic great.  it actually creates an emotional response.  havent seen anything like that in retail in a long time.
---
That crazy burst damage though.
---
Fucking seriously. I leveled up a 19 Horde Twink and I’m literally dumbfounded at how stupid these Horde Twinks are. Every single one of them fighting mid. I would’ve expected twinks to be a lot better at the game
---
You can, but none of that progress will be saved. It won't be that big of a deal if you wait until Classic releases in August - even if you get 3-4 classes to level 20 before deciding on a single one, that's not going to put you too far behind the pack, because a lot of people are going to be coming to the game late, or just taking their time like you. But if you want to keep up with your friends, and you know they won't be taking the time to try out several classes before moving on, then it might be a good idea to try things out on a private server.
---
OP seems mad.
---
A sign from God indeed
---
I'm actually enjoying bfa but shhhh. Secret ;)
---
Go read the definition kiddo.  L2read
---
What a lovely photograph
---
How easy is it to switch from one spec to another? Can I go from holy pally to prot just like retail or does str not convert into int on my gear and character stats?
---
I always thought Whirlwind looked like a net or wind sock of some kind, and only recently realized it is a sword spinning around. It makes a lot more since now.
---
Because you know that one day you will be the decked out neckbeard repeatedly ganking people.
---
Nonono, don't gank him. Pay people to pretend to be his fanbois and bring him to raids, make him pay the guild money (that he gets from his real fanboys) and starve him for gear, meaning that he doesn't get any of the loot, ever. 
---
Pay people to kill his questgivers/vendors/trainers.
---
No other ideas atm.
---
&gt;Playing optimally shouldn't involve not playing.
---
Idk man I thought the Garrisons were a smash hit
---
Good you deserve to be alone alliance scum!
---
Absolute cringe.
---
as a shadow priest, it did suck to be bascially be at half mana after buffing.  still, nochanges
---
Yeah I really want to keep up with my friends! Im looking forward to the social aspect for sure
---
Shirtless nightelf with the kilt and warglaivr vs the red dragon in... Stv?
---
AV sucks no matter what version it is. At least with 1.12 you don’t have to endure the garbage for very long. 
---
Happy as shit it’s not one of the earlier iterations.
---
I agree 1.12 AV is bad, but acting like the earlier versions of AV were better is retarded. 
---
That BG has been shit from start to finish.
---
Actually I plan to play a dwarf priest.  My plan is to make friends and get groups as a healer, and try to build a group of friends.  Those who prove themselves in group content will get a guild invite offer.
---
Perhaps you should do what you like to do and find likeminded individuals that way and not make people question your thought process.
---
Let us be honest.  Did we watch them much past Saturday evening?  Seems like all the big streamers ditched this weekend because testing was actually needed instead of just playing.
---
I've been trying out all classes on a pserver, and so far have fallen in love with druids. Heal and playstyle is most unique! 
---
You bring up a great point on going ally. Thank you. :)
---
Honestly, that sounds like shitty raid leadership more than the guy's fault. Although I imagine there were pressure from the ranks to move him up that was hard to give into, so I do understand that it's probably hard being a good raid leader in a guild full of people who have no idea of why they're wiping or not.
---
But still, if you can't put your foot down when people want to replace a tank who dodges all but 1 knockback and manages to keep agro, when can you put your foot down?
---
Go in like we all did! Blind AF and make characters that look cool.
---
0/10
---
He isnt being serious. Or at least he is somewhat trolling
---
&gt;virgin beta meme spec complainer vs
---
&gt;alpha chad big bulge shitstomping meta spec warrior
---
That shit just takes me out of the game. That and all the NPCs in the starting area are in this badass looking gear. Like why the hell am I even here?
---
You’ll need to buy bfa, it includes all expansions.
---
1 - Time Commitment - Attend all raids. Without your the raid doesn't happen generally. If they can go without you they will probably give main tank status to someone else. Most guild will probably run content 2x a week. Maybe some hard core guild 3x a week until its on farm status and gets reduced to either 1x or 2x a week.
---
2 - Raid Prep - Really depends on the type of guild to run with. Hardcore guilds will want full consumables. Casual guilds wont give a fuck. I was an OT in Vanilla and none of us used consumables and we cleared things just fine. It just takes a bit longer.  How many Hrs depends on you. whether you are gathering the mats for just farming gold to buy the consumables.  
---
3 - Competitive - In my experience, very. Most guild by the time they are formed already has a designated Main tank. its usually the GM or someone who knows the GM. that being said, if you join a guild and show you have far superior knowledge on **all** fights and the skill to match it, they might give the spot to you. Your best chance is to make your own guild (which comes with alot of work), being at a guilds conception or joining a guild who kinda sucks and lead them to victory.
---
4 - Loot Distribution - two factors here. Loot distribution system and your Commitment . Loot council will get you geared up faster than DKP. **However** if you are new or don't show commitment to guild (raid attendance and being on non-raid nights to help people) then you will probably get gear slower cause the guild might think you will flake and join a better guild once geared.
---
5 - Tips - Know all the fights. Help people gear up on non raid nights. Ask yourself why you want to be a tank in the first place. Is it just for Thunderfury or do you actually enjoy tanking.
---
6 - Professions - Mining will help if you want Thunderfury. Engineering with help with AoE tanking thanks to grenades. Herb/Alch for consumables. Blacksmithing, it will help make you gear to get ready for raid but wont do you much good once you are raid geared. It also doesn't make a lot of money unless you get the lion heart helm recipe.  
---
Hope this helps dude.
---
To get good enough to become a streamer ;)
---
The buying gold part, yes. I also don't think anyone would take a 1 hour contract knowing a streamer can mobilize fanboys after the first 2 deaths. I also don't imagine you'll actually want to go thru paying sometime to kill another player as opposed to just killing them yourself, or mobilizing a group to assist you in killing their team.
---
I think if you want to offer a kill bounty for a one timer for any player, streamer or your good friend, should be fine. It fits into the RP narrative for sure. It's also really not detrimental to anything. If they're playing on a PvP server, they're likely prepared to die. They will make a dramatic yell, have a chuckle, talk about pogs or something, then get on with their day.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
I was watching Snutz stream yesterday and it looked like 
---
/dismount 
---
/cast spell
---
Worked fine, this was news to me and must be to do with the new client being used
---
Oh yep, just buy vanilla and you’re good to go.
---
Granted it’s anecdotal, but this might be a good analysis.
---
Every good hybrid class player will have at least one set of gear for healing and extra sets for their favorite DPS builds.  Spec/class/etc. don't really change that, as soon as you can spare the bag/bank space start holding onto gear for your off-spec.
---
You'll be able to heal 5 mans without a healing spec, but after the 20's it becomes hard to heal without a decent mana pool.  By 60 you should have a basic healing set already (really any casting gear covers it), and that will let you heal 5 mans well enough to get better resto gear.
---
I did it in beta twice so far just to test it out, a bit slower for sure, but it is enjoyable.
---
I'm not going to be sitting around much in classic unless its in a RL chair so this doesn't bother me the slightest.
---
The Bindings won't even drop until Phase 3.
---
I assumed he meant the Lightforge gear.  But I guess his description would actually apply to Lawbringer or Lightforge lol.
---
I know, right. Hybrid melee in pvp is the dream!
---
I agree with this so much.
---
That's against tos. It's considered targeted harassment griefing. Targeting someone intentionally to ruin their experience.
---
:(
---
Lol I got a good chuckle from this
---
I found it the opposite.
---
I played Alliance originally on both Blackrock as a main server to raid and stuff, and played with friends on Kilrogg.
---
I would say on AV, it was about a 60% Horde winrate, and on smaller BGs, unless I go in with a premade, it was closer to 80% Horde winrate. 
---
I never made it to GM, but I did get to Marshal on my Blackrock, character, and LtC on Kilrogg.
---
For following orders in AV, I find it is not so much as better at 'orders', but the majority of people following the first group out the gate.
---
 - No this is a perfect copy of 1.12 as it existed in vanilla.    
---
 - Player damage, mitigation, and healing did increase substantially between 1.2 (Dec 2004) and 1.12 (Aug 2006) however. Including a lot of bug fixes.    
---
 - A lot of people leveled before their respective "class buff" patch, which incrementally power buffed every class in the game.    
---
 - There's no real point debating it. They don't have a copy of anything before 1.12.   
---
TL;DR: A little yes. But there's nothing that can be done. This is what 1.12 looked like in August 2006.
---
Does it matter? You can't get the bindings until BWL release also.
---
true, I cringe when I see people talking about meta in vanilla.

Classic WoW will have more players than BFA. Then Blizzard will know they fucked up somewhere along the line.

4 to 6 warlocks will be the average

---
If you all queue at the same time the chance of getting in the same BG together is pretty high, especially if the others are full
---
The buying gold part is the most important part.  You can't farm gold as a shammy.
---
This sub's style is terrible.  I had to disable it ages ago.  It's literally the only sub I've done this on.
---
Whole different ballgame.
---
1) You'll need separate gear sets.  Stats won't convert
---
2) You'll have to visit a trainer and pay the fine.  Starts out somewhat cheap but gets expensive as you go.  Caps out at 50g.  If you go a while without respeccing, the cost starts to come back down.
---
3) Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think you may need to relearn any ranks of talented spells? I forget if we had to pay for those every time.
---
&gt; They sure as fuck weren't exploited by collecting all of them.
---
Ah, so clearly the devs intended for a raid to kill Ony to get Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer because it would be fine for them to take *that* buff into their next raid... but it's an exploit to take too many buffs?
---
Or are you actually saying that the devs explicitly made a world buff that rewarded raiders and didn't think the raiders would use it in a raid?
---
I guess it comes from being a warrior. If I can outlast the stun I can probably kill the rogue, but honestly, it's kind of shit cause they'll come at you when you're low and there's not much you can do. Unless you happen to have a potion and/or retaliation, that's always fun. And mages and hunters just suck so much ass to deal with.  I've been running a paladin recently on a server, and it's a lot more fun to deal with wpvp when actually have tools to deal with it.
---
This is all a longwinded way of saying that I suspect you play a class that has a fairly wide toolbox.
---
Using an addon to utilize features within the game is not against the EULA.
---
I can see why it never got it
---
OPs user name checks out
---
I think you missed the point on how layering ruins the vanilla experience
---
Define exploit.
---
ya id like to think im not part of that group but...
---
And what do we do with  w̶i̶t̶c̶h̶e̶s̶  Thrall??
---
Vendors are not really worth it. Maybe aside from 1-2 limited supply green ranged weapons for hunter, but overall the vendor stuff is garbage.
---
AH is a bit trickier to answer. Definitly get a wand ealry on as priest. Less important on mage/warlock but still a nice addition.
---
It also depends on your playstyle. Are you running dungeon with their accompanying quests? probalby not gonna find an upgrade.
---
Are you saving up for your mount? etc,etc...
---
everything is easier if you just accept it :D
---
Headed to OP's mom's house to slay.
---
I mean, the killing of streamers is a community effort.
---
You have to go to the class trainer to switch specs. There is no dual spec.
---
 There is an escalating cost with a max cost of 50g. Remember that unlike retail 50g is a decent amount of currency. 
---
Stats do not convert.
---
Multi shot is physical damage based off your weapon, arcane shot is spell damage at a fixed rate. It typically has a poor mana to damage ratio too.
---
Don't see any lag at least :p
---
I will say that I enjoy some good wpvp around instances - they usually have a group, and so do you, roughly equal levels, it's good fun. But random open world questing or herbing turning into ganks is just annoying to me.
---
This man truly does make quality content.  Really hope he takes over the Classic Scene on release.
---
Unless you're arbitrarily targeting someone and convincing others to attack them via both factions. then it is targeted harassment and against the tos. 
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/20226
---
Simple pvp corpse camping is fine. If you however use a group of allies to track allies for harassment that is against tos as well.
---
It depends on you. Lots of people don't buy stuff from the AH. Gold is harder to come by at lower levels. 
---
Personally I like to almost twink out a toon while leveling it. But you can't totally get to 60 with quest &amp; dungeon gear.
---
Nope. Giving kings/salv to horde was allowed in Vanilla, and is allowed in Classic. 
---
You seem to think "exploit" means anything that you don't like. You also seem to be imagining rules that don't exist, and have never existed. Very strange! 
---
But I guess not that strange. Due to the Dunning Kruger effect, the people who understand the least about Vanilla are the same people who think they know the most. That certainly seems to describe you.
---
lmao
---
theres nothing unhealthy about it, if anything it gives people a reason to level alts and get back into the world/economy while their main sits offline
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
I wont. Try to have fun while youre wasting your time.
---
100%
---
I personally think it would be better if there was a bit of humour in there.
---
Wasn’t there a demographic study a while back showing the types of people and their traits that rolled a certain faction.
---
Warrior. Specifically Human Warrior. Could not think of anything more boring.
---
You really can't go wrong with any of them.  Paladin has something that plays well with everyone.  The only way it wouldn't is if you go priest and you both wanna heal (outside of raids).  With the clothies you'll love having blessing of wisdom and a melee buddy keeping most of the aggro.  With a warrior you can tank and he can heal and you'll have zero trouble filling out dungeon groups.
---
&gt; In video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.
---
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_exploit)
---
So to go back to my first question:  Are you claiming that the devs added a world buff as a reward for raiders completing a raid and that using this world buff in a raid is "not intended by the game's designers"?  Because that's the only way that using Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer is an exploit.
---
Or are you claiming that getting more than one world buff and using them in a raid is "not intended by the game's designers"?
---
Your argument isn't very solid here, so I'm trying to pin it down.
---
I don't think they need to use allies to track locations. They stream their location. I'm very interested to see how the whole thing goes down.
---
Are you actually retarded?
---
It's an aq40 trinket
---
Yeah, Webwood Venom is the only real chokepoint in the route. Took me 6 minutes last stress test, and I've got Judgement by then, so tagging's a fair bit easier.
---
But the 5,000xp from the chain is 100% worth the time spent killing those spiders.
---
My main goal is to clear all raid content while it's still "current".
---
My nonsense goal is to fill a quiver with Doomshot.
---
Convince my friends to play Horde, rather then Alliance because they have the 'pretty' race.
---
I played a Warlock on Alliance, so now I want to play Horde for the other side of the story, and also because I've grown to love RestoShaman once Alliance was able to use them.
---
Or just let stream snipers do it for free as thats how they get their joys so how
---
Guy on the left is regretting that 4th tab of acid
---
Meh cause sometimes its just fun to have a big old brawl in the middle of the map. Its level 19 pvp. Unless you were in a twink vs twink premade match than its all about fun.
---
Cant wait to make my 19 twink priest and 29 twink rogue.
---
Is frost going to be the go-to leveling spec? I heard people saying fire would be better outside of aoe farming which I don't think most people will do.
---
It still will be considered targeted harassment. If you continue to do it they'll take action. Streamers are free advertising for their game.
---
Shamans wear mail and would only compete with you over the same gear that paladins would also be gunning for (trinkets, rings, necks, cloaks).  That said, I'd still say alliance if you're gonna be PVE focused.  Palading blessings are great, and alliance cities are a bit better.
---
PVP server (mostly speculation) you'll probably see more serious folks about it on horde side.
---
Guess I should have added an /s ?
---
Cross-faction collusion is no longer against the EULA.
---
And I still don't see how you'll turn using an addon into a bannable offense. Blizzard has never once banned someone for using or developing an addon.
---
&gt; Get ... comfortable keybinds.
---
This is important. WoW allows you to rebind virtually anything. The sooner your keyboard-hand is able to fire off your most important/frequent abilities, the better. Save your mouse hand for targeting, camera positioning, and movement (right+left mouse buttons make you run forward).
---
&gt; Get a Quest addon
---
These are certainly useful, but a large part of the fun in questing is engaging with the quest text. It usually gives you a location/direction and an NPC/monster/object to search for, but sometimes the objective is tricky to figure out. If you're ever stumped, there are several online databases you can refer to for quests. An addon takes most of the thinking out of questing, which I think will make the experience feel like more or of a chore or grind than an adventure.
---
Me 15years ago southshores under attack *bullshit no1s here* 4 rogues come out of stealth *cries for mom*
---
We need a new plague.
---
It's fine. You need to make sure you're adding in grinding and not just questing. Find zones which don't get as much traffic and hit the routes for mining. 
---
Also 100% find an engineering leveling guide. You don't want to waste precious ore on recipes. 
---
Personally I will take mining /skinning and not start engineering until closer to 30. You don't really do a lot of PvP until that level anyways. The extra G from skinning can help push you over the bump to level up engineering if you need it.
---
People that buy gold are way worse than steamers. Maybe we should camp you OP?
---
Depends on what you do with the addon.
---
An exploit (known as "exploitive activity" by Blizzard) is a method of playing the game in a way not intended by the game developers to gain an advantage over other players. As with all massively multiplayer online games, World of Warcraft has its share of players who exploit and cheat.

Unfortunately blizzard has only addressed damage (\*not dps\*) of a few elite mobs/bosses, and not responded more broadly to the  elite dps damage question.  There is a scarcity of usable data from classic or early pre-2.3 bc as well - one might parse out rough damage per hit estimate, but who knows what the attack speed is vs was.  (most postersare confusing damage with dps - individual damage per hit may or may not be right for all mobs, but no one has any idea if attack speed is right.  )
---
I know blizzard has that 1.12 server and everything, and at this point the whole topic invites replies like the ones you see below essentially insulting people who ask questions or doubt blizzard, but who are you going to believe - blizzard or  your lying mind?  Remember the people insulting those who doubt the elite mob dps is identical have no more evidence than  you do.
---
I will also note that many people report outdoor questing feeling right (tuning) but dungeons being too easy.  This is not a false memory pattern anyone predicted or would be  likely to predict.
---
I am a Rshaman, so I don't have a choice.  How else can I compete with the economies being totally fucked by the Dire maul farming?
---
Pve: great damage, health stones, soul stones, etc.
---
They also have SM/Ruin as probably the most versatile specc in classic ( raiding, farming, pvp - while not the best spec for each it is still really viable)
---
On the downside: they are somewhat required to prepare for anything be it pvp or pve by farming a lot of soul shards.
---
pvp is vastly different on ally and horde side. as an alliance warlock you face plenty undeads + shamans that can purge/grounding/ interrupt you. 
---
As a horde warlock paladins can cleanse everything but your curse so a lot of potential pressure gets lost. freedom, sacrifice and protection are great support spells ... if you get them.
---
My fazit: While Paladins have great support they require more cordination so horde is overall more annoying to play against. 
---
In things change howeber: Blessing of salvation is massive on warlock, since he has no other threat reduce. If you are horde, not only does the totem has 10% less agro reduce, you are also less likely to get it, because it competes against windfury.
---
Right and left mouse together will also make you run forward, which can be useful when hitting other keybinds.
---
No one has ever been banned for using world buffs, no one will ever be banned for using world buffs. If its an exploit they'll remove it.
---
I love the idea of Shaman, but after reading about the totem quests and then having to learn ALL of those totems and figure out the nuances of each...sounds too complicated for my retarded ass.
---
To you Shaman players, I salute you.
---
There are already addons for what you consider targeted harassment. Ignoring chat, trades, groups, and auctions of a player. And the lists can be shared across guilds or even an entire faction using the hidden addon chat channels.
---
not good. It doesn't come in on the sides well enough. There's some hair there but it's patchy.
---
They go oom trying to keep up with the mages they have to cut themselves to make themselves feel better.
---
And that isn't stopping them from progressing in the game.
---
a handful of mobs and a boss or two? have been confirmed on damage per hit, nothing more.
---
It’s truly amazing when you see a million people together for the sheer numbers. Somehow we all coexist with one another in relative peace.
---
Are you saying that [Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Rallying_Cry_of_the_Dragonslayer) (a world buff given to raiders as a reward for raiding) was not intended to be used by raiders in a raid?
---
Because that's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  "Here you go raider, good job in that raid.  Take this buff for being a good raider.  Oh, but don't use it in a raid, because that would be an exploit that we never intended."
---
Rolling RP to enjoy myself and avoid streamers. I recommend it to anyone who wants to truly take it easy this time around
---
Herbalism/mining
---
Play the action house
---
SM live runs for orbs
---
Find a friend or 2 to do DM: east jump runs, bonus if you have an enchanter and miner
---
Same so i made new friends #Shaman
---
They might remove it, and they might just leave it in, because classic is little more than a desperate hail mary to get people back into retail to buy more pets and shit.  They don't actually give a fuck about the project beyond that.
---
Neither is corpse camping, which Blizzard never interferes with.
---
This addon just combines all of those into a convenient, inescapable platform.
---
Just don't be officer deciding over loot - endless bickering
---
Which server did you play on and at what point was your guild able to actually stack buffs?
---
I can see that being possible on a nearly dead server, but at the time most servers weren't dead/dying; medium to high pop servers the vast majority of guilds wouldn't be able to abuse this even if they wanted.  
---
Only the guild that was already pushing hard from the get go can truly use them, and I honestly don't see the big deal anyway.... that guild is going to clear everything in the game quickly regardless of having world buffs or not.
---
Lol bruh you can't just make up facts 💯💯 classic Reddit poster
---
The tanks will just reserve all the orbs, so you will never get one.
---
Weak stache gamers rise up!
---
Glad this is the top comment
---
Yes. Because that is pvp. HOWEVER. IF YOU READ THE BLUE POST. IT SAYS THAT TARGETED HARASSMENT IS AGAINST THE TOS AND ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN. if you continuously grief someone they WILL intercept it.
---
If you can't beat them, join them.
---
Perhaps we as a community should have bounties for people like you.
---
This is also a retail problem lol
---
It was just a quote from
---
The Office bro.
---
Same issue. Couldn't do it.
---
I don't think it will work as a Rshaman.  If it does, it would be much slower than the others.
---
Perhaps, but you couldn't handle me.
---
OP, will you be making a guide for 40-60? This is a great guide, and I'm really interested.
---
That bad priest is very efficient. Buffing my group requires me drinking before buffing the last member and is starting less than full mana.  It’s a dungeon and I’m sorry but I don’t buff dps. They shouldn’t be taking direct damage. They honestly do not need it. And if I am dps and I don’t get the buff I could care less.
---
the most important thing a healer needs to learn is when not heal.
---
tank runs forward while your OOM? well, there's gonna be a repair bill. he does it again? sorry, I'm all out of resurrections for today. same goes for DPS who doesn't let the tank build aggro, or anyone who is just... *fucking obnoxious*.
---
not healing people is a difficult job, but someone's gotta do it.
---
Then sit around and cry about it.
---
I like out-of-the-box thinking and trying new things.  I experiment around too and like to see what works.  Plenty of people will tell you why you are wrong without having even tried your build.
---
That said, taking + dodge over  imp. gouge in combat is a singular error imo.  a 5.5 second gouge is the difference between restealthing and not.
---
How old are you?
---
Is there a list anywhere for specifically 2h fury ?? Trying to figure out which pieces are 100% best because I obviously wont need as much hit as a dw fury.
---
It depends on how long you are raiding, which raid it is, and how good the guild is in general.  
---
If you are just joining a casual raiding guild that might raid 1-2 days a week for 2.5-3 hours each day, then you would likely need around 30.  
---
If the raids potentially last closer to 4-5 hours, then you might want to consider 50-60.  I think there are just too many variables to give you some set amount that fits all situations.
---
Nope. There's no measure to what is acceptable PVP. Blizzard's EULA specifically states that they never consider any PVP as harassment and will not intervene.
---
And you can't force a player to communicate, group, trade with, or buy auctions from another player.
---
Dps classes typically don’t get health stones.
---
Planning on going a Ret/Holy hybrid Paladin, is the instant crit heal talent in the Holy tree worth picking up? It’s a 2 minute CD which isn’t bad and I know it works well with the illumination talent but wondering how vital it is overall. I plan on doing fairly casual PvE and PvP so don’t know if repentance is better to take overall or not. Don’t want to be respecing for just 1 talent and my understanding is this hybrid works decent for all content just wondering which talent would be better overall.
---
Also wondering about professions. I was planning on doing BS/Mining for a while, maybe even until I can make some cool stuff like Arcanite Champion/Ripper or even Hand of Rag (don’t know hard it is to make these in full but seems like a cool challenge) and the maybe swap to Engineering for end game since it’s uses are insane for all content. Looking to get insight/opinions about this plan or if there are better plans instead, all help is appreciated!
---
One more note, is there a list of Alliance side plate/mail gear thats good for healing? I'm cool with healing/off-healing and such, but honestly having to wear dresses and stuff kills the fun for me (might be a dumb reason but it's my reason) as a Paladin. So a list of good plate/mail gear for healing would be awesome (I'm ok with like, cloth bracers or something but outside of that no). Leather is acceptable but plate/mail is most ideal (I plan on being fairly casual so that's why i'm not stressing over pure BiS).
---
Good Luck healers? Nah go ahead and pull tank, I am already running out of the dungeon and waiting for enough mana to bubble and/or fear lol
---
Dire Maul jump runs with a warrior friend can net you plenty of gold, but complaining on Reddit about inflation and "exploits" is easier, I guess.
---
Old enough to not get agitated by memes on Reddit, I guess.
---
Lvl up another char
---
I just wanted to add here that Mage or Priest are both good choices. A lot of people tell you to just play whatever on this sub but some specs are just not viable if you want to be able to do things with randoms. I am sure your friends would be happy to carry you if for example you went Moonkin however if you want to do any kind of large group activities with randoms you will have way more difficulty.
---
Mage and Priest both have lots of gear that suits them and they are able to get invite to raids quite easily because they are not "Meme specs"
---
The priest ability Holy Fire deals Holy damage but scales with Fire damage items. Perhaps that detail was the source of confusion?
---
I am Level 25 atm shaman enhance and running through the barrens noticed a level 16 hunter failing to tame a Serpent.  
---
I threw him a heal as he was 5% HP and got agro and tanked it for 10 minutes while I educated him on how to tame a new pet!  
---
He was so happy he got a new pet and I walked away knowing I changed their paradigm and he will pay it forward one day.
---
If I could grow anything resembling a beard I might join you all.  ):
---
Good advice brother thanks for taking your time to explain!
---
Huh I didn’t know that figured everyone got one and doing some numbers in my head I was like shit that’s a ton of soul shards lol
---
Do you think there's enough warrior friends to go around?  Why would he take me, if I am not an enchanter and/or miner?
---
It's not an exploit. Blizzard defines the rules and they let Dire Maul fly. It doesn't matter what *you* think is an exploit, only what Blizzard determines is an exploit.
---
Just remember you are most likely not going to be the only warlock in a 40 man raid
---
ok i read your comments on gouge now.  fights where you might could use it you are avoiding or passing on - but those are the fights that are FUN!  You can lose them sometimes too !
---
Digital blasphemy had one in blue.  Was so goood, lol
---
Idk about that, because the leveling process is likely going to be an average of 3 months across all players (maybe longer).  
---
I just doubt they would end phase 1 before they have long since passed the point most people would be 60.
---
Yeah, pretty much irreplaceable on Hunters, Rogues, and Druids.
---
30 isn’t bad. I guess my general question was is it a deterrent to playing the class or just a slight annoyance
---
DPS is typically responsible for their own pots and all that. If the Lock decides he has enough then he may dole out some but typically DPS won’t be on mandatory feed.
---
Back in the day, my roommate and I were 2 of our 3 top tanks in our guild. The other guy was a total goober, with an over-inflated ego, but he meant well. Man do I miss shooting the shit in tank chat with those two.
---
Horde always lose because we focus on getting kills instead of objectives. 
---
Just how we roll.
---
I’ll be your warrior friend if you promise not to be so angry
---
Here’s what I am doing on Pserver (granted mature economy) but I think scaling would work.
---
Warrior
---
Skinning/mining
---
Vendored all skinning product sold mining on AH
---
Made my first 5 gold by level 12 or so
---
Leveled up fishing / cooking and first aid.
---
Fished And had the mats turned into valuable potions
---
Made 60g by level 17
---
Sitting on about 200g at level 23 currently 
---
Fishing provides me more potions than I can use and more gold than I can spend.
---
May have chosen herbalism instead of LW if I had to do it again. Not sure
---
Plan to BS and Engi at 60 use all the mining mats I no longer need to sell and buy the rest.
---
Also now I have dank food constantly . All plus lots of Stan/spirit 
---
As a side hustle I sell the First Aid, Fishing books on ah for 4x cost and run once every two days to buy more.
---
Isn’t the boomerang reward at the end used as a pseudo-taunt for Paladins? I remember hearing something along those lines...
---
This is true. Is running out of shards seen as nooby as a hunter running out of ammo/arrows?
---
I remember that one, that's a fun quest! IIRC, you have to kill an elite with a couple adds on a pyramid for it.
---
You don't need to show up an hour before a raid to get summons out. If people aren't showing up on time, it's not your job to compensate for their incompetence.
---
Playing the Great Disruptor is so fun in PvP. I am so excited to go back to Vanilla's PvP systems. Really want to see how high I can get my rank (the highest I think I could ever realistically do would probably be rank 10). First two toons I'm rolling are a warlock then a rogue.
---
Yeah man, that's the way, play what you enjoy, best of luck :)
---
My mistake, I just provided a solution but you'd rather find an excuse to keep the tears flowing.
---
Roll a hunter and farm Maraudon
---
Roll a rogue alt and do  pick pocket runs or herb runs  for Ghost Mushrooms in RFD.
---
Roll several alts with alchemy and sell the transmute cooldowns.
---
Or are all these things exploits as well?
---
Realistic?  Full tier 2 for my pally.  Pipe dream?  Hand of Rag and/or Corrupted ashbringer.  Probably gonna run Holy Reckoning so I can heal in raids and bgs but still dump some burst.
---
I did play a spriest pre-2.3 tbc, and my recollection is that if I cast holy spells, it just dropped shadowform and let me cast the spell on that attempt.  I never played a spriest post-tbc so I am not 'tainted' by private servers in this regard.
---
Now as far as what happened when just dropping form without casting something that excluded it (why would  anyone do this?), I don't know.  my gut is no gcd but not sure.
---
How else can he justify his lazy attitude? Everyone *else* is the problem, not him.
---
Nowhere. I'm a carebear. I care about bears, so why would I want to kill people?
---
Definitely will work fine. I played a shitload of Private Severs on my 2009 MacBook Pro.
---
I had an entire bag in my bank that was full of that water so I never had to buy any.
---
Although that’s probably right for the best total HPS, I’ve found that moon glow makes it easier to transition between pvp and pve content without having to respec as well
---
Rogue would probably be my last choice ever.
---
Whenever you have a mission in a game to sneak around and surprise....I’m the one that goes barreling through the front door popping off rounds like Rambo.
---
Sneaking and being stealthy is not my play style at all.
---
No, you want to hit 60 as fast as possible. I dont know if that's what you're talking about, but that's what I'm talking about.
---
That’s good to hear. I’ve been wanting to go warlock but I kept hearing “have fun showing up an hour before raid time to farm shards” 
---
It was pretty much the only con to the class personally. That and other classes sound fun too
---
I don't remember having a problem. Im pretty sure I had drain soul set to shift + q. And I would just do it to trash mobs in the raid as needed. I'd usually try to keep one bag full anyway.
---
CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES - THIS IS MY LAST RESORT
---
The legendary wand priest?
---
If you can only play 5~ hours a week, then raiding is the least of your concerns.  You are likely going to take close to a year just to hit 60 considering the average time to hit 60 240-280 hours depending on class.  
---
Then you have to take into account that you then need to get geared from 5 mans, farm gold, and whatever other crap needs to be done leading into raiding.  
---
Bottom line is that 5~ hours a week isn't enough to raid imo, because you also need to afford to pay repair bills, and you are basically just stuck joining crappy pug runs who will wipe more often than a guild would.
---
You know how long it would take to level a bunch of alchemists?  Also, the value of transmutes goes way down after awhile.
---
I'm struggling with this, too. I decided a while back I want to go Horde in order to experience something new--I had leveled throughout Azeroth so much on every single Alliance race, I always wanted to know wtf the Horde stories were about, what was different, what was the same. Plus, I really want to be Horde anyway if Classic TBC comes out in the future, as playing Alliance will socially lock me to it as it did in vanilla.
---
On the other hand... Elwynn Forest's music, Ironforge, King's honor friend, I'm dying to relive this nostalgia. I'm so conflicted as well.
---
So just tanks or tanks and healers? Do they share cooldown with pots?
---
Yup. Gravestone scepter + wand talent = machine gun in 19 pvp. Running with +100 health on head legs and chest your night unkillable.
---
I'll probably play way less than that even. Do whatever you think is fun. I think on a fresh server you want to have an optimal route and early strategy to get ahead of the zerg and then whatever you do is more enjoyable, and I think without question that the best way to do that (especially for a warrior) is ignore professions entirely until you at least get to the point where there are different zones to choose from and the zerg is at your back. I personally plan to level a priest first, and later stroll through with a warrior where I level all professions as I go and visit zones and dungeons and quests I missed on the way up with my main (likely armed with potions from my 60 alchemy main by then).
---
You should still bring as many as you can, but they shouldn't be wasted on summons.
---
Yes usually tanks and healers and I have no idea if they are on cool down with pots.
---
And healing ring!
---
playing the game to make gold is not an exploit
---
as a healer, heal a group or person farming, use professions , re spec dps to farm , or level a farming alt
---
Dude I had a guy aoe down a pack of mobs with me. 
---
He was a higher leveled warlock, I was oom and about 35% hp and on the road in the hinterlands.
---
I see him riding up on his firey steed, expecting to be killed as I was a sitting duck.
---
He comes over, dismounts, casts rain of fire during my final blizzard (as I said I was oom) and the mobs just barely die before they get to me.
---
I /cheer'd him and /thank'd him, and he kept on riding.
---
This was on a non beta server, notorious for ganks and wpvp. It was fuckin awesome
---
I would say it is a bit of an annoyance, but the bottom line is that most classes have some annoyances to go with them.  
---
Example being that even warriors are forced to do things they don't want to do (tanking).  Pallys have to refresh buffs.  Mages get to make a crap ton of food/water all of the time.  Rogues need to prep poisons.
---
If anything, at least you can make some money while you are getting shards, so it doesn't feel like pointless time spent like most classes would feel.
---
Seems like everyone I talk to is playing a warrior in vanilla.  I really want to warrior tank but I'm not sure because of the amount of them.
---
Ya make sure that's known early on or people will abuse you.
---
“People play the game differently than I do, they exploit” is the modern day version of calling everyone an aimbotter when you die 1v1 in a cod 4 lobby.
---
Im mostly worried as a paladin when getting ganked or smaller wpvp or even solo situations, I'll be helpless to actually defeat any horde.
---
There will also be trash mobs in raids where u can collect shards from. If you are in a raiding guild, Just get together with the other locks and figure out how many shards each of you will need to bring. Iv never been in a raid where the locks ran out of shards
---
I feel the same way.   The only way to get gear is to be the Main Tank I think.
---
I was a warrior main. I know your pain. I'm just a pain to try to hunt. Gnomes for the win.
---
"hey can i get a summon?"
---
"no, sorry"
---
Done.
---
You talking about the money from mob kills? Also how long do shards stay in your bags? Do they have a duration?
---
I understand in wpvp, my best bet is 75% healing and 25% damage, but what about 1v1 scenarios? Getting ganked, duels, jumped by rogues, etc.
---
I am worried paladins will be helpless to fight for themselves
---
Funny I was thinking of rolling a Warlock for PVP/Farming/Free Mount just so that I can make money and then feed my Warrior main gear.
---
Never played a caster before let alone a Warlock
---
It's because we're too damn nice
---
grass is always greener
---
I honestly got into the stress test briefly and as much nostalgia came rushing back to me, I think I’m done with horde. Every single character I ever created was horde and I’ve accomplished almost everything I’ve wanted to on the horde side, so I almost feel like this will be a complete change that I need to re-experience WoW.
---
I’m still not 100% if we will go Alliance, but as of now the alliance voters are the majority in the guild.
---
Good to know I guess it’s just kinda become a meme as another “annoyance” from vanilla compared to retail
---
there are so many of them thast why !
---
pretty awesome shot.
---
i imagine at some point the person in charge of ss of the day was just like "ugh this guy again" and at that point you had no chance
---
Sounds like modern-day Ireland.
---
&gt;on people who can use them best.
---
Which is, oddly enough, usually the council.
---
A lot of them will give up before 60, alot that make 60 will be DPS, some that don't do that will Tank and only half of those people will Tank well.
---
Trust me, you will get geared as a Tank.
---
Why? Twinking is for people who are too bad to play without a huge advantage.
---
cant be the best with alliance
---
Don’t join a run where the tank reserves orbs then. Most I’ve seen on pservers are round robin on orbs. Or just start your own runs. 
---
I’m not going to argue that you are capable of generating the same amount of gold as a healer compared to a farming class but buying gold isn’t the only option. As a healer it’s going to benefit you a lot finding a few friends to make money with. I did DM east jump runs a lot as resto Druid with a rogue friend.
---

---
It's fucking cancer.  You have to go kill imps in the burning steppes for like 15 minutes before the raid.
---
So you run all the pre raid stuff and then start some pugs on the servers discord channel. MC and Only arent hard and players are used to pugging harder things.
---
Everything you post is idiotic lol
---
Maybe it my experience was different but Horde always won BGs, and then when cross realm started horde won literally 100% of BGs. It all went downhill once blood elves released. Guess we're still feeling it.
---
It's 10s to buy a charter. No fee to turn in the charter.
---
Designing a guild tabard costs 10g.
---
Best bet is to roll alliance and have a good time.  Let horde wallow in their self righteous behavior and lack luster effort.  
---
Alliance ftw.
---
Juicy mats.
---
The Tiger Mastery quest chain by Nesingwary gives really nice +str +agi leather gloves.
---
The Captain’s Chest can be picked up at really low levels (I think 36?), but can easily be done by a group of 5 at that level even though the giant is a 48 elite. The reward is a nice cloth bracer with stam, int, and spirit.
---
For Horde there’s a quest in southern Barrens to kill quillboars and take their weaponry. I believe the reward from that is a good healing OH or a huge 2H mace. Also for Horde, there is a quest chain to hunt named beasts that starts in TB, the reward for the level 28-32 ish quest is a really nice helm at a time when you might not even have one.
---
There are so many more. Warsong Boots in Ashenvale, Carrot On A Stick, Rune of the Guard Captain (this is excellent well into raiding) as well as the Woven Ivy Necklace from Hinterlands, the ring from Gadgetzan/ZF, there’s a merchant in Booty Bay that sells a +15 str staff that’s amazing for cat Druids, the alliance quest item that turns you into a furbolg... Yeah there are so many excellent items to get.
---
Ah, ok... thanks
---
Ungoro, Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands.
---
You need 20-30 soul shards per 40 man raid. Depending on other warlocks in your group you may use most of yours or almost none. 
---
Usually you’ll use most doing Summons to the raid (lots of guilds make people meet at kargath and run as one group). And you may give a couple healthstones to tanks, other than that, the occasional Soul Stone on a healer (every 30 min).
---
If you grab a soul shard occasionally off trash in the raid, you can end the raid with as many shards as you started with, or more..
---
It’s not a deterrent! It’s a super fun class, and people want you.
---
fuck that, I want my health stone.
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted. I'm a healer and this is how it's done.
---
That's a great attitude for 8 year old girls.
---
I think it's beneficial to play every class. This gives a knowledge of how to play against them, and offer some tips to fellow players.
---
What’s up with this anti-world buff shit? I don’t understand the meme. They were in the actual game, right? I remember people popping them pre-raid.
---
They're the golden retrievers of wow.
---
By the time sire mail was a thing people had alts. Specifically alts for farming. Druids and hunters and mages were the best. 
---
Also clever use of game mechanics not exploit
---
definition issue.  need to define 'server' - a classic server might have many times the concurrent player capacity of a vanilla server.  Could we have 60 NA vanilla-sized servers, even if that is only 6? actual classic servers?  sure.
---
Mad controversial position: use both. WASD is really nice when you don't want to think too much when levelling, using mouse to move in PvP is a must however.
---
They have to have a gut feeling. Otherwise Classic wouldn't be happening.
---
A million bagillion gazillion dollars
---
It would appear so. I just checked and I have given him 21 downvotes in total, so this isn't the first  time I see him post stupid shit, apparently.
---
How does the rogue tank the last boss?
---
This has actually been my biggest issue with the plan. I always played horde. But we have other friends going alliance so I've decided to just go with it.
---
Is this the first episode?
---
The AV wolf / black war wolf? Or Ogrimar exalted wolf?
---
Blizzard wont acknowledge it for some reason (much like the skeletons not persisting long enough issue), but this pops up reasonably often.  
---
Known issue among the community, but I am not sure it Blizzard is intending to fix it or not.
---
The fuck?
---
Learn to read.
---
&gt; Also clever use of game mechanics not exploit
---
Just a nice way of saying cheater.
---
Not too old apparently.
---
[I can't believe this thing didn't meet blizzard's quality standards.](https://imgur.com/b5xtutl)
---
Is that a holy paladin?
---
Thinking of them as weaklings who go around ambushing people that would otherwise kill them doesn't exactly make me like them more, I just feel bad for them.
---
Would I have to pay that upfront or can I do payments?
---
Didn't keyrings not show up until later in vanilla?  Like well after Dire Maul
---
I assume so, You wouldn't act that way on your own account.
---
Noob to Warlock and was thinking if trying one in classic.
---
Could you farm soul shards as you level and just keep them in the bank?
---
&gt; Why would I post about what I've seen whilst researching this subject and ask for further opinions if I hadn't done any research in the first place?
---
That's the question we're asking you.
---
1. Level enchanting and/or mining
---
2. Stop being so negative and try to enjoy the game in a social way.
---
3. Make warrior friend
---
4. ????
---
5. Profit
---
What does that have to do with keeping Marvel out of a WoW sub?
---
It would get banned by Twitch. Stream sniping might not be against any Blizzard EULA, but it's absolutely against the Twitch ToS.
---
It’s an old old meme I’m sure nobody remembers. An entire guild got banned for exploiting MC and going straight to rag without killing any trash or bosses. 
---
They called it a clever use of game mechanics. Blizzard called it exploiting. 
---
Was kind of funny for a while

Dust wallow may be both but isn’t the tiara quest turned in at dust wallow.
---
Yes, spell damage spec "Shockadin"
---
The Unsent Letter dropped by Edwin VanCleef will lead you to the best low level ring for alliance, the Seal of Wrynn.
---
I thought they expire after a certain amount of time but not sure
---
That’s terrifying
---
What about the hunter or rogue alt suggestions?
---
what if you have a buddy not streaming and you just 'play with him', and he stream snipes? =p
---
&gt; “why don’t I just play alliance...” 
---
Because you're not a shit head.  Lok`tar ogar, brother.
---
As a shaman, you are likely only doing raids as resto. The other two specs are acceptable for dungeons and fantastic for end game PVP though, so it depends on what you like to do.
---
It would have to be payments. That maximum gold any one account can have on a Classic server is 2,147,483 gold 64 silver and 70 copper.
---
It really depends on how tryhard you want to be and other locks.
---
Yeah, you can take 15 minutes grinding 80 shards to both give everyone a healthstone and summon them. You will be beloved, but the bag space and constant trading may be annoying.  Do you really need to do so outside of Loatheb? Not really.  Do you really need to summon everyone? Frankly, you shouldn't have to.
---
I want to believe he’s a troll for his sake, but I don’t think he is. I think he’s just crazy entitled and thinks the world is out to get him.
---
Hilarious
---
&gt;I would say on AV, it was about a 60% Horde winrate, and on smaller BGs, unless I go in with a premade, it was closer to 75% Horde winrate. 
---
How? I never remember Horde winning AV because they lack the bottleneck of the bridge.
---
Org wolf. I know it's a grind but I had tried to do it back in vanilla and never did.
---
You know that blizzard changed it to where there is a Twink only bracket? Anyone who has turned off their exp goes into the same queue... so it’s twinks vs twinks only. So.. your argument is invalid 😂😂😂
---
Zug zug
---
Shockadian or nothing!
---
It’s nice for being to kill stuff a bit better for sure out in the world, but it’s pretty gimped in pvp. Healing touch is terrible in pvp basically and you don’t get any feral stuff. I guess it’s good for av at least?
---
I think you'd still get reported and eventually suspended and then banned.
---
That's only in current, and it largely killed twinking.
---
I feel like you're very close minded. I'm late 20s, have a career and a family. I'll probably play around ten hours a week and won't be trying super hard to get to 60. Plus I'll be leveling 2 characters concurrently. One by myself and one with my best friend who I played vanilla with in high school. Even spending ten hours a week on one character casually would be around 80 hours /played in two months. Considering it takes 9-14 DAYS played to hit a 60 on average, you're just plain wrong. If I could play as much as I did in college, yeah I could have easily hit 60 in two months.
---
its just 10s. You may be thinking about the tabard which is 10g.
---
Well we wouldn’t do the last boss without a third
---
Thanks I guess it will depend on the day for me. If I have time I have no problem farming them but some days I just don’t think I’ll have a ton of time between getting home from irl stuff and raid time
---
Nope, it's still just out surviving. Warlocks and Shadow Priests are bad news for you 1v1 and you're even against a mage, but every other class you can just take everything they dish out and slowly work them down. 
---
https://youtu.be/NOXrGmulbMk
---
This video was my Bible in vanilla, but skip to 8:15 to watch the 1v1 vs a hunter followed by a mage and how the fights are all about control, timing, and just outlasting everything they throw at you.
---
I'd really like to be an amazing tank for my server but leveling a warrior during launch on a ptr realm. screw that lol
---
The subscription automatically pays for every expansion through Legion, this includes classic.
---
* Insta-crit talent isn't really necessary, but it can be nice. Probably better than Repentance for hybrid/healing. Honestly, I wouldn't fret. Either will serve you well for different situations. 
---
* Blacksmithing is expensive to level, not only because of the sheer number of mats you need, but because many of the end-game patterns are locked behind reputation grinds (re: Thorium Brotherhood). Unless you're going to be *The Blacksmith* in a decently hardcore guild, don't expect to craft Sulfuras. Also, Blacksmithing has specializations which mattered somewhat: Weaponsmithing can be Hammer, Sword, or Axesmith; also there's Armorsmithing. Many of the top-tier recipes are limited behind these (Axesmith for Arcane Reaper, for example). Unless you're actively keeping up with it while you level, don't expect to be able to make useful gear whilst you do so. 
---
* Profession wise, i might suggest Alchemy. Can be very nice while leveling to be able to craft/supply your own mana/healing pots, as well as things like Water Breathing potions or Swiftness pots. But you do you.  
---
* Expect to wear some dresses now and again as a healing paladin. Frankly, its unavoidable. Can check http://www.wowclassicbis.com/ for what your gear ideally might look like across the different phase
---
Those 1/40 legends, bless their hearts
---
It is everyones duty to make streamers IG life harder. It will be way more efficient than having just one guy do it. Kinda like anonymous pour against streamers.
---
Paladins are only boring when you take away all the rpg drawbacks of the class. They should have to tithe, they should have to conform to a moral code, etc. But sure, when it's just a warrior who loves Jesus it's pretty boring.
---
Yes it is
---
Thrall mah boy...
---
The hunter farming DM north or Mauradon sounds interesting.   I might try that, but I am not certain as how to do it.  
---
Not interested in playing rouge really.
---
Fuck yea, Taliban bananas!
---
You're dumb and classic doesnt want you, go back to bfa
---
My favorite help is when I was doing the Rhok Delar demon in Burning Steppes and someone saw me and figured he'd come help. As I said " NO DONT " he hit the demon, despawning him ( it must be killed 1v1 or you wipe ) and killing us both.
---
Good times.
---
Isn’t that per character?
---
Yea I don’t like that you can’t see your character in your gear. Customization is everything to me.
---
Wait.. no dual wield for Classic?
---
If your guild members are carrying their own weight, you need zero soul shards for summoning before the raid and very few during the raid (if someone announced they'd be late ahead of time, needs a summon from the entrance to the boss, etc). If your guild members aren't carrying their own weight, find another guild.
---
I wonder if they will release TBC again.. I really want to arena:
---
No need to feel helpless. Nobody will be able to kill you. Worst case scenario in world pvp, someone attacks you, you try to kill them, you can’t so you kite them back to town cuz there’s no way they can kill you.... unless it’s a priest. 
---
In BGs, sure you can’t top dmg meters but you rock at objectives. You can defend 1 AB location by yourself vs 2-3 other ppl. Think about this, if your so hard to kill, think about how good of a WSG flag carrier you will be!
---
Unbreakable raided as Enhancement and totem twisted in the Melee group and applied Nightfall debuff for much of the raiding life and also grinded to high warlord with premade groups.  
---
However, the easiest way to Highwarlord as a shaman was to heal as Resto with a premade this is how I did it in Vanilla and then once reached Highwarlord changed to enhancement for fun.  
---
After ZG came out and having the two trinket from BWL and ZA they did not share a cooldown and you could nearly one shot everything was the best!

Gonna give away so much free gear with that to mail users coming out of Northshire.

Use a staff! High dps like a mace and often has juicy stats
---
Yea... I’m thinking about support as well...., it’s between priest, Druid, paladin and Shaman.. not sure which one. Is there any class that can use the same gear for both PVP and PVE and both of their support / dps specs???
---
pretty sure that somewhere is right around Cata.
---
They don't.
---
Soul Shards don't stack. You'd fill up your bank fast.
---
Looks like Esfand after his mid-life crisis
---
Be the only dwarf rogue on my server so people can say "hey it's the dwarf rogue!"
---
Yeah I don’t know about that. He may have just had bad luck but my ally characters all had a better win rate than 40% in AV. Granted 25% in the others sounds about right.
---
No, the limit is 214,748g 36s and 47c per character and you can have 10 characters on a server.
---
First the world buff was an “exploit”, now farming gold is an “exploit”. 
---
What’s next? Rogue and Druid stealthing through BRD to Grim Guzzler?
---
Some people like doing low level pvp and the only real way to get a fair match after awhile is to organize against other premades. Just because you dont like doing it doesnt mean other people are wrong. Some people think twinking is a waste of time In general. Does that make you wrong for liking it?
---
While this wasn't in vanilla, my best friends in my guild have always been my fellow mages. Whining about how one was winning because they just had a couple of lucky procs, insane combustion numbers because of insanely lucky pyroblast procs, Mythic Blackrock Foundry as a Fire Mage had to be one of the most fun times of my hardcore raiding lifestyle. I'm really eager to foster a similar relationship with my fellow tanks.
---
Tiara of the deep is the quest he is talking about almost certain.
---
I'd go with a Dwarf, then (if you plan to roll alliance), for Fear Ward.
---
I mained a priest in vanilla and throughout most of the expansions.  I'll probably play something different, this time, but I still love the class!
---

How do you go "straight to Ragnaros" in MC? You have to douse the ruins and defeat Majordomo to even summon him.
---
Just like old times
---
Bank space is way to valuable for shards
---
Is there a website up where you can click a class and see the full range of spells, maybe with a filter for "max rank only" so you can just see the one copy of **every** spell for the class you're looking at?
---
What is the best race for Hunters in WG/AB? (Alliance or Horde is fine)
---
This is absolutely dreadful.
---
Orc.
---
Water globe quest in ashenvale for horde gives an amazing leather belt for agi wearers you won’t replace for a bit. Can get it at 23 iirc and it will last until the 40’s easily. 3 agi 4 star and 12 ap. I may have the stam and agi swapped.
---
I've forgotten what the step was, but you had to summon and kill the Twilight Corrupter in the Twilight Glade, Duskwood.
---
My guild was mid fight with the Twilight Corrputer and doing our first solid attempt where we looked like we would get a kill, we finally understood the mechanics and how to kill the mob, when suddenly a foot came out of nowhere and I got eaten/meleed to death. Ysondre had spawned in the middle of our attempt and things went rapidly downhill. Fortunately we'd been killing the green dragons successfully as a guild for a while, we ran back, regrouped, smashed Ysondre and then killed the Twilight Corrupter.
---
Part of me is kind of looking forward to getting involved in doing it all again, part of me is going - no way, no how, do I have that much time.
---
Stop trying to redefine exploits as things you don't like.
---
Raid tank channel was &lt;3
---
Wetlands run.
---
If you can’t handle me at my worst you don’t deserve me at my best
---
The 6 warriors, 2 rets and a mage would answer that for you.
---
I think Westfall run is the only way
---
Ahh, okay. I get ya. My memories of WoW back then are foggy so I wasn't sure if I was misremembering. Thanks!
---
Darkshore is better leveling than Westfall. They should come to you!
---
what about youtube ToS?
---
Horde have better racials, imo, but the nelf kitty form is 10000% cooler than the tauren, unfortunately.
---
Somewhat similar to this. I was playing as a death knight tank blood spec when WOTLK first came out. I was tanking for it and I just kept running through picking up adds because the healer really didn’t have to heal me since DK tanks were broken as shit at the start of Wrath. This boomkin and I were competing for DPS and he almost won but that filthy casual had to eventually stop for mana. I miss the days of playing arena, throwing mark of blood on a warrior and beating the shit out for their healer.

Stop abusing exploits to make gold and get gear.
---
I don't think so. But no one's going to watch it.
---
My name is carebearz so I agree. Except I wanna make friends with the horde in TM...by any means necessary.
---
Classic is hype as fuck till the fucking casuals play and see how difficult it is and rq st level 15
---
Sure but pservers have also been proven to have inaccurate parry rate and iirc weapon skills working differently than classic. So if I was going to side on one being accurate and one being inaccurate I would side on the company that made the game and has the original numbers.
---
The best advice I can think of is: be patient.
---
Classic is a game where everything is hard work and takes a lot of time, but the sense of achivement is like nothing else.
---
This is the one of the reason Classic is being brought back and so many people are excited.
---
We are simply tired of playing games where everything is handed to you and you stomp through content. 
---
One classic example are quests that require you to collect X amounts of an item from a dead enemy and you find out that the chance of those enemies dropping that item is very low and they take a long time to respawn.
---
So if you need 8 items you might have to kill 50 mobs to get it done. 
---
I assure you that when you hand in that quest and maybe get a lvl 5 green axe with some small numbers in it, man that feels so meaningful.
---
Also Roll whatever race/class you feel more attracted to, you are going to spend a ton of time building that character. You have to feel represented by it.
---
I love retribution paladins, they are a meme in classic but thats the role I love. I could go with a tauren warrior and top dps charts but thats just not me.
---
Hope the game clicks with you, have fun
---
Getting 10 ppl to sign is the hard part.   That usually cost you 1g per signature.
---
RIP Beta for another 12hr
---
To crush my enemies, see them driven before me and to hear the lamentation of their women.
---
Either that or make a metric shit ton of gold.
---
Tank e’rything, dungeons all day, raids all night. Be a good tank, clear all the raids.
---
I’m gonna bury myself in Classic and do it all. :)
---
Easiest lvling classes are warlock and hunter. Warlock is good for end game pve and PvP hunter is so so if you really learn how to play them with correct pets and all. Stay away I’d say warrior granted they are the best tanks in the world but if you lvl solo warrior is hands down the hardest one to lvl. If you have a pocket healer with it at all times all classes are easier to lvl. But I’d stay clear of warrior they are heavily gear dependent and require very good kiting for max lvling efficiency. But if you want a challenge and consistently be useful warrior can tank/offtank and dps without really having to change specs while lvling once you hit endgame raids that’s a different story.
---
I vaguely recall that event happening, but I am not sure how it worked.
---
I don't remember the last time I won AV on Horde. I love AV to death but rarely que for it anymore because Ally always win. At least in my experience for awhile now.
---
I felt like Horde used to almost always win BG's, then I think it was in MoP where it felt like everything changed. Just my experience though
---
Cata was definitely a fundamental shift towards casuals and accessibility.  BC and WotLK felts Basically content addons for core WoW.  Everything since has just eroded away what made wow great to begin with.
---
spergs at its finest
---
Let’s be honest private servers don’t even have a copy of 1.12. They have the client copy. All the numbers were run server side, so they don’t have any of that.
---
easiest is kindly asking a 20+ warlock if he summons you ( or level 40 mage portal). otherwise you have to run.
---
They are worse dps than deuid.
---
Not sure, hes a special boy
---
Where is this video from?
---
I thought we were friends, zud?   Weren't you going to do DM jump runs with me?
---
No idea honestly. My playtime in vanilla is pretty limited and I was never a big fan of PVP.
---
Then she's not gonna see her character half the time lol. Tell her to moo-ve on over to the correct faction and figure out what pattern she wants on that cow
---
We be spergin on you pig momas sloppy slit
---
Even m0. Seriously a normal vanilla dungeon is on par with a heroic maybe... that might be a little generous to the vanilla dungeon.
---
This is definitely possible
---
Dude how did I never realise thousand needles is a dick
---
Yeah BC and WotLK was the best
---
Every single time I play on my alliance characters I get stomped on but when I play on horde I can basically afk and the game is won so I'm not sure if it's just you or luck but fuck me I always lose on alliance.
---
Definitely Paladin. A mediocre paladin will still be effective in pvp situations.
---
I’m trying to find similar information. Like, how does the following rank:
---
Pre-BIS 2h Fury for Orc with Arc Reaper
---
Pre-BIS Dual Wield Fury
---
OEB 2h Fury
---
BRE 2h Fury Without Edgemaster’s
---
Dual Wield Fury with access to MC/Ony Weapons
---
I’m pretty sure BRE with Edgemaster’s is BIS from MC/Ony, but curious what the progression path to that point should be, if working to optimize. Even at that, how much better is BRE with Edgemaster’s than OEB or Dual Wield with Deathbringer (as Orc)? It starts to feel like the only time an Orc will ever really need Edgemaster’s is for BRE, and I’m curious how much it matters.
---
Please teach me how to RP the perfect NE huntard.
---
What are those people walking aboot fer
---
The wetlands death swim run to spawn by iron forge, then just take the tram to SW, then run to westfall.
---
Sfan is a narco?
---
Yup, thats exactly how i feel, too. I look up all vids by hamsterwheel, tipsout and other classic content creators almost daily, and after that look at asmongold reacting to the same videos to top it off, just to be in some contact with classic.
---
Its not even funny anymore. August cant come soon enough mate :)
---
This was my safety school when applying for colleges. Thank the old gods it never came to that.
---
Hey to max level, make lots of gold, 100% mount speed, have a good time and make good friendships
---
I bet a few would.
---
Plus I find it a lot easier as a PvE healer to run with the keyboard and pick targets with the mouse than vice versa.
---
I would let people die if they did stupid shit like that. I didn't care if it caused us to wipe. People need to learn.
---
I plan on being well known on my server for tanking 5 non-raid content and for controlling the AH.
---
Take the boat from darkshore to the wetlands. From the dock(where the boat to theramore lands) swim toward the shore and follow the coast until your map tells you that youre in Dun Morogh, drown yourself and spirit rez in Dun Morogh. Walk to Iron Forge and take the tram to StormWind.
---
Huh so the biggest thing about them is inventory management I guess.
---
News to me.
---
I've been playing on the private servers off and on for a few years now, and every single one of them that has a good population is a pvp server.  I hate it, all it does is interrupt my gameplay.  I think I'm pretty decent in battlegrounds, and I consider that to be the higher test of skill since you're fighting people who are the same level and who know you're coming.  Open world pvp is more often like tackling some random jogger in a park and then claiming you're a better football player than them. 
---
Once they implement the pvp ranking system and battlegrounds all of the serious pvpers on pvp realms will be primarily doing battlegrounds to farm honor, not haunting STV so they can 2-3 shot some level 32 trying to do Nessingwary quests.
---
Anyone who can guess what kind of build they are using?
---
Must be a sub hemo build, since they have inc stealth movement speed and use swords if I see it right?
---
You actually asking this?
---
It is certainly annoying in 1v1 situations, but Warlocks are more important in Alliance premades compared to horde premades.  Horde have shamans, which serve as a great source of spelldamage where Alliance really only have Warlocks. 
---
As for UD/ORc, Orc is certainly better. Felhunter can often dispel fears on yourself so the WotFS isn't nearly as useful. The stun resist is very good for a Warlock as well, because the pvp trinket does not remove stuns. 
---
I plan on playing Warlock, and I'll probably be playing undead because the aesthetic is very important to me.
---
You also have to consider time frame of leveling. 1.12 is different than 1.2. First time I did DM and SFK, van cleef was 25 and arugal was 27. They aren’t that level in 1.12 and they weren’t that level in vanilla 1.12.
---
Doesn’t mean vanilla did sweeping nerfs to all dungeons but they did tweak things. They also weren’t the best at documenting changes and used nondescript verbiage often in patch notes.
---
You can’t really go off memory for lots of reasons. Not only are our memories faulty but how many people leveled completely in 1.12? I know I didn’t. I did some leveling in 1.12 but most of my leveling in vanilla occurred well before 1.12.
---
Even then the dungeons weren’t super hard. I solo’d bosses as a rogue doing stealth runs a lot in vanilla. Bosses as early as WC all the way up to ones in BRD. Including last bosses in some dungeons. Hell Amnennar the coldbringer in RFD was easier to solo than Glutton.
---
Unpopular opinion: nothing.  Stats dont matter too much 1-50 as long as your occasionally swapping gear from standard quests, occasional dungeons, and the AH.  You'll also out level them in the time you've spend musing over your BiS strategy.  Once you can start hitting Dire Maul, BRD, Scholo, and beyond is when any gear actually matters.
---
Feel like it needs said, but it sucks to lose as horde more, because we have (and I'm assuming in classic will have, too) longer wait times. 
---
It fucking burns to wait fifteen minutes for a queue, get in as the only healer in a game half over with alliance farming graveyard in WSG. 
---
Meanwhile, over on my alliance characters, they get instant queues with all the exact same scenarios...but it hurts less because the second you're out of a losing game you could queue into a well-balanced team that just stomps. 
---
So my alliance toons can have one win and a loss in the same time it takes to get one loss and fifteen minutes of queue on horde. It's defeating. But no way to really solve it with the PVP imbalance so high. 
---
And it's gonna be the same way in Classic if things go the way they have in beta. 
---
I can't imagine no Cross realm Bags queue times if you pick horde on an 80% horde realm. Thank God they're not doing that. I was on a server like that in Vanilla on one character and had two or three hour queues on busy nights. To wait that long, get in and lose, makes you not want to play anymore.
---
No they are on a separate CD compared to pots. I mained a warlock till TBC and I loved having Death coil&gt;health pot&gt; hearthstone&gt;VW shield combo when needed.
---
&gt; Depending on your class / role, time of day, and player population, getting a group, when you want it, is going to take 5-10mins.
---
More, maybe a lot longer, especially if you are not a sought-after class/spec.
---
&gt; Then about 30-50mins to complete this dungeon if you have a smooth run (no wipes).
---
Maybe for RFC and WC. The later dungeons were looong. If you go into Sunken Temple with only an hour to play you are going to have a bad time.
---
I agree with everything else you said, but I think you are underselling the hassle of getting groups, especially for less-favoured DPS classes.
---
"I love world pvp" starter kit usually involves being a hunter, mage, or rogue.
---
With 50 on an account. So more per account but per server 2 mil. Really thought gold cap was higher per char in vanilla.
---
Get full tier 1/2/3 set.
---
I would go 2 warriors. Having 2 priests seems awkward way better to have 1 priest and another healer for dem extra buffs
---
I love the NE starting area
---
No, more likely they'd all watch the streamer you were sniping for the reaction.
---
strong on warriors as well....Once you get whirlwind axe you don't really need more AP from strength for a lil bit because your weapon damage is nuts. 18 agi at low levels is 1%+ crit chance which is a lot better than some weapon damage.
---
That's exactly my situation too! Never rolled a caster past like level 13. Mining warlock and as soon as he sings 60 I'll use him to funnel my rogue up to 60 as well and then start working on prebis and PvP gear for both toons
---
Only got to get to honored.
---
from what i've seen on pservers, 2h fury is optimal for most of classic on horde side anyways ( not sure about how it does on alliance ) and dw usually pulls ahead later on with certain weps. . . not sure how 2h does with a MoM though, havent seen it yet.
---
Why doesn't the 50/50 guy just roll something else.. or does he have both at max level and can't decide which to use?
---
Yeah and in vanilla classes are so different. Warlocks spam shadowbolt and mages frostbolt
---
Honestly, I plan on having one of every class to max level... eventually.
---
But, Paladin is on the last on my list. Alliance dogs.
---
or you could go with undead (if horde) if you want to dps as they get an extra dot.
---
Too much hate for me bruh
---
No doubt this will happen to at least half of the people I'm trying to drag in, sadly, but if half of em stick around, find the beauty in it, that's more than good enough. Hell, if it's just me in the end it's good enough for me. What's the world without making new friends.
---
If only the game launched with the pre-nerf version..... It's one of the most broken items ever in the game :P
---
Yeah its not fun for the twinks when they are a level playing field fighting other people with similar skill and gear. Which is why real pvp is at 60
---
Yeah really.
---
Yeah and I’ve only ever twinked in current so... my point remains. I’m still right.
---
Who does skip it? 
---
Or are you just assuming it because of the high numbers of night elves in westfall? If so it is mainly because they want to do the deadmnes pre quest before their first dungeon run.
---
NE starting area is the fastest to level in.
---
Not really, they will probably be smart enough to know that people like "new"/new releases in general and will see that the playerbase will die down after a while just like all new WoW expansions.
---
Haha I do the same, sometimes I find myself watching reactions to reactions, it makes me awkward for a second untill I get carried away in the classic wow juice.

 I want them to remaster WoW classic up to WotLK and then branch off from there. No Cats because it was kinda garbage
---
Enriched Manna Biscuits are my best friend as a healer and I get friendly rep with the AD as fast as I can.  I buy stacks and stacks of those delicious little fuckers and bank 'em up.
---
I always used to call them Enriched Shit Biscuits, and I will do so once again.
---
yeah an orc warrior for sure
---
In STV, hanging out at Nessingwary’s camp, turning in quests on a PvE server cause I scared.
---
well obviously it’ll have more players than BFA. a turd would have more. BFA is complete trash atm. i remember even at the very end of legion the game still felt alive. BFA just feels so dead and bad
---
Time to get a new husband
---
The rogues always came into our hunter chat and made fun of us
---
Because that makes a difference to my point AT ALL.... It doesn't.
---
Probably less of a taunt and more of a ranged pulling mechanism, since paladin's lack that for non-undead.
---
my friend refuses to play classic.. does that count?
---
the guy has clear stockholm syndrome. 
---
stuck farming gold in retail for free sub.
---
You get the top discount at honored?
---
I hope to finally find a comfy spot in a community/guild in WoW and get to enjoy all aspects of the game with a lot of grinding included.
---
For one: farming lashers is not an exploit at all. It does not manipulate the game in any way, all you do is dodge elites and kill non-elites in a dungeon...
---
You could even say farming the wolves with the poor pathing isn't an exploit either since the pathing was coded that way when it should have bugged out the mobs to evade all attacks.
---
Either way, I doubt either of these will be lucrative in Classic. The wolves pathing will likely not work the same and the lashers will likely drop less grey items than they did on private servers, just like almost every mob on the Beta so far.
---
So, you really don't need to get butt hurt and say dumb stuff that is clearly wrong to piss everyone off since you probably have nothing to worry about. Blizzard is aware of these methods and they will most likely choose to implement it in a way where there is no exploitation but it stays as true to Vanilla as possible.
---
Yeah I've heard benefits stop after 305 weaponskill and i've also heard after 310. . so i'm not sure about whether or not Edgemaster's is good on orc. . . i mostly saw people using devilsaur on orcs, and I think it's BRE untill MoM from KT
---
Shame. Well, I'd say shaman then. You've got it all except tanking, though you can tank leveling content in the open world. Plus your totems are great for the group. Yeah definitely shaman because it's very group friendly
---
Idk, I saw a lot of people say that they leave after level 10.
---
Appreciated the idea but missed looting weapons.
---
I play WoW for the raids, not the PVP.
---
I’m in a debate with a friend to level a shadow and holy together so we can work together in raids easier. Also share crafted gear and such. So I’d say two priests personally.
---
Know of anyone who has content like this for hunters?
---
This!!
---
yeah same here.
---
Too much black in the beard now tho...
---
Ooo, that’d be an interesting read!
---
Because Duskwood is best.
---
As my man r/Teridus said, it's so they can move on to Westfall and start the journey towards VC.
---
I'm doing the same thing with regards to the Arcanite Reaper. You won't find anything that's better than it, but Dreadforge Retaliator and the updated Demonshear (probably what I will go for) are close.
---
I encourage everyone on every server to unite against whatever devilsaur mafias start to form.
---
They didn't cap snowfall.
---
somehow it posted 2
---
Ok, I disliked Cata as much as the next guy, but there was no way they could have kept adding in 10 talent points per expansion. Talent trees would have turned into a scrolling webpage by BFA. 
---
Not saying the new talent system is the way to go, but I get why a lot of those changes were made. Especially since the community (even before wrath) asked for a lot of it.
---
Ok praxeom I'll check silkroad they are so helpful 👌🏻
---
You go to Darnassus, take the portal to Rut'Theran Village, and from there a Hippogryph to Auberdine in Darkshore.
---
In Auberdine you hop on the ship to Menethil Harbor in Wetlands. I think it's the southern pier.
---
Once you're in Metheril you have two options:
---
 - Option #1, lame: swim south along the coast once you reach Dun Morogh zone, then drown yourself. You'll respawn at a cemetery in Dun Morogh, and then just take the res. Then Ironforge, tram to Stormwind, Elwynn Forest, Westfall.
---
 - Option #2, RP: just follow the road out of Menethil. It will take you east and south through the entire Wetlands, through Dun Algaz, into northwestern Loch Modan. Fron there it's very short walk west to Dun Morogh. Then Ironforge, tram to Stormwind, Elwynn Forest, Westfall.
---
I highly recommend Option #2 for the adventure, excitement(running from high level mobs in Wetlands/Dun Algaz) and profit(there are two nice quests to pick up on the way, *Stormpike's Order* and *The Lost Pilot*)
---
Finally, remember that Westfall is a level 10-20 zone, so you should do all the quests in Teldrassil first or you'll be drastically underleveled.
---
Are you aware of any 2h fury guides or FAQs or general data dumps out there? Curious how the rotation works and how windfury interacts with the build to make it so much better for horde than alliance.
---
So what you’re saying is if I’m on the fence between warrior, Druid and rogue I should go warrior?
---
Don’t mind tanking and every time I play warrior I end up tanking all the time cause people like it when I tank.
---
from what i've seen on pservers, there are a lot of warriors who want to go 2h especially with BRE, it's better than dw for horde anyway.
---
Then how do you get the rep you need for the mount discount?
---
Human Stunlock build
---
Eh beta twitch views are basically carried by Soda and Asmon, it’s decreased big time for others,
---
icicle rod is alliance-only mah boi
---
whats the thing in the top left
---
Only discount through rep is honored. Another 10% from rank 3 pvp. Vanilla isn’t TBC.
---
[Here](https://itemization.info/?search=updated%3A1.10) is every item that changed in patch 1.10.
---
As far as weapons with more top-end damage than Arcanite Reaper that don't require raiding, there's the [Runeblade of Baron Rivendare](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13505/runeblade-of-baron-rivendare) (1% drop rate from Stratholme) and [Nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) (crafted using materials that can only be found in Molten Core but are tradeable).
---
So you are saying they would have 0 views while streaming? And that everyone would be watching other streamers hoping to catch this guy stream sniping the streamer they are watching?
---
 Not one person would be watching him go around kill streamers?
---
Just checked on beta. Canceling Shadowform only triggers the GCD on Shadowform. I tried right clicking &amp; hot key.
---
that doesnt happen in 1.12.1
---
I'm saying if you want to make something of this, you stream snipe and clip every kill, edit it together, and throw it on YouTube after the fact.
---
Two warriors for sure. Priests aren't that great in groups because they really need killing blows to abuse their only real levelling strength. A dps priest without killing blows will be very sad (and will pretty much just be wanding stuff). If the priest likes healing you really only need 1 healing priest per 4 people at least while levelling. 1 priest could keep up 4 warriors or warlocks charging around killing everything no problem.
---
Currently playing as low level 1--70 pvp its alliance being the worser team.
---
Alliance rarely have their heirlooms even enchanted horde generally have all their looms enchanted. Basically making horde have more power as a base.
---
I'd guess copper ore but for some reason its purple /shrug
---
If I actually get into it hard core, get Benediction. 
---
I got Rhokdelar back in the day, but 15 year old hunter me always wanted to be a priest healer (I discovered I liked healing a lot on a Druid raid alt near the end of vanilla so it was too late, then I burned out at the beginning of BC)
---
Having a character named after my hunter and who looks the same as my hunter did as a priest with Benediction would be some weird parallel dimension shit
---
My neck beard game is woefully nonexistent, but what about leg beard? Might not have a husband come August, but it’ll be worth it.
---
Just have fun. If it will be your first attempt, then don't go in expecting anything.
---
Just get in there. Create the class/race that connects the most with you, and have at it!
---
Get the addon called Questie. It will help guide you on your quest to max level without being in your face or anything. It just makes sure you know what quests are where. Maybe also get the addon Zone Level so you can see what level you should be before entering each zone.
---
Aside from that, again, really it's just all about having fun. Classic WoW is more about connecting with your character and creating this epic character rather than just going in, pulling everything in site and being max level in 2 days.
---
This character will take time to level. Every talent point you put in will mean something.
---
I guess my last bit of advice would be to find a leveling guide on WoWhead for your class JUST so you can see what spells you should and shouldn't purchase as you're leveling(in order to save gold.)
---
Eventually you will want to buy all of them, but some things are just a waste of money when you're super low level.
---
WoWhead's classic guides will help guide you through this process and let you know which spells you should pick up along the way. Feel free to pick up any spell you want though.
---
Talent trees make me sad but they are one of my lesser gripes.  Phasing and LFG/LFR ruined server community.  Being able to go into old raids and one-shot world-killing bosses with your weakest attack ruined the stakes for WoW.  Also, honestly, armor and weapons became just so over-the-top it stopped being fun.  When I played in Legion I had transmogrified BC gear the whole time.
---
&gt;Best bet is to roll alliance and have a good time.  Let horde wallow in their self righteous behavior and lack luster effort.  
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Alliance ftw.
---
I would if I could. Unfortunately for me I've always been a Draenei Shaman main (started playing dec 26th 2006 just before TBC launched. Went draenei shaman the second I got the xpac and never looked back.) so I'm stuck with the horde.
---
Noggenfogger drinks count as can't miss rewards right?
---
Never said you were wrong for liking it. You should really try not to jump to conclusions. Lol.
---
o/
---
in vanilla you get one discount at honored, instead of the 5% each rep level or however it was later.
---
And a night elf is likely to already be honored with darnassus when they leave. But you really dont *have* to go. darkshore is a nice quest zone . And personally I love the feeling of the night elf zones.
---
&gt;posts in greekgodx and frenworld
---
Yikes
---
Atiesh, Rank 14, AQ Scepter, and (the only likely one) just having fun.
---
Word.
---
wowhead has a vanilla section for their website IIRC.
---
I want two things: to have fun, and to build a narrative for myself and my characters
---
I've played so many other games, but nothing captures that magic of old Azeroth. Back when we were ordinary people doing extraordinary things; not because we were destined to, but because we want to be a part of something greater than ourselves. Back when the world was... real... it was a real, living world.
---
I've enjoyed my time in modern WoW and other mmos, but they all try to make me feel like this "chosen one." Destined for greatness, protector of life itself... That's not me... I'm just a farmer who decided to step up and lend a hand for a greater cause.
---
My goals are to grow my characters and make them be a part of this world, experience as much of the game as I can, but I really just want to have a narrative for myself again.
---
No, I want to play the game a lot. Not log off and be unable to play because I don't want my stacked buffs to expire. 
---
I also don't want to chase trivially gained game-smashing buffs to make my raids much easier.
---
100% this.... everyone rolls horde to pvp and forgets you have to que into alliance. The alliance side gets instant ques which honestly, wins and losses aside makes farming honor/rank grinding a fair amount easier imo....
---
This is actually so bad I am beginning to question whether it can actually be real.
---
I cannot imagine a scenario wherein any person, mentally handicapped or otherwise even, could think this content was worth uploading or sharing anywhere.
---
I think I am going to have to convince myself this is a piece of satire, otherwise I don't think I could sustain my belief in a future for humanity.
---
My friend and I got hyped on a BC shockadin video. He then proceeded to spec full holy and buy an entire set of healing greens from AH. He was confused why his holy shock wasnt hitting like the videos
---
The timelines for this stuff was in months. Not days or weeks.  It was a different time
---
I always hear Alliance players complaining about how shit they're at BGs, it seems we're all in the same boat
---
classic astro mindset, always waiting to pull the perfect cards instead of doing anything. Worst dps of all the healers in that game for sure tho
---
Your big problem is thinking that retail monetisation model is based around sub numbers. In game services make an enormous amount of money for Blizz. If this conflict theory you have is true (I think it’s bullshit) Classic will need double the subs of BfA at least to break even revenue wise.
---
This is r/classicwow...
---
The holy Trinity.
---
I couldn't remember.  I know I didn't get the discount on my 1st char.   My friends made fun of me, because I didn't have enough reputation.
---
I wonder how much bitcoin I'll need 🙈
---
Weapon Skill seems like a MUST. 305 weapon skill is effectively 3% chance to hit. It also cuts glancing blows from 35% damage reduction to 15%. The next weapon skill break point that is effectively a hit percent is 315, which isn’t practical, but you can get additional glancing blow benefits above 305.
---
Since DPS Warrior’s fury comes from white attacks, that reduction in glancing blow effects seems like a big deal. Considerably more rage from 305 weapon skill. So (for horde races) Arc Reaper on an Orc is good, OEB on anything is good (since it comes with built in +Sword Skill), but BRE without Edgemaster’s loses out on those glancing reductions and the 3% hit, which seems like a lot.
---
I dont know I think a few would watch a stream about someone hunting down streamers on their server. The thrill of the hunt and all of that. Even though its a broadcast so not a very difficult hunt but still a hunt.
---
All of the good pvpers started migrating to Alliance during Cata/Mop  because the alliance racials were just too overpowered. That's why.
---
Almost as if randomly grouping people together doesn't breed good teamwork lol
---
Nightfall was added in patch 1.6
---
I remember trying to figure out how to get to SW as a night elf when I first started playing to learn how to use 1H swords and the whole time I was thinking “I have to be doing something wrong.” 
---
Lol
---
Some people are just too afraid of the social dynamics of forming a group or parking their mains nearby to counteract camping.  Most are just used to one player games and hated the idea that someone enjoyed killing them just for no other reason than to killing.  PVE mob content is PG and pvp is R, there isn't a script you can follow and learn to beat Timmy on his UD rouge
---
He just wants to play one or the other - rolling something else isn't that big of a deal because at 60 we'll be raiding and duplicates won't matter for us. I'm mostly wondering about levelling
---
Question for warriors in darkshore
---
They're equally meme tier in raids...
---
Thanks for the link
---
Is thorium brotherhood rep going to be out in phase 1? Being an OT and getting Nightfall might be pretty awesome cause I want to raid also.
---
Yeah.... ban all those people before they decide to start playing, preventing a heap of customers subbing. Obvious troll is obvious, unless unrelentingly stupid.
---
https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/spell
---
Do you know a single successful gaming streamer that only streams on YouTube?
---
It’s a meme.
---
560views now 🙋‍♂️
---
Template please :D
---
No one on this subreddit takes screenshots lol
---
On pve servers alliance dominates AV and most other BG's, that was always my experience back in the day. I'll probly roll alliance for that reason alone.
---
Yeah. Not a huuuuge fan of the increased focus on the players as the ChAmPiOnS.
---
I don't remember the exact details but there was a moment where Khadgar is standing there, and he's telling you to do everything and it's just... bitch *you* are the Guardian of Tirisfal. You are the most powerful mage *alive*. And all you're fucking doing is Arcane Missiles on the occasional group of mobs whilst I do all the hard work?
---
Motherfucker you should be the one fighting Gul'dan and shit - we should be *helping* you, not you helping us.
---
I feel like there will be a lot more waiting around than that.
---
Starting zones go up to level 10. Why wouldn't you leave after 10?
---
Do warlocks need to resummon their pet after dying in a BG?
---
&gt; Digital blasphemy
---
https://witnessthis.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/digital-blasphemy.jpg
---
I think everyone had this wallpaper at some point.
---
Yeah dude for sure. I noticed that horse usually won AB and ally usually won AV, WSG was more of a toss up.
---
I mean Weakauras really aren’t a must at all in Classic. What do you think they are required for?
---
Crystal of Zin-Malor is my favorite trinket of all time and I do the quest to get it on every character. For those not familiar, the chain starts at an elf near a lodge in EPL and sends you to Winterspring, Azshara, and uninstanced Dire Maul. The trinket has the effect of draining 100-500 health and mana every second - somewhat like the Skull of Impending Doom - with the kicker that it lasts for as long as it's equipped. Sure it's not useful in general situations, but if you need to give your healer a headache or get to the front of a long dungeon it's a fun tool to have.
---
No one asked for this.
---
At all.
---
I can see it now, people will abuse this to grief other players by disabling xp and queuing for a random dungeon.  
---
Bad decision all around.
---
yeah, it looks really bad
---
Wrong sub bro.
---
Have you considered that the devs might have placed that in there intentionally?
---
I did gravitate towards that eventually (I'm not subbed to WoW at the moment so i didn't even think about it or use it on a daily basis) but I couldn't find a way to block out other ranks of the same spell so I could get a better overveiw, and some spells seem to have their last rank way before 60 and were back four pages!
---
Yeah it’s a voice line not text line.
---
Those are probably the best races to choose for rogue pvp. Orc has nice stun resist, dwarves stoneform can clear dots allowing you to vanish properly, and escape artist is great for things like frost nova. Honestly I would say orc or rogue is slightly better than dwarf and undead but they are all excellent choices
---
Loads of salt. Not super funny.
---
Thank you! What level do you recommend going to westfall? Or should I just go as soon as I complete ALL the quests in teldrassil? I think that’s about level 12. 
---
Also, where should I go to pick up quests for westfall so I’m equal to my friends? Is it stormwind or goldshire? Or should I just run straight to westfall and the quests will be there waiting for me?
---
You are either a kid or mentally ill. Either way take a break from the internet my dude
---
As if youd skip that beautiful heavenly zone
---
i converted it also. horde only: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeoqLvuppubcE\_Rl5f7khydtZ6f\_jZ3qG1-WdQLNbkg/edit#gid=1019580485](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeoqLvuppubcE_Rl5f7khydtZ6f_jZ3qG1-WdQLNbkg/edit#gid=1019580485)
---
I find that when I can get a group talking and listening as horde, we pretty much always win.  People just need to communicate, it solves all the issues.
---
Lol yeah that is quite the feat. I don’t quest much but I generally manage honored with a second faction by 60.
---
Don't believe so.
---
Oh the going rate is only 300$ not bad🐷
---
A lot of it for me is that there's a beta going on that's very publicly streamed, and I'm unable to participate in if.  If it was a closed beta with NDAs applied, I'd be content to wait it out until release.  If it was an open beta, I'd be playing and not watching/reading a lot of game-related stuff.  There's a feeling of "other people are getting to play and I can't" that is currently driving me to consume all information out there.
---
so you are saying people should play their video games how the video game designers want them to play instead of how they want to?
---
Twink pvp and a whole world of the same low lvl cap is different.
---
Try these filters to only show rank 1
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/warlock-abilities?filter=13;4;1#0-2+20
---
It might miss a few things but you get the idea.  Play around with the filters to show what you want.
---
I just go to Wetlands and swim along the coast til I zone in to Westfall, drown, and spirit rez at sentinel hill.
---
Funny considering last night I absolutely ravaged STV at level 45 with a couple of other Horde randoms. Against max levels and all.
---
The quest chain after completing Stockades gives a [very nice ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2933), and with rings being quite rare while leveling, you'll be using it for awhile.
---
Dosnt matter if they are successful, I said a few people would watch not thousands.
---
Also I dont watch many streamers and the ones I do watch I watch on Youtube as I prefer that over Twitch. I may be in the minority on that sure but I'm not I doubt I'm the only one who watches streamers on Youtube. Actually I know I'm not seeing as they share they current number of viewers and most gaming streamer I watch have 10+ viewers. Some have 100+.
---
Are they successful? Well that would depend on your meaning of the word. Are they as popular as Asmongold or Soda? No but thats why (imo) they are good. They dont have 1000s of 'fans' to please. They can focus on the game and actually answer questions on stream and talk about the game rather than constantly saying 'Thanks ubiGeofram for the donation' or overreacting to something small just because they have to keep people entertained.
---
But to just end this fucking comment thread I said a few would watch them. Not thousands, not hundreds, a few. A few is not many but more than one. I'm one who would watch it. Im pretty sure at least one more person would watch the stream fairly often. So yes...a few would watch the stream.
---
something something humans literal racist nazis
---
Can't have a beard at current profession only moustache :(. So no greasy neck beard for me
---
Not unless they're gods.
---
I'm not sure what the guild politics among the officers was at that point, I was a pretty freshly recruited warrior all things considered only having joined the guild a month or so before the first Rag kill.
---
It was an almost immediate effect of tanking a couple back to back UBRS runs with the insufferable warrior that I learned to avoid any group he was apart of because he knew next to nothing about tanking.
---
The only reason I could see for him being promoted to MT was his general reputation throughout the guild as being available and online literally 100% of the time.
---
In the month I was there it became apparent the Guild officers and playerbase were definitely had a high opinion of the guy and with the superhero moment of tanking Rag 3% of his total life or the first kill it was inevitable at that point that he would be promoted.
---
The exodus of all the other warriors was pretty much immediate after learning that the MT who had done all the work marking targets and coordinating raids and managing, behind the scenes, the ZG runs so that the guild had 2 groups that could clear it.
---
The leaders of that guild shot themselves in the foot for not appreciating there hard working MT who I know was immediately picked up by a guild that was regularly clearing BWL in a single raid night and was working on AQ 40.
---
Weapons doesn't titanforge though. SO your point regarding weapons in retail is invalid.
---
even if i am not tanking, dungeons with randoms... i always mark skull, x, etc. and i mark the tank with a yellow star so everyone knows who to follow and who to stand opposite of... and sometimes i mark the healer a moon, so tank can see if healer is in LOS...
---
Legion is as retail as vanilla now.
---
Just let my parents know that I’m quitting my job and moving back in and it’s time to clear their belongings out of the downstairs office. I let them know that I bought a blow up mattress and mini fridge with my last paycheck, and of course set aside money for my wow subscription. August 27th will be amazing.
---
Did not know that, Thanks  
---
The more you know.
---
Thanks mate, didn't know that.
---
Mate i'm either one or the other.
---
Make a new server without world buffs problem solved 
---
/s
---
Pot and rocket boots out of there!
---
The healing ring is maybe not BIS but very strong for surprisingly long.  Was unlucky with MC/BWL drops, didn't up replacing mine until the AQ20 ring and the AQ bronze dragonflight ring.
---
Not quite as much top damage, but close enough where it is probably worth bringing up: [Blackblade of Shahram](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12592/blackblade-of-shahram#dropped-by) is a rare epic drop from General Drakkisath in UBRS.
---
Guess you're fresh meat then!
---
Is calling everything exploits a new meme?
---
This is a beyond silly response. Asking for bugs to be fixed is not the same as someone asking for a BFA style change.
---
An epic world drop no less.  Now thats something special
---
As a Druid practicing Hurricane and Swipe on Lashers. This is not an exploit
---
He says as a warrior with engineering in classic lmao
---
Tell me why I shouldn't play a Tauren Shaman.  
---
  
---
Give me all the min/max advice against it. 
---
Please and thank you :)
---
For what it's worth I play priest.  For most raids I really want to see 10-15 healers, split mostly evenly among priest/druid/shaman (horde of course).  The utility of each class is enough that I don't consider any healer to be the "best", it's more about having some of all.
---
Isn't there a NSFW artist whose character has one of these on?
---
Boy, can I relate to this sentiment. Nothing can quite satisfy the itch.
---
I've been taking my time leveling via quests and the occasional dungeon run. Feel free to shoot me a PM if you want to join me. It's actually been a decent time and the more the merrier!
---
What’s the quickest route to getting a bank alt system setup
---
Did that. Realise the Alliance was worse. Switched back.
---
For leveling I’d look at other classes in your group. If you have 1+ paladins for example, the gear distribution will be tough leveling. If you have a lot of clothies, regardless of lock/mage/priest then the other warrior will be easier to gear out.
---
Aside from gear, having a 2nd warrior means you’ll have much better chance of having a tank online each night to do elite quests and dungeons. It is also considerably stronger at 60 for pve or pvp
---
If a level 40+ healer is outta mana, maybe they should learn to drink every time they’re out of combat. Mage water is free, don’t conserve it, drink even if it’s only for a few seconds. The more often a tank isn’t in combat they’re losing rage and the dungeon is taking longer. Healers need to learn to manage mana better if they’re looking g like this meme, don’t slow dungeons down because you are trying to conserve water, bring enough.
---
*ZUG ZUG*
---
Oh, I remember. There were a bunch of rep grinds (I have the Chimerok Chops recipe on my main) and you had to get to Exalted with the Silithus rep, there were a bunch of steps that required clearing raids within tight timelines or needed multiple raid groups to complete (Looking at you Eranikus - it took 120 poeple to take that dragon down on our server).
---
And being able to clear BWL in the time limit meant you were already geared and had it on farm.
---
When I think about the amount of time we put in - I can't imagine ever playing at that level again in classic.
---
And major cities count as Inns, right? Like anywhere in Org, IF, SW?
---
See: keydars new "best raider" comic.
---
My old guild had content up to BWL on farm I would bring about 30 shards to each raid and complete it with about 5-10 while still farming them on trash as needed. I'm just happy I was not a Mage who would start making water and food half a hour or more prior to the start of the raid. When we did harder stuff I filled every slot I had and used them all.
---
Pvp is where I would burn them up really fast.
---
I forgot the name of it but I had a massive bag that would hold only them, I would keep that bag full all the time. I think it was also purple red ish in colour. Ill have to get another one.
---
&gt; horse
---
So Alliance is winning everything?
---
&gt;But you can't totally get to 60 with quest &amp; dungeon gear.
---
Is that a type, because yes you can.
---
Doesn't enh get kited by literally anything with a slow?
---
I don't know, the NE starting area is pretty good. I think if anyone were to leave it would be to quest in a group with their non NE friends.
---
I personally stay. Its good, not as competitive as Elwynn Forest, and you can go straight to Darkshore which is the best leveling zone for the Alliance for that leveling range.
---
That Charlie sheen line was BiS
---
Frost is a very safe leveling spec since it‘s naturaly loaded with cc effects.
---
Yeah horse you read that right.
---
I mean, I have a lvl 18 Warrior who is geared out in BoE Blues and any green I can get. He is pretty easily able to take on 2-3 mobs at a time (level appropriate) instead of the usual 1-2. 
---
Compared to my Warlock who can essentially be leveled 1-60 naked with no issues - some characters are more gear dependant then others.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
You must be confused with 20 days and days /played... 11 days /played means you would have to play for 10 hours a day for 20+ days...
---
It’s really easy, it’s just like using an ability in retail it just changes your action bars so people panic.
---
If I had to guess, probably the elf zones, but I'm not really sure where you go after ashenvale.
---
Take the time to explore and don't be afraid of failing.
---
There are a ton of little hidden things scattered throughout the world, most aren't anything super important or noteworthy, but it's those little things that makes the world feel more alive.
---
And, you will die. A lot. You'll hit walls with questing, and that's natural. Keep trying new strategies or look for help when you hit those harder quests. People are (hopefully) going to be friendly and willing to help.
---
I don't lol
---
Because Alliance is the head on the right as all three heads.
---
Pretty sure it's on by default in beta. We have class colours on raid frames and more raid frame options too.
---
This is vanilla, you didn't need that /s
---
Everyone is responsible to be AT the Raid on time. Summons should be reserved for people needing to go respec, buying reagents, replacements, etc.
---
imo tauren would be best for shaman ;)
---
Their only real leveling strength is spirit tap? Do you think that's what makes them one of the best levelers? I don't think so lol he could just be a healbot that wands and you don't need spirit tap at all.
---
Priest man, we play double priest in my 5 man grp, the second priest plays disc shadow and does  all the dispells/bubbles/renews up too 40 ect which allows the healer to focus on heals loads more. Then once you hit 40 you go full shadow and destroy anyway...double priest is really fun. Just comp for gear.
---
Get out of /r/classicwow and check our r/worldnews for once. It's the protest in Hongkong over China's dictatorship rules.
---
Is this addon downloadable from somewhere please
---
That's perfect, but I didn't have the quality nor quantity of quality of games to choose from back then.
---
I'm hoping to hit 60 before Borderlands 3 comes out in September and for sure taking time off of wow to play Cyberpunk.
---
That plus the character I make won't feel all that special to me because I've done the journey with 3 characters 15 years ago - and there is no way for me to ever re-live that.
---
While I can't wait to get on, level, do dungeons, make new friends, raid and pvp - I just can't see myself pushing to play that extra hour every night.
---
For me I keep sending really negative energy out over the "classic summer" late August release. I mean sure I'm glad we're getting it at all but it's frustrating that the things they're trying to test are mainly new things nobody wanted anyway, at least that's how it seems to me.
---
&gt; Just not visit the subreddit
---
If I was considering this, I would not post te thread. Also before posting thw thread I did not know it's aa common issue, that's why I've asked about it.
---
&gt; Numerous warnings
---
What warnings? Why are you lying?
---
Realistically if you manage bag space well you should constantly have a decent pool of shards at all times, since literally anything killed gives 1 due to using the drain soul talent to Regen Mana during solo play. If it makes a difference, I've heard a grind from scratch to 40 shards is about ~15 mins of grinding, give or take
---
UC has invisible 48-52 mobs in the courtyard which can be killed by locks to easily get shards safely and without a lot of travel time. Ditto can be said for Duskwood, and I know a lot of locks like to farm those places due to ease of travel
---
&gt; It would have been two lines for them to fix this. Two. Lines.
---
They literally mentioned in a blue post that they didn't fix it to stay consistent with how it was in all of classic.
---
Nailed it
---
They are blue in retail, changed in TBC.
---
Shadowmeld for Night Elves is under-rated in BGs if you ask me.
---
I wouldn't say it should be fixed, but if someone wants to develop/use an add-on to change a visual, so be it. It's their game, they can play it how they want (within TOS)
---
I’ve never been in a guild that this is the case. I don’t think all dps usually ask for healthstones, but I don’t think I’ve ever been denied a stone for being a dps either.
---
Depending on how organised your guild is, you may need to farm shards to summon lazy raiders to the raid entrance, which can quickly burn through some shards. Once content is on farm you can often recover some shards midrun from trashmobs
---
I found a mate and created an offspring whilst on Azeroth hiatus.
---
How does one navigate quitting a job, marriage, and parental duties to recreate my old Hunter and Mage? Neck beard not a problem, apparently it’s the only facial hair that will grow consistently.
---
Any changes or additions should be put on a different set of servers that people can remove their character from Classic servers and transfer them to that weirdo server.
---
No shit sherlock. Y’all have never played retail WoW!?
---
Correct
---
So much truth to this! But when I switch and run a bg on Alliance, they lose. I can't win.
---
I posted this in another thread but I was on an Alliance heavy server in Vanilla (Gilneas) and Horde had near instant queues while Alliance had a 30-45 minute wait for a regular BG, and sometimes the only Horde players I would face were the HWL premade team.  So it was wait 45 minutes to get 5-capped in AB.  It was far more worthwhile to join the 2.5+ hour queue for AV and just do stuff around the house waiting for it to pop because the matches would last for hours and Alliance won 90% of the time.
---
M+ anything under 10 is a sad joke. If you think they are difficult then whatever. Vanilla dungeons weren't hard in terms of mechanics, but they were difficult in terms of setup &amp; execution. 
---
You don't just run in and pull half the dungeon and AOE it.
---
You can always use an addon if Blizz decide to not implement it.
---
So in your wiki, what category does DM fall into?
---
altaholic, recount, some kinda of bg timer, with all the normal raiding ones but that fucking one that lets the raid leader check if I remembered to bring enough shards or not.
---
If it is an option, all streamers I've seen are not using it and it is not there by default, just rechecked
---
why should it not be possible to run the math down for all the mobs you encounter while leveling to show the needed number of frobos to kill?
---
sure, we would have to wait for the hp tables to be datamined, but that‘s just a matter of time (or maybe is alrady done during beta? )
---
But aside from that, you can run the numbers down. The different frobo ranks just mean that you got multiple graphs instead of one, but aside from a different constant, the calculation is the same.
---
Same reasoning applies to talents, shatter, etc.
---
This isn‘t even that hard to do, it just requires time and work and the before mentioned list of mob hp.
---
Nonetheless, the pseudo math result shouldn‘t be that far off reality anyway and should work well enough just for the simple answere "what to stack".
---
But the graphs could be nice when you attempt to optimize. Too bad I no longer have he time for stuff like this, kinda picked my curiosity while typing this.
---
It's in his comment that got downvoted to oblivion because reddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1hb3e/blizzard_could_have_fixed_the_quest_giver_icon/erd79v6/

It's not there as far as I can tell. One of the Priest streamers I've been watching has specifically been looking for it and can't find it, nor can anyone in chat ever find it.
---
Make an alt with a cool name. Run to capital. Sit at mail box. Send stuff to it via mail. Leave it in the post until ready to do something with it or before 30 days.
---
Female whatchu mean
---
stats definitely hurt more as a warrior - if you arent packing enough juice in your kaboose levelling will be a pain. casters not so much.
---
It's so beautiful to see one in action. I know hunters are usually a favorite in that bracket but they just aren't as absurd.
---
For the curious: https://youtu.be/vRmldX9Mc00
---
if the horde Held at IB GY and turned it into a slow slog it turned into a horde advantage. I remember talking to an alliance friend (i played horde) complaining about it since it was an earlier checkpoint in the game it was more impactful then the bridge (since if the horde hit the bridge if alliance didnt full D horde won)
---
I hope to be fully naxx geared within two weeks of server opening
---
No, you can spec into 2-handed though.
---
Wait so jump runs aren't exploiting? Or are you just planning to exploit too? Calling the kettle black much?
---
It's not that easy, you can get an SCT type add-on that shows your healing values next to your character but an add-on that "attaches" those values to the player healed was apparently impossible with Vanilla client. Hopefully it can be developed for the Classic client...
---
I just don't see why we can't have it by default, not like it breaks anything...
---
But they dont matter enough that you need to go out of your ways for some amazing piece of low level gear like OP is asking.  AH greens will do you fine until early 50s.
---
&gt;Yes, they're exploits.
---
&gt;An exploit (known as "exploitive activity" by Blizzard) is a method of playing the game in a way not intended by the game developers to gain an advantage over other players. As with all massively multiplayer online games, World of Warcraft has its share of players who exploit and cheat.
---
Which doesn't apply to DM runs - if you were bugging out bosses or gameplay mechanics so you weren't getting attacked or making mobs get stuck - then yeah it would be an "exploit", but just because something is more efficient - doesn't make it an exploit.
---
Also it's not a 2019 game where every person and every class must be able to do the same thing all the time.
---
Level a class that can farm it... if you don't, that's on you sweetie.
---
Not sure if subtley racist or...
---
Yep. If they're going to fuck it up anyway by making changes may as well bring some specs up to snuff. I dont trust that they'll leave well enough alone personally, so may as well ride the shitshow until the wheels fall off... but honestly if they fixed memespecs it would kill diversity. It would be world of moonkin. Who doesn't love moonkin.
---
i thought the same way - then levelled a dwarf priest on Nostalrius, raided through bwl - they are the most fun healer imo. a deceptively versatile and engaging class
---
That's what I guessed but zero in in this sub post.
---
Most likely yes,  but I think people underestimate the way the vanilla meta has evolved (on private) since they played it themselves. Serious raids are going to have raidcomps of like 38 warriors 1 healer and 1 lock, not even memeing.
---
Yes that's the one I'm thinking of.
---
If they were to do classic plus content I personally would like to see them do side-grade raids where you can get gear for classes targeted more towards fixing issues in their bad specs rather than changing the class themselves. This would also help stop powercreep from the additional content.
---
I Think the human areas are just really popular and populated. Teldrasil is a island far away from the other races. So While the 'Wetlands run' is notorious (You can skip the wetlands run by jumping off the ship once you enter Menithil Harbor jump off the boat and swim along the coast line and drown your self at a certain spot and you'll be at the dwarf starting area graveyard. Easy to get to SW from there.) I think a lot of people just want to level with their friends that rolled human or dwarf/gnome.
---
The last video appears to be in German, perhaps someone can decipher the combat log, though it's pretty low quality.
---
Hey all, this is my second WoW article for Dignitas and I'd really love to hear your opinions / how you enjoyed the article :)
---
If you're going to pvp just do engineering from the start. It will be useful in wpvp while you level anyway.
---
Personally idk what I’d prefer tbc or classic plus, I do know I would LOVE to have an mmo that’s more up to date but held classic philosophy’s in it. Like classic with new stuff and graphics 
---
But I do understand that tbc is probably safer. Idk I wouldn’t wanna play classic forever but I do find it WAYYY better than anything we have on the market today by a long way
---
I skip it when I level alts, just because I usually grind a bit more than most and don’t really like the darkshore and ashenvale look. 
---
If you aren’t grinding at all, you should really not skip it.
---
If you think Blizz bases WoW success on sub numbers you are clueless. The cash shops services are enormous money spinners in retail. Worth millions of subs.
---
Female best male!
---
what exactly is inconsistent here? what am I looking at?
---
Full t1+Benediction on both factions. Forced to Horde with friend group; will help them out for progression then focus on level an Alliance alt with some other close friends.
---
I haven’t leveled through the NE zones since Vanilla. Since then it’s been Draenei, Dwarf and Pandarian. I’m looking forward to it.
---
Who cares
---
Yes i wouldn't mind at all. Say what you will, but classic was horribly balanced. I wouldn't mind the ability to play a currently weaker dps class in a raid without feeling that you are a burden to the raid.
---
However, Blizzard making changes does not mean it will be better. Nonetheless, I'd argue that the fear that something might get worse should stand in the way of progress/potential improvement.
---
In my opinion, changes should be voted on and tested carefully before being put in
---
I play whichever one looks better. Troll female, orc goes either way, tauren male, undead male, night elf female, human can go either way, dwarf male, gnome male,
---
Lol I’d give you one if you ask nicely
---
You keep spouting the same definition, yet fail to properly reason why you think it's an exploit. The only thing thing resembling that is you reasoning that because it was removed, it must have been used in unintentional ways.
---
Guess what, Talent Trees were removed, as were weapon proficiencies. Should probably stop exploiting them.
---
I started the game in my late teens and rolled Alliance. I'm the type of gamer that will play on the side of the good guys when given the choice. I loved the idea of healing Teldrassil and such.
---
But then in my early 20s I wanted to see the "other side" of the story. So I rolled all of my toons horde. Particularly, I found the undead interesting to play. Their revenge story was fascinating. And the Wrathgate was a fantastic cap to some of that arc.
---
Then when the game lost my interest and starting doing pandas and other weird bs that fit nowhere in the cannon I quit.
---
But since the earlier versions feltike home I ended up playing on private servers due to Blizzard deciding to not offer me that service.
---
And now in my 30s I'm firmly back on the Alliance side of things. I will miss windfury, but other than that I'm in the right place. This is home.
---
Group chats were great... until you talked shit about someone in the wrong channel.
---
What made it even better was when you raided on ventrillo you could open two servers at a time and just mute your mic on the raid vent while have your own private chat on a different server, no way to screw up there.
---
It's good to have debates over WoW lore at least lol, too many people know the bare minimum of the deep story anymore
---
i strongly disagree
---
uh okay good job?
---
Carebearz, the gnome protector and savior of Stranglethorn?
---
How does that make it so people can play more ? Not for me at least. If raids are at i.e. 19 I dont have time to time to tet the world buffs on raid day. That is why when I played on private servers I would do it the night before and just log out at the designated location. Having them run out while offline would just mean I wouldnt get them and wont give me more playing time.
---
Three ways to pick a digital avatar. What you are, what you want to be and what you want to look at.
---
There is no wrong answer.
---
Hell this is the state of Horde PVP as well. Ugh.
---
How come? All wl resources talk about this issue vs other dps classes like mage since they have aggro mitigation tools.
---
Yep. Ally pugs never won shit on either of my vanilla servers.
---
Oh right, thank you
---
Priest hands down. Either Warrior or Priest would be competing for gear just as much, but Warrior is far more gear dependent. For the most part Warrior DPS is pretty bad until you get to about 40, and even then isnt that good. An SPriest should be able to outDPS a Warrior until the mid-50s when he starts getting some gear, barring mana issues. Considering mana issues (like when continuously pulling), I think the SPriest can still outDPS a Warrior until about 40.
---
Dopamine Rush sounds like a good guild name
---
priest, especially if on alliance. Alliance enables holy priest dps with paladins, on top of the usual healing priest and shadow priest builds
---
Yes. Druid healing threat is really high and they don't have fade to lower it.
---
Woah bro, slow down.. nothing touches CT. Nothing. FF6 is close,but no cigar.
---
What would you change? This is ofc personal ranking.
---
/r/lostredditors
---
Pally/lock is hands down the best QoL and will give you the easiest time getting into raid groups. Alliance locks are cryptids. The levelling is better and you will have less competition for gear in general, to say none between the two of you. Both of you having free mounts also won't lead to the issue where one guy can go fast but has to wait on the duo partner. If you like fucking with other people, dropping doomguards or infernals is also a plus. The ability to do everything in SM/Ruin is also something not to be underestimated.
---
Pally/Warrior is nothing to write home about in PvE, though by no means bad. Warrior is helped significantly by reducing downtime and, if tank / heals, is a shoo-in for dungeons. The two will clash on gear a lot because of levelling in Ret, however, which could lead to some issues.
---
Pally/warr has a main advantage in being able to unleash the true power of a warrior because of Blessing of Freedom. You'll be an unstoppable death machine with a tanky healer buddy, so an awesome 2s group.
---
Pally/lock ALSO let's the warlock go ham by alleviating pretty much every issue the warlock has bar mobility. 
---
As 2s, warrior will probably allow for faster 1v1s and holds together fairly well in a group. If you go SL, lock kills are pretty slow and thus won't be able to, for example, hold an objective with a steady stream of people coming in. If conflag, you outnuke Warriors even but are more squishy, which can be fine but requires a lot more careful play and positioning. Comparing warr and conflag would be like a wrecking ball vs a death ray. Either way, you're fucking dead.
---
There's a few I have
---
1) Reach level 60 and accumulate at least 850 gold before Phase 2 starts (yes, my initial plan was to buy an unarmored epic mount, but those will unfortunately not be added. Still, this is a nice challenge to give myself)
---
2) Reach rank 7 in Phase 2 or 3 for a specific pair of boots. (As a shaman, the rank 7 boots will increase Ghost Wolf's movement speed from 40% to 55%, turning it into a level 40 mount that can be used in-combat and can be cast in just 1 second. That's too good to pass up). Rank 8 wouldn't hurt, either, but it just doesn't seem worth it to grind honor beyond that.
---
3) Clear through all raids (except for Naxx and the second half of AQ40) while specced as an Enhancement Shaman.
---
Thanks! I had fun.
---
It’s been so long since I’ve played wow, I forgot how you gather and use those mats to create items or gear lol... and I want it to stay that way until classics finally out.
---
No class that can do all that is doing it in one set of gear
---
[Blackfathom Villainy](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6561/blackfathom-villainy) is definitely worth it for warlocks as well. If you can do the quest in your mid 20's, the wand will easily last you 10+ levels.
---
Mages can start their [wand quest chain](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-class-quests-classic-wow#mages-wands-level-30-40) at 30, so if someone is helping you with that chain, the BFD wand is less valuable. You do have to run SM:Lib to finish it so it's more realistic that you won't get it until around 35, and if that's the case you may as well get the BFD one until then.
---
It’s not like I ever had one set when I played but I was just curious..
---
I tend to roll male, lack of occasional wierd whispers &gt; mailbox dance tips.
---
ok
---
I gotta agree with x2 on this one. WoD PvP for me was really fun too. SV Hunter (although I do like the current melee build a lot) was the best iteration and I had a blast with it. So many clutch kills and long fights against pillar humpers.
---
It's 2019 nobody's going to be using DKP
---
Double warrior would be better. 1 priest is already strong enough for healing, 2 priests is overkill in healing potential. Also it would make dungeons, especially wnd game dungeons more reasonable to have two warriors in the group than two priests. But even with dungeons aside double warrior is stronger because of the extra damage going out
---
I like female humans and night elf, everything else male
---
Not a druid but I know the answer is a yes from MTing. We'd be super pissed at you pretty fast otherwise.
---
Also just shout out that you are looking to pair with a healer. As a healer that would occasionally join battle grounds, I would look for a warrior and just follow them around with the heals.
---
Subtlety and its Priest equivalent are  sort of a trap of a talent for PvE. The only time you really get threat is when theres 0 DPS or tank on the target in raids. So 80% of whatever threat you have, is still greater than 0, thus, it affects basically nothing. It will mean OTHER healers will pull before you, but that just really means youre taking talents that are worse for the raid for the sole purpose of trying to arbitrarily hit higher numbers.
---
You only ever use Tranquility as a joke really.
---
Something something horde always deserve it (which is the absolute truth)
---
Why
---
yeah man the important is your friend , you did not make the wrong choice for that .
---
The osrs approach would also mean players voting and what goes in the game and what doesn't. I think that's the most important part hands down.
---
Depends on race and class.
---
Poor esfand sitting alone on a swing

The Warlock's [Soul Harvester](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20536/soul-harvester) (or [Abyss Shard](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20534/abyss-shard) if you prefer.
---
It's a great staff and has an amazing/unique model. It's definitely missable if you're going for speed, though. I think you have to clear Sunken Temple for it.
---
Your best bet is to find a guild now that has already scheduled to raid on your available days. The weekly Looking For Group thread in this forum is a great place to start; here's the link to the most recent one:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz0yom/looking\_for\_group\_monday\_updated\_june\_10\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz0yom/looking_for_group_monday_updated_june_10_2019/)
---
I’ll be one shorting noobs in Ashenvale so I can get some petty wins and enjoy the beautiful music and scenery at the same time.
---
What's your point?
---
For solo, I always prefer Bite over Claw, because it's less likely to leave you out of focus when trying to use Growl.
---
Meet swampletics.
---
I just really want them to give he option of keeping or copying over our character to a classic+ account. We should have the best of both worlds so we never have to lose classic/vanilla wow and can enjoy new content (though I’d rather just have TBC).
---
They are harder than any dungeon in vanilla.
---
No changes isn't railing against QOL it's vehemently wanting the game to be what it was problem and all.
---
QOL can be great but blizzard has repeatedly thought certain world breaking or class breaking changes were QOL.  So let's leave the game as the original devs made it is the point.  Not that all QOL is bad.
---
You seem to think this sub hates QOL but I think it's more complicated.
---
Just implying no changes = hates QOL ends this conversation really.
---
You can run straight to Westfall. Just as you enter from Elwynn Forest there'll be a pair of farmers dishing out quests and one of them will direct you to the main hub/guy in the zone.
---
&gt;Thank you! What level do you recommend going to westfall? Or should I just go as soon as I complete ALL the quests in teldrassil? I think that’s about level 12.
---
That would be my recommendation. The moment you're finished with Teldrassil and are sent to Darkshore, instead of starting all the quests there just hop on a boat.
---
But if you want you could play with your filthy human friends even sooner, starting from Elwynn Forest/Goldshire rather than Westfall. In that case just do all the tutorial quests in Shadowglen and then run to Goldshire at level 6, skipping rest of Teldrassil.
---
Depends on what you want to do. Pally buffs are better for druid tanks. But war stomp is nice to have for pvp
---
Right...act what way? Disagreeing with someone? Speaking from authority? 
---
Spare me, go post on your main. Leeway existed in vanilla get over it :)
---
I do, because I prefer bite for solo.  I've found it much rarer I pull aggro off my pet if it has Bite, because Bite's cooldown leaves enough focus for Growl.
---
Why would I have to do that?  I've found if I have both, the game prioritizes Bite.
---
My wife and 2 children are going to put my dps @ -163
---
I mean... you can, it will just be less effective
---
LFM 9 more UBRS, MH/OH, ace of beast, skin and dagger res. Need key.
---
LMAO no... no SUPER no.  You get healer threat CONSTANTLY in Vanilla.  Don’t listen to this poster.  Take the talent.  You need it.

Maybe he’s Italian or Spanish

"this solution isn't perfect so let's just do nothing and have it many times worse..." - genius
---
Can't really agree, male human run animation is slightly off but NE and Dwarves are pretty good.
---
Thanks for the advice! Some of the youtube videos I am seeing show PvP paladins actually fucking people up, so I am getting mixed signals.
---
Also happy cake day.
---
Underrated comment
---
Watched the video. Correct me if I'm wrong, but they are just saying that skinning is not efficient and would be tough because your bag space fills up quickly. Leveling professions is never efficient so that's not a valid reason against skinning IMO. As for bag space, yes that will be a pain, but once you fill up on 6-8 slot bags early on, and sell grays and junk every time you're at a vendor, I don't think that will be a problem.
---
Huh, so has this changed since old WoW?
---
I never really played BGs when I gave BfA a go, but back when I played WoW in vanilla, Horde always had instant queues  and alliance had long ones in nearly every realm.
---
Do more people play Horde now?
---
Darkshore is a long and narrow zone with a lot of running time, it adds a lot to your leveling time. It also leads into Ashenvale which is a really bad leveling zone for Alliance because theres a pretty significant level gap from 18-21 where theres very few quests and a lot of Horde after that point. Conversely, Westfall is small, short run times, lead in quests to VC with great rewards, leadins to RRM and Duskwood, which are both good leveling zones.
---
Maury Povich should be able to help with that
---
There are tons of encounters in retail mages have to spell steal which is essentially same as dispel, so that mentality is a bit of a myth tbh.
---
Nah, layering is definitely worse. The only reason people think it's necessary is because they want to grind quests without any competition. If that benefit doesn't exist, then layering serves no purpose other than to harm the game.
---
* No to either. If you are pulling in a 5 man then just be careful not to HOT the tank prior to the pull or heal too soon. 
---
* Never used it myself, and never had a problem.

There is almost nobody left at Blizzard who has the classic sensibilities to design more content for it.  The taint of modern WoW has informed their design decisions for so long that new people don’t know how to design that content and the veterans are either on other projects or are why WoW became what it has anyway.  Preserving classic is easy, they have a template to follow, but do you trust the Blizzard who made BFA to make more classic content?  I sure as fuck don’t.
---
Hate to say it mate, but in a situation where your team loses no matter which side you are queuing from, the only constant is you.
---
Growing better facial hair?
---
To save the Druids/Bears?
---
&gt; Triprunner dungarees
---
Even for warriors. Thats 2% crit.
---
I've noticed on Retail that NE starting zone has much higher drop chance of bags than the other Alliance zones, is this the case in Classic?
---
man, you're missing out on half the classic experience. i feel bad for you but as long as you're happy i guess
---
Getting that key is such a pain in the ass
---
I used to and still play an alliance gnome mage with a handle bar moustache, my only tactic in PvP was to piss the horde off and I look forward to winding up 10 players so they all go for me just like the good old days.
---
I think it’s possible to define a philosophy and create with that in mind similar to the US constitution .
---
Now can they do this? Idk I believe they could..... will they. ? That’s another matter entirely
---
Yes they certainly exist and spawned from the Hunter's struggle with scaling.
---
I don't think they were ever really better but it does unlock a different playstyle of fire traps and arcane shots plus powerful aoe volleys.
---
Normal hunter rarely uses arcane shot because it shares cd with Aimed and is mana draining.
---
Well, the game doesn't come out for a couple months still, so it's not like they're really wasting time now by looking into valuable items to look out for.
---
You're right, gear becomes much more important toward endgame, but your advice almost comes off as if you're saying "don't worry about doing quests just do quests." Picking out a few relatively accessible quests (i.e., skip gnomer quests if you're horde but if you're a hunter, rogue, or druid, don't miss the Nesingwary chain) is a good idea and worth doing.
---
Design philosophy at Blizzard hasn’t changed over the 14 years that WoW has been out... management and shareholders have.  It doesn’t matter what design templates you set they’re going to cater to the lowest common denominator, introduce Blizzard Store mounts, pets, boosts etc and ruin “classic” not because that’s the design language but because it’s the insistence of those with real power.
---
Paladin because it's boring
---
Shaman because it's horde
---
Depends how quickly you kill stuff. You want as much gold/hour as possible.
---
In a 5man, if your tank is really bad, yes. Even then, if your DPS are decent, they should be trying to compensate by CCing or tanking it off you. Theres no way your pulling threat off a main target because theres 0 way youll get healer agro off a DPS.
---
In raids, as I said, its nigh useless, theres no way you should be getting healing threat on anything thats been tapped. Adds will always be tanked, AoE groups that arent tanked will have caster threat. The only time healers will get aggro is when theres no DPS or tanking threat on the target at all, and once again, 80% of healing threat is still greater than 0. Theres no situation where Subtlety is good in raids.
---
What?
---
No defense necessary.  Just twisted your narrative.  Sorry you felt the need to explain and demean your own comment.  I enjoyed it don't try to belittle the joke afterwards.
---
That's griefing, enjoy your ban
---
Imagine wasting all the potential money from cloth on bandages
---
First AIDS
---
true, but gotta get that WW weapon.
---
The game pace already was speeding up way to much not to mention what happened in WOTLK, the introduction of all new spells where 1.5, instant cast or up to 2.5 cast.
---
The world was permanitely shrunken after classic since each new "continent" was where everyone would exist per expansion
---
flying mounts in both wotlk and BC
---
Death knights began feeling less like units in wow and more like heros which took away from that rpg feeling.
---
Blood elfs and draenei felt completely out of place in lore.
---
I think those are really my main gripes. The gameplay in classic really is not compareable to to anything beyond it. "faster" does not equate to "funner"
---
The Diremaul exploting he is talking about is  by far the fastest way to farm gold. So he kinda has a point.
---
Yeah that’s why I’m saying in order for it to work they along with the community would have to set out a template of what makes classic tick. A set of commandment that must never be deviated from. Using that to go forward.
---
I’m not saying they should be trusted to I’m saying this is the only way it would work and I personally would love to see something like that
---
This. Shard farming really ain't a big deal, just something you have to be mindful of, like hunters and their ammo/food
---
Is there a "insert quality of life anything" in classic wow. If you are looking for easy life easy gameplay don't play classic. Next.
---
The best part is 10 levels later you see them LFM for a dungeon you also need. I made a lot of friends that way.
---
Another really cool dragon face for “Horde players in world pvp when I’m just trying to level”
---
Never played a Warlock in 13 years.
---
Huntard and retardin
---
You clearly haven't actually read how layering works. You are by no means going to be solo grinding quests. The benefit is that you will have a classic like number of competitors for mobs not an over hyped horde that would make killing quest mobs like Princess take hours.
---
&gt; 2-3 damage does matter, pre level 60 2-3 damage can be anywhere from 5-50% difference in damage for some mobs.
---
At level 1, yeah.
---
We had stress test 2 already though, the page says subject to change as well.  
---
I wouldn't be overly optimistic about this
---
I think you missed the point on how the vanilla experience will be ruined without it.
---
Any news on level increases? Want to run DM as much as possible.
---
The community has no fucking idea what it’s talking about because it’s not a singular voice.  Classic vs Classic+ is one example of this.  Cataclysm was the better one.  In Wrath the community had a large segment screaming for harder content and the return of CC in dungeons etc.  When Cata hit and it had that a new vocal group emerged to scream about the difficult of content and demand nerfs.
---
Nobody should be trusted to tinker with Classic.  Not Blizzard, not the Community, and certainly not the two in tandem.
---
I'm with this dude. If your healer is pulling threat... yikes! Good luck to any warlock or fury warrior in your raid that should be doing 4x any healer's threat. Only time a healer has to worry about threat is when adds are being picked up - but that is down to positioning and proper player awareness and ability usage, nothing really to do with the healer, and a few -threat talents won't help much if at all.
---
If you're asking what classes can PVP in the same gear they PVE in, that's pretty much every straight DPS class: Rogue, Mage, Warlock, Hunter, but they'll all still be gimped if they don't respec.
---
There is no class that can DPS and heal effectively in the same set of gear, in PVE or PVP.
---
You sound like you never played those expansions
---
&gt; They were in the actual game, right? I remember people popping them pre-raid.
---
The players who are obsessed with DPS meters and speed running raids aren't happy that Vanilla wasn't designed for min-maxing.  If world buffs (like the one that raiders get from the Onyxia raid) are in Classic the same as they were in Vanilla, then these players will have to spend a LOT more time preparing for their speed run raids.
---
technically priest.
---
Sure there is specific shadow damage gear and holy gear but there is a general "spells and damage" or something along that line that also affects both shadow and holy.
---
Alliance have an insane terrain advantage in AV, so it's pretty hard to believe horde would have a better winrate.
---
I played horde in vanilla and distinctly remember spending the majority of time getting wiped in that annoying ass chokepoint before the bridge.

let me know if you find this!

&gt; You can kite mobs, or gouge - bandage in pve.
---
You can do both without Improved Gouge as well.
---
Good job! I have no idea why you would get down voted for this. Does this also fix the hand-in quest minimap dot to a question mark?
---
Male only at the exception of a troll female shaman I mained during TBC.  I've actually main male human, night elf, blood elf, orc, panda, tauren currently undead. And the only female I've mained was troll. I leveled her during classic and then only mained her during TBC. Not sure why this has been the only female I had and why I did a female troll shaman in the first place. My first shaman ever created was a Tauren. Well that was boring lol. Hopefully it helped you fall asleep.
---
Are there places out there to look for a guild now? I've been playing since vanilla (with a few breaks) and am super stoked to play horde in classic. I never really got to raid much in vanilla so I'm looking forward to doing that but mainly I'm pumped for pvp. So where would I go to find a guild who will focus on both? I'd really like to look around and talk to people and find a good group before scrambling to do it while trying to level and get ahead of the pack on launch. I will be bringing a friend who's never played before and we plan on going lock and mage for the utilities they offer.
---
Because the first two are selected/edited content?
---
Real life everybody is shit. No such thing as one faction is better than other. Only in cases which a specific BG is unbalanced for some faction.
---
don't think it's going to be as hard as people are thinking. Private servers were tuned to be harder than classic, so I think a lot of people are going into this expecting a bigger challenge than it actually would be.
---
So i thought I was going crazy as I'm sure I remember crafting 4 per time. https://web.archive.org/web/20051226053641/http://www.thottbot.com/?sp=10140 shows you craft 4 per craft and according to the comments this was increased to 10 with patch 1.9. so I could be wrong but it definitely wasn't "spreading misinformation"... you make it sound so malicious
---
Classic Vanilla servers should stop at Naxx.  New servers can have TBC or (my preference) new Classic+ content/expansions.  The Vanilla servers should be preserved as they were and people can take a one-time character copy/transfer to the new C+/TBC realms.
---
"Trolling" if someone disagrees with you with video evidence. 
---
Right. Back to your main account
---
1 sample = proves!!!
---
As a tank I watch my healers mana bar, mainly as the current pack is dying to determine how quickly to go into the next. Sometimes all a healer needs is a couple seconds to eat. It’s not that hard for a tank to be aware by default. I don’t get it.
---
How does the new tier sets impact PvP? Have you considered that.
---
The Hinterland elite quests are AMAZING and give tons of great gear.
---
This means you immediately died to the alliance... wtf man. Wtf.
---
You get one of the best tanking trinkets up to AQ is obtained from a lvl45 Maraudon quest: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17774/mark-of-the-chosen
---
It is very very very VERY good.
---
[That stress test](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-29/181282)  was unplanned and added. I’d assume if it was cancelled they would announce it by now.
---
That's kind of the beauty of AV super geared players have no reason to do it. Just the noob 60s trying to get the epic rep gear. I think the fact that aside from rep it's meaningless makes it more meaningful while grinding the rep.
---
At the weekends I can probably play for long periods, like 8 hours or something in a row. Just don't have much time during the week.
---
- clear all content 
---
- get sulfuras as an enh shaman
---
I agree, it is good advice and I’ll definitely take it as I’ve only played vanilla on pservers, but you came off as narcissistic, and most people don’t like that.
---
THIS!!!  OMFG.  My tanks never stood and fought in the same place.   Almost every single fucking fight had to be a running battle that always kept moving forward.  Eventually I stopped dropping totems until I could run ahead of the group (if I could do it without pulling anything else), so hopefully 1 set of totems would be in range for most of the fight.
---
Only now? Damn they must be hurting worse than I thought.
---
That ring is pretty much BIS for druids up to Nef-ring. The main contended being Majordomo ring from MC:
---
As a tank, it’s simply not that hard to watch healer mana between pulls or even during. You can get a feel for burn rate after a few pulls and use that as a guide for the rest of the instance. It’s really not hard to be aware, without someone having to tell you. I don’t get it.
---
no matter how deeper this is drowning in down votes it's true.
---
it hasnt been fixed on live servers for a year now. ai pathing and combat bug  have been in legion for 2 years only to be fixed a few months before bfa release. and then bfa fucked it again. no fix this time.
---
so by now "we don't know if this will be the case at launch." is the equivalent of "thoughts and prayers".
---
so, wanna bet that this will be the case on launch?
---
Unfortunately 2000+ DKs is far too much of an investment to be satire in my opinion. Not only is it harder to get DKs to begin with but they come with a respawn timer to boot.
---
My friends and I are all in, too. We started a Horde guild at the launch of BFA, but we all know how the expansion ended up. If anyone else is playing Alliance solo, jump in with us! We plan to work on our pre-raid BiS &amp; PvP right after release, but we're not going to be too hardcore. 
---
If you're interested, join up: https://discord.gg/pedjhk3

I've sure made a lot of horde friends in Stranglethorn
---
Classic + would need go be in the same spirit of classic with attunements lots of grind. Lots of farm. Maybe some balance but keep the main roles for each class. Healers are always better as healer basically. You got to keep the RPG feel and its a very thin line. Alternatives specs are good the way they are some people will always enjoy playing the underdog. Or just solo farming or doing pvp with it then upload it to youtube. Wait shit, unbreakable are you there? lol
---
&gt; As MT, 99% of the wipes are because of other players
---
"It's not my fault the healer ran out of mana"?
---
You included a quote that explains why they decided not to add the ”Two. Lines!” to ”fix” it, yet you don’t understand why they didn’t ”fix” it...
---
Av isn't for Honor grinds, it's for rep grinding and quick av doesn't really speed it up as there are lots of ways to grind rep during an av.
---
19s is a shit bracket anyways, wouldn’t expect to see many premades at the level. During vanilla and TBC twink guilds were pretty popular and you could time the queues and go against other twinks. A premade of twinks against a pug would be overkill
---
Well im basing this off the time i raided with an alliance lock, with salv. Even with 16 debuff slots i wasnt able to cast corruption, so never got close to pull aggro. My comment was a jab at how warlocks are treated like welfare mages.
---
I called you out mr troll. Why you still tryin?

Please, that's a job for interns
---
When the old skill trees were removed in Cata, many of us knew that WoW was headed for the Easy Mode graveyard.  
---
The game just lost its magic after WOTLK ended and it was never the same again.
---
In my experience, during leveling, the other side always has the skull level advantage, doesn't matter if horde or alliance.
---

Don't know when it was put in, does it matter? That's how it was and that's how it is in Classic :)
---
Yeah fuck those Taurens, arrogantly minding their own business living on top of a rock on the other side of the ocean.

I recall re-learning spells, but that may have been when I specced into a tree that I hadn't specced into before.

Dude, deadmines... you got to leave early so you can do the questlines in time to get them on time for deadmines.
---
Get The Unstoppable Force and smack people with it while form shifting with my Druid. People never expect it and it can hit hard, great lulz back in the day
---
Guess who's to blame?

Only faction that has a unfair advantage are alliance. Easy example is AV
---
haaaaaaaaaa
---
I play whichever animations I like the most.

I can probably play 15-20 hours a week. At weekends I should be free to play most of the day and may be able to play an hour or so a day during the week. I've got no kids and will be writing up my PhD thesis and applying for jobs around the time wow classic releases so I want to keep the weekdays for work and weekends for chilling in wow. Hoping my SO will get into it as well since she only played WOW after MOP a little when I introduced her and never got to max level.
---
Oh how I wanted to make the same joke.
---
I'm going to say Pally/Lock just because it's such a weird combo.
---
For human - female.
---
Dwarf - male (female for caster).
---
Nelf - either
---
Gnome -- ewwww.
---
Orc - meh.
---
Tauren - male.
---
Troll - male.
---
Undead - female.
---
You might buy a grey/white weapon levels 1-12 or so. 
---
From there, when I played a melee class or hunter, I would occasionally buy an AH bow/gun/melee weapon in order to fill a dps void due to a lack of quest/dungeon weapon drops. 
---
Other than that, you really *shouldn't* if you want to be efficient with your gold. 
---
That said, melee classes should probably buy weapon upgrades if they haven't had any for a medium amount of time, since it'll increase how quickly you level.
---
Update: the question is for raids only
---
Agreed! It's even interesting that wow uses the terminology; some items are designated for "main hand" and "off hand" even though main hand and off hand always mean the same hand. So it's already baked into the game to easily have the option without items needing to say something different or additional.
---
Some raids will bring 1 Enh shaman to buff their best melee dps. 
---
Learn how to totem-weave and find a guild that'll bring you if you wanna Enh in endgame PvE
---
Yes, the question is in regards to raiding, you can do 5 mans blindfolded lol
---
Well, you could switch class instead of faction.
---
Thanks for the clarification. But did you enjoy the class or was the treatment too annoying?
---
Get'em
---
Apes have several streamers.
---
LW isn't worth it if you're gonna PvP, it's not that great.
---
Pve buffs for a tauren shaman are minimal, troll is probs best minmax pve. But if you plan to do any pvp at all, the orc stun resist will Trump everything.
---
I hear the Forsaken are working on one...
---
If you're a druid:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13966  trinket is from the long quest chain that culminates in killing general drakkisath.
---
The above trinket is Best in Slot mitigation trinket for Bear Tanking for ALL of Vanilla. No trinket comes close, nothing even in AQ40 or Naxx. You also have to give up the 2% Blackhands Breadth crit trinket in order to take it.
---
But if you have even the slightest desire to maybe try bear tanking at some point, go do that quest line and take the Mark of Tyranny and make sure you never accidentally delete, disenchant or sell it as it'll be your best bear friend forever.
---
This is exactly why I'm not bothering to take launch day off work

Am I the only one who knows that "turn" keys become "strafe" keys when you hold RMB?

At least you got 3 out of 4.

Solidarity from someone who was hoping to play a Shaman.
---
I need in on the name, dm please
---
You haven’t levelled many melee classes then. It’s a huge difference updating your weapon every 10 or so levels.
---
Stick with rust ;)
---
I mean it sorta makes since if you think about tokens. Also if subs are down how is world of Warcraft the biggest money maker for acticision-blizzard anyway?
---
I'm pretty sure level affecting your stats was only introduced in TBC.
---
So in classic it's always 59.5/1% no matter your level.
---
I think 11 weeks is the perfect amount of time personally
---
No Pandas, no MMORPG. Seriously thoigh... WoW never was and never will be rpg. No matter if vanilla or BFA unless it's rp server. But even then, the element of rpg is only when you actually roleplay. Quests have nothing to do with RPG, character creation has nothing to do with rpg, talent trees, no matter how good or bad designed are not an rpg aspect. WoW would be and some kind of rpg if choices your character make have an impact on your character storyline at worst. But it doesn't. You have no choices whatsoever, so stop with this rpg bullshit.
---
Was excited at first, but now meh. I still want to play it, but two months is a drag... Will likely be pretty excited again once the launch date gets closer.
---
I'm getting into other games at the moment though while I wait.
---
I'd like to report a murder.
---
The "One million subscribers" is referring to all the remaining players in BFA, not the actual reddit subs.
---
What's wrong with frost nova from a tank's perspective?
---
Night Elf druids can use shadow meld to drop threat.
---
To the OP, I recall healer threat (as a druid) was more of a problem in 5/10 mans than raids.
---
the only thing that should maybe be added is new areas/dungeons and raids and that 6 month to a year (or more) after their current content cycle ends
---
exactly.
---
Leveling and the outdoor world is still a lot harsher and unforgiving than retail has been for a long time. Raids, on the other hand, are probably going to be a cakewalk for people that are used to modern WoW raiding. Aside from the buff food and potion grind.
---
You don't get to gatekeep what a role-playing game is.
---
I would assume it is downvoted because he posted in his own post the blue post as to why they didn't fix it then also said "It would have been two lines for them to fix this. Two. Lines." Like his understanding of the reason is them being lazy.
---
Not a fan of Druids nor Shamans. Not too big a fan of Warlocks or Rogues either.
---
My go-to classes are Paladin and Mage.
---
Lots of good loot from the quests?
---
Depends if blizz will offer sex changes for classic. Pussy pass is real in mmos, so I could get loot as a chick I’d never get as a dude. But i do plan on leveling as a prot pally so that could be my one and only chick character.
---
First lvl 60 toon was a warrior.
---
That is laughably incorrect and just absurdly far from the truth. Twinks offer a different meta than level cap in PvP since the skills everyone has access to are different. At 19 rogues don't have colossal stunlocks. Twinking is about seeing just how far you can go about maximising the power of a low level character. SOME people just want to pubstomp on them, sure. But the majority want to fight other twinks because it can be really fun to play an alt that is absolutely decked out for it's level.

Maybe it's this https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/61727416.pdf
---
You must not have pushed very hard as a healer then. Shadowmeld is not very reliable and it doesn't drop your threat, it just takes you off the threat table for it's duration and all threat will be restored the moment you come out of it.
---
Orcs - Female

Sounds like quite a similar story to my own. I took my first long break from WoW during MoP. Lore, aesthetics and cannon meant a lot to me, and seeing Kung Fu Pandas in my World of Warcraft put a sour taste in my mouth. I hated them. 
---
But yeah, now that I’m older, I’m also firmly on Alliance. I, at some point down the road, may roll a horde shaman just my so I can enjoy some windfury fun. I played a shaman back in the days for a long time.
---
Only males I play are trolls. I love their voices and how they move, especially bow animation.

You're talking to a group that specifically doesn't want to talk about retail. They don't care about how twinks do in retail. They were talking claseic specifically.
---

---
No of course not, that would be retail type of stuff
---
Looks great!
---
tanks and healers are the priorities, DPS should know or learn mechanics to not die or over agro....and die. if a healer or tanks goes down then it is likely a wipe, if a DPS goes down then it'll just take a little bit longer.
---
gogogogolden retriever
---
If you can't generate more threat than a healer, who's spells only do half threat to begin with (and zero on overhealing), then you're a shit tank.
---
How would the reddit subs have access to sub numbers? Also given the fact that you can clearly see the Reddit sub has 1.1 members right under that, it referring to BfA subs and not the amount of Reddit subs seems unlikely.
---
When a player initiates this event, a server wide message is sent: "Eranikus, Tyrant of the Dream, has entered our world. Moonglade is in Peril." This was very unknown when it first came out and people didn't know what to expect as they flooded to Moonglade. Fun and chaotic in PVP servers

They had a choice to join Thralls Horde. They shall now pay with blood.

Now that we are talking about stress test, has anyone gotten an invite for stress test yet?

Vanilla was a long time ago and I could be misremembering about shadow meld... I should add that I never used it in raids so I'm not leaving the wrong impression here.
---
How can we play Classic right now?
---
Good call, thanks!
---
Please explain wtf you would call it? TPS? A racing game? What else could it be other than an rpg? RPG means “role playing game”, since this is a game when’re you’re playing a role, rpg sounds like all you can call it.
---
it's literally a human/orc chauffeuring you around [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Chauffeured\_Chopper#/media/File:Chauffeured\_Chopper\_Horde.jpg](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Chauffeured_Chopper#/media/File:Chauffeured_Chopper_Horde.jpg)
---
Imagine watching someone play sports you could play yourself. Also, we cant even play Classic yet.
---
Even in WotLK, Human racial was so broken that almost all good PvPers went to Human, unless you were playing Beastcleave
---
You can but keep a set for healing in your pocket. When you come close to 60 start building your set for the endgame and ofc at 60 respec for better resto
---
All of these are untrue, darkshore is an XP monster, full of quests that are located quite near each other. Ashenvale has loads of quests as well if you get all the darkshore prequests.
---
But don't take my word for it, go check Joana's leveling guide and see what zones he takes..
---
I think tranquility is pretty bad in vanilla I wouldn't talent it. It got a bigger range and way stronger in TBC where it became a really good 'oh shit' heal.
---
Number doesn't matter. What matters is fix of leveling pace
---
Yeah,  Malfurion taught Tauren the druid way.  In return,  they burn his tree.  So,  fuck those Tauren!
---
For real though. What's the actual reason the Alliance are so pissed at Thrall's horde. Deforestation of Ashenvale and defending themselves against Alliance aggression in Alterac Valley?
---
As a paladin the ring is probably the best reward huh?
---
Are you actually considering cross server play?
---
While tanks are gearing up, reducing healer threat will be important. Not do much when you have stuff on farm.
---
“I’m more valuable than you, therefore go and do the dirty work for... I mean, come here champion! It’s time for you to show us your... greatness or something. Look, just kill Gul’dan for me, ok?

Except thats not the issue. The issue is that the "work" youre supposed to do is unrelated to raiding, rewards not playing the game and makes the content less fun.
---
If the same system was in bfa and never in classic it would get so much shit from everyone here.
---
1. Level squish to 60 comes out in the next expansion (9.0) in a year.
---
2. Blizzard announces WoW 2 in two years.
---
3. All characters on both Classic and Retail are transferred over (with pretty much everything reset) and the new level cap is 70.
---
4. Blizzard gets those sweet microtransactions from both playerbases.
---
- Run all dungeons with my friends group
---
- T2 Shoulders/Chest/Helm
---
- Benediction
---
I hope they fix the number creep as well. The large numbers are confusing and I really don't like it.  Just trim some zeroes of the stats and damage.
---
I don't think their trying to disincentive players from playing WoW Classic I mean it's in there best interest to get everyone to play classic otherwise they wouldn't have bothered to put in the effort to create the servers. They have spoken about level squish before in live streams and interviews and this recent survey is the future state of the game so I don't think it has anything to do with WoW classic and their "play" is just trying to improve the game as a whole as they're well aware the game is trash for newcomers because if you're new to the game why would you bother trying to hang in there if it's so bad to get to endgame. 
---
A level squish is not enough of a core gameplay change to incentive the classic community to come back to retail because at the end of the day the game is still the exact same, it doesn't matter what number or system you have to identity your progression.
---
God no. It just seems odd that they crank up the level cap for so long and then will "drastically lower" (their words) it literally a month from classic launch. It's an odd decision.
---
Because no tank needs healing before 3 sunders on Onyxia /s
---
You have to consider that if you have faster queues so does everyone else on your faction making the grind harder since the competition also gets more honor
---
Yeah, but, first aid is actually a super reliable profession to have...
---
its not bad
---
Never did I think the Ghidorah meme would carry over to this reddit but here we are lol
---
if you're a mage celestial orb is way better, +3 int, 13 spell power and a use effect that gives you 400-1200 mana.
---
No doubt, it’s night and day.  Horde had a bit of an advantage with their original starting point. Used to think it was overrated then I went horde. Bridge choke point sucks dong.
---
It's risky. An immobilized enemy will attack anything in range, regardless of aggro. So if the tank moves an inch, mobs might turn and hit the melee dps. Tanks sometimes need to reposition slightly so all mobs are attacking them from the front (you can't parry or block attacks from behind). If mobs are frozen too far apart, it becomes impossible to tank the whole pack.
---
If a mage pulls aggro, sometimes they'll frost nova and run/blink away. That's bad because the tank has to go chase down that mob and bring the whole pack with him, getting hit from behind the whole time. It's more helpful to blink to the tank and then run past him to get out of melee range.
---
This
---
Thanks, Satan.
---
And we still see Night Elves Rogues, Troll Rogues doing just fine in raids. Get over it elitist jerk.
---
To be honest the biggest problem of hybrid dps isn't a class design but a set design. Druid's T2 and T3 are healing sets with agility. Paladin T1 and T2 sets have spirit, T1 and T3 are healing sets. It is hard to compete with other damage dealers when they (sometimes) have juicy set bonuses and your BiS gear has none of those. That's why people welcome the idea of post Naxx horizontal progression: no increase in item levels but new sets for different specs.
---
You can get all you need for a raid in ~15 minutes of efficient farming once you learn some decent spots. That's assuming your guild doesn't force you to summon and if it does, you should find a new guild.
---
Nope.
---
Fair enough \^\^
---
Hype always
---
If there's massive roster turnover, sure, they know the gear will stay in the guild. When only 2 epics per boss drop in a 40 man setting, you need to be pretty careful on who you assign it to. It fucking sucks if multiple pieces of epic gear per week get lost to turnover, especially in the early days when epics are scarce.
---
Good points. Wasn't aware that this was something they had previously discussed. It would be interesting though to have two wow games with the same cap (I personally don't think it will drop as low as 60; maybe 80).
---
Both are pretty hard to level tbh but if he wants to raid he's better off as a warrior. With a priest to heal him or a group levelling will be a breeze
---
You get one from casting drain soul on a target as it dies. So however long it takes to kill enough mobs. 
---
It’s time consuming but not crazy like some would suggest. I find the lack of bag space much more of an inconvenience than the time.
---
Yeah, but who brings a hunter for their dps? 
---
You'll be expected to run MM for TSA and bring a wolf to further buff your melees with the howl.
---
&gt; Characters having an identity in server / community 
---
Nah, [cross realm](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=731) is in Classic. 
---
2 out of 4.
---
no u
---
If you don't think Blizzard is cooking up some plan to convert Classic players over to Retail, you're delusional.
---
Imagine sitting around waiting for food to heal u and costing money when u could just use a bandage that u made with looted cloth that heals you 4 times faster.
---
GY camp til the day I die, fuck the flag.
---
1, the one.
---
How do I get to westfall?
---
On a private server with the original 1.12 client this might work, on the beta any conditional macro will not work as blizzard decided not to allow it. So this macro, with if and then statements will not work, nor will anything function as such
---
Lot of healing but I actually enjoyed that a fair bit personally.
---
Well this dilemma is also why vanila is the peak of wow; you have the ability to be the "outsider",  every spec and talent build is viable in raid, (top max dps is not needed, to clear a raid) skilled players is more important...  If you have 300 in cooking and fishing, and your primary profession is maxed out; there is ALOT more ways to help your guild by being nr 1 on the dmg meter, be a helpfull and happy paladin, then you will be raiding!
---
The Deeprun tram is based on what I did to your mother last night.
---
You massively underestimate the will power of Classic players. We/they fought for Classic for way too long to let it be taken away from us/them anytime soon. Classic will run for years and years and there will be hardly any changes to the core game. Change it and face the wrath of the Vanilla community. Even Blizzard should have understood this by know.
---
Is there a guide like this for warriors and their weapons?
---
It's just cross-realm BGs meaning you will not be able to group with people from other realms, so it will not affect PvE aspects - I'd say more like 2.5 out of 4 than straight-up 2 out of 4. : P
---
There wont likely be an effect on either of those playerbases, classic players don't like classic because it's level 60, they like it because of the different ideology involved behind the game design, and the same can probably be said for people who are on retail and don't want to try classic, they're simply two different games. 
---
As for the chances it goes to 60, that seems unlikely Eastern Kingdoms/Kalimdor are simply too large to make them only worth 10-20 levels in my opinion. I guess it's possible but would require a massive gutting of quests to do, so such that a zone (say The Barrens) would have to only give 1 level, if not then most of EK/Kal would be mostly wasted space. They could always do another Cataclysm event to even it all out, I don't know how likely any scenario is though.
---
I would say that applies up until AQ, something like Twin Emperors might pose a challenge.
---
It essentially means as what was to been shown/demonstrated.
---
I make a statement about how the guild would be a toxic place to be and you instantly try insinuate that I am somehow socially insular or don't enjoy socialising. 
---
You essentially proved my point for me, this 'classic community' is so eager to throw shade for no reason. It is just sad.
---

---
The orb is useful to switch in on long fights for mana.
---
How high did your mom drop you when you were a baby?
---
They did that in AQ  not MC.
---
Changing a file in the game so you could move true a wall. Falling straight into the final room before C'thun.
---
While I agree with you that classic servers should remain pure, splitting the game in 3 will damage the communities as everyone has his own preferences. 
---
IMO there should only be Classic+ and not TBC. We already know where the TBC pad will lead us to. I would rather explore new C+ content than repeat history.
---
This has already been done once before so imagine how bad it used to be.
---
Outdoor content is significantly more difficult than in Retail. Pulling two mobs can result in your death quite easily, and murlocs as an example usually alert all of their friends nearby. They are a pain in the ass.
---
I suggest MadSeasonShow if you havent checked it out yet
---
I'd like to make a /s comment about sitting in queue and getting chain dc'd for 2 hours, but I already know I'll sit there and do it again anyway.
---
Wtf? Even Pokemon is a role playing game and doesn't have any RP servers and doesn't even have a chat. And it's a linera game, where you play the same story over and over again. You don't even make any choices. And it's called an RPG game.
---
RPG is about taking a character and playing with him as if it were you. You take on the role of the character and play the game.
---
Because then all three dragons are the right-sided one...
---
don't forget a stylish tuxedo for your bank alt.
---
can you elaborate what new things you mean?
---
Thinning out talent points so they weren’t every level was fine and plenty scalable indefinitely. Expansions don’t need to add 10 levels to the cap, either.
---
you tell us bro
---
&gt; face the wrath of the Vanilla community
---
lol, like the community has any power over Blizzard.
---
If Blizzard wants to take down all the Classic servers when what is effectively 10.0 launches, they will, and if you get free transfers over to 10.0 and it doesn't smell like Retail because of the level squish and other changes, it will pick up many Classic players.
---
I do that too. I like turning on WASD, it means if I'm really lazy particularly when levelling. I can play with just my left hand with tab targetting. Then if needed I can use mouse to strafe.
---
Am not as hype now since I’m just looking forward to the Shadowbringers expansion for FFXIV.
---
Shaman only gets 3 for TBC viability??? Shamans were the bees knees in TBC.
---
The biggest problem I find is there's a lot of people on youtube giving "advice" or producing content about things they very clearly don't have a complete understanding of. There's to few content creators with sufficient actual experience of vanilla/private servers to produce good content and it makes finding good stuff more difficult. Christ I saw something where a guy said the 30% rage decay talent for warriors was shit the other day, couldn't believe it.
---
Well, a roleplaying game where you don't roleplay...
---
Sure, if you want. I've better things to do than argue about that, like playing a good FPS like Crusader Kings II or maybe some MOBA like Super Mario.
---
The only horde male I can do is Tauren. I hate the horde hunch to much to play any other horde race as anything but female. 
---
Interestingly enough almost all of my characters have been horde.
---
I wouldn't worry about scrambling to get ahead of the pack at launch, if you have memories of classic you'll know how much slower paced gearing generally is, especially when you take into account the different phase releases of content. You will only have like 5 max level dungeons to get gear from at launch and some of them are a single instance split into 2 (Strat/BRS), you will also have a few months to get it too before the first raid is even launched so you'll have plenty time to get yourself sorted on launch and scope out guilds.
---
Hell as a mage some of your raid BiS is dungeon blues so you don't even need much loot from the first raid (Your absolute BiS wand is actually a world drop green believe it or not)
---
Will dire maul tribute runs work on a hunter in classic?
---
Its the truth. Its the wow circle of life, payback for all the blood sweat and tears of being a lowbie
---
It's a MMO hack'n slash, just like Diablo III.
---
I only roll female and I’m a dude my girlfriend thinks it’s weird but fuck it yolo
---
Wonder if reserving items will be a thing on Classic WoW.
---
It happens on private servers but it's generally frowned upon, will be interesting to see how people will react on release.
---
UBRS is a beast dungeon btw, farm your truestrike shoulders, dal'rends, briarwood reeds, tank shield and more! We'll be spending a lot of time in there.
---
Hunter. And pretty much for exactly the same reason as you.
---
&gt; RPG is about taking a character and playing with him as if it were you. You take on the role of the character and play the game.
---
And most people don't do that in WoW, except in RP servers and even there it's not a majority.
---
The community does not have any power over Blizzard? Dude, how do you think Classic came to pass in the first place? Who made it happen, even though J. Allen Brack himself told us that it will never happen? It was the community, no one else. Your mindset is exactly what made the game industry so bad in the recent years, because people like you make the industry think they can serve us whatever dish they please. This may well be the case for you, but not for hundreds of thousands of gamers who fought for Classic. Never underestimate your power, no matter of you are an individual or part of a strong community. Otherwise nothing good will happen ever.
---
Rather than already well known figures in community (streamers, duh)  I am more excited to meet normal people on server I am going to play who will make name for themself and for me to remember.
---
The best weapon for pvp before naxx is generally considered to be Dark Edge of Insanity (AQ40).
---
Anyway, if you're actually a 2H fury warrior you should have priority over other warriors who just want a pvp weapon.
---
Print screen my man.
---
You're in a massive world with other players and you play a role in that world. That is an MMORPG.
---
Do you dress up like your favorite character every time you play a singleplayer RPG, or do you not consider those RPGs either?
---
You don't have to invent your own silly RP for WoW to be an RPG. Every quest you do, every dialogue box you click, every boss you kill, that's you playing a role.
---
Ok :) Zetox btw
---
I see you have all the right /emote macros
---
/train
---
Alright I’m with you on everyone  but NElf male. Really don’t know how any does it. Don’t know how I leveled 2 separate NElf males to max (60, and 70 respectively). I guess front flips while jumping is pretty cool.
---
Blizzard made Classic happen. They made the decision, not the players. You didn't fight for anything. You begged, they said no, they finally ran the numbers, and decided to give it a shot. If it fails or if they come up with better numbers, you'll go back to begging and they'll go back to saying no.
---
Don’t sway me now, I mained shaman from wotlk on and it’s hard not to play the class in classic. But I don’t want to heal this time.
---
Yes you'll have to relearn ranks of talented spells, shamans have had to completely relevel weapon skills for 2-h at points during Vanilla (May have been changed during Vanilla, I can't quite remember)
---
Well I play for the PvP and never done a raid in my life, many ways to play the game
---
Dont forget nightfall, 2-h axe with a proc that increases spell damage taken by 10%. It's an easy way for an enhancement to secure a spot.
---
 If you intend on aoeing, the only things that matter are stam and intel, sp barely affects blizzard.
---
Even if it were necessary to help people out with buffs and heals in retail wow (it's not - dying is virtually impossible), the chances of bumping in to that person again later on down the road are virtually zero thanks to sharding/phasing.
---
You have the beta and the AV test access, and you have the nerve to complain about ANYTHING going on in it?  I would literally FUCK my dad to have EITHER
---
How can a satire post be so relatable
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was the only non-engineering ranged pull they had.
---
They came through the portal and looked different.
---
Excuse me. Moonglade would like a word.
---
Mage is a bc class in classic, it is basicly the only class that can be good, at everything, and you can argue even best sometimes.
---
Shit I guess every single MMORPG out there is not an actual RPG. It's almost like RPGs aren't games where you actively roleplay stuff.
---
No news but I think it's unlikely they'll make us keep levelling to 10 over and over.
---
Mage and hunter will kite them quite well it's just something the enha needs to play around, don't just run up in their field of view expecting them to let you get close. You approach from the rear and hope you get the WF on your stormstrike then can finish them off with Frost shock. It's a gamble but Shamans are great against all other melee and people who can't kite so there's that (You can also get yourself free action pots if you're a baller and chase anyone in ghost wolf)
---
I think I’m finally tapering off, just getting ready for release. The hype is at an all time high but I kinda cannot stand the content right now, unless it’s from one of the original developers. There are only so many times you can listen to Esfand talk about the good days. God I can’t wait to level in Mulgore again.
---
Literally this. The Horde that was still aggressive to the Alliance were in Blackrock Mountain. Instead they decided to cross an entire ocean to start killing cow people they've never met before because they were hanging out with some Orcs.
---
Enhancement gets taken for totems for any melee groups and also for the nightfall debuff that increases magic damage taken by 10%
---
You'll be a very gimped healer if you limit yourself to just damage &amp; healing gear - but yes technically you could do it.
---
I am for classic+ but i am all for nochanges to classbalance because it is one of the mainreasons what classic is for me.  Instead I would like to see some kind of T3,5 drop in higher raids than naxx for all classes and speccs that for example could give a prot paladin a taunt ability as setbonus, higher manareg for balance druids etc. so that memespeccs can shine.
---
The RP in RPG doesn't mean rocket-propelled.
---
Usuallby because people play with friends and lvl together. When I am lvling druid, I like doing NE zones.
---
What bosses require resistance and how much resistance? 
---
After researching, I can't find an answer on this topic. I'm curious to know which bosses in raids need resistance gear and which don't, and how to know which ones do/don't
---
I'm aware of Rag needing Fire Resistance gear, but unsure of how much. But what about other bosses? Is it safe to assume all bosses in MC will require FR gear, all bosses in AQ require NR gear?
---
same same :)
---
Looks like there is hazardous abandonment on the beta. Players reported their pet losing both name and spells.
---
my favourite names so far:
---
= IMP =
---
.bizbis
---
.gothic
---
.tarrot
---
= VOID =
---
helloz
---
What do you mean 12 hours? Lol.
---
I personally hit 120 between 7-8 AM. Gingi was about 2,5-3 hours faster and I for sure wasnt the second 120.
---
The horde pretty much have the best PvP racials so if you want to PvP then you are probably inclined to go horde. There are some ally race outliers that are good for PvP but it's pretty weighted to the horde so this throws off the player balance.
---
Fuckin greenskins comin ere and takin our loot
---
who cares
---
Hi pretty sure it was the only non-engineering ranged pull they had., I'm dad.
---
So did I!
---
How do you play a role ?
---
Because that's where we disagree.
---
I'm hoping Blizz is planning to start from scratch with the classic model while keeping every legacy version on their own servers. That way anyone who wants to play legacy versions can just jump right on in.
---
Lmao the dude asks a question and cops shit for not knowing the answer!
---
Sure. It’s just not reasonable. You need good gear and a lot of consumables. Every death or mistake is a massive setback. The biggest thing with WoW is there is SO MUCH TO DO. Grinding one thing over and over is counter intuitive.
---
Then roll a warlock, problem solved.
---
Better combo for what? Pala/Warr is more desired/better than Pala/Lock for both dungeons and organized PvP. The only advantage Lock has over warrior is convenience in finding a raid spot.
---
They would never have made it happen if the oh so powerless community hadn't fought for it. Of course the made the final product, of course they will earn money running the servers, but Classic would never have happened if players didn't have any interest. So what you're saying makes no sense. Classic sure can exist without me, but I'm part of the community. And if you say Classic can exist without the community you have never really looked into the core of game industry in your life. 
---
You think I hold zero power. Do you also think you hold zero power yourself? Why do you think people go vote, then? Why do you think people like Martin Luther King had power? Why do you think teens love Miley Cyrus? Yes, those examples might be a bit far-fetched, but every individual holds power, if you like it or not. 
---
Let's set a reminder and see how this turned out. In two years from now, I say, Classic will be basically unchanged from 1.13. !RemindMe in 2 years
---
Are the pserver neckbeards made for the welfare system or is the welfare system made for the neckbeards?  :thinking:
---
Not bad at all if you are alliance make sure to go to raven hill and farm the ghosts using detect invisibility.
---
I can usually get 40+ in 10-15 minutes
---
It doesn't matter if we disagree on what playing a role constitutes. In relevant terms, WoW has always been and will always be an RPG.
---
if you think they will release TBC servers with the gates closed (again) that not going to happen, they specificly made new servers start with the gates open after the large amount of people transfering at 70-80 to hand in the quest.
---
gAmErs RiSe uP
---
The delusion of some of the wow players never cease to amaze me
---
Grinding for mats and leveling up professions is one big thing that makes classic fun for me. Can't wait!
---
Still more raid DPS to have a cat than a wolf. Howl hitting all melees+hunter doesn't beat a cat's DPS. There's no point in gimping your own DPS *and* the overall raid DPS just so the melees can do a bit more damage.
---
It probably won't be that bad in Classic. It was bad with 8 debuff slots because you effectively couldn't get a drain soul off in raids on trashmobs with how low-prio the debuff was. That won't be an issue at all with 16. farming up 4x16 slot bags doesn't take long in a group.
---
You know you can keep your Classic servers forever while the game continues to get expansions right?
---
No reason to shoehorn everyone down the same path. Lots of us want TBC, and future expansions as long as the classic model is preserved.
---
Well, no, since you don't play a role.
---

---
The won’t release it.
---
Blizzard wins at the end of the day - and I’m due they tell their investors the actual sub count after classic releases.
---
But blizzard has pride - they aren’t going to admit Classic was a bigger success than BFA
---
On privat server it where the case, so i cant see why it shouldnt be on retail servers, maybe not on all but i can see it beeing done.
---
If you rly only want to do rank 10 and go mc , you should maybe think about priest, a UD Shadowpriest with Anathema and rank 10 is mostlikely the strongst class you class you can play with this  gear overall.
---
But how am I supposed to go off on my knights-in-shining-armor-complex with a dude who wears loincloth and places little wooden voodoo statues? Sorry sir, no-can-do.
---
We don't think they are difficult. Vanilla dungeons are just even easier than that.
---
Again, if Blizzard decides to shut down Classic after figuring out what they think is a viable way to convert those players over to Retail, you will be completely and utterly powerless. Business is not a democracy. Blizzard does what *it* wants in the interest of its shareholders. Just because you give them ~$180 per year does not make you worth their time.
---
I think it's just a happy coincidence. A level squish has been in the talks for years behind closed doors I'd imagine, they only recently started openly talking about it to ease the idea out into the public. Classic has also been in the works for the past \~2 years, it's likely just something that happened to line up but works out nicely for both crowds. Hopefully.
---
It is troubling seeing them nerf more methods of powerleveling, with the freehold/isle expedition nerfs...
---
Because by his point we shouldn't speculate things that are unannounced. There was no evidence for many years that many things wouldn't happen that did, such as this very game. It's a negative, passive aggressive post that is now a deleted post.
---
I mean, I fully get *why* they were fighting the horde in the good ol' WC 1 and 2 days. With the demon blood and all. But post WC3 days, the blood curse has been cleansed, Thrall's Horde helped defend the World Tree at Hyjal from Archimonde. 
---
The Alliance are nearly always the aggressors, atleast as far as vanilla wow goes. I like how it's for somewhat realistic reasons, mainly about resource control in a world still recovering from near-annihilation, but the Alliance really are dicks half of the time. Mostly because the orcs were dicks to begin with.
---
From a PvE kitty druid perspective alliance are the better faction due to Paladin buffs (The big shaman buff WF, doesn't affect kitty's) kitty druid basically requires powershifting to be acceptable (Shapeshifting between caster and kitty form repeatedly to proc the Furor talent and a helm "Wolfshead helm" passive giving 60 total energy every shapeshift) this becomes expensive on mana so BoW and BoK help this by increasing mana regen/max mana pool respectively. They also gain AP from both str and agi, BoK is a % gain rather than static so BoK tends to give druids more gains.
---
If you're resto or tank then the differences are much more subtle. (Sorry Boomies, you basically don't exist and I don't have enough knowledge to fight your corner here)
---
You can argue definitions all you want, I'm not going to bother with a troll.
---
I'll probably get downvoted but I would love the legion class design in classic. All of the classes I played in legion were fun and engaging even though the game was average.
---
Definitely mage, with just frostbolt, blink and frost nova you can help control enemies and keep yourself safe
---
judging justice does nothing in vanilla in pvp. The speed limiting effect was introduced in WotLk. In vanilla it merely prevents a mob from fleeing.
---
Weather or not the person actively plays as their character they are invested in the toon. Thay is what is at the core of an RPG. They are playing a role, not acting out one. Otherwise we might as call it a LAMMORPG
---
Clearly you don't know the Vanilla community and have never been part of it. Veteran Vanilla players won't accept Retail, no matter the disguise you put it in. They'd rather not play the game at all than play an abomination of what their favorite game has become.
---
Nightelves view Grommash as a monster for slaying Cenarius while the orcs view him as a hero for freeing them from their blood curse.

Humans and Dwarves mostly view Thralls horde as being no different from the previous Horde ruled by Doomhammer in the second war, though some know there is a difference (Jaina and some of the soldiers from Theramore)  
---
Furthermore the Alliance have a hard time seeing the Forsaken as being different from the Scourge other than having a different banner.
---
Restos buff the melee, too. No real need for Enh but you can still convince your guild to go for it.
---
What if they increased the level cap by two levels for the next set of content. Adjust it so Naxx gear is viable starting gear for the next tier of raiding.
---
Encourage guilds to level up and go to naxx to prepare for the next tier. Possibly add a quest for naxx to get access to the new raids. Two levels would shift the power but would not need to be enough to trivialize all the old content.
---
While getting two levels would be trivial, more stuff would shift to faction rewards. That feels like classic wow.
---
The only way you don't play a role in World of Warcraft is by not logging on. If you put something up on the Auction House, you played a role. If you complete a quest, you played a role. If you attack a member of the opposite faction, you played a role. If you sit in Barrens and talk about politics, you played a role.
---
Even though you're some college dropout living in a basement that gets spoon fed responsibilities by your ever-tiring parents, you play a role in society. Just by posting here, you're playing a role.
---
If you don't understand that, it's probably because you have ~2 more months before your first day of high school.
---
I'm a Veteran Vanilla player and if Retail changed enough and reset everything, I'd absolutely play it over Classic.
---
Clearly you don't speak for everyone.
---
&gt;As for healer, also at the start, I say that I will pull when I consider that he have enough mana. There are pulls that require 20% mana, and pulls that require 70% mana. 
---
Healers will hate you if you keep pulling when they are not full mana. You are wasting their water if you pull while they are still drinking and not full mana. Water expenses add up fast.
---
Right, but I guess you don't, either.
---
On pservers they did if it died
---
Winding people up is so much fun. And it's memorable for both players.
---
As a longtime rogue player, just CCing for days is the best thing. At worst, I'm trading 1 for 1 while my team 9v9s, so if I can do it on a healer or key dps, life is good.
---
Female. Something about looking at a guys ass for a few hundred hours just doesn't sit well.
---
Off the top of my head:
---
Geddon, some trash packs and Ragnaros require *the tank* to have fire resistance gear. The raid doesn't need FR as long as they're using Greater Fire Protection Potions on Rag.
---
Not too sure about BWL, you might want some fire resist on firemaw on your tanks, as well as Onyxia Scale Cloaks for the 3 drakes (tanks only) +nef (everyone in the raid).
---
Nature resist for your melee/hunter soakers on Huhuran in AQ40. It doesn't hurt to run some nature resist on Viscidus either. 2 locks with a shadow resist set to tank the Twin Emps.
---
In Naxx, you only really want frost resist for Sapphiron, and it can help for KT as well. Just don't fall in the noob trap that Shadow Resist on Loatheb is good. It isn't, and will screw you over. You want all the damage you can on that fight.
---
More like alliance mate
---
.... Horde always win the bgs 
---
Alliance only ever win the 40 man ones.
---
Like AV
---
Blast Wave doesn't knock back in Classic, so as long's you've got enough threat they should be fine to use it.
---
If only many can do that so I can play.
---
It won't be in Blizzard's best interest to further split the playerbase. Support Retail and Classic and whatever happens after Classic? No.
---
They'll keep pumping out the content they already have without any need beyond getting it working on the modern engine until they figure out a way to convert at least half the Classic playerbase over to Retail.
---
They won't spend a single dime on Classic more than they have to. If TBC comes out, they'll push all realms to it and they MIGHT open up one or two Vanilla-only realms for the diehards to transfer over to and be ignored forever.
---
Hunter. I've always tried other classes on expansion releases but always ended up back on my hunter. I kinda like the "huntard" reputation they had in classic and the opportunity I get to change peoples viewpoint, one dungeon at a time. Also love the rpg-element of having a pet and training it, feeding it and having to buy arrows.
---
I'm reading about the AQ event: [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gates\_of\_Ahn'Qiraj](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gates_of_Ahn'Qiraj)
---
Holy shit it's so epic and grand in scale, I cannot even imagine how this must have been.
---
Let's continue this discussion in two years and see if WoW 2 has been announced and Blizzard want to convert Classic players over to Retail. Looking forward to it!
---
(underbear :o )
---
I don't have to. The only voice that matters is Blizzard's. They're going to do whatever is in their best interest. Not yours, not mine.
---
For them Vanilla will be just another private server rush with bigger audience.
---
&gt; but also wanna pick ***based on pvp combo*** at 60.
---
Uhh...
---
Yes. The "Play" button is grayed out. When I mouse over it, it says "You can't play WoW Classic yet."
---
Pancakes made with Ionic trace minerals are absolutely terrible.
---
Ah very cool, I missed that post sorry. That's good news for all involved then!
---
I don't understand it looks the same.
---
I'm rolling a mage first just so I can do this and other farming. Once I get my economy under control, then I will roll my healer.
---
My first main was a healer. It took me way too long to level a farming character so I am doing that first this time.
---
That was never the point of this whole conversation.
---
It's all subs. They will have plenty of players for each version to have healthy servers.
---
Yes I do.
---
Which also has rpg elements like leveling up, skills, a story. It’s literally an rpg. Hell Zelda games a technically an rpg since you’re playing the role of link. RPG is more broad than you think
---
You don’t have to act like the character, you interact in the story through that character. I think most people agree that levels and character development aspects (stats, skills) make it an RPG.
---
So stoked about classicwow I now wake up dreaming about class selection..   
---
My Dwarven Priest looked like a holy glowing Twi'lek in TBC dungeon 3 armor, but thats besides the point. ( I don't even really know anything about star wars, lol.. No idea where that came from )  
---
My hunter was human too, which isn't even a thing in classic.  
---
Dreams say priest/hunter  
---
I'm not even this stoked for Mount &amp; Blade Bannerlord and Animal crossing and they're amongst my favorite game series of all time.
---
Aye. I'm from Lordaeron and I say, kill em all!
---
This made me start on lights hope and I’m having a blast. 
---
My impatience is killing me
---
You obviously since you have more than 1 reddit account and you use them to feign support for your psycho babbling about vanilla mechanics that you don't think existed but did. 
---
You responded to my friend in this thread on accident with your alt account. 
---
Shit is weird and pathetic, you're going to play vanilla NO MATTER WHAT when it comes out so just relax and quit spending all day attacking people on reddit. 
---
Bye
---
Nothing ever costs practically nothing.
---
And they don't just want subs, microtransactions are over half their revenue. Retail has tons, Classic has none.
---
the male night elf
---
Zelda is usually not classified as an RPG, but as an action/adventure.    
---
I'm not the only one saying that, it's in the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda
---
No, the point was you thinking that if Blizzard decides to shut down Classic, you and your community could somehow stop them. You think you have power. You really really don't.
---
I do that as well (but I also played a healer for most of my wow time). And then you have
---
Not racism
---
Really cool video editing. Tell me which server you going and I fuck you up later tho, Jk.
---
I assume your rule is for full blue dungeon gear or worse, right? Otherwise you are just a silly banana
---
Totally wrong.
---
Do you have to be subbed to get the invite?
---
Thanks! Haha, yeah hopefully they release servernames soon.
---
While not bad, it's not natural. Games are developed from scratch, every part of content is meant to be seen, played, walked through. By skipping a lot of stuff, you cut off a huge amount of content. Then you brag about how easy this or that is, how there is nothing to do in MMORPG. I have been there many times and heard those opinions. People tend to shit on MMORPG content like there is no tomorrow while not playing it through. It annoys hell out of me.
---
Is there anyway to make a feral druid spec viable WITHOUT a manual crowd pummeler?
---
Morally wise no but you realize they need that ambush otherwise it would be one of the worst classes to play.
---
Press Ctrl+P if you really need a paper copy. But to print it all out would probably be more expensive than just buying a cheap second monitor.
---
I don't think this'll be much of a problem to be fair, many people will probably go into classic with vague memories or a blank slate and learn from there.  
---
Either way general experience will exceed what original classic players had, you can already see the classic was really hard memories being dispelled in current content - I think realization will hit the hardest when people hit the first raids.
---
Yes it was harder, and we had to group for things, but It's not like we're playing dark souls blind with a single life here.
---
I want to agree with you.. But mmorpg and rpg are very different things
---
Y-yeah. Ele/resto either as 31/0/20 for increased control of your burst or 30/0/21 for more versatility and survivability totally isn't an utterly insanely good PvP spec that both heals, does respectable damage and supports your team very well.
---
Enhancement gud.
---
yes you need to have an active subscription
---
Fantasy Casino ofc
---
Do resto druids roll on healing cloth gear or does intellect leather drop for them in raids?
---
It was a joke..
---
Not 20 /played if that is what you mean. Most people do it in 10. Some in 4-6.
---
What about TBC?
---
If I have mage water, I'll take a sip everytime I get out of combat. But if I have to pay for that sweet nectar, I'll be more consevative with the black hole for gold. You can easily make a sizeable net loss in a dungeon if you waste your drinks like that.
---
Ment what my girlfriend said =)
---
Almost everyone who heals or DPS' will end up wearing some off armour pieces, even holy pally's where dresses
---
Rofl
---
Shaman is the 3rd least populated class in retail (only Monk and Demon Hunter, new classes, are below) and it has always been like that since vanilla.
---
Retail is also failing. Sub numbers are in the shitter.
---
All players more skilled than oneself are cheating, all players less skilled than oneself are noobs. Or so the BG chat tells me.
---
Viability is relative to your goals. If you want to feral, you will likely want to be doing it before not after you get it. Will you beat warriors and rogues? No? Does it matter if you aren't racing? No
---
He has a upgraded version for 1.12.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/horde-1-12-durotar.html
---
That's the durotar starting zone. Scroll to the end and chose next part. Just print pages
---
One i get a new thing about classic i wanna find out i research hard on it for hours end. And were still this far away, it sucks lol
---
i'd love for more ooga gang copycats to show up on various servers.
---
He's somewhat deep in ret too, given that he has SoC and Eye For An Eye.
---
Phase 1 - Level to 60 ASAP, level up engineering, clear MC.
---
Phase 2 - Grind world pvp for highest rank I can get. Prepare 19/29/29 twinks. Maybe level an alt.
---
Phase 3 - Clear BWL. Play lots of twinks.
---
Phase 4 - Clear AQ.
---
Phase 5 - Clear ZG.
---
Phase 6 - Clear Naxx.
---
I think people overhype classic a bit imo. Once we're into it, I will just be logging into raid if I feel like it. First phases will be fun though.
---
Why oh why? That doesn't make much sense, that a paladin with stature should have to wear a dress...
---
You need to go pshhh around the corner.
---
My brother and I when we started WoW wanted to find the fastest way to level 10, no matter how or anything, my fastest was one hour, and I could only do it in the NE zone, our averages there were usually 6ish.
---
Uh did you respond to the right person? My complaint was simply a lot of content produces don't know shit about what they're talking about so it's hard to find good accurate content atm.
---
You can also do this with weakauras
---
Have fun with lvl 45 water until Dire Maul is released ...
---
## Horizontal Progression through Set Bonuses
---
If there was new content added to Classic eventually, set bonuses could be an incentive to complete new dungeon/raid content. Players would have the option to look different through new tier sets.
---
If there were new dungeons and  T1, T2, T3 raids that dropped gear with new set bonuses, would that allow for enough customization? Some of the Molten Core sets offer pretty good set bonuses, and I wonder if set bonuses could be a way to offset the stat increases that T3 gear offers for example. If there was new Tier 2 raid similar to Blackwing Lair, it could drop new set bonuses that changed the way certain talents worked. (ex. T2 mage set Spellweave Regalia  (5) Set Bonus Tier %chance Pyroblast hits multiple targets.  Tier 2 rogue set with a 5 piece set bonus that gives bonus % to a talent. Like 20% increased Master of Deception talent so you have better stealth. Gear set bonuses could we a way for players to enhance their talents and create new talent specs. Imagine if ret paladins could boost the effectiveness of the Retribution tree through raid gear set bonuses. If you change the talent trees, you risk homogenizing the classes. The issues with the vertical raid progression is that if attribute increases are all that matter, then higher tier drop gear is clearly better.
---
Naxxramas gear should remain top end. Adding new raids that increase the tier level beyond 3 creates problematic power creep. The solution is perhaps to add special set bonuses to gear from new raids, as well as bonuses that aren't just attribute differences. You have to create itemization that makes doing all the raid contet worth it, but at the same time doesn't invalidate the other raids. The issue of gear inflation is also something to consider. If you have 10-15 raids to choose from, then it could make it much easier to just stock up on epics. If the itemization is good enough that real character customization exists from collecting different raid tiers, then it could be ok. New on-use trinkets, ring set bonuses, etc.. as well
---
You wanna know one of the reasons we ended up with the expansions? Because players were too busy posting #nochanges Blizzard-can-do-no-wrong lunacy on the WoW forums back in day. Instead of constructivy discussing the future of the WoW, players were sidetracked by nonsense.
---
I understand Classic will be #nochanges, but there are a lot of knowledgable and erudite posters here who might have solutions to advance the original game if and when thst times comes. Sure Blizzard might just drop #nochanges TBC on us, but at that point I'll be out.
---
## New Quests, Collectables, and Leveling Zones
---
Improving the leveling, quest, and farming experience in Classic WoW is something that new content patches could focus on. Have new questlines and storymodes for leveling zones. For every raid patch, there could be a patch that enhances other aspects of the game. Never underestimate how popular cosmetic/collectables are. There should be new mounts, recipes, etc.. that you can farm in post-naxx raids/dungeons/questlines. They probably keep BFA alive. Then of course improving the PvP system is also very important. Making World PvP a bigger aspect of Classic WoW.
---
## Player Housing
---
This isn't a priority really, but Blizzard originally intended to make player housing. I think having players or guild housing in certain parts of the world could work.
---
## World PvP System
---
Instead of adding Arena to Classic WoW, add a new system where players players can viably rank up through World PvP. A huge flaw with Classic WoW is how battlegrounds become the main focus of PvP. You can't really rank up doing World PvP once battlegrounds are released. They need to either create a separate honor system where you only rank up doing world PvP with a leaderboard or increase the honor gains from World PvP. Add more objectives and resources to collect. Add unique chests and rewards hidden across zones so players leave the capital cities to find them.
---
## Event System
---
There was a Hero's Call Board in Cataclysm. There could be something similar in Classic where players could create and signup for serverwide events. Player-run PvP/PvE events such as speed runs, ironman runs, dueling tournaments, Roleplaying games etc..
---
## New Classic Races
---
There will always be a demand from some players for more races/classes etc.. The classes Blizzard introduced in the expansions don't belong in Classic WoW. From a gameplay and lore perspective. However, Worgen and Goblin were prominent in Classic WoW, and adding these two races and their zones would fit in perfectly.
---
## Boats
---
Having a new tradeskill profession that allowed players to build. Being able to sail from Booty Bay to the Lost Isles across the ocean could add for a lot of immerson. Being able to fish, pvp, treasure hunt, and just hang out on the open seas might be fun.
---
Some ideas for patch content here
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0rogx/my\_take\_on\_the\_classic\_post\_naxx\_contentmassive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0rogx/my_take_on_the_classic_post_naxx_contentmassive/)
---
But then, every game, including Star Craft or Overwatch, is a RPG, by your definition. Which means your definition of the term is devoid of meaning, since it can apply to anything and everything.
---
After my two friends stopped playing (After picking Alliance) I decided to play where I will be happy because I will be stuck with that choice if they decide to quit.
---
I know that it's nice to play with friends, but not if it means being the last active player that is stuck with something he didn't even want.
---
6 days is actually super fast and it requires to be fully prepared. Plus, you must acknowledge that the questing hubs will be crowded when classic launches. 
---
The average should be closer to 10 days (assuming people wander around, level professions, do class quests and a few dungeons). Which means 240h, or 4h per day for 60 days.
---
World of Warcraft generated about $100 million in revenue last year.
---
WoW Classic is not going to have 500,000 people playing it a year from now to even match that.
---
I was testing out AV yesterday, and atleast those rams there were fast as fuck. I did frost nova, slow totem and it still kept up with me running.
---
oh they will. If I had the thought, i'm sure 5000 others have too. I'd do it if Shaman weren't my ride-or-die class.
---
Yeah, the mail pants alternative reward is not very useful anyway.
---
In a group setting, handing out reasonable amounts of water and food is part of your job.
---
Plus helpfull mages (handing out refreshments, "want a portal to $major_city?" after the last boss dies etc.) get remembered and picked first when looking for a group. Reputation matters, generally more than a few seconds time investment.
---
About 45 minutes too late for my upvote.
---
You can use juju flurry on other players.
---
Of course 
---
Once you over gear a run you literally don’t have to care.  Once your in T1/T2 gear you can be really careless.   
---
But in blue or worse gear you have to set a standard.  
---
Especially as when you PUG you don’t trust everyone.  
---
Hell I can’t remember how many time I have draw aggro as a healer from the tanks in PUGS by healing him.  In most cases Those tanks are the ones who also will pull when your OOM after healing everyone as he struggles to keep aggro.  
---
And by the time your in raid gear you have enough guild members online almost at anytime to trust and don’t have to relay on pugs.
---
False.
---
World of Warcraft is an RPG.
---
ESO is an RPG.
---
All version of Final Fantasy are RPGs.
---
EVE Online is an RPG.
---
Runescape is an RPG.
---
Maplestory is an RPG.
---
Pokemon is an RPG.
---
The Witcher is an RPG.
---
Fallout is an RPG.
---
Diablo is an RPG.
---
Dragon Age is an RPG.
---
There's nothing permanent about the character you choose in StarCraft or Overwatch. They're identical to every other character of that same type. You don't even get to name them.
---
Not anymore, now people have figured out a shortcut to bypass the bridge in av and horde win 90% unless it's a pre made
---
Ctrl + p save as PDF?
---
The classic client has the exact same addon capabilities as retail, it's definitely possible to make an addon like that.
---
The Nicker ftw
---
Which is a shame, as MoP is now regarded as one of the best expansions. Wonderful content and zones, definitely up there for me.
---
Have you played World of Warcraft? Otherwise you can't really be aware of it's "state" at all. It's still the most popular MMORPG today.
---
Give the Starter Edition a shot. If you hate every minute of it, neither Classic nor Retail is for you.
---
Malf is snoozing away in classic so I think I'm pretty safe until they release cata again 😂
---
Rouges. Totally. And for Classic at least Druid is a nono, too as far as for now. All others are appealing in one or another way.
---
Not only will this be less viable on classic launch. I highly doubt you were farming 150g/hour on any private server doing this.
---
Kill em and end this shitshow before it starts
---
Om my Vanilla server, Alliance was pretty dominant in AB, at least up until 1.12
---
Sorry I didn't realize that flying mounts, death knights, removal of elites from levelling and powering the quest item value, release of blood elfs and draenei, and occupying outlands/northerend which where both about 1/4th the size of all of classic wow with minimal interaction to do things and the introduction of LFG during WOTLK all didn't exist, my bad your right i definitely sound like i never played either.
---
anti-extradition protest in Honkkong, I wager
---
The plate chest piece is probably the pre-raid BiS tanking item (for Phase 1 at least). Decisions, decisions...
---
Lucky I lose every Bg in arena unless its rated
---
No need to attack people over something you didn’t understand. My point does not even apply to rogues. I recommend working on your reading comprehension as rogues cannot use axes.
---
I wish Orc ladies had better hair options in vanilla. The only non-bald one clips into your back every time you jump. Probably gonna end up rolling the PvP inferior Troll just to have better hair :(
---
Well, I played horde, so not that lucky.
---
Haha nothing wrong with boats and hoes!!
---
well I guess we've discovered that classic and retail are two different games then?
---
Yes, absolutely. I'm going to roll the same class and race too.
---
Now my alts on the other hand, I can't remember their names. I think they will get new names.
---
I think the first advice is to not look for advice
---
Dive into Classic WoW blind, without any guides or addons or anything that tells you what to do. It will be the purest and most immersive way for you to enjoy the game, the way we once enjoyed it
---
90 second wf totem is still longer than spending min of 1 minute to buff 40 ppl
---
Warriors that are levelling get targeted pretty hard.
---
A few reasons; 
---
1. People know that when you get a healer at 60 you’ll be an unstoppable force.
---
2. You are essentially the easiest fight for rogues, mages and warlocks - so people your own level will pick on you.
---
3. Level 60s love killing warriors because there is very little you can do - a mage can poly, priests can MC, rogues can blind, druids root etc...
---
It’s just less of a inconvenience to kill you.
---
The upside is that people much higher level lose honour for killing you if you are 10+ levels lower, I believe.
---
A few tips - roll with a healer, or a dps when in areas of faction conflict.
---
Stay off the roads or avoid popular ganking areas.
---
For example; the entrance to STV from dusk wood is prime death zone - go with a group here.
---
Also, the arena attracts more pvp oriented players - who aren’t above killing lowbies out of boredom. 
---
From my perspective - there is plenty you could do to avoid being ganked - but you are trying to PvE server on a PvP server.
---
The final alternative is to accept that PvP servers are brutal places and that it is part of the levelling experience.
---
The upside is that once you are 60 - you can try and correct this behaviour whilst also earning honourable kills. 
---
The final solution is to level two toons at the same time and get a feel for both server types.
---
item of topic: The casuals want to lower the bar so they can compete.
---
I don't say this to be contrarian but you know pandaren were in WC3 before WoW, right? They're canon way before MoP
---
You underestimate just how important meters are to a VERY large portion of players.
---
Wasn’t ment  like that  so apologies if it did
---
Cool circlejerk guys.
---
If you go check your games and subs on thr website, do you have the wow ptr for classic?
---
Drrrring, ding ding ding, ding, drring
---
Nah, they'll be a couple weeks into the new Rize of Azshara raid with a lot of new content and a new season.
---
WoW Classic is not a Retail killer. It's Blizzard's way of measuring how much they need to change Retail in 10.0 to successfully convert their old fans over to the game they develop and make more money off of than Classic could ever provide.
---
Once they figure that out in about 2 years, they'll sunset Classic and let everyone transfer over to WoW 2 (since both Retail and Classic players will be level 60).
---
I played on various EU realms, and horde not just winning but annhialating every bg was a fact of life. It was normal to win AB 1500-0. After wotlk, horde was swarmed by kids and alliance dominated as all the hc pvpers faction changed
---
It depends on race, really. Best you could don't give your female character femine name. Usually in MMORPG I play male characters but in wow models are really awful for some races. I will main human Rogue so I am rolling female, same with my alt NE druid. If I would play horde, I would probably go for male troll / female orc / male undead.
---
no one would ever lvl in stv.. Except for rogues..
---
I watched a few videos on classic already. I myself couldn't play it as there were no servers in my country. I started in TBC, and that was when the game really exploded. There was a lot less players in vanilla than TBC and I think that means that such server wide efforts would take longer. If the hype holds, servers will be highly populated and things should work fine, maybe even faster than before. Even if you can't put same effort as back then.
---
I know the game FELT a lot more populated in vanilla but that's because of all the community that was bigger and more engaging, not because of numbers of players.
---
No, everyone with the client installed gets that.
---
The stress test invites have not gone out
---
2 warriors.  2 priests is overkill
---
I'd say just hold out and remain untainted by bfa, if you end up hating classic you'll still have an active sub to try retail.
---
Go to beta settings and click on classic. Damn that was difficult.
---
For Alliance, there is something called Human race trait which gives same as Orc race trait but for clubs and swords. My point stands.
---
For a guild that might be riding the line between being able to clear something or not, putting in some extra time to have that extra kick could make or break their raid. Your opinion doesn't apply to everyone, man.
---
You won't get honored after leaving the newbie zone. You're probably mistaken by pserver inflated values here.
---
I mean that was the intent of retail. Didnt work out at alm brcause of the secondary stats. Not only do people still need different gear for different specs but also different gear for aoe/st
---
Dont do it. I've never used heroin, but im fairly sure its basicly the same thing. Except here, you gain weight. 
---
All jokes aside, its a very VERY good game and its worth the sub - Ive been playing it for ages. I think a good time would be to start with classic. There will be alot of people like you and (most) of us veterns will be happy to help you out  :)

---
Yeah, I know. I knew then, too. I didn’t like how silly, fat and cartoonish they made them. They are a 95% match to Kung Fu Panda. I don’t think that they matched/match the Warcraft aesthetic.
---
Norway used to be a part of Sweden, and before that a part of Denmark.
---
This applies to retail, but most likely works in classic too:
---
If it has to work in combat, no. If it has to be done without /script, no. If it has to be a macro and not an addon, that might be difficult.
---
Unless that other person's guess of @mouseover works, which I doubt, you would most likely have to write yourself an add-on for this (cause no one else probably wants to make something so niche).

Give it a rest, you jive turkey.

Every week that goes by I’m wondering increasingly whether it might be. 
---
Vanilla in 2006 had more than 4x the amount of players that current retail does.
---
That’s great, it’s still a role playing game which is the point here. Again, rpg is very broad, I don’t know how much simpler I can explain it. WoW is a mmorpg, regardless of what you think it is, that’s what it is.
---
Finally playing as shaman in classic. I fell in love with my shaman when i had a character boost back in mists of pandaria. since then i only play shaman and i fucking love it (i even got a thrall tattoo on my shoulder - fuck yeah he's also back in classic as my leader xD)
---
also i want to be full t2 someday because that set looks so epic and perfectly fitting for chainlightnings :)
---
aaand last but not least i want to master engineering and throw some stungrenades at my enemies in pvp... hype is real right now!

Twice actually, once at the end of MoP and once at the end of Legion
---
Critting for a few million in legion did have a certain charm.
---
How could summoning yourself to your current situation ever be useful lmao
---
Excuse me: mouse clicking and keyboard turning was not even in MC a thing. We had bad PCs, slow internet and bad theory of the game. But we were not dumb.
---
Hey LeBron, why’d you join some league in Asia no one watches instead of the NBA?
---
Well, the teams over there are not so great, so I figured it was a bigger challenge.
---
Yeah, okay.
---
I doubt this will be as big of an issue as it is on a private server.
---
Most guilds will be fine with you bringing the basic consumables for each raid, and then flask up towards end of AQ40 and Naxxramas progression.
---
DM buffs are sweet, but can be purged off and won't make or break a raid, so there isn't a huge incentive to get those for every raid. It will probably be used for a push on a boss that you haven't managed to take down yet, which I feel adds to the classic feeling.
---
The same way you'd go into UBRS and MC the casters to buff your raid with fire resistances before you go to face Ragnaros
---
Well fuck those guys. If people want changes they should be sent to gulag.
---
I don't know if it has ever been addressed, but I truly hope the devs implement separate log-in queues for each faction on the same server. A realm should never be player capped with a 1:4 faction imbalance.
---
Some incentive or gentle nudging by the UI to pick the faction with low representation on a given realm could also benefit the game.
---
benediction. i was super young during vanilla so my undead priest on my brothers account never got to max, by the time i got my own account i decided i wanted to play rogue instead, deeply regret not getting my priest to max before it got removed since i mained her from mop until bfa
---
I’m sure reserving items will be a thing in Classic. 
---
Tbh I don’t really mind it. If someone goes through the trouble of forming, organizing and “leading” a raid, they can reserve ONE item. If I need the item they want to reserve, I won’t join their group. It’s that simple.
---
give it a try, if you like mmos classic could be for you. There is no harm in trying, it cost allmost nothing.
---
Why even ask ?
---
I mean there is no alternative at the moment , atleast for me , if you have something you want to play why stop ?
---
And if you have a mmo craving just try out classic when it comes out, would be shitty if its a nice game for you and you miss out on it cause you never gave it a try.
---
Props for Hong Kong !
---
But, they were only 2 million.
---
We will be triple that number !
---
Yes.
---
That's not how it works anymore, starting with BfA.  [https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/17/17583338/world-of-warcraft-legion-battle-chest-subscription-only](https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/17/17583338/world-of-warcraft-legion-battle-chest-subscription-only)

---
Well i mean you play as tank damage or healer, those are roles
---
Holy shit!
---
Utilize everything at your disposable. You have a wide array of stings, for example, and all of them are useful. There's one that reduces your target's strength and agility -- use it against warriors and rogues instead of just relying on Serpent Sting (your nature DoT). Drain caster mana with Viper Sting. Macro Mongoose Bite with Wing Clip so that there's a chance to do some extra damage while you're up close Wing Clipping them. Macro traps with Feign Death so you can exit combat mid-fight and lay down a trap.
---
Twice? I stand corrected.
---
Easy, you respec out of healing spec, farm and respec back. And do not even start complaining about respec costs. If you know what you are doing you can easily make enough gold in a hour for one respec.
---
Pretty sure it started in TBC, got worse in Wrath and Cataclysm set it in stone.
---
But the beginning was in TBC. 
---
Only a blind man can't see that.
---
you are nuts thats 100g
---
Plenty of time to play however you want to play when your off questing and leveling by yourself, but when you're in a group, the needs of the group supercede the wants of any individual. If a shadow priest joins a group as dps, I got no problem with it ... but if after 30 minutes without being able to find a healer if that priest refuses to take 1 for the team, then if/when a healer is finally found, there's gonna be a dps replacement as well.
---
And my ex girlfriend’s grandpa just sat at the Auction House all day. Never leveled, never quested. Just got E-Rich from the AH. 
---
This game game is just too good. There is no wrong way to play.
---
Your team always sucks no matter what faction you are.
---
Hi,
---
in my mind, you should be 
---
- master the macros that are important for your animal 
---
- be able to kite
---
- make sure that your animal gets enough to eat
---
- Resource management (enough arrows/ mun, food etc.)
---
- know how to use your skills, e.g. ice trap
---
And very important!
---
Don't attack someone of the opposing faction right away, but also help them sometimes.
---
Knowing my healer and having them in discord with me really lets me turn my brain off just because they can tell me they need to drink as we bs about whatever.  I kinda wonder if a lot of tanks try tanking with ww axe after 30 whether it actually works or not.
---
Everywhere.
---
Its not like you cant do most of the stuff on bfa. Rather than nobody actually organizes events like this. Its a totally different scenario. You have like half the population being streamers on beta servers and they are all on the same realm despite being EU/NA on retail. The possibilities are more wide and its a "new" thing now so its hot.
---
Red = dead
---
Splish.. splash.. splish.. splash
---
the reason its not updated since 2007 is simple.
---
2007 tbc has been released and the xp requirements have been changed.
---
the 2007 which you can download from his website is the "up to date" guide for classic
---
Feel just the same.
---
Im starting to feel a bit nervous though. Maybe ill find the game boring before I reach lvl 30? I played vanilla when I was 14, and did quite well in PVE - dungeons and raiding. Now im 28. Maybe it will be too easy and merely a grind? Hopefully not, but in the meantime the fever is real.
---
Because you said the point yourself. It is optimal to have the buff for the max part of raiding time (if it is for farming) so it is optimal to leave the game as soon as you get it to the moment you start raiding. 
---
From my point of view there are a lot of possibilities to fix world buffs. Banning from raid. Banning from any other raid (Nef / Ony head only for MC, BWL, Onyxias Lair, ZG Buff only for ZG). Letting them run out when offline. 
---
Some of them have really problematic implications, mostly the %Stats (health pools much to big) and %Crit (changing some classes like holy pala or fire mage significantly). When a guild can beat Patchwerk with world buff but not without what is gonna happen? They will not raid when the head is on cooldown. Or everybody has to get the buff in advance and log off. Both is bad for the game. They should gear up in BWL / AQ instead. World buffs are an exploit. At least in progress raiding. There is no point to say otherwise. They are unintended, bad for the game and not used in Vanilla.   #Change
---
Only a couple.
---
1. Be VERY patient (in everything : pulling, leveling, WPvP, corpse runs...everything)
---
2. Don't be a dick, talk to people, make friends
---
These are the most important ways to prepare for Classic. Everything else will just fell into place.
---
This would be a better analogy if we were talking about pvp content. It's pretty irrelevant in pve. It would be more like if Lebron decided to go train teens in a league in Asia that nobody watches
---
Actually I think he's doing it right. He has the information about a major event but doesn't have to expose himself to that subreddit or the immersion into their absolutely constant negativity. 
---
I've embraced this philosophy and encourage people to consider it. Paying attention to the news made me much more angry and benefited me almost not at all. Once in a while in group conversations I have to stay quiet for the first few minutes to pick up what others are talking about but the other 99.999% of life is more pleasant without wallowing in impotent frustration over whatever new horrible thing people are doing / trying to do / did that I cannot affect. 
---
There are great books, documentaries, and podcasts about positive things to immerse into and those satisfy the curiosity itch.
---
Idk why nobody remembers that reserving items was a thing, even back in Vanilla (at least on DragonMaw, where I played)
---
No gf but shaved my beard today. I can't walk around walking like hobo. I will shave while waiting for people come to dungeon/summ or flying.
---
IIRC [this spell](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=10318) worked on the playable undead race.
---
Ok, so you just proved my point...? Or are you seriously trying to say that Locks are as impactful as Warriors with a pocket healer?
---
And GL will put your DKP @-50
---
whatsup guys, madseason here and today we are talking about the top 10 most famous, or in some cases infamous people in wow
---
watched through these episodes yesterday while playing DS3 to quench my thirst of RPG addiction
---
What's the reason that makes Alliance have shorter queue times? (From what I hear at least)  
---
Is it true for all battlegrounds?
---
Hm. When was this? Because in PvP my realm back then was clearly horde dominated in BGs.
---
&gt; as long's you've got enough threat
---
Thats the thing though, mages seem to really like to unload on mobs that have almost reached the tank (on los pulls) or 0.5 seconds after the tank went in.
---
So in classic, I can't check if Iam in combat or not?
---
&gt; Arcane Power now does splash damage in 150 yard radius.
---
Could wipe an invading army just by dpsing a target dummy (if they were there)
---
But they are already practising for the core hound packs in mc.
---
That is not even counting if you spec for PvP too yet some people are able to do it. If you wanna roll a healer be prepared to go an extra mile!
---
Cata's early high-difficulty heroics compensated pretty well. For me WoW didn't fully deviate from the path until they nerfed those a few months in, at which point it was made clear that they were embracing a plan to totally exclude mid-level players in favor of easy mode and hard mode only.
---
I don’t think they are inviting more people for the beta, or maybe I’m wrong?
---
The future truly is bright
---
An auto need addon should do the trick :D
---
People certainly tried it on my server (blackrock), but I never joined a 'reserve' group, and I don't know if anyone ever did.  It was just messages in chat, not dungeon groups.  
---
I will not join any reserve groups in classic.
---
This. It’s Supply and Demand. If nobody joined Reservation groups, then those groups wouldn’t exist. They only exist because people are okay with it. Economics is a beautiful thing.
---
Rofl... Wrath was a complete joke compared to TBC and release Cata was actually a step up from it in terms of difficulty.
---
I believe he may have been running just 30 points in enhance as stormstrike was fairly buggy and considered an unviable talent in early - mid vanilla. It used to reset attack timer to 0, so if you mis-timed it (or played with delay) it was difficult to get much value out of it. Natures swiftness at 21 points resto was a much more valuable talent, for instant heals or chain Lightning to add to burst
---
why are shamans shit?
---
The fel seeds were already in the game by then. BC added flying mounts, started to make questing much more easier and deprecated old content. WotLK added LFG and the shop. 
---
Everything needed to kill all social aspects was already in the game by patch 3.2.
---
Cataclysm just killed the gameplay itself.
---
It does not mean they were all bad but the tradeoffs cannot be ignored.
---
classicdb.ch has basic stuff, like "armor, hp, damage per swing". It doesn't have dps or swing interval, unfortunately. It does cover at least some of the abilities affecting dps, like for example, abilities that give bonus attacks.
---
Yes, you should. For practicing.
---
still no1 cares
---
I see you’ve played hunter before.
---
Link?
---
If it's a one off item usage your wasting my time.
---
You won’t, but SOMEONE will. There’s definitely a cutoff for Diminishing Returns on how many items a Leader can reserve. Reserve too much, NOBODY joins, don’t reserve at all, you get /roll’d on.
---
Depends on the server. 
---
On 3/4 of the servers I played in vanilla, Horde dominated both population &amp; battlegrounds. 
---
Naturally, 3 of those servers had longer queue times when going into a bg as horde, the other one I had longer queues as Alliance. 
---
It'll really depend on the server.
---
People on wow are so fucking "nice", and by nice I mean toxic they just take the time to add ^^ at the end of their messages. 
---
I remember once i fat fingered my key board on the final boss of a raid (black hand first floor) and everyone proceed to flame me like "does he even know the strat ^^ ?", "Huuum what was that ^^ " when it was obvious I just unpurposely fail. At the second try, I ended up third dps as a Monk tank and when the boss was at 3% I suicided because I didn't see why I should invest myself for these fucking trashy noobs. I hate the wow community , they are a bunch of hypocrite scum.
---
At least in league of legends people just insult your mom and tells you to slith your throat, toxic but honest.
---
But you will have less crits with less int. Probably a small amount but still should be calculated in there.
---
I meant playing the character, not acting as the character and pretending to be him. Playing the role of the character.
---
Parry also meant parry haste causing damage spikes on the tanks. Healer have to compensate.
---
Still it will be much easier to start then it was in 2005. The gear is 1.12 (much better) and the class knowledge is, too. Mages back then had next to no +damage and only got it in MC. The MC gear itself was buffed, too. I remember my first MC try. I was lvl 58 because they missed a healer. I am totally sure the preparation will be much better now and we will have a better time in MC. 
---
AQ40 and Naxx on the other hand are much harder on both equip, mechanics and also preparation. It is less trivialized by gear. But people have time to adopt, AQ will come out much later. Count me in for some cosy raiding at the start :) at least when you did MC and BWL already so you learn fast. Also I am sure I'm a better gamer today even though a bit old now \^\^

Ask this question again in a few months and I'll give you a proper answer :)
---
What
---
Food sells for almost nothing. Lowest level food sells for 1C. Lowest level cloth(linen) sells fo 13C.
---
Nope, that would be a condition
---
Its literally just grinding mobs in your level range. Idk where those horror stories come from.
---
I can't agree with that, which is why I choose to avoid constant reminders.
---
Fuckkk
---
Fuckkkkk I loved doing shit like this. I remember when my friend got his aquatic form in Vanilla, we swam round the continent as much as we could just for the adventure.
---
Yup. I'm gonna be doing this for some instances (Mostly righteous orbs/Flask patterns).
---
But to justify it I will be overgeared and running with a equally geared healer essentially guaranteeing a succesful run. That's pretty fair if you ask me.
---
You encourage people to ignore current events? Just cover your ears and ignore it. Maybe it will go away on its own. This aint it chief. Imagine a world without those pesky things called protests all those negative minded people participate in.
---
A role-playing game is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. There is literally no decision making regarding character development in WoW, Pokemon or any "modern" video game. I mean ok, there was a Tides of Numenera but it was rather exhausting experiance.
---
Unless you're losing then everyone in the team is a useless scrub that shouldn't be there
---
Powershifting and Wolfshead helm, it takes a lot of mana pots and demonic runes but it's possible.
---
It doesnt work like that. If theres less people on your faction, theres less competition.
---
&gt; if they lead the group to a wipe its the tanks fault,
---
You mean its the healers fault for not keeping up
---
2nd for tapering. 
---
I played the first 2 stress tests, and that was enough of a taste for me. Unsubbed last week, not checking for beta access anymore. Not going to tune into streamers for the rest of the wait either. Just casually browsing the sub now until we can reserve names/servers on mid August
---
I mean sure, it's not impossible to determine some sort of 'sweet spot' for the general NPC at a specific frostbolt rank, but I very much doubt you'll ever see anyone go to such lengths.
---
A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game;[1][2] abbreviated RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. None of it happens in WoW. Get over it. Just because you create a character and do quests, doesn't mean it is a role playing. Ok? Ok.
---
Also, there are a lot more good quest rewards for caster classes in the NE zones as opposed to the Human zones. The only real benefit to making the infamous run as a NE is to get Deadmines.
---
It's done by the definition though.
---
Rank 10, Naxx, every cool quest done, maxed professions, member of good guild, cool internet friends I didn't make since like 10 years already or so.
---
Start with classic. Everyone loves this game, you will too.
---
Lol. Better individual players with more skill? That doesnt make any sense. Millions of people played the game with almost 50/50 division to ally and horde, but somehow skilled individual players are on one side, and order followers on the other.
---
I see I'm not the only one who makes greetings macros. :)
---
I agree and had a similar experience with this philosophy. When I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2014, I was completely removed from media for \~6 months, this was a wonderful experience and I realized after the fact the positives far outweighed the negatives.
---
 While I consider myself an informed individual, this time away from news was a huge blessing in disguise. Ultimately, I now feel that most news stories aren't actionable for us and just lead to stress (or more recently, existential despair).
---
Ah yes clicking rare abilities in a stationary role and fight.
---
This proves that MOST people click and keyboard turn LOL
---
You can 1v1 every rogue or warrior by going with a reckoning build.
---
But as everyone else said here. You are loaded with tons and tons of defensive tools and supportive tools in such a way that not making use of that is a waste. Like, you can swing a weapon around with seal of command and all that, and ofcourse it will do some pain, but rets true potential lies in that it is a toolkit of sorts bring a bit of everything to the table.
---
On some pserver I actually run some stupid prot build which can 1v1 people because of reckoning and even casters since I can outlast them with healing. Its a blast to play. 
---
I recommend watching drakova. Hes a very experienced paladin pvp player and theorycrafter. Some of his old vids are still up.
---
Bruh if you think anyone is going to give a shit about 8.2 for more than a day I want what you’re smoking 
---
Old fans aren’t going to go back to retail in droves unless the game is fundamentally changed from the ground up and that shit ain’t happening
---
Classic isn’t going away in 2 years. It’s here to stay, blizz is not going to cut off support from a release this big after 2 fuckin years
---
Don’t worry, you’ll be done with the new content and back in the endless tomestone grind by the time classic is out 😏
---
\- finally playing classic shaman (as i fell in love with shaman with mists of pandaria)
---
\- getting full T2 or at least shoulders plus some other pieces
---
\- master engineering for using funitems like stungrenades or gnomish deathray in pvp :) 
---
\- just enjoy playing with my reallife buds ^((hallo björn!))
---
And to whar, may I inquire, were they thinking on that day
---
when they conjured up for a man like you a robe that looks so gaaaay
---
Itll be great for pve but not much for pvp im afraid :)
---
Balance classes without taking their identify. Don't make every class be good at everything, pros and cons. Here, fixed that for you.
---
Life Tap is a rare ability? He literally has two buttons to use and one of them he clicks. Pretending player skill hasn't improved is so boomer. You sucked back then,if you play the same as you do now you suck now as well.
---
I tend to agree, but it's more just you being a decent person. Barring streaming or some form of competitive opportunity to make money from playing, there's no reason to go join a guild with 90 other people trying to take your spot every day just for the sake of it. And really, until deep AQ40 and Naxx the difference in having raids on farm and casually waltzing thru weekly will be negligible.
---
I love how you are getting downvoted for answering the question and explaining why you play the game. What a bunch of idiots lol.
---
That's false information. The drop down option for the stress test is not available by default and only appears a few days before each beta stress test, if you've been invited for it. The only time it stayed up for a longer period of time was between the 1st stress test and the rerun that happened because of the messy server situation during the first stress test. (It's already available for the stress test this week)
---
And a lvl 40 mount helps with thaf
---
What do you use to detect it?
---
That's about as much detail as I could find on any given NPC on the various sites I came across, which is better than nothing but still lacking a bit of info I'm curious about. I want to know about certain enemies resistances to elemental damages and which spells they have available to them. I've found details on raid boss spells of course but it's difficult to find a good resource to just search an attackable NPC's name and be able to know if there is any quirk to fighting them that could make them easier with specific tools in your class's kit.
---
I got spoiled with how well maintained the OSRS wiki is while grinding over there, now I'm wishfully hoping something like that comes along for classic.
---
Agreed. They even said it themselves - they are looking into adapting more legacy servers for those looking to play TBC and WOTLK. They are blessed right now cause instead of developing a new game with changes, they just gotta reload and bug fix old builds. As far as development is concerned, they just got a license to print money.
---
But now you cant strafe while clicking new targets or whatever... Limiting yourself is never a good thing.
---
Just because he is snoozing doesn't mean you won't meet him during the [quest chain for the Scepter of the Shifting Sands](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/The_Scepter_of_the_Shifting_Sands_quest_chain). So no, you are not safe.
---
What trinket is causing the fire nova thingy?
---
That’s....that’s exactly what you do in WoW.  We’re acting out a roll of a character. How you act it out is completely up to you, and you’re doing it with other people, and every action you take effects the world. You log in and the world changes cause now you’re there. You really have it out for WoW don’t you? Where did the wow touch you? You can trust me
---
Was a pretty casual warlock raider back then and kind of nooby. However I remember farming up around atleast 20 soul shards. This could not be farmed from grey mobs, those with level range far below yours. We were like 4 warlocks in total in our raiding guild mc/ony/bwl so in between us we still had alot of soulshards
---
Nice fix addon, thanks!
---
When they were preparing for AV weekend everyone (including me) that had the classic client  installed got the option a few days ago together with the "You cannot play classic yet", there was a huge ruckus on twitter and here.
---
However unlike the stress test when you look inside your battlenet account ([https://account.blizzard.com/games](https://account.blizzard.com/games)) you will not find the additional PTR license
---
Haha were you guys angrymonkey, angryfox etc?  There was a guild like that on agamaggan where I was playing.  They were probably the most competitive PvP guild we faced at the time of my grind.
---
Based on your post it sounds like you guys too.  I played rogue in Anathema Sky and that's what we had happen to us - everyone would afk out of the games against us because they had instant queues.
---
The first levels are rough though. Yeah, your damage is great for all of those 5 frostbolts you can cast before you are oom.
---
Then you need to drink. And then drink another one of those pathetic conjured water imitations, because they lag behind quite a lot.
---
Remember this conversation in the future.
---
I’m always weirded out by these ”alliance kidz” comments, as my experience of playing both sides almost 50/50(horde a little more) I always had the feeling that Horde had way younger playerbase.
---
I can relate to this.
---
how is this relevant for this Sub ?
---
Healer Paladin.
---
They've done that twice already, first time a big one in MoP (for technical reasons), and one in BFA... and when I see BFA content I still immediately think these numbers look ridiculous. The numbers are so crazy that when they pop up on your screen you don't really care for them. Also, the stats on gear is crazy too, especially for a system where for the most part you just decide what gear is better based on which number is higher - some gear has 4 digits of stamina increase on it, and that's after 2 stat squishes. Might of Menethil, a weapon that does over 95 dps in Classic, only has 12 dps in retail.
---
But, then you have retail players posting things like this:  [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20760698448](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20760698448) 
---
" So it's come to my attention that there will be a stat squish, gone are the days of 2 million crits and 2 million dps..  
---
Totally ruins any sense of progression to me, I know we had a stat squish before but I think that was because of technical limitation so it was warranted but now?  
---
I dunno...it kinda kills my buzz I had for BFA a little bit, are we going back to the days when 3k dps was considered good?  
---
1500 crits? 20k HP?  
---
Seems like we're going in reverse and not progressing at least to me.. "
---
and
---
" im a little concerned that they are going to make it too hard to solo old raids w/ combination of stat squish and mob scaling. "
---
The games just need to be treated as separate, I think it's the only way. Work on TBC and maybe WOTLK servers after the Classic cycle is over (keep Classic servers as an option, though), and in the BFA leg introduce 1-2 more expansions and see how the sub numbers hold up. Then, consider a WoW2 maybe, with elements of classic WoW design philosophy, but new engine and such. Maybe a new IP.
---
As I said, stationary role and fight... two dudes, that makes it the norm? What about the 100s of videos where people are not doing this? People knew how to play in 2004 ... some bad habits on videos is bull.
---
Anyway "boomers" wtf is this chip on your shoulder? We are millenials for a start. Player skill hasn't improved, the mechanics have.
---
Pretending people were inept 15 years ago based on gameplay mechanics is absolutely stupid.
---
It's a really true, there is a blue post explaining that anyone with the game installed got the beta to show up on their client so they could uninstall it easier. Go look it up
---
Mage is too boring to play in PVE for a noob

Try rushing on live where you don't have 300 bajillion HP and you can't pull 10 elite mobs at a time as a clothie.
---
Post these hundreds of videos then.
---
Holy FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUck duuuuuude!

Be real. The moment you replaced your T2 with a random quest green from Hellfire Peninsula was the beginning of the end. Old content didn't matter.
---
(this is a reply to a deleted comment that accused me of covering my ears and hoping bad things would go away but it's also relevant to our conversation so I'll just post it here)
---
I found that I was very frustrated and it was not benefiting my day to day experience. It was, in fact, making things worse for me to be constantly told, "A bad thing that you can't do anything about happened in Tibet today." After 30-90 minutes of being told by the serious-voiced newsperson about how awful everything is, the TV got turned off and I was returned to my house in a newly-reinforced negative mood. 
---
So I started generally avoiding the news a decade ago and that was okay but I'd still check out headlines and, in retrospect, it wasn't time spent that was affecting me, but rather it was the way it manipulated me. I think that humans are very action-oriented and so, when we are told "Here is an awful thing. You can't do anything about it." we feel very angry and frustrated. And I did. Every day, just from reading five minutes of headlines. And I asked myself if *any* exposure to such content was worth it.
---
It's been a much, much more enjoyable few years since I began actively avoiding all news. I find that I still get the big, important bits. If a tornado is coming I'll hear about it. My area had major floods last summer and, prior to them getting really bad, I heard about it and went and helped fill sand bags.
---
It's not a trinket, it's an engi item.

https://classicdb.ch/?item=10646
---
Should you start with the version that came out first and everyone has been saying is better to the point that they are re-releasing it soon? Noooooo, start with BFA &gt;.&lt;
---
Oh man I wish I had all my old screenshots of my HWL grind.  I remember the first time I got 1 million honor.  Everybody on Horde was freaking out and I basically ditched all PvE for PvP.  Seeing that number and having such a huge lead felt so good.
---
Yeah it would be crazy. Arcane power only last 15 secs though. The concept is to have new raid sets have bonuses that imorove your talents. It would enable players to experiment and use new builds in pve and pvp. Have other stat affixes that are in line with other gesr alresfy in Vlassic works too.
---
With cryptojacking we typically see http/https traffic to known crypto pools after outbound connections to whatever sketchy adware ridden domains. Cryptomining can be similar but likes to use a wide range of ports; occasionally you also see the software signature match on IDS/IPS, but typically we detect heuristically through a 6 week data set.
---
&gt;It happens on private servers but it's generally frowned upon, will be interesting to see how people will react on release.
---
It's perfectly fine reserving items. It always have been, and always will be. You will always be able to find people that are okay with it, or just not need that specific item.
---
Clear Naxx have fun
---

Huh, as a tank I have more issue with hunters and warlocks ninja pulling with multishot and dotting everything up before me or even the healer is ready. Usually imo healer and tanks must be the leaders of the group so they can asap kick the dps that just turn off their brain and won't behave. I had a hunter start mass pulling while I was trying to keep the healer away from harm while being silenced in sfk and I just flat out told him if he pulls one more mob he is gone. I have so little tolerance for people like that. The healer was clearly getting rekted and sfk is a pretty hard dungeon at its level range due to silence and everyone having banshees spawning on em.
---
I remember agi leather pants that are insane, but the rest is worth it too I guess, and loads of exp
---
!
---
That's interesting, I didn't know it's been bugged for so long. Haven't played retail WoW in years.
---
Good thing I'm not rolling a hunter I guess.
---
If they reserve valor chest and you need other items, why not join? I won't join a run where my item is reserved. If my item is not then it's basically just a group
---
Yeah, if the tank is marking and taking his time, sure. But if he is chain pulling and I walk up to him, I might already be in combat before I can sit down - or I'm sitting right where he intends to tank those cleaving mobs or the mage frost novas all the mobs into place around me, which then can continue to crit me while I sit and try to get that one more mana tick in.
---
Often enough, dropping down immediately is the only chance you get and maybe a signal for the tank that he is on his own for the moment.
---
Nah...no lag here, how about you? Oh wait I’m dead.
---
Mhmm no. You just hurt yourself. Most try hards in newb guilds stay there couse of other reasons... social and personality reasons. Not bc they are fine
---
Lock/Pally beats every other 2-man combo in PvP. It's ridiculously strong, and the better of his two options. In organized BGs Lock is weaker with a Paladin versus Warrior with a Paladin, but only then. I'm not sure why you're trying to increase the scope of the question past the 2-man prerequisite OP gave.
---
:-)
---
Wiat? Wat sett'ns?! I'M LE CONFUSE!
---
oh i understand, i was more pointing out the ludicrous range on it, would def make mages the ultimate farmers because it would take the entire CD of it before you would even finish looting.
---
Classic will maintain subs in the millions.  If China gets back on board as I expect them too it will probably push the 10 mill mark
---
Still can't decide between Shaman and druid but :  
---
- Rank 11
---
- Having a full epic gear
---
- Then mostly wPvp
---
Female only: Nightelves, Gnomes, Trolls, Orcs
---
Male only: Tauren
---
Got to go fast
---
I'm playing a paladin on beta and I haven't been able to find the option at all.
---
Good hunter = don't fuck up a lot
---
Great hunter = don't fuck up at all
---
And isn't usable in combat..
---
The hype is there for me, I decided on a main class and an alt too, my professions and the races. 
---
Now I got it all together, so I don‘t need to read every single blue post, new streamer video or so anymore. I know it’s happening in late August and i‘ll wait it out without being too stressed  :)
---
How does this explain that the stress test option in the client only shows up a few days before each stress test? It has so for me every single time so far.
---
Oh THAT is why people got mad at me for ganking joana
---
I wanna main a mage, but man, I wish they were a less mainstream.
---
Mr booze! Mr B double o z e will never loose!
---
I love to help
---
The chance of getting a shard from raid mobs is negligible isn't it? You gotta have the killing blow don't you, that's why you pull your pet back at leveling as well
---
You will :) 
---
Enjoy vanilla, I will.
---
You can't use shadowmeld in combat.
---
Any way to raise this to Blizz's attention you think? I know it's relatively small but I found it much more enjoyable to heal when I knew for how much I was healing...
---
I didn't know goblin AH was cross faction that's fuckin littttt
---
I doubt this gonna happen again. People will be to busy to reach level 60
---
Or at least it'll be at a lower scale
---
If that makes you feel better about whatever is ailing you. Go for it.
---
Paladin/Warlock is far superior. BoM doesn't do much at low level, but BoW does. The warlock can also turn healing into mana. Just a monster pull machine with no downtime.
---
Paladin / Warrior is just awkward and the warrior won't even do much damage from rage until 35-40. 
---
People are giving misinformation here based on nostalgia, not reality. Look it up. Warlock / Pala is tier 1. Warrior / Pala is tier 3 or so
---
The encourage people to play in a way which isn't fun.
---
I'm ultimately fairly ambivalent as I don't have much skin in the game - I really don't intend to raid beyond a fairly casual level but I'd imagine I'd get pretty steamed about them if I was intending to.
---
I agree with everything you said, but TBC and Wrath added things that made the game worse, it all added some things that made it better. 
---
Not things like LFD and flying mounts. Fuck that noise. But things like more dynamic pvp fights (So that the fight wasn’t decided by one move or factor.) and arena. Arena probably isn’t popular around this sub, but it was without a doubt my favorite thing in all of WoW.
---
Because certain people have certain principles that they will Bullheadedly stick to, regardless of logic.
---
5man tank is fine.  Bit squishier than other tanks.  If you want to raid, your guild just needs to watch their initial threat in the beginning, which gets tough to remember in your 54th MC run.  Pally threat is great as long as nobody pulls off you.  Instant bops and from u and ur other pallies, and lip pots from warlocks and mages will help a lot. Healers will use bigger heal ranks. Your guild basically has to adapt to the pally tanks playstyle, so you gotta always show up and earn the respect of your guildmates.  So more focus is required from everyone, but doable.  Some fights are not conducive to pally tanks that require taunts.  
---
Be adaptable, some fights you mt, other fights you ot or nightfall, and maybe just heal for cleanse heavy fights.  Fishing in order to get armor pots, having a flask every raid is a must.  You are an underdog so be more prepared, helpful, and dedicated than others and you will make it.  You wont be the best tank but if you enjoy it, fk it play what u want.
---
&gt; There's nothing permanent about the character you choose in StarCraft or Overwatch. 
---
There is nothing permanent in your combat avatar in WoW as you can reset talents.
---
Call of Duty has perks that modify your class. So it's an RPG.
---
Skinning is just extra vendor trash money and LW is only for if you want to farm devilsaurs and f you’re officer in the guild so you can get the core leather recipe.
---
Otherwise LW is complete dogshit, excluding sash of mercy for Druid healers pre BWL bis
---
got shaved recently, no more neck beard.  
---
Im going for the opposite of neck beard
---
orcs are best at pvp.  orcs are best as enh.  Trolls are best as pve for resto and elem. 
---
shaman are a support class, so you can't win the meters.  You never get the credit you deserve.  You can't raid as a dps spec, because assholes.  You already have wf, so you want to drop grace of air, but the tank and dps get mad at you, if you do.
---
Found the kid.
---
Everyone working to their ability and only taking what they need is incredibly naive. Optimizing their gain with the least possible effort drives most people in life, so unless you have some kind of control freak AI basically enslaving people they will try to abuse the system as much as they can.
---
official forums
---
Pretty much this for me, too. I mean hype and stuff and excitement is all good. But the ridiculous level of overly exaggerated hype that some individuals seem to be displaying here is quite simply just uncalled for and certainly not healthy at all.
---
Just chill, relax, enjoy the time until WoW Classic comes out playing some other games because once it's out, there won't be any more time for anything else pretty much.
---
If i'm able to use pathing to solo boss raid, is this an exploit or a clever use of mechanics ?
---
I'm curious about this...
---
I'm going to buck the trend here and say it depends on yourself. If you feel you're quite a strong gamer then maybe try classic, if you're quite relaxed then maybe try the current release version as it's very very simple and new player friendly. 
---
Part of the issue many have with it is that, and classic can be a bit daunting without experience of even basics like turning the quest text to not slowly scroll let alone finding things without quest finder.
---
I don't agree, I think most people just want to get by.
---
Gnomes, Goblins, Taurens, Worgen in Top Hats. 
---
Ya don't like kung fu panda which is fair, just don't mention lore and cannon when it did stick to the cannon and it's lore was great, not only the new stories but expanding old ones. It had some of the best non edgy dark story writing in WoW.
---
Där snackar vi binds
---
Why would it be bad? Every time enemy dies you should be getting a shard from it, unless bags are full.
---
But if in doubt, roll a mage or something :d
---
Firefox?
---
I think the dark iron dwarves should be mentioned here.
---
Bronzebeard and Wildhammer dwarves are timid when it comes to magic because they saw what price the DI dwarves and Thaurissan had to pay...
---
The valley of Kings in loch modan, barely north of the gate to the searing gorge, supposedly serves as a reminder of this as well as a memorial. 
---
In terms of the lore, Dwarves don't fuck with magic. They don't trust it.
---
Bandages have a lot more utility than food does
---
With only 9 classes and thousands of players, you will always be playing a class plenty of others are playing.
---
I’d just focus on you and what you like. :)
---
Cause he is complaining about something that Blizzard stated that they left in intentionally as part of Classic. There is an entire blue post about it. People just didn’t like that he was being a bit superior about it, not that he made the add-on.
---
Enjoy vanilla :)
---
I'll never stop responding out of boredom :)
---
I get that. I've made reserve groups too. When I go with random I used to discuss with the others of my class to sort loot etc.. I don't see a problem with reserving items, just don't join if you want that specific item. You want paladin items and lack dd. Im a hunter, sounds stupid to not join as I don't care about your reservation. But what what you say probably holds some truth. The best part is when loot drama ensues about reserved loot once it drops. It's insane how few people actually read
---
I've always seen whirlwind as a diamond with a ring on it
---
As far as I am aware, focus is still the ressource for hunters.
---
Obviously the negative side of playing hunter was the need to be at range in order to deal any sort of sustained damage output. Sit on him and his output will be close to nonexistent. Hence the craft was to be able to make the right decision on when to use your gap extenders offensively and defensively while wearing the enemy team down. Hunter/druid was more or less the only consistent counter to warr/druid in BC, but the skillcap required to pull it off at the toplevel was immense. 
---
Hunters had more or less infinite ressources with mana, and since being on top of them or LoSing would completely negate their output, this was honestly not a big deal. I reckon the focus change was made in order to get rid of the minimum range, which were both terrible ideas. 
---
Ever since, Hunters have been more or less a parenthesis in organized PvP. And if not, it has almost solely been as BM YOLO specc. The finesse of the class was removed to cater to people who werent able to grasp the potential of the class and at no point since WotLK has hunters scaled as well as their competition in the final tier of an expansion. Unfortunately this also added to the reputation of the faceroll huntards.
---
So your life's boring. 
---
Interesting.
---
:)
---
&gt;As a healer, I am going to avoid dungeon for the first weeks
---
Not going to be a good idea. First weeks the BEST players that are ahead are doing dungeons. And it seems that constantly running dungeons is the fastest way to levelup.
---
Yeah i'm refering to that. Players that are in a guild because they like the people and envoirment, but maybe half of it are noobish people, and they have to put extra effort to compensate and to teaching them to certain point, and just having patience to progress through the content slowly because of this. I think you have to try very hard and be very patient to progress that way, but also is very rewarding and probably very very funny and enjoyable (to stay there in the first place).
---
I think these people should be considered tryhards too, and I think it takes a lot more comittment in the long run that do 'World firsts'
---
There is 0% chance of a level squish before classic, IF one does happen (remember, nowhere has it been 100% confirmed) it will be in the next expansion which will likely drop late next year, classic would have been out a year by then.
---
Also they have already said that retail and classic are essentially function as completely seperate games and there will be no crossover
---
Retail already killed itself
---
Paladin
---
I played pala during original vanilla and will never do it again. Its soooooo boring.
---
Hard to combat that when you're the only one trying to get the flag, while the rest do a brawl in the middle and lose 9v5...
---
No ones knows.
---
No confirmation yet
---
my recollection is that it really sucked but it didn't really suck any more than other class' busywork and warlock got to be really cool and fun in other ways.
---
What are they using in retail?
---
Seconding this, just as an all around to anyone reading this. Most of the solo X/Y dungeon things we see on pservers and from old videos were done by people in T2 and such and because of this I wouldn't look to be doing them at launch, find world drops to solo farm instead of instances.
---
I think 2 months is quite short, I think a safe assumption would be 4.
---
It could be 3 , larger phases it could be 5. I don't think they'll do 2 month phases though, that's too quick for classic.
---
If its really a major concern - just focus on being one of the better / best Mages on your server and you'll be fine
---
The thing is, IF you dont have a mage, the healer is PAYING for those drinks. And if you pull so fast that you cannot just sit and drink to 100% you are paying even more because you arent getting even full usage out of each one of those.
---
Had this in Wrath with a warrior when i was raiding as ret. We were mostly competing for the same gear and always had lengthy discussions about classes and raid mechanics. Lost touch with him unfortunately and now I cant even remember his name :(
---
When people say "I pick female for the ass" I always assume they're sad human beings.
---
I agree the best kinds of players are not jaded and are willing to run all content continuously throughout the patch releases.  Those players understand the impact of guild turnover and want to instill confidence and a sense of camaraderie within the guild.  The catch is... that the players recruited must be worthy of such effort snd time invested.  This is dependent on the recruiters to put in work and weed out the players that dont fit in with the guild culture.
---
It's insanely cancerous, highest chance to die of any starting area, qnd thwn there's the Ban'Ethil Barrow.. you'll die at least three times there. WITH a group.
---
I’m proud to say that I have not a single fucking clue what a Transmog is.
---
Fuck, is it August yet?
---
If they're using old server names expect Al'Akir and Stormscale to be packed to the gunnels with hardcore PvPers, if they're using new names expect the Arthas server to be full of edgelords.
---
But you have to think about the "bad specs". 
---
"Bad Specs" for PvE for example are Ret pally and feral Druid.
---
If you give them more DPS in raids, you will make them completely OP in PvP. That's my main concern. Same goes For SPriest. Sure there are specs like a better Pally tank would be nice, which doesn't affect pvp that much. But most people who want these Classic + stuff talk about Ret and Feral IMO.
---
Clever use of game mechanics
---
&gt;  It's dumb. 
---
Who are you, to claim that others opinions are dumb.
---
And the AH prices are also better.
---
The very 1st armor vendor you come across sells gear for really cheap.  A few copper.  Sometimes I'll buy stuff from him that I didn't get while leveling to 5.
---
At least Blizzard tried to fix this farming several times during Vanilla. I'm not claiming they called it an "exploit".

You name dropped me for clout in the same thread we're posting in :^) 
---
Nothing you say can possibly phase me :^)
---
You'll remember me for another decade :^)
---
Enjoy vanilla :^)
---
It showing up a few days ago was due to a configuration change that makes it show up for everyone that has the client installed, regardless of having a stress test license. So "every single time" is just once, really, which is not anything to go off.
---
My advice is don't worry about it. Someone is always gonna stop playing, someone is always gonna reroll and suddenly be behind. No plan survives first contact with reality.
---
Have you looked up the definition of role playing? Vanilla wow is much about interaction with the community than the story like in retail.
---
Even if most people are content at a certain point they would still try to work less to get there. Nothing could stop them from pretending to be incapable of working more, so many talented people would most likely just do way less than they could, because the reward in such a system isn't worth it. 
---
That's also assuming the entire world has adopted the system, because if it's just a country or continent smart people would just get out and live in luxury somewhere else.
---
Then I may just The the Try-hardest of the Tryhards.
---
I intend on being my server’s Batman. Call me when you’re getting ganked; I’ll countergank and escort you (for FREE).
---
I'd just have a full 24/28 slot shard bag full, as I would at all times. Then replenish as we go on trash. Don't think I ever specifically farmed them.
---
More annoying in PvP, but draining someone is also the ultimate insult ;-)
---

---
hes updated the horde one and doing ally one now i believe
---
There's so much more to classes than that.
---
Sure the pve rotation is very simple but mages can buff, summon water and food, portals, they are the glass cannon ranged dps 
---
Warlocks do a bit less damage but provide curses, hs, ss, summoning
---
&gt;And very important! Don't attack someone of the opposing faction right away, but also help them sometimes.
---
How does that make a great hunter though?
---
...You think you do but you don't?
---
Guys, stop trying to remove things that existed in vanilla. I've seen threads about removing/reducing spellbatching, and now you want to remove melee leeway too?
---
Just accept that WoW Classic won't play the same a private server does. Private servers are way more responsive, this has been an established fact ever since their inception.
---
Learn the meta, deal with it
---
Dude food buffs are the shit.  Before level 15 it's sometimes the only way to get a stamina increase.

I like KFC
---
I seem to remember a lot of mechanics that require dispel, remove curse etc.
---
We couldn't even have mages lol. Nah it was unworkable as I remember. No druids... nah it was terrible.
---
I level with my friend who is a priest. I pull this way because I know he is good enough to Manage his mana, and I don’t overpull and work with him if I see he had to heal a lot last pull. 
---
Like the only time he drinks is because I overpull which happens occasionally with any other tank. Most of the mana regen is gained from spirit and using the 5 second rule to its fullest. 
---
And I’m a player that goes all out for pve and Pvp content. I use consumables while leveling and playing a warrior you have huge food problems. I expect a class who doesn’t need water while leveling to go all out on it in a dungeon. Given how little they drink because I reconagize when he needs to let his spirit regen, and that they literally don’t need water while leveling, I expect them to be able to afford 2 stacks of Water.

I thought it was fine, but I just wanted to clear it up for the other commenter.  Cheers.  🙂

Why this :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_ggLGj37qI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ggLGj37qI) was fix and considered as an exploit during WOTLK then (look description) ? Because it's clearly a clever use of game mechanics too = buff steal
---
can u send me the name too pls ?
---
It's particularly hilarious when two of those get into an argument. (Not good for the prospects of winning, though.)
---
You are lower priority on my list obviously, and if I can't spare the mana you better be ready to drain or bandage up (or eat, in between fights).
---
But if I can spare the mana, you'll get a hot ticking on you, so balance life/mana accordingly.
---
i agree 500k sounds a bit low but 10mil is just BIASED lmao
---
Looks really solid, but I feel like the congestion during launch will make herbalism unviable in the very beginning :(

as they were back then so you could actually play BGs outside of rush hours...
---
Shades don't scare a ret paladin 😉
---
Personal loot lol
---
Love you guys when you have that situational awareness and step in when needed.
---
Well, yeah, me as a vanilla priest main veteran can pretty much do a full instance run without drinking at all. Just saying, if ppl levelup in instances with some BIG aoe pulls, you are going to drink after each pull anyways.
---
If you were doing a normal run, yeah you can keep going ~endlessly. Just need to drink after boss fights.
---
this.

Being a noob is a huge part of the experience!

Not as much as getting to 40, and 41, and 42, and 30, and 31, and 32, etc. faster does.  Nobody "grinds for their 40 mount" that is serious about maxing. You just keep leveling and eventually your mount isn't expensive anymore. Usually around level 43.
---
Why would the hype fade now? If it fades, it will be after release.
---
Dont listen to him, you can check if you are in combat in Classic. Macro Conditionals are a thing. Only certain things like "range" or checking if the target already is affected by a buff/debuff dont work. 
---
I suggest you to read up on them: 
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro\_conditionals](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_conditionals)
---
You cannot hold people accountable for the dicks of their fathers.
---
It will be like this. For like a months. Dont think most retail players will actually switch to classic for their main game. Some of them will for sure but mostly the unsubbed will come back.
---
Yea that is where it falls over a bit I ideally would want it more aimed at only affecting PVE for the example you gave of pally tank that is the ideal however I have no idea how it can be implemented for things like ret. It would be very hard to make the sets with a classic feel as if you created them to only affect npc characters then that would most likely make it feel non-classic.

I'm going Skinning and tailoring on my druid.  A couple of tailoring recipes require leather, and as others say it's good vendor trash.

As a tailor you'll have amongst the best bags and you'll have competetive healing gear throughout the leveling process.

This always makes me laugh.

I see your stitches and raise a Son of Arugal.
---
People who minmax will make sure to have enough gold for their mount when they hit 40. You're missing out on 60% movement speed for three levels. That's huge.

Hah, look at this dork who thinks the flag does anything in the outdoor arena.

Blizzard have made it so everyone in the world owns wow (except for the newest expansion). All you need for Classic is a sub.

Those are really powerfull change... Being in full BiS before and after 1.10 is like a 20-30% increase of power.
---
Not exactly what you are asking for but the most detailed guide would be on www.joanasworld.com, he is actually making full step by step guides for every class/race combo. I like to follow this spet by step but just reading what he does and where he goes will help a lot.

Oh...

You need to do something else.
---
Same day? That Wednesday/Thursday? Or whenever it was. Can't remember what day it was exactly
---
Honestly, if it is needless running you should not try to catch up with him. Just say you already got the totems down but the tank insist on going out of range for no reason and see the shitstorm that is melee losing their WF dps. They'll tell the tank to get his ass back in no time.
---
I'm not ignoring that's all you're talking about, because that's what I'm talking about as well.
---
The only way bears have less downtime is if you're measuring it per time instead of the proper way of per mob.
---
Yeah, but why not just give the cloth to some other tailor so that he craft the bags for you, and the gear too ? Or are you planning to use this skill at level 60 ? Sellings bags or stuff? Otherwise you could go mining or herbalism for more money...

Thing is im not looking for step by step guides. There are THOUSANDS of those around. Im just looking for info for all the zone - just the info.

-Ancient horde wisdom
---
A lot of great advices here, but I want to add some advices as well:   
---
Doing some research on classes in classic before launch is smart. When I started in Vanilla I falled into the trap of leveling new toons once i hit 20, 30 or 40. Basically I just started new ones because I could never decide, and wanted to test them out. That made me never hit lvl 60 in Vanilla, which I regret. So, narrowing down the classes that interests you before launch could be wise, and try to stick with your decision up to level 60. If you then decide you want to try something else, by all means go for it. But try to get your first toon to 60 before making huge decisions.
---
Yeah, I was looking for a BS guide and the one I found the numbers don't line up properly at all...
---
Hopefully you respond. If not I'll ask this question somewhere else in a few days. Back in classic was ele or enhance shaman a better dps? Or since one is melee one is ranged is it harder to compare them?
---
Which faction is better for a feral tank?  Alliance is pve ez mode.  Horde has more threat issues, which better opens the door for feral tanks.   Alliance has insane pally buffs that help to enable kitty dps.  Horde brings less druids to raids.
---
Orc- Male for Warrior or Hunter Female for everything else
---
Troll - Male for melee/hunter, Female for casters
---
Undead - Male
---
All depends on the Class and animations. Orc female rogue is the best.
---
I will be playing a warlock and I don't want warlocks to do as much damage as mages.
---
I'm there for utility and decent enough damage.
---
I want to be a phat POM Pyro mage. Going horde. Tell me the best race, downsides and upsides of such a choice. I plan to PVP alot.
---
His answer is still true because of his modifier.
---
great vid mate, any chance of getting an addon list for your UI thanks.
---
Not sure why this was downvoted, it's completely true. Gnomes and Tauren move at the exact same speed, but because we humans perceive speed as movement relative to body size, the gnomes FEEL more nimble even if they're actually not.
---
Question about rogue from someone who never played Vanilla.
---
I want to focus on daggers but most of the guides seem to heavily favor swords. Are daggers a viable choice?
---
I will be with a guild trying to progress PvE content weekly and also doing PvP in between raids.
---
No, it's June. Go set down in your recliner and I'll get you some prune juice, Grandpa.
---
Dang, nice work!
---
Linl?
---
Maybe, considering how much the Chinese adored classic I wouldn't be surprised with numbers like that coming about.
---
 At the end of the day it's all guess work and I could miles off.
---
Oh look, another original "man, BfA sure sucks, am I right guys???" post.
---
Jesus, that actually sounds pretty nice... Being old isn’t so bad, I guess.
---
nice work friend
---
I'm really not sure what they expected from the guys who did the Hotel Mario cutscenes.
---
WoW , nice Job :)  
---
Going to use some of them in Discord server, thx !
---
&gt; there's no reason to go join a guild with 90 other people trying to take your spot every day just for the sake of it.
---
How is "playing with people who enjoy the game way the same way you do" not a reason?
---
Thanks! Sure, which parts are you interested in?
---
What the hell are you talking about? All power to the mighty bananadin!
---
I'd keep tailoring on a druid.  I plan on healing at end game, and BiS for druid healers requires tailoring.
---
Mining and herbalism is going to be heavily contested in the first few weeks and will drastically slow down my leveling.  It'll cause me to fall behind the curve.
---
Mages and warlocks wear alot of plain frost/shadow spell damage gear for pve which completely lacks stamina, so no, they cannot pvp in that. Warriors/rogues/hunters are better of there.
---
How many people are farming raids so a ret paladin can get a dps set?
---
They probably didn't. That's an Ogre Juggernaut, which the Horde used in WarCraft 2. It could've very well been salvaged, since Stormwind had recently been razed, and they probably used Westfall and Elwynn as the points where they began sailing north.
---
You painted Orggrimmar wrong.
---
Makes sense.
---
And for a really causal player like me, not planning on raiding nor leveling quickly, would you advise me to just make other people craft me some levelling gear instead of picking the crafting profession mysel ?
---
The most elegant route to take would be to have both ‘no changes/legacy’ servers, and ‘classic+’ servers I think. Everyone could be happy then. 
---
Personally I’d be more excited for the latter, but I completely understand why some people would be cautious and would prefer no changes.
---
Like always it's in the little things
---
Pet micro, don't kill it for no reason
---
Mana management, don't just spam but spam in the right phase/moment, we go oom pretty fast
---
Managing deadzone in pvp
---
Using all abilities, distracting shot kite + FD for example is an often overlooked tool that can save a tank in dungeons/raids, hunters have quite a lot of these "useless" abilities that people forget about (disengage and eyes of the beast are more examples). 
---
Using your melee attacks properly, in pvp and pve the melee is much more relevant then people give credit for. 
---
Enabling luck mode for improved concussive shot and wing clip, very hard to master
---
Using both melee and auto shot swing timer, moving in and out or on a near and far mob. 
---
The list goes on...
---
Are they shutting this server down? I jsut started playing on it
---
Our favourite monotone youtuber :D
---
Since there is no support for auto-downrank addons like in Vanilla, did they at least made it possible to buff lower level players and game auto-use the correct rank? I mean as a level 60 mage I may wanna buff with intellect a level 30 Priest.. Do I have to open my spellbook and look for the correct rank? Or I can use the highest rank and the game will buff him automatically with the correct rank?
---
"How do you kill that which has no life?"
---
I, too, got hooked on this game because of my first Deadmines run. I didn't think a dungeon could be so amazing, long, and spectacular, and it really blew me away. I still remember rolling on the Lavishly Jeweled Ring as a warrior and winning it over a caster because I was absolutely stupid and didn't realize that even though I had no rings and it was an upgrade, I had no business rolling on it over a caster.
---
Killing a mob faster doesn’t mean you will level faster.
---
For example. If your spamming shadow bolt as a warlock your leveling wrong. Burning all your mana to kill a mob in 5 seconds means you now have to sit down for 20 seconds to regain that mana. If you killed the mob in 10 seconds while using like 10-15% of your mana you can just life tap while moving to the next mob and have 0 downtime.
---
Now you could say you take more damage because your in combat. In this situation the damage difference received is not of importance. You can simply shift out of bear after 3-5 kills and cast regrouth and rejuv and then shape shift back in and be able to get an instant maul off, because bear starts with 10 rage to maul with.
---
You can then also say that even then you can use cat. The difference here is that cat starts with 0 energy. And for the damage to be better at lv 20-25 in cat you need to have around 80 energy according to kargoz Druid speeleveling guide. This means if you want to do what I described above, you must also wait for 4 energy ticks which is ~6 seconds.
---
This means that even though your taking damage in cat, hopping out to heal is more punishing than doing it in bear form due to how rage vs energy behave.
---
All of this is only possible because you get your out of combat mana regain while in combat because attacking in bear/car does not count as casting and therefore means you gain mana regain in shape shifts. The only time you pop out to heal is when you are at max mana so you can use the bar while it isn’t capped out. In cat this is unstainable at lv 20-25 if you don’t wait for energy.
---
The only reason cat becomes better is front shredding. But that won’t be in classic, so I’ll probably play bear till lv 30 ish now.
---
Hahaha this is too true
---
From what I know daggers are viable at AQ+ content. But still if you are alliance, human racial is very powerful to consider going daggers even in AQ+ content. If you are horde though, then I guess you can go daggers!
---
I'd rather break both my legs around launch time so I can just sit around and play for a few months cx
---
IT GONNA be So FuN!!! 
---
I didn’t not expect this 
---
and it was just a different thing to live in the wow world after the magic was pruned and squished out of the game. Vs this moment of pre amble to the second season of this game opening for us
---
I can't even grow a neckbeard, my small amount of hair doesn't go down there...
---
What's a gf btw?
---
By that definition, Overwatch is a RPG.     
---
Even Sonic is a RPG since you can play Sonic or Tails (and the difference is not just cosmetic).
---
all :)
---
Undead because will of the forsaken. Enough said :P
---
[This](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level_(old)?direction=next&amp;oldid=544034) doesn't contain Z but hope it still helps.
---
Teach me
---
WoW is still going to be hard for the *average* player, the kind that isn't going to see much raiding, if any at all.
---
For the sort of people that can clear Mythics, Vanilla leveling will be a minor adjustment.
---
So there is no modern RPG game. So by definiton what is the WoW game? Would you please contact Blizzard and all the other studios that made Pokemon, Final Fantasy, etc. To just stop calling it RPG? Thanks. Just so people don't confuse the term RPG anymore.
---
I never said its not fun, i said its inefficent. More efficency = more time for Work/School when you're trying to stay in a top-raiding guild and still need the AV Exalted Items.
---
You can go Sub specialisation with daggers. One of the fastest leveling spec. Improved Ambush + Remorless killer gives your Ambush around 99% crit chance. So you go from mob to mob literally doing 40-60% of mobs hp on opener hit. Also you get the Preparation and Improved Sap talents which are HUGE (2 blinds, 2 sprints, 2 evasions and 2 vanishes - yes please :)
---
Am I the only one who thinks that this kind of “vertical progression” does come with huuuuuge disadvantages?
---
**1.** **Balancing      of PvE and PvP** 
---
In classic there is almost no class which is bad at everything (I'm sorry Boomkins). Each Class/Spec in great in one Aspect of the game. Example: Ret and Feral are not good in Raid DPS, but they are very good in PvP. If you know buff their raid dps to be on parse with a rogue/furry warri you risk destroying PvP. In Addition to that: If a ret does the same dmg as a Rogue/warri/mage, the “optimal” class in raids will be rets. They don’t just deal the same dmg, they bring buffs, bubbles, Lay on hands etc. (combat rezz for druid). It’s very hard to balance things out that way. They tried a solution to this several times with resilience, super high stamina etc. They did a good job in legion doing that (somewhat decent) and everybody cried out for having the Same spec just with a different skin. Just Imagine a Spriest not going oom somewhat fast, he will be melting a whole AV within seconds, the wave will start small, but will overtake everything. (You know because AV is melting).
---
**2. Is players in charge of deciding a good thing?**
---
Most of the classic community seems to be “older” now, with jobs and other responsibilities. How long do you think will it take to implement some “small” changes to make their live just a little bit easier?
---
**3. Convincing people to do content which is not an upgrade.**
---
Of course, you are in your raiding guild since TBC and you know all of them personally. That’s a different thing, I will now talk about the “fresh starters”. Why should a tank farm several consumes a week to prepare for a raid which has not even the chance of having an upgrade for him? If you run raids just to make a “not optimal spec” decent, just take the better one and deal with it. If you know get the argument: “well in a guild you work together to achieve a goal for the team!” If you would want to achieve the goal for the Team, you would take the optimal spec “for the team”. 
---
**4. All of this MY Opinion, which we should** 
---
I hope you guys all see that this is just my opinion about the topic, and I hope it is somewhat understandable. It’s easy to say “yeah, just do it like OSRS” without thinking about all the consequences which come with it. If you give a reasonable attempt to all of this, you are welcome to tell me. 
---
5. Please argue reasonable
---
I beg you to answer me reasonable and not with stuff like "Blizz will know what's good" "it will be fine".  Thanks for your attention, I hope we get a good discussion going.
---
Probably look through your spellbook but don't quote me
---
Where do I start the quest-chain at?
---
People who play a sub-optimal spec won’t have prio over others who actually dedicate themselves when it comes to BRE in 99% of cases. I agree though (mostly because I’m not playing warrior this time around :p)
---
Dark Edge is a single target disorient with a low proc rate, armor pen works on all targets and a warriors function in pvp is to pressure and control. Armor pen on all your attacks against all targets is worth much more. I don’t remember the exact numbers, but 1.12 BRE with 3 stacks equals ridiculous dps. It is hands down much better and arguably just as good as MoM for certain situations if the proc rate is what we think it is (which we have good reason to believe). 
---
For 1v1/duels, I like think dark edge even beats MoM/ashbringer, I never got to play with anything but BRE though
---
They are the best flag carriers besides that you need them for CR and Innervate.
---

To be fair, hunters use anything :)
---
Twinkin is just dumb anyways, twinks just don't wanna get rekt by warriors
---
Daggers are viable at all stages but just not complete min/max, keep your eye out for the MC +dagger skill gloves
---
Regarding point 3, this happened in actual Vanilla/TBC, before streaming existed. I still remember players and guilds from 2007 (it was TBC, but there was still a lot of that sense of identity/community, especially early on).
---
Since this thread seems fairly safe for unpopular opinions: I think that classic+ should use TBC content.  It saves a great deal of design time.
---
Leave the level cap at 60.  Re-itemise everything to be mostly sidegrades (T5 = T3, perhaps).  Remove flying and modify a little bit of terrain.  Redo all the recipes to use old reagents (or make the reagents drop in both worlds at least).
---
You have a fairly quick and easy classic+ with lots of new content.
---
The only big problem that I see is that the dungeons are all linear, which some people wont like.
---
Don't know if they are planning anything nefarious or just doing a basic stat squish to levels, but I do know it's gonna be hilarious to see people panic that don't follow the news. They log in one day and see all their toons are 60, or whatever arbitrary number Blizzard decided to set it at, and then proceed to cry/rage and spam forums because they think they got deleveled.
---
That’s another way to make sure you have a good excuse :D
---
I made sure that I did not do any social stuff in the beginning of 2019. Now I have no friends, and my phone won’t be ringing while I level.
---
After all, it's all just a binary file in the end...
---
My Vanilla knowledge is rusty so don't take anything I say too serious but the base formula for scaling was 
---
&gt;(base cast time / 3.5 seconds) * (spell rank you use / max spell rank you know).
---
Base cast time = cast time before talents. For instant spells base cast time is 1.5 = GCD. For DOTs and HOTs you should also multiply it by 
---
&gt; base duration / 15
---
That was a general rule up to WotLK but there were exceptions like soulfire.
---
Nobody knows what "meme" means anymore. You can't 'make' a meme, it's not just a (supposedly) funny image you whipped up in a minute. There are meme formats, but that's not the same thing.
---
Basically the internet is a shittier place now then it was when Vanilla was fresh.
---
Playing female characters is objectively better (granted to an extremely small degree), so yea I do.
---
For tanks there's very little difference, BoK is certainly very nice but it won't make it break your ability to feral tank.
---
Why isn't fire spec good? Maybe I have rose tinted memories of ganking ppl with fire spec.
---
It's gotten this weird meme status. Before raids you just make sure you have enough to make a few cookies or an emergency summon.
---
No Warlock is expected to summon 30+ people to a raid entrance. Bar a reasonable reason for a delay everyone makes their way to the raid as a group or gets replaced by someone who will.
---
Also there'll likely be 2-3 other Warlocks to share the load.
---
You're getting downvoted to hell, but you're only a bit wrong.
---
WoW is a CRPG the same kind of way The Bard's Tale or Wizardry is. There are characters, they have fights, their numbers go up, there is some kind of overarching story.
---
It's not an RPG in the sense that most of the time you are solo PvEing and you make no (or almost no) choices that represent your character's personality. You could be a noble Tauren shaman, but if the most xp/hr you can get if from testing new biological weapons on prisoners for the Undead you will totally be doing it. And vice versa, you could be a creepy war-criminal undead sadistic freak but if the nice cow-man says to go investigate some environmental vandalism because it is making the turtles sick then off you go, Doctor Undead Doolittle saving the little furry endangered species.
---
And in a raid or a 5-toon group you will rightfully get yelled at if you "roleplay" anything other than "competent tank", "competent healer" or "DPS who waits for sunders".
---
There's a bit of scope for roleplaying in PvP, you can be a red-is-dead malignant jerk griefing everyone you see or a relative pacifist, and I think that's legitimately something you could roleplay.
---
Yeah when classic hits, but the endgame is quite dead already. Atleast compared to before. But it's a perfect server to try before classic and it's a ton of people leveling.
---
after some months and people reaching 60 the game will die again.
---
Just wait for phase 2. Honor system but no BGs.
---
Hillsbrad is gonna turn into vietnam
---
majority of pvp servers are horde dominated. Generally those who wanna pvp is more likely to chose horde for some reason. So thats why Alliance have lower que times because any given time, there will be more horde trying to join battlegrounds than alliance.
---
Get with the times gramps, it’s one of the better features they introduced.
---
Literally me in TBC until Sunwell. [Those were interesting times](https://i.imgur.com/l9RMs3Z.jpg).
---
Planning on duoing with my girlfriend who is brand new to WoW, she decided to roll a healer(priest). I'm leaning more towards mage for  pvp and such, however I heard warrior is insane with a priest. Never tanked before however, and I would rather dps. So what would you guys suggest?
---
This guy get's it
---
Needing a different set of gear for a different spec is kind of a fundamental part of the game, and has been forever until pretty recently...
---
 [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) 
---
you can check here the BiS items for rest druid for every pve stage.
---
Back in the day you did indeed have to pull out the lower rank from your spell book.
---
Totems and that 5 min cd self buff,lighting shield or how was it.  Nonstop have to rebuff,that somehow really isnt my cup of tea:d
---
Class loyalty runs much deeper than faction loyalty to me. I might be in the minority, but when I main a class, faction is a secondary.
---
&gt; BFA was the fastest selling WOW expansion of all time, so clearly its better than Vanilla/BC/WOTLK right?
---
Excuse me? Fastest.. selling. Fastest selling to what? 2 copies? From all retarded benchmarks you chose the cherry lol.
---
WoD pvp was the best pvp period
---
What about Kingdom Hearts? You take on the role of Sora. On wikipedia it's classified as an RPG. Please contact Square Enix. They should stop calling it that.
---
While you're at it, call the Pokemon Company. They call their main series RPG. Even though you cant make any decisions in the game for character development.
---
SWTOR is like WoW. Call EA.
---
I personally think a softer form of resilience (or much more Stamina) would be great. 
---
With that you award people for being good in PvP by making the speccs balance around PvP.
---
And award top tier raiders with top tier raid dps gear. Which is ONLY decent in pvp and not amazing. The gap should not be too big of course, but I think it would be easier than just trying to balance everything at the same time.
---
I seem to be very alone with this opinion because raiders like to own the people who don't raid (which makes sense). I still don't think this is good, but I understand why people like it.
---
we got 2 months and its a easy target
---
Hes a lvl 63 max
---
I guess the first thing to do is define a 'try-hard' since I don't know if there is an agreed on definition.  So, from Wikipedia:
---
&gt; A person usually of little talent who tries hard to succeed, especially through imitation, usually to gain fame or popularity.
---
In this definition, I would say that you are correct.  The most 'try-hard' individuals will be in mid-to-lower tier guilds, where they look up the best builds/gear/strats/ect for their guild and look like a very knowledgeable person, even though they are merely parroting what others have already figured out.
---
While that might seem odd to call out this 'try-hard' for parroting when so much of the game is already 'solved', there will be a lot of adapting and fine tuning once Classic launches since most of the 'solutions' for Classic came from Private servers.  Private servers that were using best estimates, or even outright false, numbers to try and emulate the game.  
---
So, the top guilds will be ones that are able to understand the mechanics and adapt their strategies to the new reality, where as the 'try-hards' will be waiting for those strats to become public and merely parrot them.
---
Play what you like, man. You can always differentiate in other ways.
---
Leveling with daggers is a bit challenging, as you don't get the talents required for dagger to work right off the bat, and since you are likely going to be leveling alone your target will constantly be facing you which prevents you from backstabbing them.  
---
Also there are a number of outstanding 1h swords that can be easily obtained from dungeon quests as you level.  While I fully recommend you experiment, and perhaps focus on daggers at 60, I believe leveling as swords is far far easier.
---
There's also that feeling of being a superstar. If you're a good player in an otherwise bad guild, you'll look like a god, but if you're a good player in a very good guild, you'll just be another raider.
---
This is nonsense. A good MT doesn't even need to talk on voice.
---
&gt;Dwarf Mage got scrapped at the last second. The Blink spell icon is a Dwarf Ma
---
WTF, I was blind during 15 years !
---
8.2 will release in a few weeks. Classic will come when a lot of people are getting tired of the new stuff in BfA.
---
I dont even keep up with retail wow but because i look at classic wow reddit, google has stalked muh stuff and showed me this video where apparently they are going to be down-levelling in retail wow, i dont know what the highest level is atm but its pretty kewl
---
Yeah going Horde 100%. Whole reason to play rogue is to kill the Alliance not join them XD.
---
Good to hear they can hold their own at AQ
---
They should have shut the shit down years ago.  Its technically illegal
---
You won't have any buyers for those early on
---
I wasn't hyped at all. I've done almost all of the content I'm interested in on pservers, the one exception being naxx, as I quit after AQ.
---
Then all of a sudden, I got dragged back in, and I'm suddenly so hyped for the magic of this 15 year old game.
---
Yeah the prep and burst is what drew me to it. That's always been how I felt rogues should play, heavy frontloaded burst with a couple tricks up their sleeves to bail out.(Vanish, blind, etc. like you say)
---
Happy to hear it can work out
---
I play on vanilla private server for over 1 year now, it feels so great, nothing regretted. Tried retail, later expansions couldnt keep me long, vanilla is the one for me.
---
Eh. Jump, and target something new while in the air, the resume strafing maybe
---
No love for sm armory?
---
Looks good :-)
---
Warlocks are very under represented and should be in very high demand especially on Alliance side because of WotF and Tremor Totem.
---
I've watched literally everything I could find. I should be disgusted with myself for wasting this much time. Yet, I am weirdly proud. I guess I am already in the classic mindset. XD
---
If you focus on pve:
---
\- play NE/Troll otherwise it doesnt matter.
---
\- Be hit capped by spec or geared.
---
\- Don't clip your autoshot
---
\- Dont use serpent sting
---
\- Dont go Survival, it will never reach the dps of an MM spec and you won't buff you group anymore.
---
\- Take a wolf pet for the AOE buff
---
\- Learn how to use your pet, it can survive most raid fights.
---
\- Don't clip your autoshot.
---
\- Never clip your autoshot.

that is good enough for what you are asking. its about what mobs to grind, but those zones will have quests for that level range too.
---
Molten Core looks the best
---
Let's wait and see, shall we?
---
You're not wrong but you can easily find  yourself in a situation where you've got low First Aid skill and can't skill it up because the level of mobs you're at don't drop linen anymore.
---
Bandages are great for those who have ways of stunning or immoblising mobs as they can be used in combat in a pinch.
---
Yeah not gonna bug me being slightly below top. Just wanted to be sure I wouldn't be a drag on the group, either during raid or by taking significantly longer to level.
---
Will def look for the gloves, thanks for the tip
---
He should be cancelling mind control earlier, as soon as he jumps off the bridge. Fall damage resets when the MC breaks, so letting it break automatically when ppl fall out of range actually reduces the fall damage taken by a lot.
---
Also, have my Silver
---
No, it fucking sucks
---
An integral part of Vanilla, and any good MMORPG, is being able to instantly look at someone and see their skill level/time investment into the game.

The problem with your "advice" is that gold is a lot harder to come by and water is a lot more expensive. So unless you had a shitton of mage water available, you end up at a sizeable net loss for the dungeon overall as Cynric42 pointed out. Retail is not classic.
---
6th grade me can confirm I was the useless night elf Hunter in AV
---
&gt; Bruh if you think anyone is going to give a shit about 8.2 for more than a day I want what you’re smoking
---
Raiders will give a shit for a while. As we always do. But you only have a lot of stuff to do in the game the first few weeks after a new patch, then it settles down to the same old raidlogging kind of thing, maybe log in and do some dungeons every now and then. 
---
It looks like classic will release just as 8.2 is starting to settle down, so that's pretty good timing.

Nice work! My favourite has to be Zul' Gurub
---
FD + Trap has been mentioned but I rarely see people talk about FD + Trinket swap. 
---
Before pull, have your on-use trinket equipped (Devilsaur Eye, Earthstrike etc.). Use it at the start of the fight then once the buff has expired, FD &amp; switch it for your 2nd standard trinket (Blackhand's, Royal Seal...). You can use a trinket swap addon to make it easier. During trash pulls you can also be constantly switching trinkets in/out as they come off CD. Not only does it make Hunter more engaging to play, but the other hunters in your raid will start to wonder why you're doing so much more dps than they are ;)
---
GL!
---
It's no big deal at all.
---
More honor would be completely meaningless since you are competing with your faction.
---
Everyone gets +20% means you will need 20% more to get into the same bracket.
---
Why would you be proud of not knowing about something that you don't know what it is?
---
I'll never forget my stv experience. A gnome rogue ganked me for an hour and I ganked him back on my orc Hunter. Then we both waved at each other and went back to questing. Weirdly our little display at peace solved stv questing issues for like a whole two days. And just as I dinged 39 and left I watched 10 horde players demolish like 5 alliance. All I thought was, "well time to get the fuck out this hell hole." 15 years later all I want in life is to go back.
---
Feels cliquey
---
You can always give it a quick little jump, let go, click on target and continue where you left off, but I agree. I use a combination of WASD and QE (default binds) to move around when I do different things, so I can essentially play the entire game with just my left hand. It's just less convenient.
---
Sources on that are hard to come by. Blizzard made their sub numbers private a few years ago, but the last they reported, the active player base was very low - which is why many people point to 4x as many subs in vanilla as compared to retail.
---
However, some estimates based off of scanning each battlegroup’s active population, claim the active retail player base is as low as 400k. 
---
Regardless of what is true, it’s generally recognized that retail is seemingly failing, in comparison to nearly all of the previous expansions,
---
No you can't, because of sharding.
---
Fire is fine, but early raid content MC, Ony, and BWL are all filled with fire immune bosses and mobs, so you literally cannot play fire in those raids.  
---
Pom Pyro really really kinda needs one of the activated spell trinkets.  Either TOEP from MC or the ZG hero charm.  ZG isn't until phase 3, and MC being a frost only means you would need to respec to get a shot at it.  
---
Early on pvp mages are quite squishy and don't yet have enough spell power to consistently explode people.  Frost works better at first because it allows you play at bit control orientated and iceblock+barrier greatly increase your survival long enough to get out spells to kill someone. 
---
Early fire is viable for pvp, I would however suggest a scorch/blastwave orientated spec that relies more on quick hitting fire spells to maximize impact and allows you to keep moving.  
---
In terms of race there is only undead and troll, Undead is clearly best for pvp.  Fear is extra powerful in vanilla as the damage required to break it is really high, in the case of a mage basically your whole HP.  Any unbroken fear against something like a lock or shadow priest will basically kill you.  Frost can afford to be other races, but for fire focused mage undead is near requirement.   
---
Troll has an activate haste, but it is quite small unless you use it at low life.  It can be useful in pvp, but is mostly a pve talent.
---
I Always ran with a mage in vanilla when I played a resto shaman but I take your point
---
Your demand should adjust for popularity. As such, warlock is in way higher demand because it is way less played.
---
There's been seven expansions to WoW. I can't even imagine level progression from 0 to 60 spread across ALL SEVEN of them.
---
Even if they do something like... base game 1-30, then 10 per expansion, that still adds up to 100.
---
Well yeah that's pretty accurate lol
---
Every class benefits from a healer, some (warrior) more than others. Play what you want to play. Mage + priest is fine. Warriors dont have to tank if you dont want to.
---
Rogue.
---
Dungeons and small raids like CoT and Karazan could literally be seamlessly thrown in too. They are even already in the game world. One could easily add alternative tier sets for currently unpopular specs. 
---
Not sure about ssc/tk/... tho, they would add a ton of loot and apparently there isn't much room for more after naxx, stats wise.
---
So there is no official source then? Ok can be dismissed
---
I saw that when I played on Nost, I didn't really like it at first and made me wrinkle my nose, but actually I think as a long as people are clear and upfront with it, it makes sense and is no big deal.
---
&gt;In this situation the damage difference received is not of importance. You can simply shift out of bear after 3-5 kills and cast regrouth and rejuv and then shape shift back in and be able to get an instant maul off, because bear starts with 10 rage to maul with.
---
Let me stop you right there and tell you what's incorrect at about that sentence.
---
A. Damage received is super important as that's the only thing contributing to "downtime"
---
B. The way of playing bear you're describing already has more downtime than playing in cat does
---
C. Bear does not start with *any* rage unless you spec furor, which you definitely don't at such low levels.
---
&gt; This means if you want to do what I described above, you must also wait for 4 energy ticks which is ~6 seconds.
---
Sure, if you don't realize you can spend a single global in combat cast rejuv while losing no energy doing so.
---
&gt; All of this is only possible because you get your out of combat mana regain
---
There's no such thing as "out of combat mana regen"
---
&gt; The only reason cat becomes better is front shredding. But that won’t be in classic, so I’ll probably play bear till lv 30 ish now.
---
Again, you have yet to explain where bear gets it's benefit from, because cat spends less time healing, less time between pulls and does more damage, which other factor contributes to leveling speed?
---
Oh levelling as daggers will be an awful experience, I do not advise it at all, I was speaking purely from a group PvE perspective.
---
*because nobody can really 1v1 a rogue in vanilla if they get to start the fight. Your 15 years of rogue experience has nothing to do there bud.
---
Will have a look, thanks!
---
Still something i guess! Cheers!
---
It's always a relief to find a trustworthy enchanter or alchemist.
---
There is no option because there was no option in 1.12, actually there never was an "option" afaik, it was just implemented with 2.0 where it became a baseline thing.  
---
    
---
Your best bet is an SCT addon, functions just fine for tracking your output.
---
Try-hard in video games generally has a different connotation. It's often a player that is not actually part of a world first guild or other similar objective, but acts like they are, and plays as if they are. They tend to generate stress where none is needed in social environments.
---
A try hard is someone who'll never play a non-meta hero in Dota and will always run the cookie cutter spec in all situations, while still playing at a skill level that could be classified as average or maybe above average.
---
Making your own is always cheaper and if you plan on doing dungeons then you'll need at least average gear.  You'll get your mount quicker this way and once you're 60 and have an epic mount, leveling mining/herbalism will be much faster.
---
In the first few weeks, herbs and ores won't sell on the AH. So you'll either vendor it or keep it in your bags.  Either way that's lost potential income. 
---
If you plan on doing end game pvp you'll need engineering, but that can be levelled once you're 60.
---
I would totally welcome it as long as they don't corpse camp (which the ooga gang do not do)
---
We need alliance versions too though.  Gnomes, obviously.

I'm a druid.  Regrowth is a part of my feral rotation.
---
r/betterwithoutcontext
---
Actually yeah I was a holy pally on vanilla and had the same spec and mostly the same gear in pvp and pve. Dps was pretty mediocre though.
---
Have someone craft the gear you want. Preferably someone from your guild or someone you know. For leveling gear, it's not very common to get ripped off with the mats, but the danger is always there. So having a crafter you know and have worked with previously is pretty huge.
---
Also as a bonus, if you supply some stacks of leather to them while they are leveling their profession, they will probably be much more eager to help craft your gear as well.
---
If it is best is slot, typically the fact that is the wrong armor type will not matter and you will roll/get prio equal to the class  that is it the correct armor type for.  
---
Early on in MC, it looks like the only BIS cloth for druid is from pre-raid, most of the MC leather is quite good, but that means paladins/shamans will be rolling for it as well.  
---
By AQ40, phase 5, the cloth itemization is clearly better, and this website at least http://www.wowclassicbis.com/  has you as being in more cloth then leather.  
---
The good news is you'll still get your tier sets since no one else needs them, if you are worried about having a higher armor set for pvp or world use.
---
Absolutely not, it would make warlock summoning esentially worthless for a group.
---
Seems like you're set for another 15 years at least!
---
Thanks mate! &lt;3
---
I prepared for that as well. Great minds think alike.
---
"Hey guys, what's up MadSeason here, back with another video for you." Such a cute man.
---
You seemed to do a good job breaking down my argument without looking at the source i described. If you could do that it would explain the benefits of bear. I don’t think I’m describing it correctly. If I was, people would of understood. 
---
Again the source is on YouTube and search kargoz vanilla wow Druid speed leveling guide. I don’t speak English well and have a shit time remembering names, so it is quite hard to describe the abilities and talents and what ranks you get them at and stuff off the top of my head while I’m at work on my phone.
---
God damn it, I knew I'd forget something. I'll add this when I can bring myself to look at these again haha.
---
Sure, it can be dismissed. Doesn’t mean it may or may not be true. I’m just sharing what seems to be the general consensus bro, not attacking you.

\* \*\*Semi-hardcore | PvE &amp; World PvP\*\*
---
\&gt;The Kor Kron Vanguard is an experienced World-PvP and PvE guild returning to Classic WoW.

---
🎯 \*\*What we are aiming for:\*\* Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
\&gt;We have been refining our methods to bring you the best possible experience of open world PvP. No previous experience required.
---
❓ \*\*What we expect of members:\*\*
---
\* As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire  to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.

📅 \*\*Our Raid Schedule:\*\* Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not to be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1 (CET/CEST).

No, killing blow is not required IIRC.
---
Whats your guess on x-realm battleground server pools?
---
Will it be realm type specified (PvE,PvP separated) or will they be in the same pool?
---
What about languages?
---
What a noob. While you were wasting your time with your girlfriend, I studied the raid.
---
What's with the down votes? What's wrong about killikg streamers? They exist for our entertainment. It's literally how they get paid.
---
Punished Saig?
---
Eh ? Pre-nerf Spirit of Aquementas basically gave healers anywhere from 50-80 mp5.
---
Yeah scholo is long af Brd is like 4 dungeons inside one, the dungeon game play is my fondest recollections. 
---
The fact is that you have to decide what kind of role you want to play and investigate it deeply. The game rewards inquisitive discipline. There was a feeling of being accomplished in a skill of a role, and players enjoyed explaining, and guiding fellow player types. Lore had been part of the site Tank Spot. 
---
Mages and hunters are your back line offense / clutch. Rogues and warriors can serve as front line. Tanks is its own special front liner. Warrior is about it although some very talented druids made wonderful feats. 
---
Healing is available for several with wide utility. Warlock feels more handy to the team in several ways while it is a little below mage for Boom power it is way more devious, so I chose it during most of the original season. I am now a tank but will main both. 
---
Directing the battle is also helped by crowd controlling, which is most potent for mage, rogue, and hunter. These are assists to the tank, just like dealing crazy damage to the right target at the right time. It’s all about organizing the threats to the group so things will be killed quick enough that the team lives. When I use the term clutch this is what I mean. The best moments from my memory are all CRAZY clutch wins on battles we seemed to be losing.
---
If you add summoning stones you make the ability of the warlocks to summon meaningless.
---
In vanilla you are not just your class you are your spec. Addig dual spec would completely destroy that.
---
/r/vore_irl
---
For all the flunkies who couldn’t make it in the Horde.
---
is this an out of season, april's fools joke?
---
fire spec was good but not pom pyro. There was an "elemental" build which was Fire/Frost build and utilized shatter with fire spells.
---
And both times they instantly fucked it up. BFA basically squished it all down to WotLK levels but as soon as you hit level cap, it was back to pre-squish (a bit over exaggerated, but not far off)
---
Yes, it's certainly top 3. And since it's not a drop and gaurunteed, I will be grabbing it.
---
What a shit shaman u r.  It takes 39 pts in the tree to get everything a Rshaman can make use of while healing.   There's a lot of shit you miss with just 21 pts.  
---
You would get smoked in healing like that, and your group utility is far less as well.
---
Gather people around questing and kill him as party of 5. The only noble thing to do. Put this miserable abomination to its end.
---
Back in the day there was addons that were able to chose the correct rank for you. That was because you could call the command "castspellbyname" which will be blocked in classic now.
---
Source?
---
Classic+ can’t exist without balance changes. Blizzard has constantly changed balance in each vanilla patch as new raid content and gear comes out.
---
Why would they not do the same for classic+?
---
Some classes are broken with just full t3, with 3.5 some specs would downright just dominate in pvp, and pve balance will just skew farther in the direction it was going.
---
Meme specs shining is also a slippery slope, of balance druids do as much dps as a mage, why bring mages when druids have a b Rez?
---
Ive not seen specifically that the genersl consensus was retail is 4x lower than vanilla was
---
I hope they will make this auto, since they dont want the auto-downrank addons.
---
People I won’t allow in the dungeon groups I form.. retri.
---
Real dps deserve not to have their gear stolen by meme’ers. 
---
Holy paladins however 🍆💦💦

Im guessing hes been ganked 1 too many times in stv

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**   
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
Orc is clearly best for horde, 25% stun resist is really hard to undervalue in pvp.  Pet damage is nice bonus.  
---
Alliance, NE is ok with shadowmeld but if a bit of a tech option in that in can be used to ambush people in very narrow situations.  
---
In group fights, or fights where you don't get to setup and defend first with shadowmeld, dwarf is better.  It clears viper from enemy hunters, bleeds off warrior, rogue poisons including blind, and is just flat armor for any melee that tries to kill you.
---
That's like 1 milion BFA sales + subs. It isn't jack shit compared to 10 million WOTLK sales.
---
**[Horde] [EU] [PVE-Server]**
---
**&lt; Wipe in progress &gt;**
---
&lt;WIP&gt; is a freshly formed guild, created by people tired of drama. Raiding should be a fun and social event, where difficulty comes from killing bosses, not from navigating a Game of Thrones - like maze of officer politics. So if you want a guild that aims for steady (but non-hardcore) raiding progress, read on!
---
We aim to raid on **Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays 21:30-00:30 EU Server Time (20:30-23:30 UK time).** Our aim is to eventually clear all the content, and we have experienced players and raid leaders to guide people towards that goal. We will be happy to teach newer and inexperienced people, all we ask is that you approach raiding and preparation with effort and dedication, and show same respect towards other people (and their time) as they do to you!
---
We expect our raiders to attend most of the raids, however will be understanding if life gets in the way - just please let us know in advance, so we can adjust and prepare.
---
Our main 40man raids will use EPGP system for loot distribution, while our alt/20man raids will be rolling for items (barring a few exceptional items).
---
Most important rule of our guild is to follow Wheaton's Law: **Dont be a dick**.
---
(It is however perfectly fine, and at times expected to call someone else a dick!).
---
We are currently **open to recruit most of the classes and roles!** - and we always accept social applications from anyone willing to join us!
---
So if you're ready to hear immature jokes about toasters, have fun doing dungeons and quests with your guildies, and work towards good raiding progress - please come check us out!
---
Feel free to message me here or on Discord (Thirteenera#8084)
---
&gt;It’s not classic but it’s close enough to get a feel for the game and classes.
---
I beg to differ.  Some of the spells and abilities have the same name but that is where the similarities end.
---
Do not make a decision on what you'll play in Classic based on the current state of the game.
---
Pretty much, as long as it is stated in advance, I don't see the issue.
---
It's your choice to join. 
---
Only issue is when they go through the process of inviting people and then when everyone is ready suddenly say "so X is reserved". That is just a scumbag move.
---
And the second squish completely destroyed the demon hunter starting area because they forgot to rebalance that to account for the lower stats (maybe that's been fixed by now. Haven't checked)
---
It's been a living nightmare trying to level as Horde anyway - i'm around 22 and its taken forever because there's like 3x5 man groups competing for every mob, level 60 alliance just camping Stonetalon, Ashenvale and Hillsbrad :o
---
Still enjoying it though
---
Distract shot on big packs so you get hit instead of the healer if shit goes down. 
---
Odds are you have better mitigation and the travel time will allow one mob to die so your tank is ready to taunt it off the healer once you feign.
---
It took me 30 LBRS runs to get on my Rogue on a private server. And that's a run that can take like 2 hours if you're not lucky when forming a group.
---
Getting both Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge and Tribal Guardian was significantly easier tham getting that stupid key.
---
I have one question: what exact patch version will WoW Vanilla run on? I know that it will be 1.13, and what we know so far that it will run on 1.12 patch. But I have question: will it be 1.12.1 or 1.12.2 or just 1.12.0? Is it confirmed somewhere?
---
I cannot find this info anywhere and it is killing me, because I want to play shaman and I believe that loosing skill in two-handed weapons after respecing was changed in 1.12.1.
---
Anyone?
---
You know that if that shit catches on fire you are a crispy critter right?
---
Yeah legion's classes were all pretty fun to play. The problem with modern wow expansions isn't really the moment to moment gameplay it's stuff like their being paradoxically pretty empty lonely experiences over the longer term unless you're on a Roleplaying server or have stuck with the same group of friends forever or something. BfA in particular is also very loud without saying very much.
---
HOLY FAK
---
I feel you, can't really stand most of the streamers anyway, so jolty and present and In YoUr FaCe with all their opinions and constantly repeating themselves, I'm a little done with that. Think as I'm getting to the end of the guides and mapping out my journey a bit as you will, I'm not sure what will happen. I'll háve to put the whole thing to the back of my mind. Maybe we'll try and see if we can enjoy our yearly vacation or something.
---
edgy shadow priest is always an option
---
Kb is only required for the drain soul mana regeneration buff from the talent.
---
Doing Armosmith questes was painfull even as a miner. I don't imagine do it again, on new fresh start server... never. I don't think that it's worth. You will wasted so many nodes for leveling this prof. I will not do it again.
---

I'd say deadmines questchain for leather and mail wearers. And after you kill VC he drops a letter that starts a new quest chain for seal of Wrynn. That everybody should get.

Here’s the binding I use with this to the bars

Arena was insane. I did do many 2vs2.

That is definitely a bad recollection tho. If you are in shadowform it won't let you cast. You need to do a macro to remove shadowform. It's the same for druids currently live.

Soooooo streaming, it's very little about "watching someone play a game" and much more about entertainment. Some people are entertaining because they are very skilled, others are just entertaining. Then there is also the conversation between the streamer and the audience. Imagine if you was a football fan and  could chat with your favorite player in real time and he would answer and share his opinions, while playing. Then there is also the fact that we can't even play Classic yet and it's interesting to see the gameplay.
---
&gt; Again the source is on YouTube and search kargoz vanilla wow Druid speed leveling guide.
---
I've watched that video and you know, it does the exact same thing I just told you you're doing.
---
It's using the same non-sensical argument that ignores all other factors and just says "if you switch out from cat form you'll have max energy, ergo bear is better", completely ignoring that:
---
A. You don't need max energy to kill stuff much more efficiently than you do in bear
---
B. You can switch out to heal while killing mobs and all it costs you is 1-2 cat autoattacks.
---
C. If you're using bear as your "fighting form" you're losing so much mana having to swap into cat to move around that it becomes completely unsustainable.
---
I’m probably going to do Armorsmithing tbh, I just like the idea of being a dwarf that deals in quality armor.
---
but I have to say that even with daggers you still spec into combat/Assassination for pve.. At least you will have your ambushes, but not a real pvp spec :P
---
It's totally justifiable to rip on the joke modern wow has become.
---
&gt; the OogaBooga gang
---
It's just "The Ooga gang" or "ooga brothers". All their names end in "ooga" (which would include booga, making it redundant to even mention).
---
Respect the Oogas. Get it right.
---
But if that's the reason that only makes you less "try-hard" than anything.
---
I'm sure at some point I'll have to hit that same ceiling, shouldn't be long now. Can't even wait to get a break like that, it might make the days fly by faster!
---
People who don't look at chat when they are in a dungeon, BG, or anything that should require some coordination are the worst kind of players.  If you aren't going to use the chat then seriously go play a single player rpg, and especially don't play WoW Classic.
---
I would do that if Q and E werent the most important bindings to use. Wish I had 6 fingers.
---
Ah yes all the evil shamans in the forums who laugh about paladins due to their interrupts and dispell. Meanwhile in a BG you have the idiot who frostshocks you on cooldown and probably didn't even buy purge. 
---
The other way is also valid. Lost count of the number of paladins who insist on watching their autoattack timer while the MS warrior is siting sheeped in a ice trap and the priest gets stunlocked to death by a rogue.
---
It’s almost impossible to learn anything until you’ve gone in and experience newness on which to develop curiosity. THEN the game has an extremely awesome rewarding path to take for discipline and skill+knowledge building

**&lt;MERCENARY&gt;** - Horde | US-East | RP-PvP
---
**Focus**- Experiencing the World of Warcraft while obtaining fortune and glory with a motley crew of hard lifes, lowlifes and no-lifes. If blizard does not launch classic with RP-PvP realms we will be rolling on whatever PvP realm the community decides is the unofficial NA RP-PvP realm. the PvP part is the most important part.
---
​
---
**Schedule**- Raid time currently projected for every other week, Mon and Tues from 1930-2300. This lets us hit two raid lockouts and get back to PvP, farming, and general tomfoolery for the rest of the week.
---
**Loot**-DKP
---
**Leadership**- Last played retail in Cata. Adults with no tolerance for wasting the group's time
---
**Membership**- Seeking people with a goals-based mindset who want to be in Azeroth to escape the overbearing culture of politics and memery that has invaded all of the internet this past decade. It does not matter if you are a MAGApede, a Hilldawg, a Bernout, a Fascist or a Communist. Can you get out of range of Rain of Fire and press buttons in something resembling the correct order? Fantastic, you're hired. Total noobs are allowed. Although leadership has extensive experience in private servers, expecting everyone to have played technically illegal copies of a 15 year old game is a stretch.
---
**Discord**- https://discord.gg/BDbpfjq
---
Come on by and say hi
---
Haha you're right, it's not the only thing I do all day, trust me, but most of the time inbetween real life happenings I just get back to it. But I'll be drying out on cintent soon and it's hopefully gonna be a more healthy kind of wait-out.
---
Thanks for taking the time. I'll take this all into account.
---
Blizz doesn't care about subs, the care about revanue. As long as people are buying $60 level boost and mounts they could care less abouts subscribers.
---
Back in the day they used Sub count as a marketing tactic but that's not a good strategy in this day in age.
---
Basically there's no point. Twitch veiwership basically already fills that roll as it partains to game "popularity".
---
What is.. a neck beard? I mean beard doesn't grow on your neck. At least mine doesn't
---
Or they didnt know what res meant and now its too late
---
Think there's still so much to do, to train, to explore even at 60. We will see, quite curious!
---
Nice!
---
Absolutely! I‘m enjoying my 3DS, play Rocket League and try some Singleplayer things like Witcher or so. It‘s fun!
---
So, I didn’t play since early MoP because Cata was already a big meh for me and it didn’t get better, i came back in Legion for 1 month to only realize the game changed in a way that doesn’t offer me anything anymore. Best time was WotLK and I will definitely only play Classic once it’s released and won’t check out Retail, I’m just done with it.
---
&gt; and will always run the cookie cutter spec in all situations
---
I guess it depends on what level you are on, but I would instead say that it's the guys complaining about the cookie cutter specs everyone is running and trying to show how much he knows by having the absolute optimal build or whatever.
---
Two months
---
and possibly some 'bank shoes' (shoes with runspeed enchant, is that in 1.12?)
---
&gt;a months
---
OMG so deep I literally cried :'(
---
SBEVE &lt;3
---
This.. I'll be levelling a tank when classic drops and will hold so much respect for this.
---
It will also be interesting to see if any BFA players try out classic and (as DPS) start randomly pulling shit in dungeons and get all teary and flounce when the instance isnt going fast enough from all the wipes they cause.
---
I reckon 5-6 dungeon attempts before those idiots get the gist. Classic, if anything, will instill the prinicples of teamwork into players once again and filter out the trash that can't handle that.
---
It's going to be beautiful.
---
Name: The Scarlet Crusade
---
Progress raiding mixed with RP and WPvP events 
---
NOTE: Our guild tabard will be the Scarlet Tabard so if you want to join post launch it's a requirement to be taken in 
---
I don't have much more to write for the moment. We seek people who can contribute to Raid progression but also don't mind doing RP and PvP events with the guild. We don't have much social stuff set up yet but if you have the long term patience and you are interested in roleplaying in a made up part of the Scarlet Crusade DM me here

And should you still be missing some rep after leaving, I am pretty sure there is enough  darnassu rep on the way to 40.
---
About point a watch 17:55 and it’s the first paragraph there. 
---
B I don’t understand what you mean by that.
---
C you can move and attack at the same time, so you don’t need to swap into cat to move 5 meters .
---
I’m the end this entire arguement is considering 20-25 a section that will take like 3 hours of your play time if your just going and going and going non stop. I really only stick to responding to people who assumed I said bear&gt;cat at all levels. Which isn’t what I was saying. I applause you for your understanding here. But at this point this is simply a preference thing than anything else.
---
This video and people I know have leveled different ways, all fast, just taking things in different orders and stuff like that.
---
Yeah but why should this be an effort. Streamers are at the end of the day gamers too. Who cares.
---
Join those groups, thats the whole point.   
---
Also, alliance also has lvl 60 hordes camping them.
---
Imagine actually watermarking your memes
---
I think reliving the content is great, but no one can replicate their life 15 years ago. I would main something different
---
Kill it with fire.
---
Yea, susanexpress workers
---
Ohh I see, thanks
---
Yeah it's you and me brother! And all these other weird unhealthy people. We might be overly hyped, but fucking it doesn't fucking matter please look the other way thank you yeah! CLASSIC WOW!
---
Actually there is a penality for spells under lvl20.
---
&gt;it doesn't smell like Retail because of the level squish
---
I don’t think you understand some things.  Level squish implies they take the 120 they have now and arbitrarily make it 60... that changes nothing about the core of the problems with BFA or retail in general.  I don’t care that the level cap isn’t 60 I care that the game is a fucking slot machine with no soul and time gates at every corner.  I don’t think a single person wants Classic just so the number next to their portrait doesn’t read 120.

World of Dadcraft
---
Hi all,
---
I am a father of a very energetic 2 year old and I am very much excited to start playing on classic. However due to having a little one this will be mainly casual. I am just wondering if there are other dads out there who originally played and are are planning on playing again but now with the debuff of being a parent which might slow their progress and only allow them to play causally.
---
If so, let me know and who knows, it might be a guild in the making! 
---
PS: I will be playing on a European PVP/PVE server
---
Hmm, perhaps. But to me it comes down to where this person is.
---
Are they pro/in a top guild/best player of their class? Sure, godspeed, that's legitimate.
---
Someone who doesn't seem to be playing much better than the average? Tryhard.
---
It's called that because it seems the person is trying really hard but not really getting anywhere, and I don't think it's about talent, more being too stressed about things.
---
I'm also 22 and I don't think it's too bad, I'm around 21hs /played, just a bit more than expected, I don't think it does that big of a difference in the long run, you just have to adjust your leveling-process a bit.
---
How so?
---
There is [this ](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level) list and [this](https://i.redd.it/rp2sa3ob7bv11.png) map
---
ALLY ALERT! 
---
FOR THE HORDE! :D
---
I finished BS on 260, don't have time to finish it. cost too much to level up. 
---
As a warr i would go engi + mining. 
---
I'm planing to start with mining/herb at start.
---
That plus the walking/running animation is slowed for larger sized characters which adds to the feeling of them being slow.
---
I would recommend watching this.

---
\*How STV will look
---
And my first line had...
---
&gt;  I don't know if there is an agreed on definition
---
Which is why I used wikipedia since it gave grounds for any argument I would make and would give some consistency to the discussion.  However, let us see how your definitions compared to the one from wikipedia.
---
&gt; not actually part of a world first guild or other similar objective....while still playing at a skill level that could be classified as average or maybe above average.
---
"...person of little talent..."
---
&gt; but acts like they are,
---
"...who tried hard to succeed..."
---
&gt; someone who'll never play a non-meta hero in Dota and will always run the cookie cutter spec in all situations, and complain about a person trying to tank as a paladin in a dungeon
---
"...especially through imitation..."
---
&gt; They tend to generate stress where none is needed in social environments.
---
"...to gain fame or popularity."
---
Your major points are all covered in the definition I pulled from wikipedia.  You merely added more parameters and context for the specific game the person is 'try-hard'ing in.
---
&gt;Honor system but no BGs.
---
omfg
---
Can it be a pretense for machiavellian leadership of the guild?
---
Not sure if I'm RPing warlock correctly.
---
True if big.
---
Never had a house to sell in the first place. I've always rented. Never been married, no mom to move into her house so guess classic is not for me. :(
---
people are hyped for starting playing. Once they start playing and after feeding that desire, it will dissappear (I think)
---
It's basically a non-issue. As long as you keep one shard bag full, it's plenty to start any raid. Nobody really expects you to provide hp or soul stones for everyone for every encounter.
---
lol in classic? fake news
---
**NA Horde PvP**
---
LGBT+ friendly only
---
I’m looking to make friends and find people to play with as Horde on a North American PvP server. I’ve played WoW on and off since 2006 and do not play BFA. I don’t have anyone to play with and although I look forward to making friends after launch, I’d like to make at least one good friend beforehand. 
---
I’m a trans woman so if you’re not totally cool with that I’m not for you. Looking for leveling/PvP/dungeon/exploring/bullshit buddies. I’m going to play rogue or shaman. I’d like to actually get to know each other and be friends, not just random people to group with! I’m East Coast, mid 20s, good player/no-lifer, never toxic, and lover of esfand and mizkif.
---
Nice, gj!!
---
&gt; and I don't think it's about talent, more being too stressed about things.
---
Depends on how you define talent. Not getting too stressed about things could be considered a talent. 
---
They are kind of bad because they don't focus on the right things. Knowing everything about everything isn't gonna help you if you still can't make the right decisions while playing. Anyway, I haven't actually met many of these people in vanilla. if they know what they are doing they tend to be pretty good players. There's tons of them in modern WoW though, where people are trying to play exactly like the pros or whatever, and then failing spectacularly because they are just not skilled enough to pull it off.
---
Not exactly what i had in mind, but close.
---
I remember there was a list of all the zones, saying stuff like:
---
"Barrens - level 10 to 25, but most quests happen around level 15, definetely don't come here before 12" (random numbers).
---
[Nicely, thanks.](https://imgur.com/xf9UpoP)
---
&gt; About point a watch 17:55 and it’s the first paragraph there. 
---
Yes, that's the point I'm talking about.
---
It's pretending that not having the upside of being able to frontload your damage means you have a downside, which simply isn't the case.
---
&gt;  B I don’t understand what you mean by that
---
I mean you can switch out to heal without losing any energy in doing so.
---
&gt; C you can move and attack at the same time, so you don’t need to swap into cat to move 5 meters .
---
You absolutely can (and should), but even doing that you're not always going to be in range of the next mob.
---
# &lt;Informal&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore]  MORNING EST
---
**INTRO:** This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. It does not matter if you are new to classic or a veteran, All I want are dedicated players willing to do what it takes to down bosses. If you can do this, I want you on the team.
---
**GOAL:**
---
\-week 3/4 MC clear
---
\-Clear all content quickly and efficiently
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)
---
\-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need. 
---
**LOOT:** Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.
---
**SCHEDULE:**
---
**RAID TIMES** \- EST, MORNING
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST
---
**RAID DAYS** \- MON / WED / THUR  
---
**CURRENT CLASS NEEDS**

---
It's a risk for sure. I've been taking classes to level 30 to decide my main and alts. Druid isnt for me, but I would have played it first because I was so sure I'd love it. Would have had to reroll in my mid 20s
---
Only other classes I've done are Priest and Paladin. Priest was surprisingly very fun. If I dont main it I'll at least have an alt for pvp or something
---
What about everything else I said?
---
It wont. I thought me wanting vanilla was Just my rose tinted glasses fucking with me, but after a stint on a private server i was more hyped than ever. Played pretty hardcore to lvl 36 and then i decided i should stop and put the hours in when vanilla drops.
---
My older brother continued playing tho and he had so much fun in raids like ZG. 
---
Its really not a hype, but that's ofcourse my opinion tho. For reference, im 28 y/o too.
---
Imagine being this anal about dungeon groups
---
This is an adventure game filled with vivid deliciousness for slow players. SO few games have all the way captured this feeling. A lot of games on Nintendo 64 did and some older pc adventure games. 
---
This game is an expansive environment that invites you to get to know it’s nuances, spend the time, practice repetition and discipline, and establish relationship cognitions and feel the rewards in your brain of this type of Educational Play. This is how our brains work. The game is masterfully designed so you can slowly gain that expertise of locations, enemies, your guildies, your role and skills, the entirety of the Zen when all these elements work together with your curiosity and mindfulness.
---
The game shattered the industry and pc gamers and gaming as we knew it for a real reason. It’s an innovative piece of important work that has basically never been matched or outdone yet.
---
They take up less space on your screen.
---
&gt; They log in one day and see all their toons are 60, or whatever arbitrary number Blizzard decided to set it at, and then proceed to cry/rage and spam forums because they think they got deleveled.
---
They DID get deleveled in that scenario though.  The point to an RPG (and an MMORPG) is character progression.  A regression isn’t good, wont look good, and certainly won’t feel good.  A squish, even just in the number alone with no power change, would kill retail WoW.  The retail community has put up with tons of crazy shit over the years but suddenly being 60 levels lower, even if just in name alone, would be the final straw.  The casuals who still play retail (not the raiders) are their biggest market share and those are exactly the people who’d feel the most anger by this.  It’d be an idiotic and astronomically crippling business decision.
---
Good point! If you don't like them, you can always make your own.
---
The good old SoC slot machine.
---
Waste your time carrying a meme’er who takes gear from good players if you want.
---
Couldn’t imagine being such a dick that i would waste people’s time and waste good drops, but then again I have empathy.
---
&gt;Fighting for quest mobs gets old and there are plenty of people WAITING to kill those elites on quest line ends.
---
Well, thats exactly what you are going to see in classic too, so get used to it.
---
Always shaman
---
Its like this for Years.
---
You're the meme'er, friendo
---
Alwaman.

Perfect. So there will be more flavours of players. I like it when some people fuck shit up with the best intentions. The more different opinions and builds the merrier, even when wrong.
---
I've had 1 character, from Vanilla until Legion, which was a Shaman.Not going trough dat hell again, what is called air and water totem quest chain :).
---
This time i will go for another hell which will be an Warrior, (starting on launch day)
---
“Mirror mirror, I am big kindergarten boy”
---
I think we’ll end this “talk” here. Goodbye
---
Data accumulation maybe but not interpretation
---
Of course. But making making fun of each other whether you're classic fan or retail one isnt cool. And i feel like this entire thread was made to make memes and joke of retail players.
---
Not terrifying for long :D
---
I will not allow people like you in my groups. Ret paladins are welcome.
---
I was a healer in vanilla and this thread has pretty much clinched my decision to main mage or rogue in classic 👍
---
Do warlocks wand a lot? I hate anything that doesn't use class spells
---
Our priest class leader was known to be pretty intimidating and bite ppls head off in raids if priests werent doing their jobs.
---
Lots of ppl were afraid to ask him questions during raids (which is probably the worst thing to happen to ensure a smooth raid)
---
I remember we got a new priest in and even though the person knew the class it was clear he hadnt performed in raids before, i helped him learn the ropes, where to stand in certain fights, when to pop stuff or regen etc. it was some great times in raids seing this person stumble through MC but becoming the boss in BWL and especially being one of the priests that helped us finally down Nef.
---
Forming my own so we don’t get noobs, won’t be a problem.
---
Fel Seed?! The ultimate antagonist!
---
Read Worth The Candle. If you like quirky, meta game-fiction.
---
It looks like a flexing bird statue to me.
---
It is likely true. Retail is a dog shit version. Many people like my self who played in 2004 dropped our subs years ago.
---
I was resto Druid in vanilla but will probably go priest this time around just for something slightly different
---
For 5 man dungeons with basic pre raid gear a Retribution paladin will do roundabout as much damage as MS warrior. He will have to drink as much as a mage and his AOE is worse then warrior but he will bring another blessing/aura to the group.
---
I can understand if you don't want the loot competition and yes Retribution paladins won't be as useful in Naxx and AQ40 without an absurd amount of consumables but for 5 mans and the entire 20man + MC/BWL content they are fully viable if not optimal.
---
shit healer.  Chain heal isn't efficient if it doesn't jump.  Usually the MT is either too far away from everyone else that's taking dmg, or the only one taking dmg.  
---
rshaman healing isn't just herp derp chain healz.
---
&gt; your just bad
---
Keywords spotted, can safely ignore this person, friends.
---
When I was playing ZG leg enchants were the norm. Now they won't be available as soon as you finish ZG.
---
No he won’t, I know this for a fact I’ve seen it many times.
---
It’s a waste of good loot and I’ll attract better players by saying I won’t allow retri, win/win
---
Pretty sure warrior outperforms priest in a group setting when it comes to lvling
---
I do join them, but even if I'm in a 5 it's still competing against 10 others for a 5 or 10 minute named spawn lol

---
The "intent" part of the definition of what an exploit is, is key.  
---
Raid bosses at appropriate level are/were/will never be intentionably soloable.   
---
Arguments can be made that something like King Gordok is intentionably soloable. There is zer0 chance that the employees/playtesters took a look at the encounter, stats and layout of the combat area without anyone wondering whether, or mentioning that a good hunter probably would be able to solo it.  
---
Kazzak being reckbombed to death was unintentional - the talent was designed to give you extra swings when someone/thing crit you, and you'd smack right back with righteous vengeance, not for you to be continuously stabbed for 3 hours by a rogue until you built up 1000+ charges.  
---
The military wing of Naxx being soloed by a mage spellstealing boneshield off deathknights and getting his spell power increased astronomically by a talent designed to function with fire/frost ward, mana shield, ice barrier and the odd power word: shield, is not intentional. 
---
Rampage in 2.0 having it's technical limitation (max stack of 5) overcome by zoning, bypassing the stacking limit and subsequently stacking it until bosses could be 1-shot was also unintentional.  
---
I ranked these raid boss killing exploits in severity, but they are ALL exploits nonetheless. Clever use of game mechanics or not.   
---
Intent is key.
---
Please have a look there:

You absolutely need Furor in order to get 10 rage when entering bear [(proof i just recorded on beta)](https://youtu.be/IyzbDHXQ-4c)
---
Of course if you prefer bear, you can go bear, all I've been saying is that for all factors (that I'm aware of) that contributes to leveling speed, cat wins out.

It's DM not VC.

They just did this in bfa
---
**Server: EU**
---
**Guild: &lt;Hubris&gt;** 
---
**Faction: Horde**
---
**Realm: TBD PvP**
---
**Loot: Council / List**
---
**Raid Days: Mondays and Thursdays.**
---
**Raid Time: 19:00 - 23:00 (server time)**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Expectations:**
---
We expect our members to be somewhat competitive. One should always bring consumables, world buffs and a good mood to raids. It’s not mandatory participating and ranking in PvP, but we highly encourage it. 
---
**About Hubris:**
---
Everyone has their own definition of fun. Our definition is being a part of a tight-knitted community with social and good-humored individuals; who always strive to be the best but never forgets to have some fun while at it. 
---
We are looking for like-minded players who share these values. Because there’s no point spending time collecting world buffs for an MC speedrun if not everyone is on board.
---
We are mostly made up of Norwegians and Swedes who came to play together on private servers. We are a light-hearted bunch who have our fun min-maxing the game and testing the limits of WoW’s mechanics and gameplay.
---
Most Hubris members played retail vanilla way back; where most of us are now pushing past 30. With age comes responsibilities in the shape of families and careers. So as much as we want to spend our days in our underwear, farming dungeons and raids, we can’t. That’s why it’s important for us to find players in a similar state of life and mind. Individuals who still want to min-max, without wasting any of our precious little time. 
---
We want to build a guild where we can enjoy some good banter on discord, while simultaneously being a force to be reckoned with in-game. We will have our cake and eat it too!
---
**PvE:**
---
Previous experience in PvE include:
---
* Clearing MC in mostly greens on the second lockout
---
* [Killing Hakkar in mere seconds with 50k+ ignite stacks](https://youtu.be/11M--EYik_s?t=2849), ~~getting half the guild banned~~ 
---
* Clearing Naxx, both retail and private server
---
We will probably not go for any world firsts as it would take up too much time. But we do think that aiming for server or faction first is still feasible. During progression, we might add Wednesday as an extra raid day.
---
A high emphasis is put on improving boss tactics, theorycrafting and finding the optimal raid setup. When content is on farm our clear times are estimated to be:
---
* Below 30 mins MC
---
* Below 60 mins BWL
---
* Below 30 mins ZG
---
* Below 70 mins AQ40
---
To keep raiding from getting stale we usually try to spice it up with some speedruns. This is a great way to keep content exciting and fun while waiting for the next patch update.
---
**World bosses:**
---
One of the most exhilarating and rewarding aspects of vanilla is by far: Contesting World Bosses. Ginormous PvP battles, mixed with great boss fights and top-notch loot and gear.
---
The GM of Hubris was one of the organizers and a founding leader of the world boss alliance at certain private servers. Where we at one point in time had a monopoly on all the world bosses and their loot for several consecutive months.
---
There is a great competition killing the world bosses, and it’s hard to act alone as a guild. This is why we will also make strategic alliances with other guilds for a higher chance of defeating our good friends:
---
* The Demon in the Taint(ed Scar)
---
* The Four Haters Of Sleep
---
* Azur[\[Typhoon\]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18542/typhoon)
---
**PvP:**
---
More than half of our members aim to achieve rank 10 or higher. Two special nutcases, who more than likely are complete masochist, will also torture themselves by going for rank 14. Many more will go for R12 &amp; R13. 
---
We plan on becoming the strongest horde premade on the server/battlegroup, and by doing that control the brackets of the server. We do believe this is highly achievable based on our previous PvP experience and skill, and the best gear from PvE content.
---
**Additional Information:**
---
Vanilla is finally back, and we’re hardly able to keep it in our pants. We hopefully piqued your interest in some way and hope to see you join the ranks of Hubris. 
---
**All exceptional players are considered.** 
---
You don’t need to be a hardcore player to be a vital part of our guild however. Come join us as a regular (social) member, with all the benefits of being in a great guild, without any of the pressure! We will run weekly soci-alt raids, that will consistently clear all raids (progressing through phases).
---
**Thank you for reading. We’re looking forward to hearing from you.**

---
Layering should remove any issues with login queues. *should*.
---
Do you get an email or have to log into blizzard to find out? I haven't played in years.
---
Thinking about it, probably shaman and paladin.
---
If you play alliance I think we just became best friends :)
---
If you play horde...the god of death once said...
---
*YOU WILL DIE*
---
lol
---
Well obviously if you're having problems with the content buffs is definitely helpful but we're talking about buffing the shit out of the raid to clear a raid a bit faster than you normally would've.
---
If moonkins have 3% spellcrit for their party, you can make It at least so that you want a moonkin to buff your mages, but you never would want more 2 in your raid.
---
What you are referring to is the % modifiers. A lvl 60 item with 2% crit chance is a lot lowered on lvl 70.
---
The int to crit, agi to crit, dodge etc. ratios were always level related.
---
8.2 will matter for BFA players, as it's most likely the or at least one of the biggest X.2 patch Blizzard ever released. I wonder what you're smoking to believe 8.2 won't last more than a day when millions are still playing 8.1.5 with but a new race and a new raid.
---
I doubt Blizzard expect classic fans to even care about retail for a few months at the very least, but 9.0 should be an opportunity for them as it seems they plan a level squish and a leveling rework for the next expansion.
---
Classic will be around as long as Blizzard is a thing, they intend it to be some kind of museum if things go wrong and no one plays it anymore.
---
I have been playing alliance forever, and In BGs everyone was the third head on my team. Well, my guild stopped raiding due to irl issues so I switched to Horde (to join another guild). I’ve done a good amount of BGs so far and I’ve noticed no difference lol. Guess it just depends when you Q, idk
---
Not really, there won't be a huge number of people pushing for it, even though I agree with you and I want to see it in the game. All you can do is post on the classic wow beta forum about it and see if others raise some noise as well.
---
man you're making me even more hyped...
---
2 months is so long.
---
¿?????????
---
So what does calling people a "poop sock" actually mean then?
---
 While yes Overwatch by that definition is an RPG, its still not classed as one, mainly for the reasons the other guy stated that there is no persistence. But, at the end of the day RPG qualifies to what ever you want. It is pointless to argue what it really means because the definition is more personal than technical.
---
It's already like this. I see maybe 10 people around Zul Dazar and borealis when I log in on weekends.
---
I am not certain. The thing is, you can get past the crunch of herbalism completely in the starting zone. I have not ever, in testing, found too much silverleaf, given how easily you can go through it by giving potions away. 
---
If they layer so that 40 people are in elwynn, I can see herbalism being fine. If they layer so that 400 people are in elwynn? forget it. 
---
But I am certainly going to try pretty hard to make herbalism work. and given how you can pretty much get to rank 3 healing potions without leaving the starting zone, I think it might be pretty practical.
---
You're conflating the space, it's a bit wider than you're trying to make it out to be.
---
I said, "a skill level that could be classified as average" (end result), I did not say "talent" (innate ability). Talent is not why tryhards are average. 
---
Generally, for a given activity, people can separate into two groups:
---
- the committed group, which wants to be the best, and assesses what sacrifices must be made and what other activities they'll miss out on to accomplish this. These people *do* work very hard, but they are *not* tryhards, because they are *committed*
---
- the normal group, where there are varying skill levels of skill, but, importantly, is the understanding that you will never be the best because you have chosen not to put in the time
---
A tryhard is someone who is in the second group, i.e., have not chosen to commit, but either doesn't realize it or pretends to not realize it, and acts like they are in the first group.
---
No shards sry
---
HS, SS and summon
---
They're permanent until used.
---
Maybe in the US yeah because they can play it mid day/late afternoon but us in EU have midnight launch times, feels bad.
---
In raids the meme factor is equal, but in pvp non healing shaman is actually good.
---
Classic+ would be on separate servers if done right, allowing you to copy over on launch 
---
So they could do balance changes to make more classes viable in pve, if they are adding content (gear) they might need to anyway
---
Could you not argue that the time it takes alone to grind for an old tier set in old raids, weeks on end, is something of an indicator to someones investment in the game?
---
Granted, its not same as actually raiding something like BWL at 60 on a regular basis (hence the absence of skill) but you can't deny it takes some doing to hit a full set of, say, full judgement T2 for a paladin?
---
10/10 Top comment
---
Similar - I was rogue, paladin and finished vanilla with warlock.
---
I'm trying to choose between mage, warrior or priest.
---
I won't go what I played then because I want a new experience with classic :)
---
FOR THE HORDE!!! YOUR BODY AND SOUL WILL PERISH IN THE WAKE OF MY slow and steady RISING... 
---
(I'm generally the peaceful kind of Tauren)
---
I'm not fond of prunes, can mine be apple juice instead?
---
Heh, weed
---
I always wanted hamburger for dinner. ;)
---
:O
---
I guess you didn't know of a popular addon in your beloved classic called "outfitter"
---
You're going to love seeing all that unique gear when runs are going to be sold like hotcakes very early on.
---
Ohh boy there will be phasing come launch, maybe not in beta because not everyone is a streamer or a friend of one.
---
Killing lava spiders for hours just to feed your shitty tank healthstones after every pull. Good times.
---
Stormrage US, and they raided 4 nights a week. I joined them in late BC so I didn't get to raid with them during Vanilla, but they kept all their old forum posts in the strategy section and I got to read how they downed all the old bosses back in the day.
---
Getting a kinda "Borderlands" from these, cool style!
---
Do hunters scale the same with attack power?
---
lol, spotted the "Priestitute" of the server
---
if you're a mail user, there's a quest in desolace from the goblin in the hut near the kodo graveyard that give extremely excellent mail shoulders. They'll take you to 38 where there's an upgrade in SM Armory.
---
Throw him off a cliff and whisper 'Garrosh remembers..'
---
Still got Discipline of Land/Hand to level, as well as other combat jobs.
---
Plus I got myself a mansion so got that shit to furnish.
---
There’s plenty of shit to do for a longer while 👌
---
&gt;if you're good, twist between them which reduces the total healing you do.
---
if u r an idiot...  Totem twisting consumes an asinine amount of mana.
---
MoP was the bomb class-design wise
---
Yeah I really don't need anything else than " **target nearest, cast melee spell, target last target**." But the things i try don't work. It never targets the last one again after i performed melee.
---
You’re not seriously suggesting that getting old gear sets take time or effort? You can even buy some for
---
Gold.
---
Yea, it's sad to see
---
You'd think the bandwagon would be full by now, what's even funnier is sharding and /or layering is going to be heavily abused and that's going to open up a new can of worms for the "classic 2.0" community
---
But hey, changes have already happened, imagine what else will happen once they get people hooked.
---
See my other response for clarity.
---
I haven't seen that many tryhards in the Vanilla servers I played, but I think that's because social matters and the primary characteristic of a tryhard is their toxicity and how unpleasant they are to be around.
---
Most of them I've seen in games like Dota 2 where people in the 2k bracket (read: not good at all) scream at you for not buying the right item or picking the non-meta hero.
---
Harsh, but fair
---
What UI version are you based on ?   
---
I'm a dev IRL and wanna take up wow addons development but without knowing which version we'll have, I just don't wanna start something just to have to refactor everything in a month.
---
Veri good minecraft tutorial me approve
---
Pog
---
While I agree with your sentiment I'd like to add that the Rogue's class description in the character creations screen describes them as using lesser mysticism AKA magic for their abilities. In other words, the stealth we see in WoW is implied to be magic.
---
It's from like patch 1.10. It shouldn't be in on launch, but obviously it might be anyway.
---
A thing to note about the warrior one is to get the trinket. You might not ever replace that thing.
---
Sash of Mercy is a random world drop. You mean Hide of the Wild.
---
I run about 1000 m+ Dungeons in first 2-3 months of Legion and trust me, there is nothing to enjoy while watching this misery. I would rather think that people enjoying watching it are casual players who never go themselves into mythic+ dungeons.
---
If it breaks the game no.
---
They've already said they will remove game breaking exploits like reckoning one shot bullshit and stuff like that.
---
World buffs are not an exploit, no matter how hard you try to justify it. If you could use a world buff to solo a raidboss it would be exploit, but you can't it simply makes people stronger.
---
World buffs were used in Vanilla just not to the extent they are on private servers. Nihilum for example did use world buffs for certain kills in Naxx. 
---
Is it a stupid gameplay mechanic to log out a day before the raid? Yes, absolutely. That doesn't mean a part of the game should be removed because some people find it inconvenient.
---
Tunic of Westfall
---
You’re probably right, my bad
---
The truth of the matter is that there's really not that many specs that are truly useless in PvE. The worst 2 are elemental and Boomkin, they have very little chance in raids, prot paladins also struggle quite a lot but aren't completely useless. Other than that all the other hybrid specs can be played and won't be a burden due to the extra utility (Ret, enhance and kitty DPS for example bring great utility and enough DPS where 99.9% of guilds and players won't notice the difference) as for some of the pure DPS classes there are some massively underwhelming specs that it would be nice to bring into line but class representation isnt as bad as people remember. The biggest issue was we were scrubs during Vanilla and didn't understand/know about some of the nuances we could employ like Wolfshead helm for Ferals for e.g. that have changed the amount of DPS a spec can do.
---
Yeah, probably gonna have to wait for more info on the layering aspect. But you're right, this is most certainly the way to go if at all possible!
---
&gt;11302
---
I think we'll have the BFA interface later. Keep an eye on that.
---
still, good job.
---
I played around with the spreadsheet over the weekend. Seems quite some stuff sims fairly weird. For some reason Obsidian edged blade does very well.
---
Have to say, this is very exciting, love the theorycrafting and the nice dps numbers. Though, I wouldn't say speed and sor is the only way to go. Yes, MCP rules supreme with SoR, but without MCP, the difference isn't that big. As I love the original ret paladin fantasy with the big slow twohander and SoC, I tinkered with an endgame hybrid build (not very different from the spelladin bis, just replaced bracers and gloves with strength ones, which have hit% and corrupted ashbringer as weapon). With SoC, it simmed about equal to the spelladin hungering cold build with SoR (5dps less) and was around 130dps behind MCP with SoR. So, it seems competitive SoC builds, at least discounting MCP, are possible.
---
Since the beta is at lvl 58 now, do we have some numbers regarding the scaling of lifestealing, shadow oil and pre-raid weapons like demonshear?
---
Come on dude, seriously. You know what I meant by that, don't be silly now. Obviously the purpose is to make money. But the sole purpose for their design philosophy is to make the game as authentic as possible - is that easier for you to understand?  
---
You can hate on me, and downvote me all that you want, but it doesn't change that what i'm saying is right and it certainly aren't going to change the fact that world buffs will be in the game as they were back then.
---
Yes, I will play the same class but I will slowly lvl an alt class I never played back in vanilla.
---
You can't do a paladin if you're horde on the same server
---
I typically stay in Darkshore until around 15 or 16 and then head to Westfall to get all the DM quests.  15 or 16 seems to be about the time Darkshore quests get awkward with level gaps / boatloads of time spent running all over the zone.  After I complete my Deadmines run(s), I usually head back to Darkshore to finish it off before heading into Ashenvale, or where I feel like going at that point.
---
Rogues are magic. Look up the vanilla rogue class description in the character creation screen. In case you hadn't noticed all these years, chalk that up to them being real sneaky.
---
The game has been out for 15 years, I'm pretty sure if someone is curious they can find out how strong each spec is in certain situations.
---
druid playstyle 1/5?  you crazy boi!
---
Doesn't have to be remove if it's only problematic for raid.
---
&gt; they are looking into adapting more legacy servers for those looking to play TBC and WOTLK
---
Do you have a link for where they said this? That's exciting!
---
A fair bit if you opt to level imp voidwalker / afflic where you simply dot, let your pet tank and then wand. Think it's the faster / more efficient of the leveling specs too but not required by any stretch.
---
I will main class I got the best and biggest overall experience playing (Rogue) and my alt is going to be Druid I played back with my ex and enjoyed shapeshifts and how it could be played differently fulfilling role of dps/healer/tank. In raids I will probably switch between dps and healing. If I will raid with my alt, I will join casual guild or raid with people from my main guild anyway.
---
Seconding this. + Don't clip you auto shot.
---
Hey don’t forget about the flask recipe as well, gotta sit on the 1k g recipe for months!!
---
Maybe you can meet Up in Loch modan, ton of nice Quest for around level 12
---
bad bot
---
All one or two druids in the raid will be BFFs
---
I would love to play dwarf female! I just can't justify looks over the 10% rep + 5 weaponskill human gives :(
---
I have never seen a druid healing build that includes it among the many various guides I've read. And I have not in my raiding time in vanilla experienced a healer pulling threat in raids.
---
I thought this myself, I think the BRD/UBRS/LBRS font is very similar to the Borderlands one.
---
Morladim is even scarier. Stitches is a sissy compared to him.
---
The reason I have fallen in love with the class is because it is open to so much creativity. There are about 100 ways you can open up a fight in pvp. 
---
You can use Feign Death to drink+eat+shadowmeld to easily reset a fight. Classes who lack AoE can’t stop you from regaining that mana and health. You can also feign death and gear swap to certain resist-gear+trinkets mid-fight if you meet a shadow priest for example.
---
Feign Death is such an intersting ability. It was probably intended mostly for PvE and some gimmicky fake-outs in PvP but ended up being the biggest ability for hunters, having multiple uses and revitilazing the class for me.
---
Hunters even have some aoe-farming-capability with owls’ screech ability that can aoe taunt while you stack explosive trap and ravager procs.
---
Great game design allows players to be creative, you could argue that these things are not intended by the developers but it is the depth and hidden tricks to each class that makes us fall in love with them.
---
Mages are the fury warriors of casters. Up their own ass because of ignite, touchy about debuffs and loothorny as fuck.
---
I swear to fucking God if I ever see a Neltharions Tear go to a mage over hard working warlocks again imma lose my shit
---
You mean EZ mode called Gearing Simulator? : o
---
Second kid on the way and I can feel your situation. That’s why I roll a healer this time so I can find a group whenever I want/can play. Raiding is gonna be tricky due the fact that I can only start to play after 8pm... and only 2 nights a week probably
---
Yeah I would play human if I played sword aswell.
---
Great post, thanks for sharing
---
Perhaps, I personally intend to level two 60s, raid-ready with maxed out professions, with possibly a 19 twink.
---
I don't think I am alone with this mindset and that won't be done with that lot quickly!
---
Wonder if dats real kenion lol
---
Also Opportunity talent gives you +20% Ambush damage and Initiative gives you 75% chance Ambush to give additional combo point. The mob you are targeting is pratically dead on your first strike. With Premeditation you can do some huge 5 point finishing moves with exactly 2 hits.
---
For PvP is even better..
---
if you are playing casually, as you said, then I'd take two gathering professions. There will be loads of folk looking for skill ups, happy to make gear if you supply the mats. Also, you dont really need much gear from crafting as you level. The quest rewards are fine. 
---
Skinning is good for vendoring stuff as you have to kill so many mobs. Easily covers the cost of your mount at 40. 
---
I'm planning on skinning / Mining as I level, then once 60, I might decide to change that to enchanting or engineering. Will see how my gold is once I reach 60.
---
You just found a group for scarlet after 1 hour and you are all heading to Southshore...
---
**\[EU-PvE\] &lt;Truefaith&gt; \[Alliance\] Filthy Casuals Warning!** 
---
**About Us:** \- We are reincarnation of vanilla WoW casual guild. Friendly and laid back, yet raiding capable group of nerds. Guild got to like half-way AQ40, which if you ask me is quite impressive for casuals, and that’s on Quel Thalas which was a realm added later, not at launch
---
We don’t focus on PvP tho certain individuals with questionable sanity and paladin toolkit (Sorry John) can teach you the ropes in all of the battlegrounds. We will not actively discourage PvP either (but seriously stop wasting time and come to MC ok?)
---
**What We Provide:** 
---
\- Hunter loot and Chuck Norris jokes
---
\- Knowhow … we were there, we did it, we had amazing time so we wanna do it again
---
\- Dire Maul sightseeing tours with a guide (Im so salty with will not be there at launch)
---
\- Friendly environment of adult people, we will all jump into the dungeon to help you with your one dumb quest and we don’t care if griding levels is more time efficient
---
\- Pooling resources, we work together to get our crafters up to speed. Especially if you get some of them juicy patterns from the goblin in Dire Maul (Yes I love the place!), get people Onyxia cloaks and resistance gear…
---
**What Are We looking For:** 
---
\- Being casual guild makes this easy, we welcome everyone with good attitude, bad language is perfectly fine as long as it’s a joke. Insulting guildies is a no-no, but we like a good drama, just keep it civil
---
\- Open mind, WoW classic is very different from retail and if you were not there, you will just have to trust us. If anyone says something about class/spec not being viable we will mock him. If you didn’t expect group healed by druid and tanked by fury warrior with hunter jumper cables being only rez, to run DM north tribute runs, you are in for a surprise friend (we know there are spec that have issues, but we are ready to advise and if you hard bent on playing one we will help you find your place). You will also see paladins in cloth healing in MC, its actually really funny (Sorry John)

[https://discord.gg/vXzHTpt](https://discord.gg/vXzHTpt)
---
Througout Vanilla, what I considered my main changed quite a few times.
---
Warlock, Warrior, Hunter, Druid, Mage and another Warrior.
---
Most time was probably spent on the Druid.
---
What makes druid the most compelling choice this time again, is the same as back then. I have 3 completely different playstyles depending on what I want to do:
---
Questing in the world as a Cat.
---
Tanking dungeons as a Bear.
---
Healing dungeons as an Elf.
---
Funnily enough my second consideration is Mage. For the exact opposite reason: The simplicity of doing everything in the same gear and being really good at the one thing I can do, which is the one thing the druid is most lacking in.
---
I think that by playing Druid and Mage a bit simultaneously I have always something that fits my mood.
---
I played as a healer from Vanilla to Legion, not going to change that since its what I like to do!
---
That being said, I have "main-ed" 3 healers, Holy Priest from Classic to BC, Resto Shaman from Wrath to Mists of Pandaria and Paladin from WoD to Legion. I had a Mistweaver Monk as an alt during MoP since it was the 1st time they introduced a new healer class and pretty much since TBC my "main alt" if you can call it that was a Resto Druid, that never made the jump to become my main in any expansion, can't really say why, it just never happened.
---
Regarding my Classic main, well not going to play Priest since I already had that experience...Shaman is impossible since I am rolling Alliance. That leaves my Paladin and Druid...it will most likely be Paladin eventho I feel that I own it to Druid to be my main, but Druids in classic are kinda "odd"...they are great in everything in general but are "meh" regarding specifics if that makes sense, the perfect of example of Jack of all trades, master of one!
---
Its still up in the air but it will most likely be Paladin.
---
Wow if I'm rich I'm gonna so do this haha
---
One of the greatest things about Classic is that there are a lot less restrictions on what you can do in the game.
---
Making something not usable in a raid goes against that.
---
I don't really care about how world buffs change the meta but the philosphy of "You can use everything, everywhere" is what's important.
---
If we ban world buffs in raids, next thing people ask for engineering items to be banned in raids because if you want to be top tier you are forced to be an engineer. Even more so in PvP.
---
Then lazy people will ask for consumables to be banned from battlegrounds because they don't want to grind consumes to be able to play BGs and slowly we get back to retail WoW.
---
They won't start from scratch with 15-20 year old graphics. Also people like Ion are way too proud to admit that their current WoW is terrible.
---
Transmog is the worst, wight there with the other retail 'features' that just suck.
---
It Will be glorious!
---
I'm fairly sure they do disappear. At least they did on the first private server I played on, I think it's I'd you're logged out for more than 24h. 
---
I usually brought around 20 ish shards to a raid, and tried draining a few on trash pulls :)
---
1.5g? Too unreal for me.
---
This guy is a Paladin main, I just know it.
---
&gt; Is it worth the subscription cost
---
You can literally play 8 hours a day for at least a year and not get bored for those 15 bucks.
---
&gt; Why would you personally recommend Classic to someone
---
Sense of accomplishment in everything you can do in-game.
---
I play Elemental Shaman only for 15 years. But I also want to play in a serieus raid eviorment. Resto is no option so I decided on Mage.
---
Mage has always been my second choise + they have an build called "Elemental Mage".
---
Maybe, or I'm just generally stupid. :)
---
Loot is personal in retail no?

**About**: A Group of long time WoW players with raiding experience in all expansions seeking dedicated raiders and PvPers for Classic WoW. Our core group of players have played at the highest levels of both PvE and PvP with achievements like 2700 rating in Arena and raiding in top 100 world ranked guilds. TOXIC aims to be one of the top guilds on the server clearing all raid content through each stage whilst creating a fun atmosphere in the process.
---
**What we are looking for**: For the initial launch and levelling stage we welcome anyone regardless of experience as long as you uphold the guilds core principles and values; once content is being progressed our recruitment requirements will change. Since we are a Semi-hardcore guild, we don’t expect everyone to minimax every aspect of their game but we do expect a proactive approach from our members and willingness to learn and keep excelling in their role.
---
For those that want to participate in PVE content, we are looking for committed players that are able to raid 3 days a week. We don’t require any private server or past experience, but we do require that you will attempt in obtaining most of your pre raid BIS and a willingness to research and learn your class as well as the tactics to each boss fight.
---
Our officers also place a strong emphasis on PVP since it provides BIS pieces, therefore we are also looking for dedicated members interested in participating in PVP.
---
**What we offer**:
---
* A close-knit group of experienced players to bring stability and success
---
* Great banter and atmosphere while raiding or PvPing
---
* Huge community that caters for all playstyles
---
* All raid content cleared before next raid comes out - Well organised and professionally ran PvP events and premades

We had a healing channel, where we played games like "how low can you go" during raids. :D Who ever casted the heal that landed 1st, lost  (1G cost) :D And if we wiped, we all lost (1g cost per healer) and we used the price money to give the tanks some repair money :D We only did it like once or twice per raid though :D
---
&gt; But, at the end of the day RPG qualifies to what ever you want. It is pointless to argue what it really means because the definition is more personal than technical.
---
I can't argue with that. But that means the word RPG is meaningless, literaly, since it doesn't convey any meaning.
---
By the way, there's some persistence in Overwatch : the skins, the successes, the ratings. Is it really different than account-wide rewards in WoW ? (keep in mind that one character in WoW can gain a new mount because of what another character did... it doesn't fit with **my** definition of RPG)
---
:&lt; My comment was dedicated to all retri/prot/enh/feral/melee hunts, i was not talking about constantly switching specs. You could try something if that don't work it's always plan B choosing best spec for class.  
---
One thing i could say that end game quest rewards are once. For example druid could get armor trinket if they don't get it they screw up and never will be able to play tank. If they would try it once.
---
Can trade it with anyone who was there when you got it.
---
Play Mage.
---
I'll be a Warrior even though they're the most popular. Just gotta go with what matches your personality.
---
Hunter, why you multishot when the mage never told you that he will polymorph, didn't mark the polymorph and hadn't done that the entire dungeon up to now.... Look at what you did you undid the sheep.
---
Sucks but there aren't many people playing - so it sounds like you just got a bunch of douchers.
---
Soon 8.2 will be out, I'll unlock flying and try and squeeze another token or two for a 2nd account, then uninstall retail for good :)
---
Mained a Rogue in Vanilla. (Hardcore raiding up to Naxx when I quit)
---
Might play a Druid: Fun leveling experience as I'll be a casual player. Endgame seems okay as a Druid. (Resto with tank ambitions)
---
Might play a Priest: Steady levelers and just utility bots. Everything a Rogue is not.
---
Might play a Rogue: Class fantasy still appeals most to me. Will be a pain in the ass to level / find dungeon groups / gear up probably tho.
---
Maybe that grass is greener because you're not over there fucking it up.

 **Southwind Breeze** &lt;[southwindbreeze.co.uk](https://southwindbreeze.co.uk/)\&gt;
---
We want to build a community that can enjoy the game without the constraints of a traditional guild. By keeping the quality of player high we hope to make a home for all those who still want to experience all of classic on a real life timetable.  
---
**About**
---
SWB is a UK based Classic Alliance guild, focusing on a casual timetable with hardcore results. Currently we are a reliable core of 20, a majority of Liverpool &amp; Newcastle lads. We share the same methodology, hardcore results with a laidback, chilled, enjoyable atmosphere.  
---
**Quick basic facts, expanded upon on our website**
---
• 8pm First Pull, Ending 11pm. (UK time)
---
• 2 Nights a week
---
• No guild hierarchy.
---
• DKP, fair for everyone system.
---
• UK Core of very strong players which we hope to expand.
---
We are currently voting on which days. It is looking to be Wednesday&amp;Thursday or Wednesday&amp;Monday, excluding Friday&amp;Saturday. On the fly additional content with spare days for those who need more.  
---
**LFM**
---
Seeking all classes at the moment, however the niche rolls are nearly full. Our website can provide great insight and expanded explanations behind the core decisions that have made us who we are, please check it out. You can apply though the website or get in touch with myself or Xido#1269
---
Any other guild leaders out there who are in a similar position to us please get in touch. If we shared the same ideology it could be a great opportunity to create a quality 40man experience.
---

---
These are actually dope as hell, gj bruh
---
I'm aware of that, just wondering what the case for not including it as an option would be. It has as much impact as improved shadows or anti aliasing on the gameplay
---
Priest, Mind controll is a very strong cc. And if you want the group to join a raiding guild, guilds are more likely to take 2 priests over 2 warriors.
---
In BFA yea :D
---
Mage in classic
---
Got it on friday and it is stiöl here but cant click the play button 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
What changed vetween now and wotlk that people say the game is shit now but was best then?
---
WotlK was like the beginning of the game going to shit with mass aoe dungeons, dungeon finder, easy and quick questing, class homogenization, gold inflation... 
---
Sure the story was great and so were the raids but other expansions had those as well (with all the hate WoD got people seemed to be pretty happy with the raids) so I'm left wondering what the hell it is that wrath lovers loved so much about the game that is now absent.
---
I wonder what kind of response you were looking for posting this on r/classicwow...
---
They've done *stat* squishes, never a *level* squish, similar in concept but not exactly the same thing.
---
Not clipping autoshots is the #1 difference dps-wise... by far.
---
yeah that's exactly what i am like as well, little one goes to bed around 7/8. I am a single dad so I could play most evenings. 
---
I think raiding is a possibility but deff not the aim for me.
---
What faction are you leaning towards? I am still not certain.
---
 **&lt;Semper Danica&gt; \[EU-PVP\] \[Alliance\] \[18+\]\[DK\]**
---
**Language:** Danish  
---
**Time zone:** CET  
---
**Guild type:** Semi-Hardcore PvE and PvP  
---
**Raid times:** 20:00-22:30 (subject to change) two times a week. The days will be decided by the raiders once we are at that point in the game.  
---
**Loot system:** TBD by the raidteam(s), either DKP or loot council based.  
---
**About us:**  
---
Semper Danica (SD) is a 100% pure danish speaking MMO guild. Our members are all 18+ and are expected to behave mature and respectful, but still with plenty of room to have fun.  
---
SD is a multi-mmo guild, which means we also offer activities in other mmo games. We were founded back in 2002 and have been active in several MMORPGS through out the years. We have always had a strong presence in WoW since vanilla and plan on keep this going forward. We are trying something new with Classic since we in this game will be going Alliance as opposed to our normal Horde tendencies.  
---
**What we offer:**
---
* Downing content in a timely manner.
---
* Laughs and good times, but in a respectful environment.
---
* A good mix of classes and specs, with room for some of the more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavor to the raid; a Feral druid with option to OT and provide crit buffs, a shadow priest that boosts shadow dmg and so on.
---
* Dungeon runs, whilst lvling and afterwards to gear for raids and acquire gold.
---
* Plans for organised Battle grounds. 
---
* Spreadsheets/lists with overview of guild professions and guildbank.
---
* Helpful and knowledgeable environment.
---
* Social activities in-game and RL where we have yearly Christmas and summer parties/get togethers and smaller stuff through out the year.
---
* Active in other games.  
---
**What we seek:**  
---
We are looking for players that are willing and motivated to participate in raids and the social aspects of the game. We don't just want people who can top the meters. Situational awareness, survivability and most importantly fitting in well with SD both during raids and outside of raids is of great importance to us.

**&lt;Imperium&gt; Recruiting, Semi-Hardcore PvE / PvP / wPvP Guild.** **Server Type: EU-Region PvP (tho if you are from NA thats totally fine, too!)** **Faction: For the Horde!**
---
**Who are we?** Here at **Imperium** we believe in **the journey and comradry** that vanilla offers. We share the long-time goal dream of thousands of players that wanted to make retail classic servers a reality! Since we all now have achieved that goal it is time to take the next step! **In our guild we want to encourage the social aspect of the game**, aswell as playing every bit of variety it has to offer. (PvE, PvP, wPvP, Grinding) Of course this doesn't mean that we want especially Grinding and Raiding to be a mind numbing auto-pilot experience. **We like to keep things fun and challenging!** Putting all the above mentioned things together we created Imperium with **a simple vision**: **We want to create a mature raiding and pvp community, we want to endure throughout the whole journey and we want to have the most fun possible while at it!**
---
**Who are we looking for?** We are looking for a variety of people, no matter the vanilla background you have, no matter the schedule you might have, we want you to be a part of our awesome community, to enhance your and our vanilla experience, together, no matter the time you will be able to spend in the game!
---
**What are our goals?** We want to clear every vanilla content and acquire all the awesome epic gear that is there. While we are at it we want to have as much **fun** as possible also doing wPvP and PvP so the Alliance will get to fear us! We want to create a strong bond between our members **making the journey an unique experience**!
---
**What do we expect from you?** We want to create **a mature guild environment**, meaning you should at least be 20 years or older. **You do not need to have played vanilla to qualify for joining us! :-)**  If you are new to the class you will be playing on retail classic that is totally fine. It would be awesome though if you are **willing to improve on your class**, this can of course be done in conjunction with your respected **class-leader, who will be able to guide you**.   **Participation** on our scheduled raids and if you so wish, PvP and especially wPvP activities.
---
**What will our Raid-Schedule be?** **Tuesdays &amp; Fridays: 20:30 - 00:00 CET/CEST.**
---

---
So the other 30 people just show up to gear up the council? Defuc kinda attitude is that. 
---
Plenty of DKP systems can be implemented to migitate the problems of inflation and other issues.
---
Other then the MT, the rest of the raid was always equal in my guild. Turnover never really was an issue, because... well... we where not assholes that took all the loot for the council :P
---
Each layer requires computer hardware to run. The cost doesn’t change from having 1 server with 10 layers to having 5 servers with 2 layers each. The hardware and bandwidth required for both those options is the same. It’s not like you can run 100 instances (or layers if you will) of WoW on your home pc because your pc probably doesn’t have the hardware to support it.
---
Thanks for letting me know the definition!
---
Not a personal attack on my part by the way: it's just something I've generally noticed from experience that people who use the word 'toxic' in that context can be uptight. There's no reason your guild can't do well if you can find like-minded people to join it.
---
This is on the nose.  Horde players certainly have a higher win rate.  But wins per hour, for example?  I bet it's more equal than we like to admit.
---
ive been listening to all of  esfandtv's classicast podcast on youtube and playing on a private server just to see what i want to lvl
---
Insta full HP heal, bubble, cleanse, Bop, freedom and the ability to almost 1 shot with reckoning, seems fair!!
---
I would like to see that as well. Never heard of that outside of wishful thinking from the respective fans.
---
It felt epic in scope. Also you would meet the same people as this was before CRB so you would build rivalries. Although H:A server ratio pretty much ruined it.
---
Yeah, same as rogue vanish trinket swaps. Now I wonder: could you do the same with other classes using invisibility potion, does it break combat?
---
Every system has issues, loot council is no exception.
---
int does not scale with shatter crit at all. You don't know what scaling means
---
It suggests I was quite excited about the condition of the box, and that was a main purpose of the post. It wasn't. 
---
So yes, it does.
---
Yeah the PvP is what I'm hoping for. Raiding is just being included as a means to acquire gear. End goal is gonna be WPvP and BG's
---
Blizzard's art team is always on point. No matter how dull the game gets it's always beautiful.
---
This wouldn't be as game breaking as the auto download add-ons and could be built into the game code so it does it itself so it's possible. The auto downrank add-ons made raid healing a bore and totally removed any skill required for healing.
---
of all the AV streams ive seen this weekend it was at least 80% ppl playing mage.
---
retail bad classic good
---
&gt; Sadly the Raidlead introduced Min-Bids somewhat quickly.
---
Wonder why that happened.
---
Hyyyyype!

 Can’t wait till retail when all this mofu afk boys disappear.., like every bg is a half bot only run in circles and hit sometimes for not getting kicked cause afk debuff#fuck private
---
These look like Bar signs.
---
Get rank 10 and exalted with all the pvp reps. I want every piece of my gear to be from pvp even if it isnt BIS. Gonna see how well I can do with limited gear
---
I wont argue that made healing easier... but it was part of vanilla nevertheless. Those who playing healers back then, remember the game that way.. now they will have to play almost a "new" class. 
---
I am not playing healer anyway, just sayin :P
---
One hot crispy critter then ;)
---
I heard that it’s using the more updated game client and not the one from 2006 though...wouldn’t that mean that it needs BfA tier system reqs
---
I feel like ‘lower’ should be underneath Blackrock Spire.
---
It wasn't a part of all of vanilla, it was broken by blizz during Vanilla
---
Well considering how we’re going to be a few weeks into a new raid tier, people are gonna keep playing retail even if it is just to get cutting edge in the new raid. I know that for a fact I’m going to try and getting cutting edge queen azshara when it comes out.
---
Is retail in a bad spot? Fuck yes it is. Am I hyped as shit for classic? Hell yes I am and the 30 other gangsters in my guild are as well. Are we going to quit retail altogether? No, because we still love WoW and want to see wow get better than the current state that it is in right now.

Horde Locks more in demand than Shaman? Paladin HPS lower than Priests.
---
Your approach is exactly what I did a couple years ago when a famous pserver launches and it led me to Shaman tbh.
---
grinding old gear is literally the easiest thing in the world and its so fucking stupid that it's like that
---
Onyxia's Lair would deffo be a strip club.
---
3rd most upvoted post on /r/classicwow GG
---
Thanks for asking ! For me two things:
---
1) FIrst I will start with a drood (because of nostalgia of my main back then).  
---
2) Then I will level a rogue, doing a lot of pvp. Because of the gameplay is really interactive, with lot of cooldowns.
---
&gt;you just want them for the cc factor.
---
Is that very useful for raiding? I won;t be doing pvp but like the idea of engineering
---
You realize people normally use "tryhard" as a pejorative, right?
---
NA-PVP-Alliance-Late Night
---
My brother and I are looking for a late night raiding guild. Preferably raid times at 10pm CST or later. Our classes are undecided but would prefer to play alliance. Not looking to be super hardcore, but looking to progress. Message me!
---
Same, if I take any time off it'll be week after.
---
You fail to realize that BFA is widely regarded as the second worst expansion blizz has ever released. Players came back to check it out, then left after they realized how awful it was. The damage is done, they’re not coming back for 8.2. Raiders will raid a few times. Mount collectors will collect a few new shiny mounts. The majority of WoW fans will not give a shit about this patch. 
---
Also if they really add in another furry race to the game like people are speculating I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what’s wrong with the retail WoW devs. It’ll make the game that much worse.
---
AP is still great for hunters, they just prefer agility in a way: 1agi &gt;2ap, but 20ap&gt;8agi, something like that.
---
sure, but make no mistake, i will talk to them about a counter offer, and with streamer benifits they would top you easy.
---
and you only have 3-4 hours a day for the game next to your school/homework/work/wife/etc
---
they have 10hours aday.... guess who eventualy be on the recieving end of the stick and will feel it way more....
---
thats right YOU.
---
now grow the F up , streamers dont even make up 1% of the beta, let alone a real server
---
Props for the effort, but these values are wack man.
---
If you're a good player in a shit guild, you're a superstar to the people in that guild. If you're a good player in a good guild, then you're a superstar to everyone in every guild below you.
---
I've always liked it too but it's got no nodes for mining and not much in the way of herbs either. You'll not be able to make much progress (none in regards to mining) until you get to Darkshore and everyone ends up making to run to the Human area anyway so it does make sense for a lot of people to just go there early.
---
I was the gnome rogue kill stealing anything in sight
---
Wait, so in classic we're getting 16 debuff limit?
---
But that is not what this is - it is just a crappy karmagrab. If you want to discuss the state of BfA you could go to... You know... r/wow.
---
It's ironic that everyone here shits on BfA, yet you can't scroll through the frontpage without going past several post about BfA. Just because it is the same franchise does not mean it is relevant content - this sub is about WoW Classic.
---
10/10 meme, he even looks like esfand.
---
The case? They're replicating the gameplay experience to resemble 1.12 as closely as they reasonably can.  
---
Not a lot of things have large impacts, but they add up.  
---
Conversely, since we asked for for vanilla as-it-was-then, what's the case for adding it in? The burden of reasoning should be for including it when it wasn't included in 1.12 - even if it just seems like an innocent and insignificant change.
---
and thats why me my friends guildies and other will save heclars?!?!?! rod till 60 so when we invade, we have slave npc's!!!!!!
---
Gathering professions scales with inflation, so if you can’t solo farm dire maul, just get gathering professions. 
---
Solo farming instances has never been considered as an exploit by blizzard, but they made it so that you can only do 5 resets each hour to limit the farming.
---
This is the same for priests and druids, don't know about paladins.
---
First aid has saved my life countless times while leveling. Probably THE most useful profession.
---
I guess my meaning was, DPS shouldn’t expect a health stone.
---
You have my hammer, brother.
---
Finally one on a day that I don't work ♥
---
Loot Council's only problem is abuse by shit guilds. But does anyone want to be in a shit guild? It's fucking Stockholm, just leave, you're not forced to raid with assholes.
---
Nice subtle starship troopers reference
---
its my screen shot of the day dude
---
judging the retail experience based on dungeon finder levelling lmao
---
Paladin, you will be able to add extra armor on the warrior, a paladin has lower heals but better mana stability and later you gain a buff to lower threat from dps players who might join to do dungeons with you thus granting stability to threat from the tank.
---
Not being invited to groups that would take a ret paladin sounds like a good thing tbh
---
I actually tried this, it looked cool but read more like 'Blackrock Spire Lower' which sounded odd to me.
---
Why would you gear players to get poached by other guilds? You gear the players you know are dedicated. You gear your friends. You gear the core of your guild, which is not exclusively officers.
---
You assume I'm the asshole, but I'm the one advocating for the best interest of the guild. Keep the loot where it counts, make sure you have your core geared before you gear newer players. You risk massive losses giving high priotiy on loot to players who havent proven themselves as a dedicated member of the guild.
---
But you couldn't shame people on a mass scale, if I recall that was a moveable offence on the forums for example.
---
Can't moderate streamers and their fans as easily
---
They have to be careful with balancing to not entirely botch another aspect of the game. Like PvP fixes breaking how boss mechanics can be avoided or the other way around.        
---
Vanilla, despite flaws, worked. So going with that makes sense to me.  
---
Blizzard already said, they will look into keeping classic fresh beyond Vanillas content. Wether that means fresh content and new balance eventually, after the Vanilla timeline played out, or an upgrade to TBC remains to be seen.        
---
But for now i think the majority wants classic to be as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
Except for NE they cannot accept this horrific deforestation going on. Ashenvale Must prevail in the face of atrocious nature-disregarding individuals. NE the real tree hugging hippies.
---
Yeah these are my personal preferences, i kept them in as an example. I’m thinking about providing an empty version but I feel that wouldn’t be as self-explanatory.
---
I just use a combination of WASD+QE with shift, ctrl and alt, but then again, I got huge hands. I can comfortably use the '7' while using WASD.
---
I’m just tired of playing shitty games. Sigh.
---
Should be next to the Engineering trainer in OG, a little hut in the Valley of Strength IIRC. 
---
Not sure about level requirement though, perhaps 28-29?
---
I don’t really why I am so hyped for classic. I am already playing on pservers to figure out what class I want to play. It’s the same game  mostly but somehow starting on a fresh official server is really exciting.
---
Well, let me put it like that:
---
When WoW first came out, I didn't play anything else up until about 2009.
---
The game slowly deteriorated with each new add-on by slowly giving up on what it was that made the original so much fun.
---
I'm not saying that everything that came after classic was bad.
---
But overall it turned more and more into a fast paced action-game to obtain some instant-gratification from instead of a consistent world to get lost in.
---
I mean nowadays you click on a button to get teleported somewhere that feels completely unrelated to what you are currently doing, you get grouped with others you've never seen before and likely will never see again to do something in order to get some reward and after that you are teleported back to where you were before.
---
Stuff like that completely ruins the immersion of being in another world!
---
Hold on... you’re saying a druid has less tools to back out of a bad pull than a warrior?  Is this specific to dungeon tanking?  Clearly druids are vastly superior in this regard for open world, solo / leveling content...
---
I thought cat’s extra damage was equal to, if not better than the extra damage from furious howl, especially if it doesn’t hit all 5 people in your group, so I thought you should just bring a cat instead.
---
BfA BAD.
---
not a fan, too cartoony. reminds me of all those 'cal arts' shows on cartoon network
---
The first thing that depresses me in modern whenever I come back is complete lack of social interaction and insignificance of decisions (what decisions?).
---
Even once you get to harder content the general "fuck you, got mine" attitude prevails.
---
If they were less mainstream it would be because they were weaker and less appealing then you probably wouldn't want to main them =P
---
Don't they share sub times?
---
Thanks for your in-depth reply! I honestly wasn’t expecting a specific answer so I appreciate it! I’ve been playing a tank on retail wow and am looking to tank in classic :)
---
Okay but why would forcing yourself to play the absolute mess retail is make the game better? If anything quitting and giving feedback to blizzard when you fill out the unsub survey would have a bigger impact on making the game better imo
---
Continuing to play tells blizz that you think the game is fine and you’re giving them money on top of it
---
Blasphemous
---
Why?
---
They have an old school horror film poster vibe, and I dig it
---
Not to sound like a douche, but I'm honestly not sure what the point of this post is.
---
If you want to level in a suboptimal way because you find that more enjoy you're entitled to do so and I would even encourage you to do so, but we're really not able to provide any feedback or advice (or whatever you're looking for, as I said I'm not sure what the point is), when you're valuing subjective things quantifiable and objective things.
---
Classic is simply the better game and more of an RPG and MMO.
---
I feel like retail is actually much harder to get into because the whole progression path is very counterintuitive.
---
Now this is quality content
---
The difference is that in current WoW it's almost impossible to die during the first levels and you don't have to pay attention at all, because the game directly points you where to go and what to press. 
---
The starter edition is a horrible showcase of what the game is about and I had multiple friends uninstall it after 2 hours, because it's completely braindead.
---
Early levels in vanilla aren't complex, but at least you need some spatial awareness and that makes a world of difference when it comes to actually caring about the game.

Indeed. I have really fond memories of WotLK, but that may have been largely due to it having the best story in my opinion. It was also WoW’s peak in popularity. I’d say my best memories are of Wintergrasp and dungeons prior to the release of the dungeon finder. Naxx was a remarkably good time, too.
---
But it’s hard to forget how pissed off the whole world was over the recycling of Naxx. There was also gearscore cancer. People stopped talking to each other as much because of dungeon finder. Group quests became mostly a thing of the past. WotLK truly was the beginning of everything being streamlined for a single player experience. Cata was just another nail in the coffin. I stuck around for WotLK, but I don’t think I lasted more than 2 weeks into Cata. I haven’t truly played retail since. Gave Legion a try and it was just unrecognizable.

Sincerely Flymanxoxo2001 &amp; i fartblood &amp; attackerguy ...
---
I'm a casual player and vanilla is fine... Vanilla was designed for casual players...
---
And alliance always loses because we try to fight cockily next yo your gy or in the middle of the BG or in the middle of the road between lumber mill and blacksmith. Hence not enough people to take the objective. Damn rogues always camping their flags and what not.
---
And iirc your shitty tank will have a nice repair bill (plate vs cloth) after each raid.  Each class have their annoyances.
---
Not a lot of people bother running outfitter, especially outside RP realms. Moreover, outfitter isn't remotely as bad as people will still be using their actual gear outside cities.
---
I want to have top DPS without having to invest time into the game is the same argument retailers use for gear.
---
I want to have the best gear but not invest time into the game.
---
It's a completely meaningless arguement anyway since world buffs will stay no matter how much people cry.
---

This guide should answer you question.
---
shaman bc totems
---
At least for a month or so.
---
I’m not here for any other part of this discussion, but...
---
“Karmagrab”
---
Way too many people dismiss posts as karma whoring as if they forgot that karma is completely useless and serves no function. Pretty confident most people aren’t actually posting just for the sake of karma.
---
Not many guilds will consider using a shadow priest until ZG comes out, though, and then usually only one.
---
Can you clarify what your specific concern is?
---
HotW NS was the way to go in Vanilla WoW for any Feral wanting to balance PvE with PvP without pouring money into resetting the talent tree every 4 hours.
---
No where on my pve server heheh
---
prot warry as flag carrier in warsong.
---
good luck getting that flag back haha
---
What does the sad excuse of a server that you play on have to do with WoW Retail or Classic?
---
The point of the post a discussion of what would be more beneficial to go after level 42 where my build stops. Or offer some advice on the order I should get each ability etc. Generally forums are for discussion on whatever subject... you either find it interesting to join or not. No offence.
---
Humans are inherently prone to favoritism. So the loot council needs a system to combat that problem, something to base their decisions on or at least use as a control instrument.
---
Yeah I feel like while going for a horizontal approach with most TBC content would be good for a classic+ approach, they still have to add some kind of further on stuff for people. Raiders will still finish naxx and want more and if the more is just easier side content then there isn't much attraction for them. Having even just slight power creep over time wouldn't be too bad over more tiers/time, as long as it was mindful to not be anything nuts like going into tbc was with replacing purples with greens right out the portal.
---
Haha no, if then I'm the one who ganked, but the game is WoW Classic and you should show a little more social behavior just at the beginning. Everyone who has voted me down in the post above will probably know for himself that he should think about it. Otherwise he will have little pleasure in Classic.
---
Id say Shaman. 
---
Totems.
---
 no HoTs and longer cast times leaves less room for error.
---
plus war stomp into heal is really satisfying
---
It sucks a bit that if you plan on dueling a few hours you'll need to pop out to farm every now and then
---
That's genuinely the most toxic thing of the game. It's like in the healthcare system when new workers get shafted simply because it happened to the older staff so now it must happen to you as well. God I hate pvp servers sometimes. 1vs1 ok cool even though you waited for me to drop  to a lil speck of mana while fighting a group of animals.... 2,3vs 1 and more..... Na that's just terrible skill.
---
Isn't launch going to have everything up to and including Naxx?
---
What time does Stress Test 2 begin?
---
Ah, yeah, one of the most boring PvP I've ever had. Two groups standing in front of each others with mages raining Blizzard into each other. The only ones that died were rogues that tried to pick someone off or warriors that accidentially hit their charge button.
---
For the record, there's not a single post of yours I downvoted. I usually appreciate conversation. And I have followed the classic scene as close as anyone could so I'm obviously aware of the preservation aspect, it's not their data to change etc. I have nothing left to understand.
---
To save you the printing you could keep it opened in your phone.
---
Holy fuck I get tired of this question
---
My specific concern is, is it viable to be an off tank/support healer to progress through the content and pvp at the same time. Or do I need to talent specifically to one role?
---
They do, but many People who want to play classic are not subbed rn and they have no intention to play retail.
---
if i am spending ungodly amounts of time looking at someones ass it better be female.
---
They launch WOD so Players Will be able to catch up to retail.
---
&gt; Naxx was a remarkably good time, too.
---
Really? We server firsted (kinda empty server tbh) the entire T1 (wotlk's T1) so quickly that I quit the game afterwards, vividly remembering my thought process being "I'm not gonna farm a raid that is so easy that we got it down in 2 weeks for months on end"
---
I thought Naxxramas was an insult. I was super hyped up for it because I didn't get to do it in classic, but it was a huge letdown to me in terms of how it was executed. The hardest (or one of the hardest) raid in WoW's history at that point had been turned into a loot pinata and I was instantly turned off by it.
---
Shame though, as Ulduar is one of the best received raids ever and I wasn't there for it because of this.
---
I kinda of hope they do progress servers up to WOTLK(mostly because that’s my favorite expansion),
---
Will be there as well being a oomed gnome mage and getting out of nowhere shanked in the back by a rogue is too much for me.
---
Imagine thinking that Vanilla is hard and taking a ret paladin will hinder your chances of clearing a dungeon. Imagine.
---
Thanks for the addon man, keep them coming!
---
Druid, only class I've never enjoyed. I'd rather play a rogue than cat, a mage than balance a warrior than bear or a priest than tree.
---
If it doesn't hit all 5 it means it's not in melee range so it's a fight where your pet can't melee safely. So isn't it better to grab furious howl than nothing at least?
---
I hope we get classic+. Have the devs really think this time and balance around the classic philosophy. Whenever an expansion came out they would crank up the stats WAY too much. Dont remove ability. Add more. Re-balance stuff but keep the idea that "A paladin should not be able to deal the same or more damage as a mage" etc. I will be ok with retri paladins getting alot more damage, but should never be allowed to go above pure dps classses. This would make more specs viable as offhealer could be sought more than a pure dps. Maybe open karazhan since it was supposed to be the final raid of vanilla.
---
You take it too literally. Of course people don't care for the actual karma points, "karmagrab" just refer to people jumping on the current trend to get upvotes, go to the frontpage and such (which people do care about). It's a term with a broader meaning than just the literal sense.
---
BfA hate is just stupid circlejerking and should be excluded by rules on this sub. If we are to talk about BfA this much on here then why even have separate forums for retail and Classic? It doesn't matter if BfA *is* shit, go tell that to r/wow.
---
Private servers run post 1.7 AV though
---
Start with Warcraft 3. Trust me.
---
Something like that. They could release the game without them and it would still be true vanilla.
---
Whats going to be your char name so we can avoid ya? Personally im not going to grt a ret pally unless tbc comes out. But i do have a couple friends who will be leveling a ret pally and we will want to avoid you.
---
Nothing, it will be the end of the world as we know it.
---
Give me yours and I’ll make sure it won’t happen.
---
Lol. How is STV even exciting if there’s no PvP?
---
Yes. From Day 1.
---
Vanilla was still by far the most beginner-friendly MMO back then and anyone that doesn't have the attention span of a squirrel should be fine
---
But stiches only want to play.
---
The only thing in common with all your BG losses is you.
---
Would love to see them one day as part of an ingame addon
---
MC run:
---
"Hi, pls summon"
---
"I'm only 2 mins away"
---
"It's okay we'll wait"
---
Okay is everyone here?
---
"No I am in Silithus pls summon"
---
BfA isn't as bad as people might it out to be, especially not as a newcomer. You have a giant amount of content there if you've never played it before. Plus, it is way better playable for people that don't have several hours of free time per day.
---
Classic on the other hand is ... slow. Very slow. If you have a lot of time, go ahead and try it out.
---
&gt;I'm planning on skinning / Mining as I level
---
GL with bag backspace.
---
Retail is junk dude. I quit after 3 weeks because of how bad it is... legion 0.5. Whoever came up with personal loot at blizzard needs firing.
---
&gt;mass aoe dungeons
---
Big difference in difficulty from TBC rfor sure but Wrath HCs were still harder than MoP, WoD, Legion HCs etc. I still liked them, I never tired of repeating them like I did future hCs, probably because classes were all so fun in Wrath.
---
&gt;dungeon finder
---
That didn't come until near the end of the expac and most of us at the time didn't mind it, it was new, you were grouped with certain realms only. A lot of us didn't have the foresight to see how damaging it would be to the game.
---
&gt;easy and quick questing
---
Wrath leveling had loads of group quests. You're thinking of Cata, Cata changed leveling forever not Wrath.
---
&gt;class homogenization
---
Again, I think you're confused. Classes still had their own identity in wrath. They were butchered later.
---
I don't mind it for raids, it was a splash in the ocean compared to other time sinks there. But when your tank somehow dies several times in 10-man scholomance and wants new healthstones every 5 minutes..
---
Pala has rezz and as druid it will feel like he is slowing you down because you get 30% movespeed at lvl 21
---
The Spinal Reaper was great, but for PvE BRE would be way better.
---
Generally Axes had wonky speeds, funny itemizations, if you want to roll an Orc you'll be better off nolifing up to Rank14
---
Terrible version of AV though. By this patch it's basically been nerfed in half.
---
I played a Hunter in vanilla. I was fucking awful. Made 60 and did some raids and got some experience but my journey to 60 was soured by my extreme nubness of wearing literally any blues I could, regardless of stats and not bothering to feed my pet so they always ran away.
---
if its a few tweaks like reduced cooldowns, better scaling in existing talents/spells. yes please do.
---
i would like tonplay a viable 2h dps shaman in pve.
---
if its introducing new talenst/skills or altering the classes identity (dw shaman for example) then no
---
(exept survival as a melee hunter would be fun)
---
and only balancing on pve, pvp is fucked either way so who cares
---
We make brothers and sisters.
---
That's actually exactly how it works, since the size of the brackets are proportional to the amount of active pvpers on your faction.
---
I ran 0 30 21 druid in vanilla and i got rank 13 and up to Four horsemen in pve
---
It’s gonna be glorious
---
Attendance, performance, out of raid guild contributions, raid readiness. You can also put a random raider on the council for the night. there are a lot of good metrics that good guilds use to determine who gets loot. Good loot councils also have every classes' BiS lists and know who needs what. 
---
A dude who shows up with consumes every night and has an alt with epic blacksmithing plans, and gives his crafting CDs to the guild, and helps fresh 60s farm prebis, is exponentially more valuable to a guild than a raid logger. There's priority systems that go way beyond just showing up or not showing up. 
---
It goes to the optimal user&gt;=it goes to the most deserving
---
I hope TBC...
---
I read that so often but I hated how my main (mage) played in MoP.
---
Lvl90 talents were absolut cancer and had a HUGE impact on the playstyle. 90% of the mage community hated it but our dickhead of a class representative kept pushing for it and RoP is still in the fucking game (although less mandatory than it used to be). It makes me have a really salty taste in my mouth when people bring up how awesome MoP class design was.
---
That said, Challenge modes were generally pretty fun (outside of huge scaling issues with many specs) so overall the class design couldn't have been too bad I guess.
---
These are ace!
---
Here is the thing: Retail will never die. With the technology they use you will always see other players around. Yes they will be faceless randos but they will be there. And it is already like that.
---
I know nothing about the logistics of game development, but is 2 weeks really enough time to add servers if they underestimated their numbers?
---
Gotta add that i only healed in pve. And mostly healed in PvP aswell. I remember loving that spec
---
**&lt;The Dazzle&gt;**

**Loot System:** Loot List / Loot Council. Brief explanation- All guild members will create a small list of items they want from each raid, rating each item as they wish (This is a one time list, created before the first guild raid). A master list will be created and sorted by each individual's rating multiplied by their attendance %. Each time an item drops, the member at the top of the list will be asked if they want the item. If an item drops and the list is empty, it will be distributed via the Loot Council. Direct Message me for more details.
---
**Raid Times:** Monday, Wednesday 7-10 CST. The raid will stop at 10:30, guaranteed. The first official guild raid will be scheduled in late October or early November to give our members \~2 months to reach level 60.
---
**About Us:** Casual/Semi-Hardcore is subjective, so let me break it down for you.
---
* We are a new guild (20 members) that is focused on PvE progression. PvP is welcome and encouraged, but the guild's priority will be raiding. Drama will not be tolerated. Age doesn't matter, as long as you act like a mature adult. We plan on experiencing all of the content, even if it is at a slower pace than others.
---
* If you are a working adult or a student that wants to continue to focus on your schooling, we may be the guild for you. We will not be pushing for server firsts, demanding quick leveling times, or requiring attendance/consumables.
---
* We are only raiding two nights a week, so the raid will be built for the best chance of success. Attendance/BiS Gear/Consumables may not be required, but they will be considered when building the raid and distributing loot.
---
**What We Provide:**
---
* Experienced leadership. Our raid leaders cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ40/Naxx (Up to 4 Horsemen) before TBC released.
---
* A relaxed and mature environment. Jokes, memes, and rippin' on each other in good faith are fair game. Racism and the like will not be tolerated.
---
* Guild first mentality. There will be a lot of dungeon grinding and quest help
---
* Our discord will be full of pinned messages with resources for leveling, dungeons, raiding, professions, add-ons, etc..
---
**What We Expect From You:**
---
* Mature attitude. Be willing to help others without being condescending. Be willing to receive criticism so you can learn and make the guild stronger.
---
* Attuned by first guild raid.
---
* Discord - you are not required to be vocal, but it is expected that you are listening to the raid leaders and responding if necessary.
---
* When it is raid night, we expect you to be there on time, with the proper PvE spec, knowledge of the fights, and a mature attitude.
---
* Loot isn't your first priority. Loot comes slowly in classic, the success of the guild will provide loot for everyone.
---
**Class needs**
---
We are running 1 feral druid and 1 shadow priest in our raids. We are not planning to use a Ret Paladin or a Boomkin at this time.
---
* Druid (Restoration): Medium
---
* Hunter: High!
---
* Mage: High!
---
* Paladin (Holy): Medium
---
* Priest (Disc/Holy): High!
---
* Rogue: High!
---
* Warrior (Off-tank): Low
---
* Warrior (Fury): High!
---
* Warlock: High!
---
If you are interested, please feel free to message me. I will respond as soon as I can.

---

---

---
Priests hands down.
---
I think I have such positive memories of it because we’d gotten to the point where we’d downed a couple of bosses in Classic, but never finished it. Even then, the whole thing felt like a nostalgia trip. We were also coming down off the high of the dumbing down of TBC’s raid content prior to the patch. Those early days of WotLK were certainly faceroll, especially when you had a paladins, death knights, and resto druids in the group (inserting resto Druid because that was me, and I felt grossly overpowered most of the time).
---
My truly best memories of WoW at any point in time are probably from leveling my first character in Classic, the release of Alterac Valley, and - easily - Karazhan. I wasn’t in love with TBC’s overall vibes, but I stuck around the whole time. Even after I outgeared it I never truly got tired of Karazhan.
---
He's a hero!
---
While I feel that, generally, horde is better at PvP...it's only a miniscule amount. I've played both sides off and on since day 1 and the ratio honestly feels about the same. 
---
Both factions will experience games where everyone is running around with their pants on their heads.
---
It is annoying, this question shows up at least once a week... just search for it on reddit and you'll find a lot of discussions
---
Glad you like it ;)
---
Fifa 20
---
the developers basically said "let's see how classic goes first"
---
I actually did unsub back in March because I was fed up with AP and islands and world quests and all of BfA’s bullshit that wasn’t fun, and took a 3 month break. But my guild getting to Mythic Jaina and needing another person for prog, and my urge to get cutting edge after pulling g’huun 300 times last tier and not killing him pulled me back in to raid once again. My guild is honestly the reason I even resubbed though, even after my old raid team breaking down in that same guild, along with a fiasco that had us needing to found a new guild I still stuck with them, I hung out with them when I was unsubbed, and I’ll be sticking with them when classic launches.
---
Enemy castbar and enemy cc duration addon?
---
Ok sorry for the inconvenience
---
The worst part i have found when leveling from 110 to 120 was that you actually get weaker as you level and nothing new waits for you at 120 (no new passives or spells).
---
I removed my example values since i feel like they distract from my original intent of providing a template for people to use. Please copy the document to your google drive to edit.
---
can you drop all 4 with a macro in vanilla? i played a shaman in BC and I can't remember if it was a macro but I could drop all 4 at once
---
I think it should be Vanilla- ! 1.7 4 life.
---
10s and they can have one 😉
---
Spec loyalty is just as strong for me. I'll play Arms even if it's one of the worst in any given patch. 
---
My class fantasy dictates I run around the world with a big 2H and hurt people by hitting them hard.
---
I've tried other classes, I just can't play with that Icky sticky or sparkle boi stuff. Always gravitate back to Arms.
---
Cross was usually second target that id also tank and star was for obscure ccs like shackle, mc, hex, cyclone
---
lvl 58 AV solo Q is a bit stale imo.
---
Well, that was not my point, either. My point was not wanting to accept that you think people have no power, because the uproar of a (not my, btw) whole community (and of course the possible revenue associated with it) was the reason they started to think about making Classic servers in the first place. Of course Blizzard have all the power they could wish for and they can shut down Classic servers whenever they please due to whatever reason. But ultimately, the people playing this game decide what works and what doesn't. And without the Vanilla community and their combined powers Classic would never have happened. Period. It wasn't Blizzard's own idea to make Classic a thing. 
---
If enough people play Classic in the future, it will possibly remain a cash cow and thus servers will run pretty much forever. There's no real point in convincing them to switch back to Retail then. I simply disagree with your opinion that they will somehow try to convert players from one product to the other. Because with every Classic player you try to convince of playing Retail by making it more Vanilla-like, there might also be a Retail player who doesn't like the way Blizzard alters the character of Retail and thus quits playing. Imho, there's really no benefit to anyone in this. 
---
But it's ok really. We can have different opinions and see in two years how this all turned out, if there will be a WoW 2 announcement as you say, and if there will be forced character transfers from Classic to Retail. Because both things really won't happen in my opinion.
---
:D
---
Sttttoooopppp askiiiiinnnnggg thiiiisssssss
---
Your Google-Fu is weak, young grasshopper.
---
of those two the paladin is the better choice but a priest is the best choice
---
Yes, I am. At low levels, certainly. Root is not immune to pushback, full feral doesn't have nature's grasp talented. heals are not immune to pushback. you have no hamstring. You cannot potion without dropping bear form and a lot of your mitigation. 
---
Like I said, druid is vastly more powerful. I went from having the tools to survive a double pull, to that just being normal play. But in terms of getting yourself out of a tight situation? There is a massive difference from a health potion in defensive stance with a 2 hander, and one in defensive stance with a shield, and there is a hell of a gap between hamstring and entangling roots.
---
 &lt;The New Kingdom&gt; (name is a filler name and will be changed before release)  Alliance :Alliance: Oceanic PVP Raid times: New Zealand!!, to be decided. (likely in the evening on either Thurs/Fri/Sat night)  
---
Who we are: A bunch of buddies from a long-running New Zealand social discord server who are keen to play Classic together. Some WoW retail veterans, some newbies. I'm an experienced ex-raid leader who has played every retail expansion and ran multiple guilds, including one with 1k members. I've also cleared up to Molten Core on a classic private server. 
---
Our vision: a competent yet semi-casual PvE and world PVP guild, putting fun, friendship and fully immersing ourselves in the game as priority, with efficient grinding min/maxing and lack of sleep being optional! We intend to stay small enough to retain a close-knit identity, while also raiding with a sister guild to down 40man content.  What sets us apart:  -We have an awesome active social discord and do regular meetups in real life all over New Zealand!   -We will allow people to raid as any spec/race/class, including sub-optimal ones (within reason) Yes - you can raid as ret or boomkin and we will gear you (eventually...)!   -We are also looking for experienced people to be our officers and help lead the guild - you could be part of something new and great! Until classic releases our discord server is going to be for general/social discussion.

Classic and WoW Battle For Azeroth are 2 completely different Games.   
---
If you want to spending countless hours grinding/dying/corpse-running/lost/stuck in dead-end quests  
---
then I would go with Classic, it also takes a fckn long time to Level and you will get killed a billion times  
---
.... But the rewards are insane, all that effort is 100% worth it in the end for that feeling of accomplishment   
---
If you want to enjoy the game as it is now, level pretty fast, get into end game, try out all the dungeons and see most of the world - be able to fly etc etc - Id go with Battle for Azeroth for now to be honest   
---
Just play classic when it comes out and compare and contrast how you feel.   
---
I can tell you now though that classic will feel so much fkn harder than up to date WoW
---
Why is that E so weird?
---
I think this brings up an interesting point about classic that I dont see many people talk about. While we are going back to classic wow content, the community is much different. There will be people pulling bosses, afk healers, people leaving at the first sign of a wipe, and blaming others. It might even be worse with the knowledge the community has now. People will tell balance druids and ret pallies that theyre playing the wrong spec and refuse to invite them to the group. Everyone will be trying to get gear ASAP for themselves with hunters rolling on warrior weapons and warriors rolling on rogue gear.
---
While the game will be classic, the community has changed. Maybe people will be more polite and less antogonizing since their realm reputation might matter. Maybe that wont matter and the community will use new add-ons to find groups without every having to say a word. We wont know until the game is launched.
---
I imagine it will be more like the zombies in world war Z
---
People talk about it because they love the game and are sour about the direction that it has gone. Excited as they are about Classic retail, they don’t like that they have to resort to playing a perpetually stagnant game from now on in order to get to enjoy it. I think most of us on some level wished retail had just retained a bit of its soul with the new expansions. Maybe if they hadn’t changed the game so much, we’d be complaining about that by now, but it’s hard to say. It’s hard to argue, though, that WoW retail is not a bastardization of what the vision for the game was and what originally drew in so many players. WoW’s peak in popularity, after all, was back when the game was still fundamentally still itself. Now it’s some sort of shell of its former self.
---
That said, I don’t think any of us are upset that some people like retail. It’s just safe to say that most WoW players, or people who used to play WoW, do not in the aggregate.
---
Honestly it is annoying. You get used to it, vut never like it.
---
Yea sorry if this is annoying i'll delete the post :(

Well someone has been following our conversation closely then, because each and every time I've posted something, my comment has been downvoted almost instantly. Doesn't matter though, just thought it was funny, however it would be nice to have others join the conversation instead of just downvoting.  
---
Anyway, I give up. We are clearly never going to agree about this and in the end its Blizzard who decides what they are going to do, so all of this is pretty pointless.

Agreed. More than once a week though. The post posted 5 min before this asked the same question. I see this one and the classic+ one all the time
---
You remember the names of these?
---
It's the post below. Obvious troll. :).
---
I feel the opposite. I think casual players would more enjoy crafting things for themselves.
---
maybe I was overly dramatic. I just love this game too much
---
1) hunters are the best farmers in the game. warlocks are a close second
---
2) most humanoids drop cloth
---
you can send it via mail, there's a 1 hour delay
---
3) no the brown linen shirt is. requires  1 bolt linen cloth &amp; 1 course thread
---
4) you disenchant greens to get green quality essences, blue's for blue and purples for purples
---
But we cannot discuss that as you've already clarified you want to spec based on your subjective factors that we cannot know about.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I feel like this is asked at least 10 times a day.
---
Perfect thanks!
---
This is such a forced meme.
---
Whatever floats your weird little boat!
---
I leveled 3 Shamans to 60 and I always rolled Ele. You get gear for heals(both speccs need Int and Mana) and a lot of useful talents from the resto-tree later on aswell! Also its much more fun in my opinion than waiting for Windfury Crits to hit. Elemental Shaman requieres occasional kiting and decent movement skills, but you can basically solo most of the Elite quests. Also you rule in PvP! Most peeps think you are enhancer and while they try to keep distance to you, you just crit them away with Lightning Bolts and Chain Lightning. Fun times ahead :).
---
Osrs does 75% as the majority
---
Only lazy and bad players consider being "tryhard" or "elitist" a bad thing.
---
It's the same thing as neck beard
---
although i always liked tbc i think it wont work and it will take more time and efford to rebalance everything to lvl 60. and while we are at it, do we use the 70 talents with only 60 levels? they changed a lot about most hybrid classes which gave them a whole new feeling and style. pala/sham both sides.. etc 
---
you would open up soooo much conflict potential and its basically a new game. (for better or worse)
---
in my opinion a classic+ would only be viable if it is set in existing bot not used zones in azeroth. there are already a ton of suggestions to use.
---
just give the classes a few balancing changes and keep to the classic Philosophie.
---
blizzard could do a seperate tbc server with lvl70 and maybe even tbc+ but i think those projects wount have as many supporter as the classic+
---
Personally I think it's doable but you'll have a hard time convincing a guild you warrant a spot in their raids - 40-man raids have around 8 healers and it's not likely an off-healer will be needed. - [Here](https://imgur.com/a/xQOcscA)'s one way you can balance Off-tanking with Healing while also balancing PvE with PvP.
---
That being said, I think it will be extremely efficient in BG PvP.
---
Because of a priest lol
---
From what I remember people saying about classic, if your class healed, you pretty much had to heal.
---
I know this doesn't answer your question, but I'm thinking people really don't know which is better. So you can try out your favorite and come back with results.
---
Or just let them die

I agree, and when the decisions are backed by that and explainable to the raider, it works great. And it is in my opinion the best system under those conditions.
---
It just has the potential to go horrible wrong as well. Some guys on the loot council are friends with this person but not the other, so they see how much work they put in but don't recognize the equal amount done by the other guy. Regularly talking with part of your players but not the others, clique building, politics. What do you do, if some class gains more from the gear than another class, do you favor raid progress over rewarding players for work done? Are all players on board with that decision?
---
Any kind of DKP system is easier in that regard, it might not be optimal for progress and some edge cases might not be rewarded/punished as they should be, but at least it is easy to understand for everyone and easy to keep free from tampering as it is just a bunch of rules and math.

Most people aren't pvp'ers, they'll take their pve spec and use that all the time.
---
Downranking doesn't necessarily mean more buttons. In most cases you simply "graduate" from one rank to another depending on gear upgrades and content.
---
And despite Priests having a massive toolbox, the majority of it won't be used outside of very niche scenarios (because of the severe mana inefficiency).
---
With that said, Shaman have to maintain Totems, which does increase depth a little bit, but in the end you are still spamming chainheal while watching totem timers.
---
Thanks!
---
I hope you later realize how sad you look in this exchange.
---
Yea sorry posted this before checking posts below :)
---
There was never a macro to drop all 4, it was a built-in system that made you able to preset what totems to drop when you pressed the button. Unsure what expansion that was but definitely after BC.
---
&gt;That didn't come until near the end of the expac and most of us at the time didn't mind it, it was new, you were grouped with certain realms only.  A lot of us didn't have the foresight to see how damaging it would be to the game. 
---
I vividly remember blizz saying back then that the LFG tool resulted in the most praise they had ever gotten  for any new feature. I guess you could say "We thought we did, but we didn't." I also remember that the first dungeon I did using the LFG tool was also the first dungeon I've ever done where nobody said a single word during the entire run.
---
Can any1 link that spec here?

Looks great, thanks for sharing!!
---
You’re such a cool guy it’s unbelievable.
---
Can I shake your hand?
---
I was going to spit on this guide, because they showed the survival spec as the try-hard best pve spec in the intro. But they said you need +1000 agi to make it viable which is accurate. So it's only obtainable in full T3 and ZG world buff.

---
Usually just respec. Some classes can do ok with their pvp spec in raids, but most people respec a lot. I know Shaman can heal raids in their 30/0/21 pvp spec.  
---
No shame in playing on a PvE server.
---
knowing exactly what you mean with combat not feeling rogue enough, i usually play sinister strike/rest in assassination til 30, then respec hemo (0-0-21) then filling out dirty deeds and prep, before heading down to relentless strikes in assass, following up with cold blood
---
You might want to rethink that, Druid.
---
Could u link an example spec like this? I think about druid as casual player.
---
Instant death
---
Unless you roll on a PvE server.
---
If you're going Sub without using daggers you might as well just go Combat. You can still stealth and open with Cheap Shot, makes no difference in that aspect, but you'll also be a lot safer if you over pull, especially with Riposte being a 10 energy Backstab (in terms of damage) and disarm the target.
---
If you want to go sub for levelling you should go daggers and focus on killing things with Ambush. Again, if you're set on using non daggers, combat.
---

---
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
---
Stop thinking that everything hardcore fringe raiders do is going to be the norm for everyone else. Your raid isn't going to waste time going out and getting world buffs when they'll die 15 minutes into Molten Core on trash mobs. You're not going for best in the world times. You're just going in casually and aren't required to do anything you don't want.
---
here's a quick version of it  
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxuxsczdxVxsoxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxuxsczdxVxsoxo)
---
Priests. You have the biggest heal kit in the game by far. 
---
Shamans press totems, but that's not so much decision making as it is refreshing.
---
&gt; there's like 3x5 man groups competing for every mob
---
Exactly what Classic will look like for at least some months.
---
my only subjective factor is the enhanced stealth (Master of deception and camouflage). 
---
But as I said, I left a build at level 42 and asking if its better to continue to Sub, go assassination or continue to combat. If thats not enough for discussion for you because the only thing you can think of is the combat sword spec then by all means dont discuss it :P Again no offence.
---
This!

That makes me a saaaad panda

Genious. I will macro it into my Cheap Shot.

&gt; Big difference in difficulty from TBC rfor sure but Wrath HCs were still harder than MoP, WoD, Legion HCs etc. I still liked them, I never tired of repeating them like I did future hCs, probably because classes were all so fun in Wrath.
---
Idk man. I only remember doing the 3 ICC dungeons on my Druid, watching Netflix on one monitor while tabbing into WoW every 30 seconds to cast a Wild Growth. That was basically all I had to do.
---
People would just round up all the mobs, AoE them down, kill the boss, repeat 2 times. That was WotlK heroics to me.
---
I LOVED the Cata heroics at release. I LOVED them. They were almost perfect (could have used a bit more open design. Think Shattered Halls vs BRD. One is basically a long corridor, the other an organic place with lots of turns and crossroads and optional stuff).
---
You actually needed to pay attention, use interrupts and CC and there were such little skill expressions as jumping when the Rock guys in Stonecore did their ground slam (moderately big AoE damage to everyone standing on the ground, non if you jumped at the right time). I was so hyped for WoW coming back on track but the community at that time was full of Wrath Babies who couldn't handle anything that took any amount of skill. Shame. 
---
&gt;Wrath leveling had loads of group quests. You're thinking of Cata, Cata changed leveling forever not Wrath.
---
Not at all. I vividly remember being awestruck by being able to solo elite quests in TBC, something that wasn't possible in classic. WotlK didn't really require any group play at all. Sure you could, but you could just as easily level single player without having to grind mobs for a lack of single player quests.
---
&gt;That didn't come until near the end of the expac and most of us at the time didn't mind it, it was new, you were grouped with certain realms only. A lot of us didn't have the foresight to see how damaging it would be to the game.
---
I named it because it goes hand in hand with easy dungeons. Cata really showed us that random matchmaking and challenging content don't go hand in hand. I get your point, though. It wasn't really a key feature that defined WotlK.
---
&gt;Again, I think you're confused. Classes still had their own identity in wrath. They were butchered later.
---
Yea that one was a gamble. When did they start with bring the player not the class? Wasn't that even in TBC, though? I mean homogenization started with both factions getting shamys/pallies, everyone getting self heals, etc pp. 
---
But yea, like the dungeon finder part this was more groundwork for horrible stuff later than an actual problem in the expansion itself. I see your point here.
---
Still I think WotlK had awful difficulty. Naxx was a travesty and Dungeons (I stand by that) were a total joke that made people so unhappy that Blizzard tried going back to harder ones with Cata, so it was certainly a problem that warped the community's view on the expansion.
---
Overall, though, outside of the difficulty (which TO ME is VERY fundamental for my enjoyment) I do understand better why people look back so fondly. Many of the problems I identify for Wrath didn't really become apparent problems until after Wrath, so people's memory of WotlK is not tainted by them.

Im the 4th head : horde premade bg 99% wins. Its the one with dark circles around the eyes and rather be in the cave then ouside in the sun.
---
Honestly one of my best dungeon groups every was 2x shamans (me as enhance and a resto shaman) and 3 dps warriors. We cheweed through everything super fast - no one died.
---
He's getting at the fact that there's no server community or reputation to care about in retail. Everyone is randomly assigned to the group and chances are you'll ever see them again.
---
I think he wants that changed. I do at least. Keep group finder for convenience, make it server wide only. It'd change the game a fair bit. Also remove cross realm sharding and just merge realms if needs be.
---
If your dps is pulling mobs you give them a warning, if they do it again you kick them, eventually they will learn it's not their job and if not they won't get groups.

Weekend
---
Looking for a guild that raids primarily on the weekend. Friday 8PM-Midnight, Saturday any time, Sunday anytime until around 10PM
---
I am planning on playing a either a mage or a feral druid. Would love to off tank, but if tank spots are full I will level the mage. Going to take PTO and hopefully get to 60 in the first two weeks.
---
I do play during the week however I don't really have a 3 or 4 hour block that I can play without interruption.
---
Basically what I want is Master of Deception and Camouflage. I am not saying is impossible to use stealth without those talents... but it is much better with them and I am willing to sacrifice some damage for extra fun (subjective, but this is me). I also like 2 or 3 talents in imp sap as well but this not so important for me.
---
I didnt say I dont want daggers, I just dont wanna spec for them specifically because I dont know if  I will be able to find good daggers while leveling..
---
You might have just made a new warlock main ;-)
---
You are completely missing the point, though. I am well aware of why people hate on BfA. I don't like it either but I wholeheartedly wish it would be enjoyable. That is beside the point.
---
But this is r/Classicwow, not r/fuckBfA. It is understandable that people are upset about BfA, but luckily there is a forum *exactly meant for discussing retail WoW, called* r/wow*.* The *only* reason to bring posts about BfA to the Classic forum instead of the intended forum is because people know a ton of people here will jump on any chance to hate on BfA, resulting in a ton of upvotes - which is why I call it a karmagrab.
---
Discussing BfA here is not relevant to the sub. Should I also start discussing the Warcraft RTS games here? Of course not, just because it is part of the Warcraft franchise does not mean it is relevant to the Classic forum - there is a reason why it is called classicwow.
---
I didn't even reach 120. Used the free boost on a priest and found I could solo elite mobs by just spamming smite. Once I realised I was basically invincible by pressing 1 skill I just laughed and never logged back on.
---
That's why you join a PvP guild. If the ganker has a PvP guild it could end up a full on war.

Likewise.
---
Oh you are fine then.
---
Well that’s it. I have to roll mage now.
---
You can literally just go travel form and run away if needed.  Druid and Warrior are the two classes  I’ve played into the ground in vanilla content and I strongly disagree with your assessment.  Warrior is amongst the worst (if not the worst) for surviving bad pulls, while Druid is amongst the best (if not the best).
---
Love the Gnomeregan, Scarlet Monastery and Scholomance, they have that old-school horror title vibe going.
---

Great work! Since it\`s free to use to everybody, I might invest some hours to translate it into german, to use it on german servers also :-)
---
Imo half work, other half the colors/theme don’t match
---
The good thing about healing in Classic is, that it is always more about decsion-making than the other more straight-forward roles.
---
Things to take into consideration are hps, mana-efficiency and even psychology of your group members. (As in: When you deliberately let them drop low in order to best use the 5-second-rule, they might panic and waste a cooldown or even worse start running around.)
---
Proper mana-management in a 5 man makes a huge difference for the speed of the run and it feels really rewarding to be good in that regard.
---
Healer playstyle dramatically differs between being the only healer in a group or being one of many healers in a raid.
---
Healing in raids is much more about proper coordination beforehand then making decisions on the fly. I'd say it's a lot less fun than 5-mans. Raid-healing often is more of a whack-a-mole-competition where people don't care about mana-efficiency in order to top the meters.
---
Being assigned tank-healer is even worse. You'll cast the same heal over and over and when shortly before the heal is finished, the tank is still full, you sidestep to interrupt your heal.
---
In regards of your question. I think as long as you avoid Palading you'll be fine. The issue with Paladin is that due to a specific talent, their fastest heal is also their most mana-efficient-one. This really leads to the situation where you just spam one button and also by design are the best whack-a-moler.
---
Except of that I'd choose the class for what else it has to offer besides healing.
---
I think Priest might be you best bet for a very simple reason: In 5 mans you can spend the time where you are not actively healing with wanding... which is a big plus to decision-making as wand-shots cause a gcd and thus require a bit more foresight.
---
Wanding is much better than the other healers no-manacost-ways of contributing damage.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear\_of\_missing\_out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) 
---
Blizzard knows what they're doing
---
**Fear of missing out**
---
Fear of missing out, or FOMO, is "a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent". This social anxiety is characterized by "a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing". FOMO is also defined as a fear of regret, which may lead to a compulsive concern that one might miss an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, a profitable investment, or other satisfying events. In other words, FOMO perpetuates the fear of having made the wrong decision on how to spend time since "you can imagine how things could be different".Self-determination theory (SDT) asserts that the feeling of relatedness or connectedness with others is a legitimate psychological need that influences people's psychological health.

Fair, and don't get me wrong I enjoy wpvp when the levels are closer therefore @60 it's fun but you need to have a good guild set up that they're willing to drop everything and just go and help you're under leveled ass wherever you may be. Pvp guilds sound funner to me IMHO than hardcore raiding guilds. It is harder for a pvserver to have full out guild wars but when classic comes out.... I might just do what you suggested.

---
You might also consider a Shred Feral Druid in a duo. Can regen mana while in cat form so not so much drinking, off-heals, Thorns etc.. At max level you will also have an alt that can solo farm + herb fast.
---
[Incendicite ore](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=25735/incendicite-ore) would be my guess.
---
Umm... There's a table of contents you can look at to see what zones they go to in different level ranges. Idk if you know how guides work, but they try to optimize the times it takes to level. If they're going there at that level then more than likely the zone's quests are centered around that level and it's a good time for you to go there too.
---
I am not sure what I want to roll yet..  
---
I played a hunter back in vanilla, and I have always loved that class and it is still my main on retail.
---
It does look like there will be alot of hunters in classic WoW so have been thinking about going warrior for tanking istead maybe.
---
After raiding Naxx with my ultimate Ironforge dwarf, I decided to up the ante to forge my own journey from scratch.
---
it wasn't broken in all of classic, it just happened to be broken in the true vanilla patch
---
Nah that's the joke i care about meters so much even as a tank i am going to go DW/Defiance asap so our guild can dps even harder.
---
For me the release date let me calm down a bit. Diablo 2 ladder reset pretty much allowed me to ignore the hype for a month or so. I'll be getting excited in another month or so when we really getting close.
---
Soooo, is beta access potential "hidden" when you aren't subbed? Or is it just some theory you had?

Main and off tank fury/port. Then feral as the 3rd tank is the best. You don't need to be full prot to main tank.

Because the build described above is specifically tailored to do max dps on a dummy, and not meant for any pvp fighting. It revolves around crowd pummeler, stack spellpower, then demands you have setup, uptime, decent procs and things standing in your consecration. 
---
Unless your pvp opponent is a dummy, itll be safer to pick a classic ret based build, control ret builds, reckoning builds or shockadin (which do run spellpower).
---
Feels like a bit of a reach to say that this post is not about Classic by virtue of referencing BfA in a negative way. Nor is it entirely unlikely that the point it’s getting across will actually happen, at least initially.

According to WoWhead the brown linen shirt isnt a green item and thus wont give me the mats I need for the wand, or do I understand something wrong?  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4344/brown-linen-shirt#created-by-spell](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4344/brown-linen-shirt#created-by-spell)
---
I personally don't get salty when it comes to wiping (Progression raiding mentality I guess?) even i dungeons.  
---
so if a DPS pulls, the rule is "If you spank it, you tank it". and if that results in the group wiping, they'll either rage quit or we reset and go agian.
---
obviously repeated offense is a kick and replace.
---
What people will notice is you landing every tranq shot and doing every kite without dying. Or rather, they won't notice that but they will notice every time you fuck those things up.
---
Doing solid dps is icing on the cake, not that you shouldn't max dps like crazy because it's a good way of also showing that you're the better hunter.

---
No offense meant, but this build is pretty bad. If you want to be stealthy and stuff, just put points into Master of Deception and Camo at the most. Get up to Improved Sap though if you want some stellar CC vs Humanoids. I love Imp Sap in general; it's just good. Do whatever you want, but generally Rogues tend to revolve around talents put into Dagger damage/crit(anything with the word Backstab or Ambush) or Sword/Mace Damage/crit(anything with Sinister Strike and Eviscerate). THEN points into Utility/Enhancement talents. There are also a few very particular talents worth noting/reaching; Perparation, Mace Specialization, Adrenaline Rush, Sword Specialization, Cold Blood, and Seal Fate. These are KEY talents for the rogue to have at least One fully invested regardless of what build you have, albeit some of them line up more with general PvE, PvP, or Raiding. You're definitely entitled to do whatever you want though, but I can't give advice on an already funky/undesirable talent build.
---
&gt; I wanna feel like a rogue,  
---
That's what I don't understand. Rogue Abilities and play style already feels hella Rogue. It doesn't get more Rogue than this that I know of. What are you comparing it to in your head? Another MMOrpg and a variant "Rogue" class? With the abilities you get just through levels, talents hardly make a difference IMO. I mean come on, disregarding talents,  you get all sorts of stuns, interrupts, stealth(although talents DO help with that one), excellent damage, vanish, blind, poisons that do all sorts of things, distracting flash pellet things, ambush capabilities, etc. What else are you looking for?
---
Sure, could work. But getting all the mats could be harder, especially if you dont have much gold to buy things. 
---
I'm lucky in that I'm now already in a large guild planned for classic, so will use gathering profs to get gold, and if I need stuff crafted, will ask helpful guildmates.
---
global cooldown on each of them baby
---
Which people? There isn't even any honor or ranks until Phase 2.
---
Back when my guild was working on world first Nef kill in BWL, myself and the other hunters would FD and switch to our goblin jumper cables to Rez dead raid members. 
---
I think they changed that with BC, so now you stay in combat.

&gt;2. Is players in charge of deciding a good thing?
---
maybe not (look at brexit lol) but it could be used as a measurement how much positive or negative feedback it would provide. if they just ask "feature x could be implemented. would change y. do you feel its a good change?"
---
Blizzard could carefully choose which features even get a vote and are not bound to follow it (51/49 could be problematic, 90/10 not so bad)
---
&gt;3. Convincing people to do content which is not an upgrade.
---
t1/t2 have questionable stat distribution, you dont need to in rease the ilvl just the stats to make a t1.2 viable and desireable. maybe give it a nice 3set boni so it can be used in t2/t3 content.
---
its bad to implement a t1 raid after t3 but thats okay, a lot of people will just want to see it. maybe let some more gold drop so its a viable gold farm raid. after all if you have naxx on farm you only need 1 raid day, enough time for a fun raid
---
and if a item has +1stamina more,ita still an upgrade
---
Don’t be such a carebear
---
Hm, I guess you're right, the classic.wowhead stat guide mentions it(in passing)
---
Any site out there with more detailed info?
---
&gt;back then
---
Ok? Now, in 2019, if you're arguing that classic will be friendlier than retail then I'd like to hear but categorically disagree right now.
---
(actually wrong)
---
Naxx was released in June 2006, and the Expansion was out till end of Jan 2007 (so 7 months). Thats a pretty big gap. If there are 5-6 months between Phases, that'd be great. 
---
I've seen many folk say Phase 2 will not occur till January 2020, maybe even later. Thats great in my view.
---
Yeah, more lists need to show options. Since sometimes you just have bad luck trying to get the suggested bis, and you don’t need the absolute bis.
---
No you’ll attract assholes who think they are better players, like yourself actually.

# ⚡  OCEANIC - LATE NIGHT RAIDING ⚡
---
📋 **Guild:** &lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
🌅 **Time Zone**: GMT+10
---
⌚ **Raid times**:  10:00pm - 1:30am Mon/Weds/Thurs (+ Sunday as a reserve night if needed)
---
📋 **Goals**: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
🎲 **Loot**: EPGP or Council (Details TBA)
---
☎ **Contact**: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
🔎 **Info**: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
📥 **Applicants**: Anyone can apply, the leveling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).
---
📖 **Roster**: Positions available for all classes.
---
Join the discord here [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX) and feel free to message if you have any questions.
---
Cheers!
---
No, you are correct. Brown Linen Shirt is cheaper for leveling tailoring but since you're using tailoring to disenchant you should go with Brown Linen Robe
---
You should just trade friends, problem solved =)
---
Such a big man wanting to take someone down a peg.
---
Please teach me how to be a reasonable adult man like yourself.
---
That’s a good idea man. I think the hybrid specs should be pretty close, at least to the point that people don’t mind bringing them along in leu of a pure dps. The biggest problem with not raising the level cap and just adding new gear though is at some point you will have geared level 60,s virtually one shotting fresh 60’s.
---
You will just at for less gold, but in turn sellers must sell they’re wares for cheaper because no one has any gold. I think it will scale. Even if it doesn’t you just hoard the stuff. Corner market later.
---
When dps pulls I usually let them die
---
Hunter: Need summon
---
Warrior: Same!
---
Priest: ME tooo thankxzzz
---
Mage: OMW!
---
Warlock: I need two to summon... and ive been here for 4h already waiting...
---
Well, my last comment was more general about BfA hate post than this one specifically. I figured that to be implied because your previous comment just talked broadly about BfA hate. I figured we were just discussing it in a general sense.
---
I agree with you that this comment has some relevance to classic, but I'd like to refer to my first comment then - it is just a circlejerking karmagrab. People use *\*insert negative thing about BfA\** as an easy way to get upvotes and that seems to be exactly what this post is as well. It is not funny, like the last 100 posts that can be reduced to "Classic gud, BfA bad" wasn't funny. The part that makes people upvote is the "I hate BfA" part. It is not because the *actual* joke is funny, people don't look at this and think "oh haha, 6433 mounts - that is just *hilarious*". If it wasn't for BfA hate those posts wouldn't even exist. So the essence of it is just a karmagrab through BfA hate, which is what I originally commented on.
---
If I accidentally pull and my tank just stands there and goes ”if u pull u tank” Im out in a second lel thats so stupid - not my kind of players atleast
---
Reminds me of old magic cards packs. Nice work!
---
As I said previously. What is the most expedient way to clear content becomes what the average progress guilds do. In world buffs case this is anti fun and unintuitive. Wheres in other versions of the game and currently in retail its not.
---
I think a lot of people will take a mostly PvE spec, and grab a much needed PvP talent perk along the way. Like most MM Hunters for Raids, will probably grab Scatter Shot even though it's rarely useful for Raiding, albeit great for Kiting. There may be some peeps that only PvP or only PvE too, and they probably don't give a shit either way. Good for them. I'll probably raid once or twice a week, and PvP the rest of the Week after a respec. This way I'm not doing it too often. I think the cost resets each week doesn't it? Memory is fuzzy on that one.
---
A lot of the Respec happens as you hit certain levels. Especially at 40 when you reach your first 31 of talent. Some druids take Nature's Grasp (1pt in balance) for the chance to root when attacked for PvP server leveling, some shadow priests take the extra wand damage, some shamans level in enhance till 40 or so then go ele. Some mages Respec near 40 to a more AoE leveling build. Generally you give up some PvP specific survivability or utility talents in place of some over DPS ones. You can do both in either spec really it's just not min/maxd.
---
If you like PvP and pve I would do a PvP server if I were you. It was an amazing experience in vanilla
---
Achievements dropped right before BC came out I think
---
Not just one healthstone, but all the spectrum of them. From rank 1 to rank 7 cause your tank can carry them xD. 
---
Jokes aside I always asked for two healthstones of different ranks in raids, as you could use them both on a single fight. Extra potions off the CDs!
---
On the Darrow Shire PS I was a hunter who ran MC, ZG, ON, aq20. 
---
Didn't run bwl because the realm's population plummeted when the merger was announced.
---
And that's the beauty of Classic. You don't have achievements, but you have reputation on the server. It doesn't matter if you're the first in your profession, it matters if you can craft what people need.
---
Exchange friends with OP!
---
Well i expect every class to do all that they can. I expect a warrior to tank and somewhat know the relevant routes. I expect a mage to supply water and portals and so i expect a warlock to summon people to the entrance.
---
This is when the shaman or druid takes over tanking AND healing.
---
Does it matter?
---
Who cares if you’re the first level 60 on your server?
---
Really the only “achievement” is opening the AQ Gates.
---
We managed just fine without any in vanilla
---
&gt;BiS for druid healers requires tailoring.
---
If memory serves, there are no BoP patterns that Druids use from tailoring. What gear are you referring to?
---
If we had BFA quality skyboxes with the pretty clouds, i'd be so happy.
---
Please try r/wowservers when discussing which private server to play on... thank you!
---
See previous blue posts guy.
---
Right before WotLK. I remember everyone in shattrath jumping down the elevators to get “going down?”
---
achievements came in wrath mate. patch 3.0.1

WotLK best time lol. Literally everything that sucks about the game now was implemented in WotLK besides the talent trees.

&gt;Carebear
---
I do not think it means what you think it means. How is it being a carebear to point out what a circlejerking shitpost this is?
---
Most likely the majority of players will roll around in the spec that suits their greatest interest. PvE players will be running with PvE specs and PvP players are going to run around in PvP specs. Only minority of the playerbase are going to swapping specs constantly to min-max their current activity, because the gold cost is just too much for them. Maybe you can farm a 50g per hour so it's 2 hours to cover your respecs, but if you can only play 10 hours a week, thats 20% of your time spent on just "upkeep".
---

1. We dont know when phase 2 starts  
---
2. Honor system isnt in until phase 2
---
Since the introduction of blood elves way more people have played Horde. Will be interesting to see the faction balance in classic.
---
I'm just saying that the learning curve isn't very steep and nobody has to be a "strong gamer" to figure things out, especially since there is much more information on the internet.  
---
New games catering to people with less than 50 brain cells isn't really relevant here, I doubt you would find those people on reddit.
---
If it's higher iLvl than what you have you can't trade, so even if the stats are shit for your class you still can't tradee
---
Am I missing something? How will he have an alt? It's still just 1 character.
---
I suppose difficulty is subjective.
---
"go go go go go go go go go go"
---
The atmosphere. The story was literally the most anticipated one. The music was gorgeously done. And most importantly, the player count was at peak. Ultimately the highest it's ever been.
---
Sure the expansion when analyzed might not seem that great, but the massive amount of players gave it a very lively feeling. Every corner there were people. And who doesnt love leveling in snowy mountains. 
---
The next expansion after that took a big departure from the story line. They literally just had used up most of their interesting main characters from warcraft. Deathwing?? Big bad dragon? Sure. But I just don't feel personally attached to the villain. And I never even did at the end. 
---
Mist of Pandaria was amazingly done. But it saw the least initial surge in players. Why? My opinion: pandas lol. As much as we love it now, people back then hated the new panda thing. It felt childish and not warcraft like. It was a bad decision to market the kung fu panda side so much. (Yes I know I know they were there in the warcraft game but who the fuck even paid attention to those few characters)
---
See I want to switch it up this time. I played a hunter the first time around, got my epic quest now, winterspring mount ect. This time I wanna go with a meele class, but can’t decide between warrior or rogue lol

**&lt;Nebula&gt;**
---
(EU PVP Alliance)
---
**About Us:**
---
Nebula began as a small group of friends, some of who have lived the vanilla experience given to us in 2004, some of us haven’t. Some of us hardcore, some are not.
---
Yet the main goal for all of us is the same. This is a game we are super excited about launch and simply put can’t wait for the fun times ahead. We are a group of adults, 
---
from each corner of Europe. We love banter and a good atmosphere.
---
Guild reputation is important to us. So, whether your jam is smashing skulls in AV, grinding Timbermaw rep or competing with us in end game content, Nebula would be happy to host your stay. We also foster a very active Discord which has grown steadily along with the build up towards launch in August!
---
Our philosophy is: **For the guild, not a person.**
---
**Our Goals:**
---
Straight up raiding. Our ranks include many highly experienced players who have spent 14 years raiding on wow. Our raiding environment will be serious, yet positive and enthusiastic. 
---
If raiding isn’t your jam, our ranks also include many socials/ pvpers who are here for ride! 
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday + Thursday + Sunday 18:30 - 22:30 BST (or 19:30 - 23:30 EU server time). 
---
**Recruitment:**
---
Recruitment has been very positive as we inch towards launch. We still have slots for the following specs:
---
Mage x 4
---
Resto Druid x 1
---
Warlock x 1
---
Rogue x 1
---
DPS Warrior x 1
---
**Application:**
---
Please apply via this link: https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnNEavPo4j?i=x4oZnqGA.
---
Or contact Shane#2310, Zyepox#1969, Ethario#1412 or Nakkie#3039 on Discord.
---
It didn't happen on private servers and it won't happen on retail classic.  The guild you join is not going to make you get world buffs.  They're going to take 10+ pugs to fill empty slots.  
---
No one is going to make you get world buffs.  When you die, you lose them.  There's no point for a casual guild to even bother.
---
LFM MC, link AQ40 achievement.
---
Same with the warlock trinket, the staff is tempting but quickly replaced in DM. The trinket is always useful when farming maraudon or if you've just run out of shards.
---
Youtube "Skarm tank". He talked about running HotW NS for raids. He had a video of them clearing AQ40 using the hybrid build and maintanking some ZG bosses. You have all the important talents for healing and are only missing out on moonglow or swiftmend. The only tank talents missing are 3% crit for threat. If you really want a raid spot farm out the resist gear.
---
You gonna expect to be paying a tax since you’re too lazy to walk homie
---
The basic warlock leveling rotation is Voidwalker &gt; Corruption &gt; Wand then if you want a shard you drain soul. Pretty much every caster is reliant on their wands.
---
For some classes it's not even just about PvE vs. PvP.
---
For them it can be solo vs 5 man vs raid vs pvp.
---
So finding a compromise just adds a layer of depht.
---
I usually felt that the difference for the optimal raid-spec was not worth giving up talents that are usefull in every aspect except for raids.
---
Can you link in the comments your original with values
---
They didn't say there was more or less competition, they said all the competition get the same faster queue times.
---
Don't know how it is nowadays  but in the past they always put up a patch(2.0/3.0) before the actual expansion and that patch introduced some of the new features coming in with the expansion.
---
No, think he's going to main a priest solo first.
---
PRE-BRD gear.  It's not bop but it's expensive buying it.  I'd rather spend that gold on a mount.
---
Retail wont recover,its will become more barby style game.
---
Classic + tbc+++ will print them money  and I would say they should create a new wow or just give up or just keep selling for kidos reskins.
---
Well thanks for the answer. I will look into ways to change the build and only put MoD and Cam. When I said wanna feel like rogue, I mean being stealth that dont get caught from 5 meters away and dont move like a turtle while on it.  Will try something like this then: 
---

---
This happens regularly with new expansions though since it's usually a hard reset on player power. Now WOTLK-&gt;Cata, that was one hell of a transition. Most DPS classes had near 100% crit chance if they geared for it and that had to be chopped down to less than 20% for the start of Cata, then HP pools had to inflate from 20K as a normal max to 100K at the start of Cata. They were good changes because WOTLK got way out of control with stat growth and Cata was a chance to tone it back, but boy was that transition rough.
---
People don't remember running to the dungeon after spending 30 minutes in trade looking for a healer, only for the healer to DC before the first boss and having to go back to a city to spam for a new healer.
---
Hunter in vanilla, druid in classic (slightly torn between shaman).
---
This guy cliparts
---
Review the phases. PvP is p2. People are speculating that people will get AQ40 equivalent epics prior to, or early into BWL patch.
---
Yet we have no idea what the release schedule is, p2 may be a very short phase.
---
Yeah these are subjective, i just don't like the shapeshift shuffle of druid. Mage QOL mainly due to portals and AOE farming.
---
hybrids dont need to top the meters due to utility, but doing only 50% damage of a dps is to much of a gap.
---
i can only speak for shamans (melee) but there are ways to increase pve potential without fucking up pvp.
---
for example, removing the 20% nature debuff on stormstrike (nerfing ss+es combos) reduce the cooldown to 10sec and give it a selfbuff for 12sec adding 10% spelldamage (frostshock raid viable) which stacks up to 30%
---
so we would end up with a 30% shock damage increase after 30sec fights. you have to reapply the buff in 2sec so you need to know your movement and timing. more sustain pve damage, a little less pvp burst
---
the 2h talent could get a -max damage but +haste buff. same principle. 
---
more hits more wf procs better sustain damage but a little less burst for pvp
---
(values are ofcourse only placeholders, would need a lot of testing and calculations)
---
&gt; I think the cost resets each week
---
I think the costs only reset when there was a class-rework. :o
---
&gt; What changed between now and wotlk that people say the game is shit now but was best then?
---
We didn't have sharding/CRZ back then. As one of the few MMOs that has a seamless world, having that feeling of persistence get tossed out by having people/objects pop in and out is a pretty big deal IMO.
---
Comparing ICC heroics to the rest of the heroics isn’t really fair IMO as their primary function was to give free loot so people could be geared for ICC Raif. 
---
They were designed as a free gear boost.
---
Some heroics could be pretty tricky in Wrath if you weren’t absurdly over geared.
---
Aye, tank should always pick up the slack. Cause the alternative is a certain repair bill. If you however die, then it is 100% the DPS fault that pulled. I can accept DPS pulling for me as tank. However it can vary. I however do not agree when I pull a group and the hunter (Always a fucking huntard) pulls ANOTHER group at the same time. Thats when they get ONE warning and thats it.
---
This might be why I didn't play as much WoW as I'd want to, from day 1 I play Horde, they vanilla, I've wanted few times to go Alliance so I could play with my friends, I just couldn't, loved pretty much all the Horde races in the beginning, alliance not so much, well except for dwarfs but didn't like the starting zone, in panderia and after I did move more and more to alliance (thx to death knight and boost), but besides MoP, the gameplay then turned to crap.
---
Thanks, this is really helpful for deciding what i want to play! I keep re-reviewing each choice but priest comes out on top for me...
---
This really affected me and i just died.
---
we can go deeper...
---
Same
---
Go pally, Those blessings are super strong and the ability to give them BOF whenever they get CC'd will allow you to have them wreck everything in your path. Plus free mount at 40.
---
for me quality of life means being able to spam one key in raids and still do great dps ;)
---
Hunters also get crit and dodge from Agi which makes it the prefered stat
---
Honestly it's two different games, some people will play both but most people will play one or the other. 
---
I still think retail will have wayyy more players. Many people who haven't played vanilla will go and play and be disappointed, while the niche community who still like and have the time to play vanilla will do so. 
---
For me? I just don't have the time to dedicate to vanilla, its 100 times more a grind than vanilla. Being a grown up now with a family and kids. No time for vanilla wow.
---
I think my brain just had an aneurysm reading that
---
Imagine people being fine with spending an additional 30minutes in a dungeon because someone wants to take meme specs with them.
---
Computer HARD
---
i am!
---
nice try, noobs.
---
You'll be able to start the game while every single other person is also level 1 versus starting a game where there are thousands of max levels. You will grow with and help shape the game(server).

[My Personal Preferences](https://imgur.com/a/6FKWkAF)
---
OP just ignore this guy, this guy is only here to comment something retarded... If your gonna stop at Sub then maybe take the rest into combat. Or go full sub. I will personally be doing Combat as the DMG is too good to pass up..
---
Heres what I would suggest for u as you like sub
---
Level 60 Rogue (5/13/33)
---
Assassination (5 points)
---
Improved Eviscerate - Rank 3/3
---
Increases the damage done by your Eviscerate ability by 15%.
---
Remorseless Attacks - Rank 2/2
---
After killing an opponent that yields experience or honor, gives you a 40% increased critical strike chance on your next Sinister Strike, Backstab, Ambush, or Ghostly Strike. Lasts 20 sec.
---
Combat (13 points)
---

---
Just something I put together. Change it if u want but that should be good
---
There a difference between an "accident" pull and a "pull because I wanna go fast". Its the latter that the OP is making a joke out of.
---
I can recover or manage a small accident pull. But I'm not going to manage a pull because someone is impatient for the healer to drink, or me to have a good amount of HP to start.
---
And in vanilla, getting the initial pull as a tank is paramount to have good established threat, otherwise all the mobs go everywhere and that's more stress on the tank and healer.
---
Sure but I'm not looking to see where I should go. I'm looking for a list of ALL zones.
---
In my opinion I like the thought of flying but only in certain zones like Outland, storm peaks etc and then don’t let people fly in other zones. So just limited flying basically.
---
I loved playing Warlock. You just gave me a vietnam flashback.
---
Weren't they basically a joke in WC3 though?
---
I mean, when it comes to finding DPS for dungeons, it is definitely a “buyers market” for the group lead.
---
If I get whispered by a rogue and a ret pally, you can probably guess who is getting the invite and who isn’t.
---
Nice try, hacker. /s
---
**Looking for Guild**
---
**Faction:** Alliance, would do Horde for right guild
---
**Server:** PvE
---
**Time Zone:** EST, fine with other time zones assuming raiding hours work out
---
**Raid Times:** 8-12 EST Sunday - Thursday, preferably 2 - 3 nights a week
---
**Class:** Warrior, maybe rogue/mage depending on if I'm feeling froggy
---
**Looking for:** Semi-hardcore or casual guild that is able to push through content at a good pace without being too tryhard and having a good time with guild doing it
---
**About Me:**
---
* Been playing since Launch Day, raided at a semi-hardcore level from Vanilla - Cata before retiring from raids
---
* I am a laid-back, mature adult who has slightly warped sense of humor and a love for Vanilla and its demanding nature
---
* Definitely don't have the time to play WoW like I did in college, but I have a week of PTO to burn for launch week and work from home on a regular basis, so I intend to play a good amount
---
* I like tanking romantic walks through dungeons and raids, getting gear for myself &amp; guildies while trying to have a good time
---
**Raiding Exp:**
---
* Played Warrior from Day 1 to early part of WoTLK, swapping to Rogue to fill huge class/DPS need for guild
---
* Raided as MT or OT/fury from MC to 3/12 Naxx in Vanilla; MT or fury up to SWP in BC, getting pre-nerf Kael; swapped to Rogue doing all heroic content in WoTLK and large amount of heroic in Cata before retiring
---
**Contact:**
---
* **Discord:** Graeson#9598
---
* **Battlenet:** Graeson#1825
---
that happens in every single scenario in wow history, several people carrying the same unique weapon, plus it makes sense that a legendary hero that defeated so much evil is a chosen one no?
---
Wrath was still server-only (or battlegroup only in some cases). Despite all the quick and easy ways to avoid social interaction you'd still see familiar faces a lot. I believe this expansion struck the balance of friend making abilities with ease of doing things. All xpacs after obviously pushed toward ease of doing things and left features behind that brought long lasting friendships. While just my opinion, I also think pvp was best either in TBC or in Wrath.
---
They will most likely pace the PvE content the same. Phase 2 is pretty much patch 1.3 Ruins of Dire Maul, which came out exactly 4 after release. If they want to pace it the same that could leave phase dropping end of December beginning of January. 
---

---
I'd expect ST quests, Thorium Brotherhood quests, Silithus non-repetitive quests to be available from day 1. Just like Mara.
---
I still remember very early in Wrath the forums begging for nerfs to Loken and another which I can't recall. They were definitly easier than TBC HCs but I remember struggling on my holy pally to keep people alive in Halls of Reflection. 
---
Maybe I suck? But I remember having to pay attention in groups were people were fresh 80, certainly no alt tabbing for me.
---
Yea, I definitely missed something lol
---
Yep. No Achievements. No silly participation medals. Just Blizzard Server Logs that record general activity and messages. You'll know who hit 60 first, since Twitter is a thing since 2006, and Blizzard is active on it and can tweet this day and age. I'm sure they'll tweet out who was "first this" and "first that". At least for Leveling and Raiding. Otherwise your "Achievement" is having something to actually display or use around people, as opposed to a cute shiny badge. You've also got local server Reputation to be concerned about - So don't be a dick to other players/guilds. It WILL come back to haunt you, heavily. It's a little creepy, but people are also extraordinarily good at finding out Alts of Mains. It's even easier since there is now a Blizzard ID, whereas back in the day it merely went by a Character Name. 
---
Someone might get permission to make a leaderboard based off of info delivered from Blizz servers. Or Blizzard might do it themselves. Seems reasonable, but who the hell knows. Hopefully Blizz will allow or do something like this, since I feel a lot of people enjoy leaderboards.
---
And they made few patches ago mobs harder:d Use to be even more easy.
---
If you're going priest already it might be nice to take druid for something different. They are sooo versatile
---
Except there certainly is a thing called casual guilds. Emphasis on *casual*. You know, guilds that are perfectly comfortable with just doing MC ZG and bashing their face into BWL. Are they going to go above and beyond? Not at all. But there were, and will be guilds that act that way. I just won’t be playing in them.
---
They have an almost arcade feel to them... as if these were stand alone games in some classic Blizzard arcade. 
---
Nice work!
---
Then be sure to let them know it was on accident
---
Don't blame you, vanilla is the purest form of wow :)
---
I always thought it was one of the early things you learn. It's quite important to, well, you know... staying alive.
---
Druid - people not respecting the giant lazor chicken
---
Warrior - your life sucks for a massive portion of the game.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/#fullmenu
---
You can't /camp and go back to the start of the instance in Classic. So yeah, no DM exploits that make massive amounts of gold.
---
true, on ely i was kinda mind-blown by the cost of food and water while leveling.  I've leveled on a few pservers over the years but dont really remember needing food+water that much
---
(was a druid on ely btw)
---
Real awesomeness.
---
So there are two specs that are good and that i like to run. One is a pve leveling build the other is pvp leveling build.
---
The pve leveling build is [This](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tYt8t9t_t.t~ufuguhuivet-uaubucu2u3u4uquwyUuuuvu.tmtwtvthtrtitNtOtPtQvdtdtFtGtHtItjtJtKtLtXtMtZt0t1JTJU). It has a good mixture of hemo and then dips into combat. The real build you should go though however is [This](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tYt8t9t_t.t~ufuguhuivet-uaubucu2u3u4uquwyUuuuvu.uIuJuKuLuMuPuSuTuQuRuDuEuFuGu9uHuyuzuAuBu8tmtwtvujuxuC).  This provides you with the ability to PVP really well as well as do pickpocket runs for a lot of money at higher level. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask me.
---
Ring-around-the-rosie AB was my biggest pet peeve and the reason I went hard with premades in vanilla. Once you join a competent premade with a wait list, you never want to queue solo; Everyone listens or you're out next game. And once you're a regular (assuming you're good), room is made for you. Guild I was in had at least one premade queuing almost 24/7, pumping out HWLs.
---
ICC heroics were definitely harder than the other heroics at the relevant gear levels.
---
I'm actually starting to loss intrest. Just about the only thing we haven't seen in classic is raids and I'm hoping they don't test those publicly. I consumed to much and now I'm a lot less excited about classic coming out. They should have kept everything under NDA till like 30 days out. Not 90
---
Priest - no penance in classic :(
---
If you want I'd say start with assassination first and then take the 2/2 remorseless strikes. Then go into Sub and combat
---
haha that's the opposite!  low quality of life cos its boring!
---
fair!  for me druid is one of the most enjoyable and varied
---
"Can summ ?"
---
Lolno.
---
I am not sure you can validate a quest in raid.
---
At 5, you can but I am not certain for more.
---
Always played male for everything in wow except a human female rog alt once. That was just for the aesthetics since rogues are generally small and sleek. Love the big shoulder armor on the males.
---
Of course it will. Every guild will be greatly affected, in fact, many already have been.
---
Private server... Laaaaaame (I can tell by your key ring)
---
Build on top of AV, wsg and ab and allow flying combat with objectives like Harry Potter and keep ground combat in the same bg.
---
Penance and leap of faith
---
Improved Sinister Strike is better than 2% dodge and should probably be your first 2 talent points. With your suggested talents, you won't be getting a cheap combo point generator until level 40, and that's a ton of Sinister Strikes. Also if you are going that deep into Sublety take Preparation, it's amazing even in PvE.
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769737335
---
Nothing official, but it’s pretty well confirmed.
---
I feel like ppl might report a bug after such action :)
---
Rogue is a class that I'd also kinda want to give a more in-depht-try.
---
They seem increadibly fun in PvP. But it's hard to find 5-mans and solo-leveling them also doesn't seem overly exciting.
---
Warriors at least can take up the much thought-after role of tanking in 5-mans.
---
If you can play in a group, rogue is probably a lot more fun than solo. The 2nd warrior I leveled back then was with a friend who played a rogue. It was so much better for the both of us. I held aggro and was our ticket into instances, he stunned, backstabbed and killed very quickly so there was barely any downtimes.
---
BFD is the only one on Kalimdor, and you don't get a teleport there until 30.  Horde is huge difference because the two level 20 teleports take you to either of the continents.
---
When people start playing rogue in classic they are going to have to really adjust to moving slow in stealth and not having cloak.
---
I wouldn’t introduce it at all. 
---
It more or less killed world pvp and didn’t allow you to immerse and explore the world, like vanilla.
---
it's clearly an RPG. yall take it too far with that criticism, you don't like the game that's fine, but it's as much of an RPG as vanilla
---
what in retail stops it from being an RPG?
---
Shaman - when my windfury doesnt proc.
---
So why is 1% crit and AP Bis. I would think you want hit or agi
---
But you cant. Warmode, phasing in every little sub area of the game, almost no RPG elements left that force you into the open world. Teleports anywhere, flight masters everywhere. Nearly every class have some CC and speed increase that lets them run away to a different phase.
---
I cant believe after the Beta has been out for so long, people still fail to see how Classic is an actual RPG and BfA is not.
---
No advice, just fuckin do it, if it catches it catches.
---
Combat is much more better in vanilla but I'm a Subtlety fan just like you, you can have a look on my suggestion
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/A8\_FwQHABMPwP3Q](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/A8_FwQHABMPwP3Q) 
---
Having Preparation and Cold Blood I think is a huge combo, specially if you are going to play with daggers 2 crits from Ambush one after another it means huge dmg every 10 minutes xD (especially if you will find one opponent while lvl-ing)
---
Rogue - Everyone thinks im some greedy, ganking, self important asshole.
---
I mean they're right but it still hurts.
---
;)
---
Flying took out most of the World Travel, thus making the World fairly irrelevant. I can't disagree that it did deter immersion to some extent. I loved it and hated it. Perhaps with better limits on Flying, especially height, it'd hit a better blend of fun/immersion/usefulness. 
---
Personally I'm fine without it. I'd like to just leave it out. I very much enjoy, albeit forced on me, revisiting areas via ground mount. The travel time really isn't that bad anyways.
---
My hunter friends say that it's very worth it even in raids, only for Horde though I think because of WF. I'd guess raptor strike is often worth losing a part of autoshot  (if you time it well, you don't lose it all).
---
Wouldn't expect it to be a good idea when leveling, especially early on.
---
and warlocks with hellfire
---
&gt;People are saying they can reach rank 12/13 before patch 2 comes out in 2.5 months after release.
---
Do you mean phase 2? Honor system doesn't exist until phase 2.
---
If you were standing 1 for like 3-4 months in a row you'd be able to hit r14.
---
I believe people will hit r13 before phase 3 hits (bgs) but only on pvp servers and only if phase three takes 4 months to come out after phase 3.
---
The real tryhards are not even in this sub actually
---
yeah this is why im torn. pally at end game is just spamming flash of light, with a druid ill have more choices i think, but ill also miss out on a free mount
---
That makes sense. I usually only pop it when the healer has a mob on them and needs relief right away. Sheep is the first choice, but nova works if I already have one up.
---
I'm glad if this is helpful to others :)
---
If it's just alts I'd try and away him towards a druid. Jack of all trades and can fill any role/offrole in a group on the drop of a dime. 
---
But if he's hell bent on priest/war just flip a coin. Either way you're competing for gear although a warrior is more gear dependent.
---
nice
---
This is a death sentence in the \#NoChanges crowd, but toggleable BfA graphics would be an amazing feature. However shallow BfA is, the art and graphics design are wonderful.
---
Healers had pretty much infinite mana. Doing Stonecore Heroic with definitely *not* infinite mana was a real challenge. Early Cata was awesome.
---
Whats the thing behind delaying honorable kills to Phase 2 after probably 6-8 Months after release? IMO just weakens the wpvp feeling..ye you can have fun or annoying fights while leveling..but without the honorsystem its just some lvlingside thing without any accomplishments..
---
Why not implanting it right away? Gives much more thrill to the lvling process
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjSSFfX0EHk
---
Double Digit crit records incoming!
---
Sure. Because mana bombing a peaceful city is super cool.
---
&gt;Statistical analysis showed that although ***there was not a significant relationship between player personality traits and their class or faction selection***, there were significant relationships between personality traits and engagement in player versus player game play
---
from the abstract of the first, for those who didn't want to read.
---
&gt; We show that one can predict gender and age (within ±5 years) for 53% of players using machine learning and one can predict gender and age (within ±1 year) for over 11% of participants solely based on the features monitored by our systems. 
---
and the abstract of the second, which was based on character info including achievements, progression via armory, monitoring in-game locations over time, etc.
---
Why is this on /r/classicwow? This is a retail thing. Classic raiding is so time-consuming, the raids are not interesting enough to run multiple times per week even in the best cases, vanilla isn't particularly alt friendly, as well as the lock-out system being outright hostile to this approach.
---
During WoD, since there was basically no content EXCEPT raids, I ran three different raid schedules each week (a M/W team, a T/Th team, and a F team). BRF was really really dope that I could run it three times a week and not burn out on it - was a lot of fun, easily one of the all-time best raids.
---
Shaman if you count totems
---
Blizz, hire this person!
---
when you play bfa, you will feel overwhelmed with the amount of things that it offers, so its not a bad thing necessarily.   When you play classic, it will all seem simple and straight forward until you start getting into the upper levels then the game will become more meditative and thoughtful.  When i first started playing wow in 2005, i had no experience with MMOs so i didnt fully understand the purpose of the game but i still enjoyed playing it with my friends.  I would tell you to try a private server but that could taint your first experience so i would say to hold out til august.
---
Thanks a lot! I was always thinking that precision is top priority in every build. You didnt get Hemo, what you are using when in front? Gouge + Backstab? Sinister? 
---
Btw, you can use this site:  [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/) 
---
It is made to keep the order you get the talents and is meant for leveling guides :P
---
Will I main my main? 
---
Paladin: I don't generate enough threat to  be a proper tank.
---
I'm not interested in first lvl 60 or anything raiding-related. Only what I put on my edit.
---
His name kinda gives it away, I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt but.. .
---
Love mage. People think I’m some sort of vendor. At least pay for the things I can do for you. 
---
“Water pls” opens trade window immediately
---
Thats actually good too. Assassination early talents are very powerful :P
---
Prot warrior - hard to get into pvp.
---
There was an addon during vanilla where you pressed the hotkey, and a list of everyone in the party/raid would appear, sorted by furthest to closest. You clicked the name on the list and it would begin summoning them.
---
I just summoned from top to bottom. If they didn't want it, they could cancel.
---
&gt;Classic was so mesmerizing because we had to walk everywhere until level 40. And epics were only available at 60. This made you explore Azeroth, zone by zone and find its true beauty.
---
And how does that differ from flying? It's not like flying is available at level 10.
---
The problem with flying is that you cannot be interacted with. On a mount you can still be attacked, or buffed. Flying is basically a teleport.
---
&gt;I was planning on grinding for the Winterspring Frostsaber and a big part of the motivation is to show it off later (on reddit, YouTube...).
---
Do so. Why do you need official ingame tool? Reddit/YouTube/forum will show the date when you post your screenshot, people in IF will see you riding it, and a scam/photoshop attempt would be quite obvious...
---
It certainly killed all of it but flying mounts are so cool don’t you agree? I guess you have to choose one or the other. So no chances of immersion and flying coexisting on your end?
---
I am 36 and I still think Shockadin was the best.
---
I tried doing a Kara run in TBC with full on Shockadin once. I was able to keep up on meters but I was OOM every trash pull.
---
VC =Van Cleef, final boss in deadmines
---
Sorry, I took Firestone spec
---
Another thing was tank damage in WOTLK was god damn out of control. Algalon hit like two Brutallus' and it was possible to have a tank get globalled through with cooldowns active. I remember tanks stacking nothing but stamina, because nothing mattered until you could survive two hits back to back. WOTLK was a mess.
---
Again I apologize, I am not trying to be mean or negative. I'm trying to provide constructive criticism. 
---
&gt;When I said wanna feel like rogue, I mean being stealth that dont get caught from 5 meters away and dont move like a turtle while on it.
---
Yeah, basically all you need is MoD and Cam then. For anything besides Raiding, I recommend having those anyways. They're just great skills. 
---
The build you just linked, looks much better. That's pretty rad for general PvE. I'd even squeeze one more point into Ghostly Strike if you want it. Otherwise the rest of it should probably go into Assassination. Malice, Lethality, Improved Eviscerate, etc. 
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=rogue&amp;talents=tktRtmtwtvtdtFtGtHtItYt8t9t_t.t~ufuguhuititNtOtPtQvdtjtJtKtLtXtZt0t1t2JTJUC0C1C2tpveuIuJuKuLuMuUuVuWuP
---
It may not be super optimized like others probably desire, but I think that's a great and fun choice based off of what you linked considering you want to roll with those talents. Enjoy it fella!
---
I get people don't want changes but http://i.imgur.com/XV8igd6.jpg it just looks so good.
---
What are these decisions you talk about?
---
Won't this just mean good guilds require players to collect a few of the best world buffs directly before the raid starts? It's just gonna add even more prep time to already long raids...
---
Im doing this on Mobile so I didn't see hemo (lol)  let me use that then. Probably just give up the evis for it but lemme see
---
The weapons, armour, bosses, raids, community where all insane , i played since classic but dinged max level in BC, the BC grind to raiding was weird and I never got to indulge, but the grind on WotLK was nice and the community kept it flowing, the whole storyline was so fucking cool aswell
---
I think after that, Cata was literally too catastrophic, and MoP was gay as hell (with raids and instances that required no effort at all) so I quit. Legion was kinda cool tho I enjoyed raiding legion but realised it was just a race and eventually everyone would have the same gear , just depends who go it first (again though it was a faceroll)
---
Oh, you think the 4 minutes is a queue, you merely adopted the queue. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn’t see the game until I was level 40.
---
Or get into a guild and ask a guildie to craft your stuff for free.
---
Hunter - I hate my pet. He’s an asshole who rarely follows commands and loves purposely pulling additional trash.
---
Paladin- I have to play alliance in classic
---
Yep.
---
Ulduar was the highlight of wotlk.  Hardmode Mimiron almost killed our guild.
---
You pull, you tank
---
I may be thinking of TBC or something. I recall the Cost of Respec drops though... with X amount of days or just per Week. Memory is very fuzzy... 13 years ago man!
---
I like the first build a lot! and since I will probably play on pve server (unless friends decide otherwise), will be good for me. One question though, why is second build better for Pick Pocket runs? 3/3 Imp Sap? or shorter vanish cd? I am very interesting in pick pocket runs as well, just asking if I can make first build a little change for it.
---
Shaman. 
---
Totems are the reason they're my favorite in classic. Totems are also basically a buff that you have to apply every minute. Or every time you start a new pack.
---
Why are the lvl in "Zzz" ? Didn you find an inn where you can actually rest inside a dungeon ?
---
Whats the advantage of having 21 in resto over 31 in feral?
---
Thank you. Yeap I thought of it too (for sinister). About preparation, its a 10min cd... what difference can it make  (I will play on pve server btw).
---
It used to be customary to pay for a portal. (mat price + small tip)
---
For a simple example, in Vanilla you have to decide which abilities are worth buying since they cost so much money.
---
I am at the same point... I am feeling the hype go down a little bit because the "forbidden fruit" is not so forbidden anymore.  Although I still am pumped, compared to a few months ago it's definitely become less.
---
Hoping to get a bit more hyped nearer to the release (which will probably happen).
---
Hunters - Constantly being judged as a Huntard, and Constantly having to prove people wrong and absolutely decimate them in Duels on top of it. Boy oh boy did it give me the Fuel I needed to excel though. Butthats.
---
Dark souls 1 scratches my itch for classic more than retail wow lol
---
Once they get Classic alive and relatively bug free there's no reason they shouldn't keep legacy servers around in some form. They may have to perfect a means of copying characters from one server to another without exploits but it's a small hurdle to having the best of both worlds.
---
That was in Cataclysm or MoP. In Vanilla the aggression was mostly resource based, as far as I can tell. The Warsong Clan wanted lumber in Ashenvale, the Night Elves didn't like that.
---
The Stormpike invaded Frostwolf land for no adequately explored reason (mining, I guess?), the Frostwolves didn't like that.
---
Warlock - no threat reduction! Pretty sad to have to use valuable trinket slots or shitty gear for set bonuses for the tank to keep up.
---
Imagine believing that taking a meme spec would make any dungeon take 30 minutes longer.
---
lol it seems I was right with the release date ! :D
---
You get NS, basically an oh shit button instead of leader of the pack. Since this is a hybrid build your want that
---
Never go full huntard.
---
Classic is meant for huge nerds not sure why you think anyone else cares
---
+1 I love the way this guy presents the info, easily digestible
---
Cause you should laugh and move on..
---
I agree with you 100%. Flying was really cool and the mounts are awesome but at the same time the cons heavily outweighed the pros of having flying in game. It killed world pvp and even the community to some extent.
---
My thoughts of introducing flying would be to limit the height of which a player can actually fly at but even then it would still kill a lot of funs aspects in game. Maybe have flying mounts available with only ground speed and whenever you take a FP you mount your selected flyer and not the gryphon/bat?
---
what do you mean “Poor RP interest”with dwarf? thats a paradox
---
Can confirm, half italian half irish.  Beard looks like a ginger rolled in a bunch of ashes.    Grey, black BRIGHT orange...not attractive.
---
Fair enough not sure what the schedule is
---
I mean dude, the guy is asking for legit answers and all you can give is a vague "it just is"
---
Thanks dude. That's - almost - exactly my point.
---
I think Im lucky, all my friends and job mates want to play Alliance and Im like crazy to level up a dwarf holy pally, so good for me :P
---
The reflex to kick and blacklist may be there, but don't.  Always assume the dude is doing it accidentally.  Always assume the dude *wants* to complete the dungeon and is willing to be a team player, until he proves you wrong.  If he's an impatient guy and is doing it on purpose, let *him* reveal that.  Let *him* be the asshole.
---
A simple comment along the lines of, "Hey, let's be careful with the pulls here, this isn't retail... I'm not good enough to tank two pulls at the same time".  If the guy doesn't respect that, then you can just say, "hey man, I told you, I'm doing my best here... this dungeon is gonna take forever if we wipe a lot.  Trust me, patience is better."
---
If the dude ignores you, wipe until your gear is red, and then say, "sorry guys, my gear is broken.  I have to go repair it... by the time I get back we'll be dealing with respawns.  Guess this isn't our day."
---
The next time you consider grouping with the guy who does this, you say, "hey last time you were pretty aggressive on the pulls.  I'll invite you if you promise to let me pace the dungeon and do all the pulling and stay behind me." 
---
If you extend that offer and the guy screws up again, then maybe a "blacklist" is in order.  But if you ever talk about this guy to others, only report what you saw.  "He has a habit of pulling extra stuff, so be careful."
---
&gt;Undead are often associated with being played by angsty teens
---
I've never seen anyone mention this.
---
I've only ever seen a bias against blood/void elfves.
---
And Worgen deathknights.
---
MoP arenas were fun, but yeah, that was the last time I actually had fun playing arena.
---
And I'm basically a PvP/arena player. I LOVED TBC/LK arenas and I played 6 hours/day of those and I don't care about arena nowadays. That says something about the current state of wow
---
I'd simply use classic.wowhead.com or classicdb.ch for details. 
---
I understand your concerns, like, Felwood is technically 45+ but most of the quests require 50 and recommend 55... Especially for Alliance.
---
Luckily in classic we'll have the new UI, seeing how I'll be planning to tank I'll always have my healer focused. But I suggest healers tell their tanks to focus them and pay attention to their mana.
---
I like how your comment implies that they are not already healing, as if dps is an option for those classes.

It is kind of odd to me. They seem to reinvent the wheel every expansion on art assets. They could easily reuse a lot more of their already vast catalog of assets and still make great content. I wonder if it is a matter of the team not being able to fill that content with interesting stuff.
---
It’s just something that naturally starts up. All out brawl for bragging rights. No rules winner takes all. The thrill of one more kill.

Yeah I know. 1g is usually the price, some people even charged 2G for Darn.

---
I once asked for a 'health table' in a LFR and the entire raid had a hissy fit for like 20 minutes....
---
This is common thinking but false logic. Unless you are pulling more than one player away from an objective, it's not worth. You are just leaving the team fights in the hands of your teammates instead of influencing them yourself.
---
Based what i've noticed on the beta, bag drops are rare and you get quite a bit more of "trash drops" compared to private servers. Meaning unless you have a friend giving you bags, you are going to be in big troubles.
---
Atm i dont think 2 gathering professions is even worth it. For solo players, combos like skinning+leatherworking or enchanting+tailoring is a much, MUCH better idea. You can always change it after you get a mount.
---
Swifty
---
Sure mate.
---
I fail to see how your sex/gender choices have anything to do with World of Warcraft
---
Well I mean no offense, but when so far most of the upvoted responses are basically either literally "they can't" with no explanation or "well there are reasons" with no actual reasons, that REALLY doesn't count as them arguing.
---
I think his only argument is that a Paladin can literally spec for tanking and generate threat and keep mobs on them. The answer he is looking for is numbers and deep thought as to why they are completely unable to do so. 
---
In which, if those non answers are considered valid responses around here, omg rip this reddit.
---
I don't really suffer fools easily like that. If he pulls I ask him to stop. If he body pulls its an accident most likely. But a hunter flat out arcane shot pulling a group to the right when I am marking a group to the left then I tell him to stop doing that. If he doesn't listen then I kick and give him a whisper telling him why. I don't want to spend two gold on repair bills to get an idiot to listen.
---
I logged on BFA for 9 minutes on friday night after work.  Thats all it took to refresh my memory after 8 months of not playing
---
Sorry for the ambiguity, what I meant to say was I don't have any interest in the RP that usually goes with Holy Priests
---
yea man no worries and you didnt sound mean :P Thanks for taking the time to answer. Already offered with many good builds so far, yours included!
---
Don't think it is generally worth to be bothered on lower levels. 
---
I've been discussing this topic in raid environment around 1 year ago, and my point was that melee weaving is more of a funky gimmick you can use under certain conditions, not a general part of your rotation. Back then nobody managed to provide logs or any proof that consistently weaving hunters perform better than the ones who do that occasionally if ever. 
---
And it does make sense up to a certain point, since quite often there are boss mechanics like fires, cleaves, explosions, stuns you can just avoid by keeping distance, since the chances are that you will mess up your whole rotation and lose DPS when trying to weave on every occasion.
---
same
---
“I didn’t think I would, but I am”
---
That's a good point. I didn't even think of that.
---
Oh wow.
---
I actually never asked/gave more than 40 silver or something.
---
&gt; I guess they eventually realized balancing the entire game around something that ~0.5% of the population participated in was kind of stupid.
---
And yet here we are back at vanilla/naxx era instead of LFRs :)
---
Paladin - no crusader strike. RIP
---
Sad because Legion was an awsome expansion. With some problems, by really solid xpac.
---
&gt; They should have balanced Arena and PvE separately.
---
They do that now, and PvP is as boring as ever
---
what professions are you planning for shaman, anything other than the classic mining/engi?
---
I mean, cool. I'm not interested in anything you put in your OP, nor are "achievements". I don't know who would even care to see those anyways, besides the people striving for it. They're quite meaningless to most. I'm sorry it deters your will to play a game, but at the same time I'm glad. I don't value "achievement awards" at all, and never will. That was just put in by Blizzard to keep players busy and playing their dying Retail game. If not having Achievements hurts you that bad, then I highly recommend you do not play Classic. At the same time, I think you should at least give it a try. It's uhh... very different from Retail, in mostly good ways.
---
Sidenote; Don't let the downvotes bother you. Even GOOD posts get a lot of those. There are just hateful trolls and an army of bots out there, being jerks.
---
It was the case on the big pservers. Makes sense to me at least.
---
Get ready to go back to town and LFM a new DPS then.
---
Funny people still think of Vanilla raids as a one and only endgame, when MANY players could get 1 years worth of gameplay out of leveling + gearing up fully in dungeons.
---
I mean shit, some people back when Vanilla was live were not able to get a full t0 set before TBC because of bad luck. 
---
T0.5 was a legit endgame for MANY players.
---
If you raid Mythic in Retail, Classic WoW will not scratch that itch. It simply won't. People who quit early on in WoW's life don't "get" how challenging the content has become (in a good way). 
---
40-man raiding "worked" in Vanilla because the content was so baby-easy that a lot of players who really shouldn't be getting epic rewards got them just for showing up and playing politics. But it's not going to offer that level of personal challenge someone who plays modern WoW will be seeking.
---
Well, they have Mythic+ tournaments now
---
&gt;But think they don't take in new ones, and manly keep the ones they have already.
---
That's true.
---
Actually doesn't sound so weird to me, even more accurate. The dungeon is Blackrock Spire, and then you have upper or lower. I think it works.
---
I’m not allowed to mention that I don’t like part of the lore and cannon? Okay, sorry mom. Didn’t know I wasn’t allowed to talk about my opinion in public.
---
Isn't a hemo build better with swords or maces? (noob rogue here)
---
The only thing in common with all of your life failures is you.
---
I agree on it being Shaman.
---
But how do longer cast times leave less room for error? I always feel like shamans and paladins are healing something and the priest gets the heal out faster, making the shaman/paladin heal go into overhealing.
---
You might get in for stress test. If they are going to up the limit.
---
No. The world doesn't change. Your character, your choices have no impact on story at all. And as I said, as long as it's not RP server, you have no role play at all, because you are not /s or /w to other players in a way your character would. And considering vanilla where base stats did matter, you are not taking Tauren and role playing his 15 intelligance, do you? Unless you are a shitty player that stands in the fire, then maybe yes, you do play like lowest base int character.
---
My main has been a Mage since Vanilla.  For this classic my main will be a mage.  Play what you like who cares about the rest.
---
Cower?
---
The why for many people can be just for the challenge of it. I plan on taking Shaman tanking as far as I can. Because I already played Vanilla straight before, I see no reason to just repeat tryharding.
---
Well, you just have bad taste in games so there's not much we can do about that can we
---
Its worse now though with the enemy scaling system. Mobs you just fought a level ago get stronger as you level up. Their is no sense of progression going from 110 to 120 as the world levels up with you so you don't feel stronger when leveling. A lvl 110 character is better at clearing trash in a 120 dungeon than a fresh 120, which is amazing and a way people used to escape leveling.
---
World scaling was a huge mistake.
---
I remember back in cata I was in a group that was rushing heroics on day 2-3 and we would double heal some instances simply because the damage the tank would take was enough to make a single healer cry. The runs were slow, but we got them done and learned the fights and by the end of the week were one of the best geared groups. Was a TON of fun having to struggle and learn the fights and sometimes cheese certain instances with double healer.
---
yeah pretty sure my guild 1/2 CoS Mythic will struggle to defeat the roster boss when classic drops.
---
I was Druid in Vanilla and last 5-6 years of retail. 
---
For classic I like druid but am tempted to go Rogue or Priest as a new experience.
---
Druid is more fun but paladin is a safer option. You can always bubble, you have rez, you have heals, you have blessing of might, devotion aura.
---
What you don’t have is an engaging combat system. Prepare for seal of righteousness and auto attacks!

It really is just one of those pointless threads man.

You can easily prioritise buying bags while you level and be fine for bag spavce

on my drood i tanked+healed pretty much all the way to 60.  if you're playing with friends who are decent you can clear most &lt;60 dungeons pretty comfortably

Yeah a way to trade gold cross faction was to post something on the goblin AH for a certain price, say 100g and then the opposite faction will buy it and you would get 100g minus the AH cut.
---
No idea about that, but either way it's definitely not right before BC, at the very earliest it's right before wrath.

Something like this is probably fine. U gotta take talents with a pinch of salt. You will have to change some  depending if your ahead of the curve or you're in the zerg (if you're ahead  or you're behind)
---
Rep your class coward!
---
^^^^RET ^^^^SUCK ^^^^LOL
---
It's fine with me, i'd rather go 4 man than wipe constantly.
---
It's true, vanilla Rogue is absolutely busted.  
---
But I promise you, the experience does count for something :)
---
Yes, but it's not great outside of pvp (prep/cb/hemo). For levelling the only reason you'd go Sub is for Ambush/daggers, as hemo is just a straight downgrade of being combat as you're still wanting to use slow MH not a dagger.
---
Except more people were subscribed to vanilla than are subscribed to BfA.
---
That fucks everyone else in the group over though. Just let them die.
---
I'm going to try not leaving the first starting zone until my gathering is high enough for the next zone. It sucks so bad when I'm not strong enough to pick flowers.
---
Oh, I really don't care about achievements either, trust me. I just wanted a way to show I got the tiger legitimately, so people don't say it's a private server or some other fake claim, as it's a HUGE task to get one. So just for once I would like something I do... "recorded" as a proof. While everyone was doing achievements (when they were out) when I played WoW, I just did quests, collected fun items, goofed around. I had like the lowest achievement score of anyone in my guild (although small guild).
---
In vanilla, it seemed like undead rogues were the angsty teens.
---
Uh, if it's super obvious that the guy is causing wipes by pulling while the masochist group lead refuses to kick *and* tries to keep going until the whole group is in red, that group lead is probably gonna end up in a blacklist or three.
---
&gt;Why would you personally recommend Classic to someone?
---
If you have fuck all going on in your life and need a hobby to waste a ton of your time on, and don't care about that hobby mostly involving sitting still in front of a PC. Then sure, WoW will suit you just fine.
---
I played retail vanilla wow which had way more players than this will. They have the capabilities to do this right without layering. They just want to cut costs as much as possible. Also, private servers are able to handle 10k players at once. Blizz can easily have many servers of 5k with no layering.
---
ah ok, yeah i would hit a single macro button 4 times in BC

Saying "I know they CAN do it" isn't knowing the answer. He is trying to say he knows that it is possible, and wants to know why it is not probable. 
---
There are a FEW valid reaponses, which he thanked people for and took. There are MANY shitty responses that state exactly what I said, which got upvoted, and all the OP asked was "explain" and they never did.
---
You can tell someone to google something, that is a legit answer. Giving a non answer then taunting someone who not liking a non answer is pretty much being a douche.

Can't wait to hold a meet and greet for alliance and horde alike in the middle of Hillsbrad.
---
He... he... he...
---
I wasn’t taunting him. I wasn’t even replying to him. I replied to someone else in this thread. Fuck off “douche”
---
My fear is the people who will keep crying for more raid DPS even if the gap is only like 20% (which is fine to me). If you buff them once, why not again if they are still behind? Since the beginning of WoW people were crying for another class being superior even if they have the 2nd best out of them all.
---
It isn't an easy task as a dev. to see what is bitching about other classes and what's progressive feedback.
---
What an angsty teen would play if not undead? Undead are evil, opposed to the wholr world and are good gankers.
---
Since like 50% of Horde are undead, this stereotype is of course wrong, and there're bunch of decent adults playing this race.
---
These are amazing! Great job dude

---
You were missing out on prep as well as imp sap and shorter vanish yeah. They are really good for pvp and for pve pick pocket because it allows you to mess up more. The fact that you have cold blood as well you can build up combo points really fast and then Cold Blood eviscerate mobs to effectively kill them so you can start on the 2nd target once the sap breaks. Generally it is so you have time to heal between elites.
---
My buddy and I used to call his mum to get her to log us in to queue before we got home from school to avoid queues. Ain't no shame in that.
---
They were very fun, but it still blows my mind how people complained so much about that. I think it was at that point I realized that WoW's new audience has completely changed at that point and it should've been a hint that the old school ways would no longer be catered to.
---
Honestly people who resubbed just to try to get into beta, shouldnt get into beta.
---
Oh yes, definitely! I am so jealous that you will get to experience the greatest years of WoW without knowing what is around the corner. Go for it but dont look too much at guides, strategies or anything. Just pick a class, enjoy the ride and discover what the world has to offer. Oh damn im relaly jealous man.
---
I’m positive you didn’t travel through all zones from your 1-60 leveling experience. Once you get a mount you can blast through all zones. That’s why blizz never allowed flying at the early stages of new xpans 
---
Azeroth is huge and when you allow flying it greatly reduces the world since you’re able to travel around so easily. “Cherry picking” nodes/herbs/mobs/players, etc. It removes the immersion of the world by not traveling on and off roads and player to player contact. Players can only attack or buff if you’re in certain range.
---
So back to my question, would you not reintroduce flying at all? Or would you reintroduce it with limits?
---
Honestly I don't have any memory of there being a problem of DPS chain pulling, I mean yeah it probably happened a handful of times but those dps soon learned. Now in retail its basically a fucking race to see who can pull faster among dps, shits cancerous.
---
They should both admit they've messed something up along the way with retail, and conversely that classic is dated and flawed - and then just release a completely new MMO with the lessons learned from both.
---
I'm excited for classic, but I know it will not be the same pure joy as the first time. After all, I've done it all before once already.
---
Awesome work! IMO Wailing Caverns is the standout.
---
Works like a charm as a healer. When I'm tanking, the healers can't seem to resist the urge to heal the guy pulling, and I end up having to pull the mob off of the healer.
---
i thought it was green...i'll have to log into my tailor in classic when i get out of work and ill let you know later
---
Imo its not worth taking a crafting proff to make your own gear.
---
The margins on a single piece are not large at all, and as you are only bothered with making gear for urself as you level you only need s few items.
---
If you are levelling LW to,say, 200 to craft a single item, you should not only consider the mat costs in isolation (as other ppl who say its cheaper are doing) you should also factor in the cost of levelling the skill to allow you to craft this item. Once you factor this in its completely not worth.
---
Imo only take a crafting profession if you plan to focus on it for money and hsve a plan on whst items you will be selling
---
My plan is to steal a 3000 rig from this guy I’ve heard of who’s gonna be on vacation, and then play on launch day
---
I remember in Legion there was some weird thing with scaling where you'd end up with higher DPS at lower levels than later ones while leveling.
---
I think *world* scaling overall is good for modern WoW but I don't know why they put that into *expansions*.
---
Neck may just be one of those slots that doesn't have a good hit chance item pre-raid. Of course agi is good, if there was a 20agi neck or something I assume it'd be BIS instead of this.
---
Your list means nothing until you also put honest weights to each point :)
---
Awesome work!
---
Oh I see! Thanks for the info!
---
Try it yourself. Smite gives an absorbtion effect so you can literally spam it for days.
---
:D love it!
---
Priest: Starshards is trash.
---
Nah. The mental retardation of streamers and layering has killed my hope for Classic.
---
Time will tell..
---
Druid - Having to carry around and constantly swapping back and forth a lot of gear for different purposes.
---
Looks like he found a blue leather headpiece that kept him going strong.
---
Apologies, I didn't mean it to sound like you're trying to deceive people, you just make it sound like level 55 water is trainable from the vendor once you reach that level which is why I said what I did.
---
Anything close to 100% flying breaks world travel immensely because you have no reason at all to be near the ground, with 60% it's pretty decent balance. 
---
Secondary something has to be done about pvp, both in terms of sneaking up to people with flying, hovering atop of them waiting for the to be vulnerable, and escaping pvp with flying. Definitely some sort of dismounting ability needs to be in the game.
---
While I agree that sounds reasonable I think they'll speed up the first phase a little. Partly because of fast levelers but mainly due to the PvP
---
or use /world
---
Your best bet is to go what u feel like is good. Thats something I'd do if I was sub but I'm.going combat... Might not do a rogue as they are kinda crappy solo lvling. Might take the high road and go Mage and just kite like 30 mobs with frost nova and blizzard (because that's not balanced at all)
---
Keep changing it tho. I might just spend hours of theory crafting
---
Blizzard even told people to NOT sub to get a chance for classic as that's pretty much not going to happen.
---
I used to do this as a mage.  Works well until the whole team focuses you whenever you come near.  Then they just seat you like a fly, and you become a minor inconvenience.
---
Then I went 3-minute mage.  If I'm only going to last a few seconds in combat, might as well make them count for something.  I watched my ignite procs kill many flag carriers from beyond the grave.
---
Only to get picked up immediately by their teammate, because there was no one else there to assist me.  Of course, it did work out much better in premades.  It's only really bad without communication.
---
I mained Warlock and loved it. But now I'm rolling hunter.
---
Almost the same experience, but not quite.
---
I raided with a guild durring... WoD? I think it was that had a guy like this. He had already cleared *some* heroic content and had loot, came back to help us plebians attempt normals for the first time. Would constantly complain when people messed shit up, took too long to do anything. "Common guys I could be pushing heroic right now instead of waiting!" Yet at the same time, paradoxically, would ninja afk in the middle of attempts only to come back 10-20mins later saying "sory sory weed break, you know how it is."
---
This guy? You know it, real life friend of the guild leader. I dropped that guild so hard.
---
Even the "lel so random xd" kids could play vanilla wow. They wouldn't be good at it, but plenty of dumb 8 year olds managed to have fun with it.  
---
They might just spend most of their time ganking lowbies or farming gold, but gatekeeping people, because they aren't capable of beating endgame content is fucking stupid.
---
like I said, unnatural
---
I'm sorry you feel that way. My list means something to me as it helped me finally make a decision, but I appreciate that not every human will gain much value from it. The point really was to give those others who can't decide a possible way to help narrow things down
---
&gt;Horde players are generally more friendly, less elitist and more outgoing than Alliance (based on the experiences of a pure-bred Alliance player)
---
The grass is always greener on the other side...
---
[laughs in Windfury]
---
Jokes aside Enh Shaman is actually tight
---
So, better players who want to optimize rather than loot eaters? Sounds good.
---
Stating that silly and cartoonish characters don't suit world of warcraft makes no sense unless you are only looking at WC 1. Stating you have an issue with the cannon and the lore separates them and would make one assume you yourself are separating them, you are all good to dislike the lore but then stating canon as separate issue I ain't gonna presume you mean the lore again but rather the inconsistency with the cannon like they had in TBC and Legion. 
---
Oh and you are allowed your opinion, and I can state your opinion is stupid given the justification you give makes no sense apart from not liking the aesthetic or kung fu panda, which is a valid reason for not liking something.
---
I leveled 2 characters to level cap in BFA and haven't done a single dungeon this expansion.
---
Really not that bad, you get gold and other drops while you’re doing it so it’s not like you’re wasting your time.
---
So you are.... aggreeing with me?
---
Jesus man settle down it’s a fucking joke.

Actually... Cataclysm HC's were even harder then TBC-HC's and got nerfed within 2 Weeks.
---
atleast you'd get better gear than the enemy quicker...
---
Very good point
---
Is very easy to counter a mage, there is a potion called "free action potion" you drink it before attacking the mage and the mage is dead because he can't slow you but you can slow him. A mage vs a rogue or a warrior with free action potion up (30 seconds) is a dead mage, you can't do nothing, maybe use 2 ices blocks (20 seconds ) but then you are without cds while he have all.
---
One thing i realised today while doing the quest to unlock the dark iron dwarves, Moira sends you to brd, molten core, firelands, then back to brd, heading back to stormwind after each place, and she just portals you there and mole machine back. You technically dont even leave stormwind. Its just a load screen to what is essentially a scenario, then load screen back to sw.. in vanilla they would have walk there and back yourself.
---
So going by your edit you seem to want to do these things for epeen and boasting/showing off, that's fair and all I ain't gonna judge you for it but maybe Classic won't be for you.
---
I played from the end of classic to the start of cata, i quit like a few weeks into cata and i must agree, WolK was probably the peak for me, cata just...felt bad? no way to really explain it honestly. WoLk was soo good, got me heavy into pvp, raiding, doing hardcore Icecrown trying to be the server first to down the lich king.
---
Id go back to Wolk in heart beat if it was ever offered to us on a server. 
---
I do hope however that blizz will slowly worth their way through patches and all the way up to WoLk
---
It is worth it. You gain damage if you do it correct. Keep in mind on real blizzard server the mobs will be slower in the starting zone and you want to tag as many mobs as possible anyway in a real server scenario (competition is tight).  My leveling includes this for 1-6 and then I start doing it again when I have my pet, works better with a 2handed weapon.  You bascially trade your characters HP for extra dmg at that point.  
---
Combat log example from stresstest (lvl 10 - pet tanking mob + player facetanking mob) using a 2handed weapon:
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/htwyDRR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/htwyDRR.jpg) 
---
See I trade my hp to gain big melee dmg on top of my range dmg. Just gotta be carefull to not die haha.
---
with 2x shammys you have that great pocket heal aswell. never underestimate a 1.5sec heal
---
&gt; warriors rolling on rogue gear.
---
This one is a bit different because that gear is pre-MC BIS for Warriors, Rogues, and sometimes Hunters too. If it's equally the best for everyone I don't think it's fair to categorize it as "Rogue gear" just because it's leather. In fact, some of that stuff will last the longest on Warriors because their tier sets generally don't give them DPS stats.
---
&gt;Yes I know I know they were there in the warcraft game but who the fuck even paid attention to those few characters
---
Certainly every DotA player. You can't just ignore Brewmaster or Storm Spirit.
---
Laughs in frostmage. Laughs vanish. Laughs in feighnt death. Pull faster you meatshield

---
Flying is a difficult thing. It's been like this in all games that had flying. Recently in Anthem, before that most notably to me Aion. Flying is just a means to be FASTER. It doesn't even matter what for. 
---
Faster farming. Faster to get from A to B. Faster ganking. Faster this, faster that.
---
FASTER is simply not the greatest thing for any MMO
---
Leatherworking is one of the worst professions available, but people still level it for some reason.
---
So yes, let those people craft for you while you provide the mats :)
---
I think it's hilarious.
---
This why my guild always brought one ret pally into raids. If your dps was lower than the pally you got an instant /gkick
---
My main was an orc rogue named Whofarted. So no.
---
but switching in raid is not possible, you will have to go to your main city and respec there, which costs an increasing amount of gold (up to 50g max) which in classic is like a few days worth of farming
---
Again, thats now the levels for that zone. Thats the levels for Joana's specific route through that zone.
---
Let me give you an example. Lets imagine a zone has 100 quests, of which 20 are for 40-41 and 80 are for 42-44. If Joana only goes into that zone for a quick 40-41 before going somewhere else, the guide will say "Zone: 40-41", even though there's plenty of 42-44 content there.
---
&gt;my guild gave up AQ40 to work on Naxx 
---
This is why it couldn't clear Naxx :P Make sure to convince your guild to not give up *gearing* this time around.
---
For timeline, no one knows atm.
---
Didn’t they just say that it isn’t guaranteed you would get in? I’m pretty sure that they didn’t say “don’t sub to our game”
---
It's not so much the chain pulling that was the problem in Vanilla, it was body pulling pats.  And as a Hunter, if I did it, it was because I was trying to get to 8 yards so I could DPS.
---
Didn't really make them though did you? Just found fonts online and typed in a word. This reddit is becoming more and more like a special needs centre as the day goes by. "Huhuhuh omg amazing logos dude huhuhuh"
---
The ZG patterns require tailoring for the set bonus
---
Well bad news classic has that too
---
I will make them understand. Frostmourne hungers.
---
I agree with the sentiment here - I think you give a longer leash than I would, but the point is still valid. If you go around insta-kicking everyone you're going to end up having a hard time finding a group yourself
---
The other thing to keep in mind is that the folks on this sub are a small minority of the folks that will be playing - which is to say that it's very likely that there will be a learning curve for most folks on what it takes to run these dungeons! (i.e. - let the tank pull because they cannot instantly grab threat on 5 mobs, focus the skull since the tank can't hold threat on 5 mobs at once, let the healer drink since mana doesn't instantly regenerate, etc.)
---
A little patience goes a long way in these scenarios, since many of the folks that make these mistakes will likely be making honest mistakes.
---
I was doing such a good job of not getting excited.  Time was flowing normally, I wasn't paying any attention to Classic.
---
Then a few weeks ago my friends were asking what class I was going to play.  I defaulted to the Priest answer I've been falling back on to make them be quiet.  Then I thought about it more, got myself a little excited to play Rogue.  After that, I had to figure out what race to run.  Onto Youtube to look at the race/class combo comparisons.  Then it went into Professions, so I started watching videos comparing those, too.  The past couple of weeks have felt like months.  How did I let myself fall into the hype with a whole 2.5 months to go??  I don't know how I'm going to make it.
---
It will be. I prefer classic over current version.
---
There are already sites for raid speedrun which will be available for classic for sure.
---
Regarding leveling there's this [Barrens Chat thread](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?t=904) and multiple Discord server dedicated to the topic.
---
YEP.
---
Yup. Only thousands of streamers were allowed in.
---
You should contact their support and let them know that you are one of the few million people with such an old account that should have been given beta access. 
---
Dungeon finder, with no guildies/friends.
---
BFA has amazing endgame content, mythic plus is one of the best inventions Blizzard have created for the modern game, but people think endgame is just being 120...
---
This same person is going to hit 60 after 3 months and cry that they cant get into a group in full greens as a elemental shaman.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**What we currently interested in:**
---
\- Top of the line Protection Warrior
---
\- Experienced Lua Coder
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
​**Intended raid/play times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings (CET Timezone). More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
**Aditional info:**
---
\- While the guild will be very active on the PvP scene, &lt;Hate&gt; will remain a raiding guild at it’s core. 
---
\- Regarding the loot system, we intend to implement our own DKP system, however Loot Council is still not off the table yet. 
---
**Bottom line:**
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/) ​ or check our Discord here [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK ](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
​P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al-HuOkpVhA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al-HuOkpVhA)
---
I will when I figure it out.
---
Don't kick them, wait for them to pull, do nothing until they're dead, then start tanking them and kill the pack with the rest of the group. If the healer feels generous, he can get a res, if not, he walks. Repeat until he won't try that shit again. Shouldn't take too long.
---
It's crazy that there was no other way to do another expansion because everyone was so OP lat in WOTLK. That's why I feel that no game should every get that many expansion or last 15 years, and it's best to just start fresh again.
---
Vanilla was so great in the beginning because 75% of the game was your journey from 1-60. Then the game started focusing on endgame and PVP, which were awesome additions at the time. And even though those elements were refined and improved in TBC and some of WOTLK, the journey started to disappear. Now the game is nothing but endgame Dungeons &amp; Raids along with every possible convenience imaginable where players stand in the main city and Que up for everything. The world is no longer relevant and the overall focus has lost touch with what made it great.
---
I had a /castsequence macro for 4 totems behind one button in TBC, made a couple different ones and use them depending on group composition, boss fight etc. Not sure if /castsequence is supported in vanilla or classic beta.
---
Don't worry. The chance of me getting in is slim to none. But I would do my best to stress-test and report bugs. Would be lovely to get that dose of nostalgia again, even if short-lived.
---
&gt; as it's very very simple and new player friendly.
---
Classic is more new player friendly than BfA. It really is (mostly because BfA is absolutely awful in that regard). In BfA you have to spend some 50+ hours levelling in a meaningless arbitrary way (do one and a half zone from each expansion, then being thrown off into the next) before you can actually play the real game. Or you use a character boost and you are completely overwhelmed by suddenly having 30+ spells on your bars. 
---
Only problem with classic is if you're only used to more modern games in the same genre, then a lot of things in classic can feel terrible, because you're used to newer more streamlined systems. 
---
But as a new player classic is much easier to get into than BfA. Levelling is actually designed to let new players get into the game (in BfA levelling is designed to make it bearable for existing players levelling alts).
---
i played vanilla. had a AV exhautled 60 rogue, 53 druid, and some 40 mages/warlockss. had a full epiced 60 undead priest shadow as well.
---
played a little of tbc.
---
played lots of private vanilla servers for years.
---
u couldnt be more wrong
---
Not scaling at end game, and for some reason the best ranged weapon in the game adds almost no DPS compared to the pre-MC BiS blue weapon. :(
---
Why do I feel bad when I miss a simple dungeon run with friends, hating the thought of missing out on a new inside joke or fun experience, yet I can't talk to that cute girl who could give me an entire new world of experiences?
---
That's a race problem tho :p
---
lolwut
---
U keep going until your shit is broken and you still keep being polite to the guy? What in the actual f
---
Wrong
---
I usually pm the healer with something like "if he keeps pulling let him die"
---
Literally a vanilla feature you brainlet.
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
Probably for the same reason people were upset with Luclin -&gt; Planes of Power expac for EverQuest (glaring bugs aside).
---
I mean, you essentially so the exact same in vanilla, but instead of smite you wand, you PW:S and Renew yourself and wand away.
---
I can think of:
---
Pop something and shift back. 
---
Stop casting. 
---
Not Innervate if target is a rogue/warrior/mage/warlock/hunter/paladin :D
---
So true
---
Use it on passive and problem solved
---

Man I feel like classic is the best starting stone. I do remember bc+wrath being the best time for those who liked raiding. It was a perfect mix, then they pre cata patched 10-25 man raids into one and it died from there.
---
I support this plan.
---
Plot twist: The left head and the right head are one and the same! (JK ok? Don't get offended my dear sub comrades)
---
totaly agree with you. and thats where the devs come in.
---
as a rule of thumb a support class should do about as much dps as an pure dps INCLUDING the damage buff it provieds the group.
---
For example (placeholder values) an Enhance shaman increases the average melee group by 5% for each class 4x5 =20%
---
so the maximum dps this supporter should do is 80% of a furry/rogue.
---
i know that is a over simpliefied calculation but there has to be a maximum and thats a start on the brainstorming.
---
if the reasom behind an change is presented, people are far more likely to agree and accept it.
---
Have you never played with a guild? A group of friends?
---
It’s not false logic, you simply disagree.
---
Making a 1 for 1 situation that is a fair trade for your team isn’t a faulty strategy. It ultimately depends on your class’ strengths versus your opponent’s.
---
Mages seem more popular than even warriors, and with warriors the class is at least split in two between tank and DPS warriors.
---
Warrior, not even rudimentary self heal.
---
I think a lot of  the people who played it back at launch, and are playing this casually now, are going to be playing the same class for nostalgia.
---
I am in that boat, if i can get my old account back i will maybe login to retail just to see what my characters and what they had for nostalgia sake, provided everything hasn't been vendored
---
For having tried this 8.2 content on the PTR, i can say BFA will be in a much better state than it used to. Well outside of M+ since we traded a braindead affix for an annoying one.
---
So why not ? WoD was the worst so far yet people came back for legion.
---
I doubt we'll reach legion peak period this expansion but 8.2 will atry to address some of the greatest issues in BFA. It won't be a dead on arrival patch.
---
Basically anything less than 70s at max level for a portal is a waste of your time, considering you have to wait, meet up, pay for reagents, invite to group, etc.
---
IDK I'm just trying to spread accurate info.
---
Interesting tidbit on gnomes.. Their swimming occurs in more shallow water.  This knocks gnomes off their mount when jumping rivers other races can clear.
---
There is an iconic spot in Hillsbrad where it's been demonstrated.
---
Agreed. You’ll get bored faster.
---
For the smallest portion of the game when you think about it
---
True, people just want their dopamine hit and they want it now. Compared to wanting to earn and fight for a rewards which is a much better feeling of accomplishment. The newer crowd seems to forget that old WoW TBC/Vanilla wasn't about the destination, it was about the journey.
---
I resubbed when the news broke and got in on the first EU wave. Whatchu gon' do 'bout it? ;3;3
---
I honestly think its better to not get into beta. Having to restart and do it all over sounds like it would take all the nostalgia out of the release.
---
ICC heroics were the hardest heroics when at the relevant gear levels. Those heroics were specifically made harder in comparison to release heroics because of how easy release wrath heroics were.
---
Cancels use up a shard, though, right?
---
Lol need to have him turned the other way running. You never run towards that thing
---
Many of those early days accounts have been banned, either from botting, hacking, sold (which is not allowed and Blizzard bans them when they find out), or even buying/selling gold.
---
Rest in peace recovering from the biggest mistake in your WoW career, Classic will cure all that cancerous brain cells from that dinging 120.
---
It was. Its just like vanilla
---
I don't doubt you'll try it but everything you've written suggests you didn't play Vanilla and don't play pservers so much of that seems to be an assumption based on others hype. I sincerely hope I'm wrong and you end up falling in love with classic but it's a different beast from what you seem used to and are expecting/hoping.
---
ShadowPriest - when the face doesnt melt but only smolders... and the 100wispers a day if i want to heal x/y and answer with no ty. And then get some condisending speech about healing... from an arms war...
---
I'd you're playing trash, tourist-mode content. Sure, that's exactly what you're going to get.
---
Perform well in a mythic +? Or play in a guild? Your going to have people whisper you for dungeon invites constantly.
---
People issues with retail being 'unsocial' are just them being too stupid to realise they're playing content that people dont take seriously.
---
I don't like it that much, it doesn't fit the WoW theme at all in my opinion.
---
1g was standard price for ports in vanilla on my server.
---
My holiday application for the release week just got approved.
---
On mobile. No upvote left. Am confused
---
&gt; as a rule of thumb a support class should do about as much dps as an pure dps INCLUDING the damage buff it provieds the group. For example (placeholder values) an Enhance shaman increases the average melee group by 5% for each class 4x5 =20% so the maximum dps this supporter should do is 80% of a furry/rogue. &lt; 
---
100% agreed, that's how it should be done.
---
If your average Joe is able to do maths instead of watching a flashy DPS Meter, is an other discussion, but you are right.
---
Shaman - enhance and elemental are not really viable...but that’s true of most classes other specs
---
You don't need dungeon finder.. you just have to join the proper chat channels 😀
---
There are 2 versions of WoW, and you've already said you will not be trying the other one first.  You've already answered your own question before any of us even read it.
---
Don't need a level increase to run DM, it's already available.
---
Hi, /u/samp_90
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1navr/paladin_or_druid/). 
---
I know, personally I wouldn't care, but blizzard would still have to cater to the people who don't have time to spend finding groups
---
mage - most of your gear looks retarded (hello ugly dresses and bloodvine), and gnome mage is one of my least favorite aesthetics in the whole game
---
I’m getting serious Crash Bandicoot vibes here.
---
Maybe the instance portals should be those round ones as well!
---
Yeah... this is the same guy who said that Mortal Strike was a waste of a talent point in level 40 PvP.
---
Paladin complement a Warrior way better in terms of gameplay. I mean, freedom, dispels, everything you'll ever need.
---
Assuming the pally/druid will be healers of course. If you plan is to DPS, then a druid would be better simply for the fact that you won't compete for gear.
---
I really wonder how you came up with this as the ICC HC's were straight up harder than the other HC's in WOTLK, which, just like its early raids, got absolutely stomped on days after release.
---
Flying and immersion can coexist when flying is part of the normal game.
---
Like in a space-combat-simulator.
---
But in WoW, which basically is about fighting with magic and medieval weapons, you can't do anything when you fly except for moving around.
---
I mean there actually are some encounters where you do stuff while flying. I remember having to pick red, yellow or green dragons with different purposes. But this made it irrelevant what your class was and showed that wow's engine is not really suitable to navigate in 3 dimensions.
---
So I'd leave it out of WoW but would say it can be immersive in a game that was designed all around it... Like Eve Online, for example.
---
Do you really think queuing for a random dungeon while leveling is how you’re gonna experience endgame? You’re actually a fucking idiot
---
Two reasons
---
1. If a classic is coming now, why would you play somewhere else only to abandon your progress once classic comes out?
---
2. People played on private servers because there was no official stuff. With official coming out, many people lost interest in private.
---
3. Private servers have bugs, issues, drama, paywalls etc. 
---
4. This subreddit is to discuss Classic specifically. Even the rules say no discussion of P servers.
---
I’ve played alot of vanilla/bc/wrath pservers but im tired or the 1.12 client tbh its so stuttery and bad by todays standard, and after feeling how smooth and enjoyable the classic client is i’ll gladly wait instead.
---
Nice.
---
There are no neck with hit and/or agi, at least not enough of it to be better than that neck. 
---
Most of the alternatives to the above mentioned neck has stamina and AP, which is obviously worse in a PvE setting.
---
I feel like warriors have no room to complain. One of the best dps. The only viable tank, and great in pvp. Where does life suck that isn't self healing?
---
Same, I always just let them die,  then when asked why I'm a bad tank I tell them a variation of "maybe you shouldn't have pulled"
---
Or they play pve/rp servers
---
Nah, this is unnecessary. That's the beauty of vanilla. It's more rational choice to teach someone than to replace them.
---
People will always take the path of least resistsnce, that' why casual games have shit communities.
---
He's playing priest solo and then druid/pally with his warrior buddy
---
Hunter- less bag space.
---
feelsbadman :(
---
Not on Classic with how easy elites are
---
Exploit? Bad for the game? Unintended? Okay dude.
---
I've never ever played on a pserver. Never had the appeal to me. The sheer volatility of it being subject to being shut down at any time, the flakiness of the servers, the community moving from one pserver to another, GM power abuse. It's just never caught my attention. I still REALLY want to play vanilla again, but not til it's official.
---
&gt; but everything you've written suggests you didn't play Vanilla
---
The transaction history on account.blizzard.com doesn't go farther back than 2010, but it used to. Had many clips of me playing vanilla on my old YouTube channel that got banned cuz I upped some Family Guy clips. [What I have left is when my guild defeated Onyxia in 2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsoGDZlcty8).
---
And its not like enjoying classic is some immutable characteristic, or even a repressed identity. Its the most popular MMO in the world and fucking video game. Not to mention its not like its people who don't get video games making fun of video games, this isn't punching down, its the same exact community joking about itself. The classic community is made up of ex-retail players. These types of memes are as much mockery of others as self deprecation.
---
Nah just assholes with an inferiority complex needing to endless prove their superiority over others.
---
If you really think that way about your pet, you have an opportunity to improve. The consensus among best hunters is to have the pet on passive 100% of the time and control it with macros ONLY (/petattack and /petfollow, for example). 
---
Do that from level 10 onwards and try to make it a habit. That way, you develop muscle memory just for controlling your pet, completely mitigating those situations where you pet seems to have its own mind. 
---
Bonus tip: Try binding /petfollow to scrollwheel down and /petattack to scrollwheel up, it feels natural and is very easy to get into.
---
Engi + Mining on launch, level that engi up then farm enough arcane crystals for lionheart helm/titanic leggings/arcanite reaper etc, after that you can drop mining for whatever proff you want, i’ll keep mining myself for DME drop runs.
---
If you want to minmax in vanilla you only really have 1 profession available, because Engineering is the best for every class.

**What Can You Expect from Us?**
---
A documented community past is nice and all, but we want to maintain the mentality of what have we done lately for our community members. We want to build a strong, thriving, long term Acolytes raiding guild in World of Warcraft Classic. No one wants to join a guild that is dead 4 months into the game. We feel our history shows that we maintain long track records in the MMO’s we join.
---
Just a few items we can provide you as a member:
---
* An environment to progress and successfully complete raids and goals
---
* Active Discord to chat about World of Warcraft Classic
---
* Scheduled guild raid nights
---
* An environment where we get things done and have a fun time doing it
---
* Experienced and friendly players to help all levels of gamers
---
**What Do We Expect From You?**
---
We are looking for people who love World of Warcraft, who enjoy raiding and are looking to take part in a fun and exciting time in the history of World of Warcraft with these new Classic servers. Many great memories will be made.
---
We expect the following from you:
---
* Level-headedness
---
* Team players who value their peers and guild
---
* Active community participation
---
* Sense of self-worth and pride without arrogance
---
* 18 years of age or older
---
* Harassment of other players/members is not tolerated
---
* We expect behavior befitting adults. Drama will be quickly dealt with and should not disrupt guild activities.
---
* Liking pie is optional
---
**Socials**

I wasn't being reasonable there, just wanted to tell you that you were an ass. That's all.
---
I think this definition from urbandictionary probably fits best from what I've seen in video games: 
---
&gt;In online video games, it is that guy who is giving it 110% all the time because winning and/or having a high kill/death ratio is more important than just having fun. Try hards are most common in games like Halo or Call of Duty and are frequently seen yelling at their teammates for dying a lot.
---
In wow, the best example I can think of is someone flasking/potting in LFR and then bitching at anyone/everyone below him on DPS meters while he strokes himself off. Basically just taking things too seriously when it's not warranted.
---
Youre high off your ass. Try 1m max. Most people arent coming back to a 15 year old remake lol
---
ps; Thanks for showing me this Talent Calc. I like it a lot!
---
Keep not giving a shit about people playing on eu.
---
Back in WoD before (I unsubbed) I had been Horde for Life for years, but ended up switching to Alliance for that expansion because I kept getting decimated in Battlegrounds.  I wasn't interested in raiding so PvP was my endgame.  The saddest part is that I actually started winning as a Human DK rather than a Tauren.  When classic drops I will be going back to the Horde life, though.
---
I don't disagree that the game being unsocial is in part the players fault, but I also think blizzard has heavily enabling that behavior with a lot of "anti-social" systems (dungeon finder) that makes finding a good guild obsolete. I don't think it's a matter of people being "stupid"...
---
&gt;I watched my ignite procs kill many flag carriers from beyond the grave
---
Man, I remember how frustrating it was back in the day to run into a Warlock.  I was definitely a solid head 3 player in pvp but even when I did manage to kill the warlock I'd just die to their dots anyways...  It always made me wish I was a lock but I never did make one before I quit playing.
---
I've taken too many days off this year and can only afford one day off :(
---
I'm going to take the following Monday off so I can have a long weekend of WoW. I'm off to Spain the week after for a week so I'll be in the sun with some cocktails, hankering for some WoW, no doubt.
---
And mages don't use their wand very much anyway.
---
&gt; Pretty much every caster is reliant on their wands or you'll spend most of your time drinking.
---
Mages don't use it much, but we have free water so yeah...
---
Where exactly is OP going to engage in 2v2 PvP in Classic though? PuG/premade BGs + dueling are what he'll be doing, not some kind of imaginary arena.
---
Who hurt you. :\[
---
I highly suggest you find a guild ASAP when first starting as this game is a lot funner when played with others. That being said playing solo is also perfectly fine, but in my own opinion playing with other people makes the adventure just that much better.
---
You can play on Private if you want. They still exist. It doesn't really seem worth investing a lot of time though. I'd just goof around in it to get acclimated for Classic. I don't recommend streaming it btw, as you can get banned on Twitch on top of getting those private Servers taken down due to the exposure.
---
Dungeon finder is literally so people can mindlessly play through simple dungeons with strangers. 
---
If your looking to socialise there, your basically doing the IRL equivalent of boarding an extremely busy train at rush hour and trying to drum up a decent conversation with a stranger.
---
Then I struggle to see why you would make this post. Anyone who played vanilla would know that these things didn't exist for dungeons, professions, levelling, anything at all.
---
They will end up doing what ever they want, just like layering. But I feel they should pace it exactly the same as it was.

My first time around being a noob and not knowing what was going on was really fun. This time I'm going to have fun, but also get the Hand of Rag on my Enhance Shaman.
---
..But you've just described the definition listed in the OP... Like, literally. Sentence for sentence.

Trading a rogue(yourself) for an enemy healer is a good trade in a team fight. I would take that trade 99% of the time.

#&lt; Light's Hope Survivors &gt; ll :horde: – :NA: – PvP ll Loot Council for BiS + DKP
---
🕗 **Raid Times:** Tues &amp; Thurs 8–11 EST, Optional Monday for progression
---
**About Us:** Our goal is to be competitive in raiding as well as battleground and world pvp. To foster healthy competition, players that go the extra mile with regards to performance get rewarded with BiS items via Loot Council Lists, DKP for other items. 
---
We tuned our methods on pservers and bring that experience to the table for Classic's release. We plan on being active in wPvP and with world bosses, and expect to join Horde coalitions and partner with like-minded guilds on our server to that end, as well as forming premades for BG in the latter phases. We strive for success in PvE as well as PvP, but having a good time is of equal priority. Lok'tar Ogar, For the Horde
---
**Our Experience:** Our core played together on a pserver as a second raid group for our parent guild before F R E S H happened and the war of attrition became too much. As a guild we went 8/9 AQ, Separately, We have 15/15 Naxx experience.
---
**Expectations:** Members must be ready to excel in a competitive environment. This means they will bring all required consumables and world buffs, and perform competently each raid. New classic players are welcome as long as they are willing and able to learn at a reasonable pace. We strongly encourage PVP participation, but it is not required. 
---
Exceptional players are always considered Right now we are looking for:

Ally on my server farmed AV in Vanilla as well. AB was not a guaranteed victory, but most of the time.
---
Pop those onto some signs or t-shirts and you've got yourself a buyer!
---
Oo I like the scroll wheel binding idea!
---
Priest - respeccing costs to go from holy to shadow even though Benediction can switch to Anathema on the fly. I wanna raid holy and PvP shadow so I’m not looking forward to the gold I’m gonna have to hash out for it.
---
What do you need a Lua coder for?
---
Enhancement can be really good in PVP. Windfury RNG can give you godlike damage.
---
This needs to be implemented. It would really bother me as playing as a holy priest.
---
repost
---
Big man; so reasonable, such self awareness
---
The difference is accountability, on a server with about 1500 people per faction, reputation will spread fast. And being toxic will limit so much of your interactions, especially economic and social. People who play with others in mind will thrive in classic. That's the nature of vanilla as opposed to a tightly regulated snore fest such as bfa
---
The first one of the day boys
---
Of course they can dps.
---
You can do whatever you want. Engineering is probably one of the best for PvP though, for pretty much any class. Iron Grenades though amirite? So good. It's a bit of a money-sink though, so I'd save that for much later level 60 shenanigans. Otherwise you can absolutely make a good profit off of just about anything and the market is open to everyone in terms of competition.
---
Again, farm the cloth and make some other tailor craft your bag ?
---
Bandages. If warriors had a self heal in Vanilla as well as plate armour and heavy hitting, they'd be OP as fuck.
---
Druid - people who don't understand my class telling me how to play.
---
There were some instances where People got their old stuff back after posting a ticket. Might happen.
---
After you've summoned half of them...
---
If by compete you mean lie down and die, at least that is my memory of world pvp as a holy priest.
---
&gt;even though they are merely parroting what others have already figured out.
---
I get the sentiment behind this, but by definition is this not just learning, people cannot start out being experts on things. Reading up and then being able to explain it to others is key to true understanding and a great way to learn something for good, teachers use this to see how well one grasp the knowledge.
---
They were kind of a joke, but one of IIRC four (been a while since I've played it) major party members in the WoW prequel, Founding of Durotar, was Chen Stormstout. So while they're kind of a joke, they're kind-of not a joke. 
---
Honestly, Pandas are more rooted in the lore than C'thun. I think it's cool that the vanilla team branched out and tried to create their own lore, but all the best beats of the "classic trilogy" were stolen from WC3, so it makes a whole lot of sense that they eventually did do MoP. And MoP, while initially seeming ridiculous, was pretty awesome with ToT and SoO. Don't judge a book by its cover.
---
Even though I am pro Classic+, I am also pro "don't split the community". Not splitting the community is #1.
---
If the fight is shorter, elemental was better, but longer fights give the advantage to enhance. Ele has serious Mana regen issues. If a fight takes too long, you're essentially casting down ranked spells to proc clearcasting so you can cast high rank spells. The same thing happens to enhance/ret, in that you're also casting down ranked earth shocks or seals of command but you have rng melee mechanics you can rely on that ele can't fall back on.
---
I'm not sold, but a good well thought out guide nonetheless.
---
Gnomer looks like Nickelodeon sponsored it, AND ITS GOD DAMN FANTASTIX!!!
---
I once saw a hunter in the Wetlands when I was relatively high level. I'd recently learned how to properly use my class and saw this dude at around level 18 without a pet and meleeing mobs. I tried to tell him to get a pet and use ranged and it'll be much faster. His reply: "DOES IT CARE? I PLAY MY WAY!". Does it care has since become a staple meme amongst my friends and I to this day.
---
Played as a belf paladin for years. Gonna roll as Alliance this time around bc they have paladins...
---
In Vanilla my buddy played Warrior and I played Priest. Not ideal sinergy and priest gets focused too easily, we didnt know that when creating the chars, but PvP was still amazing as War+heals. This time we either running War+pally or War+shaman. 
---
One thing I didnt see anyone mention is that Warrior is a lot more gear dependent than Lock, and gearing Warrior for PvP is a huge huge pain. If you guys will have time/dedication to be average or above geared, Id say Warrior for sure, but if youre going to be undergeared, Warrior can be frustrating - I talk from experience.
---
Have you ever watched Maydie or Pat R14 warr PvP videos? What about Drakedog destro lock video?
---
You can expect to not get groups with that attitude dawg.
---
Free mount did you need any more convincing for your alt?

"Patch 0.9 (2004-08-17): A failed Ritual of Summoning should no longer cost a soul shard."

Oh man I remember hitting 85 on my Paladin in Uldum. It was during the airplane/Indiana Jones quest chain. I looked at my hp and was floored to see 119k. That number felt so unreal at the time, and I felt invincible.
---
Transmog is gay and ruins the appeal of even getting cool armor in the first place
---
Rhymes with bonos has done 3 full cycles with no drama, you're being unnecessarily hysterical.
---
Druid, deep balance sux :(
---
Yes I think using the in game options available to group with other players is a good indication of the current state of the game you cretin.
---
Where's VC?
---
Rogue: Definitely hate leveling lock picking.
---
Nobody gives a fuck, report me
---
Yeah, no both those words suck to be called. One is being someone who isn't actually that good but attempts to emulate those are good for recognition. Tryhards are the type of people who pubstomp with smurfs and act like that makes them good. While the other is being stuck up and thinking your better than others for petty reasons, specifically happening to be on the top of a hierarchy. Like, if you joined a new club and the guys at the top of the hierarchy were jackasses because of their rank, they would be elitists, and they would suck. They're both insults.
---
WotLK introduced sharding for story purposes. (Sharding =/= cross server play)
---
The sharding in LK was so bad, that you sometimes weren't even able to see people, that were in your group if they were missing a sub-zone changing quest.
---
Most of the things classic fans dislike about modern wow started in WotLK.
---
Never bothered with macros. Its CTRL+1 and CTRL+2 by default and I never understood why that was so difficult for people
---
This is a false statement.
---
people have tried to do this to me on retail but then I don't die because it's retail and I queued as healer in DPS spec

I'm not asking for much, just a talent that gives 25% leech and a 20% of your strength as HP5.
---
That’s nice. The OP says to specifically state any requirements such as being LGBTQ+ friendly, so I specifically stated it. Being transgender is an integral part of my life and currently affects almost every social interaction I have. I’m here trying to make friends, so it’s crucial for me to explicitly state up front that I only want to find people who are okay with me.
---
I don’t know why you felt the need to comment, but maybe you’ll realize why my “choices” are relevant if you would open your eyes and see how prevalent transphobia is amongst people, especially online. If you actually are curious, look at the twitch chat in this video and maybe you’ll understand: https://youtu.be/G1v8PlGfcwg
---
Good day.
---
Beta is international dumbass xDxDxDxDxD
---
Stone Form!
---
For real, the art and music in bfa is some of the best they’ve ever done. Boralus is an incredible harbor-city, and I love how they made each zone transition smoothly into each other (instead of the sharp cutoff borders in older zones where the ground texture immediately changes). Like as you get closer to Nazmir from Zuldazar the ground starts turning a deeper green then gray, the trees and foliage start looking swampier, etc, it just looks so natural.
---
Shame the gameplay and story are a joke
---
I believe that flying as we think of it and immersion are mutually exclusive. 
---
The closest thing you could use would be heavily modified flying that limited you to short bursts of flight with long periods of time between flights. This was one of the solutions I proposed in a past conversation about how you could modify TBC to work without flight. Just allow a few very short flights per hour. However, other than this bandaid solution, there's just really no point to having flying in an MMORPG.
---
Because it's been SOOO long.
---
[Here's some more evidence, just for the hell of it :)](https://i.imgur.com/xreqIT3.jpg?1)
---
Honestly, its mostly the story.
---
Arthas was the most hyped character in the game and people were excited to go to Northrend.
---
One of the earliest things to practice and remember is your pet is an extension of yourself. No great hunter ever ignores their pet. They don't just leave it in defensive and think it's good to go. A hunter's pet control can either destroy a dungeon group or really make people wonder why they hated hunters in the first place. Luckily a friend of mine played hunter through all of Vanilla and TBC and having a hunter who can manually control very well like always  being ready to distracting shot -&gt; Trap or instantly throw their pet on a add accidentally pulled by another player and turning growl (Taunt) on their pet, or simply just saving the stupid stupid healer who is running from the tank after pulling agro on a mob (Taunt is only melee range in Vanilla). Can really make hunters shine as one of the most amazing utility classes in the game.
---
Not the person you replied to, but the content is designed such that the easiest way to see all of it is to solo (since you only need coordination to see that same content on higher difficulty levels).
---
That's the nice thing about Vanilla/Classic... making friends and building a community makes the game easier and lets you see things you couldn't see otherwise.
---
Well, so was my initial comment, but people started discussing with me, so of course I discuss back. I mean, you do realize you are on a *forum*, right? It is literally made for discussions.
---
True.
---
Retribution paladins only look like they do lousy DPS because their very presence means everyone else does more. True story that 😛
---
I didn't realise I was being hysterical. Thanks for that. Slap me next time.
---
Consider the ogres in Tanaris for roughly L50-52.
---
My god I thought this was over already
---
It's not surprising. You lower the bar and lots more people engage in the content than before. You raise the bar and those people aren't able to do the content anymore. A small proportion get better, another portion complain on the forums and the rest unsub without saying anything.
---
Paladin- need a kick in PvP to finish healers and help against casters. Obviously this would make Paladins kind of OP but most of the time when I lost 1v1s it was because of this.
---
Makes you 100% stronger even if it doesn't actually do anything
---
WoW was an actual MMORPG, by that I mean it had a sense of community with rpg aspects. BFA is none of those things. There are a lot of QoL improvements in BFA that don't exist in classic, which people will look back on Classic like "fuck I wish i had that", like being able to hit a spell and auto dismount without having to make a macro for it, but Classic is more akin to something like EQ (though way more accessible), than it is to, say, Hello Kitty Island Adventure : Themepark edition
---
Not going to report you friend &lt;3 That's okay, that is why the downvote button is there :)!
---
Just look up 'bis' lists instead of 'pre-bis' ones.
---
your welcome! :P Its great indeed!
---
How am I gatekeeping? I truly believe most of the replies are just based on personal flares of 'reee he suggested classic isnt perfect' because frankly nobody has contributed something other than a statement versus my practical example. I believe this is because you're being unreasonably prickly about the idea that the game wasn't perfect in vanilla. Maybe I missed the disclaimer but I'm a huge fan of it and will be playing it from launch. I've played on vanilla private servers consistently over the years and retail too for some reason. 
---
Let's try another practical discussion and get off feelings. 
---
One version has a built in quest finder. The other doesn't. A brand new player will have an easier time with one than the other because of this. Would you disagree with that?!
---
doesn't matter, didn't get invited anyway...
---
Well yeah they can cast abilities that do damage.
---
But if you're going to play a Shaman or Druid thinking you will DPS in dungeons or raids at 60, I hope you have a lot of patience or really good friends.
---
And find a group to do it with.
---
You may have misunderstood, I was not replying to your post I was replying to the user above who later deleted his comments.
---
Yeah, exactly this. I was happy about the changes and looking forward to get some of the vanilla feeling back with dungeons that required a brain and not aoeing everything down. And then the tears started flowing and the reality dawned on me.
---
Herb/alch is legit. So is eng/mining. The former for easy access to raid consumes and the latter for pvp fun.
---
“Hang on, killing scorpions for shards”
---
Racials
---
Not everyone is hardcore min-max game Bros
---
Kick is like a catch all term for interrupts in wow, even though it's the name of the rogue one

For aussies, there are no aussie private vanilla servers any more.

# &lt;AlphaPhase&gt; Horde| Server - NA-PvP| casual/semi-hardcore| 
---
Recruiting all classes &amp; specs 
---
Raid schedule TBD - (Leaning towards Sunday 7/8-12pm, EST)
---
**Intro:** The foundation of AP is a group of friends that love video games, raunchy banter, and cannot wait for Classic’s release! Welcoming everyone – from the most experienced to ‘I’ve never played WoW before’. While we will be progressive in PvE content, it will be at our pace (we all have lives: careers, families, school, etc.). Will also be doing PvP scheduled events - because who doesn’t enjoy killing gnomes.  
---
**Expectations:** For any member it is to have fun and enjoy the game! Aimed at those that wish to raid, the expectation is to meet the raid schedule (when released), come prepared with BiS/pots, and know the fights (or at least do some research beforehand). 
---
If any questions, feel free to PM me! [https://discord.gg/Yfexwze](https://discord.gg/Yfexwze)
---
I also used the boost on a priest as a returning player.  I went shadow and had fun.  I died too many times trying to pull too many mobs trying to get to 120 ASAP.  Sounds like you just didn’t challenge yourself and called it quits when it was subsequently too easy.
---
Now I’m at (IMO) the best part of the game: max level PvP.  There’s so much tagging on retail in this sub who barely gave it a proper chance.
---
Forgot the pro for dwarf priest: Big ole booty
---
Just to clarify, you were enjoying the game until you decided to group with random players, those players were toxic, and that is the game's fault?  Sure, you can blame Blizz for catering to those type of people, but you have to bear some of the blame for choosing to wallow in the muck with them.
---
While it's possible, though unlikely, on other websites. It's not at all possible to use something like that via Reddit's CSS.
---
Resto druid: no Res, also we don't stack.
---
Most locks are happy to help summon. It depends though, you should take the initiative to help out in some cases. 
---
Say you’re running ZF. You have two people in Tanaris, plus the warlock in Dustwallow. Meanwhile, somebody is at Felwood and somebody is in Badlands. You’d be doing yourself a disservice as the warlock to *not* summon. Even if they put 100% effort into getting there, they would be 10-12 minutes behind, and then you’re just holding the group up for some reason.
---
Just saying... I don’t expect a lock to be the answer to somebodies laziness. But when I invite a warlock, I’m aware of the tools they have and use them to the best of their ability. In that example, if I politely asked the warlock to gather in Tanaris and summon, and they flatly refused? I would kick them. I expect a mage to give water and food in exchange for a “pls and thank you” just as I expect a hunter to use freezing trap when called upon.
---
I want to play mage on alliance, which I did not play in vanilla, but which is my main in modern WoW. 
---
But my friends are apparently all going horde, so I will probably end up playing an orc warrior just like I did in vanilla. Just because I don't want to be troll or undead.
---
There are a lot of people in the smoke pit talking about it.  The smoke pit is the intelligence network of any workplace.  The hype is real.
---
My pleasure bro i hope you end up on a PVP server it is way more fun as a rogue!
---
YES THANK YOU!!!!! Finally a picture where the tank and healer are on the same side against the 3 other window licking DPS.
---
Loot is going to be harder to get when every raid has 10+ people rolling on the same stuff as you.
---
Sorry you feel that way - it was chosen by community request for those nostalgia feels.
---
Reserving items in dungeons was a thing in vanilla, I don't know how people are even forgetting groups of friends would run groups and sell items(specific items).  Our guild in TBC started selling dungeon and raid gear but I know people where doing it in vanilla.  When you as a dps has sat around town for a hour looking for a group to Ubers for a few items. It may be worth to pay a little gold. 
---
I feel a lot of people just didn't know stuff like this was going on so they don't remember it happening. 
---
People sell attunement runs also.
---
Seems like there should be a more efficient way to communicate that would result in no waste.
---
Well, having a list of pro and cons certainly helps but there's something else than the numbers of elements : the weight in value you put in it for each. So a better system would be to put "pts" for each pros and negative pts in each cons from your preferences since it's mainly subjective.
---
Cool, still dont care about eu players.
---
Ultimately my early dungeon impressions are from 2.0-2.3 (yes, 2.3 had big changes, but it was made easier, not harder).  I don't think mob pulls are doing the initial dps they should, and I don't think the players being 'better' does much to impact initial pull dps vs tank.
---
While all of us are going on memory, I don't think blizz having a 1.12 server working is the same as them having the metadata for 1.12 (which they have explicitly said they do NOT).  metadata is where mob dps would have been.
---
Welcome back to 2004 !
---
Nope they can't. Remember world pvp, how you had to have your head on a swivel all the time? Not anymore. Need a piss? Just mount up and hold space for a few secs. You're safe.
---
Oh I have this long journey from one end of the map to the other. Wonder what adventures I'll encounter along the way. None. Because I mount up and hit autorun in the general direction of my destination whilst I go make a coffee or take a shit.
---
I believe that this pretty much was the wording Ion used in one of his interviews. They stated that the beta is really, really small in size and that it probably wouldn't work out to get a beta if you just resub for this chance.
---
This legit made me lol so hard. Nice work lmao
---
Warrior popularity will drop quickly once people start leveling.
---
meme screens so much better
---
Engineering is a must for pve or pvp. Fishing and cooking are your best ways of making gold especially as a warrior because you can’t solo farm like mages or locks.
---
If they are both first characters and not alts. 
---
The priest (holy,disc,shawdow spec'd doesn't matter) totally carries the warrior for the first 20 or so.
---
If the warrior is a geared alt, then they can actually bring something to the table sooner.
---
Play alliance so that you can appreciate the fishies when you travel the deep run tram
---
I'm fine with it most of the time but there's always that guy that won't help but always wants help.
---
blizzard has said they don't have the metadata for 1.12.  They may not know what the right dps for mobs is either.
---
I guess to rephrase this. I’m looking for a generally accepted formidable list. I’ve seen a few with a bunch of different items. Is there a source that most people tend to use?
---
There's an incredible amount of functionality and personalization to this website of yours that's free to use.  I don't suppose you're going to get me hooked on this, and then start charging a fee once classic launches?  I see you're Canadian so by the law of the mounties you have to tell me if this is all a ploy for a cash grab.
---
I don't know how it is in the current expansion, but WoD (and I guess Legion as well) your own fortress felt like a glorified game lobby. The world has, over the expansions, pretty much disappeared besides the initial leveling.
---
This is why I'm taking the NEXT week off of work. Hopefully they'll get everything sorted by then.
---
Not a single thing you just said was right, I feel bad for anyone who has to read this comment and most of all you for typing it.
---
A lot of classes suffer from less bag space, locks must carry shards, several hybrids carry multi purpose gear for different roles (druids especially), warriors too carry multiple gear.
---
It's not so bad using a quiver in comparison if you think about it, sometimes lock shards can exceed 2 bags prior to a raid.
---
This is off topic but I was just reading your comment on someones post from a year ago called:
---
&gt;**I thought TBC sucked and introducing TBC servers is a terrible idea. Change my mind.**
---
 I got to the part where you said:
---
&gt;As opposed to fail servers like ***Anvilmar***, which I was on, where there  was only one Horde raiding guild and it was still stuck in MC when TBC  arrived.
---
Man I know your pain. My characters are stuck on Undermine, which is linked to Anvilmar, and I know the pains of being in a dead realm, raiding and pop wise. Undermine is such a mess, there is no salvaging it.
---
A lot of people are going to roll mage for PvE reasons.
---
Mages are the easiest to level.
---
World scaling is not a mistake at all. It allows friends to play with each other who otherwise wouldn't be able to due to level disparity. It allows you to visit zones at different levels and finish zones without outleveling them.
---
The issue with 110-120 is that that 116 your legendaries stop working from 116-120 mobs scale faster than you do. Then at 120 you scale faster than mobs as your item level increases.
---
They should of had the cliff at 110 and then a very slow rise in strength until 120.
---
You could always ask the group?
---
I chuckled but on a serious note I'm not sure why any priest would tolerate this, I certainly did not. Moreover I made certain that the tank knew his place on the matter or I'd replace him with a druid.
---
As much as I'll get down-voted, I plan on playing the same class/spec as my REDACTED toon. I just love the way my Retri paladin plays, being a jack of all trades spec has saved my raid on more than one occasion. I love referring to it as a boy scout, I got a spell for every occasion! That being said, it's going to take alot of time and effort to get back to where he is and yes I change specs to heal if the raid comp requires it, but that doesn't stop me from throwing out some clutch heals to save that dps or healer when I'm ret. Feel free to PM me to check him out, I'm pretty proud of how far he's come and can't wait to do it again. I fucking love vanilla wow.
---
Hunter - good luck getting a raid spot, and your dps starts dropping off like crazy in aq and naxx.
---
They got your money baby.
---
Millions of subs, 10k beta players.
---
told the wife she needs to find another guy to raise our kids. she can keep the house but i'm moving my computer into the shed
---
Druid: lack of regular rez. Makes you feel like an incomplete healer if you go resto.
---
You should never expect a portal. Or if you do, at *least* tip 20s. I’m with you (but not now you worded it) on the summons and candy, food and water, but nobody owes you a city portal.
---
No chance you retail lot have already proven you'll misuse it. Children can't be trusted.
---
LoL
---
Got a source? cause pretty sure they said the opposite and they have all the 1.12 data.
---
Don't- alliance zones are more enjoyable.
---
Get full bwl/aq40 gear for my hunter and cause havoc around azeroth. I wont have enough time for naxx. 
---
I got a spot in my old raiding guild that's filled with people who are more casual now, but almost all of them used to raid at top 100 level in every expansion before BFA.
---
This is actually pretty nice and seems very useful. Did you setup your own database of all classic items are you pulling from a source?
---
did you try mythics? they are more challenging than any classic-wotlk 5 man ever were.
---
Play alliance so I may have Thrall's retribution on your treachery.
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
I mean we have no consensus as a community yet unlike no changes and the want for classic.
---
As a classic player, it is fair to wonder what Blizzard has in mind for the long time longevityof the game
---
Why are you out in the world as Holy though? Unless you have a partner.
---
Not sure if i will happen, its been like 10 years or something since i played, i've also moved halfway across the world and it won't actually let me contact support, everything is greyed out to me.
---
I have the same dilemma. Played Warlock, so Warlock would naturally invoke a nostalgic feeling, but i have a big desire to play Vanilla rogue. What do, what do..
---
It's been long sure but achievements weren't in the game for 2 whole expansions how bad is your memory buddy!
---
Yes sorry, hit cap is always most important
---
&gt; I did using the LFG tool was also the first dungeon I've ever done where nobody said a single word during the entire run.
---
you might be sorely disappointed... on beta, atleast, people barely ever speak in dungeon beyond the mandatory LFG/LFM part.
---
I was designated "Put only 1 point into Improved Healthstone" for awhile because it made a max rank healthstone with just slightly lower healing.. The things you did to optimize small things.
---
my main in vanilla was a priest. if my friends don't back out in august, i'm maining a priest again except this time we're going horde. if they do back out, i'll still go horde but i'll likely make a rogue
---
tanks have too big of toes. ill drop any group where people are trying to teach aggressive lessons &amp; I'm playing holy. 
---
imagine having such an inflated ego attached to your character, hard pass
---
username doesn't check out...
---
Played hunter and warrior back in vanilla, then mage/rogue/priest raiding on private servers, im going rogue classic
---
I think the true annoying thing for locks is when other people continue doing their thing until they get a summon and then refuse because they're still in the AH doing stuff. Lock just spent time getting to instance, and waste a shard on you :/
---
Oxhorn? Is that you?
---
Ok
---
I was thinking of rolling gnome mage but then I saw how shoddy the armour clipping looks (especially hoods). Meh
---
The truest way is to maintain the original design is exactly to design new content that will allow the game to be healthy by sticking to the classic design
---
Cool dude
---
I never said it would be hard, but why would I waste an extra 5 minutes in a dungeon with a ret when I could have someone else there instead. Might as well sell that spot and earn some gold instead of boosting a redacted ret paladin for free
---
Based.
---
It's not about mix-maxing dude. You run out of mana after a few spells, same with Shadow Priest. Why would anyone bring a caster that only fights for half the encounter when they can bring mages, warlocks or any of the melee specs?
---
As I said, you need patience to play those specs because the fights will take much longer and you will need a mana break after every pack.
---

---
This is a great resource. Take it with a grain of salt as I have seen a few errors, but this is absolutely the best thing you will find.
---
Each class/spec is broken down by phase and what should be BiS for that release.
---
Guess I have bad memory then :/
---
I think it will take some theory crafting on the real classic servers to figure out. I read that currently on pservers howl does not scale with things like backstab but instead it just adds a flat amount to any attack after modifiers have been applied. 
---
Secondly it has only 15 yards range. That means if you are placed in a melee group to provide trueshot aura it will only benefit 4 melee dps at best as you are usually out of range. If your pet can not enter melee then you could use a windserpent as it has a real ranged attack.
---
That is what I have read so far but I have no real experience playing the game.
---
Thank you.
---
Everytime I've tried horde I went back to Alliance. Beyond racials the horde just have ugly models ugly cities and meh zones.
---
Picking flowers, doing some rep grind, fishing, getting runes or other consumables. Questing (Silithus?).
---
NA PvP Horde - Shammy main
---
Have recently become a Father so will my playing time could be a bit sporadic.  Looking to do end-game content but not at an elite pace.  Planning on rolling Shaman and am happy to heal so I can hopefully be a flexible slot on raid nights.  Ideal raid times are between 8pm - Midnight EST on weeknights, could do Saturday / Sunday night as well.  Interested in some PvP pre-mades and world PvP as well.  Also, some people to level with at a somewhat relaxed pace (likely take me 2 months to reach 60).  Overall a relaxed and mature player. Hit me up!
---
Yes, I had a guild in Legion. Modern WoW being what it is, the attitude I describe was prevalent in that guild, as well. Camaraderie was fairly low. Various things that happened in the game (random legendaries) didn't help at all.
---
I imagine Mythic raiding guilds in modern WoW may still be decent, but you shouldn't have to be a top player to get some nice community interaction.
---
Probably Gnome Warrior. If you're just going to level 5.
---
Maybe Warlock but they kinda need their Imp to be fast. Mages Oom quick and you aren't that fast on either till you get your Wand.
---
I'd say Warrior.
---
&gt;*Pros*  
---
&gt;12. I have never levelled a Horde character to 60, lots of new things to experience  
---
&gt;*Cons*  
---
&gt;7. Unfamiliar with Horde levelling routes 
---
That's kind of contradictory.
---
I'd suggest go lock if you want to play it in a normal/casual way.
---
I'd suggest Priest if you want to be an elitest hardcore raider. (+you confirm the Alliance elitist mindset by doing this!)
---
My two cents: Roll UD lock
---
You also get cancer if you finish them all.
---
I mean, you see the content on raidfinder/normal the same way as you watch a video of someone doing it. Doesn't mean it actually feels satisfying to complete.
---
Judging endgame content talking about dungeon finder is just inherently misinformed and wrong. You aren't playing endgame unless you're playing heroic/Mythic raiding content or high Mythic+ - both of which requires a guild, a group of friends or a community to pool from, all requiring socialising and being memorable.
---
horde has same thing in the undercity courtyard
---
How to get a flawless team. DPS wait  2 sec with dpsing. Especially if aoe. Taunt can miss but it's not a bit deal warriors have 3. Healers don't get tunnelvisioned and tanks watch your healers mana. These three rules for every class makes a run amazing. Also let the tank pull. It saves him having to pop challenging shout to catch five mobs spreading up between everyone.
---
there's no problem with DPS chain pulling. there is a problem with mediocre tank players having a seriously out of check ego.
---
The overwhelming darkness and the excessive spacing is what does it.  I brought it up ages ago and you guys mentioned basically the whole thing was ported over from someone else's creation, so no one knew how to tweak it.  Completely understandable, but it's definitely a sub style that some are gonna hate.
---
Why dont you play BFA where theyve implemented everything they learned the past 15 years.
---
Lol.
---
If youre going to release classic, do it properly.
---
Yup, I know the chance was slim, but can afford the loss. Still, who knows :P
---
I wish someone would type out a guide for this
---

Hi, /u/kippensoepHD
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1nke2/pvp_or_pve_server_for_pve_players/).
---
I've had tanks tell me, "please quit healing \_so\_and\_so\_" because of stupid crap. It's almost always a rogue. Everyone gives hunters shit but I've had most of my bad experiences as a healer with melee doing stupid stuff. Another interesting piece of anecdotal evidence is that I generally LIKE having ret paladins in the group (had very few bad ones) because they tend to have better situational awareness of most melee.
---
The pain with casual guilds is just getting 40 people to show up every week. You can spend over an hour just filling the raid and getting everyone there.
---
Really it's just like management at a job.
---
Please, I know more people who got banned in WOD for the HonorBuddy sting and buying gold than anything else and I've been playing/actively in communities since early Vanilla
---
Flight paths is flying. Add more flight paths.
---
Early Cata was among the best WoW has been in a long time in terms of difficulty.
---
Now they just achieve difficulty artificially with the M+ mechanism.
---
Sure, but that's besides the point. Having an easier time is pointless if you are bored and there already are hundreds of QTE filled games with "exploration" on rails that don't look  as dated as WoW and actually have decent pacing. 
---
Retail tries to follow trends in the industry after being a completely different game earlier, but it really doesn't have anything to hook new players that aren't attached to the IP. They sacrificed a world that felt hostile and intimidating to make some kind of theme park, but all the kids are playing fortnite anyway.
---
i'm probably going to just gather for the first few months and try to make some gold tbh \^\^ mining/skinning I think. You?
---
wherever i'm farming whatever
---
No SM:Armory?
---
&gt; And there was definitly group quests in Wrath. I remember being able to solo some but not all. Maybe /u/GenitalJouster is a great player not having to ever group up for them but I did.
---
I totally see how this passive aggressiveness is asked for by me casually asking why people liked Wrath so much
---
Hey man I think someone just posted another meme in the classic wow subreddit, you should probably go break it down and analyze it in depth before it’s too late!
---
Yeah really seems like these people are completely stuck in time
---
Jaja
---
Thanks buddy! believe it or not, I chose rogue mostly for the RP aspect... pick pocket, stealth, lockpicking, poisons... not for the pvp aspect (though I enjoy that too).
---
Weather or not I will end on pvp server is not my choice, I will follow my buddies whatever they decide! My vote is on RP-PVP is they decide to release one.. In both scenarios I am sure  i will have lots of fun :P
---
I am trying it on a certain pserver now and warrior seems slow. I thought lock, but when do you get imp? I know mage just oom's so fast.
---
People will still play BFA.  You under estimate how popular retail WoW is.  You may not like it but millions do.
---
I'm surprised 95% of the subs don't feel the way you feel(and I feel the same).
---
Love the last one, dream big.
---
I love watching those conversations. Especially when it ends with, "...why weren't you attacking the skull, you benighted troglodyte?!"
---
Mage: how conjure water isn't always 20 at a time. 
---
Warrior: the lack of good dps gear.
---
Oooof - what are you leaning towards? Love all of them. What's your idea for end game?
---
gnomes make sense. the alliance has humans, smaller humans, and smallest humans.  it's elves who do not make sense, they try and pretend to be taller humans but they're just tuskless trolls
---
Why the hell gnome? They are incredibly weak 1-10, go dwarf they do way more damage early.
---
Confirmed. As a healer, I get this message from tanks and I'm already 2 steps ahead of them on that task.
---
&gt; They were designed as a free gear boost.
---
That's an awful design choice, though? In a game that had historically been about a journey, just handing out free very good loot is pretty bad? Why would you ever want to systemically hand out free rewards to players?
---
That vacation in Spain will be reminiscent of house parties in high school when you just wish you would have stayed home playing wow.
---
Serious question, was that in vanilla?
---
&gt; I play Horde on retail (mostly blood elves)   
---
&gt; I really like every vanilla alliance race  
---
Nope, you have Alliance written all over you.
---
That's coolbeans, can't wait to call in the gnomeregan death squads.
---
Yea that sure is a big one that came after WotlK
---
So i am pretty sure in WC3 the gnomes were the inventors of all the dwarf tech. So like the gyrocopter was a gnomish design they just weren't in the game. They are the true tinkerers of the alliance side. But i understand they do have the best death sound in the game.
---
Except for planned pulls like hunter FD traps.
---
After decades playing as feral I recently sat down and looked at the talent trees. Planned out a good specc and then remembered that I have to rely on leather items for rogues that are not limited to rogues. I’ll try, but I am afraid that, when I reach max level, I’ll just be the group healer agin, or maybe find a raidleader who plays mage and wants my 3% crit moonkin aura.
---
I've read your message several times now, but I just can't figure out what you mean :)  
---
"See previous blue posts guy" Is it a special redditor I am looking for?
---
Here's the thing, man.  The problem with the whole "Dedicated player in a casual guild, helping them to advance" isn't that the casual players are too inept or too incompetent to help.  The issue is almost always availability.  Casual players tend not to put in the same effort to be available, which means your raid nights end up with you consistently being short-handed.
---
IMO, that's the key difference between casual and hardcore guild.  The player skill usually isn't that different.  It's the availability.  Raid prep is probably the other factor, but it's secondary to availability.
---
jesus dude
---
Paladin - ret is awful :(
---
Probably going to roll mage or priest instead
---
I mean even imp might is at the top of the tree. So a holy could fit it into their build pretty easy. 
---
Imp Ret Aura and Sanctity Aura are both not worth. I mean you could argue for Ret Aura but the paladin would be the only person really benefiting from extra holy damage from Sanctity Aura.
---
So all you are left with Vindication which does that de buff even work in raids? Pretty sure it doesn’t.
---
It's UBRS and LBRS, not BRSU and BRSL.
---
Funny you mentioned this. I found my experience to be the opposite. There are assholes on both factions.
---
Random paladin decked with full reckoning stacks runs and one shot a t3 tank for 11k damage lul
---
There’s going to be a fresh server dropping June 22 so if you want to practice launch day, it might be a good time to test.
---
Orc has a 25% increased chance to resist stun. What more reason do you need?
---
I love these and I love the feel you managed to capture in all of the logos, the small tilt is somewhat of an eyesore for me personally but I see and appreciate the effort you put into these :)
---
Thanks for sharing and well done!
---
You mean /World?  No problem! Have fun being a blacklisted DPS. Classic is going to weed out all non hackers who don't pack the gear to serve in our beloved faction.
---
What does that have to do with anything? Your comment is a confusing reply. It doesn't change what I said.
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt;
---
Faction: Horde
---
Region: NA
---
Server: PvP
---
Method : Semi-Hardcore w/ Loot Council
---
Raid Times: Monday, Wednesday at 8pm CST. 
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt; is a brand new guild created by long term players who raided into Naxx when Vanilla was live. More recently we have been playing on private servers. We are older now and realize that life sometimes gets in the way of this game we love so much. We can’t play at all times like we used to so we need to make the most of it. What makes Vanilla WoW so special is the journey and the community you enjoy it with. We are building a family and we hope you consider joining us if you’d like to be a part of that.
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt; will be focused on competing with three day guilds while maintaining a two day weekly raid schedule. However we are taking a few days off for the initial push to 60. We are currently planning to do Ony/MC exactly one month after launch. We will make the most of our raid times and expect all of our members to be prepared and consistent. We may not exactly be a server first competitive guild for phase 1, but we plan to clear all other phases within the first lockout they are released. As we evolve we will rival most hardcore guilds through later phases while keeping our raid days to a minimum.
---
We are recruiting both extremely experienced and newer players who are willing to grow and develop with our team. All members are expected to handle coaching well, and be patient with loot. It comes so slowly in vanilla but it will come. Every person in the raid team will be expected to come with consumables and flasks for progression. We do anticipate having some newer players in the guild so we need patient members who are willing to help guide and assist our newbies.
---
On our off nights we plan to do 20 man raids or PvP. We love both organized battleground teams and world PvP. 
---
If you’re interested in joining our team please contact us on discord for more information.

---
This is exactly why I actually enjoy healing as a Druid. I always have a rezz up for the tank, in case I fuk up. Others are always aware that the price of failure is the long walk, and are less prone to doing something stupid.
---
Humans need to be taken out of, they are literally the most basic and boring race in wow
---
Well, retail is at level 120 now
---
They'll probably just make it level 60 and double the XP needed for every part.
---
So probably:
---
- 1-30 for base game
---
- 30-40 for TBC/LK
---
- 40-45 for Cata/Mop
---
- 45-50 for WoD
---
- 50-55 for Legion
---
- 55-60 for BfA
---
This is why they are in WoW. To trigger people like you.
---
We have been shitting on BFA since this sub was made.
---
My impression was that Mythic raiding requires no-life level dedication? The average guild won't even look at me for Mythic raiding.
---
What is everyone else supposed to do? There's lots of content in Vanilla that doesn't require you to be the best of the best.
---
I did some Mythic+ dungeon runs and that experience was mostly awful since timed runs hardly encourage people to sit around and talk and slowly turtle. Vs., I love running Vanilla dungeons.
---
I finished SM with 3 people once. It was painful but less painful than having the other 2 idiots.
---
Rets have almost nothing to do but stand there, so they are either paying very close attention (playing the game) or not paying attention at all (watching porn).
---
I'd try to grind mobs that had useful items on them like buff food ingredients, two for one. Also its been a while, but if the shards persist after logoff,  I might have usually farmed shards if necessary after raid as to just be ready for the next raid just in case I didn't get on early enough.
---
Regardless, lock was tons of fun. I love the spells, having pets, cool looking epic mount, easy solo farming, friendly lock raid chat channel. I was tempted to go lock again, but leaning towards it being my primary alt and go with a healer main.
---
Meanwhile, a lot of people have an account as old as yours, didn't unsub a single day and still don't have access to the beta. Are they more or less worthy than you ? Who really care. You will still be allowed to play on release date, like all of us.
---
...why you kick me?
---
Oh well....
---
If you take your own professions, you will need to divert from leveling to focus on your trade skill for huge amounts of time, to make level appropriate gear upgrades.  Otherwise the gear you can craft are going to be 10+ levels behind what you need.
---
You will also sink incredible sums of money into your profession, unless you skip every single recipe except for the ones required to level your skill.
---
A druid, is an even more strong case, because There are no BiS Bind on pickup leatherworking gear for druid, so your much better off just buying what you need, or providing the mats for what you need.
---
Real solutions.
---
FAP is a good start, yeah. Certainly going to make the mage use some tools to counter, but it's not automatically game over.
---
Assuming you don't have teammates to purge/dispel/devour the FAP, polymorph is the obvious play. You need something to wait out the FAP. If sheep isn't cutting it, you could try an invis pot, magic dust, mind control helm, or just kite.
---
It's the nature of Vanilla PvP. Whoever tries harder tends to win.
---
Naxx was remember fondly by people who didn't raid much. It was the perfect difficulty for a PUG or casual guild.
---
If you run with a guild group, y’all can fairly easily just funnel those onto one player at a time. Trying to collect them via pug is kinda cancer though.
---
Looking for NA PVP semi-casual guild playing 8-12ish central time.  Never really played vanilla enjoyed TBC and WOTLK.  Looking forward to getting to experience it this time around.  I have a wife, kids, and other non-wow related real life things but plan to play most nights after the kids go to bed.  Looking for a group of like-minded folks to gear up with and do some raiding, pvp, etc with.  I'm open to horde or alliance.  Haven't decided on a class yet but am currently leveling a few 1-19 on pservers to get a feel for them in dungeon and early bgs (the twink fest is brutal in this bracket though...) to help me decide before launch.
---
I know there's still active account around, and people who've subbed every month since day one. I've not said anything else. I still hope I might get to play some early Classic WoW.
---
Fair enough, see you in STV!
---
I think Classic had the right amount of flight paths
---
No useful during the leveling, a must do in raid if you don't want to be a noob.
---
I definitely didn't come up with that one, I simply took the advice from very skilled hunters and never looked back. Can recommend a lot.
---
The zeppelin is a big plus for travelling between continents. Undead Racial is great (PvP). Orc racial is great (PvP). Low level instance progression is more conveniently located (RFC lv 14, WC 18, SFK 22 just a zeppelin away, BFD 24 not far from Barrens, RFD 30 Barrens, RFK 34 Barrens) . I feel more tough when I play Horde, Alliance is more soft and weak.
---
It can be a huge problem in Mythic +, because thats all about doing it quick. A huge part of mythic plus as a tank is knowing how much you can successfully pull based on the level and affixes. A DPS deciding "Hey we can pull one more" leads to a wipe when I'm already pulling as much as I possibly can and still do safely.
---
Unless the ret pally is also lazy lol
---
I can find it, it was from 2017.
---
Would it matter to you, though?  Be honest!
---
They are doing it to get acclimated to CLASSIC system. Remember that Private servers were not using original source data, and a lot of things were changed - either accidentally or intentionally. Things like proc rate, armor values, etc. A lot of stuff that people are used to on P. Servers will not always work on classic.
---
And of course, big streamers. Big streamers won't risk losing relationship with blizz by streaming private servers, so they do it on official ones. And where big streamers go, their sheep crowds follow.
---
Here's the thing...there are going to be A LOT of wipes in classic. MOST of the time people are going to be OK with it and the conversation will go like that (hey let's be careful here) or "sorry guys my fault" and the group moves on. Sometimes the tank will simply not have the levels or gear to finish (think scholo), and sometimes there will be the guy with downs and gets kicked.  The fact that it will take 20-30 for a group to actually get to the instance plus fill the group will be the most challenging part and groups die more often before they start. Think of alliance trying to get to RFD with Horde in the area - it's crazy. Nobody wants to fail generally speaking.
---
Shadow Bolt. The new effect looks more dynamic, but not nearly as satisfying as launching a laughing skull at someone.
---
Not even quality trolling, just sad to see people like you.
---
Blessing of freedom is a godsend to any warrior.
---
Enjoy being hunted by higher levels while trying to quest. By week 2 STV, Duskwood, thousand needles will be full rogues eating lowbies.
---
I'd actually recommend herbalism+alchemy for warrior.
---
Unless you put a lot of effort into keeping your mining/blacksmithing at a decent level, the profession will hardly provide you with useful gear throughout the leveling-phase, if you don't give up on it alltogether.
---
Alchemy is much easier to keep at a decent level while you are leveling. Healing potions of varying strength are one of the core-components of how you level it. And you'll very likely have plenty of situations where they make the difference between having to do a corpserun or not.
---
If your not raiding mythic, you didn't have a guild.
---
It.sounds elitist, but heroic is very easily clearable by PuG's two weeks into a patch. You dont need a tight organised group of players to do it.

There are literal thousands of guilds clearing mythic, let's not pretend its only 'the elite'.
---
The way this read, I thought the same thing. Either he's never played the game, or he's definitely alliance.
---
I'm leaning toward he has never/has played very little WoW.
---
I miss the old mass dispel graphic, it was huge and annoying tho it wont be in classic since it came out with pre BC patch.
---
Surely random normal dungeons are suppose to give you at least an indication of how and what the game is like at level cap with other players competing for an end goal hopefully communicating and working as a team.
---
So what your saying is I should grind all the way to M+10 just to be in the position to say the whole experience is not fun?
---
•	Levelling is monotonous 
---
•	PvP is bland
---
•	Communities are way down
---
•	Communication is toxic
---
•	Titan forging
---
•	Ilevel
---
•	Paid boost
---
Yeah.. no thanks buddy &amp; I shouldn't need to be in a elitist guild/mythic group of BFA babies to give my opinion either.
---
Ive never understood the appeal of corpse camping or killing people who cant fight back like low level players, but its part of the game.
---
Why not use scaling to make it so you can level wherever you want? 1-60 level any content any zone, make it so you could get all 60 levels just by one expansion, for instance, do all of northrend and you're at 60. Portals in major cities to start you there. Then 60-70 is current content, and at the next xpac scale that too, so 70 is permanently the cap.
---
Thanks, glad you like it! I did set up my own database. I am linking out to wowhead in a lot of places as I'm not looking to be a full WoW database, but nothing is being pulled externally.
---
I'm not a try hard, I just try real hard.
---
If they are alliance i kill them or try to at least. For the most part I keep to myself
---
The absurd number of mounts has made it much harder to really distinguish yourself.
---
Meanwhile in Classic, just having an epic mount will set you apart.
---
Me and my friends from high school are having our first Lan party since we graduated in 2010. Over the years we have all drifted in distance apart from each other. But have always kept our friendship strong in Azeroth. I haven't seen most of them since my wedding in 2014 so it's going to be one epic Tuesday at the end of August.
---
Ashenvale there's some low armor satyrs in a big circle about north middle of the map.
---
In easternish desolace level 38-40 there's a camp of orc casters who have very low armor, they also have a pet with them which makes sweeping strikes cleave/whirlwind burst insane, meaning you can easily kill them in 1-2 globals.
---
45-48 Feralas alllllllll the way to the north east corner there's a bunch of hippogriffs, they have low armor and low base damage but a lightning cast which you can easily interrupt, they also have a pretty decent loot table for nice raw vendor gold.
---
They designed some of the Alliance tech and there was a unit in WC2 called the Gnomish Submarine, but that's it basically.
---
/kick
---
 [http://capnbry.net/wow/gspots.php](http://capnbry.net/wow/gspots.php)
---
Does Vanish make you immune to being kicked from a group?
---
&gt; I mean, you see the content on raidfinder/normal the same way as you watch a video of someone doing it. Doesn't mean it actually feels satisfying to complete.
---
It really doesn't feel satisfying, which is why I don't bother raiding anymore.  But killing the same boss that I already killed in LFR with slightly different mechanics isn't satisfying either.  And rushing the gear treadmill to stay just ahead of LFR feels like a waste of time, since I could just wait a bit and see the boss in LFR anyway.
---
The whole modern system is incredibly demotivating when I used to spend most of an expansion being motivated to play and improve because of far-off content that I aspired to someday see.  Now it's just "wait a bit and get carried through LFR".
---
Turtles, kill the turtles up in northern alterac mtns. They are super awesome to grind and have really good loot tables.
---
Yes. Yes it would.
---
Some of the best World PVP skirmishes I've ever been a part of happened after ganking lowbies. Run through Darkshore - kill a few people on the way, next thing you know a handful of 60's show up and try to chase you off. 45 minutes later its a full on 20v20 brawl for a good hour.
---
There are no ethics of ganking low level characters, its totally at your own discretion, and if you do it - be prepared for the consequences that come from it.
---
Wow. 40 minutes and this hasn't been deleted yet? Mods are slacking today!
---
I been messing around with a Rogue after a long time of being convinced I wasn’t interested. Turns out it’s some of the most fun I’ve had on any vanilla class, even while solo leveling which is supposed to be a huge pain. So now I’m in this situation where I’m seriously considering Rogue main purely because of how much I enjoy it, knowing well I’m gonna be lost in a sea of tryhards who just wanna top the meters and ruin people’s days.
---
Hey I caught something under building custom equivalencies, you are missing "Health per 5 sec"
---
I think you are just not really grasping SCALE.
---
WoW had 4 - 5 million subs within the first year after launch. So that's 4 million other people who could have made a post like yours this morning. Lets say 50% of those accounts were banned (I can guarantee you it's nowhere near that high). That's still 2 million.
---
Let's say of those 2 million, only 10% have an active sub and opted in for classic beta (200,000 people).
---
If they let 10,000 people into beta -- and ONLY invite people who played in the first year of WoW like you -- you would still only have a 5% chance of getting an invite.
---
This does not take into account two things: 1) people who subbed when you did but have not let their account lapse (which everyone should be able to agree these people should get access first IF it isn't completely random); and 2) the tens of millions of people who played WoW but did not sub in the first year.
---
TL;DR ... you are not special. I don't mean this in a negative way. There are over 7 billion people on the planet. You are not special. :D
---
It'll release  before we know it! Hang in there. :D
---
yep, the community is going to be the same jokers, it only looks good now because it's beta.  all MMO betas are like that, went thru the same thing with heroes of the storm even.  it's definitely not going to be happy carebear land everyone is dreaming of, expect griefing and gatekeeping the likes of which you've never seen
---
Personally I’m gonna say that retail will probably be dead a few months after classic comes out. People are gonna see that that’s all streamers are playing and switch to classic. I could even see retail players being shamed in the future for playing the worse version. 
---
Players are just gonna go to where everyone else is.
---
^^ awesome :P
---
While the alliance is a much better faction in every way this is true for the alliance as well. You'll never have a good game outside of a premade generally speaking. It's the only think the horde and alliance have in common, because we're literally better in every other way.
---
These low effort memes need to stop.  For the good of us all.
---
Because I the horde is garbage
---
Have you watched a single interview where Ion talks about Classic? Dude's clearly fucking stoked for it.
---
Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian
---
On private servers or beta?
---
Why play a human when you already play one in real life?
---
Camping them is boring, but if they happen to be in my path they usually get a free corpse run
---
all the while calling you "lock this" or "lock that"
---
I can only speak for myself - I always tried to avoid CTRL+number (at least 1 and 2) binds, because the way I need to move my hand to press CTRL+1 feels very weird and uncomfortable. But if you can do it without probs, more power to you! I wish I could
---
It's World of WARcraft. No ethics in war.
---
But camping a player is bad.
---
I tend to leave lowbies alone myself
---
As with most problems in Vanilla, communication is key. While you're heading to the dungeon, figure out who the closest two are and directly message them asking to meet you at the dungeon to get summons going. Some will want to continue whatever they're doing until you pester them, some legitimately didn't notice you &amp; the second party member were waiting on them to start summons, etc. Most of the time I ran into this problem, it was when we just assumed others would head to the dungeon, or didn't specifically ask individuals to come help out.
---
Maining my main class, druid, resto druid.  
---
Primary alt will be different, not sure if I want to go mage or priest.  Leaning toward priest today, but tomorrow may be mage.  (In vanilla, primary alt was warrior.)  Either way, it will start as my banker until I am ready to level it.
---
I was an altoholic and by the end of BC, had one of each class.
---
Shaman - Lack of consistent damage. 
---
I'd play it and love every spec, but I know I'm either not doing enough consistent damage or I'm going OOM. Either way, the lack of oomph makes it unplayable for me.
---
Yes. Because i prob have 2 maby even 3 friends in the group otherwise i woulndt even do a dungeon. So you have no kick mayority. Pull faster meatshield
---
&gt;Well considering how we’re going to be a few weeks into a new raid tier, 
---
Blizzard seems to be scheduling Classic release to avoid that.
---
8.2 is going to be out in a few weeks. By the time Classic arrives, the raid tier will be 2 months old.
---
Sorry but if Classic gets a few million subs Blizz will jump all over future classic expansions. It's just the way it will all pan out once they realize they have a cash cow.
---
I aggree. The best time for a level squish would be in a new expasion (likelly in the new expansion's pre patch)
---
I think it's pretty simple... I'll use an very simple analogy that can be applied to pretty much everything...
---
Classic had a very tiny amount of candies, and finding one was INCREDIBLE.
---
TBC had few, too. Same. Then came Wotlk. Blizzard was reaching its all time high. 
---
This expansion featured the best villain so far, one everyone came to love since warcraft 3. They knew people loved candies. People were starting to wonder why their characters were still "weary travelers" after all of those epic adventures. 
---
Blizzard went "Hold my beer"
---
You are now one of the 25 (40?) CHAMPIONS OF AZEROTH, the best of the best. Candies are EVERYWHERE. Everything is purple. Quests give a ton of gold. Dungeons with epic good-looking gear were extremely accessible.
---
Naturally, WoW's population went crazy, they loved it. They ate candy like crazy, they have great memories of this expansion. Their craving was satisfied. 
---
Then... 5 expansions later... We're just fat pigs being forcefully fed candies.
---
So it seems to be “if there’s something in the game that I’m not inclined to take advantage of, it’s an exploit” is the view of people now.
---
Kill anything that moves, corpse camping is boring but if I keep seeing the same person ill kill it.
---
Looks great but one minor thing is the lack of love for the armory
---
summoning really shows its worth when a group member drops party mid raid/dungeon and a new is found. it could take 20 minutes or more waiting for that new member to make their way to the dungeon. that being said.
---
We know how to tweak it, I don't know who had said otherwise. 
---
The entire theme is a recreation of the old website. We wouldn't be able to lighten the black without editing the base image which wouldn't be true to the original website, and I don't believe it would make that much of a difference. 
---
The spacing we've discussed changing, and had created and demonstrated it in the test subreddit. We decided to keep the original spacing, though I can't remember the reasoning. I agree that it is tedious to navigate on small monitors - though I'm always on 27" plus monitors so it's not something I think about.

#**[NA] [A] [PVP][CST] &lt;Hurricane&gt; Hardcore WPvP (Semi-Hardcore Raiding)**
---
___
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you’re unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don’ts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE, 1 City, from 7-10pm CST. Will likely fall between Sundays and Thursdays. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can’t roll on the bindings. In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for city raid attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit.
---
* A tight-knit group, decimating the horde every week 
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won’t stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes.
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who’s friendly, willing to learn, patient, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla – you’re welcome, and you’re wanted.

it's a custom channel named world, no reason why it shouldn't work
---
Game studios who release various different games struggle with an unfortunate aspect of game development: once the people they hire to do a thing are done, they either have to be reassigned to do something useful or let go. 
---
My theory here is that Blizzard has a longstanding culture of keeping their good talent in-house. They can either use those artists/modelers or they fire them and so every expansion gets a bunch of new assets. I'd further assume that it's fairly easy to justify the expense of keeping these people in-house, since the one thing that every WoW fan will agree on is that the art is great.
---
We need an official joke race
---
/punt
---
It really doesn't, unless you mean raiding 5 hours a week in two sessions with a guild is no-lifing, because most mythic guilds are 2-3 day raiding guilds. If WoW is your main-game, it's really not a lot of time. 
---
Theres lots of content in vanilla, sure. The levelling definitely takes up the majority of that content for casual players as its flexible, but it isn't really engaging or challenging - its just time consuming.
---
Do you really want to play with your friends? Then either you join them, or convince them to change just to play "prettier" characters. Beyond any other reason that may have been listed here, i think this is the most important decision you need to make.
---
Some people like the idea of the Horde being the underdogs, once slaves risen up to build their own nation.
---
&gt;what races/classes should I avoid simply because they are really difficult to pick up? 
---
All of them are easy enough for a beginner to pick up. 
---
&gt;Also what may be easiest for me to roll? 
---
Paladin. But it's boring, so I would suggest something else. 
---
&gt;Any other advice as far as addons and the like would be great. 
---
If you get stuck on quests or whatever, you can search on [this page](https://classic.wowhead.com/) and find a lot of info.

Lots of dope screenshots, last one was stellar! :D
---
LOLOLOL man did this just hit home. I haven't been playing wow much lately. Honestly just waiting for 8.2 and then when classic hit i'm jumping off the retail ship. But i have made sure to do my one transmog run every week to get the last piece of gear for the set i have been working on. Well it dropped last night after 6 weeks of running the same raid. And i felt nothing, not excitement. Just nothing.
---
So by lore they have been in the game since WC2 so it isn't outlandish that they are in WoW. But i mean i agree death to all alliance. LOK'TAR OGAR!

---
&gt; *You are 25 year or older?* 
---
&gt; *You have a family and maybe even children?*
---
&gt; *You have a full-time job or at least something that consumes 40h / week to earn that sweet euro? But you definitely want to spent some time in WoW?*
---
&gt; If the answer is mostly **"HELL YEAH!"** on the above questions, **read on, this might be the guild for you.**
---
**Guild Info:**
---
&gt; We are a guild for people who have other priorities in life than WoW but still want to have fun and sometimes raid, PvP, etc. You don't have any obligations with us. No required attendance.
---
&gt; KEWLDOWN is a guild where you as a person are respected. We will be serious though, if we go raid and reserve 3 hours of our/your time, we will not be wasting that time! **There will be strict raiding rules.**
---
&gt; If you are looking for server first kills, you are at the wrong address.
---
**What can we offer you:**
---
&gt; A friendly environment of mature people
---
&gt; PvE raids at a good steady pace, like a turtle - slow but steady
---
&gt; World PvP &amp; battlegrounds ad-hoc on non-raid days
---
**Loot System:**
---
&gt; We will run with EPGP because it seems to be the most transparant and fair to all raiders. All rules will be clear upfront, this way we will try to avoid that loot is a topic to talk about.
---
**What do we expect from you:**
---
&gt; We are here to have fun, help each other out and reach goals together. Once we go into raids we expect that you are ready and prepared. Players who show up frequently to raids and always come prepared with consumables will be given priority for raid slots.

ok lemme poke around today.  I discussed this in some depth on mmo-c at the time, it was in late 2016 iirc.
---
It was faster to just summon everyone.
---
Hell yeah brother!
---
Decursive was a popular addon on WoW's release that trivialized healing.  It programmed your Remove Curse, Cleanse, etc. button so you could spam it and it would automatically target and dispel members of your raid.  It also automatically cancelled your healing spell to save mana if the target health wasn't low.  Blizzard patched the LUA code to specifically break this addon's functionality.
---
However, Blizzard has been inconsistent in their enforcement of addons designed to trivialize gameplay.
---
In WotLK, there was an addon that would paint visual indicators on your screen where boss attacks would land before the boss' spell went off.  This especially trivalized the heroic Professor Putricide encounter.  Blizzard broke this addon's functionality in response.  However, you saw the same functionality become incorporated boss addons in later expansions and it has not been removed.  WoD's Hellfire Citadel boss addons had indicators where to absorb mythic Krosus' splashes or mythic Archimonde's lazer matrix.  Many encounters in Legion's Tomb of Soakgeras were made tremendously easier thanks to addons assigning and directing people to soak boss attacks.
---
I personally would like to see the capabilities of boss addons reduced and encounters made more forgiving in response.  I think it'll make for a better raid dynamic to have player mistakes result in healers needing to scramble and burn through mana rather than mythic mechanics instantly killing players and prompting a reset of the fight.
---
&gt;My opinion: pandas lol. As much as we love it now, people back then hated the new panda thing. It felt childish and not warcraft like.
---
Personally I agree. The chinese art style is not for everybody but most importantly the expansion was just full blown goofy. The dungeons full of stupid ass gimmicks (can I just play my class for a minute without having to roll kegs around or swing a hammer or do other stuff that screams "the base game is boring, try this stupid shit here!") which was especially horrible for Challenge Mode (buggy Kegs etc pp). And the humor was just eye-rollingly awful. Me gonna ook you in the dooker? Really? HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA BLIZZARD HAHAHAHA SO FUNNY OMG jesus christ lord, whoever thought basing an entire expansion on stupid ass jokes and dumb gimmicks was a great idea.
---
From what I've heard, the patch progression was very very popular, though. And it introduced M+ (challenge modes back then) which was something Dungeons needed to stay relevant throughout the absurd itemlvl inflation expansions came to provide. If only it weren't for the timer forcing you to rush/aoe through them rather than being able to take your time and enjoy the dungeon.
---
Like it would seriously hurt itemlvl progression if someone spent 5 hours in a dungeon because they're not the best players but get some loot at the end. It's not like it'd be free. If you're willing to spend 5 hours on a loot roll how the hell is that a problem?
---
Bit late
---
Peak wow for me was TBC, 25 man raids were just enough, and 10 man Kara was great for pugging.  
---
Kara was also an incredibly fun dungeon.
---
Epic flying mounts were hard to achieve, heroic dungeons were somewhat difficult, paladins could finally tank and horde actually got them.
---
Oh and arenas were introduced.
---
Ya just head to the dungeons and tell 2 others to meet you there. Make sure they confirm that they are coming and tell the rest to be ready in x amount of time for a summon
---
The reason you're not finding this information is because nobody knows. There's no way to know the resistances of most mobs without like, doing statistical analysis on combat log parses against that mob with a huge sample size and all possible variables controlled for.
---
Even the armor and damage per swing things are just approximations... or more precisely guesses. Hell, even *health* is an approximation because you can't see the health of non-friendly units in vanilla (this feature was added in I think WotLK).
---
&gt;have 2 maby even 3 friends
---
then why are you pugging instead of doing the run with your friends? xD
---
Don't you just run to IF at lvl one?
---
"Hello I would like to do the thing"
---
*Can't speak while shapeshifted."
---
I always headed to the instance.  But so many times the group disbanded because one asshole chose not to mobilize.
---
Leveling and all solo content at 60.
---
Yeah man, thats the one.  Looked sweet on my 19" flat screen CRT.
---
Perhaps horde who roll on PvE realms will have shorter wait times
---
Druid: will be forced into healer role instead of tank. (I loved it when TBC broke this barrier).
---
Imagine the following scenario:
---
You are at the entrance of an instance with 3 people and two others of your group are still on another continent.
---
Who would have to wait longer in that scenario? A Warlock or someone who's not a Warlock?
---
So hating to spend time waiting for others is something that actually speaks for and not against rolling Warlock! Because it means you actually can actively do something about it!
---
This was great! Thanks for sharing!
---
I know I'm usually not great about taking pictures or screenshots. Might look into getting an app that takes one automatically at a set interval.  I'm sure I'd have a ton of great shots and memories if I had done that &gt;10 years ago.
---
There's definitely merit to this
---
A lvl 5 can learn enchanting and disenchant anything you send to them.
---
I also want a new experience with classic. Played Mage In 2005 up until MoP. With a lot of breaks in between. I think I want to play a healer this time. But a PvP oriented healer. Or some kind special snowflake like Shadow Priest. So I would LOVE to be the guilds only SP. Because basically a guild only needs 1. I never played alliance and I am sure that lvling as alliance would be hard as fuck for me. Also... WotF is best.
---
Dps pulling before everyone is ready is a risk wiping. I'd rather let the dps die and learn than have everyone have to walk back to the dungeon.
---
I'd say that the first three or so months of Cata were quietly one of WoW's golden ages (for people who like difficult content that is fun to work through).
---
You need lvl 5 to pick up professions.
---
Who said anything about pugging.? YOU are the random not us.  Hence no kick mayority . Sure you can leave as healer or tank and get a new group quick. But we're making such good time with the quick pulls why do you want to leave xd
---
Either that or you level to 5 for disenchanting all (trashy) BoE you get on your main.
---
Flying mounts definitely looked cool, but I would not sacrifice mounts looking cool for no world pvp and lack of exploration and world immersion. Besides, you can add great looking "land" mounts, without the need to fly.
---
So yeah, in this hypothetical, I would not have implemented flying mounts at all.
---
No
---
mm, when you get to the point your gear is red, you're well past being nice to that person
---
My plan is creating a hunter with an obnoxious name on a PVP server, power level, get the tram flute from the Deeprun Rat Roundup quest and bind it to all my abilities and then kill everything while spamming "/laugh".

---
How focused are you going to be on leveling profs vs straight leveling to 60? Because if you are just powering to 60 i suggest going two gathering like mining/ skinning. This will help generate extra gold while leveling. If you are going slower and going to level up and level profs while you go. Defiantly go mining/engy. As people have stated previously engy is one of the best profs in the game.
---
Quality, I can't persuade all my old lot to play again, managed to get 2 of them out of 8. Enjoy mate, good times.

I said why I care.

I've mained tank too.

When the heals drops because of your maximum expressed authority, the group is now looking at you.
---
There will be hundreds of people spamming trade chat with everything from tailoring, leatherworking, blacksmithing and enchanting, to alchemy and just about everything else.

It's very common to find someone to craft your gear for you, and give them some gold to do it.

---
Yeah, you're right. I'm retarded and didn't notice the deleted comment, sorry.

Yeah but 4 melees + your pet is 5. 5 +x dmg is way better than +10% dmg on your pet which will miss lot aswell.

I'm right there with you. have been dead set on Shammy for months. Just so happened to try out a Rogue and am loving it. I love healing in raids but... stealthing around pick pocketing / sapping / stunning / gouging and spamming buttons just feels so good
---
Kind of just depends on how I feel that day and what I've got going on. I'll just be defensive and let others be until they Eff up, or red=dead if they're in my territory or contested territory.
---
You can view pservers from different points of view. 
---
If your point is to grasp the overall feeling of the classes and gameplay to decide what you want to play on official servers then it's pretty good. 
---
If you want to look thoroughly and compare it to the original 1.12 then there are going to be quite a lot of approximations and mismatches, especially in details.
---
I lost all the respectI had for myself when I had to specc Moonkin for the 3% buff, equip my healer gear and then had to poke the boss with my staff because I was oom. Never felt so humiliated in my entire life.
---
Because level scaling is cancer.
---
my dad is a GM, he will ban u
---
Phase 1 red = dead no matter the level. Come phase 2 I will only kill levels 48+ for honor.
---
I think you overestimate the abundance of tanks. ;)
---
As the Holy light intended.
---
But you can’t make your own water and take up 4 debuff slots. :(
---
I’ll just flat out say it in group chat.
---
How do You get gear then?
---
You can't, but an army of level 1 characters slowly taking him down with like 3% hit chance looks amazing
---
Yeah but Thanos actually does damage :p
---
Thanks, I'll get that fixed.
---
The random enchant gear is there, but I chose to hide it by default. When you're selecting an item, you can click the filter button in the top right corner and turn them on by checking "Random".
---
I've been back and forth on having them show by default. It's just pretty overwhelming in some cases and requires a lot of scrolling past greens if that's not what you're looking for.
---
&gt;you benighted troglodyte?!
---

---
Madseasonshow has a really good video on the whole AQ scepter chain and this is part of it.
---
Anything by yourself even in good gear is still pretty rough. 
---
Your life is incredibly expensive too. 
---
Having solid roles is nice - but you pay for it for sure. 
---
And this thread is “complain about something” 
---
So...go fuck yourself?
---
I mean kind of? It's not near as strong as cloak.
---
I forgot the best SM wing, what's wrong with me?
---
Are you sure that's correct and you're not coming from a very experienced/dedicated player perspective? Our guild had a decent amount of trouble with Heroic Emerald Nightmare. It took a bit to clear it. We got AOTC but w/e. We did 2-3 raiding nights a week, I think. I think we started on Mythic at one point but I was super out of steam by then.
---
The Mythic guilds I saw expected you to be very serious and generally didn't want people who were new or inexperienced in the game. I overall got the impression that Mythic raiding wasn't for casual players and I'm a casual player. So I figured I'd get into Heroic raiding and go from there. And that killed my interest in raiding in modern basically completely.
---
Like, the heroic guild is already more time commitment than I will be able to put into WoW Classic. Regular raid nights and having to try to grind higher ilvl gear on M+s or w/e, + the AP grind, all for raiding that you say doesn't even count. Like, where is the part where I'm supposed to start enjoying myself? Before Legion I had another guild and in that one nobody would ever show up on time.
---
All this drama or I can just go tank Deadmines in Vanilla with a warrior or summon some people for Razorfen Kraul on my lock and have a great time, no crazy time commitment or amazing skill required, just patience and care, and all at the ripe old leveling age of 21.
---
Most of the time people won’t camp you. They’ll kill you and run away but some people will just stay there and kill you. However sometimes you’ll be low level and get ganked for no reason. I’m not gonna play on a PvP server cause I don’t wanna deal with people being butts
---
You won't need lvl 5 right away. Let the shit your main sends you sit in bags / mailbox. Level it to 5 once you gave a spare 30-45 minutes like 2 weeks post-launch.
---
Red is dead man.
---
It ain't much but it's honest work!

---
yeah It smokes better too
---
Fewer.
---
Warlock, can't use dots in raid because of debuff limit so you spam 1 spell
---
At least we're not fucking Gnomes
---
I had two very different experiences with Cataclysm dungeons before they nerfed em.    
---
Prot Warrior they played exactly like end game wrath dungeons for me.  Didn't CC a damn thing and just AE'd everything down.  But I was also doing them with friends that I raided with so everyone was good at the game.    
---
My alt Disc Priest though, I only pugged cause I was the only Tank  and so if my friends wanted to do a dungeon then I was tanking it for them.  Pugging cata heroics as a healer was hella hard.  If the pug didn't CC then I was going to run out of Mana on that pull guaranteed and if they pulled another group without letting me drink it was wipe City and likely a vote kick for me.
---
I mean, retail only has 3 million subs at this point. I think the classic release will bring in at least twice that from people like me who stopped subbing a while back. I don't think retail will grab their interest. This game had around 15million subscribers at one point and now it's down to a fifth of that
---
Seems like a win/wn for all of you actually, even him
---
Level 5 for prefessions. You want Enchanting to D/E.
---
Yeah but rogues have to hit buttons and stuff which is distracting, ret pallies have like 30 seconds between each action.
---
&gt; I remember in Legion there was some weird thing with scaling where you'd end up with higher DPS at lower levels than later ones while leveling.
---
World PvP at your detriment, a 110 could easily take a 120 at launch.
---
&gt; I think world scaling overall is good for modern WoW but I don't know why they put that into expansions.
---
I disagree, I feel it further removed the RPG aspect of the game even if it did allow friends to play with each other.
---
You should also add dropping a summoning portal.
---
People don't like the seal fate build all of a sudden? News to me. I think I rolled that build and also 21/8/22 build. I never really played swords or combat with my Rogues in vanilla so I have no insight on that and I never played as a hemo rogue but that's probably what I would try this time if I decided on Rogue.
---
Why do you care? If the DPS is doing stupid shit, let them die.
---
If you're going for pure speed, 1-5 then getting imp is not worth it.
---
This is a fantastic point. A bit of frustration on the front end waiting for people in exchange for never having to be in a group without a Warlock.
---
Western Plaguelands, Azshara, Felwood
---
...USA...blown away...what else do I have to say?!? We didn’t start the fire!

I’m pretty sure everyone agrees on that being a shit system

---
The only thing missing is Improved Sprint... but best to Trinket and Potion to avoid further movement impairment IMO. There's also Engineering ftw. Perp is incredibly valuable for PvP imo. Same for Cold Blood and getting that huge Evis crit twice over, less you're going for Stuns which makes sense.
---
This, cause red=dead.
---
Nice pov! I will consider that
---
That's a good one, I might have to use that one haha
---
In raiding condition and even in dungeon: serpent sting waste a debuff slot because it's low dps (limited to 16) and isn't mana efficient.
---
Night Elves got +9 agility at level 60. You would not recruit a "great" (the topic is about good vs great) pve hunter who had a +7 str on his gloves instead of the +7 agi right? Playing dwarf is like having a +str enchant instead of agi.
---
Stone form is useless pn 95% of the raid boss and a good guild wouldn't rely on it.
---
This has been my opinion from the start. I'm firmly in the #NoChanges department when it comes to *mechanics* but I just don't understand why people wouldn't at least want *the option* to have the new models/animations/general aesthetic overhaul. The art doesn't have anything to do with the decline of the game, if anything it's what kept it afloat. And until BfA (or was it legion?) we even had the option to toggle the old player models on/off. This is literally a situation where we can have our cake and eat it too. 
---
And don't get me started on the barber (as it was originally in wrath, where it was literally a barber. No face/skin changing etc.)  
---
Like, I get why people don't want transmog. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I get it and I won't argue in favor of transmog here, but having the barber would only make sense imho. People keep saying that having the game feel  more like an RPG is one of the greatest things about classic. Being able to change your haircut sounds pretty RPG to me \*shrug\* 
---
But I've also heard someone describe the barber as a QoL feature and it being a "slippery slope" so who the fuck knows anymore
---
Thinking about to pay people gold to let me have the drops.
---
On a PvP server, Red = Dead  
---
You signed up to be on a PvP server, this is part of your choice. It builds up the hate for the opposing faction and increases the bond you have with your own faction.   
---
You also do not know if the player you're killing has or has not done the same... this lowbie character you're killing could be an alt...  
---
If you're getting camped, maybe it's time to go to a different zone or start an alt toon.  
---
Happens to us all. No issues.  
---
Lok'tar Ogar!

I swear if I see Asmongold's face one more time I'm going to fucking off myself

Oh I did not see that Super my bad! This is amazing, btw. I am already on my 3rd set for pre-bis atm lol.
---
I'd be more than okay with adds tho. I think you deserve it
---
Eew, don't wanna read all that :)... skimmed it.
---
Like I said, I know the chance is very slim, and I don't really expect to get in, but subbed anyway as there's still a small chance, even if 0.01% :).... fun to think about it for me. And I don't think I'm special sorry if it came off that way.
---
I just simply said I subbed cuz there's a super small chance I might get in, which still makes it exciting. The money is no big deal to me. And provided proof of me playing in vanilla as someone didn't believe me.
---
Everything is allowed but people have personal ethics that they follow. I don't kill lowbies usually and respect 1v1's, but I most certainly don't expect others to, or demand that they do.
---
That's correct, your analysis of the situation was perfect, well done.
---
I'd usually toss a flameshock on a passing lowbie, or something like that, but I'm not going to sit around and corpse camp them. Just remind them that they're on a PvP server and continue on my way. Sometimes you stand on top of the inn and kill their questgivers a few times, but nothing too crazy.
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE, 1 City, from 7-10pm CST. Will likely fall between Sundays and Thursdays. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can’t roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for city raid attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
* Communicative on Discord
---
Yes, starting WoW at Classic launch is IMO the perfect time.
---
Oh you're such a good boy aren't u YESSS U ARE THERES A GOOD BOYYYYYYYYY

Now start streaming and saying how great blizzard is, beta to follow.

This is something James May could say to Clarkson
---
Thank you this is exactly whT I was looking for
---
As long as you're not going to an area for the sole purpose of killing people who yield no honor, you're not doing anything wrong.
---
Yup, would increase my chances, probably, but won't.
---
Lmfao. God damn it. HE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. -\_-
---
You do know, it's more likely that the ret paladin is actually a good player? It's widely known, that the "meme specs" are bad in vanilla, anybody who seriously tries one of those, will put the work in to make it be as good as it can be and thus is a good player.
---
A memer won't have the endurance to even level their paladin to 60.
---
Not to mention things like Titanforged.
---
I got all my best gear from WQs and LFR instead of Heroic raids. Like yeah OK?
---
I don’t know the exact name but the quest that you need to put out the fires in MC is extremely desirable, and will get you Raid spots easier for MC. Can start it pre 60 and you will need/want to do it later anyways so get on it before 60. I believe it’s in azshara crater, from a water elemental. I’m at work now I’ll get the name later when I get home for you guys.
---
did i mention it was juicy as fuck?
---
You're over thinking this.
---
you sound like a silithid beetle (we we we)  
---
so all 3 of you just get blacklisted, what's the deal? the word is going to get out fast in /1
---
Not the vanguard that has kept lashing out at classic lovers over the past 8 years or so. Some people just really really like instant gratification and video games that don't require much more interaction than a button press here or there.
---
It's not for me, it's not for you, but somewhere out there there are a couple minion people who enjoy this (to us) mundane shit. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Asking the real questions
---
Reserving is legit when the player has already run the dungeon countless times and has one single bis left and therefore doesn´t roll need on anything else. Joining such a run can be great to secure gear for yourself. 
---
Reserving is cancer when players do it out of greed.
---
this isn't nearly always true, but if it's struggling your group then use words.
---
tanks with God complexes can enjoy being triggered all of the time with the wave of retail players.
---
EZ Kick
---
Was a rogue in vanilla and was the only dagger spec rogue (We were not super competitive). But we had a rogue channel and we'd always joke around about me ambush critting a boss directly on pull and pulling agro and getting someone else killed by vanishing afterward. We mostly did this in ZG as we raided ZG for fun less so than progression. Good times were had.
---
What location is it?
---
In my personal experience as a healer it's always the tank that goes Leeroy because me angry melee, me no mana, me smash.
---
It definitely is, you're right. I was trying to look at it from both angles and figured the unfamiliarity was a double edged sword. I'm playing casually so the amount of time I'm either trying to figure quests out or hitting Thottbot would be increased meaning a longer time to 60, but on the other hand I do get to experience an entirely different half of the game.
---
I'm definitely settled on UD lock!
---
lol one of my co-workers plays and is excited but the rest would have no clue what we are talking about.  trying to figure out what I'm going to say to my boss when she asks me what I'm up to that week.  my times already been approved, and my boss is super cool but I may have to come up with something like "going to visit family!" but then she'll ask about how my family is the next week and i'll be like "well we all hit level 30"...
---
Although I have an adblocker installed for the more egregious websites out there, I switch it off on sites I use a lot or want to support and especially for 'one man band' sites like this.  Don't be afraid to stick a banner ad or two on there if it helps.
---
We had literally all of those things in excess in Vanilla. No worries.
---
thx
---
retri pala is all about +spell damage
---
these ppl trying to play warrior for the last 15 years have been doing it wrong the entire time
---
It doesn't matter how you distribute it, if there are 10 mages and 5 hunters, mages will take twice as long as hunters to gear up.
---
Nah dawg it’s less in this case :p
---
Bahaha
---
I don't think there's a way for them to reclaim those 7 million for retail
---
Do you want to PVP or PVE more? Because pve nelf will be better for the stealth level as well as highest agility gain of all races. Where as a dwarf is better against other rogues and warriors because you can drop bleeds, poisons and diseases off of you with stone form.
---
Cheers mate ill check it out!
---
I’m sorry but that was me back in the day. Join group make up a story why I can’t run there. Level until summon comes.
---
* Make sure all my regular responsibilities are taken care of: cleaning, dishes, laundry etc.  
---
* Meal-prep 26 lunch boxes, lunch and dinner for 13 days. No precious time wasted cooking.
---
* Will mainly be drinking water, but some sugar-free energy drinks will be purchased since I'm not too big on coffee. Fruit, veggies and nuts for snacks. (Carrots and selery with ranch dressing! &lt;3)
---
* Make sure I get outside and run for 30-60 minutes every day. 
---
I will probably average 12+ hours a day so it's extra important to keep it somewhat healthy! :)
---
\&gt;Quit sheeping my multishots
---
I like that xD
---
This is why you guild up right away and run with guildies. Seriously, the value of guilds in classic cannot be overstated for everything: PvP, professions, gearing, enchantments, consumables, all of it
---
too many tiers of gear, resulting in heroics becoming trivial. class balance and dungeon design minimizing the role of crowd control and unique abilities.
---
Wrath was great, but the seeds of WoW's future decline were planted during this expansion. They tried to right the ship during catacllysm -- the dungeons were certainly more challenging (at first) -- but the damage had been done to the community. They expected ease of content. And it didn't help that the lore turns in Cataclysm were ridiculous and stupid, and much of the old world (which was loved) was streamlined into ridiculous theme park rides.
---
The leveling experience 1-60 now is garbage. Flight points every 2 steps. Mounts at 20. Quests that practically play themselves. Gimicks everywhere.
---
Can I rebind shift to jist ability? I'm a fps player and I changed some keys already but I also need shift for some important ability like stealth for example.
---
Well, so far I have:  
---
Paladin:  22  
---
Druid: 16  
---
Hunter: 11  
---
Warrior:  11  
---
Warlock: 10  
---
I'm leaning toward Paladin, but it's close.  Something about being a giant mace-swinging terror of holy fury is just fun.   That's what makes it hard.  If Retribution paladin was viable in raiding, it'd be the easy winner for me.  
---
After that, I'm getting a little bored with the Druid leveling.  1-10 isn't that bad, but once you get bear form it's just "Moonfire, rejuvenate, bearform" and repeat.   I'm hoping getting cat form at 20 will remind me why I love the class.   The versatility of being able to stealth, heal, and eat a ton of damage is pretty appealing.  
---
Hunter was miserable 1-10, but a lot of fun once I got the pet.  Going to have to play it more.  
---
Warrior was miserable.  Period.  But I know they don't shine until late game, so this method may be unfair to them.  Warrior is only in the running because I enjoy tanking from time to time, and they are the best at it.  
---
Warlock:  Feels overpowered from the beginning and has been a lot of fun.  This is another that would probably be my 1b to the Paladin's 1a if Affliction was viable in raids.  There's nothing quite like Dotting up a bunch of mobs, letting the voidwalker tank them, life tapping back to full mana while you drain their life away.   But then you get to a raid and you can only really cast shadowbolt.  
---
Did I help, or did I leave you just as confused as I am? :-P
---
Our Ret Paladin, with full consumes, often did less dps than our tanks lol.
---
I had a no needle no scalpel vasectomy, which has a very quick recovery period. There was no pain at all. I didn't even take any medication.
---
Yeah I was lucky enough to be able to pre-made through them, but I heard horror stories about PUGS for those dungeons. I was really glad I didn't have to deal with people raging on really hard fights and packs.
---
Why would you leave a group because the tank is teaching a hard lesson to one of the dps?
---
Candy, huh? Back in my day, we always called them cookies.
---
Fuck blood elves
---
Nope, ranged attacks can only miss.
---
Which is why reserving has a point. This way you can still invite classes that would roll on your item in case they don´t need it, instead of declining them.
---
This is a good suggestion
---
I've to admit, people leaving inside a dungeon after one wipe was there in classic too.
---
I remember one guy in WC who level up to 20 inside and then hearthstoned out leaving us
---
Yeah, I was super depressed about the nerfs they did to the heroics a week or two later. It kinda killed all the fun and my personal achievement about getting them all down and farming them was turning to nothing :(
---
Ethics in a game?  If the mechanics of the game allow it then it's ethical.
---
To me tryharding is for example using every consumable possible to be at the top of the meters and progress through content as smooth as possible. Learning everything there is about my class to be a better player etc.
---
You can be a tryhard without being a dick. 
---
If you do everything you can to perform well you are a tryhard and there is nothing wrong with that. Some people enjoy being good at the game.
---
Keep in mind that EVERYONE will be using Joana's guide
---
meaning all these areas will be super saturated with people. So more competition for quest mobs etc.
---
Id say if you are a tank, a healer, or have a premade group, then spamming dungeons is faster. If you're a solo dps, then either quest or grind away from the busy areas.
---
These remind me so much of pieces of ANSI art back in the BBS dial-up days. The resemblance of the style is striking. Were you ever active in the ansi scene in the 90's by any chance, op?
---
Yeah I loved SF rogue!!! I want to go swords for pve so I will probly miss out on perds blade for a while hence why I want to try a hemo spec, plus I was SF for ages so good to try something different
---
You can use invis pot in battle? Also do you know what the item/spell that causes incapicitate for a long time is? I saw Vurtne among others use in in world pvp.
---
Now my UI is complete as well. Thank you!
---
You should look up a spimp rotation, still a bit spammy though.
---
New raids usually open 2-3 weeks after the new patch drops and mythic drops 1 week after the raid opens. So the mythic difficulty is likely in a months time. Most non-hardcore (not 5-7 days a week) guilds take a month or two to get CE.
---
I can claim its garbo regardless, because that's what it is.
---
If an older version of the game is doing allot of things better - Its is indeed trash.
---
But go on tell me again how my opinion doesn't count because I don't farm mythics like you :)
---
I have seen level 60 paladin retri who absolute garbage for now 2 years and no matter if he works as hard as Esfand he will still do shit damage compared to a mediocre rogue
---
Excellent
---
Buy a new rig, 1-2k usd, and play from when I get home til I sleep Monday-Thursday, and another ~10 hours per day on Sat Sun until I hit level cap. Then tone it back and play like 4 hours Mon-Thurs and 6 hours Sat Sun, until I and my guild are ready to raid, at which point Mon Tues Thurs will be from when I get home, til raid ends (1am), and Wed Sat Sun will be optional days.
---
Time will be spent to cook decent food because I cannot do hot pockets. Also beer instead of soda.
---
That's pretty similar to what I rolled with in vanilla except I went camo over MOD, never bothered with ghostly strike and went 2/2 for exposed armor vs the extra poison percentage and maybe one or two other different choices. That's just a bit of preference though. I know klmh buddy Rogue I rolled with liked MOD and poisons more.
---
Same story as mine!
---
Do you think it's worth doing over just vendoring?
---
Why wouldn't an average guild look at you for raiding?  If you're able to show up consistently, and are a competent player, you'll get a spot.  These days even most mythic guilds are considered "casual" and there are a bunch in the top 50 that only raid 3 times a week.  Only the WF race really requires no life dedication, but there are a ton of guilds that a great and raid casually.
---
With all things, there are baby steps.  Going from zero experience to a top Mythic guild probably won't happen, but it's very easy to get a spot in a heroic guild, gear up, get some raid XP and move up to a better guild.
---
Much scarier.  Stiches is a massive abomination patrolling the road.  Mor'ladim looks a lot like all the other skeletons round there and seems to patrol randomly.
---
I think evasion is increase your dodge against all incoming melee attacks by x%
---
Yeah I’ll be solo and I have a full time job and dedicating like 2-4 hours a day during the week and the weekends can vary from 0-24 hours of playtime so I am planning to be pretty far behind the pack of the people rushing to 60 
---
I just wanna make sure to use my time playing as efficiently as possible since I am no longer a teenager with unlimited time to game :(
---
If they do classic+ it should be on a different server. Classic must stay classic.
---
BFA only has 1.7mil subs now. 25% of those are secondary accounts. At its peak BFA had 3.2 mil. 
---
Vanilla had a whole lot more subs
---
I think they can be Blocked... Otherwise only Misses matter for physical ranged attacks. You're kiting and CC game has to be very strong as a Hunter in PvP. It's the most fun and thoughtful class to PvP with though IMO. Don't forget that Feign Death makes the opponent lose target, and a Rogue loses his Combo Points when they lose target. Casters lose their target and cast when this happens too.
---
What a guy. Thank you. Enjoy gold.
---
Awesome, glad you're enjoying it!

Having to drink constantly and the ability to get two shot
---
Ah yes, the mini-game of kiting mobs back to your existing earth totem so you don't have to replace it.
---
This is a really solid answer. I appreciate it. I hadn't considered the possibility of an OB, and of course the name your character event will give them good data.
---
That is assuming he is the only one on the threat table. Often other party members will be on the threat table and letting the DPS die you now have 4 people to handle an unexpexted group. That is now a higher risk of wiping.
---
it was changed way later in I think wrath. It is NOT safe to PW:shield.
---
It would probably just be PVE and PVP playable content that's made, not trying to pull any newer races.
---
Also, you can't ask that and not ask the same for Draenei lol
---
Yes, everyone will be starting from zero so it'll be the most fair time for you to join.
---
Of course, people that already played will be ahead of you, but I can't think of a better time for a new player to join.
---
&gt; World scaling is not a mistake at all. It allows friends to play with each other who otherwise wouldn't be able to due to level disparity. It allows you to visit zones at different levels and finish zones without outleveling them.
---
That was more a problem though of inflated exp gains. Instead of continuous world scaling, Blizz could have instead widened the level ranges of zones instead (make a 10-20 zone a 10-25 for instance while giving appropriate exp rewards). That way they could still keep the RPG aspect of getting stronger by leveling while allowing you to finish a zones story.
---
I agree that not being able to play with friends is an issue but I don't think world scaling is the correct solution in the long run. Me and my friend being at 2 different levels but face the same content equally does not feel good from an RPG standpoint.
---
Have you seen the love/hate between OSRS and RS3. I think it’s great to a certain point where people take it way to serious.
---
I suppose if you move fast enough while stealthed, you don't need improved stealth. There are boots out there that improve stealth too. That's actually a really good point!
---
Its not only about size. Its also about the kind of population you ask that can alter results. 800 participants in mixed high/low income area is different than 10000 participants in a high income  area when it comes to a lot of questions for example. Homogenous vs heterogenous population.
---
Is this true? hahaha
---
So awesome! Now I’m off to burn the next hour or so playing with your new toy.
---
true :(
---
oh hello.
---
because I don't like it.
---
theae players are typically hard to tolerate and unwilling to offer help without toxicity.
---
a newer hunter pulls a mob and they see it as a personal attack because their ego is absolutely fucked.
---
what's the problem? I can either keep the DPS alive while the tank sits off to the side waiting to realize he's not actually needed in Shadowfang Keep, or we just drop group and find a new tank.
---
Tank even gets another shot at finding a group that will respect him so everyone wins.
---
No, you should not shield warriors. Unless blizz would make a change to how it was in 1.12. But I don't think they will. So no shield for warriors. Best to just heal and only shield as a last resort to prevent wipes.
---
Would love classic +, so disappointing that some specs are just stuck being meme specs.
---
I'm playing a 40 mage in the beta right now. I'd say only about 1/3 of my dungeon runs involve sheeping more than a few mobs. Maybe it's because people are covered head to toe in BIS gear, but I've found most groups prefer sheeping only when necessary in order to make the run faster. Since the tank is usually in no trouble dying its just faster to DoT all the mobs and then focus fire on the tanks target.
---
R.I.P.
---
I never knew this person. But I'm sure he was a good human bean.
---
My new main (hunter) will be a different  but I think if I level an alt with my wife (probably not atleast 6 months-year after launch, she's working on her masters) I will level my old main (priest).   However, It will likely depend on what she wants to play.  If she wants to heal (which I doubt) then I would go something other than a priest.
---
I just did some napkin math. From [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24597/furious-howl) we have that howl adds 50 damage per 10 seconds per person. 
---
For one person that gives 50dmg/10s = 5dps per person, or 25 dps gain if 5 targets get the buff. I guess critical strikes should increase this but it will be reduced by armor, glancing blows and misses. Is a cat's 10% dmg over a wolf worth more than 25dps? I have no idea but I think it would be pretty close. Probably not game breaking either way.
---
This is insanely amazing. The ONLY suggestion (which could prove tedious) would be a total stat calculator that factored your primary stats for your spec. So for rogues XX agi = XX crit and XX AP. 
---
The site is absolutely amazing regardless and I would definitely donate if you had it set up. But adding a total stat calculator and potentially a talent option would be incredible. An all-in-one site that I’m sure tens of thousands would use
---
I almost always found myself being the only other person besides the warlock to head for the instance when a group formed.  Everyone just assumed that at least two other people would go there first and they could just keep on questing/mining/gathering herbs in the meantime. Then they all act shocked when no summons is available because 3 of them all decided to do it. Lazy bastards.
---
And then you respec holy or disc and nobody needs a healer just LFM Tank and DD
---
In vanilla/classic can you heal 5-mans in shadow. I was thinking of doing something similar but trying to mitigate respec costs by doing all my pvp over a few weeks (but I'd want to do 5-mans and stuff) and raiding a different few weeks.
---
You didn't have to make up a story.  They all understood you didn't care about their time and were lazy.
---
If you aren't Horde 4 life then please go play alliance.
---
No real ethics. Red = Dead. I will one shot a lowbie if I am passing through but not camp them unless I know it's a person I dislike. Not because of ethics but because it's a waste of time.
---
Vashj'ir *was* fucking incredible. Fantastic to play in and gloriously beautiful. And almost everyone hated it so much that Blizzard not only swore off making underwater zones ever again, but *entirely removed the Vashj'ir archaeology* (was it naga?) from the game. *Forever*.
---
Yes, I'm bitter. That said, the next patch is taking us underwater, right?
---
Lol that Gif. Love it. Happy Hunting :)

We are an up-and-coming guild quickly filling our ranks. We have extensive goals to be one of the top guilds on the server and will always be current on content. We fully expect to be ready to raid within a 2-3 week time frame from launch. We're looking for casual players as well has those as hardcore as us alike.
---
🔷 💢 **Raid information** 💢 🔷
---
Schedule: Tuesday and Thursday 20:15-00:15 CST (Primary Raid Days)
---
Sunday 20:15-0015 CST (20-man and Onyxia if necessary)
---
Loot system: We will be using a silent DKP system with a weekly decay to discourage hoarding while still allowing you to buy that minor upgrade and still be able to compete for the items you really want.
---
🔷 💢 **Role Availability** 💢 🔷
---
Druid (Resto):             Open

🔷 💢 **What we expect from you** 💢 🔷
---
We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.
---
🔷 💢 **How to join** 💢 🔷
---
Please follow the link below to join our Discord where you will be presented with a link to our brief application. Once that's completed, you will be contacted by an officer.

There's a few ways to power level. One is to invite a high level to your group, and go into a level appropriate dungeon. Have them pull everything and leave group, they'll still be stuck in the instance for 1 min before getting kicked. They kill everything, you get tons of XP.
---
The second is for open world, you just tag mobs and have the high level player kill them for you. You won't get the normal XP reduction, since they aren't in your party.
---
Mage AoE grinding is also extremely fast, especially if you can do it on a twink where you get MP5/frost damage/spell damage gear to reduce downtime and mana use. It requires you to have a less popular server though, because it's very vulnerable to ganks and has huge dropoffs once you start dealing with competition.
---
thanks, couldn't remember when that got fixed.
---
Gnomes are 90% of the reason I play horde.  Kill the gnomes!
---
As a tank if a DPS pulls a group unexpextedly I just tank it. :)
---
I like it for leveling
---
Thanks! 1 less person to compete with.
---
In that case id say follow joana's until you meet a place where there's lots of people, and then just grind something nearby (which will give you some gold as well).
---
My understanding of Classic+ would be "more content without invalidating any of the existing content".
---
Basically like it was the Case with Dire Maul, ZG, AQ and Naxx.
---
I don't think that adding blood-elves would violate this understanding of Classic+ but I think a lot of people wouldn't want to ruin their perception of what the horde is.
---
It is true, but to be fair he had a lot of competition getting gear pieces over fury warriors and rogues and it was hard to justify him getting those pieces. Eventually he got really well geared, even Sulfuras, and proved us wrong by doing a little more dps than the tanks.
---
Go disc
---
Nonsense, Kungen tanks all!!!
---
Combine your friends to do the same! Everyone take the second week of thanks!
---
Gosh, you and your expectations. I bet you'd expect a rogue to dps instead of playing with his naughty swirly ball in the corner as well, now wouldn't you?!
---
Honestly I free pretty bad when I kill lowbies so I don't usually do it
---
Shaman - totems being in one place with a radius, having to reapply them when the group is moving.
---
haha i guess i'm biased cos i was a druid at the time.  i had a lot of fun ganking people and zooming around in swim form
---
i have no idea about the next patch cos the last time i played was like the first month of cata!
---
Fuck that shit go shaman
---
I see a bar going down I make it go up.
---
I'd be pretty upset too if there was no Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RBG)
---
Yah, I'm expecting mechanics to be in the 1.12 state. 
---
Just couldn't remember if it was late vanilla or not when it changed, Other posted pointed out it was Wrath 3.1 that changed it. So that settles that.
---
There’s still spots, even if less
---
I always liked the sound of a mortal strike crit. It may still be the same (haven't played my warrior in a while), but it's nearly impossible to distinguish individual sounds anymore, it seems.
---
I’d say it’s fine in some games but that it absolutely destroys mmorpgs. Immersion, effort &amp; sense of achievement completely ruined by instant gratification :/

USA - East Coast

Alliance 
---
Seeking working professionals leveling and dungeon guild.  Helpful, friendly, weekend warriors.  
---
Been playing since beta Vanilla - Pandaria where lost interest.  Been classic playing private server off and on.   Cleared all vanilla context besides Naxx, All BC, All Lich King, most Cataclysm.  
---
Will be mage primary (herb, alch) Warrior 2nd.
---
If you've read the wow diary then it would confirm what you said about bliz. They try to keep talent as long as possible and actually give them reasonable bonuses. Or use to
---
Shit post
---
Yeah, you make it a guild policy for people to be at the entrance to the raid zone at start time, and tell them if they think they can't make it on time, then maybe they should log out there the night before.   
---
Otherwise you're basically shitting on your warlocks and telling them to farm shards while everyone else gets to do whatever they want because the warlocks will summon them.
---
This is seriously really, really good. Intuitive and player friendly, but also powerful and detailed for those of us who like to go way too far in depth with stuff like this. Thanks a lot for making this.
---
Well, since Classic is the real WoW...it's logical to start with. It is a real MMORPG.
---
Bfa, on the other hand, nobody knows what it is. What we do know, is that whatever it is, BfA is NOT an MMRPG. So, if you want to play an MMORPG (the best one ever created, hands down) play Classic.
---
This is the answer
---
That's one change I wouldn't mind having in Classic. Not being able to PWS Wars was incredibly frustrating on my disc/holy hybrid.
---
I hate how excited I am for classic. Its hurts me
---
Viper stinging priest spam makes up for it though
---
No you wouldn't. 
---
Lets say you get 10k honor and lets say ou need 10k to be placed in the top 32.70% bracket.
---
You are now in the top 32.70% bracket you get 5000 Ranking Points.
---
If they increase the honor gain of everyone by 20%, everyone will get more honor so in order to get to the top 32.70% bracket you need to get 12k honor. 
---
Now you do the samething as you did, but now 20% applies to you, you get 12k honor and you are in the 32.70% bracket again and gain 5000 Ranking Points.
---
Absolutely nothing changed what so ever.
---
theres sthing rly buggy with attackpower; tested it on rogue
---
What a noob! I have 6434 mounts.
---
Keep it goingggg
---
Why should it be hard? It’s old and dated content, nobody’s going to waste their time trying to aquire old gear for looks if it was hard, they have current xpac content to worry about.
---
Do whatever they want - put it on different servers and everyone that wants to play that garbage can transfer there :)
---
1.3 content should be 1/3 leveling content, 1/3 58-60 pre raid content, 1/3 (new raid tier) raid content imo. Aaaah memories, WoW elitests, awesome.
---
I cba to read your essay, but fully agree a lot of cata pve (as well as pvp) was much more fun and enjoyable to me than wotlk. I progressively raided the whole way through both, but it just didn’t have the same feeling defeating LK, when finally defeating DW, the dragon that killed you 20+ times in the world before you were finally able to defeat him. Also heroic raid runs felt more enjoyable and rewarding in cata than in wotlk, but maybe that was just me.
---
Later it will be. I don't think it will be worth it for early greens.
---
If I was smart I would start creating content while there is still hype
---
This was essentially my experience in vanilla too. Horde would usually push the alliance to the bridge and the turtle would start. From there alliance would backdoor summon or horde would wall climb behind the north bunker and summon people across the bridge breaking the turtle. Team fights usually went to the horde because chain lightening was super strong.
---
The real nightmare is if you are leveling alone as a warrior and you have the onyxia buff and full elixirs and this fat fuck comes out of nowhere and destroys your hopes and dreams
---
I do agree with everything you've said.
---
And while i've been that tank, the dps who fked up, and the healer, i have to give advantage to the tank honestly. Its his job to do those things and most people playing a tank picked that role so they could tank, and have the inherent leadership that comes with being a tank. I can't make excuses for someone who is just toxic even if mistakes have been made, but if the hunter is new like in your example wouldn't the tank telling him what he did wrong be beneficial for everyone?
---
I was 9 so I didn’t really think of it like that at the time.
---
I'm pretty sure they will close the Classic Beta much before the release of Classic just to net let people get burn before opening the server
---
In PvE it's very simple. Find a reputable guide for optimizing your DPS and make a few macros for your pet.
---
PvP is positioning above all else.
---
/u/Keekers making it rain, cheers my dude!
---
Mob taging wont be in classic afaik
---
I did not. But idk, its all stupid for me. Go do what you like People. Dont hate others becouse you dont like what they like.
---
And how easy it is for people to geT you out of stealth if they saw you stealth.
---
**Yes**.
---
Saw a streamer do it in beta, they need to do a town sell run.
---
Warlock summoned himself, hearthed to town, sold his trash then accepted his own summons.
---
Then They repeated for the other party members.
---
&gt; Why wouldn't an average guild look at you for raiding?
---
I mean average Mythic guild. You should ask them, I don't make up the rules.
---
&gt; Going from zero experience to a top Mythic guild probably won't happen, but it's very easy to get a spot in a heroic guild, gear up, get some raid XP and move up to a better guild.
---
See my other post. This is what I tried and my experience was so negative I quit the game and went to play Destiny instead.
---
Lock rocks!!
---
Nice dude! Looks great!
---
Well the one thing about his life we can say with certainty, he lead such a practical campaign
---
Yeah 100g per week is a stupidly high investment to play your class
---
I personally dont do it.
---
The DPS will never learn to not do stupid things, unless they're taught to not do stupid things. And learning the hard way makes it 100% certain that they'll remember the lesson.
---
I will give someone a pass if they're new, but if you've been playing this game for a while, and you're still the kind of idiot who pulls before the tank does, I'm gonna let your ass walk from that graveyard. Learn that your actions have consequences or keep dying. Hope the walk has some nice views.
---
😢
---
REE can’t be normal must be special
---
I’ve already told my coworkers about what I will be doing and I’ve informed them that I won’t be responding to emails or answering my phone. It will be like I was never even a real person.
---
You dont choose horde, the horde chooses you. If you have to be convinced to play horde stick with alliance
---
Like I said, anecdotal but I saw rogues doing this a lot
---
&gt; Of course, you are in your raiding guild since TBC and you know all of them personally. That’s a different thing, I will now talk about the “fresh starters”. Why should a tank farm several consumes a week to prepare for a raid which has not even the chance of having an upgrade for him? If you run raids just to make a “not optimal spec” decent, just take the better one and deal with it. If you know get the argument: “well in a guild you work together to achieve a goal for the team!” If you would want to achieve the goal for the Team, you would take the optimal spec “for the team”.
---
I'm having a hard time with this, maybe it's just me. Do people really raid just for the gear rewards? I always thought the reward was beating the boss and the feeling that you overcame this challenge. Gear was just the vehicle that drove this vagon, it was a means to an end. I never understood why it was important to e-peen flex in SW or ORG in your high level raiding gear.
---
Gun and bow sounds
---
Play what you want you don’t need anyone’s approval
---
Man, mage is cloth, have you ever seen an ambush + backstab on a mage? You are nearly dead and the rogue will kick your sheep. With no slows its game over in few seconds.
---
Tbh, most guilds will only use these on farm, not progression. And many players are also older and realize there’s other responsibilities in life, so they’ll understand if you can’t dedicate the time to collect them for farm content (and won’t penalize you for it).
---
If you get into a guild that penalizes you, then they are asshats and you should leave.
---
Mind control lowbie, give them Fort. Then dot them up with Devo Plague and Pain and watch them die.
---
I'm a psychopath, huh?
---
Are you me? I had those 3 at 60 as well. I plan on playing lock since I mained rogue. I also plan on leveling a pally to do some meme speccing.
---
When I raided mythic, I logged on in the week for 6 hours and raided two nights a week from 8-11, Ivl. I played probably 2 hours on the weekends to run M+ and maybe logged on for an hour or so every other day for world quests when they were relevant.
---
That's not hardcore, you could literally do all of what I did in one week in one day while also having a 9-5 job. 
---
People just blame being bad or inefficient with their time on the game, and its just hilariously untrue.
---
I wish
---
Turtles are fun but do have high HP and armor.  The syndicate guys nearby are humanoid- densely packed but many rogues/casters so they die way faster than the turtles.  But the turtles are very reliable and don't have any special abilities. 
---
I did a lot of turtle grinding on my warr (currently 54) and who knows, armor/hp may be off but turtles definitely take awhile to kill.  I usually get a few cheap consumes (trolls blood, cooking food, agility) and do my grinding session then to try to be as efficient as possible. 
---
Turtle  loot is very valuable at least.  Cooking food is good, grey items a ton that all sell for pretty well, and plenty of heavy leather
---
These look great, thanks for sharing!
---
I stared at the final product for like 30 minutes with bloodshot eyes making absolutely sure I'd not missed anything. I missed something.
---
I'd say a Dwarf Hunter can do level 5 in about 20 mins.
---
Rested
---
Yes, I did it all the time.  Just target yourself and throw up a portal.  You then have (I think) two minutes to hearth and do whatever you need to do before you have to click "accept"
---
I'm Batman.
---
Yah it's unfortunate, but just one more thing that seperates the good priests from bad ones.
---
it really doesnt matter tbh but i'm guessing anything without mana will be the easiest. perhaps paladin/shaman since you'll use your melee attacks for damage and mana for healing =\= good uptime.
---
tbh I think the difference will be neglectible, just go for a good looking bank alt :P
---
I watched a few videos before diving into hunter and I have a few things. Bear in mind I am currently only leve 13. 
---
-don’t clip autoshot. Time your abilities with autoshot 
---
-1-10 isn’t as hard as people say. You can kite and kill all the mobs without getting hit. Keep practicing kiting until you can do it like it’s muscle memory
---
-don’t worry about type of pet in the beginning. Pick whatever you like. I would though recommend reading up on what pet spells do and how they are trained and what animals are tamed with them. For example, I tamed a Scorpid in Durotar with bite 2. Learned that and then taught it to my raptor. 
---
-ALWAYS keep pet food on you.
---
-don’t worry too much about having the latest armor. You can dps in the earlier levels without it
---
-Do though to try and keep your bow/gun up to date. It’s your dps bread and butter
---
Thanks, much appreciated!
---
On the decimal issue, can you tell me what browser you're using? iOS or Android? I did a quick test on two devices here and seemed fine.
---
Agreed. If you're a tryhard in a guild of people who are also putting in effort, stick around. But staying in a guild where you routinely put in far more time and effort to progress than your guildmates is not tryhard, it's stupid (unless you genuinely don't care about progression, in which case, are you really tryhard?)
---
I had that problem; found a guild I liked and stuck with them for a very long time despite the lack of obvious progress. Eventually I started to really resent them because it seemed like the same 5 people preparing meticulously for raid every week were carrying the other 35 people who showed up with zero consumes and buffs and prep expecting to be carried.
---
It's also kinda pointless to be tryhard in a guild like that, because you can soak every world buff and buy every consume and lose it all on the first trash pull or boss if the rest of your guild dgaf to prepare properly and you wipe :P
---
Halo and Halo - Metal Covers. Mostly this. In Flames, Breaking Benjamin, A7X, and some other old shit that I likely won't use again. I'm all Gutterpunk/Synth, Classical, and Nintendo shit now. &gt;\_&gt;
---
For the First time of course! For the Second time yes. For the 6 week? I don't know anymore. If bosses keep on dropping 3-4 pieces for 40 people, I doubt you will feel excited after several weeks of the same content. It's not just about flexing it is also the progression of you character, even if i got 4 more stamina, it feels good somehow.
---
i bet we get server infos end of july / start of august
---
That's why your 2nd character is a warrior even if you want it to be your main.  Funneling gear from AH is a significant quality of life inprovement.
---
Some zones can be visited *much* earlier than Joana’s guide chooses to due to pathing reasons.
---
The reservations are server specific, so we will definately have the server list at character reservation time.
---
I mean, you can just watch a YouTube video too. Does that mean you experienced the content? 
---
If you think playing a game on the absolutely easiest game mode is satisfying and stimulating to you, I feel sorry for your incredibly basic existence.
---
lol Was gonna do the same but decided to edit the Draenei out
---
Tanks do this because when DPS pulls, it makes everyone’s job harder. If it takes them dying to teach them that lesson, so be it.
---
Is there anywhere you can look at those old screenshots of the day featured on the WoW website? I cant seem to find them anywhere.
---
Here is the rub, Nothing on alliance will play like your BC shaman but shaman in vanilla changed a lot going into BC. So they won’t be like your BC shaman either. I hate to see a boy in blue go red. 
---
Play a Priest or a Paladin on Alliance. 
---
If you like healing plus caster go priest. No chain lighting but shadow is still fun. Plus a very large heal tool kit.
---
If you like healing plus melee go Paladin. Reckoning is not the same as Wind Fury but it’s still as satisfying. Plus late game paladin healers are beasts. Double bubble and utility spells for days.
---
Warlock in raid 30 minutes before start time: 123 for summon

These are gorgeous. Amazing job!

MoP was some of the most fun I've ever had on my Mage. Yeah, the maintenance talent tier sucked but at least Invocation quickly became the front-runner among those them. 100% uptime Rune of Power was truly awful and the modern version is far better, fun even. It's too bad that everything else about the class got worse.
---
If you die you know your opponent was worthy. only a true champion can kill a rare elite.
---
Well putting it on another server is pretty obvious (:
---
The fact they nerfed the 5 man heroics in Cata still depresses me. I still can't believe they did it.
---
Someone: "Hey this heroic is hard and we can't do it reliably in a pug like we're used to"  
---
GC: "yes that's why it's called heroic"  
---
*Community and internal pressure intensify*  
---
GC: "Oh we nerfed them soz"
---
Gnomes have been around longer than Night Elves &amp; Tauren. They were present as far back as Warcraft 2, making them as iconic to the series as Trolls, Dwarves, Goblins etc.
---
Looks like a sensible spec for PvP that can also heal.
---
I would however advice against Improved Entangling Roots (you'll get kicked in PvP and can survive some pushback in open world PvE). And against heal-threat reducing talent.
---
Tell me about it! I left the game shortly after TBC. Started again a while ago, not to try and get beta but just to get a sub, which i need for classic and play a little Retail WoW while I wait.
---
It's all such a sad game now. I feel like i'm playing a solo game, I hardly see anyone around. It feels dead. Also it's such a mishmash of content from so many expansions. Very complicated and disjointed, so that it does not feel like a properly integrated game world designed for a smooth experience. I could go on but most here already know Retail WoW and all the usual issues better then I do.
---
It's only showing stat bonuses from items at the moment. Including base stats for race/level and calculated stats from str/agi/etc. is on my list of things to do.
---
Fuck it I'm making it a macro lol
---
There's always room for tranq shot x2.  You aren't suddenly benched come aq/nax

Sometimes I kill all, sometimes I don't. Really depends on day.
---
But if I see same faction player in fair 1v1, I won't help him. If he dies, he dies. Then I cheer the enemy and let him leave in peace.
---
Try hard aren’t selfless and don’t help others...all they care about is winning which means not playing with bad players.

Mmh yea but my point is, well at least for me, the blood elves have been a part of what the horde is for a very long time now. :/
---
Of course.
---
Thats a heated gamer
---
Thats a debuff, it gets knocked off very easily due to its short time on the boss resulting in a very low priority. Even when spamming it on trash it can sometimes not work.
---
Loken had his AoE that would one shot players for a good while after release, but once most of the group got it figured out it was forgiving in terms of DPS checks (as in a remember watching the tank/healer and occasionally one dps able to kill him while everyone on the floor watched). Thinking back, it was the hardest HC boss of release.
---
gundrak (unlucky chain impales on the healer) and the last boss of Old kingdom phasing and weak players dying are the only other heroics that we didn’t stomp on the first pull the week of release. Oh, and Oculus obviously but that was for an entirely different reason unrelated to normal gameplay.
---
Everyone in BFA is alone anyway. It's a single player game, who cares...
---
That's your prerogative.
---
Did you play other mmo's from the early 2000s? EQ/DAoC/Ultima were all influencers to the dev team for WoW at launch.   
---
The mmorpg's from the early 2000s stressed RPG elements within the game. The feeling of being emersed in a world and able to grow and find the potential for your character at every step. This took time, socializing, and development of knowledge of your character.  The "problem" with these older mmo's were how long it took to accomplish those goals for your character. WoW classic was that bridge for fans of the RPG genre, but also slightly less time required. The grind was real in those veteran mmorpgs, wow was still a grind, but had a lot of flair and quality of life changes that made for a very popular game.   
---
Modern MMORPGs (and future WoW expansions) took those qualities of life changes and turned them into the only features of the game, ultimately taking the RPG element out of the genre. "MMORPGs" became arcade style 3rd person experiences, replacing meaningful grind with meaningless time sinks.   
---
I say all that to say WoW classic is going to be really enjoyable. You'll experience character development at every step of the way, and will find enjoyment for sure. If you have limited time to play then I can't say for sure you'd enjoy it, let alone any MMORPG. I will say if you are a first time MMO player, wow is perfect. That's how WoW got so popular, I'd argue the majority of players were new MMO players, but wow also "killed" every mmo prior to launch too. Those quality of life changes were just needed and the majority of players wanted them in their previous mmo's but that's what made wow so attractive to gamers of all types. It perfectly balanced the beauty of an MMORPG and I have huge respect for that development team.   
---
TL;DR yes

I played on private server all the way to naxx, we cleared spider and were halfway thru with  plague when our new raid leader(2weeks of raids with us) decided that he wanted to be guild leader and started his own guild taking 3/4 of our core raiders with him... 
---
Never logged back into classic wow again on that server... still hyped for the blizzard version!
---
Including base stats and calculated stats from primary attributes is definitely on my list of things to do. Thanks for the feedback!
---
I suspect it will be a Runescape 3 / 2007scape deal. RS3 is still important to a lot of people and will continue to print money because MTX, but RS2007 beat it out in numbers over time. I suspect WoW will be largely the same, with a lot of money coming from Retail, but the playercount being higher in Classic (eventually).
---
I personally really like Blood Elves, to be honest I really like all the races in warcraft. But adding them would also mean Paladins and Shamans would not be exclusive to one faction.
---
Early Cata was just SO GOOD. The dungeons were so well tuned.
---
What early cata lacked were maxlevel versions of NM dungeons, leaving people who are too bad for heroics with like 3 dungeons to run. Other than that the gameplay experience was amazing.
---
They also introduced RBGs, which to me were amazing since I never liked Arenas but PvP without arena gear was just not possible. The expansion started out so well but then they caved to the easymode whiners and nerfed heroics to shit, which instantly caused me to cancel my sub. 
---
Same with flying in WoD. No flying was pretty good and with the continent actually designed around no flying you could easily get around (there were so many things like the whistle or the additional hearthstone and plenty of flight paths that really made getting around comfy).
---
It also opened up interesting things such as treasures (which are a total joke if you can fly straight to them) or brought back world pvp but alas the whiners wanted their flying and they got it... I cannot wait for classic.
---
&gt; Surely random normal dungeons are suppose to give you at least an indication of how and what the game is like at level cap
---
Wrong.  They give you an indication of what the dungeon is like, in a watered down brain-dead way.  But that is nothing like what end game content is like.
---
&gt;with other players competing for an end goal hopefully communicating and working as a team
---
That's not what the LFR and LFD tools are for.  They are for easy content that requires no communication or teamwork.  If you want that, join a guild or a community.  The server being a community died a long time ago.
---
&gt;Levelling is monotonous
---
No argument, but it has been insanely streamlined with each expansion since Vanilla, which was streamlined compared to the games that came before it.
---
&gt;PvP is bland
---
Same as it ever was.  You mentioned RBGs, but that's at max level and are queued for as a team, not an individual. 
---
&gt;Communities are way down
---
You didn't join one.  You joined a random group of people trying to mindlessly get through content that barely matters.
---
There are actually more ways to create and join Communities now then there has been since Wrath.  Turns out the game sucks as a single player experience.
---
&gt; Ilevel
---
Has been part of the game since TBC when it was called gear score.  It's just an indication of what gear you have, noting nefarious.
---
&gt;Titan forging ; Paid boost
---
Agreed, these are dumb.
---
&gt;Yeah.. no thanks buddy &amp; I shouldn't need to be in a elitist guild/mythic group of BFA babies to give my opinion either.
---
First, not all guilds or mythic groups are elitist, but by your all of your responses to people in this thread, I'd wager that you are.  "BFA Babies", see, you're the one being elitist.  Your opinion is valid, but at lease try something before you come to a sub-reddit for an entirely different game to bag on it.  
---
Happy karma farming.

Will Classic run on my particular potato?

I would think that on 8/13, when we get to reserve our character names, we get to first choose a server and then create/reserve a name on that server.  
---
I do not think we need any pre-release of server names.
---
With Black Rock Spire layout, leap of faith in vanilla would be.... interesting.
---
Luckily what I want to play, just so happens to align with the meta lol.
---
Warrior is really fast to level 5.  Pick a race that starts with 1h and shield.  Always fight two mobs at once so you have enough rage to heroic strike on every attack.  If you start getting low on health, kill both mobs.  Warrior regen is crazy high at low levels so you'll be back up to full health in no time.
---
What really sucks is that the game is so beautiful now in these newer expansions it just feels like wasted beauty.
---
no, shit game
---
What bothers me the most about leveling is I feel like I’m leveling up my gear, not my character.  Then once you hit 120, guess what, you have even more grinding to level up you necklace.
---
Shitty repost from yesterday’s top post, just copied and added a little flair. Downvote.
---
Generally summoning is done before the raids starts.
---
It was meant more of a meme joke. Obviously every age group played both factions. I guess my joke was in poor taste
---
Looks like an awesome solo/5 man build. Good for wpvp I’d say too
---
Disturbed, Godsmack, Rise Against, Papa Roach, Hoobastank and RATM more than anything else. Not even because I listened to them a bunch - because they were also in so many vanilla videos.
---
Cat form at 20 is a game changer. I just got it on my pserver druid and it definitely solidified druid as my main come Classic.
---
People who say Ragnaros and Ony will be dropped week 1 completely overestimate the servers.
---
Yeah, I believe we're off after Azshara in 8.2. Should be fun imo. :)
---
I think this will be very different come classic. World buffs are going to be much harder to collect because of cooldowns, very very high pop servers with only one prime time will increase purging and ganking at raids (dropping world buffs), and warriors have 1% more chance to miss/get dodged plus less damage on glancing resulting in less dps and rage. I think hunters will be much better than everybody else thinks in comparison to pservers. Maybe just wishful thinking
---
Below classic wowhead’s talent calculator, there is a section that shows you the max rank spells at whatever level you choose. So if you spend every talent point, you’ll see your max rank spells at 60
---
I came to post this same comment. I am by no means the best hunter, I know I have room to improve. But, I at least know how to control my pet, freezing trap + FD freezing trap, and do my cycles on autoshot + abilities. If you know those 3 things, you will look competent enough to not get yelled at.  
---
Until you get screamed at for rolling on hypnotic blade in SM when you ask 6 times if no one else needs it because it'd be an okay offhand for a few levels but you won't roll need on it if someone else actually wants it, but then everyone does the "pikachu" face when you win the need roll. But, I digress.  
---
Hunters are fun.
---
Yeah you need SSs for the raid?
---
How is it frustrating to have to use appropriate abilities at appropriate times..?
---
I blame a combination of class design and WoW's poor "3d combat" (example: Oculus) for the reason that some players hated Vashj'ir. Fighting in the open ocean as a melee was *terrible* unless you had something to pull the mob to you (death grip, heroic throw) or move you to them (feral leap, charge).
---
They could have easily remedied this by adding a melee "leeway", like tacking on a +5 yard attack range or something like that. 
---
Personally, I loved Vashj'ir, and I leveled through it as both ranged and a melee. There aren't many quests where you're fighting in the open sea anyway - most of it is on the ocean floor or caves.
---
Mage - Knowing that your class will eventually become garbo in TBC classic.
---
Gnome rogue.  Gnome warrior can only use 1handed mace at the start.  It's pretty terrible.
---
True, but they had barely any lore or backstory before they became a playable race in WoW. Before that there were only 2 units and a single building named after them.
---
Looks fine for PvP.
---
Unless you play druid of course... jk
---
I wouldnt bother selling leather on the AH, just vendor it.  When you get to heavy and above its good money.
---
Yea the shaman paladin divide is also something that I would like to keep :/
---
It's what I plan to do, going to find a guild which has a guild tailor and enchanter and keep my proffs for flasks and extra gold.
---
Where is the money from the AH coming from?
---
And we can see what a great long term decision it is to substitute your hardcore nerd fanbase with some volatile pop-culture idiots who will always flock to the new shit instead of sticking around.
---
You really made a great decision there, Blizzard. Boot (figuratively) the people that made you great for a quick buck off some people with a temporary interest in a game that had become great through long lasting hardcore fans.
---
Meanwhile I see that as hardcore—playing the right hero and all that. 
---
I see tryharding as like 3 smoke 2 flash entries on Site in silver csgo matches. 
---
It’s rolling into mc with full consumables when you’re the 12th guild on your faction to get into the instance. 
---
Tryharding is using tactics, skills, knowledge, that are above and beyond the competition to shut them down and win games. 
---
For instance, you may get called a try hard in the csgo situation, it basically means someone is mad you use utility to get the advantage vs peeking a disadvantageous corner and kpwinning the gun battle (or having a perfect route to beat the opposite awper to the mid sniping spot, etc.) 
---
Tryharding in WoW is using engineering in PvP, consumabling out for trivial content, skipping mob packs in 5 man’s. 
---
I dunno dots well enough to know what the try hard do.
---
Tryharding has a lot to do with relative skill, if you’re in silver in sc2 and you see 800apm marine splits, that’s a try hard. If you’re in master 1 and you see that, it’s just people playing the game.
---
Blackrock Depths is the coolest dive bar (and it even actually has one in the game!)
---
Vendor most of the leather unless it's uncommon or special. Otherwise you can definitely make money on AH with Herbalism. There's a market for everything.
---
Make an option that says what would be your next ideal dungeon to run based on best upgrade.
---
Hating on bfa in r/classicwow!? How original! Upvotedddd!!!
---
It’s already pretty fair if it’s your group &amp; you Rolf the ”rules” before, imho.
---
As they were back then only after guilds fell apart. For the vast majority of time they were not in.
---
joke's on you, I'll just ice block and let other people deal with the chaos
---
He didn't mention cata dungeons specifically for this reason probably. 
---
Cata dungeons were a lot of fun outside of first part of grim batol (dragon thing felt like a waste of 5 minutes to me) and the underwater dungeon.
---
Honestly I think the issue with cata dungeon difficulty was the fact that there was so much spike unavoidable damage that made them to 'hard'. Mechanics weren't that difficult but I remember trying to heal those dungeons as a rest druid and had a really tough time on some of them while my holy paladin had no issue on it.
---
Also, leveling in WoW takes like 5 minutes so it's not exactly difficult to catch up with your friends
---
Yeah it's a really cool thing about Classic in my opinion, that adds more identity to each faction and race, and some interesting PVP outcomes.
---
&gt;New raids usually open 2-3 weeks after the new patch drops and mythic drops 1 week after the raid opens.
---
Actually that generally does not happen, however they did confirm Azshara's Eternal Palace and Operation: Mechagon will open 2 weeks after patch drops
---
I am afraid that BfA realms will look like this for a VERY LONG time. At least until next expansion. 
---
And to be entirely honest...I don't the next expansion will improve the situation.
---
3 of these posts didnt even read what you said and are assuming the wrong thing.  He isn't talking about weaving on a single target.  Hes talking about your pet tanks one, you face tank another mob.  You shoot your pets target, then melee hit your target since they dont reset each others swing/shot timers.  It is worth it past 10 with a pet, not before.
---
Cool, I actually have no idea what that is but it sounds like I'd like it! Do you have any examples?
---
Oh yeah, In Flames were also on repeat back then.
---
Would do mining mats sell for more on AH? Would it be better to go mining/herb?
---
it goes out in /world and we is because i enclude you as a friend we just met =\]
---
but blacklist why? all jokes and sarcasm aside. you would have a problem with fast pulls no wipes? it might scare you a bit in the start especialy as a new tank or healer. we're nice guys (we as in my friends and the retail guild thats returning with us to classic). we explain stuff if needed , there will be auto sheeps , other cc's , off healing by me the sp while also saving mana for that slight oom change of the healer etc etc.  the main problem is ppl be scared... you dont need a full mana bar to heal, you need enough mana for that pack. you dont need a full hp bar to pull, you need enough hp and cd's to survive it.   
---
ofc when the stuff above doesnt happens or they cant kite or have aggro reset or combat reset cd's... its time to leave, but fast pulls when tank isnt full hp or healer isnt full mana isnt a bad thing percee.
---
I mean, if it effects you, it's there for show. Also outfitter or comparable addons were in insanely popular
---
Personal loot, no master loot, cross servers, Ilvl, paid boosts, titan forging, mob scaling, demon hunters, boring pvp.
---
Keep your modern game I'll stick with classic thanks 👍
---
The thing is 90% of paladins are going to be ret paladins til about 6 months in 
---
Then there are gonna be lots of holy paladins raiding, but still most the paladin population will be ret paladins leveling and pvping
---
Wow, this is so cool dude! Awesome job!
---
Because people want to blindly use the same abilities for every situation without thinking at all.
---
I just don’t really like any of the other classes unfortunately.
---
Mage. Mana management. It's usually not too bad, but on long fights when you go OOM you feel so useless and helpless. There is only so much you can get from consumables and Evoc to keep going. Eventually you run out.
---
He wants you, the guy in question, to check out the previous official forum posts by blues.
---
Of course they *can* be, but OP is asking for a suggested level to go to each zone.  If it's the most optimal route for a speed leveler, then it's more than likely an optimal route for a normal person as well.
---
Dude you should let yourself put ads in at least to cover the expenses. If the website is as valuable as it appears people won't mind.

Oh look, another ‘’BFA sucks, classic good’’ post, did you get r/classicwow and r/wow confused?
---
Problem with MoP is that it sucked until the .2 patch but many people quit before that happened.
---
I absolutely 100% support Blizzard continuing to balance classes, as long as they don't do an overhaul. Classic WoW witnessed class balance changes in every single patch. The true Classic experience would be to see that balancing work continue where it left off.
---
i was honestly having fun with BFA,  the raids are amazing.
---
ive been grinding for a heroic raid 400 ilvl weapon for weeks. not dropping thats okay il just keep grinding.
---
after a month or 2 with no drops ( and still okay with it RNG is RNG ) they upped the daily cache rewards and i got a 395 weapon from it. 5 Item levels lower then a heroic raid for doing 4 world quests.
---
the game is an actual joke rn
---
Ask a guard lol.
---
I did back in vanilla, hated too. I was also 16 and had no clue what the hell I was doing..
---
You forgot "don't enjoy Costa Rica as much due to wishing I was home participating in the launch"
---
Nope, you don't want to be power shifting as a healer just to manage threat. That is an enormous drain on Mana. Also, it requires you to be in melee range, affects your threat on one target while healing pulls threat on everything you are in combat with, and reduces your threat by 601 points, which is less than one heal worth of threat, even with downranking.
---
You sound fun to play with
---
Blood elves would never join Alliance. 
---
*Should* they join Horde in hypothetical Classic+ that'll probably never happen? Not sure if the question is well-posed. But, well, they make certain sense.
---
As much as I complained last time, same
---
Or you know, he’ll just chain poly you till fap expires...
---
Just keep an eye on the healer's mana.
---
I cant WAIT for world pvp. Literally my favorite part of the game. We didn't need achievments, rewards or nothing. It was just about having fun. Capital and region raids were my favorite part of WoW hands down.
---
 [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=7862](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=7862) and  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=7861](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=7861) are two of the quests. I can't recall the names of the other ones.
---
As the good Undead Priest I was always waiting for the Warlock to show up so I could help summon.
---
When you’re in a raid that’s true if you take a second and look at the ridiculous storm surrounding the boss. Individually though, there’s just no way I can go from retail shaman back to vanilla shaman and not be a bit sad about how it looks (I think shaman has the best visuals on retail) . I’ll likely be playing warlock, and I’m looking forward to the simpler casting animation for some things.
---
If you're good and know your class you'll set yourself apart and earn a spot in whatever you want to do.
---
Just because there's a lot of one class doesn't mean they're going to be good. Most are probably going to be average or even suck.
---
Then u have to walk, u get no sum😡
---
Remember when unlocking content or cool shit was the reward for doing content? Yeah. Good times.
---
Nope, just a typical shadow priest.

Can’t remember so maybe you could answer, is the group leader(the one who reserved the item) expected to put on ML when they get to the boss in question or did he/she just pray that these other cats in the group kept their word?

I honestly don't get the people who are aggressive against any sort of changes. As long as it's an option, why would you care if someone else has better player models or skyboxes?

No lifers with extra gold who want to level profs faster, I don't plan on being a super fast leveler, there will be people buying eventually.
---
Sounds more like they are afraid of competition and like being the "best" dps/tank/healer in the guild and/or require the admiration of their guildies. 
---
Imo the best place to be is in the middle. I like to be in guilds where I feel like there are people below and above me. This gives me a healthy sense of competition and if I ever get to the point where i feel like I'm the best it means i should move on. Unless of course I'm just in a guild to be casual, then who cares I guess.

Also i just realized you are probably using "tryhards" in a derogatory way, in which case I agree!

it was big in the mid-90s to decorate bulletin board systems (BBS) with nifty art that consisted of ANSI code. Countless "groups" made it their speciality and honestly many were amazing to look at, given the constraints they had to work with (sixteen colors, only the ansi blocks as brushes)
---
They would release their art in "packs", basically zipped archives with nfo files with information about their group and their members etc. [here](https://16colo.rs/pack/ice9503a/) is an example of the contents of an iCE release, one of the most respected groups in the scene back then.
---
definitely added like +5 str and +10 spirit

Have any specific ones you suggest? I’m sure there are a couple out there that work well, so just curious

True keeping the identity of the classic factions is very important, we don't want to see another muh genocide horde

Best part? Im sorry, but i fail to see the fun out of being one shotted by a retard lvl 60 hunter in hillsbrad field, to run back at my corpse to be insta killed by a lvl 60 paladin. Been playing this game since tbc and I have yet to kill a lowbie.

I am a solid Classic supporter. I found the fist 3-4 months of Legion really good...but that is ONLY because I played since Vanilla, and I lived through Cata, MoP and WoD (which all basically were huge failures for an MMO, regardless of MoP popularity in numbers).
---
Legion was entertaining enough (compared to Cata, MoP and WoD) and for the first 3-4 months, it was good. The addition of Mythic+ was a very good idea. Same for World Quests. And Artifacts Weapons. And Invasions. However, those additions were poorly implemented, either becoming a daily chore, either being too repetitive (regardless of the affixes being different, an M+ player would very fast get bored) either rewarding too much gold for zero effort.
---
So, the only reason I am giving Legion (not entirely, but only for the first 3-4 months) some credit, it is because it was better than Cata, or MoP or WoD. Was still shit for an MMORPG, don't get me wrong. It's just that was a less of a shit compared to previous 3 expansions.

&gt; Even once you get to harder content the general "fuck you, got mine" attitude prevails.

Literally the opposite, Mythic guilds don't have that attitude at all, because it doesn't work.
---
Its not just that it would be tough, the big reason why skinning was so efficient is it let you do something useful in the downtime in-between pulls while you're getting your Regen. But you won't need nearly as much downtime.
---
Skinning is extremely efficient to level in private servers which is why alot of guides recommend it. 
---
I'm not saying skinning is a problem, just that it's no longer the end all be all for efficiency that it use to be. It's only really the best for leatherworkers. You'll have plenty of vendor trash to sell so the small amount from skinning isn't super efficient and you may get more money from another profession or be able to use that time and bag space more efficiently
---
I know I used strong words before against skinning but that's because alot of people think it's the bees knees when it's just an "ok" profession in classic because of how the game works. It's not horrid, it's just only really useful to someone who would normally ignore professions or a leatherworker
---
Not a solution.
---
Launch will being players regardless.
---
I remember constant raids on XR as a Paladin. Always some guy yelling DK's, stop killing the NPC's :)
---
That's incredible and has saved me days of dev time as I had started working on something similar but inferior. Being able to create custom equivalency values is exactly what I wanted as for PVP the usual BiS lists are useless.

It's always been the same, roll a highly desirable class and fight for loot in raid or roll a non desirable class and fight for raid spots in the first place. I'd rather be one of 15 mages and have a chance to earn DKP than be the snowflake druid/hunter and basically never get picked over the guild leader's pocket team of best friends IRL.
---
It was disappointing how there wasn't 2 viable tanking classes for each faction. A class other than warrior that could tank dungeons and do off-tanking in raids.
---
That sub count was waaayyyy after Vanilla had come and gone. I don’t know what classic will look like the week of release, but after a month I am pretty sure the active player base won’t exceed retail, let alone double it. A lot of people will really love it and that is great.
---
Designing and releasing classic servers was a great idea for developing WoW in to its death cycle where new content finally ends and everything becomes repeating seasons of old expansions, but it isn’t the home-run for sub counts you seem to believe.

*laughs in Vanish*
---
Pugs were only horrible because these players never learned to play the game. Cata was full of people who started in WotlK and never properly learned how to play their class, use CC or interrupts.
---
Blizzard really needed maxlevel NM dungeons for these players but alas the only content these people got was heroic dungeons which demanded much more from them than they had to learn to get there (because WotlK leveling was just that easy)
---
Blizz really really really dropped the ball on wow. Who can really blame them, though? In a way everything they implemented were player demands. Many of which they refused to implement for a very long time until players talked them down. 
---
Who could have possibly foreseen the long term impact of freaking name changes (ninjaloot, change name, still get invited to groups) when there was no game at all that could have been used as reference?
---
They even tried to fix some of the worst offenders (early cata heroic difficulty, flying) but the community at that point was already full of 'the wrong kind of people' who put so much pressure on Blizzard to keep moving forward with the shitshow they accidentally created that Blizzard caved again and again. Now all these people are leaving and the actual hardcore fans of the original game are alienated from retail.
---
I hope classic either gets additional content a few years down the road or at least the feedback from it helps Blizzard realize again what made WoW so successful in the first place.

Maybe, but it can be a hard pill to swallow when you work on a toon for so long, only to get to that level and find yourself having trouble getting a raid spot...
---
He'd still be able to get a spot if he respec'd to heals, though, and if I was going horde, it would definitely be as undead.
---
Cause we notice. And we all pay $15 a month. 
---
Back when retail was a great game, one of the biggest most valid complaint against blizzard, one that we all said heralded a time when blizzard just looked at us as a money siphon, was reusing art assets. 
---
I don’t want to stare at another reskin of a previously existent set. 
---
Some tile sets, sure, but those assets and textures best be combined with new ones. 
---
I want new models, skins, and dungeon layouts. 
---
If I play retail, I’m running the same dungeons for an entire expansion, I’m running the same raid 1-3 times a week depending on where we are in the content cycle, I’m sitting in the same city. It gets boring. With the amount of money we pay them, and the length of time it already takes for new content, we better get new art consistently.
---
That said, I don’t like the railroady zones of wod and beyond, I prefer the zone design of classic - Wrath.
---
You know that during vanilla the sub count was far, far higher than BFA ever got right? Something like 8-10 million at it's peak.
---
I don't think keeping people from playing the game is the solution. The best way to handle it is to force players above a certain level to the primary layer to make sure that early lvl60s can't abuse the system.
---
I know the quests.. I asked if they confirmed Jintha'alor will be in at release..

I mean, I'm a fairly experienced player and played a lot as a kid, but I stopped playing the game from Cataclysm (Firelands) and started again in Legion and I didn't miss a beat, despite not needing to play too much. 
---
I was at university in my final year when. Legion launched and I managed to balance raiding with work experience and my study - I probably played 8 hours total in the week, and weekends varied- you could easily fit 8 hours of playtime in one night with a 9-5 job if you really wanted too.
---
Raiding does require a stable time commitment, you need atleast two nights a week, and a lot of those guilds exist. But IMO mythic+ suits your nees better, join a guild that focuses on it and dive into it - you can pick your difficulty and be very flexible with how often and how long you want to do it for. You progress as fast as you like while still doing challenging content. 
---
However, it sounds like you enjoy just playing an RPG - Which vanilla feels like much more than an MMO.
---
Eh, it’s normal
---
For 5 mans, very rarely. Since two others need to come too, most will make their way unless you get a last minute joiner (usually a tank enticed by "summon available"). This is Pserver experience, but I don't remember it being too much of a sore spot for me. I loved being a warlock and I loved people needing me.
---
Christ I was the shadow priest who kept pulling because "DONT BE A PUSS I CAN KEEP EVERYONE HEALED AND KNOW MY LIMITS!!"
---
I’m super pumped seeing posts like this on here. I wonder how many people out there are like you who are looking to play WoW for the first time and starting with Classic. I’m so excited for any new players. 
---
I’m also slightly worried. I hope the playerbase is welcoming and patient with any new players and willing to help them learn and not criticize anything that isn’t min/max perfect spec, etc...
---
Welcome to WoW! I hope you love it.
---
&gt; on beta, atleast, people barely ever speak in dungeon 
---
Who is "people"? And how many are not talking? 
---
Also, are you aware that the entire beta will be wiped ? I mean, is there a reason to be social in a beta? Not so much.
---
EVEN SO, people in beta talk to each other like 100 times more often than BfA.
---
Came through the portal and tried to murder all of human civilization *
---
Do forget about all the warriors that need your gear too.
---
The coin is two sided though.  Warriors in pvp dont get rage hitting your bubble either.
---
Classic exists because private servers. If blizzard dont make tbc, there will eventually be tbc servers as popular as nostalrius was.
---
TBC blizzard servers are inevitable imo.
---
It hasn’t really been that long though
---
if cannot beat them, join them... right? but if you skip the zone, who will collect them pages!?
---
Yeah it is pretty bad, not getting anything for a level is terrible. Some classes go 15 levels without getting anything new (spells/passives/talents) for their class. And your class stops growing/changing at 100 but the level cap is 120.

Yea if you don't have Mod it's really easy to get knocked out
---
Good rules to live by! Especially the DPS waiting and... Well frankly EVERYONE watching the healers Mana.
---
That is so wrong and I am back to being massively depressed and bitter.
---
Skipping STV entirely so I don't waste 10 hours of leveling killing Gnomes myself.
---
Almost did this to kill the hole in me until the 27th of Aug... happy I didnt, I know it would be lame AF
---
Prot Warrior: Fairly useless as damage even if I put on a 2her and dps gear. It's like all my weapons are made of wet noodles meant only to piss off my foes but not actually hurt them.
---
I have no doubt in my mind that the "LF2M 95+ parse only DPS no noobs"-crowd from Retail will attempt the same thing in Classic "LF3M full consumes/pre-BIS DPS warr/rog only!".
---
They're in for a rude awakening.
---
High elves to the alliance and goblins to the horde maybe?
---
*Scheduled* gaming time is actually considered hardcore by most people I know. It's a very small percentage of all gamers who are on board with something like scheduled raiding time. Once you go outside gamers it's borderline insanity. If you are not aware of this, you're in a bubble.
---
In other words, for most gamers, that reduces modern WoW to 0 community, which is exactly what happened.
---
I'm also skeptical that you can just login, show up and do Mythics, and then logout, without any kind of prior preparation or prior knowledge, whether that's inside the game or outside the game. That sounds like more of a case of you spending time on things and not tracking it inside your head, or getting lucky with some drops (very possible in Legion it was random AF). At the very least maintaining ilvl, AP, learning your class, running sims, etc., all of these things take time and more importantly, mental energy.
---
Maybe there was some much more efficient way to do everything but I haven't found it nor did most people around me, so what of it?
---
This sounds a bit like the kind of people who say leetcode interviews are fine because they happen to really like algorithms so the whole thing is effectively free and easy for them. Have some self-awareness, there's more to the world than just you and people like yourself. If you don't understand why something is difficult, problematic, or unwelcoming for another person, it means just that - that you don't understand. If your immediate response is just to assume that they are bad, well, that's a very narrow outlook on life.
---
That's amazing, reminds me of old arcade games (Metal Slug X etc).
---
I'm making a lore-focused addon atm. It was surprizing to realize that Darkspear Trolls and especially Tauren are just as sketchy lore-wise. 
---
The only thing that ever happened to Tauren is them nomading for centuries, fighting centaurs, then joining Horde.
---
But I agree that Gnomes are quite a placeholder race that was probably meant to be the one with Dwarves. These two words are basically synonyms in English, and I know that in Russian translation of Warcraft 3 Muradin was called a "gnome".
---
Yeah, that's what they are gonna do... punish exist players for being loyal consumers while rewarding people who have been gone since TBC or Wrath along with people who have been play illegal versions of the game on private servers.  Yeah, makes total sense.
---
Who wants to join my Rogue only guild?
---
I would wish very hard they’d reconsider putting blood elves in the Horde. They are a huge reason I committed to the switch to alliance since the addition of a”pretty” race plus crossing Paladin and Shaman are what killed Horde identity.
---
I did and will be pvping on mage so yeah, you need to respec every time for pvp. Usually people clear in a day if they are good, maybe two. So you will respec, clear that day or the day after, then respec back.
---
Idk if other classes you can get away with running the same spec, but for mage definitely not.
---
TFW when you are alone at the instance entrance and the other 9 group members are still in Orgrimmar expecting to be summoned for the UBRS run.
---
[Try this] (https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker).
---
Has anyone from the Beta confirmed cloth droprates in the areas near the starting zones? I know a lot of people who want to turn 3 stacks of linen into a lesser magic wand.
---
Post would normally be removed, but one of our moderators approved it (u/soupasoka) and now we are in too deep.
---
That's more a problem with stat scaling than world scaling, though.
---
When you class is reliant on crit and you lose crit with every level that's what makes you weaker.
---
World Scaling in itself was not a terrible idea I feel. It has some downsides but also solved some of the problems retail WoW had created, like outleveling a zone before being able to finish it's main story, let alone bonus quests. Or friends not being able to quest together because they're 5 levels apart.
---
A much bigger problem is that basically only the health of the mobs scales, making it nothing more but tedious to fight them. They cannot really hurt you, but you still need 20 seconds to kill one (or AoE 10 down). I don't know who at Blizzard thinks that long ass fights that pose no threat are fun. What's the point in that shit if there is no danger of me dying at all?
---
If it's red, it's dead.  
---
However, I never make a point to go to a low level zone just to kill lowbies.  If I'm passing through, I might ask /1 if anybody is being ganked or needs somebody dealt with, but I enjoy making people very *nervous* instead of just pressing 1 button and getting no satisfaction from their death.
---
IIRC shards disappear after being logged off for 15 minutes. So you have to grind them out before raid, and you can't just afk your character to keep them because the game will log you out after \~20 minutes afk. So it's quite an annoyance if, for instance, you get home from work and only have an hour before raid, you have to rush and grind mobs to get shards then head over to the raid instance to use them to summon lazy people (Some people have excuses, but in a 40 man raid group unless you're in a HC raid guild, there will always be lazy people).
---
I'm one of those unsubbed that is coming back 100% because of classic. 
---
Stopped playing after a few months of Wrath. I thought TBC was awesome and honestly wouldn't mind if they eventually made servers that allowed to progress your classic character onto that expansion if you wanted to. 
---
But I am *super* excited to play classic WoW again.
---
Its okey! You did great
---
  /script PlayerFrameTexture:SetTexture("Interface\\\\TargetingFrame\\\\UI-TargetingFrame-Rare-Elite");
---
Well yeah with that attitude
---
If you don't want to heal then definitely don't roll shaman 😂 if they do in fact have TBC servers afterwards locks are very desirable in both pvp and PVE. At least on the TBC pserver I'm playing on they seem to be.
---
Not true.  We also ask for summons.
---
Yea, no
---
Some people do hate the big changes like the item squishes. My mom complains about it actually, she hates it when she logs in and has like no health or damage suddenly. It is all relative, but it does matter to some. I like seeing the smaller numbers, i'll always miss critting a 6.5M damage Starsurge on Imonar but overall the smaller numbers are way better.
---
The level squish is gonna be jarring, REALLY jarring. But it is not gonna kill the game. Do we need it? I don't know, i'm iffy about it myself. On one hand, I hate leveling on Retail because it FEELS like a slog, i've been playing and leveling for so long there's nothing new to experience and it just feels bad to do it over again. It FEELS like it takes ages, even though it only takes a few weeks for me to get a new toon to 120. Having 60 levels but with the exact same leveling time would mean there wouldn't be massive 20+ level gaps between new abilities.
---
Do we need it? Fudge, I don't know. But i'll continue debating that until I find out what I even want. I'll be okay with them doing it or not doing it
---
My goal is to take a bad guild and make them mediocre.
---
&gt;  I like the idea that pulling too many kobolds wil kill me 
---
For people that never played Vanilla and will play Classic, "too many kobolds" means 3. Not 10. Not 8. Not 5.
---
But 3.
---
I think its more that people want a certain class to be something that it just isn't.
---
Druid is a great pvp class and it can do its raid duty very well while specced for pvp. The catch is that its a support in raids and I think the people who want boomkin to be buffed refuse to acknowledge that the class is designed (intentional or not) to support, not main DD. Resto druid is legit GOOD in both wpvp, flag carrying, and raiding...
---
Thats my biggest issue with these 'buff offspec' positions; the classes theyre talking about are already good in a lot of ways and don't need to change to function or be wanted in the game. Not to mention the players that go bad specs for the under-dog aspect and still can perform at a passable level.
---
I'm sorry, at what point did I become responsible for *your* inability to generate soul shards during trash? Every other warlock makes do.
---
That'll change I'm sure when it goes live and the population is huge. Playing on Nost when pop. was 10-12k there was plenty of talking. While waiting to find your tank/healer people tend to chat a little more. High level dungeons that were pugs tend to be slower runs and allowed for idle chitchat. early on people may not be talkative but the community, although toxic at times, has always been a mostly positive experience and I think the old school players behavior will trickle down to the newbies that never got to experience vanilla. The ones that are mostly toxic will get sick of not being handed gear and go back to retail (BfA).
---
They won't cos it costs money.
---
I mean I'll sometimes kill them but unless they camped a friend or did something shitty I wouldn't sit there and actively camp them.
---
I stoped watching the beta so the hype won’t die out
---
Never understood the forum changes.
---
It depends on their attitudes tbh. The non-dps only classes like warriors and druids who refuse to tank or heal and act entitled can go fuck themselves and get geared after the tanks and heals.
---
Boi you ain't hitting level cap after playing about 40 hours total assuming you work a 9-5 job and go to bed around 10 or 11.  You'll be about 45 hours in after Sunday night..probably level 30-40ish. 
---
120 hours minimum to hit 60 if you're a relatively good speed leveler.
---
Same here. It's so well done
---
Poopish. The trinket and the chest are both so appealing too (I used to be a warrior but I'm gonna be playing paladin in classic), but I figure around the time I start this quest is when I'm going to stop being able to tank and soloing is going to be less important so the ring is probably a no brainier
---
I'm looking forward to getting all the race-specific special attack animations back. A male orc warrior swinging a massive axe over his head is way better (imo) than the generic upwards swing they gave all races in retail
---
Interesting, I love anything bound to CTRL+number just because between that, shift, and alt, CTRL is the only one I didn't have to move my hand for. I just press it with the side of my palm and it works so naturally for me.
---
So it seems a lot of people are giving you more jokey answers than anything.
---
Let me try to shed some light on some of the major differences.
---
PvE vs PvP: If your goal is to PvE, without a doubt you should go Alliance. They benefit more from Paladin blessings than Tauren druids benefit from Shaman totems.
---
But PvP I would have to give the edge to Tauren. Not having to fight shaman OR orcs is huge. Shaman hard counter druid so bad it isn't even funny. Also, as an NE druid having to fight orcs sucks. Getting one of your stuns resisted can mean to difference between life and death for you as a druid. While both Tauren and NE have decent racials for pvp, I have to give the edge to Tauren for the 5% hp buff and warstomp.
---
Leveling: Both NE and Tauren starting zones are some of my favourite in the game. Plus Druids get the awesome Teleport: Moonglade spell. This spell is especially great for Night Elves because it is like a 2 minute  flight from Moonglade to Darn. While leveling this is really good. Say you are questing in Eastern Kingdoms but need to head to Kalimdor for some reason, well, you can just teleport and be where you need pretty fast (unless you are going really far, like Un'Goro or Tanaris). For Tauren its like an 8-12 minute flight to Thunder Bluff (I forget the exact length of time because whenever I make the flight I just leave the computer and do something else for a while). I have to give the edge to Night Elf here just because I slightly prefer Teldrassil and Darkshore to Mulgore and Barrens, and because setting your hearth at Wetlands and having a free teleport to moonglade is great for getting around the world.
---
Lore: In my eyes Night Elf are THE druid race. In a perfect world there would be two faction specific classes. Paladin/Shaman and Druid/Warlock. Sadly this is not the case because it would be absolutely insane to balance. Tauren as Druids makes sense I guess, but I feel a disconnect there because there was no mention of druidism in tauren culture in WC3 and it wasn't until WoW that taurens became druids. With that said, Tauren still have some pretty cool druid lore all things considered. 
---
Forms: Cat/Bear/Moonkin forms are different for both, and generally I think it's pretty unanimous that everyone thinks the NE models for their forms are much better. Taurens cat form is alright. Or at least it would be alright if it didn't have the face of a wyvern, because I do like it's mane. Also, Tauren bear for isn't my favourite either with it's horns. I like NE's bear more because it's more subtle in that the bear has night elf ears. Moonkin, although it's unlikely you will ever really roll one, definitely looks better for NE as well as it has these cool antlers.
---
It really is a tough call to be honest. But I think at the end of the day you have to think about what you want to do. Do you want to enjoy the leveling experience and focus more on PvE/Raids? Night Elf is probably the better choice. Do you want to focus more on PvP and have better flight paths throughout the world? Tauren is probably the better choice. I know with everything I said it sounds like I have a bias for Night Elf druids, which I probably do, but I'm still more than likely going to be rolling Tauren.
---
Yeah part of rolling a lock is having that unique ability. Playing a lock and being annoyed about summoning is like playing a mage and being annoyed at making food, or a paladin and having to buff people. It's what makes your class special.
---
Just curious, do you have sources on these numbers? From what I understand I thought they stopped releasing sub numbers, but I'd enjoy looking at the data if you have a source for it.
---
Yes, but using a never accurate 15 mil sub count to dwarf current retail isn’t really equitable. Peak Vanilla had about the same sub count as WoD, an expansion many people hated. It’s been declining for a long time, due to both cultural disinterest in the genre as well as some not great design methods used by Blizzard. The pile of people waiting for Vanilla is a vocal group and one that Blizzard wants to tap, but the legion of exponential customer growth Vanilla saw will not be the same.

Classic *is* slow, but it also isn't a mad dash for levelcap like modern WoW is. Part of your adventure is the leveling process. In modern WoW, you adventure *starts* at levelcap - the leveling process feels like a chore with very poor progression (seriously, your playstyle/"rotation" may slightly change, if at all, every 15-30 levels.)
---
yes... im ok with this
---
The problem is that all the best routes are posted in guides, so most people will be on the same path camping same areas.
---
So people will divert and just grind something near, which means those are camped also.
---
When I was in the stress test, the entire zone had every mob dead and people just running randomly hoping to tag anything for xp.  Basically the only time we could get kills was when the server crashed, and we logged back in faster than most and was able to get off some kills before the zerg logged back in.
---
Hunters are the fastest levelers, followed by druids,  Mages and warlocks are next. Mages can be Tier 1, if they have solo access to AW grinding spots, otherwise Warlocks beat them easily.
---
For early starting zones leveling, you want to group with as many people possible for Kill quests, and consider skipping/abandoning collection quests.   Classes with early instant tag abilities (e.g. hunter, druid should be your priority party members to add in the starting zones kill quests)
---
You may also want to consider, playing a lesser played races for less competition. That would be Tauren on the horde side. Although personally, I'd rather play what I want to play, and just plan to travel to less popular racial areas. I'll pick up discovery and and flight paths along they way. (which saves time later)  Graveyard hoping makes it pretty quick, and no real drawbacks.
---
At what point did the lock become responsible for your inability to not click a button during an hour. Every other player makes do, and other lock do not like I explained, unless you just want to continue ignoring points because you can’t refute them?
---
Plains track.
---
I'm the kind of person that only listens to in game music, and honestly Classic is a bit annoying with that. It has AWESOME peaceful calming music, but too little. You kinda get tired of the Plains track after enough hours...
---
I wanna make an addon that puts all the Retail tracks (the ones that actually fit with Classic, like Mulgore, NOT things like Xaxas or Twilight's Hammer) into Classic. I've slowly been working on it, but I have no LUA experience haha
---
You don't have to go fully into a tree to utilize what it has available. There are numerous builds that dip into several trees to get certain bonuses - the 'game' of building your talents is the talent investment and payoff of how you distribute your points
---
that's some obscure logic you have there :S
---
Could you make a Stratholme one that doesnt specify living or undead? Loving these in any case. :)
---
To be honest I'm not sure it was the wrong decision financially. WoW isn't really failing so far (although I hear a lot of bad stuff about BfA, but that is may just be the vocal classic server crowd). And who knows if the old school wow is sustainable long term from the business point of view.
---
Shards do not disappear. You're thinking about conjured items, like mage food.
---
Haha, the urge is strong isn't it.
---
Same.
---
I'm still incredibly hyped, but there's really no point in watching videos anymore. The only videos I'm still checking out are those on how to most optimally skill up certain professions and where to farm for them. Because that is something that I *definitely* messed up on my original play through of vanilla. Pretty much had to start all of them after 60 because I just thought they were pointless and got in the way of my leveling speed.
---
&gt; It seems to me that the main reason people are against layering is the fact that early lvl60s will be able to layer hop to farm multiple servers worth of resources.
---
No no no no that's not the main issue. Its a big issue but not that main one.
---
To be frank, secondary stat downscaling is much more of a problem in terms of feeling like you get weaker than scaling mobs are.
---
As a Fire Mage, losing crit with every level you gain just worsens your rotations to the point where you feel ineffective. I feel that's much worse than mobs scaling up with me so I cannot just oneshot everything eventually.
---
The real joke though is how Blizzard stresses that 100 ilvls per raid tier is important for players to feel like they're getting more powerful just to then go around and scale everything with your ilvl so you don't just rush through it. Like... at this point all your precious 100 ilvls do is show you much bigger numbers while only making you marginally more powerful. Why not just decrease ilvl inflation at this point?
---
is ok bb. We'll always have the Abyssal Maw.
---
OH WAIT
---
Exactly those turtles are worth it and they are yellow. So you won't pull more or they wont run away. So you are always in the clear for that shit. Never have to worry about dealing with that shit at all. i think it is a great spot to grind because you have an endless supply of cooking food so you never have to buy any if you carry flint and tinder on you. You can just cook it on the spot out here and just eat it for HP recovery.
---
I don't respec with my main all that much once I start raiding.   
---
I do respec a bunch with alts to experience new things.
---
I corrected the 15
---
So many times I had to yell at people that it takes more than me and the one guy to summon someone. They would still get all pissy on you for not summoning.  
---
I actually quit a few groups after 15 minutes of them ignoring me.
---
People did abuse (and Blizzard did try to prevent) OOC rez during vanilla. Patch 1.9 added this:
---
&gt;It should now be very difficult to remain out of combat while fighting the bosses in Molten Core.
---
But sure, it wasn't very well known. Neither was proper itemization. It was definitely there though.
---
You will enjoy it
---
Ah yes the infamous social classic community
---
&gt; Dont think most retail players will actually switch to classic for their main game.  
---
Remind me this in December.
---
I will try to post all the treads that now are on the line of : "Will Classic kill BfA?", and after August will be on the line of : "Fuck me...Classic actually DID killed BfA".
---
Don't get me wrong, BfA serves will still be on-line and running...but by the end of this year, more than half of the already very low population of BfA will play Classic as their MAIN GAME.
---
&gt; World PvP at your detriment, a 110 could easily take a 120 at launch.
---
Because of secondary stats and more importantly legendary effects that got disabled at 115
---
That might have been one of the best shaman guides on youtube. Thank you, Im surprised you havnt gotten more attention. GL!
---
Hey that’s a good question, I’m also curious about this. I’m pretty sure The Persuader and Sageblade recipes came with the world bosses. But I’d like to know when the recipes for Thorium Brotherhood faction are available.
---
The vanilla data is publically available because that was back when they still released the info, but the BFA subs were leaked I'll post the link in an edit in a second (on mobile)
---
Are you illiterate? **I** played a warlock. **I** was the one summoning people.
---
I was there! Also, fuck [Horrigan.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Horrigan)
---
Thx for response; Overall nice Site 👍🏼 some items like mirahs song showing wrong sources(it’s a quest in scholo, But there stands just kirtonos the herald as source) ... i think just a Bit polish at some points and this Site is Genius
---
I want an arms warrior, mace spec, with the hand of rag.
---
Then I want to bop people with it in battlegrounds
---
Consider that starting with Classic will not give you character progression in future and at some point you will have nothing to do, no new patches, no new expansion. Also be aware that at that point most Classic players will just have option to switch to their modern characters but you would have to start from zero in modern WoW. If that doesnt matter to you and you dont mind really slow / archaic gameplay, then Classic is viable option.
---
Lol what? I've joined a Guild since I resubbed a few weeks ago and play with people pretty regularly.
---
A trustworthy enchanter that has wares for my coin.
---
Generally red = dead. Personally I'll kill a lower level if I happen to run past him, but I wont actively seek out lower levels to kill. Usually I wont kill a player more than once unless he wants to fight more, or if we're competing for quest mobs. But that's just how I play, people should be able to do whatever they want, there should be no enforced ethic. If you're the kind of oddball who for some reason finds it enjoyable to continually oneshot lowbise in redridge for hours then go nuts.
---
I'm actually very interested in seeing how the DPS meta is going to be affected in classic. While expectations should be close to the reality of what transpired 15 years ago, people need to understand that almost every class had a major rework at some point between 1.1 to 1.12. We're going to be playing classes in classic Molten Core with 1.12 class buffs/nerfs.
---
That being said, I still think warriors and rogues are gonna dominate, but I think your enhancement shammies and ret pallies are not gonna be that pitiful
---
Fuck this meme is perfect hahahaha
---
Haha yeah going into that barrow as a druid or hunter is rough. I usually group up in there
---
Imo, I think Enhancement shamans are *way* more viable than ret paladins. At least if I had to choose between a raid slot for a ret or an enhancement, it'd be enhancement all day long.
---
I'd put the 3 points from improved roots into the talent that improves crit rate in forms by 6%
---
Looks okay for pvp, I would probably get 5 points in improved bash though.
---
"Someone as shitty as you"
---
Yeah fuck this guy for being efficient. What a total asshole.
---
You should never use sp gear while leveling. Spirit &gt; Int &gt; Stam. That is all.
---
If this level is know players will adapt around it unfortunately...
---
Everything that could give advantage which is not prevented by the game will obviously be abused...
---
“You spank it, you tank it.”
---
So you're telling me there's a chance.
---
&gt; For me? I just don't have the time to dedicate to vanilla, its 100 times more a grind than vanilla 
---
Actually, Vanilla is less (MUCH LESS) time consuming than Retail. Not knowing this shows how much you know about Vanilla.
---
You talk like it’s happening.  It won’t.  The “leak” was designed to stir shit up not as a warning it was coming.
---
I’m planning on going Balance so can’t use that.
---
 &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!  
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.   
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random. 
---
Raid Schedule: Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday 6 - 9 PST, 7 - 10 MST, 8 - 11 CST, 9 - 12 EST. 
---
Recruiting: 
---
Druid: Open (Healer) 
---
Hunter: Open 
---
Mage: Open 
---
Paladin: Open (Healer) 
---
Priest: Open (Healer) 
---
Rogue: Open 
---
Warlock: Open 
---
Warrior: Open  
---
[https://discord.gg/zjWafMJ](https://discord.gg/zjWafMJ)
---
I actual think I want to get a Druid to 60 first so everything here is good news to me 
---
Also, im not taking time off from work or changing my lifestyle for a game that I “beat” in high school so I expect to be very far behind the pack rushing to 60 after the first week or two
---
They're right, because the sp coefficients in air are dog shit.
---
Yeah, they're basically just smaller versions of Dwarves. It's true that the Darkspear Trolls and Taurens have very limited backstories as well, but at least they have their own culture and personality beyond "Hey look, I'm cute!".
---
We need one more of these with the addition: "When the hunter pet is on aggressive"
---
Some say yes and others say no. So I say hello.
---
Would love to have a model viewer, aesthetics play a huge roll in what pieces I use, which is why I use wowhead so much, very cool regardless.
---
Raid bosses are immune to Vindication.
---
&gt; I mean, retail only has 3 million subs at this point 
---
Highly optimistic. Try more like 2 million. With half of them playing Classic as their main game.
---
A true canadian
---
When you're seeing this meme format for the 4th today.
---
"Ah shit, here we go again."
---
Take my time and enjoy hitting 60 on my rogue. Gear up as much as possible without being able to do 40 mans. Be an annoyance in WPVP. That's really it.
---
Agree, the ingame music goes a long way. At some point, though, you've heard every piece enough to know.
---
I think forcing everyone over level 30 to one layer might work as well. 
---
The biggest challenge will be the huge influx of players early on. These will be casual players, online for an hour or two a day. It’ll take most of them one, two, or three weeks to get past level 30. There will be tons of them, and they will be crowding the lower level zones for a long time. 
---
Those serious players who treat the game like a full time job will be much fewer in number.
---
people cried and made them get rid of attunements. lol
---
Is DM gonna be the best farm area for every classes ?
---
Probably only because of his terrible pathing \^\^
---
Yeah if only loot councils could use some sort of point system, like a running tally converted into points that represents effort put into the guild, attendance, and previous loot acquisition history. Some sort of point system when you attend raids to kill dragons.
---
I dunno, I’m fishing, it’ll never work.
---
I don't play on a PvP server because I want to gank other players. I do it for the additional adrenaline and tension while playing.
---
I'll mostly just do self defense.
---
true ret paladins wont be competeing against anyone except other paladins for gear.
---
And me personally corrupted ashbringer.
---
I PVP so meh. Only raid content I care about is Hand of Rag
---
My guild solved this issue just by starting at raid time no matter the numbers. We were raiding the MC with 20-25 people from time to time.  People who showed up late got half the DPK.
---
To all the people who hate on ret/feral/balance/shadow/ele/etc ... you gotta realize how great it is having a second healer or second tank in the group for those times when someone ninja pulls an extra pack. Sure they don't scale into raids well but in 5/10 mans.... these "meme" specs are incredible.
---
Oh really?  I didnt think they were popular because they were so far from the rest of alliance.  I would have thought the same for all the UD zones early on.
---
Terrorizing Astranaar.
---
Well, not in classic anyway (and I know, that's the context :p )
---
In BC zipping back and forth was an amazing way of mass-pulling dungeons without taking damage, as a warrior that is.   
---
It was the golden age of AoE'ing everything to hell.
---
[itemization.info](https://itemization.info) will tell you each patch that an item was added or updated. So [Persuader](https://itemization.info) for example was added in patch 1.10.
---
There were a lot of itemization additions/changes in 1.10, and those are coming with Phase 5:
---
&gt;Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
Yeah, and Im going to maintain that pace until I hit 60, is that not clear? This isnt my plan for my first 2 weeks, this is my schedule for until I hit the specified milestones. It will take 3-5 weeks to hit level cap in my estimation.
---
Dragonforce
---
The most painful for me was in BC - shadow labs trash packs before Blackheart.  
---
I was the only CC for our run, so I would seduce, fear (v risky before the world of glyphs), banish and do some DPS in a single pull.
---
I quit in cata and came back at the end of legion. Don't think I've pulled my Succy out once since I came back, it has been either void or imp.
---
I wouldn't care. But i just hope they would use the proper blood elf skin and not the poor one from Vanilla... Seriously this alpha skin is scary...
---
For sure, rogue can either turn a team fight, or wander around in stealth waiting for an opportunity that won't end with the whole opposing team jumping on them the moment they pop like some mad-rush game of whack-a-mole. If you can lock down a healer, no matter how, you've definitely made a good "trade." I do maintain they can be useful in team fights, but they're more of an x-factor than most other classes because popping stealth at bad times is a complete waste.
---
I think I'll level alchemy and herb, then switch herb to engineering and gather the mats for engi on an alt. Especially with the delayed honor
---
Half the classes in the game could tank all the 5-mans if you really wanted. It just requires that the test of your group slightly use their brains. Paladins should have no problem tanking 5 mans if they have proper gear and spec.
---
Then don't advertise the level or better yet have it be dynamic. Early on it could be one span and later on when more people are high level it could be a different one
---
No you just haven’t argued a single point and just saying things that are not true, a literate person knows how to have a discussion, and how to argue points. You have failed to do that with any proficiency, I gave reason and support to my arguments while yours are to ignore points and say you played a lock. You missed huge parts of the equation when talking about soul shards, such a huge one I have trouble believing someone who ignores that SSs are needed in raid. How can one trust your literacy if you can’t think 1 step ahead when discussing things like these?
---
You got him there.
---
I'm fine with a timegate until the "flood" of players is over. Otherwise people &lt;56 could still take advantage of this and destroy the market for lower level materials. I can't recall if you can still reach 300 or not under level 60, but if you can... level 55 doesn't even matter.
---
That's fine. I don't HAVE to play with these people. I can make a blacklist of idiots and never have to group with them, because I build my own groups instead of having an algorythm find 4 strangers who I'll never meet again.
---
Your reputation in classic is important. If evereyone on the servers knows you're a tool that keeps pulling while the healer is oom, you're not getting any more group invites. It's glorious.
---
I levled one to 60 here recently and almost never wanded. I used drain life and life tap after dotting up a mob. Almost 0 down time all the way to 60.
---
Oh darkshore? It's kinda meh but Ashenvale is cool
---
It seems to me like player regen is way too high in that example video.  It lets them remain in melee combat where I feel like it should not be feasible.  Perhaps I'm not realizing the impact of the troll racial.
---
I remember. Still better than Dungeon Finder.
---
If you're a little bitch, you gank lowies.
---
I know, that's why I said it. It was popular, therefore it was 'fixed'.
---
They would have fixed buff stacking too if it was more popular.
---
&gt; Early Cata was among the best WoW has been in a long time in terms of difficulty.
---
Cata was released almost a decade ago... closer to the release of WoW itself than the present day.
---
Yet you still bought BFA and you still re-subbed for a slim chance at beta (speaking of casino cash grab). So Blizzard won, again. Next time don't be a sheeple and vote with your wallet if you're so desperate to see the WoW franchise change course.
---
Youre literally trading Defensive for Offense by saying that. Thats like the only real key difference betwern pally and sham
---
Imagine not getting him there.
---
With a casual guild it's also experience.  With so many people cycling in and out of raiding it takes a lot longer for the raid group to learn a fight.  My guild experienced an extremely long block at Razorgore for this reason.
---
Because destruction spec warlocks have the potential eat through them worse than candy (especially in pvp) and have to farm a fuck ton of them accordingly.
---
its not gonna be available on phase 1. i think only mage and hunter can solo farm it. u could do it as a duo too i guess; shaman druid, shaman warlock
---
It's not just level 60s.
---
It's pretty much anyone above level 25.
---
There are people in Beta Level 30 with enough Arena chests to have Grand Master Arena in a few hours of layer hopping.
---
I wouldn't focus on the lvl55 part. Focus on the solution. The level span could be 30-60 for all we know.
---
The healer's mana is your mana if you're a tank.
---
Oh okay, that makes it a bit easier then. Thanks for clarifying that
---
marketing: if you can polish a turd well enough you can sell people dogshit
---
You are doing all that noise for 5 min? Like what the hell is going on in this sub.
---
Dungeon finder locked to just your server would be the ideal.
---
That's a lot of text for something people probably don't want.
---
funny enough 5 fps was "good enough" for me. :D
---
It wasnt that difficult mechanic wise to begin with... if you had 5 fps on retail raids then youd probably be dead every pull.
---
Sad story in the life of young me: i got my first desktop during tbc to replace the laptop i had been using... but the desktop must have been just as shitty because i didnt notice any immediate difference in performance = maximum disappointment.
---
The shield option from that quest is really good too, but the wand is really a can't-miss for casters.
---
You are exactly right.
---
You posted that after I edited it, it was 3.2 mil at it's peak, last we "know" it was around 1.7
---
There was a leak a while ago and that's the info I'm referring to. It's the only data we have on subs so I'm operating on it being true, but keep in mind it may not be correct.
---
Level 30 is a good number because you start really seeing a lot of crafting resources used for end game dropping around 30+.
---
There will be people who layer hope all through 30-60 farming resources with ease for 60 endgame stuff.
---
I've always mained rogue and think I will again, but I also  want to try something new so I think I might also roll a shaman and go resto for grouping and enh for solo. I've actually never played shaman before and I don't remember much about them from vanilla so not sure what to expect (btw anyone have any insights there?)
---
Rogue will probably be the character I play by myself and  the shaman I'll just play with some rl friends who are also picking up classic.
---
What's the worst of the three:
---
\- Clickers
---
\- Backpedalers
---
\- Keyboard turners
---
Almost no horde players wanted blood elves. It was forced onto them because Blizzard wanted a cute race for the horde. For the current horde, the manly horde, it was forced feminisation, and many of us absolutely hated it. So no they definitely should not have blood elves on horde! I think Classic+ should have original BROKEN Draenie + Blood elves + Naga in a separate Outland faction, or something
---
&gt; I think forcing everyone over level 30 to one layer might work as well.
---
I agree. Or whatever level is the level where abusing layers is possible.
---
certain ranks are just plain honour gained right? while some are as you say, scaling
---
Call that the "pace Car".
---
Don't care what anyone says, Ret Paladin is fun.  Certainly not the best but as long as you don't tunnel vision on DPS while fighting/gearing up its a fun way to play imo.
---
SF spec is fine and I don't think anyone can really give it any negative feedback - if they are, they don't know what they are talking about.
---
I played SF for quite a while, then switched over to a hemo build. Hemo was a completely different way of playing and really made you feel powerful in a very different way. I liked it a lot and was a big fan of the stunlock playstyle.
---
Or even Shift+T by default
---
That is super lame
---
Other than logging my IP and email, this would be nice.
---
Get thee off of this subreddit, for it shall taint your pure heart.
---
Seriously, stop reading up on this game, go in blind, be the biggest neeb you can possibly be. And your experiance will be so much better for it.
---
If they could, half the people on this sub would wish that they could erase all the experiance they have of classic and play it fresh.
---
I have not watched those videos but I will check them out. He should have time to gear up so I think it will be okay. Thanks for the advice.
---
I agree 100% and it's the next major feature on my list. It just didn't impact functionality as much as most other things so I decided to leave it from the initial implementation. Thanks for the feedback.
---
IT LOOKS SO GOOD THOUGH.
---
They're in a rough spot in terms of debuffs. Last I remembered, Vindication does not work on bosses so it's a waste of points in terms of raiding. Furthermore, I don't think a raid leader would be happy if you're occupying a debuff slot with judgement of the crusader since almost nobody needs an increase in holy dmg, so your DPS is even worse
---
Frost mages were probably at their strongest point ever in TBC pvp. Just the straight insanity of permanently rooting and slowing people.
---
I would gladly take a ret paladin to a 5man over a second rogue/mage/etc.
---
They have no idea what a spelladin is
---
And how useful they are for gearing out your warriors.
---
It does not really matter your main job is to be a tranq bot if you can press tranq at the right time. Youre fine
---
&gt; expect griefing and gatekeeping the likes of which you've never seen
---
wow allows for these in extreme amounts without reprocussion haha
---
I find it amusing that the poster above you thinks it's in any way difficult to find a dps DPS for any dungeon.
---
Not sure about retail, but in classic the bottleneck was always Tank or Healer. DPS players populate dungeon runs as fast as the slots are available.
---
Everybody who chooses to play a gnome is a sexual deviant. That's just scientific fact.
---
If you believe them, and don’t think this is all some sort of anti consumer conspiracy, the format they had the back up of a backup on was exactly what you’d call “extremely unprofessional in tech in general”. 
---
If that’s the case, we have to find some other archaic backup hidden back up to find an even older av.
---
Blizzard prior to wow launching wasn’t some crazy monolith in pc gaming, they had 300 employees. And they accidentally made one of the most popular pieces of software to date. While I think not have no backups of this shit is wild, I don’t not believe them
---
Just looking back and remembering how different blizzard was back then before tbc, I totally see it as possible. Bunch of 20 somethings who had never made a product like this just blowin and goin trying to get content into the game and keep servers up.
---
Blizzard wanted "support" to be a role but it didn't really work out in practice, and Blizzard eventually abandoned the concept.
---
That still doesn't change people exploiting lower levels or having lower level characters take advantage of higher level and lower level materials. The problem still persists. I'd love to focus on a the solution, but it's pretty damn ignorant to ignore the problem too. So, yeah.
---
They did reuse WoD content for the BFA warfronts and it was alright, i mean warfronts have a lot of issues but the art is fine.
---
That said they used one huge night elf building from legion (well a few buildings  for Nazjatar 8.2 content (same era of the lore, Nelf buildings before the sundering) and added a few deep sea decorations and they got trashed for "low effort reused content"
---
I guess it stands to reason to expect new art from a 45€ expansion but it seems WoW players aren't really open to the idea of reused content, or at least low effort ones.
---
Yes but would people stop leveling just to do that? I'm sure there's a magic level where using a single layer is optimal where people will sacrifice leveling for greed, what that number is I don't know but I don't think it's as early as lvl30.
---
I kinda want to make a guild exclusively of unpopular builds and see how far we get.
---
Ret paladins with Improved Sanctity Aura to pair with Smite Priests. Druid main tank. Disc Priest healers, arcane mages, melee hunters, HotW druid healers.
---
You need, at bare minimum, 2 hunters for tranq shot. If you are in a casual guild you probably need 4 for when your hunters fuck up/miss on magdamar and 6 for Chrommaggus.
---
Pff, Stitches' got nothing on the Eastvale Logging Camp Murlocs.
---
I'm not an experienced player. Legion was my first time doing any kind of serious raiding. I got very little help or instruction from my guild. I got to 7/7 Heroic EN with a lot of stress and you told me that's garbage. So that's nice and really encourages me to try Mythic raiding.
---
I have and always had a full time job so I'm not sure what your point about university and such is. Hardcore gaming doesn't preclude having a job, there are medical students who can do world first raiding, it just eats into the overall time and that has consequences. While it could all be done if you're an A-type personality who does everything with maximum efficiency at all times, I was never that person and if my time gets too structured I start feeling stressed and like I have no time of my own left. I need my fuck around time, both in life and in the game. I am not alone and I'd wager most people are more similar to me than to you.
---
Mythic+ does not attract me in the slightest. I abhorre being timed. Modern has no content for me. At the very least before I get to any of this I'd still need to do horrid braindead gear grinds or resource grinds, I just know it.
---
Vanilla is considerably more MMO than Mythic raiding, so your statement makes no sense. MMO is about interacting with large amounts of people, meeting new friends while playing, and inviting your current friends to play with you. Mythic raiding is limited to 20 people. That's not massive. Most of those are going to be people you already know. Often you need not really interact with anyone else outside that group. Inviting your friends to play won't work because the limiting factor is skill, and what if your friend is just not skilled? Do you tell them to fuck off? lol There is no world with that raiding. You're sitting in an instance with a small, curated group of people, often found outside the game. None of this is massive, it's just multiplayer.
---
I think you are the one who likes the multiplayer arena that modern WoW has become, and we are the ones who want an MMORPG. Modern raiding is more PvE Dota than it is MMO.
---
I will be sure to reserve the name Bacon
---
Honestly. If a tank doesn't want the stress of having to pull the aggro off overeager DPS that is perfectly understandable.   
---
As for handling it like an adult, well of course, but if you ask me this is the one inalienable right the tank has. Choosing how and when pulls are done.
---
I don't think 40-man raiders want epic PvP gear to be more accessible. I don't think most people who are competitive PvPers like the idea of someone getting as much rewards as they do via 1v1. It's just a whole big ol' bag of mess. I can't see anyone liking the specifics of this idea.
---
Good, healthy plan!  I'll be out there with ya going the slow and steady route.
---
Paladins are incredible in Vanilla for both pve and pvp

Yeah, I feel a similar way about the leak. While we can't know if it's true (blizz denied it, but they would HAVE to otherwise their stock would drop), I'm still going to treat it as true because it's the only info we have and it's good to have a starting point. I'm still taking it with a grain of salt, but it's more useful to treat it as correct and discuss from there than to reject it and have no starting point.
---
I assume u want to play dps?
---
Askin those kind of questions youll want to play a hunter or a warlock
---
Paladin isnt for u.
---
&gt; This same person is going to hit 60 after 3 months and cry that they cant get into a group in full greens as a elemental shaman.
---
If he plays well and socializes as he should he should easily find a group. Gear scaling was not as terrible then as it is now, a green leveling shaman is not THAT much worse than a dungeon equipped shaman. There's like 5 ilvls in between them. Playing properly and not being a nuisance will net you plenty of parties, whereas purples won't help you at all if you're known to be a sucker and jerk (in which case you wouldn't even have purples. Just for the sake of the argument)
---
Private servers are unofficial, were full of alterations to stats/mobs/ect, and could be shut down without a moments notice. Different feeling to them
---
I mean I did raid a lot. I just sort of enjoyed Naxx as a raid because of its atmosphere. I was always a fan of the bosses, the gear, etc. so I was generally pretty stoked about it even with the low difficulty. I felt similarly about Karazhan. Kara and Naxx were my two favorite raids. Ulduar is probably next favorite because that raid was just simply beautiful.
---
For sure, I re subbed again in preparation and my Gf has been watching me play asking if she should  create the trial account. I'm trying to keep her away so classic is the first wow experience she has.
---
Been playing pservers last 4 years.
---
I'm just hyped for a better and more official version of the game i'm already playing. Pservers aren't exactly flawless.. Though I will miss the tighter community.
---
&gt; community  
---
They put the WORLD into Warcraft.
---
They are fantastic support/healers. A few points as a lolret allows for smoother leveling. But your main role in raids/groups is that of a healer. A few of the typical morons will try to tell you that they make very good tanks, but those are usually the typical geniuses you see when a game releases who suggest bad builds/combos to try and feel special.
---
"Boring" is subjective really. I enjoyed playing paladin but you're mostly autoattacking while levelling. Their dmg isn't great in PvE but they're fine in PvP and as Holy they're very good healers.
---
It depends. I play retail on every expack launch for a few weeks becsuse new content and fresh story arcs, etc. But I won't ever be subbed to retail for more than a month.
---
 USA - East Coast Horde PVP
---
Seeking casual group of adults with responsibilities outside of WoW. Helpful and friendly folks that just want to enjoy the game. Mainly playing during the evenings after work (approximately 7pm - 10pm EST). 
---
Specifically, I would like to find a group of people that do not prioritize the "min-max" culture and want to enjoy the journey to level 60 at a stately pace. I have played on some private servers but haven't gotten to any end-game content yet and want to be able to experience it for the first time cold - without any guides or prior knowledge of what to expect. I'm going to main a Troll Priest with tailoring and enchanting professions. I'll probably have a mage and/or warlock alts. 
---
Let me know if you or someone you know is also interested in experiencing WoW for the first time with me.
---
forced account creation sucks orc balls
---
People wouldn't need to stop leveling. They would just do it as they level/grind.
---
Some people literally grind out 30-40 through select mobs that have good drops for crafts required at 60.
---
I really wonder who these players are that enjoy this crap. Like legitimately play a game that you absolutely cannot fail and then feel good about yourself and the rewards you got for being fucking terrible.
---
How can ANYONE enjoy questing in current wow?
---
Are you finished patting yourself on the back? I can wait if you're not.
---
When did I say that soulstones were not needed during raids?
---
You came into this discussion with a chip on your shoulder, your inability to manage your soul shards is not my problem. I managed. Every other warlock I've played with managed. Maybe when classic is released you'll be better this time around.
---
Well the option is to do nothing and have layering work exactly like it does now. That's worse.
---
I don't think players will sacrifice their leveling in order to abuse the system, some will but it won't be wide spread. Especially if the break point isn't known or even changing as time goes on.
---
I currently have a 40 warlock on the Beta and plan to be leveling one up on live. Usually people all run straight to the instance one we have a full group. People will usually ask for a summon if they need to finish up a quest chain for the instance or are super far away. I don't have a problem with this especially if they ask. I just check the map and if I see atleast two other people are close and look like they are heading to the instance all good. If not I say in /p "Hey I need two other people at the instance to be able to summon please start heading there." Never had an issue.
---
Honestly Depending on the dungeons your doing and what time your doing it you rarely need to go farther than zoning out and spamming the zone once before you can fill up a DPS spot.
---
Hell I have had instances where I would leave a cancerous run, hearth back to Org create a new group fly back to the zone, run to the dungeon entrance and wave mockingly to the group I left as they stand around the entrance of the same dungeon looking for another tank in zone chat.
---
i've had night-long discussion with my M+ group on how to time 19s and 20s.
---
on beta every dungeon I've done so far barely have anyone talking... heck, if you remove the '' I still need 3 more XYZ '' or '' where's the XYZ item I haven't looted it'' from people paranoid about not finishing their quest mid-way through the instance... it would be radio silence.
---
Pretty much any solo content.
---
PvE sucks even at 60 until you get geared.
---
PvP is perma slow world against a lot of classes and you do no damage without gear. In a pre-bis fight against a shadow priest you'd be lucky to get through his shield before dying.
---
&gt; Some people literally grind out 30-40 through select mobs that have good drops for crafts required at 60.
---
Wouldn't the value of those drops go down by a huge margin due to the market being saturated?
---
&gt; Algalon hit like two Brutallus' and it was possible to have a tank get globalled with cooldowns active.
---
And bear in mind algalon ALREADY hit far more frequently than many other bosses to help make the stream of damage more regular.
---
Gear check much? lol
---
They are fantastic healers and definitely will have multiple spots in raids. Many people complain about the slow/boring leveling process, but I actually enjoy not having to really worry about a big spell rotation, just relax and auto attack. Super versatile for doing dungeons because you are a viable tank, healer, and dps until you near 60 (which you can still do at lvl 60 dungeons if you have some gear). I'm also a sucker for their class quests (the hammer one is really fun) and the mounts.
---
I could understand why people would be more hyped to have actual legitimate classic characters on Blizzard servers again, versus Pserver characters which could be gone at any time if a given server folded.  I would think the sense of attachment would be much greater.
---
If shaman is any indication then yes.

IRONFIST is an adult community, this means we have no patience for a bunch of toxic, trolling, hard-core-wannabe people who would rather spend their days ripping on fellow guild/faction members than actually having fun. Most of us have families, and jobs that keep us busy, and we just want to sit down and play video games with a good group of people to decompress from the day.
---
**We are set to raid on Tuesday and Thursdays** from 7:30pm CST to 10:30pm CST, we will have a clean up raid on Sundays that the times are TBD. We have a lot of players who are also looking to get into PvP and work on the WL grind etc.

Funny enough we have all pretty much stuck to it since we graduated, of course we take time off here and there but always come back every expansion. There were 7 of us originally and so far we have lost one to a heart attack in 2012 and one to a 70+ hour a week job. But the 5 of remaing are still going strong. Well sorta. Waiting for 8.2 currently before we start playing again. Been about a month off so far.
---
DPS and tanking they're not very good.  Healing and especially PvP healing they're awesome.
---
Yeah the new FFXIV expansion is coming out for me, so while I'm not really hyped for that so much and Classic has completely overshadowed it, it will still at least be something to do for a while.
---
There's always the one mfer who's like, "You need to stay behind and defend. Call incs." Then goes running circles around AB and contributing nothing.
---
Leaving a comment so I can check back later.  If a SQL DB like this exists, i want it lol.
---
Difference is that in classic you can actually die if you do something wrong (pull too many mobs, run oom, pull when you're too low) and dying is punished with a 10 minute corpserun across the entire fucking map, whereas in retail you'll literally be always at full HP and mana while spamming smite and if you somehow die from falling off a cliff or something there'll be a graveyard in arms reach and you're back in the action in less than a minute.
---
This isn't about how challenging the rotation is, it's about what's at stake and how likely it is for that to happen.
---
Just curious, what stack did you use to create this?
---
Yeah sure, halve your damage in PvP and I'll take that trade.
---
or buttplug man
---
Exactly what I was thinking, man I miss that trio
---
I act thankful when I'm given a health stone and then forget about it.  If I'm popping one as a hunter it's game over any way.
---
Just because so many people get so damn serious you earned this upvote! You deserve it well.
---
It's not that bad. You spend a small bit of time grinding mobs before raid time. Some people farm mobs that have valuable crafting mats, like silithus elementals for essence of air for example. It makes for a slower grind but there is a bit of cash in it if you get lucky. You'll give as many cookies as you can in the raid and then farm shards off each trash pull in hopes to still have some shards for later.
---
I good way to tell if the group is a winner is if you don't have to summon anyone or if everyone starts the trek themselves then the first people there summon the people further away.
---
Early Cata was among was one of the best eras of WoW, imo. The very idea of Cata is that it's Vanilla, but a few years later. 
---
Logical continuation of the quest stories we did in Vanilla era? Check.
---
Old Villains (Rag, Nef, Ony) returns even more powerful than before? Check. Amazing fucking ambience in the raids itself as a cherry on the top.
---
Difficulty? CHECK. It was a fucking pleasure for the first days to get into the voice comms to do a simple heroic dungeon, because all of a sudden you couldn't just AoE pug it. 
---
And then you go into the forums and see literally HUNDREDS of new topics EVERY SINGLE DAY with kids demanding to "nerf it pl0x!!!1".
---
World Bosses were introduced once again, and they used to drop a good BLUE gear. I've got one the first day in the expac, that's probably one of the luckiest moments I've had in WoW :D
---
You also couldn't PUG a Normal Blackwing Descent with a raids you've did 11/12 HEROIC ICC. Glorious.
---
Gear mattered, professions mattered, they've kinda cut the talent tree, but it existed nevertheless, 5-man dungeons had no epics at all, you had to CC mobs in there, and so on. 
---
On top of that, there was beginning of a trial-twinks era, and the REAL twinks were alive thanks to the exploit that would let you get into "normal" BGs with stopped exp (fixed now). PWNing noobs with a full-gemmed DK or wiping a full raid single-handedly with a level 14 hunter who had 2k+ HP made you feel supreme.
---
But then...
---
Catch-up mechanics with free purples, nerfing hard dungeons along the way? Check.
---
Worst arena balance? Check.
---
LFR introduction? Check.
---
Xmog? Check.
---
Dumb Dragon Soul? Check.
---
Things were getting worse and they've completely fucked up everything at the end.
---
Tl;dr Early cata was great, but at the endgame it got extremely awful.
---
&gt;I don't think players will sacrifice their leveling in order to abuse the system
---
That's incredibly short-sighted and underestimating. Gold Farmers would fucking LOVE this, on top of various players. You have poor scope in view. I'm glad you aren't in DEV or QA. Lol.
---
Uwotm8? I love Sylvanas. Totally not because she's hot. She's actually a very 3 dimensional character. She's got such a complex and interesting story arc, that definitely shouldn't have ended after the lich king.
---
The weekend of release is a 3 day weekend at my company. Took 2 more days off to have 5 straight days of grinding bliss. Hopefully this is enough time for them to get their shit together server-side.
---
For buffs and heals I highly recommend using an add-on like "Clique" where you can bind heals to stuff like Alt+Leftclick on a unit-frame which doesn't require you to change your current target.
---
Also I recommend to use the best keys in terms of reachability for instant-casts while having spells that require standing still can be on less well reachable buttons.
---
I'm missing Alt in your variants, it's comfortably reachable when compared to both ctrl and shift.
---
There's also the windows-key... There's tools to rebind it and there's two of them anyways. So rebinding the left windows-key to something like ctrl makes it so that you can reach it with your thumb while keeping your other fingers around wasd, which will dramatically increase your viable ctrl-variants.
---
this prevents low lvl ganking entirely
---
Zug Zug
---
As a warrior in tbc thunderclap would only hit 4 targets, not exactly godlike aoe.
---
Jokes on you, I'll just Vanish and let you deal with your own bullshit.
---
I'd definitely enjoy crafting things for myself, but I have a really hard time levelling my profession fast enough to make any items that are actually level appropriate for me.
---
Not only that, but the really decent crafted levelling gear often requires rare/expensive materials.
---
Pservers are fun but only really dedicated players (sometimes elitists) are on them. Telling a friend to go get a weird download from mediafire and change the file manually is a lot less appealing than the "new" released game on the blizzard app. The community will be a lot more diverse and the experience will be smoother since the api is how it was intended.
---
They are the best single target healers and the nest group pvp class in the game. But it you want to dps or tank in raids then they are not for you, but that doesn't make them shit.
---
Stop it I can only get so hard.
---
And no teleporting the group directly to the dungeon. But this also greatly diminished the value of guilds. Making guilds less valuable is the reason I would remain against it even if they got rid of the teleportation factor.
---
Maybe I remember this wrong. But cats 5 man's felt like mini raids. They just took so long and eventually I had to wait forever to get grouped. Nobody wanted to do them. Compared to WoLTK, where everyone was running 5 man's constantly and the dungeons were designed better.
---
Am I thinking of something else? I seem to remember this being the case.
---
Also WoLTK was the end of a huge storyline that spanned more than one game for years. So I think lots of people were ready for a break.
---
I know UD is popular, but I would have expected many to travel to durotar on the zepplin and then continue in the barrens.  It is a little funny though.  I guess I forgot about arathin and hinterlands though, I do remember them being pretty good zones.
---
&gt; Lost count of the number of paladins who insist on watching their autoattack timer while the MS warrior is siting sheeped in a ice trap and the priest gets stunlocked to death by a rogue.
---
LOL can relate. Was that rogue. Every time that happened, I'd be wailing on them [like](https://tenor.com/view/where-did-leave-my-fucks-gif-9077982)
---
Yeah, I want to level quickly as I will be GL and MT so that I can start helping everyone else out and getting pre bis, but I dont want to go so hard that I burn out and dont enjoy the leveling experience.
---
I did the same thing.  Got on a pserver just to mess around and what not, only to be sucked in and leveling to 30.  I did the same thing as you and decided to stop there.  I'm really looking forward to release now.
---
Omg there was always those assholes who will cry for summon for 10 mins then when you do they cancel it and tell you there getting pots ready give them a min. Like bitch don’t cry for summon unless you ready to go.
---
Is there a risk that using modern engine "fix" the terrible pathing of Vanilla ?
---
There's a known 'bug' for making keys easier to farm which I found on a private server. With a good group and abuse, you could farm all 3 key bosses in 30 minutes or so. I have no idea if this was fixed on Classic, but to shed a little light, you require a Warlock, or pet class at least.
---
Bro, SpongeBob memes are sacred.
---
Yeah ok, but as long as the BiS bows/crossbows have not dropped for those hunters, the dwarf has +5 on his gun skill and he will out-dps the NE because he can focus on agi gear where that NE still has to don some +hit gear.
---
Always a bigger fish
---
I hope not. Blood elves ruined horde.
---
Very recently switched to orbweaver and g600 but I used to play with keyboard.
---
If you move your hand right and use TFGH for directional keys you have a lot of keys all around your fingers.
---
If your doing one of these, your most likely doing all of them lol
---
Because we always knew no matter what that private servers are not secure and will inevitably shut down.
---
I’ve been on four or five different Classic private servers over the past 10 or so years. You have to understand how much it sucks to watch all that work get wiped out because a server gets shut down or the population dies.
---
Retail servers won’t just disappear like that.
---
/u/GritsUI BTW Cisco Umbrella flagged the site as untrusted / malicious and blocked it outright. I would say there's something you need to look into!
---
Fewer bag spaces. Less bag space. He was correct
---
Nah, the ideal would be something like Oqueue (was that it's name?)
---
Basically group finder. Where you can look for other people who want to do the same thing and then build your own group by whispering them, telling them what you wanna do and what you expect and then forming a group yourself. 
---
And yea, limited to your server.
---
Automatic group finding is flawed from start to finish. It limits how hard content can be as Blizzard doesn't want you to feel punished when you get a sucker in your group, so they make it so easy that you can finish it with 1 competent person or 5 monkeys. Because people would rightfully complain if they got groups several times a day that cannot finish the dungeon. If you build your own group, you cannot blame that on Blizzard.
---
lol sure
---
&gt; Are we going to quit retail altogether? No, because we still love WoW and want to see wow get better than the current state that it is in right now. 
---
You will be SURPRISED at how many BfA players are prepared to leave it, for good, but they don't say it out loud, to avoid being flamed, or begged not to kill the guild, or other stupid reasons. The impact of Classic on BfA will be larger than the impact of Cataclysm on Azeroth. You just have no idea.
---
I also love WoW...but implying that playing BfA = love WoW is stupid, at best. I love WoW...but I am going to play Classic.
---
There will be a huge snowball effect in BfA, come August 27th. There are probably 10 times more BfA players hiding their intent to play Classic over BfA, than those that openly admit it.
---
Except top mythic guilds in BfA (which are maybe like 5-6% of the player base) every other guild will find itself without enough people for raiding...and not only on August 27th, but for a very long time. Long enough to create a snowball effect of migration from BfA to Classic...because the social aspect of Classic will be TOO POWERFUL to ignore.
---
I am really sorry for BfA players. I really am. But they, along Blizzard, are to blame for the state of WoW. This is what you people want, and Blizzard delivered.
---
I understand your HOPES that BfA won't have any problems, and "both games can coexist"... but this is a fantasy. Yes, both games will coexist...but one will be a desert town, while the other a booming, thriving world.
---
"People will play Classic for 2 weeks and realize that it was crap and will quit". No. Most people won't. Because they will also remember WHY they spent 10hrs/day playing Vanilla back in 2005, and why they are spending 20 minutes now playing BfA. The game is just TOO GOOD. For all the ganking, and struggling with gold, and farming...there is 10 times more reasons to STAY in Classic than LEAVE.
---
As a druid I love running up on a lock low on mana and giving them 2 hots. They can life tap all they need, and sometimes I get candy for it.
---
I wouldn’t say hate, more like a sibling rivalry
---
very nice
---
I moved to NA and played on EU for a bit. Latency wasn’t an issue but finding a guild was. Ended up buying an NA account, it was hard letting go of my stuff on retail but I got over it.
---
Knowing that your characters wont be deleted mostly. Personally I like the harder dungeons, high pop and no layering that pservers has
---
"Kick Majority"?
---
I mean I guess, but if he's insinuating that he and his 3 friends (probably all dps) can just prevent kicks he's going to learn how much fun looking for a tank or healer is in classic.
---
Hint: One of the perks of tanking/healing is near insta-dungeons because most players want dps if you play on pvp servers and there are never enough tanks/healers to go around.
---
The gear optimization is a bit teller for that as well.
---
Just do it
---
I think you're Badasslemons' alt.
---
Ping and persistence. 
---
Hard for a NA player to slog through 160 ping content knowing their character will get abandoned in 8 months for the next fresh
---
Not really. There wouldn't be just lvl60s in the main layer, other players would have to fill it up too. By the time people are reaching lvl60 the drop-off of players could already have made multiple layers redundant too.
---
No way. A lot of those drops are required for raiding. A lot of people raid weekly and they all need their consumables and resist gear etc.
---
Every week more people hit 60 that require more materials.
---
The market will never be over saturated by drops that are required for consumables and resist gear. If by some freak of nature it is over saturated, just bank them and wait a week or two until they're not as oversaturated.
---
They've been around since the early days of Warcraft. There were a ton of cheesy additions to the franchise from wc3 onward, but gnomes are og.
---
I'll hijack your thread to ask about something tangentially related:
---
At https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Rage&amp;oldid=194055#Being_Hit it says that "attacks that are blocked/parried/dodged also generate rage." Is this true? How much rage do dodges generate, for instance?
---
Group finder isn't automatic, you pick the dungeon you want to do and there's a list of groups that are looking for people. There was a LFG mechanic back then but it was clunky and hardly used.
---
[hmmmm](https://i.imgur.com/bBvMF3z.gif)
---
Mythic guilds kicked people out because the right legendary didn't drop for them...
---
Not a replacement, but I always like the animation of frostfire bolt. Can't remember exactly which expansion it was but you used to have a proc as a mage for an instant, damage boosted frostfire bolt and I loved that. Now it's replaced with flurry and I personally think that's a big downgrade.
---
I think he means add flight paths to replace the need for flying mounts. To get to those out of reach areas which require a flying mount.
---
ogres and nagas  where planned races for WoW at launch but they got cut so it would be cool if they put the races and areas that where cut from the the game in a classic+.
---
Yeah I don't care for auto-teleportation, I'm fine with the meeting stone though.
---
They are still going strong on Grand Tour
---
I was personally loving all the streamers realizing the horde doesn't heal. Theres no heals in Blood and Thunder. Just a bunch of apes charging forward and screaming WAAAAAHG!! If that don't work the horde is fucked. Lucky us then that it almost always works lol.
---
Latency really isn't that bad.
---
One problem is just timezones really, most dungeons and raids will take place around evening to night for you, so in order to really experience the game properly you have to mess up your sleep schedule immensely.
---
Pally compliments a warrior really well with all of their blessings and Devo aura. Your Mana efficient heals will cause little down time and you can pull more which is great for warriors to generate more rage.
---
The only counter argument against going pally is that you'll be fighting for green drops if you both are both DPS specs.
---
[*vanishes*](https://en.meming.world/images/en/1/17/Monkey_Puppet.jpg)
---
When people Res me items i have no problem providing them with my demonic wares and privelleges :)
---
Well, financially they're still raking in money through microtransactions but that doesn't make it a good game. As a gamer, I don't care about a games financial success.
---
In fact, as someone who appreiciates art I do not care about financial success. My favourite movie failed hard financially but it's a damn masterpiece.
---
True art does not cater to an audience. It is a form of expression for what the artist wants to express, not what the audience wants to hear, see or feel.
---
This is why classic is art and BfA is garbage. If you start trying to give people what they want you'll end up with the smallest common denominator with no place for greatness.
---
Can't argue with that. Only one with a sick mind can play a gnome.
---
I always got there early and wanted to start the raid. So I summoned.
---
I don't like the expectation that Warlocks absolutely must summon, and our guild did not have that expectation.
---
Lol have u actually seen mediocre rog/wars, they might do dmg but they just pull extra and fuck the gorup
---
I think you misunderstand what a tryhard is.
---
Kinda related, does anyone know if the Warlock death coil animation will be the new 'green trail' in classic? I remember at some point in vanilla death coil looked identical to a shadow bolt.
---
The latest time 8.2 can arrive is July 2nd. That is 9 weeks before Classic. The new raid tier will have 7 weeks of existence. And to be honest, most guilds need like what? 4-5 weeks to clear it?
---
The content drought in 8.2 will hit before Classic is released.
---
&gt; As a longtime rogue player, just CCing for days is the best thing. At worst, I'm trading 1 for 1 while my team 9v9s, so if I can do it on a healer or key dps, life is good.
---
You just know. Their isn't going to be any statement about skill after this. Always going to be. As a long time rogue player. My time is worthless. Lucky you... Now both of our times are worthless lol.
---
50 is the best number, you can't really do any abusive farming before 50.
---
Well there would still be players of all levels in that layers. When we've gotten to the point where we have 3000 lvl60s online at the same time layering will be long gone.
---
You could switch which layer is the main layer on a random timer during the night to make sure that every layer have the opportunity to be equally ganked.
---
There are solutions for everything if you try to find them.
---
Is it currently taking set bonuses into account? The default phase 1 hunter has 2/8 Dragonstalker and 6/8 Giantstalker. I *think* that the multishot damage bonus from the 8/8 T1 should be better than very minor stat differences between the helm/legs.
---
I feel like hemo would be better for premade bgs and sf better 1v1 and world pvp
---
Yeah, I always had the personal policy to head to the instance no matter what, and if I wasn't there before the lock and two other and got a summon? Dope. Otherwise, I probably saved myself and the group some time by not waiting.
---
You refresh the totems every minute or two, but I'd describe it as tedious.
---
&gt;When did I say that soulstones were not needed during raids? 
---
LOL I am iliterate. 
---
&gt; You missed huge parts of the equation when talking about soul shards, such a huge one I have trouble believing someone who ignores that SSs are needed in raid.  
---
How is that me saying you said something?
---
I pointed to your inability to do so when trying to support an argument where it is the most important aspect, which points to a low level of comprehension on the subject. 
---
Ignoring the most important aspect of the shards in your "argument" shows a lack in understanding. 
---
&gt; You came into this discussion with a chip on your shoulder, your inability to manage your soul shards is not my problem.  
---
You are the one who insulted me first, I guess you never learned to argue in a rational calm way No chip on my shoulder, until you started acting childish. I have never had an inability, I just don't enjoy being exploited by others, maybe it's a masochistic fetish on your part idk. 
---
&gt; I managed. Every other warlock I've played with managed. 
---
I very highly doubt this, just seems like make beleive BS. Look at the overwhelming amount of people who supported my original post, its such a common thing it is a meme.... Its like saying water dosent get you or anyone you know wet, its illogical.
---
&gt; i was honestly having fun with BFA, the raids are amazing.

They were in WoD, too. If an expansion offers nothing but raids, A LOT of players will be disappointed. I do like raiding and I appreciate that Blizzards raid design is still popular, but that doesn't make up for the terribly boring and short questing experience, the (imo) not so great dungeons, the awful class design (tbh not sure where they took that, I quit after the first month of BfA) and so on.
---
Do they just keep reusing the same people or do new people ever get in?
---
ofc, i was just saying there might be ppl who didnt get it
---
Reserving seems weird.
---
Your group, do what you will, but I personally can't imagine "reserving" items in a PUG.
---
Yea definitely a wake up call for me in AV testing. But one I appreciated. Really gotta think about what you’re doing.
---
Soul shards
---
Okay, then the option is to leave layering exactly how it is now since it's not going anywhere. That's worse in my opinion.
---
They are free and you dont need a invite for any of the big ones. Go look at the ”wowservers” subreddit for more details
---
My friend gets that in retail.
---
Heh, this is why Im going to love playing with the gaming community I've helped devlop over the years.  The people are going to be a little more accountable than they may normally be.
---
That was the crux of things for me with private servers. Vanilla is a time staking game and the thought of losing a well geared 60 again is enough to put me of pservers forever.
---
They're also filled with Chinese gold farmers as well.
---
Honestly, I just like scaring them. I chase them around, I stop by when I catch up. cluck cluck emote, buff and go away lol.
---
"Uh, got to go.  My cat's on fire."
---
The main thing they lack is a direct strike ability and similar tools for dps... Instead it's mostly Seal+Judge, which feels more passive (tho gives more leeway for support abilities).  They are great healers tho, and ridiculously self-sufficient.  
---
My favorite memory from vanilla was a BRD run where the group all wiped but me, due to a patrol that joined in.  We had gotten all the mobs but one elite down before the priest and I went oom, the tank dropped, etc.  
---
Fortunately I got back enough mana to put up Seal &amp; Judgement of Wisdom on that last mob, and started whittling it down.  The rest of the party thought I was delaying the inevitable, and should just die so we could regroup at the entrance and break in again.  Then I slowly got the mob down to half-health and they started cheering me on.  I eventually finished it off, got started on res'ing, and the run was great from then on.  That's a Vanilla Paladin to me.
---
just play retail and you have all those things you desire
---
Rogue - specing 5 points for Imp Sap!
---
Totally free and easy to get set up. Punch that question of yours into the ol' Googler and you'll be playing in 10 minutes.
---
If they went the OSRS route which would be pretty ballsy I think you would still get Blood Elves and Draenei. Or at least shaman/paladin on other factions. 
---
It gave paladins the freedom to let Prot be viable as a tank. Which I think was good for WoW. Druid and Paladin tanking helped the game I think. We needed more than 1 viable tank option. 
---
Flying was the misstep in BC. Over all I think it was bad for the game. LFD, LFR, CRZ and gear being meaningless from tier to tier are the other things. To me if they are going to go the OSRS route these are the pitfalls to avoid.
---
Start of BfA for me:
---
Level up, switch to Frost as Fire becomes unplayable because of crit going down rapidly while leveling, stay Frost at maxlevel because I get no fucking crit gear, get freaking bored of the frost rotation (orb, Blizzard, lance lance lance, Blizzard, lance lance lance, repeat) and quit.
---
Legion was so good with how they handled early secondary stat scaling (before adjusting it). I actually got to play my class. You cannot just make some specs super reliant on secondary stat thresholds and then omit these thresholds from the players. The fuck did they think would happen?
---
“You know tailors always make good things”
---
TBC, and I assume WotLK, begs to differ.
---
For the Lesser Magic Wand, I believe that 50-60 cloth is generally enough to level tailoring and enchanting enough to craft the wand. You should be able to get that much cloth just from levelling to 5, although if you're not lucky with the drops you may have to farm humanoids a little bit longer.
---
You can take those professions, craft the wand, then drop them for the professions you want.
---
If you're in a rush, I'd avoid involving an alt. You'll have to level them to 5, then wait an hour for them to get the mats you've mailed them, then wait another hour to get the wand.
---
Or just don't bother: I can almost guarantee that people will be selling LMW within 2 hours of launch.
---
Thanks for reply
---
Lol what?
---
I think it's fine to summon a few people.  Someone forgot their fire resist gear, forgot to buy pots, etc.  All understandable.  But when people are out farming in silithus 2 minutes before raid time because they expect to be summoned, I think that's just rude and is not being considerate to the people who put out the tiny amount of effort to be at the raid zone on time.
---
One of the biggest reasons why I’m not going Gnome is because the model is just so small. I can’t see what the hell my armor looks like. I also like the Elwynn/Westfall/Duskwood zones more (even though as a gnome you can quest in no problem) but I’m also not a fan of mechanostiders.
---
Everyone's got their own personal ethics to it I think, so I'll talk a bit about mine. Most often if I pass a lowbie randomly I will leave them alone; this isn't so much a moral thing, more that I usually have somewhere to be or something to do, and it's not worth taking the time to be a dick.
---
While leveling around similar leveled enemies, the variables are too many to count. Do I need control over the area? Do I have friends? Do they have friends? Do I think they will play nice if I do? The deep mind games that feed into this process are one of my favorite parts of the game, and I've written about them before on this sub.
---
When I go out at 60 actively seeking to gank, my number 1 objective is typically to try and force a response. I'm trying to get people annoyed enough that another level 60 will come out and fight. This means spreading the pain across a wide net, hitting as many players as you can, but also trying to stay to the same geographical area. The more targets there are, the less likely I am to kill you again, because I need people sounding the alarm that there is a ganker in X. It also means attacking guards to set of /3, but I try to avoid questgivers/vendors as much as possible.
---
In doing this, I try to keep a mental note of who I've already killed, and avoid repeat ganks where possible. I don't corpse camp (sit on top of someone waiting for them to rez) unless they do something to explicitly piss me off.  Even then I only have the patience to do it a couple times; its just not fun.
---
New people have gotten in before the previous 2 stress tests.  But, Blizzard may have enough testers at this point (and have said something like that).
---
Although the quest lines were quite easy, I thought the story line was decent enough in all zones.
---
We're going to put your strawman in Northshire Valley, where it belongs. So all of the lowbies can see it.
---
I follow that too, but don't force it on anyone. My fun is sapping them, killing their pet, then leaving. Leaves them more confused than anything.
---
I'm going to roll a paladin first as a gold farmer. Depending if I feel like raiding I might go Holy, or I may go to ret for wpvp and just buy boost runs.
---
Any plans to share the repo? I'd be willing to possibly contribute.
---
Cool. Thanks for the update fella
---
Bash is only a two point talent.
---
I hear you, but...
---
No QoL changes will be made. Once you make one minor QoL change, people will start harping for more and before you know it, we have LFR.
---
So instead, my solution for you is to think as if this QoL change was never made, and modify your gameplay habits accordingly. Keep your bags organized, utilize bank space, sell often and seek out bigger bags aggressively. This might be tedious for some, but being organized is satisfying for most.
---
Absolutely no one asked for Void Elves. Check the stats of active characters and void elves are not highly represented in end content. (this is because people level one for the achievement then abandon the thing ASAP.) 
---
People have been asking for High Elves for lore reasons for a very very very very very very very long time. Blizzard responds in a typical blizzard way by proceeding to tell people what they actually want (you think you want it but you don't!), then by putting their own weird take on what was actually requested (Blood Elves nightborne void elves).
---
They should have simply added High Elves in the first place. Not Blood elves with a half thought out reason for them to be horde.
---
Jokes on you I just let my pet tank and if that doesn't work I always have feign death
---
It's actually the one area where the class works well. Rets and enhances have non-interactive combat mechanics because their not supposed to be interacting in combat, they're supposed to be doing some passive dps while looking around for opportunities to leverage their support skills. Too bad that whole design breaks down in raids.
---
I loved Cata dungeons on release. Stonecore was practically undoable with a full LFD pug.
---
They're both time consuming, but in different ways.
---
Classic is time consuming in the sense that things take longer to do: Leveling, killing mobs, getting relevant gear. Things like that
---
Retail is time consuming because of the systems they have in store: World quests, dailies, faction rep grinds to get new sub races.
---
Is one better than the other? That's for the individual to decide
---
He doesn't meant from one expansion to the next.  He's referring to the effect of mob scaling zones.  You never feel any stronger because the mobs get stronger with you in parallel.  Also once your ding 120 you actually get considerably weaker because of it.
---
I know.
---
You wrote "Dungeon finder", though. Which is automatic and a widely used feature where you select either "random dungeon" or a specific one, get grouped up with 4 randoms, teleported to the dungeon and then do it (plus some reward for putting up with randoms I guess)
---
try that with 2 kobolds in Fargodeep mines and you'll ease back a bit.
---
I'm glad you understand what I was trying to achieve.. Thankfully, many people have now explained the weakness and strengths of paladin tanking and now I have a greater understanding.
---
Unfortunately there are plenty of people who seem unable to have a rational discussion and are more preoccupied with the tone of my post than the actual content. Guess this subreddit is just as toxic as the rest.
---
If we're solely talking about dungeons, Ret would be fine if we didn't have a pally healer because of blessings and utility.
---
Rather than release the server save files of 1.12 which they have to keep going back and checking what they've created against. They instead have tried to do a mix of several patches for debuff limits, AV, content phases, gear and class retunes etc. Thats without even mentioning layering, battlenet integration, and the fact that the whole game is attempting to recreate a vanilla experience on a 7.0 backbone rather than just release the actual vanilla experience they have for reference. And ive stressed this before some private servers have been generated by a handfull of private citizens in less time than the 2 years a multimillion dollar company with the actual files has done.
---
This came up a while ago and someone posted  [https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db/tree/master/Full\_DB](https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db/tree/master/Full_DB)
---
I personally thought that the Legendaries in legion were wayyyyyyyy too RNG
---
Private servers have been up long enough for everything "meta" to be defined, so unless blizzard changes anything in their 1.12 stuff its not gonna be much of a mystery
---

---
**PvP:** We planning on ranking as well as hosting premades to be the top Horde premade on the server competing with the Alliance.
---
**Info:** If you are interested, feel free to message myself on reddit, or leadership on discord for more information.

It was super annoying when you'd travel from like 5 zones over and look at the map and see that one of the people who was only two zones away is still running their mining path out in the middle of nowhere, having made zero effort to go towards the instance even though they were closer than anyone else.
---
I can't even imagine what the game will be like on a computer that didn't come pre-installed with Windows ME.
---
&gt; DPS wait 2 sec with dpsing
---
This. 5-mans became a breeze as a rogue once I got my head out of my ass long enough to realize this.
---
Yea but you auto attack. That's pretty much it.
---
As a healer, fuck you and you spank it tank it shit.
---
Before 60: If you're within 6 levels of me, ya dead. I'll kill you once, maybe twice if i'm trying to pressure you away from my grinding spot. If you attack me first, I kill you twice. If you kill me somehow, I kill you until you leave or at least make it impossible for you to quest/grind in that spot. 
---
At 60: I don't gank levelers because I have better shit to do. If i'm grinding honor between queues and you provide honor, ya dead.
---
Part of that is validation. Classic as an official product is an acknowledgement / validation that some of the old ways worked. That's pretty hype if you care about the future of the game.
---
Raiders have their epic raid gear that they will get, which PvPers will have a hard time getting. Though I can see the problem with 1v1 being rewarded as much as 5v5 per player. I guess that's why they reduced the arena rewards received for 2v2 and 3v3, compared to 5v5, in the arena. However, being that winner of a 1v1 must feel like a pretty cool achievement. I can only imagine how Venruki felt when he won the Classic tournament.
---
The reason I came up with this system is that the honor system is not very competitive. It's mostly very time consuming, grindy, and very repetitive.
---
What would you change/add/remove to improve this system?
---
Friend make it an Android app!
---
Why not just dps warr? Feels closest to ret at least. But then again everyone will be rolling a warr
---
Play "It's a secret to everyone" in Ungoro. I never played it thinking I could at any time, then Cata happened...
---
Authenticity
---
Surely i wasnt the one who's eyes immediately caught Commander Priestitute nickname in that chaos.
---
Thunderclap, Cleave and Shockwave.
---
More than enough to keep threat in TBC.
---
One of the major reasons I'm rolling warlock is so I can summon my party
---
Question (and forgive my ignorance here). 
---
Will layering be able to mitigate "server full" issues? I haven't requested my time off work yet but am wondering if I should take the first week (off) or wait...
---
With all the knowledge brought to the table this won't be an issue though. Progressing for everyone!
---
Crappy enough to where the horde were crying for their own.  Alliance never wanted shamans.
---
Well, if you want to refute any of thepoints let me know. I would be happy to have a rational discussion with some true back and forth.
---
When I think of the original WOW, the thing that comes to mind the most is Ironforge. It's the best city the game ever had.
---
There is barley anybody left playing bfa already. I honestly think classic is going to kill the modern game completely unless the game gets a lot better.
---
10+ was tbc vanilla was more lik 18+ 😆
---
Tarren Mill, Hillsbrad
---
MMORPG vs MMORNG
---
Played hunter in classic vanilla but main mage in retail, mage all the way this time in classic! May make a priest alt though we will see
---
They purposefully left it like that because that’s how it was in vanilla which is cool. I’ll be getting this addon though anyways so thank you
---
You can rush in the sense that you still need to cap the towers.  If you don't the buff they get is too much without great gear.
---
Yeah. Female human casting animations are pretty decent too. The 5% extra base int doesn't seem worth it to me.
---
Red = dead. Corpse camping though... NEVER, under any circumstances. It’s just a fucking tool move.
---
Hey, does this actually work or am I getting wooshed here?
---
&gt; The reason I came up with this system is that the honor system is not very competitive. It's mostly very time consuming, grindy, and very repetitive.
---
Oh, I know this all too well. The point is that while I may agree with you, raiders want to feel special for raiding and hate being ganked by skilled PvPers. People rant and rave about resilience gear even though resiliecne gear was a great thing for the game. You can't make these people happy. 
---
&gt;What would you change/add/remove to improve this system?
---
Honestly, I think Classic+ as a concept is flawed. I feel like either Blizzard needs to take lessons learned and incorporate them into Retail, or a competitor needs to release a product. Classic+ seems destined for financial failure though, at least in terms of investment matching the expected ROI compared to retail WoW.
---
Yeah, just be careful, it's more expensive to put stuff on Goblin AH. 
---
Greedy little buggers.
---
DPS’ers can be replaced.
---
Virgin Horde pvp VS Chad Alliance pvp
---
Very low.
---
Id say you have higher chances of everything being broken for a week than them deciding not to release it on that date.
---
Hi, /u/Abigfluffydoggo
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1ouxv/can_we_just_take_this_time_to_recognize_and_thank/). 
---
You also become an absolute force in wpvp
---
I've always seen it where they throw it on ML for the 1 boss that has the reserved loot. Of course this is also one of the ways people would ninja loot even when things weren't reserved and agreed upon beforehand.
---
I had to say it but this place has always been WAY worse than most reddits I have seen. When classic first came about, the conversations here were so illogical I ran and never looked back. I have interest in Classic now and want info, so I decided to look through for the occasional tidbit. But yeah, you get lots of people who will post shit that offers zero insight, and get upvotes like crazy. They will then spend WAY more effort arguing why they are right without any actual facts, but spend zero effort on meaningful discussion. 
---
I can only hope this is not representative of the majority of players that will be on Classic.
---
Let me guess... you play Alliance?
---
And rogues. I don't fancy fighting 8/10 other players for 1h weapon drops
---
Keyboard turning is a level above the rest.
---
Are you sure this applies to bgs?  I thought it was only for world pvp that there was a kill limit.  And AV really isn't good for that because the honor gets split so many ways.
---
I'm not in the beta, but it should. There was a mod like this in vanilla as well.
---
Newbs.. I just Bubble hearth
---
Nelf lol
---
I find it real odd people skip darkshore and go to Westfall. At level 10, most of the quests in Westfall are higher than your level and they are sparse. You have to go to loch Modan to balance out your lack of quests or end up grinding mobs. Darkshore is packed with so many quests that you can finish them all quickly. If people love Westfall so much, I recommend leaving darkshore at like 15 to go to Westfall and be able to flow through all of its quests without an issue
---
Source that alliance never wanted shamans / bloodlust?
---
The true test will be after launch. Right now the masses can only play vicariously through streamers and people always want what they cant have. Lets see what happens 1-3 months after launch. 
---
I am optimistic that Classic participation will exceed what Blizz expects, but I do expect it to be too overwhelming for some people.
---
Depends on many things. I was going to play rogue again but a buddy wants to so now im going kitty! But if you are scared of change or rushing to end game then play with you are comfortable with.
---
Hype ain't going nowhere.
---
This is awesome! Is there a function for PVP sets? Or can all that be applied to PVP.
---
I was like you till I got my leaf.
---
&lt;rockstar&gt; \[Alliance\]\[NA\]\[PvP\]
---
Semi-Hardcore
---
2-3 weeknights + 1 weekend TBD
---
EST 7pm-12 timeslot
---
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
\~\~\~OPEN RECRUITMENT!\~\~\~
---
**Vision:**
---
The premium semi-hardcore Classic WoW experience. This guild is designed to fit well with a working-person's schedule and have something for everyone including consistent raiding, PvP, or just chilling. We want to attract members wanting balanced community long term. This includes keeping the community cleansed of drama, pressure, and toxic players. The leadership will strive to be transparent, fair, effective at making raiding goals and group play events a reality.
---
**The Four Tenants:**
---
1. Have a Good Time: Enjoy the game and have fun with guildmates and friends. Make it so.
---
2. Achieve Excellence: During raids and PvP, play to the best of your abilities.
---
3. Be Efficient: Find creative ways to maximize the value of your time, especially when with others.
---
4. Maintain Balance: Respect everyone's real-life time and responsibilities, through keeping realistic expectations.
---
**Raid Details:**
---
The goal is to complete available raiding content in an efficient and consistent manner. This will take its special kind of form in a non-hardcore guild with more of a marathon pace. Compared to later expansions's cutting edge content, Classic success is more based on logistics and organization, versus encounter complexity.
---
Schedule: During progress, 40-man scheduled raids may operate on an up to, but not over, a 3-4 night per week schedule. During farm this may be more relaxed. Specific weeknights will be determined based on the needs of the guild and planned ahead of time. Two raid teams per instance may be planned each week (for example, Team 1 and Team 2). This allows more better flexibility in scheduling and higher loot yield. For example, if you can't make Wednesday+Thursday, you can join the other team's raid. The 2nd team will be enabled by a broad roster of willing raiders and alts.
---
Classes: When class choice or performance is becoming a liability, it will be evaluated on a case by case basis. For alt or farm raids, it shouldn't matter as much.
---
Loot awards: A well-run loot council system will give equipment to characters that would benefit the long-term position of the guild in scheduled raids. The council will track loot and thusly have data on historical awards to ensure fairness is part of the decision.
---
Alts: Having an alt character available for raiding is encouraged. This will make running two raid teams per week per instance more achievable.
---
Grouped PvP will be part of the guild's experience. Groups should be going on a regularly on off-nights, and is a great time to show off your shiny new gear! Organized PvP gives great exposure to the guild om the server.
---
**Guild Master 'about me':** 
---
Former veteran of US-first raid guilds Vodka and Blood Legion, between WotLK and WoD. Coming back to Classic as it's a more relaxed and social environment! Using the leadership skills learned over the years and in-depth game experience, am developing a guild from the ground up that shares my vision and can sustain as a home for like-minded players.
---
**Discord:**
---
[https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ](https://discord.gg/ep83vAJ)
---
Find an online admin/officer and to start a conversation about your interest in the community. We are looking for various levels of involvement: officers, raiders, PvP-er's, and casual players.
---
They can in a five man easily, though the druid is much better at tanking for those than healing or doing dps.
---
&gt; and basically never get picked over the guild leader's pocket team of best friends IRL.
---
That's the real issue, not being a snowflake.
---
True. Unless they aim for a completely bug free game, I also think that highly unlikely that they will delay launch.
---
I feel like the nature of it being basically AV only would cause people to skew heavily to arguably the best ranged pvp class in the game, though. Not a great representation.
---
The first rank is given for getting the minimum amount of kills you need to get to be part of the ranking system, which is 15.
---
Everything above that is based on brackets and you lose 20% of your total ranking points every week before what you earned is added.
---
So basically, every week your ranking is current RP\*0.8 + RP earned that week. 
---
Obviously if the 20% decay is more than what you've earned you lose ranking points.
---
Ranking points are based on which bracket you are in.
---
Yeah, agreed. Rolling human male though. Need my big shoulders
---
Paladin has incredibly simple output, both DPS and healing. Their supportive spells and tankiness is what makes them fun.
---
At least in pvp Shadow Melts faces. It or warlock is the strongest stand alone pvp class.
---
"Average joes" should be the name
---
I’m taking days off but not all in a row. 2 weeks in a row is over kill and you’ll feel like shit. Taking tuesday-Thursday off for 4 weeks is better. One day of work between 3 days played is much better.
---
Rough spot in general. I played paladin in Vanilla. I always wanted more viable DPS/Tank specs. I have been a Prot paladin main since BC. Unless they buff these specs(which is a bad idea imo) I can’t see playing them.  If I alt a paladin I will be holy or Tri Spec.
---
Classic was what it was. Ret did fine in PVP and sure when things got on farm you could do the raids with less healers so Off Specs are more of an option. But I’m tanking for my guild so I’m going to main Warrior for the first time in 14 years not playing paladin.
---
&gt; Classic will not affect retail much.
---
Only because it's already so dead. There are so few groups in the group finder for raids and arena when compared to legion it's insane.
---
I think the reason people still loved the game in wotlk is because atleast the story still mattered.. We were fighting the lich king, the main antagonist of the story. Once he was defeated, then people really started to critique the game and its mechanics. Also, even during wotlk, there were many players who did not like the direction the game was going in and were wishing for the vanilla days again
---
Raid consumable BiS
---
I’m not saying ret wouldn’t be fine, I’m saying if I have the choice between a ret and a better melee dps I’m bringing the latter.
---
They are free, but does require a little finesse to set up properly.  Some servers have announced they will be shutting down as soon as Classic is live.
---
Keep in mind though that private servers are illegal.  None of them have the right to be running the game at all which is why you cannot stream vanilla on twitch from the private servers.  And blizz hasn't gone after any of the players or host and it is unlikely they ever will at this point - but just something to be aware of.
---
Yup. They can see we all have pitchforks. No way will they delay it.
---
And it's not even 100%
---
If Blizzard can keep their servers running smooth in the first week, it would be amazing, if not it's hell. I would take off the week after the first week to get all the kinks out. It'll take most people a month or two to 60 anyway.
---
Loves stone core. Still one of my favorite dungeons
---
**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **(RP)-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
**Raid information**
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---

Why would delaying it make it more or less likly for people to get off work at this point?
---
I don't disagree, but sometimes people do have legitimate reasons to be late. The only thing the raid leader wanted is that nobody was summoned before on-time DKP was sorted out.
---
Once that is done, the people who have done the right thing are the ones really being punished by having to wait. I never saw summoning people as being a bad thing. If I used most of my shards then I would spend the first bit of the instance recovering soul shards, the raid leader understood and I never felt that useful on trash anyway.
---
Personally I'd run this. Swiftmend is really powerful, also lets you be a full fledged earlier. A lot of the balance points are pretty meh in comparison (better moonfire damage or insane survivability in Swiftmend?). If you are Nelf you only need 3 points in the Stealth talent as your racial will upgrade your stealth.

This man knows what's up.
---
That's a gross oversimplification which should be ignored as you've not contributed to the conversation anything near equal value.
---
Just look how underwhelming the new sets look. Blizzard knows they don't even have to try anymore.
---
Topic is literally about dungeons where everything is different, though, with a necessity to have hybrids be hybrids in order to get groups assembled quicker. But thanks for bringing up a completely unrelated environment just to toss out some holier than thou shit.

thats currently how it works on beta

Will be maining a gnome.

Planning on /boop-ing all the wittle hordes before killing them. (L
---
This is a viable pvp build, for pve it’s not great. A few adjustments though:
---
- Balance tree: 1) go for improved wrath, you should use it quite often and the half second matters a lot. 2) you don’t need all the points in nature’s grasp, if a melee/pet is hitting you a lot and you have ~65% proc rate, it’ll go off in two hits or so. 3) you don’t need improved roots. If a melee is hitting you out of bear form, you’re doing something terribly wrong. Just stun, root and run away. Perhaps useful against pets but that loss is acceptable imo.
---
-Feral tree: 1) you don’t need feral instinct, you should be way clear of anyone and when you attack, you go straight at them for the pounce, there shouldn’t be any danger of being detected, and threat is useless in pvp. 2) The movement speed of feline swiftness can be useful against casters, but I usually don’t spend much time in cat form after my dash wears off anyway so i prefer putting those two points elsewhere. 3) I recommend going for the improved Bash and Pounce, that one extra second is a life saver. 4) go for the extra armor, 3 points in it just to get to the next tier is worth it as you’re gonna spend a lot of time in bear form against melees. 5) Like what was said above, go for improved crit in forms, full 3 points, I prefer this over feline swiftness. 
---
- Resto tree: 1) I always go for full MotW; it’s an awesome buff and a 35% boost is even more awesome. 2) I get why the points in Nature’s Focus but it’s not that useful. You should never be casting with a melee hitting you, and against casters you’re gonna heal with Rejuv and once a NS+HT, for a second HT heal I use barkskin or just LoS them. I prefer a more offensive build and put those 5 points in improved Wrath. To get to NS, you can still put that one point that you need in Nature’s Focus, or even in Reflection for a 5% boost to your mana regen while spamming your wrath.
---
Overall, good build and not a bad idea to mix it up like this and take full advantage of your versatility. If you play it right, your ability to go from caster dps to healer to tank to melee dps should constantly force your opponent to adapt their game.
---
You’re better off using an alt for alch than losing herb on your best toon for farming.
---
did they get rid of the attunement that were in bfa? Because bfa had at least 2 dungeons you had to attune to.
---
No you must pay him if he fails repair bills and such.
---
Scatman John
---
I stopped playing a week after bfa came out. I was getting kicked from groups for not knowing the dungeons. Every group I joined was just speed running through. I just pvped until I quit playing.
---
If there's any gear disparity at all, the mage is probably toast after the BS, given crits. Honestly, outside of hemo being way less fun than dagger, having ambush in your toolkit, especially to open on mages, is really, really nice. CS is worthless against a good mage, and garrote probably isn't gonna help that much before you get kited to death.
---
There's tons of good DPS gear, what are you smoking?
---
I'm likely going male just because if he's my main I'd feel weird playing a female. Females are for novelty alts lol.
---
So you can’t find fault in my argument and just decide to pussy out? Ok, fuck off then.
---
The Ol' Slippery Slope
---
And look at that bonus honor!  Way more efficient doing it like that.  Only good thing about the long AVs is that you get a ton of HKs which wont matter til they come out with the 100k title.
---
Be careful which you pick a lot are pay to win
---
*cue vanilla tavern music* *turn up to max volume*
---
thats like saying raiding is dumb, none of it matters
---
My stuff was all on imageshack, and over the years they ended up just deleting the images I had on my account :(.  The latest stuff I have on my harddrive are from wotlk.
---
Then you condense everyone interested in the same quest hubs and profession nodes. Level restrictions for layers is just a bad idea.
---
Chain poly and chain fear are my nightmare.
---
totally disagree with you.  You can buy Brown Bags from the Vendor (10 lot bag) for 25 silver. Or get a guildmate to make them for you. Small Silk bags are 10 slots, and Mageweave bags are 12 slots.  
---
Even at low level, a guild mate can craft 6 slot linen bags or 8 slot woolen bags for very simple mats.
---
Tnx
---
There's still like a 5GB download to get the client tho...
---
You already had no mana when the extra shit was pulled. Thats why we stop and let you drink. But then someone decides it takes too long and pull shit, expecting the group to carry on, because the DPS is ready, but you are not.
---
They had it in beta :(
---
I honestly think as long as you bring something to the table, either shaman totems or paladin blessings or druid innervate, then bring your best man. 
---
Classic raids aren't /that/ hard as long as you got a team doing their best.
---
Yeah I’m talking about lvl 60, which is where most players spend most of their time.
---
If people only picked classes based in leveling there would be more warlocks.
---
Just pound Adderall XR's and you won't be hungry.
---
2,  plus a respawn when you're out of mana/health.
---
You're free to take a week off work regardless of whether they delay the release or not.
---
I don't understand your point, OP. If you want to take a week off, do it
---
Retail is a shitshow but we should remember there are real people who did their best on it. Just like anywhere else, the people doing the grunt work probably weren't the ones making the decisions that have made the game a shadow of its former self. To all you behind the scenes blizzard folks out there who are doing their best within the confines of their job, we know what happened to the game is not your fault.
---
Warlock - the humans have the coolest trainer location and I do not appreciate that.
---
&gt; and after August will be on the line of : "Fuck me...Classic actually DID killed BfA".
---
More like "BFA commited suicide". Do you seriously believe that BfA - the worst expansion so far, generally hated by both hardcore players and casuals, is a serious competitor for Classic? You could replace Classic with literally any other expansion (*maaaybe* besides WoD) and the statement would still remain true
---
&gt; more than half of the already very low population of BfA will play Classic as their MAIN GAME
---
No offense but that's pretty much impossible unless Blizzard decides to destroy Classic by implementing all QoL changes known from Retail
---
Awesome, thanks man!
---
I will find you and I will corpse camp you.
---
And hunters.
---
Haha just realized we’re talking on two different comment threads LOL. Sounds like we’re both going mage!
---
Same here and it was honestly a blast! I ended up running the DKP for our Guild, we had an amount for turning up on time, an amount for sticking til the end and an amount per boss kill.  There was some real motivation for those initial 25-30 guys to clear a couple bosses before the full raid turned up :D
---
The amount of shit they'd get if they launch with issues pales in comparison with the amount of shit they'd get if they delayed the release date.
---
Wow diary?
---
Okie dokie. (:

Being locked to Tauren.
---
I am also talking about dungeons. Sorry but not everything is about raiding.
---
&gt; But thanks for bringing up a completely unrelated environment just to toss out some holier than thou shit.
---
Fuck off retard.
---
Unless you are a spell power hunter. Good luck getting your raid to let you serpent sting though lol.
---
I met my husband because of soul shards! He joined our MC raid. I farmed 70 soul shards before the raid and he shows up 10 minutes late with 11 soul shards. I sent a very strongly worded message about being prepared and not to make the rest of us look bad. 3 years later we got married.
---
If you're going to take a day or days off work to play. I HIGHLY suggest NOT to pick the first few days.
---
If any of Blizzards launches are to be used as a reference, then the first two days if launch will be filled with server resets and possible downtimes.
---
Nothing's worse than having the day off and then sitting and looking at a message saying "Servers will be back up in 3 Hours....4 Hours....6 Hours."
---
There isn’t gonna be any big shake up. Viability in classic is purely a numbers/scaling thing. You just don’t have the numbers to compete with a warrior and as such you will be behind in itemization always since nobody is gonna give you gear over the warriors.
---
/spit
---
PvE is boring af.
---
Even more reason to get the aggro and not make us wipe, even if it's the dps fault.
---
I agree as long as you can get this signed off! I'm not restricted on leave but for other consultancies you wouldn't be allowed to have one day on, 3 days off - depends on the kind of work I guess!
---
They won’t delay it. They have a release timer on their site.
---
No, I just don't care to argue with frothing neckbeards....
---
There is a neck piece attainable during the Dungeon Set 2 questline that is very comparable to the In Dreams quest reward. Beads of Ogre Strength or something like that. Although I have no idea when Dungeon Set 2 will be available in classic.
---
I think most peoples fear of playing on a pvp server is completely irrational, it really is not as bad as some make it out to be.
---
What's your opinion on troll vs. undead?
---
I'm hearing a lot of good things about Shadowguard + blackout, and that classic is going to have so many paladins that devouring plague loses some of it's effectiveness.
---
Just flag yourself for PvP.
---
Beard growin', moved back into mom's basement, acne coming in real nice, everything near me is in a pre-classic coat of greasy body oils, gamer funk is starting to crawl out of the basement onto the landing, soon to invade the kitchen. 
---
It's gonna be lit
---
I am starting to see an interesting component of how much more widespread knowledge is now then back during Vanilla. 
---
This kind of shit was POSSIBLE back then. Hell, maybe some people even did it. But it wasn't common knowledge, it wasn't well documented and wasn't being spread as the standard to live by. This is something that occurs now because knowledge is so easy to find, and so organized, that the absolute top of the line possibilities are easily taken by the masses as the bare minimum. 
---
This is similar to what most players do for live and is why balanced kind of adjusted for that. Players all collect and compare data until they know the 100% best way to approach everything numerically and thus cause that to be the gold standard, then consider anything less inferior. In Vanilla, this wasn't the case. Most people considered that excessive and often never even bothered to look at it. Or just didn't know. 
---
The concept of stacking all these worlds buffs like this likely never passed someone's mind as a standard. Now people see it is possible and just assume it WILL become standard because thats how games are now. 
---
I wonder how this mentality change is going to further affect the Classic experience.
---
Think it depended on what realm you were on, if someone did it on my realm they got laughed and mocked. And it seems more realms ran on the same principle. 
---
I'm not strictly against reserve runs, I'm just curious on how it will be in 2019 when we'll be playing Classic again. Principles collide?
---
Is classic on top?
---
That's... That's the implication point of my post...  I was comparing layering to LFG in that they effect the world in similar ways.
---
If I was multiboxing horde and alliance, and I got in the same match, I would still somehow manage to loose with both.
---
Hunter - Have to spend gold to dps.
---
I remember shadow being fun and strong (no idea if it will be now), but I think that reading on it and finding out it doesn't scale, + the fact that I'll almost never get gear for it makes me very annoyed and almost liable to roll warlock instead so my PVP life isn't completely trash.
---
Fuck 'em, my friends are bitching about PvP too but I'm ditching everyone that doesn't want to play PvP or Alliance.
---
Warrior - soloing is heck because you have no heal and downtime is far more deterimental to you than everyone else
---
Paladin - you don't get to tank once you hit 60
---
Incredibly boring at least.
---
If you want to make gold, avoid doing what everyone else is doing. Take that crafting profession. The number of people who think double gathering is the way to level is too damn high. The competition for nodes will be extreme and prices for materials will be super low because of that. Look around on classicdb.ch or wowhead classic. Find out what quests require items made from leatherworking and make a lot of those. Also look at some high value items that players might drop a gold or two on while leveling(particularly 40+). Theres a recent thread someone posted about +frost damage gear and most of it is crafted. Mages will be a very popular class....
---
To bad that the feeling is the same as walking through one of those Chinese ghost cities that mirror Paris, or New York, or other city with amazing architecture.
---
Just play 1 of ever class, ez.
---
I believe you've all met my fitness consigliere...Me'Shell.
---
They announced 100 days ahead of release.  If you couldnt get the time off I dont know what to tell you.
---
That's part of Blizzard fucking up with making far too rapid ilvl progression part of the game too. In Vanilla and TBC there was nothing wrong with having sub-levelcap blue gear from dungeons while starting on the first raids. It was completely expected in fact; Vanilla didn't even have the option of finding lvl 60 blue gear, and TBC's Heroics really weren't tuned for fresh 70's, and were also reputation/key gated as well.
---
WotLK was where Blizzard completely fucked this game's difficulty curve.
---
I'm going to use the world 10th kills here as my metric, because the 10th best guild is much less of an outlier and is a decent representation of this game's ulta-hardcore playerbase.
---
TBC released on Jan 16th 2007
---
10th Nightbane kill: Feb 6th 2007 (couldn't find data for Malchezzar but would assume at least 1-2 weeks later)
---
10th Gruul kill: Feb 10th 2007
---
10th Magtheridon kill: March 12th 2007
---
WotLK released on Nov 13th 2008
---
10th Kel'Thuzard kill: November 17th 2008
---
10th Sartharion kill: November 17th 2008
---
10th Malygos kill: November 18th 2008
---
Those numbers say more than I could possibly try to. We went from a game where some of the best players in the world took 2 months to kill one of the launch bosses, to a game where the hardcore players were able to hit level cap and clear the newest raid tier in THREE DAYS. And every single boss died on raid #1...many of the guild members weren't even level capped yet.
---
The WotLK 5 man "Heroics" were even more laughable. I remember already AoE pulling them when I dinged 80 and basically just snoozing through them as a loot/badge farm.
---
TBC's Heroics were nerfed and still weren't even that easy in T6 gear over a year into the expansion.
---
Wrath ruined so much about WoW that I'm actually starting to resent how much people talk about it like it was some kind of golden age of the game. The artwork and the setting was amazing, it revolved around Arthas which many people were excited about, the actual raid encounters were often amazing and brilliantly done...but many core principles of WoW were completely thrown out and started us down the path we're currently on. LFG, easy as fuck difficulty, ilvl overload, epics inflation (dropping like candy even in 5 mans), cleave PvP, class homogenization, I could go on and on.
---
I did it at release. My brother lived in the states and he send me the US game, so we could play together. Raiding was tough....normally starting at 11pm for me midweek. 
---
When he moved back, we persevered for a while, still raiding hard core several times a week, but it became too hard. When tBC was announced, we re-rolled on the EU server and got into a good guild for when the portal was opened, so leveling the playing field. 
---
We both had good PCs and the latency was never a problem, and I got to Rank 12 also, playing on the US servers.   Its all down to the PC you're playing on really.  
---
When I used to play during the early evening, the server was very quiet! If I played on the weekend (mornings), it was just dead (as it was like 4am server time).
---
The slippery slope is what got WoW to where it is now.
---
So you're the rage quit type. You can leave with the DPS. Hope your raids do well.
---
Objectives? Sorry, but me not that kind of Orc.
---
Deep shadow priest is comfortably the best 1v1 class in the game. Disc healers are insane and still have godly 1v1. And you are just the meta healer in raids.
---
Hunter- i wish i had one or two more stable slots. The pets i plan to get in classic will take all my pet slots and ill have to release a pet so i can learn rank 6 lighting breath when ZG comes out.
---
&gt; best single target healers
---
That's the truth. If you are running the flag in WSG, they are *the* healer you really wanna see helping you out.
---
Its true. I'm a reddit noob, and cannot figure out how to edit it from the ap.
---
If you think me explaining that some classes run out of mana quickly makes me a “frothing neckbeard” that sounds like an issue on your part. I’m not the one who goes through peoples comments to find a fault in their character because the argument I was having didn’t pan out in my favour.
---
Go be a fucking creep somewhere else.
---
Hahahahah
---
Are you thick? OP wants to take a week of IF AND ONLY IF the chance for a delay in release is low.
---
I can give you the answer already; you'll never beat Vaelastrasz the Corrupt.
---
Your guild may be able to hobble through MC after sufficient grinding for gear, and I suspect it could even down Razorgore, but Vael will break you.
---
 .   Don't     .
---
Plenty of pvp action on PvE realms in vanilla, just no ganking
---
r/PETA
---
Does anyone know if front stabbing works in the beta?
---
The amount of players that were logged in day 1 in vanilla is not even in the same realm of people that will log in this time. It will completely dwarf the number back then.
---
Blizz could just make 500 servers with no layering, but in a month when half of those are dead and in 3 months with 400 are dead, they would have to fuck up everything and merge all the dead servers.
---
Or they could just do layering.
---
Just because your guild was a certain way doesn't mean nobody wanted it. People in my guild did. Others did too.
---
Oh awesome. My situation is a bit different, in the sense that I would only be temporarily living in EU, but it would be right at launch and a few months after. I just don’t want my friends to get too far ahead of me lol, so I was thinking of just playing when I can while in EU and coming back to the states
---
Mained a mage in Vanilla and TBC. Will be going warlock this time around.
---
pservers are free and there are quite a few players there with the "I would never pay $15/month for this game."
---
Classic will filter those people out.
---
Irrelevant. Take the week off with confidence.
---
&gt;The start time will be announced tomorrow by Blizzard
---
I'm in work training until 5pm PST. let's hope for a late one this time :P
---
My first character was on a pve server and I regretted it for sure.  Whereas yes, getting ganked sucked... but that's why that once you lived through the pain of it and get to 60, you can go back and take your frustrations out on people you've never crossed before.  Eye for an eye bitches, no remorse, no mercy.
---
But really, on my first play through, the part that made me regret being on a pve server was the experience of participating on my first alliance town raid when I was probably level 30 or 40 ish.  The fact that they needed to attack me first before I could retaliate really made the whole thing seem extremely wack and out of place.  
---
I would compare pvp and pve experience to this.  PvP servers is like playing no limit Texan holdem.  PvE is playing 2/4 limit.
---
Its not a fear. Its a lack of desire.
---
I personally do not enjoy pvp. Its not that i dread being ganked or whatever, its just that it provides me nothing i like while also giving me risk of dying/wasting time. Essentially extra risk with zero additional reward.
---
Multiplayer means both competitive and cooperative. Some like both. Others only like one. Its almost like there's different people out there.

In my circle of friends and discord servers, more and more people are sticking their heads back into retail to take the edge off.  For the most part they feel they are behind the curve and are only there to maybe mess around in BGs and not get serious, because they want to go full no life in August.
---
This is even better than the original, but now you need to add a third character: The Chad fully twinked Woyer who just charges in and melts everything before the rest of the DPS and group even catches up.
---
So triggered. Sorry I don't want to play with you.
---
2 months plus 10 fking days :(
---
The virgin “leave lowbies alone” vs the chad “gank and corpse camp until it turns into a massive pvp showdown”
---
You make a fair arguement right there.
---
Lol...why
---
I would rather drop my friends than playing on a PvE server.
---
Imagine not being able to mortal strike that mage to hell that has been stealing your mobs
---
To play the retail version, yes. For classic a subscription will be enough.
---
&gt;got nothing in return
---
Except a C&amp;D notification from Activision
---
Meeting stone summoning is OK in my book. You're still required to find a party and still have ganking opportunities.
---
I’m worried I’m going to get burnt out by just constantly browsing r/classicwow and then in August I’ll be over it all without even starting lol....
---
Human mage no less

---
I’m not talking about raids (which I think are fun) - I’m talking about the normal pve servers. No danger at all.  Takes the war right out of Warcraft imo. But to each their own. 
---
Just clarifying that.
---
Never played on a pve server but now I‘m gonna join one. My time will be limited this time around. 90% will be raiding+farming during this time I wanna chill. I think circumstances and mindset changed during the 14 years ago...
---
I am talking about the potion only. I remember killing a t2 rogue with my frost mage at level 59. But i got killed in seconds on my rank 10 mage by a rogue using FAP. FAP + sprint + slows on me was enough.
---
My main was a Paladin in vanilla. I'm tempted to go Paladin again but I think this time I want a less painful leveling experience. Plus, it seems all my friends want to go Horde this time.
---
I used to abuse this in WSG to point at the flag carrier, since it worked if you were out of range or line of sight. Hope they bring it back
---
Absolute ZERO.
---
Noone ever said mmo is simple and that UI is so bad.
---
Because not everyone wants to play on a provate server. I play in one right now but just to check some stuff out for when classic releases. If it wasnt for classic i would have never set a foot on a private server.
---
Controversial opinion!
---
And do what? Peacefully travel to opposite friendly faction to fight those who do the same? How is it different from dueling?
---
No idea why people used to use all of that. I had 1 addon back in the day, and it was just for quests.

&gt; Essentially extra risk with zero additional reward.
---
The reward is, I get to kill those fuckers without rules and limitations.
---
I was a main tank in a 40 man raiding guild and even I only used threat meter and DBM.
---
This is insane
---
I agree that's why I point out in the second paragraph that I think the ranking among the top will be essentially the same, I'm interested in seeing how far lower the others will be. I've seen pserver data but I don't really like to use it in comparisons because it's performance records based on kinda close eyeballed server side data. Just the fact that something small like differing armor values among bosses can vastly change these statistics you're relying on.
---
And again, I don't think these hybrid classes will complete with pure DPS classes.
---
4 minutes for 2770 ppl, I think that's not bad!
---
Some of them. There are multi rank 1 players who twink on the side for fun or just switched because max level sucks now.
---
There are a couple factors that point towards the active sub count being under 3 million though they do involve guess work since sub count isn't public. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFogWej65mQ&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Thing is, some people (like you) enjoy pvp. Some people (like me) don't. Its not about risk and reward, its about the fact that even at the best time, i would not enjoy pvp. So why go to pvp server if i dont enjoy pvp?
---
Like you said, to each their own.
---
Im pretty sure the keyring is in Classic. It was added in patch 1.11.
---
But there's also free Pepsi Max and Hotpockets in the fridge!
---
Stay there, you've got 2 weeks.
---
Thanks, makes sense!
---
Having a second healer or second tank on a moments notice is a great thing in a situation where someone ninja pulls a patrol pack. Plus BoF/BoP/buffs!
---
In b4 lvl 49 Devilsaur farming groups form.
---
But does it *actually* make less room? A little premature to worry about BfA content crowding the sub before the actual servers are released. If it’s still going on in 4 months, then we’ll have an actual issue.

I employ a 4 step process for helping people learn how to run dungeons while I'm tanking or healing.
---
1. It's my fault: "sorry I'm having a hard time tanking/healing these pulls. Be careful."

2. It's our fault: "hey, can we focus the same target, we'll get this done a lot quicker that way"
---
3. It's your fault: "stop pulling threat, it's going to get you killed."
---
4. Let them die.
---
Yes on wowisclassic.com under warrior 1-60 guides
---
I'd still rather PvP as any other caster, or heal as any other healer.
---
I'm not contesting that they are good.  Just that they don't appeal to me.
---
Almost 0
---
Who buys this crap though?
---
Why is everybody so sure that player won't ruin wow if they are allowed to choose what is implemented or not?
---
Remember cataclysm? How blizz tried to make the PvE to be TBC2 and everybody was upset because they couldn't faceroll dungeons, healer needed to manage their mana, dps their aggro, etc?
---
When you let players choose you end up with a expansion like cataclysm, a expansion that everybody hated at some point.

Huzzah! A man of quality.
---
i mean if he's new, and i repeatedly tell him to "please stop doing that" and he doesn't, the dungeon isn't gonna be enjoyable for anyone in the group. I don't mind helping new people but they need to be willing to listen and learn
---
Mob tagging was very much a thing in the stress test, whoever tagged got sole credit.
---
In vanilla the majority of people on my server who twinked did so because they couldn’t handle the complexity of level 60 PvP. They felt better about themselves destroying ungeared players at level 19 as a rogue.
---
What do you mean about the lack of good dps gear? 
---
They are the most gear dependent class in the game but also the highest dps. 
---
Do you see the correlation?
---
Which is exactly how I felt when I played on pve.  The rules to engagement made the whole thing feel pretty lame.
---
No limit holdem vs 2/4.  That's what pvp vs pve is.  Not the same.
---
I played ret in vanilla, towards the end I had some pretty good gear (T.2.5 and untamed blade). It was OKAY in pvp, but good players will laugh at you. You have no interrupt (kick, counterspell, etc) and no instant strike. Those problems only gets solved in TBC/Wotlk with crusader strike, divine storme and rebuke. In vanilla, if you get warrior gear, you go oom after like one heal and a few dispels. And its all RNG waiting on auto attack timer. Also, i hated my life in raid cause even if you have lots of DKPs, the guild won't let you bid on DPS gear. You will always be lowest priority, even behind hunter/tank for 2 handers like asscandy, and healer for +spell damage gear. One word of advice, if your'e deadset on playing a DPS pal in pvp. Go for shockadin. They"re great in T2 and ZG trinket. Also you have a pretty good chance to get your hand on Hand of Sulfuras cause mace spec aint that great for warrior and hunter can't use maces.

Plan ahead and freeze the prepped crock pot meals. You can grab one in the morning while you're on a flight path, pop in in the slow cooker, and it'll be ready for lunch and still hot for dinner.

So many milliseconds...

Seemed to fit the [leper gnome](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Leper_gnome) theme!
---
Yeah Vashj'ir is still my favorite zone of the entire game. I was baffled when I heard how many people disliked it.
---
Yes thats blizzards way of trying to balance it. /s
---
They intended that a group should be equal amount of every class ;)
---
Yep that's the case for some twinks. But your post made a generalization about all twinks.
---
This is neither here or there.
---
Druid -- no normal rez

I was debating between doing this or reading through Wow chronicles 1. Finishing up book 1 so I will probably install soon ;p

Druid?

---
Thanks for reply. I also reckon that Alliance have more advantages but in the end, I still kinda like Tauren a whole lot. I might decide on the day itself honestly.
---
I don't know about Hunters but Warrior regen is nuts.
---
What am I gonna do...
---
Someone, hibernate me.
---
He's very particular about his innervates. There is a system.
---
This is part of why healing is by far my favorite role. You control the fate of everyone in the group.
---
You got a good 2 years before any expansion will be added, may as well enjoy it.
---
Classic+ is new content that keeps Classic...Classic. Just with new content. No new races, no new nothing.
---
It’s also frankly just *fun* to destroy ungeared players.
---
I hate to be that guy. I still love 60 pvp, but I can’t lie to myself and say I didn’t feel a lot of glee going 30-0 in WSG on a hunter twink.
---
Assuming they go down the "Classic+" route, I'm pretty sure they would stick with the core concepts of Classic, meaning no new classes/races and no invalidating other content (ie: no easy "catchup" dungeons that award AQ gear). 
---
Instead, I imagine that they'd release dungeons/raids that award niche gear or side-grades/items that allow different playstyles without breaking the game (stuff like additional meme spec gear, for example).
---
If I do go pally, I'll only be levelling with my warrior friend so I'll probably level holy to make dungeon healing easier and have less competition for loot drops
---
I am completely convinced that mining and herbalism are traps at launch. There are sooooo many people and so few nodes that you won't be able to level your skill dependable before outleveling the zones. I'd say take gathering professions or professions that don't require mining or herbalism that don't require hitting nodes, such as enchanting, tailoring or skinning for money, and then drop them and go back later to level them after the initial push dies down
---
Or it could be swamp of sorrows snowflake ultimate hardcore ironman
---
This is why I would like a few improvements to WoW Classic before release. Small things. Like a taunt for Paladins. More mana regen for Shadow Priests. Etc. Nothing that would destroy the game. Just improve fundamental problems in a class' design.
---
That actually sounds very good, adding the "real" allied races from lore instead of pulling them out of their arses
---
Quick bug note: I plugged in a level 1 tauren restro shaman, and the websites having a *really* tough time auto-filling. 
---
Otherwise a really neat system! I'm planning on using it to track my group of 5's gear / progress!
---
To the downvoting Twinks, I know the truth hurts, but it’s still true.

---
Consider yourself faded.
---
Class homogenization didn’t get bad until WoD.
---
MoP actually had the balance right between removing bloat spells and keeping class identity, easily the best class design we’ve had in WoW. Blizzard took a genuinely caring approach to class design and it showed.
---
I would love to see what WoW would be like with vanilla gameplay and a MoP-like approach to class design.
---
Right you still gotta respec though.
---
The idea of the addon is to show a list of steps in-game in a similar manner as you would find it on a website. The addon will update the progress automatically as much as possible (quests picked up / completed, quest items looted / mobs killed, etc). Only for some steps completion has to be confirmed manually (such as resupplying, getting new skills, etc). Locations referenced in the guide are shown on the map and minimap.
---
Since it is a rather lightweight addon (I don't plan on adding exact routes to walk or telling which mob to pull etc) and since I rely on using already  existing well-tested guides finishing it until classic launch (hopefully) won't be too hard. Much of the work on the addon is done already and I plan on having it released before launch day containing at least one complete guide for 1-60 Horde and Alliance.
---
What do you guys think of it?
---
Would you use it? If not why not?
---
Right now I am searching for guides to include in my addon.
---
Warlock - Bag space
---
True. Whenever I was following the flag runner in WSG, it was basically a "that flag runner is getting the flag home and there is jack shit you jerks can do about it". 
---
Unless half the horde team jumped only 2 of us, that runner was going home.
---
For not knowing what the F*** to do!
---
How did you feel about priests? I played a mage and hunter back in vanilla and TBC. Never tried a support or healing class. I’m afraid that I’ll hate the endgame by always having to look at health bars go up and down over and over. But then again it may be way more fun to actually play the class than to see people streaming priest gameplay. Thoughts?
---
It would be nice if your website was able to be used without an account. I know you need to make money somehow, but maybe running Ads instead of selling data is the better option here.
---
You could create links to the sets/characters as an option, but maybe provide the ability for people to login and save sets. I just would prefer the ability to use your site without needing to create an account.
---
&gt;"Not everyone who plays on a PVP server is an asshole, but every asshole will play on a PVP server."
---
Further supported by the fact that you never see PVE players complain about PVP realms, but you CONSTANTLY see PVP players complain about PVE realms.
---
&gt; 10th Nightbane kill: Feb 6th 2007 (couldn't find data for Malchezzar but would assume at least 1-2 weeks later)
---
We almost killed Malchezaar in our first raid week but he bugged and got stuck in his enrage phase (so after the wipe we pull and he was instantly in enrage for the entire fight). We STILL almost got him but we simply weren't geared enough. Still though, the difficulty felt awesome. It was a 10 man raid so it was much easier to get an elite group going than with a 40 man raid. It certainly didn't feel like that almost-clear was handed to us.
---
Paladins could use all their undead abilities on forsaken. Turn undead, exorcism, holy wrath. BUT, undead couldn't be feared ever. I'm not sure about polymorph but I think forsaken were immune to poly as well.
---
That's what I was asking thanks. I posted the Video as example. When I tested things, I couldn't find any time efficency gain doing what he does compared to regular kiting and shooting. You don't have a working macro for switching between targets by chance?I can do it without but it is pretty tedious. Targeting the previous target seems so far pretty unreliable as a keybind and even as macro.
---
 Private Servers are also ripe with corruption and greed. Good look up  the whole E\*ysium scandal from a few years back. The owners of the  server selling characters/items for $$ and trying to cover it up.  Obviously not all servers are like that but the possibility is always  there where with official Blizzard servers that possibility of some guy  just dropping a few $100s and getting a 60 with thunderfury is  non-existent.
---
The "running from the Lich King" boss in Halls of Reflection was probably the biggest DPS check outside of a raid that the game has ever had.
---
I was a Warlock. Thinking about Priest because I always loved their 1v1 shadow priest damage and ability to be a key healer.
---
They will, but it won't matter for shit.
---
Parsing in Classic is IRRELEVANT. As irrelevant as a gear addon. Or LFG.
---
Who the fuck cares about parsing?
---
Can't change your mind when you're right lol.
---
I mean, I don't like most streamers at all. But even without trying, they are providing more beta testing and information than 99% of players who were ever involved in beta. 
---
I know I myself am included. Most of what I did in beta tests was create premades to test out classes, and did a ton of dueling as it was the easiest way to really get a feel for every single ability.
---
60 destroy under geared 60s too. Twink play against other twinks and players that are passing by.
---
That's just a shitty UI.  That has nothing to do with how simple or complicated vanilla was.
---
The fact that people think these actually look good is crazy.
---
The Death whispers as I make a 30 minute run excited to get back into more Classic content.
---
By Thrall, you are right! I can tolerate their /wave while passing by, but farming my mobs? That's awful
---
You don't play it for the difficulty, you play it for the story and the fast-paced action. It's a completely different game. I actually liked questing in Legion, but I never even came close to ever dying or running out of mana, it just doesn't happen.
---
**NA PVE Alliance** 
---
**Guild type:** Hardcore Raiding
---
**Raid Time:** Any time (will make time)
---
* Prot warrior and Holy priest duo
---
* Played Wow from launch, 
---
* Experienced in every dungeon as MT and healer respectively
---
Unless it's a semi competent hunter with 41 yard range. I really enjoyed pulling for my tanks if they let me with a rank one arcane shot.  Great way to keep the group at max range .
---
this man gets it. 
---
Combine with a OMAD plan and you are ripped with little maintenance
---
That's what I mean, void elves were a mistake but the bigger mistake was putting so much high elves everywhere where it became a valid argument to make them playable race even tho their population shouldn't have been enough to make them a playable race(that didn't stop them form adding void elves tho)
---
Not sure if asshole or sarcastic
---
Still a better love story than twilight.
---
I'm not giving an explanation. Just calling out for Wed-Friday.
---
Weak b8 m8
---
Yea they are only partly responsible at best. There is plenty of people who didn't play private that made it happen
---
Elemental gives better damage without the rng:)
---
BoP gear certainly can, while it is not difficult in older raids where you're one shot slapping everything, drop rates are no different, thus it takes time.
---
true, watching warrior gameplay in AV has just been continuesly get 20 dots on you and die rince repeat.
---
Dont forget it only effects the group you are in not the entire raid. That'll be an interesting change for people not used to it.
---
If you could import joanas leveling guides for each class that would be nice
---
Agreed, based on multiple max level toons of both factions. Horde can win av, but it requires more coordination than usually happens in a pug BG.
---
Nothing is official however they said that they would consider it if the community wants it. If they are ever going to do it, I imagine they would make it a separate server/realm and then give players the option to copy their Classic characters to that servers. That way players can continue playing their chars in new content while be able to keep playing that same char in Classic. Hope that makes sense. Just guesswork btw.
---
Okay
---
I got early access luckily.
---
I also have a misdirection focus macro on my cobra shot and I focus tank at the start of the instance so every time it comes off CD the tank gets my aggro.
---
What I'm looking forward to most is reputations mattering again. Also the lack of personal loot. Fuck everything that took any sense of community out of the game.
---
Speaking of warriors....Rune of the Guard Captain trinket (+1% hit and +20 AP) available from Revantusk Village quest "Job Opening blah blah blah" You have to kill about 30 elites in Jin'th'Alor but it is soooooo good for melee DPS. There will be groups of people doing the quest area during classic.
---
It's incredible that no matter how obvious, over the top and on the nose sarcasm is, people on reddit can't spot it without an /s.
---
[You Tank It](https://youtu.be/A7873rVbako)
---
This is very on point.
---
That is just some idiot who has no idea how to setup a UI.
---
Legion and BFA had very little server downtime. Blizz should be able to handle classic, especially with layering.
---
Really? You had to go there? Really?
---
tbh I would prefer it be restricted to zones rather than levels, but if 49 devilsaur farmin groups is what happens, then I guess I'll take it.
---
That's the best part about being a healer choosing who lives or dies.
---
Conversely, on not-classic WoW, certain DPS specs have a ramp up time for damage, and healers don't need to spend near as much time recovering mana, and you get some tanks that are just needlessly slow and wait like 10 seconds between pulls to, I dunno, take in the sights, and if the tank takes too long to pull then the DPS you spent the prior pull ramping up expires.  So maybe halfway through the dungeon you force a pull or two to get the tank to stop being so damn high and dumb and be like, look how much faster everything dies when we keep moving.
---
Doubtful.
---
Expansions will probably be different servers.
---
They feel they are behind? Once you get behind in classic there is no coming back but okay. Idk my guild is fine. My friends are fine. Im probably gonna play classic too if my mates will, but probably just mess around.
---
That's how long it takes for that many players to get disconnected so the can join the queue again.
---
Kinda sounds like you’ve made up your mind regardless of the truth
---
For you it might not be fear, but for most it is.
---
Yea Arthas was an awesome culmination of the story. And they did the story telling really well! While leveling was not nearly as challenging as it was in classic, at least in terms of story telling it was damn good (for the time anyways), with Arthas showing up again and again and really interweaving all the cool stuff from the story to craft a cool (albeit streamlined) experience
---
I’m no expert but I’ve heard a lot about 31/0/19 shaman spec being good enough to heal in raids while being fine for elemental pvp, might want to look into it
---
Honestly, that's a really good analogy. I just started playing classic the other day. I'm level 10 and my very first green item just dropped from a mob. It's a sword. I can't use swords yet, so I gotta do my own "quest" to go train swords. It feels epic, even though it is "just a green".
---
Will they be there at launch though? Those ghosts were added soley for soul shard farming if I recall correctly.
---
I just take sadistic pleasure in stomping helpless noobs
---
Yes but at 60 people gear up and get better. Majority of people at 19 don’t stay there and just try to have some PvP fun and get utterly destroyed.
---
Same here. Dalaran background music is probably my all time favorite.
---
Fall out boy, panic at the disco, senses fail, taking back sunday, AFI, Saosin, Underoath, Hawthorne Heights, My Chemical Romance, Silverstein
---
the list goes on and on.  the days when you'd put one cd on and listen to it 100x
---
Compared to other MMOs at the time, not really. Most classes *have* some support utility that they bring with them, but Blizzard never really made support-centric classes or specs like EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot had.
---
WoW really simplified a lot of aspects of the game, which can make it difficult to find an analogous class when coming from a game like EQ. There's no pulling mechanics, so you lose a support role shared by Monks, Bards, Shadow Knights, and Necromancers. There's not really much CC, so you lose a support role shared by Enchanters and Bards. There's no classes built completely around buffs and debuffs, so you lose a support role shared by Shamans, Enchanters and Bards. Etc, etc.
---
Except the hour it takes to get the replacement in, etc.  All to teach a hard lesson to the tank where the lesson is not to teach hard lessons.
---
I was thinking of rolling Shaman too! Thank you.
---
&gt;... started to be more fun to play *imo*
---
I don't think thats even an opinion, rather a fact.
---
Most of them but not all.
---
Gogogo tank is too slow ez pulls anyways I have a raid in 10 minutes
---
Yes, Blizzard is going punish the loyal customers who pay for things on their store, and then reward people who haven't subbed since TBC or Wrath, but had no qualms about playing an illegal pirated version of their product on illegal servers. 
---
I don't play retail, but you the fucking tourist here.
---
DPS get out of the damn whirlwind!
---
I r8 it 8/8
---
They weren't the catalyst though. They just benefited from their time in history. The actual catalysts were twofold. First Retail becoming so bad people could not lie to themselves anymore and, streamers. Them playing it on twitch is a large part of the reason why Nost got so big.
---
Unless you're my vanilla guild and you get paladin drops every week on Horde
---
Oh yeah, good call.  I guess it's been like 20 years since I did gnomer.
---
Millions!
---
I just don't believe those numbers unless we can actually see it. Like steam or even OSRS has current player numbers.
---
Yeah. He always seemed to path into me while fighting something else.
---
That’s from TBC.
---
OTOH, we have mind control and it was significantly stronger back in vanilla before the CC changes later on.  Running people into the lava was one of my favorite things to do in BRM.
---
atleast the druid tank wont have threat issues
---
Hey man, I played during Classic. Why are you defending these vermin?
---
When leveling, probably everywhere.  
---
When 60?  EPL , Badlands(for the mithril monopoly), then ruling BRM once enough people are 60.
---
Don't worry about it,   People have "ideas" about what classic was like, and there are a ton of people rolling classes that "on paper" are the best post Naxx, but then the reality hits, they are going to be rerolling.
---
Being ahead of the pack just means no dugeons, no groups, just pure leveling, just to be special for a few minutes.   Everyone after the leader just has a much easier time.
---
Anyone with a brain knows Classic is far from perfect. But it's also far better than retail. 
---
My biggest concern is that people are going to play it like it's retail when it's not. In classic, being "support" role (outside of heal/tankldps) was very much a thing.
---
Or i feign death lol
---
Roll rp/rp-pvp server and you will make some decent money off of shirts and other rp gear.
---
seems like forever tbh
---
Thorns gear ftw.
---
I'm being dead serious.
---
That's stupid.  Real life, especially now that most of the original WoW player base is comprised of people who are most likely parents ar this point, sometimes gets in the way.  Showing up 30 minutes late because your daughter's soccer game took a little longer than expected to wrap up and punishing players with 50% DKP is a surefire way to ensure you slowly lose the players in your guild.
---
The faster were falling, the servers are stopping and stalling
---
Were going to classic again
---
Just as expansions were looking up
---
BFA just wasn't good enough
---
But still they're trying one more time
---
(I feel bad about absolutely loving this perspective).
---
I pulled my atlas and dungeon companion out a couple weeks back to get ready to tank
---
Nelf of course.
---
I just found out there is no misdirect. That huntard title could become a reality.
---
That's good information.  Thank you for taking the time to write that up.
---
excellent of a friend of the insane nelf blademasters to approve a masterful artwork such as this
---
I got invited to the first 2, but now my sub has expired.  Will that  be a problem?
---
Shockwave was introduced in wotlk. In tbc you'd just aoe tank with sweeping / ww / cleave.
---
First thing that caught my eye in the photo
---
Shadowmeld is just so much better for PvP purposes. Get a cat pet, and then hide in a bush with Shadowmeld, and have the cat gank lowbies for you in STV without ever actually doing anything.
---
Also great for camping flags in WSG and AB. It also prevents enemy Rogues or Warriors from directly engaging you with the first hit, which can be utterly fundamental in winning a lot of such engagements (much more than the conditional debuff removal from Stoneskin).
---
mocking you for opting out of the one part of the game that isn't a cakewalk isn't "complaining"
---
Rune of portals costs 20s and it takes nothing for you to do it. 
---
I'd pay maybe 50s or else I'd rather just walk. Gold is valuable in classic
---
I get a persistent error saying it something went wrong loading my characters.  Won't let me add new ones either.
---
1. This is the 400th thread with the same concept title.
---
2. They weren't even the primary parties involved in getting Classic through the doors.
---
Just because they had a big name doesn't mean they deserve all the credit.
---
Exactly, TBC was the best WoW for me
---
Which is nothing.
---
yeah just spam frostbolt faster!!!
---
You can invis pot in combat, and the item you're thinking of is Goblin Rocket Helmet.
---
Face rolling nubs comes with the twink territory, but as time progressed many twink guilds did battle in the Gulch. In the early days of 19's and battle groups, many a 5 man would go head to head. Often times it would be a full 10 v 10, those were the preferred matches. 
---
Twinks were part of vanilla so #nochanges, it will be the case in Classic again, to what extent I'm not sure. Personally just going to focus on 60 content. Sure you'll have the immature player that likes to beat up on under geared players, but anyone who took twinking serious in those days knew better. Blacklisting was a thing in the twinking community, gy farming noobs and holding the flag were frowned on.
---
Warrior I love being to tank dungeons, but the gear you need so much gear, so many sets.
---
At this point I feel like Troll is the way to go.
---
Idk man, gaming to me is about gameplay. If I want a cool story, I can watch a movie. (which is not to say I don't enjoy a good story in a good game, but gameplay comes first). I'm not a fan of walking simulators and the likes. I get that some people are and I'm not bashing them, but to me when I game I need to be engaged by the gameplay.
---
God bless FROM for Dark Souls. They really showed the world that challenging gameplay still has an audience.
---
Also bless Nintendo, who still know that gameplay comes first. For 30 years now we are rescuing a fucking princess (story = awful) but fuck me if the gameplay isn't fun as hell. And even freaking Mario, a hero who's design shouts "made to appeal to children", dies. Lots of times. If you don't learn the games mechanics you don't win. There's no easy mode. Learn the game or go play another one.
---
Why play interactive stories? So you don't fall asleep because you need to press X every 20 seconds to keep the story going? At this point, why not just watch a letsplay?
---
Not shaming, genuinely curious.
---
I love this!!! Thanks so much :D
---
Night Elf's are so much better, you getting to start the fight. Really matters.
---
Blacksmithing is my favorite profession since Vanilla. Never dropped it. What I can tell you is that BOTH Armorsmith and Weaponsmith are profitable. I think equally profitable.
---
The difference is that Armorsmithing brings less profit per armor, but you sell more armors than weapons, while Weaponsmithing bring big profits, but you will sell less weapons than armors.
---
Armorsmithing require less time and resources. A LOT of Blacksmiths will choose Armorsmithing. I always chose Weaponsmith (with Axesmith), but that is not because it's more profitable (as I explained) but because I just love axes, and for a hardcore guild, Nightfall is a better plus compared to a fire resist armor. Nighfall will be ALWAYS used in raids...while fire resist armors (or any resist armor) won't. It brings me more relevance in the guild.
---
Now, keep in mind that you will have to be an engineer also, if you want to be a good tank. Which means that you will have 2 crafting professions, which means either A LOT OF FARMING at the beginning to sustain both, or have a Miner alt. Both are equally time consuming.
---
Cookie cutter spec expect you do need camouflage.
---
There is no level squish coming out before classic launches. They would wait for an expansion prepatch for that.
---
Stoneform allows you to shit on rogues,  Blind is a poison.   If Aimed Shot + Shadowmeld still worked,  i'd go Nelf,  but Stoneform is a god tier racial.
---
Because, as someone else in the chain said, ilvl scales faster than mobs. There's a breakpoint where world mobs are nothing at max level.
---
If there's not a significant gaps in raid ilvl you might get people being able to functionally overgear a new tier, which would be a disaster.
---
TAUNTS CAN MISS?!! 
---
TIL I'm a shit dps
---
We most likely won't hear anything about what Blizz plans to do next until next year's (2020) Blizzcon. Which means we won't see BC or Classic+ until sometime in 2021. 
---
They have already said they are open to the idea of releasing BC and Wrath depending on how well Classic does.
---
Indeed. I played a Tank Druid in Classic and I think I filled every role at some point or other. My DKP was so far in the negative that I stop caring about it.
---
How was your experience as a priest? Casual player that will want to both raid when I can and pvp.
---
I won't lie, the biggest reason I like playing a healer is that I have the power of life and death over the party.
---
Same reason I like playing a tank
---
Thanks fam
---
I would remove it if possible, but if the goal is to keep them in so people can still enjoy those particular mounts in game. I'd like flying mounts to be more of a utility rather than something that is passively active. I want people to only use them in specific circumstances. It'd be nice to add some type of functionality where you could practice and become a good flyer. I don't know how to do that though, so here's some unfun restrictions I thought up real quick.
---
* Maybe add restrictions to flying, where you can only fly for 10 seconds (give or take) at a time before having to land and recuperate. I'd like players to be unable to afk in the sky for infinite amounts of time.
---
* Perhaps make flying mounts much much slower speed than even a regular level 40 ground mount. Maybe that would encourage people to use ground unless they have to get on a flyer to reach a certain area. But I don't like the idea of getting to a quest objective by flying to it. If there is a fortress and you have to get to the very back of it to kill the quest objective... you should have to fight your way through to it (or stealth). So I'd like to see flying disabled for much of the maps or add anti flying cannons to more areas.
---
* What if... while using a flying mount on the ground it can go as fast as other land mounts... but if you want to take off and fly you have to channel something uninterrupted before being able to fly... maybe the same amount of time as a hearthstone or something. So if you are in a PVP area and are on the ground... you can't just fly up and leave before the other player gets to you. If you jump off a cliff on a flyer, it would glide down to the ground like a slowfall but you cannot gain acceleration unless you charged it up.
---
* I'd like to play around with the idea that any amount of damage to you while flying will knock you off the mount. 
---
* Perhaps only allow flying in strict areas. Like a sort of reverse fatigue timer which says you can now fly in this area for so many seconds.
---
* What if flying mounts act like ground mounts and if you want to fly, you charge up the fly action for a couple seconds then you get 15 seconds of slow flying before it comes down and lands, but when it lands it dismounts you and the mount just flies off and puts it on a 3 minute cooldown. 
---
* Add a few more flight paths to reach certain areas which require a flying mount.
---
* GTA comes to mind... you know how some people are really good at ramping cars and getting into strange areas? Actually I did this in TBC with Slow Fall + Rocket boots it was amazing. What if flying was more random like that... you have to gain up speed to fly then it launches you up for a very short time while having limited control over where you are gonna land based on the trajectory of where you took off. I would like to see people launching themselves into flying but then... due to lack of finesse... they land in a not so appropriate area... in the middle of a bunch of mobs etc. 
---
My end goal would be to promote ground travel, while leaving in some aspects of the flying with heavy restrictions. All these ideas are just made up really quick so I'm sure they are flawed. This is just for fun anyways.
---
No. Phase 5.
---
oh damn that was me.  This was Dec 2004 and I was a noob and I'm sorry.  I learned my lesson fast though.
---
&gt;got nothing in return 
---
China money is very lucrative
---
Frost was never more broken than in tbc.  
---
Fire, on the other hand, wasn't good again until legion.
---
Dalaran was fantastic, could listen to that one all day
---
What an undead rogue.
---
Yeah, Nost streams were really niche at the time. He's confused.
---
Two Priests for sure. If you only have one and that player dies, there's nobody to Rez them. With two Priests, one can Rez the other.
---
Axelrose.
---
A well played druid could tank most (but not all) bosses in Classic.
---
As long as there are no Draenei or Pandas it's fine with me!
---
That's what raiding is though. It's a gear treadmill, has been since day 1.
---
Also you need to be a certain level
---
You aren't helping yourself here.
---
The legendaries yes, but personal loot on all items in mythic raids is a cancerous tumor to this game.
---
MoP had self healing on every class. That was so apparently homogenized. 3 classes with Bloodlust. All player buffs being available to several different classes. Everyone gets at least 1 form of hard CC, there is no longer "utility classes" as everyone needs to do the same damage as people value damage meters higher than utility...
---
All of this and more is homogenization and it started much earlier than WoD.
---
I don't think Vael would be a problem.
---
There are a number of suboptimal builds that can keep up with top dps . . . for 1-2 minutes, and then they're oom. Sustainability is the reason those builds aren't good in raids. You have infinite mana for Vael, so shadow priests, arcane missile mages, and oomkins should all do well in that fight. PI priest is a solid build for Vael. Druid tanks are great for Vael.
---
I seem to remember a much longer cost decay from retail vanilla.  Definitely not a week, maybe 3-4 times that.
---
NA Alliance PVE looking for US Evening (8pm) West Coast mediumcore raiding guild (clear current content while current.) PVE server and ~8pm raid time are a necessity.
---
Played paladin since Vanilla, coming back (never left?)
---
Big time theorycrafter. Tryhard. The kind of player who comes with full consumables to carry the slackers, and happy to do so.
---
Experience with class + role leading / raid leading / guild officership.
---
Been holy since OG Molten Core through every raid since. But I've been discussing with a lot of theorycrafters for Spelladin DPS (it looks incredibly fun and top tier DPS). I'd love to give it a try in raids, but will be prepping for Pre-BIS Holy within 3 weeks of launch as a backup.
---
In most cases you're right, however there are people who are good at pvp who roll a twink for some diversity.
---
They were in 1.12.
---
Which is what we get in Classic.
---
I feel like optimizing your raid matters most the first few times through where people are generally under geared and some of the encounters that are sort of "DPS checks" can become kind of risky. After you have a couple geared tanks, healers that don't go oom too easily, and a solid DPS core, you can honestly afford to bring pretty much *anything* so long as they know the encounter and are just giving it their best.
---
...that's yellow.
---
I dont disagree with you tbh
---
Orc*
---
The problem is that most guilds nowadays use loot council. Loot council usually takes into account attendance and performance. If the 5 other Mage's are world buffed and you arent, you will never out DPS them. Which puts you at the bottom of the priority. That's where the problem occurs, because of the competition it forces among your class/spec if some have it and some don't.
---
I dont see the difference aside from the class dynamics being at each bracket. BGs with a mix of twinks and non twinks or BGs with geared and non geared, non leveled proffesions.
---
I don't even Twink.
---
As a hunter you know I'm gonna want this come BWL
---
Not as bad as mage.. as mage i always had to show up to the raid an hour early just to fill my bags with food and water to pass out.
---
It’s borderline shambolic... i cant think of a single good reason for it.
---
The Allied races are a reward for a very long rep grind, just like Vanilla.
---
It just has a storyline scenario, that's fundamentally just fluff, to explain the lore behind your actions.
---
70 days too many. With all the games I play/have played I've never looked forward to a release more than I'm looking forward to Classic.
---
You sound angry
---
No way in hell streamers had to do with it. Nostalrius had over 10k people at launch (this is factual). On a matter of months, the server grew so big they had to open a PvE realm, which, at first, hosted around 4k players while the main PvP realm hosted 8k or 9k players at peak hour. Streamers had nothing to do with this whatsoever.
---
Stitches hits wayyy harder and is tankier tho
---
What? Care to explain what this means?
---
anyone want to guess what the * stands for? My guess is y
---
Thanks my dude!
---
Weak, transparent bait. An overall 3/10.
---
More coordination or stealthers who do their job well. Gotta get into the camp and take the archers in the towers out. Helps a lot with the chokepoint.
---
I didn't play true vanilla but in the one I did play I haven't had much issue with this. Mostly I'd just warn the group that two of them will have to footy it or I can't summon.
---
I will murder someone for there position ahead of me in queue
---
Same for me making mage biscuits. I have no problem throwing up the table for the party, even if no one wants it. Not like it takes a lot of mana.
---
I'd rather play with a retail shlub than whatever type of person this is
---
At least the quiver provides a stat boost. Other class bags just take up a slot.
---
Wow. Please ban this person from existing in Blizzard associated anything, at all.
---
The difference is that in Classic, if someone wore gear that *looked* epic, you instantly recognized that they were a hardcore player. Just by a quick glance. 
---
It doesn't matter what specific set it is. Every single player in the game looks epic - so no one does.
---
Windows M O V I E M A K E R 
---
I love it
---
I missed Legion but I remember BFA had like a 6 hour downtime the first or second day.
---
Nyhm :')
---
DPS are a dime a dozen. Stop kidding yourself.
---
Don't be a shitty DPS. We aren't talking about the occasional bad/accidental pull. We're talking about the DPS who continually and regularly puts the welfare of the group at risk. Fuck them.
---
A, e, i, o... all I got.
---
I member back in vanilla on my warlock my other party members would end up in a sort of stand off about who was going to come to the instance with me to help summon. Sometimes someone would cave and head over, other times people would drop group cause they didn't want to do it.
---
I've also been added to a group, summoned people to the dungeon then booted for someone else standing nearby.
---
It really depends on the group, like someone else said in this thread: if everyone heads over and you summon the stragglers things should be fine. But if you have people demanding you summon them, you're probably gonna have a bad time.
---
This is easy for me, I don't like how limited I feel in selecting a viable pet. For example, I'd love to use a bear, but they have no unique family ability, and no sprint ability.
---
Good boy
---
Rank 10
---
Fury tanking in Classic will be as good as Shaman tanking.
---
Fury tanks will drop like flies in Classic, with 14% bosses parry.
---
People just don't get it yet, and private server players are delusional, keep saying that 14% parry vs 5.6% parry "is not a big deal".
---
Yeah, will see about that:)
---
&gt; Mounts at 20. 
---
Try 40% move speed mounts from level 1 (if you have heirloom gear).
---
Funny based on your username lol
---
Private servers aren't illegal, emulation is legal in at least the USA.
---
Same. Goblins have been with the horde since at least Warcraft 2 so that's no problem for me. I'm having problems thinking of an alliance race to add though
---
In hopes of buying more developers.
---
For sure do it if it's only for a couple months. Raiding in the middle of the night is too brutal for most people, even nolifers like myself, but if it's just during phase 1, you won't get too far behind. In fact it might help that your prime time is during the early hours in North America, there'll be less competition for mobs and quest objects while you level, and whatever you'll choose to farm to make $$$ at 60 until you move back :p
---
Your helm for Feral DPS is off, BiS is the Wolfshead helm
---
Just make sure to level cooking for all that Thistle Tea you'll need to make.
---
I mean, none of this is necessary for half of the endgame content, so no need to speak of it as fact.
---
It is funny how you say "I" in there so much but are near commanding it be the rule for all players. 
---
Even signing a name there, like wtf is that even?
---
Joana is already having one made for release :)
---
It's so sad. I would have liked a sea zone in every xpac since.
---
What changed varies person to person on who you ask.
---
Myself personally the reason I can't play retail anymore is that their simply isn't a class I enjoy playing anymore, to many changes loss of class identity have removed the last bits of appreciation I have for Retail.
---
The last time I really enjoyed any class in WoW was during WoD when I played Ret for Raiding and had 4 other max level character for various reasons.
---
In legion I found Ret to be so changed from the playstyle that I loved in WoD that not even Ashbringer could bring me to play the class/spec any further.
---
I did find a role I enjoyed in Legion which was Blood DK and actually got the Cutting Edge Argus kill.
---
Though the same thing happened to Blood DK that happened to Ret paladin in the expansion transition, they ruined the class in how it appealed to me and I quit at the start of BfA.
---
I tried a few classes and specs after awhile and settled on Arm's warrior for awhile, never really enjoying the class as I felt easily replacable by any other DPS but it was the only spec that I felt any form of attachment to.  Once Uldir was over I quit after seeing less geared people of every other class and spec being able to laughably out DPS me.
---
Not sure if a troll post or if this person is serious.
---
Given the 2 different design philosophies Classic and Retail cater to two different groups of players. I personally believe a large number of Retail players won't even make it to 40 before deciding Classic is too "hard" before going back to retail and not looking back.
---
funny I think the same about warrior and rogue (two classes I'm choosing from)    
---
play what you enjoy dude, don't choose class because others
---
I mained a holy priest for a decade. With all the hubbub about Classic on the way, I'm anxious to get back in and roll another one. Life &amp; death in your hands. Guaranteed loot if it's an upgrade (in guild runs.) There's nothing better.
---
I'd say that we've been merely collecting wood for a decade and Nostalrius was a single match. Not quite enough *yet*, but a decent beginning.
---
Thats is of course the case but not what we are talking about here. Although that is technically mob tagging, thats not what people mean when they talk about mob tagging to level up in dungeons. Athene even got banned for doing it (not in classic tho)
---
The amount of absolutely pointless youtube WoW content I have been watching, about stuff I already know 100%, baffles me...but I keep doing it.  Hurry up Classic!
---
Yup - They've basically said to participate you need to have an active sub.
---
Yeah this is just a bad PUG in Vanilla.
---
They're going to have a tank throw a bitch fit and Hearth out of RFK/BFD. Then you're left with the choice of abandoning the last 30 minutes worth of time, or having someone leave and pray they can find any tank.
---
You don’t stack as in don’t take more than one in raid?
---
Nobody thinks they are exploits. 
---
Many people think they are cumbersome, but if someone legitimately thinks they are an exploit, they should be ignored.
---
thank you for thoroughly testing the beta
---
What a nerd
---
[mrw](https://www.livememe.com/spvfjmp)
---
Warlock can do it solo as well
---
Looks like a great addon, can't wait to try it in action.
---
The same could be said about any mmo, who cares about parsing in retail or ffxiv. Its a way to check and improve your play relative to others
---
Twinking was fun to me because there was a final set of gear that you could work for and make your character perfect and then enjoy PvPing with that. At 60 there's an almost neverending striving to make your character better.
---
Hey everyone.  I'm guild leader for a guild I'm putting together for classic.  
---
You might recognize my name from other posts I've done on this subreddit highlighting some in-depth information about WoW Vanilla.  [Post on Blackwing Lair](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs6mxw/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_warn_you/)| [Post on Honor System](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0m1gb/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_talk_to_you/) .  If you see what type of effort I did for those posts, just **imagine what I'd do for you as your guild leader**. Food for thought.
---
* Currently we have a core group of 20-25 people ready for Classic.  I'm wanting 60 people by end of September so I'm stepping up recruitment now.
---
* Most of us are around the age of 30.  All of us have jobs, some have kids.  **We might be an ideal fit for people who want a guild that is aiming to eventually progress but isn't expecting you to make WoW a full time job.**  Also, if you're younger you're still welcome to join of course.
---
* We haven't decided yet on a name yet because we are more focused on getting the right people first.  Stability &gt; Progression.
---
* We will have a heavy PvP focus until we get the numbers for PvE.  We will most definitely not be a 'World First' or 'Server First' type of guild, but we will definitely be a solid core.
---
* I personally love world PvP and will lead tons of World PvP expeditions, so if you're wanting to do a lot of ganking and city raiding, consider us your home.
---
* We have numerous previous rank 14's and lots of seasoned PvP veterans.  PvP will be core focus for many members.
---
* We have numerous previous PvE raid leaders for Vanilla content.
---
* Most of us live in Central or Eastern US, but we don't really care where you live.
---
* **Experience is not needed**.  Would actually much rather have an easy-going person who is easy to talk to instead of a pretentious know it all.
---
* **I'm more concerned about culture fit than skill fit.**  People can always learn/improve -- it's more important to have the right personalities.  Come hang out in our discord to see if you like us.
---
* **No class or role restrictions**.  We have a google doc that has a class breakdown of everyone who is planning to play, so you're welcome to take a look and go from there.
---
* I've mentioned 'culture' a lot so let me best describe what I think our culture is:  regular dudes who like to play video games.  We have bankers, statisticians, real-estate developers, academics, mechanics, food/alcohol distributors, nurses, etc.  Come from all walks of life.  Sometimes we aren't the most PC but we don't actively encourage it.  **A sense of humor is required for sure, but you aren't expected to be chatty if you just wanna be chill**.  You're completely welcome to join and just be a fly on the wall for all we care.
---
Message me here or just join our Discord if you want to check us out:  [https://discord.gg/Kcb3SqF](https://discord.gg/Kcb3SqF)
---
The mmo equivalent of having 17 taskbar add-ons on your browser.
---
It is ready to play now.  Why would they delay the release?
---
You do *adequately* against Vael. Sustainability isn't the only issue with hybrid dps specs, and mind you, I'm saying that as a Spriest main. A few hybrids here and there wouldn't make or break the Vael encounter, but an entire *raid* of them and/or very suboptimal pure dps specs is going to cause serious problems. Actual "proper setup" guilds broke up on Vael in vanilla, with all the MC gear they could muster. A raid of people without functioning tier sets, piecemeal epic loot, extreme overlap on loot priority, and specs that already only do adequate damage at best even without sustainability concerns is going to have a damn hard time overcoming that speed bump. Maybe by Phase 5, after they can get extra gear from ZG and AQ20, it could be feasible, but I certainly would be surprised.
---
You're the kind of guy who thinks hardcore guilds are going to have 15 fury warriors, aren't you ?
---
There's no vote to kick in classic lol
---
2 for some classes honestly.
---
OP didn't even look at the context of what they posted. They merely have an unpopular opinion and a need for karma.
---
The only thing I have learned from this like most topics are that people are bored.
---
What are you even saying? 
---
Are you saying that pserver players are worse than whom? Who else do you know that's playing vanilla wow? None.
---
More than 3 max, preferably 2.
---
Stress test this Wed-Thurs though right?
---
&gt; the skill level is most of the time lower on private servers than on official servers
---
I don't accept this premise at all.
---
He doesn't want to put in for time off on the 27th at the risk of Blizzard moving the launch to September.
---
If we are sitting in the world of reality, blizzard making new content period is Absurd.
---
Blizzard will continue to restart classic servers, they will probably make a BC server as well.
---
There is guaranteed sub money in making classic, bc and wrath servers. sure some element of their customers will be split across their games, but they will still be subbed. 
---
Rereleasing by and wrath is less work than remaking classic.
---
Making new content for classic, when’re there is already progressive content in existence is nonsensically expensive. 
---
But since we can agree t may not be the best business move...what’s the harm in theorizing how we, individual players, would make additions to classic wow...in the vein of classic wow that wasn’t just BC....
---
Absurd. Ridiculous.
---
I like this one too... but I honestly do not remember how good or meh Hemo was. 
---

---
I'm not saying the server was unpopular before steamers. It was very popular. However streamers taking it to being the number one thing viewed on twitch. Is what made it explode and blizzard pay attention. Twitch is huge in the modern gaming market.
---
What? You want ME to use MY classes abilities? HOW DARE YOU!
---
Night elf all the way.
---
Stoneform is nice against rogues,  Shadowmeld is nice against anyone, and good hunters destroy rogues anyway.
---
Got in a bad spot and got jumped and now your being camped.  rezz + eat + drink + meld. now the gankee becomes the ganker. (bring lots of simple wood, cause your going to need to start a ton of campfires on top of of wanna be griefers.).
---
Dem pants are from Gnomahome bro
---
Have you played the beta?  My 4 years on pservers were almost mentally erased when I saw how smooth it was the first time in game.  I am excited for everyone to get in and run around to feel the difference.  It is mind blowing
---
Eh. If you can farm 20 gold/hr, it’s worth it to pay a gold, because the port usually saves more than 3 minutes.
---
Lmao what?
---
Ohh I get it now ty
---
People who put in basic effort like showing up on get rewarded for it. People who, don't.  That's how incentives work.
---
Really niche? They hit number one most viewed on twitch.
---
Not only that, they haven’t delayed a WoW launch since BC and iirc haven’t delayed a set launch date since the activision merger.
---
The old days of blizzard not meeting release dates is far gone at this point. Now if they set a date they meet that date.
---
Dark Silk Shirt to go with my Judgement Armor!
---
Just make azure hoods ez money
---
*again* treeform aura.
---
Illegitimate.
---
They should know better by tbc though lol
---
Your comparing endgame with a character with power coming from the end of an expansion before downscaling hits when your 111 to literal noob leveling.
---
No opinion on the addon itself but that name is either incredibly dumb and non-descriptive or it's going clean right over my head.
---
&gt;If there's not a significant gaps in raid ilvl you might get people being able to functionally overgear a new tier, which would be a disaster.
---
Please explain.
---
In classic the ilvl range from dinging maxlevel to top end Naxx gear spanned about 50 itemlevels. For the entire 'expansion'. Didn't cause any troubles.
---
Nowadays you get more itemlevels from doing heroic dungeons after dinging. Why is that EVER necessary? I played BfA for about a month and my char is ~ilvl340, where leveling gear gave like... 200? I didn't even raid. And it's gotten worse now since the ilvl of the rewards has been increased at some point. Your power EXPLODES for no reason at all. Meanwhile I absolutely disagree that you don't feel your char getting stronger with smaller upgrades. I cherished every upgrade I got in Vannilla and there was a clear difference between someone who just dinged and someone who farmed BWL, yet no to the absurd point where you might as well not play.
---
This is good general advice for beginners but makes less sense the better you get at the game. 
---
For instance a mage and rogue can easily handle a 4 humanoid elite pull without taking any damage, so there's no need to slow down.
---
Warrior. I've always played and loved warriors, but being kited for days is gonna suck!
---
Probably Night Elf. That Shadowmeld is super nice for consistently getting the jump on people and hiding from other hunters/everyone.
---
I never minded it that much. You need 2 others to summon anyway, so most of the time everyone just flies to the instance, maybe you have to summon 1 or 2. I see it as a bonus, less waiting.
---
For raids, you'll probably summon a few slackers each time for the sake of getting things started, but it should never be a significant portion of the raid. Guild members should be expected to be at the raid entrance at raid time.
---
I think the newest concecretion animation is way cooler than the old one
---
Mages are far from the easiest to level. They’re easy to level, but, I can guarantee a pet class levels significantly easier, and faster, than a mage.
---
Sure, but levelling still isn't a challenge, it's just punishing. 
---
That being said, let's compare bfa raids to vanilla in that respect...
---
I love the fact that you keep insisting that your view of what people should enjoy is the only correct view
---
There is a growing number of smoothbrains on this sub that will call using raid buffs an exploit
---
Lord of the Rings baby
---
Form a militia. Other world pvp games often do.
---
yeah removed in 8.1.
---
The Hobbit, a classic book Pog
---
Yes, can confirm the beta works on my computer.
---
Chair looks ok
---
Its a very solid class to pick!
---
You will always find a spot in a guild or raid group since Priests are the most flexible healer and usually you bring 5 or 6 priests to a raid (if memory serves me well). They can raid heal and tank heal effectively.
---
They are also very good levelers as Shadow, probably one of the best classes to level up!
---
In PVP they can be decent healers and are AWESOME as Shadow, their dots DESTROY people, like not even kidding, they are ruthless.
---
Concerning offspecs in PVE (dungeons and raids), hybrid classes in vanilla rarely could compete with pure DPS classes (Warrior being the exception) but from all hybrids, Shadow Priests might be the best DPS specc from "healing classes", they do decent damage.
---
You can't go wrong with Priest really, the only reason I am not playing one is purely because I have done almost all content in Vanilla with it and I want to play something else.
---
IMO if you don't want to "take chances" on picking a class (like always find a spot, not feeling underpowered, put up good numbers, etc) there are 4 classes that stand out: Mage, Warrior, Rogue and Priest.
---
No effect, but I'd like them to turn down the sound when doing a priest group buff, that shit's loud when you're wearing headphones.
---
Shots fired.
---
I love how the desktop background on one of your monitors looks like a picture of your deck, but from a different angle.
---
Ingenious!!
---
Mvp!
---
The realisation is that nobody will take an elemental shaman in a pug unless you're with friends or a guild.
---
This has to be a troll. P server communities are like 100% more autistic minmax zones than retail wow where 95% of the playerbase just does lfr and pet battles
---
I just can't be arsed running back and forth through DM north twice a week anymore.
---
I don't think so. It's account wide though.
---
The attunements are nothing compared to the tedium of the old ones though.
---
Nah you'll absolutely need engineering even as a druid. You might be in cat for stealth or bear to charge/stun/eat damage, but 60% of your time will be spent in caster form if not more. You need to be in caster form for hots, roots, faerie fire/moonfire and that's going to be what you are doing most of the time. Engineering is also just too valuable to pass up.
---
Yeah we really have had about 100 of these posts.
---
We are all thankful for Nost for what they did for the classic community but let's not say they got nothing in return.
---
Better wait one full week.
---
Still gets a lot of people. I rate it 8/8.
---
Nice work! 
---
Can u add an overview of things i can do to get upgrades for my char. So that i can see what is most effcient thing i can do to get gear.
---
for example: Run this dungeon to get these items. Run that other dungeon to get these upgrades. Do this quest to get that item.
---
IIRC, at that time raid mobs did not give you soul shards, right? 
---
You had no choice but to fill up your bags with shards, make 40 healthstones. 
---
Then fill up your shards again. Warlocks always had to start preparing for the raid an hour beforehand. 
---
I didn't play a warlock at that time so correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Nothing creeped me out more than people asking for "cookies" over vent to the female warlocks in mock errotic voices.  
---
It's a "healthstone"!  A god damn healthstone.
---
maybe. idk
---
This is amazing thank you for this tool!
---
*Most* classes go from level 80 to 120 without getting a new active ability. 40 levels of the same dull rotational gameplay. Great leveling experience...
---
I enjoy both and have played both, it just sounds like you're bad at managing your time in real life and in game.
---
I'm trying to figure out this sub's obsession with alienating people that will play both. The subs are linked so its going to happen. The constant shitting on retail just makes the Classic community seem so toxic and childish.
---
People on either faction always think the other one is better. The reality is that most players are just fucking bad.
---
I love the fact that you build the argument you want to combat.
---
Ah well, that's likely true. But hey we know what we're getting into. It's not like this is news.
---
&gt;Because we always knew no matter what that private servers are not secure and will inevitably shut down.
---
This is honestly such bullshit lmao, nostalrius is the last server to be "shut down" and that's over 3 years ago, not to mention, it essentially came back, I can still log on my old nostalrius character. 
---
The population doesn't die on these servers, the game dies because naxx out, that's only natural.
---
A lot of guessing games with PServers and instability ie might get brought down any day and lose all progress. Big chance for corruption. To much risk. This is why I never tried private servers. 
---
WoW has been on a steady decline since Wrath. I have had an active account except a few months in WoD. 
---
My hype is around getting back to when the game was good for me. My wife plays with me now. I think she will like the slower pace of Classic. A lot of my RL friends who have played with me over the years are coming back to play with us. 
---
I am more hyped for the community aspects of Classic than anything. Having unlimited time to get to Naxx and clear it sounds awesome. We don’t plan on raiding more than 2 days. So it will be a long time before we run to the edge of Classic and weep.
---
Don’t need to alt tab with this, good for immersion, I dig it.
---
Did you play the beta?
---
The truly great tuning never made it out of beta before nerfs.
---
All leveling dungeons on pservers are significantly harder than on classic
---
Then these people have a gross misunderstanding of what either raid buffs or exploits are.
---
I about to throw myself into a snow bank. In an attempt to chriogenically freeze myself until August, Cartman style.
---
In classic, the max rank food spell only gives you like 4 food items. You have to cast it over... and over... and over... and over. No buffet for everyone.
---
They haven't yet, but they will if Legion serves as an example. As for what you needed to do to attune? The quest line that you needed to do anyway. It wasn't hard or interesting. It was just another quest hub that you did while leveling.
---
This wasn't Vanilla but back in the day I ran around as a Prot Warrior Tauren with 3 stuns and I was pretty phenomenal in BGs. Especially AV.
---
I love the fact that I have popcorn.
---
Last server to get taken down is over 3 years ago, and the community on pservers are really tight, you play with the same players for several years in a row that's community right there.
---
Honestly, no.
---
Even DPS is split into two: dual wielding and 2h builds. This is why warriors even though they are the most played, don't feel like they are.
---
Weather
---
Wish shaman heals would use the water animation instead
---
And in reality, no one will EVER use the healthstones. They rather all die, blame the healer and after the whole run they wonder what is that thing in their inventory. Try and make new candy after a wipe. No one (well except that one guy that actually cares) can accept the item, BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE THE FORMER ONE IN THEIR INVENTORY:
---
Some serious projection going on here. Yikes.
---
1. Buy whatever chair you want from an office supply store and make sure to buy the ~$20 protection plan, price doesn't matter.
---
2. Wait until there's anything you don't like about the chair. Squeaking will do.
---
3. Make an online claim on the protection plan.
---
4. They will always send you a check for the full amount of the chair and never ask for the chair back.
---
5. Repeat whenever you want a new chair.
---
Substantially less DPS is a bit of a misnomer. You can still top charts as Feral DPS but only if you've min maxed to the extreme and even then you aren't guaranteed to top just depends on how everyone does on misses/crits. More likely than not you will do plenty of damage, more than most, just not top the chart (if you are using buffs/consumables).
---
Feral DPS is also really strong going into MC as they don't need a scaled up weapon for more damage (and their BiS is out of Gnomer so easy to get). After MC they become middle of the pack and even lower as time goes on, but still very viable with powershifting and mcp
---
If English is not your first language, please disregard. 
---
If English is your first language, what the fuck did you just say?
---
Really now?
---
My argument: "Not everyone enjoys pvp"
---
Your argument: "I consider PVP to not be boring, and rest of the game to be boring, therefore you are objectively wrong and im right for mocking you".
---
what thing have you have that's deleted? I still have my characters from every server i've played on the lats 4 years.
---
I love the fact that you have Skittles. 
---
Hey look I'm like that other idiot.
---
Main tanking on a prot warrior and getting used to backpedaling, to find myself with the awful habit during PvP.
---
There is not and will not be any selling of data. The main purpose for creating an account is so that you can persist your list of characters/sets and access them across different devices.
---
I think there might be value in being able to create anonymous sets as well, but it's not something I've tackled yet. Thanks for the feedback.
---
I would 100% join in and gladly do a sub optimal build for this.
---
&gt; people leaving at the first sign of a wipe
---
Yeah, they're gonna get over that real quick when they realize it takes time and effort to even get into a group. Vanilla will take those players and either chew them up and spit them out, or condition them to become the same community that we had in Vanilla. My two cents.
---
Righteous Fury

NA | Alliance | PvP server | CST
---
We are a group of people looking to build a strong community of players. We will focus primarily on Raids, but we will also do Premades, and world pvp events. We will raid weeknights tuesday and thursday time TBD. Guild will follow a DKP/EPGP system, with loot council override for special main tank and other purposed that advance the Guild.
---
Please have the following mindset
---
Willing to learn and adapt to new play styles'
---
Willing to put the Guild and Progression before yourself
---
Be respectful and cordial at all times
---
General love for the game and community
---
I am looking to do some really great things, we will find our stride in MC, Farm BWL and ZG, Just in time to reach our peak for AQ and Naxx. We will have 1 Officer for each of the classes, TBD upon release.
---
Please ask any questions you may have here, and send me a message if you are intersted!
---
Never twinked myself but i can see the fun in being a 39 enhancement shaman with pod. Seems like thats the only place where enhancement shaman can shine
---
It is a shadow bolt in the beta
---
I'm rolling salts through BGs til they get too high level then repeat.
---
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!! I NEEED MY FIX!!!!
---
It's kind of unfortunate that the game moved to the direction of damage/tank/heals because it did sort of leave certain classes in the dust and had them get pigeonholed into the "trinity" model. 
---
People like to shit on everquest, DAOC, and other older MMO's but one thing that those games did right is the support roles. Classes like bards, enchanters, and shamans in those games really did give all important buffs or have the main CC abilities, whereas the "pure" classes had very short duration CC's or had a singular role to fill.  That model was fun for a lot of people but it also was a bit restrictive in the sense that it forced certain group makeups to occur or you weren't going to down a world boss or have a chance at success in pvp. You can definitely see where the devs for Vanilla WoW came from, and Vanilla is the closest iteration of the game that we have where classes like Pally/Shaman/Druid/Warlock fill more of a supporting role than a pure heal/dps role.
---
Lmao
---
Same here. I showed up well in advance. I provided enchants and potions / flasks to those that needed them.
---
70 more days untill I get classic wow and 2 weeks vacation.
---
I used to farm the eyes for the priest quest as a lock. I could solo kill the elites right outside the zone with fear and dots / pets. 
---
But yeah as others said NOTHING in vanilla has the aoe capabilities of mages. Most classes are lucky to get 1 aoe with major drawbacks. Mages have tons with major BENEFITS.
---
&gt; window licking DPS.
---
Sod off. Windows are *fucking delicious*.
---
I didn't experience the bug during Diablo III but 2 of the 3 of my friends did.  You sure bet your ass me and my buddy that could play stayed on all night and didn't log off while the others were infuriated.
---
I'm just excited they listened to people and acknowledged that many aspects of the vanilla game are far superior when it comes to the experience of playing a real MMORPG game. In retail today you are the strongest God warrior of Azeroth, everything revolves around you, rewards are thrown at you with very little effort and everything is made to appeal to casual players (dungeon/raid finders, things taking less time over all, less grinds, etc). I like to compare it to the differences in Oblivion and Skyrim. Skyrim is awesome at first but they when you play it you realize there is much less roleplaying build into the game. You are always the dovahkiin godly warrior and the attention is always centered on you and it gets stale. In Oblivion there was so much more to it. You could completely ignore the main quest lines from the beginning and go off roleplaying as a combat bard, maxing you speechcraft, merhcatile, athletics, illusion and hand to hand. Basically Skyrim just had less numbers, less options, less random fun/cool things you could do, they got rid of a whole schools of magic in Skyrim for some reason and just lumped it into another one (Mysticism). Oblivion had so much fun/random things built into the game like when I thought "Oh I'm going to enchant my gloves with fire so I'll do fire damage when I punch people". Then when I equipped my gloves I just burst into flames are started taking fire damage until I took them off. I absolutely love how that was built into the game and really don't like how little things like this are seen less and less today in games in general.
---
Looks quite comfy.
---
Candy? I thought they were lemons
---
The popularity of this server, the outrage at the C&amp;D against them as well as their willingness to comply effectively making them martyrs created the social trend that resulted in a big petition.   
---
Slightly more than "partly responsible" in my opinion.
---
There's a dwarf house you can enter which is underground so it looks like on the map that you are defending a graveyard. Best AFK spot.
---
You're gonna love my nuts.
---
Lol a game from 7 years ago... why wouldn't you assume it's going to be similar to BFA or legion launch?
---
It will be fine - 6pm est on the 26th worked fine for me with BFA - I was able to play by 7:30, was fun watching streamers quest while I failed to connect for an hour and a half though!
---
When you get all of that from someone who is trying to help you use the word complaining correctly you should probably seek professional help for your debilitating persecution complex.
---
eu here sorry bad english
---
Is this just a trap to enter my character name so you can steal it from me and then blackmail me?
---
I get PVP gear haha, past that, i dunno I never really thought about it, I just keep playing the game
---
I played a lock way back when but had a lot of things I never did. Namely the dreadstead and the doomguard. Can't play something else until that's done.
---
It’s all good, we appreciate your efforts in learning another language.
---
You're right and I have some ideas for assigning value to some of the more unique items and proc effects, but for now they are not taken into account.
---
I do remember the friction certain horde players felt about BE but I wouldn't call them a "cute race" or really feminine nor would I call the Horde the "manly faction". I mean dwarves and humans are definitely manly, and NE are less effiminate than BE, also the Undead are really just walking bones not very manly imo
---
Your 7 day old account makes it seem like you may not be worthy either...
---
TBH i never actually read while grinding AV rep.
---
 I ran the game in windowed mode and made window as small as it possibly could go and watched movies on my single monitor.
---
I didn't think so, but i was assuming that with 2 other players one of the three would be the party leader and if one gets kicked the other two would auto-leave.
---
I'm also pretty sure that filling three dps slots is at least twice as easy as filling a tank plus healer slot.
---
Please stop with this post. It's really  just awful.
---
&gt; Sure, but levelling still isn't a challenge, it's just punishing. 
---
Well and now it's neither challenging nor punishing.
---
&gt;That being said, let's compare bfa raids to vanilla in that respect...
---
If only 15 years of experience had as positive an impact on all game systems and not just raiding.
---
That said, Vanilla raiding wasn't bad. It was different. It was way less complex, but very punishing and had some mechanics that are all but gone nowadays (threat, mana).
---
Yea, retail Mythic raids are far harder but while I appreciate classic WoW's difficulty that does not mean "harder is always better". There is a sweet spot. Mythic raids are for a tiny audience. Heroic raids are pretty spot on tbh. That said having to farm Normal, then Heroic and then Mythic to progress is awful, at least that shit didn't exist in Vanilla. You killed the end boss and that was it. From then on you just geared up for the next raid. Why Blizzard cannot make it so that you can start Mythic raids with Mythic raid gear from the previous raid tier is beyond me. They could easily squish itemlevels (AND keep content relevant) by making it so that NM ilvl from Tx is equal (or slightly superior) to LFR ilvl from Tx+1 so that people can stick with their difficulty and have little to 0 incentive to farm lower difficulties, while being able to go back and try higher difficulties for worthwhile gear (NM raider might take the NM gear into the heroic version of the last raid).
---
But somehow NM gear of Tx1 needs to be better than Heroic gear of Tx. Because fuck you.
---
Hey!
---
Playing around with it and super impressed. Definitely going to be using this. Noticed that it was missing [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18879/heavy-dark-iron-ring](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18879/heavy-dark-iron-ring) (Looking in Phase 1, haven't looked in other phases yet). Not sure if intentional or not. Thanks for making this!
---
RMP?
---
He tryharded his answer :P
---
preach brother! Lol
---
Again,  a petition among private server people,  they are a drop in the bucket compared to the people who don't play private but wanted and pushed for classic.
---
And now you're just trolling. Im dissapointed with myself that i actually tried to reason with you.
---
Go home, troll.
---
Yea same it’s kinda ridiculous at this point. I knew I wanted it but I didn’t know I’d start getting consumed again so quick
---
This is terrible satire or a worthless opinion. Either way, reported.
---
Lower player pool will have fewer "great" players.
---
&gt; Sure they don't scale into raids well
---
They were also super useful in raids, but people didn't know or care to figure that out. Kings Ret was probably the best buffing spec in the game at the time.
---
Shit. I was hoping I'd be able to distinguish the two so I can ice block a death coil as a mage :(
---
Hmm Idk I really like the idea of an obvious horde race like goblins to stay neutral
---
Honestly for something like that you're probably just going to have to do it manually. I'd suggest adding another spec under feral that uses the same stat weights but has "powershifting" in brackets and just lock the helm to Wolfshead seeing as it is BiS for the entirety of Vanilla.
---
I've read his reply 3 times where the f did he said that's what ruined wow?
---
**Casual Family friendly guild.** 
---
**Guild Name:** TBD later by guild members  
---
**Faction:** Horde
---
**Language:** English
---
**Server Location:** West Coast - RP
---
**Playstyle:** I wanted to make this guild on an RP server because I like these kinds of servers and the names people use. This guild will not be a raiding guild at first. So if you are wanting to jump right into raiding this is not for you. This guild however is for those who work full time, have family obligations, and want to experience the pre raid end game, IE dungeons and getting those pre raid BiS items. If at a later date we grow to a size that allows us to do 20 man raids, then I will plan sometime accordingly. For starters however, the end game dungeons and helping eachother out in the world will be our focus. If this sounds like something you are interested in, send me a message on discord.

I played hotw ns exclusively through AQ. 99% of my time spent was healing. Honestly my memory is too fuzzy to separate vanilla naxx and wotlk naxx, but I know my guild didnt get very far. All 3-4 of us druids were hotw ns, and basically just spammed rank4 healing touch. I'm sure you would be fine with that spec through naxx.
---
You need help.
---
you can roll a hybrid deep balance and resto spec and slap fools.
---
I agree with this sentiment. There was a reason my guild downing vael in vanilla did so and our top 3 dps (all rogues) specced seal fate prep so we had 2 vanishes. Like, I dont think having a suboptimal dps here and there is going to kill a raid, but an entire raid of them will fold in the long run when they dont have the numbers to support the content.
---
In the X-Roads raids
---
I mean I think specifically he’s referencing the players who continue to move on through Xpacs. I know there’s great players on both sides but for example, you don’t see multi world first PVE guilds staying on private servers. Or multi rank 1 gladiators and RBG champs staying on pservers. I think that’s more so what’s being referenced. I do think a pserver guild will likely have the upper hand in classic content though
---
&gt;Nobody thinks they are exploits.

Its borderline insanity to do something scheduled with friends for 3 hours a night, twice a week? I'm not even the most hardcore gamer - when I raided at my most 'hardcore' in a top-200 guild i had a 15 hour week work experience, was attending university full time in my final year and raided 3 nights a week for 3 hours a part. I played maybe 5 hours on the weekend at most. 
---
Logging on only to raid is literally what most mythic raiders do - a lot of people dont have interest in the game outside of it,  people likely play a few hours here and there in the week to prepare or to get their mythic box, but that's the reality. Most mythic raiders are just people who only enjoy raiding. 
---
It's literally just being good at the game and putting your hours into the exact content you want to play.
---
It's in classic, but not in the beta so far nobody has seen it... I think
---
&gt;That's part of Blizzard fucking up with making far too rapid ilvl progression part of the game too. In Vanilla and TBC there was nothing wrong with having sub-levelcap blue gear from dungeons while starting on the first raids. 
---
Right... but how do you negate the previous expansion top end raiding gear if you don't have a significant ilvl jump?
---
As it stood, naxx gear was viable until t4 replacement or further in many cases.
---
To make it even less of a jump...
---
BoD mythic came out jan 29 2019.
---
10th Jaina kill - February 11 2019.
---
This is in a MUCH more competitive and much more extreme environment. And it still took almost 2 weeks.
---
I honestly can't even begin to express how much higher the bar is now than before in order to achieve a top 10.
---
I'd honestly say it would be fairer to compare to a top 50. Which puts you at march 1st for the kill. 
---
It's very easy to pull dates and examples to fit a narrative, especially when you don't actually offer any solutions.
---
Also, when you chuck in things like "easy as fuck" difficulty - in a game which has FAR more difficult endgame raiding now than it ever had it makes your viewpoint seem a bit less informed.
---
Shame, you just described classic in 2 years time.
---
The second R14 on my faction was actually someone who paid a service to power farm honor lol.  Was an Orc Rogue.  It was so obvious he was power farmed that he was humiliated when he took back over his account. He transferred to another server.
---
So yeah they definitely hit R14 without a group.  Definitely possible.... just difficult :)
---
Yes. I’ve been in the previous two and have been flagged for this next one as well.
---
My reddit account? What does that have to do with anything
---
Thanks for the input!
---
never liked playing on pvp servers back in the day and will roll on a PvE server again and enjoy the game like always and go to AV and get my fill of pvp when I want to.
---
Thank you for understanding what I mean
---
I thought servers couldn't have more than about 5k + peopleat once. I would assume 10k+ people in and out of a server daily for a very populated server would be very doable then. Never more 20 minutes queue time. But I don't know
---
It's good bait though
---
That would be interesting and I've been wondering the same thing.
---
they should be, they were def there in 1.12
---
Honestly not really, warcraft launch's have been, at least for me, seemless and perfect, the worst I have ever experienced was a brief delay in WoD when everyone horde side bottlenecked at clicking that spyglass.
---
And if I do somehow experience some sort of problem during the launch days that make the game unplayable, of well that sucks, I'll be behind my friends if they are able to play and if they aren't able to play like me then really no big loss, being the first to 60 isn't my goal, it's the journey not the destination.
---
Thanks for the repost, here’s your nice block.
---
It's a fresh server on an official blizzard server - low to no chance of GMs doing shady things and way more people are going to play Classic than any of the private servers.
---
Guy I work with is so obsessed with humans. I'm like Nate why play a dumb bald guy when you're a dumb bald guy irl so fucking lame.
---
It doesnt have to be an exploit to be trash
---
Why does every thread about PvE/PvP servers **always** turn into a shitfest? 
---
Seriously, does it *really* bother you that much that somebody else prefers to play on a certain server?
---
Fucj u
---
No, there's a way to do it.  I don't recall the method atm.
---
Most people are loot hungry like me, beating super easy vanilla boss after 2-3 weeks gets boring

**INTRODUCTION**
---
Reforged is a guild built specifically for WoW Classic, consisting of very experienced and passionate World of Warcraft raiders, dating back to the beginning of Vanilla.

Wasn’t there a period of time it was a physical effect and could be dodged?
---
"Below Average Joes"
---
Unless there is a much larger number of people, it may be an issue. It also has people creating characters all in the same spot, which may be a bit of a bigger issue than an expansion launch. So, possibly but not likely to be super broken.
---
I agree, 100%.  I just wanted to watch some videos of pserver heroes running in, and get owned, while they freak out.   
---
I find that kind of stuff hilarious.
---
Is there a way to see items that are second-best in slot? Just thinking like boe world drop epics that I probably won't get my hands on.
---
**&lt;Zz&gt; | Alliance | NA - PVP |  6pm - 10 pm PST Sunday - Thursday (as needed) | Hardcore PVE and PVP Guild**
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Zz&gt; is comprised of a core of 15 veteran World of Warcraft players, our leadership has cleared through Naxxramas on Private servers and has raided in top retail guilds such as &lt;Gentleman's Club&gt; and &lt;Midwinter&gt;. We are eager to find players that want to bring a hardcore mindset to Classic.
---
**Goals on launch:** Our first goal will be to achieve a **World Top 5 Ragnaros** and as such we are looking for people interested in leveling quickly and diving straight into the end-game content. We are confident that we can kill Ragnaros by day 9 if not faster.
---
**Goals beyond launch:** Once we have killed Ragnaros we are going to be forming a second raid and will look to form a 2nd raid before the end of the first month in preparation for phase 2. Once phase 2 begins we will be pushing to get as many people to Rank 14 as possible.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday 6pm-10pm PST, Early on you can expect the weekly raid commitment to be only about 2 hours per week since it will just be Molten Core and Onyxia. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with raiding Sunday and Monday as extra raid days for new content releases and split raids.
---
**What we are looking for:** We are looking for players who want to play Classic with a hardcore mentality, we will be pushing to be one of the best PVE guilds in the world as well as pushing to be one of most feared PVP guilds in our battlegroup. **We are also currently recruiting players who want to focus on professions (Herbalism, Mining, etc.).** 
---
**How to Apply:** It's as easy as sending in an application! &lt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link&gt;
---
Feel free to  DM me with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
Ofc not, but something being thrash is not a reason for it to be removed.
---
A whole guild of 7% body fat nerds. &lt;OMADderall&gt; guild in the house.

I did let my gf play a bit just to get used to some of the basic things. She's not used to playing pc games at all, thought it be good to give her a basic understanding if the game, hiw things work. But now that we got there ye no "wow" no more, it just isn't really wow.
---
Yes, but the difference between paladins and shamans is that shamans have two viable PvP specs - one autistic impotent whirlwind where they mistakenly believe they're contributing, and one of the absolute scariest casters that can kill from 30 meters away.
---
Enhancement's a meme. Elemental is crazy good.
---
Just disable themed designs for sub reddits u goober
---
[Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raTts-iGixU)
---
Honestly, if this sub was an indication of the Classic community I'd find it hard to ever enjoy. Luckily I don't believe it is - this sub is full of elitist circlejerks from pservers that spend the last decade hating on retail and making collective opinions on most things that you are not allowed to disagree with. Of course there are also many nice people here and some quality content, but the ratio of the two kind of people is just really bad on here.
---
My biggest fear would be that a year or two down the road most people except those elitists have quit vanilla, but I hope it won't happen.
---
Casual guilds will be the ones that probably abuse it the most.
---
Damn, that would of been a red flag to me that they were lazy, time management problems, and leaves burdens for others to carry. XD
---
Nah I think it’ll be smooth. They’re doing enough testing that I think there won’t be any server issues(I could be wrong though)
---
Plus, if worse comes to worse, I still took the day off
---
You linked a thread with people advocating against world buffs.  This thread supports my points - that people think they are annoying to get/utilize. Even the OP changed their opinion on this in an edit. Nobody is calling them exploits.
---
I've tried on the closed beta /camp or logging in and out or using /unstuck doesn't work. This only worked on Pservers because they are broken.
---
Jokes on you, I put soul stone on myself...
---
Ironclaw. Let me guess. You play a gnome mage ?
---
And what about people wanting TBC or TBC+ thats kind of egoistic imo ?
---
&gt;I'll take you up on your offer and ask you a couple more questions. Hand of Edward the Odd, 1.60 speed - do you think it might be a decent tanking weapon? Or too gimmicky?
---
It's okey. The speed is good for tanking. The int is nice. The proc however I find only situationally decent. Paladin threat from healing is lower than other classes to begin with, and healing threat gets divided over the number of mobs you are in combat with.
---
Heals also cost quite a significant amount of mana when you are wearing tank gear. It's a cool weapon, and it's really good for AoE farming when you can get heals off instantly without leaving yourself open to attack (You cannot Block, Parry or Dodge while casting spells).
---
However, the mace can go for up to 500+ gold judging from private server economies, so I would not personally spend that much gold unless you also plan to do a lot of aoe farming or PvP where the mace can really shine.
---
&gt;And [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzPUwAQ_p8xxAA) is the build I'm thinking of going with at 60. It's intended to be viable for casual raid healing (with Illumination) and tanking 5-mans. I went with 2/2 Guardian's Favor for more BoPs as a pseudotaunt, 3/3 Imp HoJ for more stuns to deal with caster mobs/if I lose threat on a mob. Couldn't decide between Toughness and Anticipation, so I just went with more armor. 
---
It's a good build. I would personally not skip one handed weapon specialization. The talent not only boost your white damage, but it also boost your Seal of Righteousness which is your bread and butter threat generating talent. If you only tank 5mans, you wont need Toughness. It will amount to 3-4% less damage taken in dungeons where mobs typically hit for 100-200 damage. Not worth sacrificing threat in my opinion.'
---
This is the build I plan on using myself. Nearly identical to yours.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzPUwAQ\_HzHpAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzPUwAQ_HzHpAA) 
---
&gt; EDIT: one more question. Is the weapon skill from Human absolutely vital? If not I'm rolling Dwarf 
---
If you plan on tanking 5man or raid trash. No, not at all.
---
If you plan on tanking bosses however the talent actually does give you a significant increase. Private servers have incorrectly assumed based on lack of information that weapon skill primarily decreased the damage penalty from glancing blows. However after Blizzard clarified how the weapon skill actually work, we now know that chance to hit gets calculated differently depending on how big the difference between your own weapon skill and the enemies defense skill is.
---
Having just +5 weapon skill will lower the +hit needed on gear to cap by a whopping **3%** (!) this is actually quite significant as landing more whitehits directly result in more Seal of Righteousness hits and more returned mana from Judgement of Wisdom. It means a Human Paladin with Precision only need 3% hit from gear to reach hitcap, while a Dwarf will need 6%. With the available itemization in Classic, a Dwarf Paladin will never reach hitcap as a tank.
---
The formula for hit from weapon skill is the following:
---
    If the target is a mob and defense minus attack rating is 11 or more:
---
        MissChance = 5% + (TargetLevel*5 - AttackerSkill) * 0.2%
---
    If the target is a mob and defense minus attack rating is 10 or less:
---
        MissChance = 5% + (TargetLevel*5 - AttackerSkill) * 0.1%
---
For a Human using Sword or Mace the amount of hit required is this:
---
    5 + (((63*5) - 305) * 0.1) = 6
---
For a Dwarf or Human using Axes, the formula is the following:
---
    5 + (((63*5) - 300) * 0.2 ) = 8
---
Additionally we know that with just 300 weapon skill, the boss will ignore the first % of hit from your gear which means that with no weapon skill, you you need 9% hit to cap. This puts a non human with Precision at 6% required hit from gear.
---
Alright, so this seem significant, and if you are going for absolute max PvE efficiency then Human is the clear choice. However I dont actually know what the difference between them is in terms of actual threat per second. It might not be that significant in the end, although Human definately will produce more threat on a raid boss.
---
I am probably picking Dwarf myself just because I 1) Like them more, and 2) Stoneform is great for PvP.
---
What's a keyboard
---
Please make it multi-lingual !
---
U can tank in vanilla
---
Not even one. Classic Spell Effects are more beautiful and authentic than the flashy eww from nowadays, which blinks all the time hugely in the same patterns of the rotation. The first time it's maybe nice, but after a few uses of the spell it's just annoying in retail and disturbs my immersion.
---
pretty much this!
---
You thats true but, consider this. As a Shaman when you do BG's. You don't have to shit away all your mana buffing and then waste time drinking every time you res. Also unlike a priest. You don't have dispel magic so your never the "prime" sheep target. So thats pretty fucking sweet.
---
Xumouse.   Would click for you every 10 seconds.
---
You can get all the PvP you want on a PvE server.
---
If you like being jumped with no notice just /pvp when you first log in and be done with it.
---
You'll find tons of blues that will see you in a bad spot and attempt to jump you.
---
What you don't have to worry about, is killing someone that doesn't want to fight.
---
So the PvPers you do face tend to better quality, not some crappy player that has to go to a zone 20+ levels below themselves  just to hope to survive in a PvP fight.
---
Or the hunter tanks with pet while controlling the rest :)
---
No one would have threat issues in a guild where everyone is doing 200 dps.
---
Where are you getting that warrs have 1 percent more miss chance
---
Haha yes you gotta take a break from it all at some point, come back a week or so before launch and I'm sure it'll pump you right up to where you need to be.
---
I think it involved inviting someone into the group.  I am not sure.  Maybe making a raid, idk.  I am pretty sure someone said you could still do it though.
---
Isn't Tailoring a moneymaker thanks to bags? I didn't play until Wrath, so forgive my ignorance.
---
&gt;Well and now it's neither challenging nor punishing.
---
Because at 60, there's very little content to actually explore compared to retail - In vanilla getting to 60 is the journey, in retail the journey starts at 120. They're different games, get over it. 
---
basically, you don't like progression. So you would like to go straight to naxx when you hit 60? ok...
---
Hahah same!
---
Druid-mana
---
It feels like it was yesterday when the Timer said 71 days. 
---
Those were dark times.
---
I didn’t say there was zero homogenization, just that imo it didn’t get BAD until after.
---
You also need to take into account how many classes were genuinely fun and engaging to play in MoP. Blizzard took a completely different approach to class design than they really ever did outside of MoP.
---
I’m not saying MoP was perfect, but their design philosophy during that time was more focused on being fun and engaging than probably any other time. 
---
If Blizzard was starting from the beginning, I’d love for them to take that kind of approach to class design again.
---
you cant carry more than one hearthstone so youd have to trade it and make another
---
Very Nice!  
---
Can you have an option of Phase 1, Pre-Raid which would list all the best item before you get in any raid at all?  
---
That would be amazing!
---
I'd recommend this one instead;

People resisting your traps, is awful. Making your Traps last longer and Melee stronger so you can swing it hard and get out asap, is a good idea. Especially if you get Stuck there in melee with someone. I really like the effects of Entrapment, but I think I'd rather have Imp Wing Clip and at least 4 out of 5. Then again AV having Entrapment is freaking fantastic. You'll be spamming one of the two anyways. As a PvP Hunter, you want the highest damage increases, with the best Utility that prevents or gets you out of deadzone/melee areas of other players. The Agility and Crit is nice, but it never did the job for me in comparison to putting points elsewhere. 
---
Your spec looks good, regardless. I just prefer the above for PvP as it's done me well. That 15% on MS is really nice for burst damage.
---
Our raid group 2 on the weekend could be a possible match for you.
---
In Classic I can farm consumables for 3 says straight on my schedule and supply myself for weeks or months.
---
BFA systems force daily or weekly logins to keep up with the systems grind. Progression is time gated to encourage or force this. 
---
BFA is just as grindy as Classic, in a far more annoying way.
---
Watch the video and read the comments.

Meh, rank 14 is thinking at lvl 60.   It's all the same crap.
---
Moonkin is probably the only hybrid dps class that can 100% compete on vael but nowhere else. 
---
Vael does almost nothing for enhance, ret paladins, etc.
---
&gt;There's more PVP on PVE servers than you might expect. People do flag themselves in popular world PVP spots for big battles and also while leveling.
---
This is going to be especially true when we have to wait (?) months until BGs are released. There are plenty of PVPers on PVE servers - they're gonna want to spill blood.
---
www.vanillafriends.com might help those looking to reconnect
---
You would think... turns out the warlock was his alt and he was asked to come on the alt specifically for the Garr fight. It could of been a red flag against me because in hindsight I overreacted a bit with my message. I’m lucky he felt compelled to impress me after that strongly worded whisper.
---
Guess I should just find a TBC pserver then
---
nope. and nobody is... cause the dungeon isn't hard enough to require it  ( other than random people getting lost in BFD ).
---
worst case scenario, you'd put a sheep marker over a mob... but that's too much for low-level dungeon.
---
Nah
---
Edit, for what it's worth it's a solid foundation you have there and will help people a lot so keep up the good work
---
Most of the time you could find dps just by stepping outside of the zone, and talking in /1. Now whether or not that dps would be any better than the one you just kicked...
---
Idk man, you really sound like you got something to prove.
---
Why both? Why engineering
---
I really want the dungeon companion but it's so expensive.
---
Talibananas?
---
This is with a few minor changes from time to time is the build I ran with most of Vanilla for Raiding and PvP.  It proved to be quite good at both.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxZViohthtfV0mo
---
Looking at your spec you really need 5/5 in efficiency, running out of mana in PvP is death for a hunter.
---
I like the idea of having a little red cart you drag around with you that holds your totems. Apparently we can't all be BAMFS like Cairne and, just back pack that shit. I hate his model. That stupid back pack looks horrible but, at the same time. I so wish I had one.
---
Judgment of the crusader + sanctity aura for a bunch of smite priest dps.  Gotta go full holy for that though.
---
It will be a shitshow, login server will keep going down, people will be on the forums yelling and screaming how incompetent blizzard is. People will be on the forums complaining that they cannot do any quests because anything that spawns is instantly tagged by someone else.

Oh! Gotcha now. Didn't make that connection, decent example

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Wed or Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: 
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing. 
---
Raid Schedule:
---
We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST and will pick between Tues, Wed, and Thurs when it becomes more relevant. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first. 
---
Player Expectations: 
---
We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That being said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient. Players should also aim for at least 80%+ attendance.
---
As we will also wish to continue clearing the raids after MC, the number of players using meme specs will be capped and approved on a case-by-case basis only after you have shown that you are willing to go the extra mile that is needed to perform.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game. 
---
On Culture:
---
&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit. 
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel
---
https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb
---
I didn't realize that. Shows how infrequently my guild used those buffs, lol.
---
This. Also Kamelot I played over and over while grinding
---
Well if you would like to see more conversation try initiating it.
---
What do mages have for threat reduction?
---
Hey - just about anything is better than the current implementation of layering, so I am with you on that, my friend.
---
your friends are scrubs and will not last long in the game.  go play on the pvp server and find new friends
---
Funny enough, there was a lock in my raiding guild back in wrath who always had excuses. Named Supersteve. God I hated that guy
---
All pre- raid content can if needed be tanked by rogue / hunter pet, so I'm going to be fine with some ego inflated warrior leaving :)
---
You genuinely have no idea what you're talking about.
---
It worked fine.    Just dummies didn't understand because it wouldn't show in a "meter"
---
So they dumbed in down.   Where everyone had support and everyone had dps.
---
Healers are Kindof a support
---
Bloodlust didn't exist in vanilla.
---
a bunch of scrub carebears picking flowers together in field...
---
yawn...
---
You forgot the 5 guys getting rides to and from quests in a fucking Butler bike
---
The biggest difference is the lack of danger or random world PvP.  When you grind or quest you only have to worry about the mobs. To me that makes the game feel empty and boring.
---
Agree. I love wrath mostly because of the memories with my friends and Ulduar. But TBC was peak for me as well. There was no need for CC in wrath. Dungeons were not challenging at all.
---
Feels like just yesterday I was looking at the dreaded 100 days. Soon enough, brothers and sisters. We will meet soon.
---
they should really rename PvE servers to "scrubs and carebears"
---
Definitely a good thing to consider. I hope faction balance is good enough to make world dragons actually competitive come time for them.
---
No survivalist. No lightning reflex.
---
To answer your question, no.
---
Thanks for this! Nobody ever touched the feralas harpies back in the day and it was such a good area
---
I would have liked this, but the Horde make me sick to my stomach.
---
&gt; Blizzard has said if you were in the first 2 stress tests, you will be invited to Stress Test #3. 
---
Yeah OP Ill request a source for that one.
---
Why would they bother with bringing back stress test tab to our accounts so we can uninstall if they will bring us back for the stress test just a few days after?
---
I'm sure the people no lifeing for server firsts will let everyone know what they did....
---
And that's why whenever you level a pally you really should find a partner. What paladins lack in offensive interactivity they make up for in spades in support utility. However, you need other players around to actually support for that play style to kick in. If you're all about soloing, I'd avoid paladin like the plague. However if you're social at all, paladins are really fun.
---
Not having concussive stun so your shots cost 20-30 less mana.
---
im pretty sure they got plenty of gold kickbacks
---
Thanks for your valuable input. Good chat.

I remember most of the members of the high end progression guilds having these on my server
---
"Tryhard" is a term for someone who puts on a lot of superficial effort in a situation in which it isn't warranted or has minimal impact. There is no context in which is a positive term, whether you're in a casual context or a hardcore context or a middle-of-the-road context.
---
It's an ironic term. It's not meant to describe people who put in genuine effort where warranted for genuinely good results. The idea is that you "try really hard" but don't actually get the desired output or impact.
---
It will be full of issues. It will also be the most fun classic is capable of giving. Each day that passes the fun will diminish a little bit. 
---
Also we’re taking offf enough time that even if we don’t get to play day 1, it’s not a huge loss. 
---
I’m at 2.5 weeks right now. I’ll be increase it 1-4 days after July

I'm not sure where you getting this.
---
There was no private servers, when original was out, so there is no direct comparison.
---
The only thing you have to compare is private server you tubers that made it into classic.
---
Just seeing any you tuber going from edited to live on twitch, is going to give you a real sense of "highlight reel" versus "real time". It's not that they suddenly suck, it's that your seeing all of the experiance, not just the big crits, the perfect luck fights.
---
retail vanilla? because t. backpacks were incredibly rade in vanilla.
---
Go to the Classic forums and click on the dev tracker. Blizzard staff said this exactly: if you were in the first 2 stress tests, you will be in the next one.
---
This just shows most people who set up their UIs are bad.  This is what a clean UI should look like. 
---

---
Well.... Healers down rank their spells so even if the healer has only 2 heals for example. Down ranking it you end up with 6 buttons to press all depending on the situation.
---
Needs more Emboss
---
You will NOT melt faces in PvP
---
I'm rerolling my old dwarf hunter for the same reason you said, I was awful.  I want to redeem myself.

Well if we go that route, what about people wanting WOTLK?
---
Looks great. Just needs 5/5 parry. It helps more than you think.
---
I'm sure I've seen this post at least three times now....
---
Ah. Never read or watched that. All I know is that I wouldn't find this by googling "wow own portrait elite addon".
---
Yeah that video is SO wrong, it would take a long time to write it all out. The whole thing was really infuriating. The guy's lying, outright, and thinks pserv is like Vanilla. 
---
Sadly, people who don't know better, believe what he says is true.
---
Sounds like a you problem
---
True shot aura is a must for pve
---
Again, this is a very small YouTube with a small following. Just because they have an opinion that some people may agree with, doesn't mean they speak for the classic community. If you spend enough time on this sub you'll realize there are a lot more people that want to keep the game as close to authentic as possible than there are that would agree with this YouTuber.
---
What you need is to have a bribed younger sibling pressing the key for you....
---
Agreed. 5 years on Pservers. After playing closed beta and AV... Private servers feel janky as fuck. Everything feels off.
---
Hello, Everyone. I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders. We our a casual family-oriented guild recruiting for classic.
---
Our goal: Provide a guild for adults, and their families to play on. If you work 50+ hours a week, and have 3 kiddos like I do, you’re perfect. We will complete all end game content whether it is PVP or PVE, depending on your goals. 
---
Raid hours: Friday and Saturday 8pm to 12 am CST
---
Server: PVP, CST
---
Reach me at:
---
Discord: Algammon#1375

Shaman: dps blows. Really enjoyed enhancement and elemental in pve after vanilla. 
---
Also, totem quests.
---
&gt;Thanks to your stupid threads and arguments I will have way less time for my kids, just remember that. YOU are responsible for this not me.
---
Did you just blame the community for your spending less time with your kids?  I mean... you could simply not play and be a dad.  That's your choice bro, not anyone else's.
---
I’m borderline technologically retarded when it comes to the actual functionality behind the screens, but now a days I always read posts from data miner’s who have more details on new game functions than the devs put in their patch notes. Like I said, I really have no formal understanding of the logic functions being communicated between client and server for each action, but shouldn’t we be able to process this data is some capacity given the access to their code Blizzard grants through add-on
---
A real nerd would be reading the Silmarillion :D
---
Despite already answered, I had a good chuckle with your text well done.
---
I don’t see what this adds or detracts from so why say it?
---
I know of multiple guilds on retail vanilla that would kill Ony and Hakkar every opportunity to get her buff for whichever raid boss they were progressing on that week in AQ40 and Naxx, Nefs head was also used but obviously more cumbersome to get with a longer lockout so wasn't used as often but was still used.
---
Copy pasta folks, move along
---
ok retard
---
I always loved the original holy spell glow/swirly thing. 
---
I enchanted several weapons in BC with +81(71?) healing after I got upgrades for fun.
---
That's just not what most people use the term for and doesn't reflect its origins.
---
&gt;concussive stun
---
Never worked with my play style.  When it did go off during a kite, it took to long to exploit and the stun was quite short.  I don't like relying on random effects when it comes to kiting.  It's useful if you're spamming it hoping to proc a stun, but I generally preferred to burst people down at the right movement over hoping for something to proc.
---
You can pick it up online in pdf format for free
---
I don't see any hypocrisy. It's not about punishing anyone, it's about avoiding people with toxic attitudes. The game is supposed to be enjoyable!
---
I read that you are making rash generalization about a game after experiencing one bad group in a non ideal setting.  If you ever have criticized someone for making the same assumptions and generalizations about classic wow or another game or sport you have played, then you are a hypocrite.
---
I’m borderline technologically retarded when it comes to the actual functionality behind the screens, but now a days I always read posts from data miner’s who have more details on new game functions than the devs put in their patch notes. Like I said, I really have no formal understanding of the logic functions being communicated between client and server for each action, but shouldn’t we be able to process this data is some capacity given the access to their code Blizzard grants through add-on development and what not? Forgive my ignorance
---
Speaking as somebody who doesn’t really have much time to play any games due to various life commitments unfortunately my advice is, and this is going to be probably shot down: don’t play.
---
End of the day classic WoW is going to be exactly as WoW was at launch (well 1.12). This means no teleporting, walking to dungeons, expensive mounts and all that comes with it.
---
Don’t get me wrong, the absence of these things is putting me off playing, but it is what it is. Blizzard are supplying a product, you can play if you want, you don’t have to if you don’t want. It’s as simple as that.
---
Let the mages know. Instant blizzard before he hops around spamming arcane explosion is a tiring sight.
---
This is the frustration of a man who never learned how to pull out.
---
Very nice
---
Looks cozy! Every set up needs lots of plants, makes a world of difference.
---
Also, nice posters.
---
The pacing on all classes is much slower. So the “feel” of the class will be different. 
---
Paladins do fine. Just don’t expect to be tanking outside of 5 mans (and even then most groups would rather have a warrior) or topping DPS meters in raids. Prot has no taunt and goes OOM to quickly to effectively hold threat. Ret brings nothing to the table another holy paladin couldn’t dip into ret to get beyond Imp Ret Aura which is trash. 
---
After they hit MC gear level they become monsters in healing though.  But your options for heals will be limited. A lot of down ranking holy light and flash of light. You have a bunch of utility spells that are great especially in PVP. A warrior with a cleaning freedom bot behind him is unstoppable. If a defensive support role sounds good to you then paladin is a good choice.
---
Yeah I know but there's just something about having the actual book that I love.
---
This guy warriors.
---
Yeah, i might have been wrong about it being a "pretty common opinion" but seeing that thread yesterday it atleast felt like some honestly think they are an exploit.
---
How do these runs work loot wise, like, is there any social pressure to share loot even if you already won the roll on stuff earlier?
---
As a tank, I like to use my gat to pull.
---
Are they just meme specs because they're bad in comparison to other specs?
---
Some tanks are slow as fuck, and need some incentive though.
---
but walking is TOO HARD. and trying to use my brain to figure out where to go is TOO HARD. ME NEED INSTANT GRATIFICATION
---
Yeah dude you get a good 2h and mongoose bite hits for a fuck ton
---
Yeah absolutely, i was just amazed it was even something a few people believed.
---
Honestly on some servers it was often 8 or 9 twinks + a random or two Vs 8 or 9 twinks + a random or two, so no it wasn't always because they sucked at high level. For many it was because raiding at a high level to become a 60 twink was a huge timesink by the time you took raid nights and consumable farming during downtimes into account and they simply didn't have the time to keep being in the progression rut.
---
Yes, retail vanilla. Not really. You just have to know what level mobs to grind and be able to kill them quickly. 
---
They were fairly cheap at the AH towards the end of vanilla. I had all of my characters equipped with 3-4 each. 
---
I made one mooncloth bag and never made another.
---
I am not, no.
---
Yup. I never did battlegrounds or arenas in retail and I plan on sticking to just enjoying the leveling and endgame raiding. Some people like PvP and that’s ok. I don’t so PvE is perfect for me.
---
These are pretty awesome! Using MC and Ony on our guildsite for now. :)
---
Pro tip: when you replace your first soul shard bag, pop it in the bank and fill the bag with extra shards. It’s really convenient to have a supply of shards you can just grab from the bank. 
---
Ex: you log in with no shards and your buddy whispers you there’s a huge battle at TM vs SS. Grab your stash and you are good to go at a moments notice
---
Beat me to it.
---
You should change your play style.
---
If you're talking about elite or professional gamers, they tend to stay current because that's where the money or the competition is. Why would someone like that play on basically a pirated game where they can't promote or monetize. 
---
If you're talking about the average Joe, in my experience, the average private server player was better at wow than the average retail player. Your average casual gamer wasn't likely to go through all the hoops needed to connect to a private server hosting a decade old game. Lots of people I played with on private were either competitive/professional gamers for other games or were/are in top 100 world guilds in retail.
---
Don't underestimate the traffic you will get once the word spreads. I don't know your provider, but most have some limits or terms like fair use.

I wouldnt mind ads.

Feature I love and missed from other sites: Shopping list on mobile! Since I don't have a second screen, this is what I was missing.

**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: Loot Council, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exactly details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time.

Everyone seems to forget about "wrath babies" in all these discussions..
---
lol riiiiiiiiiiiggghhhhht. Let’s not forget the 250k petition there, chub.
---
Is this not punishing the whole group? Is it not analogous to the tank punishing the dps? How is it not an attempt to teach aggressive lessons (in the name of punishing that very same behavior)? It isn't an identical act - obviously - but surely the analogy is apparent.
---
Disregard that input. That is absolutely blasphemous. It not only increases humanoid damage, but it also increases crit damage to humanoids. It is absolutely mandatory
---
Dear everyone else, please save me from myself.
---
O well sucks to be you, nerd
---
280,036 of them to be exact.
---
Mark Kern joined in on this trend, along with many of the big big streamers (even Sodapoppin). 
---
The Nostalrius devs were invited to Blizzard for a chat.
---
I'm not trying to diminish the effort made by the rest of the community at all, just pointing out that this private server probably played a huge part in the decision.
---
Mr. Brightside-The Killers
---
That's because you were MT, you didn't need anything, now that UI is horrible sure but a healer for instance would have wanted some form of healbot esque add-on to make life a lot easier.
---
I did a bunch of AVs. 1 on every class alliance side. Plus some more on a few. 
---
Most lasted longer than 2 hours. Only a few didn’t summon Ivus. I had 2 that lasted longer than 10 hours. Though one of them I came into at the end. 
---
It’s pretty much what AV was in patch 1.12
---
If you want modern ways play retail. We're going back to the times were you was properly rewarded for time spent. Now a days it's adhd rewards everywhere
---
Well yeah but you're comparing two different worlds with different kinds of stat priority, scaling, and just general gearing logic. 
---
The difference between say MC tank shields and Naxx tank shields seems tiny by today's standard, but by the standard of Vanilla it was pretty damn significant. I'm not arguing that you didn't feel the power scale in Vanilla. I'm arguing that they weren't "smaller upgrades", because the system was fundamentally different.
---
Just reducing the ilvl 'inflation' would either mean just closing the gaps between raids, which leads to potential overgearing issues, or a large scale rework of itemization, which is a long fucking project that they can't just randomly drop in the middle of an xpac.
---
During the AQ War Event, C'thun would randomly MC people in several zones and cause the player to attack anything and everything around them. I remember this happening because the player got really mad that they lost a huge amount of goblin rep by Old God mode-ing a Gadgetzan Bruiser. I want to know if C'thun says anything before, during, or after the mind control takes place. All of the videos uploaded at the time are so shitty that you can't read the chatbox on any of them, and after so long, nobody remembers it and most of the websites that had AQ War tidbits are defunct or deleted. 
---
So, one of my long term goals in Classic is to make it to the release of the War Effort so I can find out if C'thun whispers the target, or not.
---
Those addons and macros didn't last long in Vanilla. They all got taken out by blizzard.
---
Brings me back.
---
that hasn't happened to me once during the beta. everyone ive grouped with has been really honest, nobody has rage quit, and everyone tries to do their job well
---
“People play more than me. It’s not fair! Blizzard do something! Waaaaaaah.”
---
This is cool as hell. One thing I noticed when looking at lower level suggestions was that sometimes it suggested unobtainable items - for example, for my paladin it suggested I get Seal of Sylvannas, which is horde only.
---
I was also confused by the EP system, though that might just be my own fault. I specified my talent spec as prot, then added the holy ep and ret ep (because it made me?). Then when I auto generated a gear set, it forced me to pick the holy ep thing. The suggestion then was almost entirely cloth and int gear. Was this just a weighting thing, where it was prioritizing int over armor, Stam, str, etc? It didn't seem like ANY of the gear it suggested was optimal because of the low armor, like it was ONLY caring about holy.
---
pewpew
---
Yea disagreed. I'm sub an still play arena and raid. I honestly doubt that you're still subbed.
---
Alleviating the pain in the sense of being able to actually log in and play. Nothing will make the mass of players in Elwynn Forest any easier to compete with.
---
Ah, right.
---
Cleave did enough anyway really. Was a bitch tabbing through the targets but it worked really well.
---
250k people signed the petition, chub.
---
You shouldn't hang off a streamers nutsack taking everything they say to heart...
---
Anyone got some parmesan cheese for this pasta?
---
I expect to not be able to play on Monday night. Hoping things will settle by Tuesday morning.
---
Jokes on you, I just die because I’m the priest and I’m OOM.
---
I think there are some confusion.
---
World buffs in Classic are no where near as plentiful as they are on private servers.
---
There are tons of timers and cool downs that prevent just "grabbing" all the world buffs at anytime, before you start raiding for the evening. So in classic your going to need to coordinate with other large guilds about exactly when to drop raid buffs, Otherwise, a guild will drop them early, and your guild is going to SOL for quite some time.
---
Why don’t you just limit yourself to 8 hours and not worry about what other people are doing? Merica baby
---
By that logic those people who don't play private servers but wanted and pushed for classic are also a drop in the bucket as well.
---
I wish I could be a fly on the wall when you get called into parent teacher interviews and the teacher asks why you aren't helping your grade 5 child who is reading at a grade 1 level improve and you blame r/classicwow for not wanting changes to this game thus not giving you any time to spend with your kids.
---
I got suggested an engi helm, so it looks like it is suggesting green boes?
---
This was my buddy back in the day, Zuulo. His knowledge of the game was just stupid. If it wasn't for him I'd probably still be a massive noob at the game.
---
Ofc
---
How many launches have their been since D3? How'd they go?
---
Buy a Noblechairs - best Chair ever
---
What did they get?
---
They implemented a system kinda like that in the beta. Before the inclusion of rested xp, there was an exhaustion system that cut your xp gains to 25% until you logged out and let your character "rest". Needless to say, gamers did not take to kindly to being told how long they could play a game and it was changed to what it is now.
---
you no take candle
---
I remember my brother and I took shifts when we both got addicted to our first MMO, the text based Gemstone III. That poor computer ran 24/7.
---
Those goddamn 4 mounted Alliance Elites roaming the southern barrens road are my personal nightmare.
---
I mean they did get flown out to talk to blizzard about classic wow.
---
Oh wow, 250k, so many compared to millions
---
I never thought much of it at first. Then I saw the Leeroy Jenkins video and it became my second favorite instance after Blackrock Depths.
---
You've got it backwards.
---
People who are keen to look for private servers and set them up, even years after the game has moved on are way more into it and significantly better on average than those who played in the real vanilla. 
---
It's super obvious if you play at max level on private servers in recent years after having played in 2005-2006. A lot of it is also, of course, because people have had years to figure out what works best and for the information to be easily available.
---
The best, or the more eager to play fast, so the less patients.. I love to heal in dungeon, but this toxic mentality to run and run turned me down.. But we will see
---
Well if u ask me, blizzard should remake the trilogy of WoW because its the golden age, since cataclysm had a huge decline in numbers it shouldn't even be in talk.
---
Hunter Dead Zone.  I think all hunters would admit to this.
---
&gt; People complain that retail is straight forward, zero choice, predetermined
---
Yeah lets create that imaginary vanilla where people weren't copy pasting optimal builds since 2005. At this point reddits interpretation of classic is entirely fiction.
---
I swear I have seen this exact, word for word post 4 or 5 times
---
The other 99 of these posts
---
Nice troll post, nothing to see here.
---
If you want to compete with the no-lifers, you can easily become a NEET and do so.  As you've pointed out - they sacrifice almost every other aspect of their life - you can make the same choice.
---
Life is full of trade-offs like this. Get used to it.
---
Yeah seems I am a bit too late already
---
A lot of people are going to create their characters 2 weeks before launch.
---
&gt;average hardcore gamer
---
if you’re playing less than 8h per day you’re no longer a hardcore gamer
---
You want everyone to be casuals.
---
Troll post is trolling. If not a troll then. Hey buddy BFA is that way&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Also 5 kids? Dude maybe get the snip bro. The planet has enough people.
---
there is not a way to get back to enter the confirmation number if you go away from that screen.
---
Wtf bruh
---
The glare from that window is going to drive you nuts. If you switch the side monitor from the right to the left, you can likely obscure some center monitor glare too.
---
That’s the main reason I can’t lock in on one. 
---
Warriors, it’s easy to find people to play with because everyone needs a tank. The drawback is I’m not doing pvp with sword and board. So re spec often, idk if I will have the coin for that. 
---
Rogues, one spec for both and one set of gear. BUT, it’s probably the most over played class and they are a dime a dozen. Not in demand, and easily replaced. 
---
What are the other options here? Feral Druid? I recall kitty form not being as strong as rogues. Ret pally is taboo for some reason. Enh shammy I think we’re decent but I’m pretty sure we are going blue side. Choices choices lol.
---
Yeah back when it was a 31 point talent.
---
DAOC wasn't designed around 40, 20, or 25 man raids. It was designed around PvP. Some spec could be garbage in a dragon or prince raid but it doesn't really matter because PvE was always a piece of side-content. Even the "harder" PvE content was more of a matter of having a proper group composition and not being an idiot rather than challenging content. 
---
You can't make a game with strict DPS/healing requirements and at the same time expect people to be okay with the idea of a "support" role. The direction WoW went was inevitable with them focusing on raids being an important pillar of the game. 
---
Honestly, if you look at PvP, you have seen more hybrid type builds for BG/RBG type content, where versatility/utility is more important, and the metric most important at the end of the day is whether you won or not.
---
When I was a raid officer I used to always check people's shirts, it was a sign that they made an extra effort
---
I probably just level a buch of alts. I know ill be consume by this, if retail still hooks me in. Classic wont help
---
Clout
---
Mage: Vending machine and frostbolt spam raiding...
---
Or alternatively just clear the pull without relying on heals in the first place.
---
Some people might try to pressure you by saying something like "hey you already won something" blah blah blah. If you're with friends or you want to share the wealth go for it, but don't expect them to do the same for you. In general I'd say roll on it and let the RNG decide. 
---
Outside of the reserved item I haven't seen anything different from a standard group, though I have seen plenty of people complain that the reserved piece went to the person reserving it. Generally they are complaining that they didn't see the reservation or whatever.
---
The only type of run of this variety that I'm not sure how it functions is reserving the first orb or any number of righteous orbs from live side strat. Since it's a green item master looting isn't a great option and people could easily free roll on whatever drops if you don't Master loot.
---
WhAT AbOuT cMaNgOS HuH

Make sure you howl of terror first to pull the entire room for added chaos. We're warlocks, after all. Chaos is what we live for!
---
wait till you see my spelladin outdpsing half of the raid
---
This is a large part of it for me. If classic is successful then it will make companies look at why past just the rose tinted glasses effect was it successful and what can we learn from it? If Classic still has a healthy population in 3 years time then nostalgia can't be the only factor for that and devs will look into it.
---
Typically, if you reserved something, you would pass on everything else in the entire instance. 
---
Unless of course, nobody else wanted it and there was no enchanters in group.
---
ooo good to know, rip power leveling
---
I'm super irked by the fact that Stratholme "Living" is a thing. Back on Earthen Ring EU, Alliance side, we knew it as Strat SS. For Scarlet Side. It's literally all I knew it as until recently. Learning that the majority of servers seem to use "Living" instead, deeply unsettling.
---
The worst that can happen is I still get a day off work to sit around on my ass, guilt-free.
---
Yes, it's part of the reason hardcore PVPers would primarily do WSG. It's just more effective to farm the bonus honor from 3 fast flag caps than it is to see the same faces all day in any other battlegrounds and get 0 honor from the kills.
---
I thought this was r/copypasta at first. But fuck off we're not changing the game for a small amount of people. Even if it is a bit portion of players, no. Just play retail I'd you want that stuff
---
Yeah, on pservers there are no cooldowns on the buffs.
---
I want to play NE but Males are ugly and females make me  feel like a egirl
---
Yea it's a good idea. Eliminates the issue of account sharing for speedleveling/ranking, makes it more difficult to overfarm and thus limits raidlogging.
---
Won't happen but would probably make a better game for the vast majority.
---
Thats just how life works mate either you are at the raid getting the full DKP or you are (correctly so) looking after your child. You can't have both.
---
You're so wrong, you can't possibly believe what you're saying. Get out.
---
&gt; But in practice it's gonna turn into googling "best warrior leveling build"
---
So it's accurate to classic? Awesome.
---
Just trying to help you guys out.  You will never have a wife/ friends or be able to support yourself playing over 8 hours a day of a game.  But it seems like the hardcores don’t care about their lives, so why should we?
---
100% this guy never tanks
---
Oooooohhhh yeaaaahhhh omg we’ve had the table for so long I forgot about that. Oh well, small thing to suffer to feed the party.
---
Disregard *that* input. More parry is nice to procc counterattack. Choose what you want.
---
Personally i would also go with parry if I face a lot of melees.
---
Yeah that’s what got blizzard to actually consider classic, it’s the nost movement that got us classic.. Many retail players have asked for years with nothing from blizzard, your point?
---
Who? What streams? I'm cool with your point if you back it up remotely.
---
Esfand, who started post Nost, and Moo were probably the biggest private server streamers - and they only had 100-300 viewers typically.
---
It would certainly be more difficult, I'll give you that. I just don't think it would be impossible, especially with 1.12 talents and a well-prepped raid.
---
At an extreme you could have a raid comp like 10 arms warriors to spam execute, 10 arcane missile mages, 3 bear tanks, 10 PI priests, 3 prot paladin healers, 2 demon warlocks, 1 hemo rogue - I don't think it would be that much worse than your typical raid comp. People have done crazier things. See: 40 priests kill Onyxia.
---
Your gear set will matter more than your talent spec.
---
With hotw you can tank and heal, as long as you have both sets geared well. It helps that druids don't compete for loot too hard and always are able to fill dungeon groups
---
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
---
This 100%.
---
Classic has been in the works for over 2 years before the announcement of it. It’s release was delayed by Overwatch’s unexpected success.
---
Is sharding at launch for a few weeks before going to layering? Or have I picked that up wrong? If sharding is in it should be smooth to an extent
---
DPS should NEVER have priority on gear that will improve the tank / healer. 
---
Gear tanks / healers first, then DPS. Primary benefit of rolling a support class.
---
You brought up that you can basically do the same in Vanilla (which isn't that comparing "a character with power coming from the end of an expansion before downscaling hits when your 111 to literal noob leveling." even when speaking about a level 55+ from vanilla. 1 button spamming on one elite mob without a care in the world of aggro or death isn't "essentially" the same as Wand+PW:S+Renew while worrying about aggro, which will put a strain on your mana (not an issue in live) and corpse walking and repairs in a game that gold is much harder to come by. To the highly skilled players, they can manage without having to think but you may be forgetting the overall range of skill that is noticeable in vanilla. Live is much more forgiving than vanilla. A lot of players today never experienced Vanilla and will learn the hard way even at 55-60 with gear you need to be weary of your surroundings. From your experiences sure you may be a highly skilled priest in vanilla but it's hardly the case across the board. My apologies if a misunderstood you're point from " I mean, you essentially so the exact same in vanilla, but instead of smite you wand, you PW:S and Renew yourself and wand away."
---
You missed the important part.
---
I really liked PvPing with this spec:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#ce0M0xxoZgVohthx
---
Intimidation is extremely nice to your toolkit.
---
I don't think it's really the schedule that's the barrier to mythic raiding. It's the skill gap. Not everyone can do it. The difference between 50 wipes on a boss and 100 is a few people ruining the raid for everyone else because they can't do the mechanics. And replacing them can be really difficult. 
---
Then there's drama etc and the guild breaks.
---
What then? Go back to heroic? It's easy by comparison.
---
Tell them it's for religious reasons.
---
Try getting 5/5 Learning to use Printscreen
---
So i mostly dont get the time to play during the week and i enjoy a full day on weekends playing wow.
---
Cant call me addicted since i care for myself and its a treat i give myself when i can afford it.
---
Now you see why i dont like your idea?
---
If i play ill play the whole day since wow is a pain in the ass if you dont play for a certain amount of time...
---
.
---
Btw. Hardcore addicts would just open up a second acc..
---
I think they can be both. Each goblin prince has his own ideas
---
Maybe you should watch his video and think for yourself. Look at the definition of a video game exploit, stacking world buffs to trivialize raid content is certainly in that category
---
I donated a few hundred over the years and I know many other people did the same, wouldn't exactly call that "nothing".
---

---
This is the optimal PvP spec
---
1) Increased multishot damage &gt;&gt; agi until you have extremely good gear (T2)
---
2) The chance to have traps not be resisted by 5% is mandatory. Missing a trap usually leads to imminent death. Increased duration/damage on traps is not worth it. Freezing/frost trap lasts plenty of time, and making sure a trap hits is MUCH more important than making it do more damage or last longer. Happy hunting!
---
Dude nice it looks awesome, though come on you gonna be shut in there for more than a week. Jokes aside enjoy it and we will see you in Azeroth!!!
---
Ppl taking the obvious troll bait
---
That's beautiful 😭
---
Druid Tank is actually viable. Especially in the early raids.
---
I was talking more specifically about launch, not a month in. I'm not sure what the server cap at launch will be due to layering. The queue time is most likely just processing people through the login servers when 10k people all try to login at once.
---
I was a noobish dps warrior in Wotlk and I remember the HCs taking being super boring and easy. I remember it would *feel* like 45 minutes then I would look at the time and it turns out we cleared in 15 or less.
---
I also vividly remember soloing the group quests. They weren’t super easy to solo, but they could be soloed on a warrior. 
---
I struggled SO hard to level up to 60, healing up after every mob, then 60-80 was a cakewalk.
---
I'd use that, it seems to kind of distill all the heavy reading the quests made you do and judging by my heavy use of thottbot back in the day this would make it easier than loading up wowhead or something.
---
I wouldn't say best single target healers, a priest at the very least would beat them in a pure HPS race but what they do have is crazy support utility compared to priests, you want to burst the paladin? Bubble, wait 12 seconds please, you want to slow the FC? BoF, good luck. You have a healer helping you? HoJ bitch, can't heal now! Oh look you finally drained my mana and have the FC to 10%? Lay on Lol. That's not even exhaustive either. Their strengths in PvP came from their crazy utility not their throughput (They still had respectable throughput don't get me wrong)
---
This is even more of an argument to remove them from raids. It leads to horrible emergent gameplay
---
WTF is this world coming to?
---
You know there are people in pservers *right now* sitting stealthed near the bridge in Redridge on private servers waiting until people doing that long-ass escort quest are allllllmost there. And then they kill him and everyone escorting him. And they do that all day long. Literally. I tried all day yesterday to get that quest done and every single time we got jumped.
---
Some people don't like that.
---
&gt; In addition to the open world, there will be instanced content available at that level.
---
So we will be able to do DM/RFC/WC and also WSG (assuming we actually get to log in lol)
---
Hell no.
---
That said, I sometimes write down notes in Notepad++ for random ideas I have for some theoretical MMO, and one concept I really liked for an RvR-centric MMO was that the "frontiers" would only be "open" three hours a day. You could run around the frontiers when it was closed but all towers, keeps, and RVR-exclusive dungeons and raids would be "locked" otherwise and be unable to have their ownership changed. This means no midnight relic raids, no 6 hour long battles, no storming the entire frontier with a raid over the course of a day. The frontier had to be won like a campaign and there would be a feeling of making incremental progress in a campaign over a week. 
---
But legitimately preventing people from binging any aspect of a game? Sounds terrible.
---
"This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account in the Americas &amp; Oceania region"
---
Is EU region blacklisted or what? What is the reason to give it to Americas&amp;Oceania but not to the EU? I am a bit salty right now.
---
Fuck no.. A WoW with horde elves and alliance shammys, or flying mounts is one I'll avoid.
---
That cover was released closer to Michael Jackson’s version than to present day.
---
nightelf priest \*stheals\*
---
Then perhaps play the retail instead? Everything have been made easier for those with limited time?
---
It doesnt, since they are optional to get.
---
I decided to finish levelling my orc warrior from 115 to 120 – No problem I thought maybe I’ll experience some new things Horde side.
---
First off I want to say the quests &amp; world art is absolutely phenomenal in BFA, however just about every other aspect is a complete let down.
---
So my final 2 bars of 119 I thought “well I haven’t experienced much content with other players Horde side so let’s tank some dungeons.”
---
What occurred after was a warlock justifying pulling bosses by saying he’s soul stoned, a AFK healer that either had net issues or was alt tabbing 90% of the run.
---
The first sign of a wipe = people leaving. The first sign of adversity on a boss = blaming other players Oh but the first sign of loot usable by someone in the group? Completely silent coms when asking if they need the gear.
---
What I experienced was a complete shit show of a game, there’s no RBG, there’s no MMO, there’s no player interaction anymore, I sincerely hope classic is such a success it makes Blizzard realise what a real game is, instead of the casino cash shop we have now.
---
Personal accountability? What's that?
---
Unless you’re a frost mage specc’d in improved blizzard- the melee mobs will never make it to you ;)
---
But if you pull any ranger/casters then RIP
---
This would depend on the guides I am going to use. Since I don't plan on creating my own guides but use existing ones instead, the translation optimally should be done by the guide creators.
---
Translating the addon itself would not be a big deal then.
---
If you happen to know any guides that are available in your language feel free to post a link.
---
People about to find out why layering is important
---
Don't let your memes be dreams
---
PVE servers exist.
---
OP you are really fucking stupid. I don’t think you even watched the video, you just read the title and started rambling
---
Pretty much every point you say was refuted in this video, and the video pretty clearly shows that world buffs are, by definition, an exploit
---
But sure, you can also just be stupid and shout NOCHANGES without even thinking about what people are saying
---
Winfury whiners disagree.
---
I can't get the info until after 7:00pm central. My work lets me use Reddit but, not much else.

The general sentiment toward “classic” versions of a lot of games has been changing, Activion is just riding the nostalgia train with the rest of them all the way to the bank. Do you really think they care about Nostalrius or anything else besides money? The second it was obvious it might be profitable they jumped at the opportunity.
---
Theres one in the thread now that you can talk to.

Great advice, thanks. 
---
Would an alt with Herb/Alchemy be a solid idea? A mage/hunter, perhaps?
---
I leveled Pala, Mage (my main and true love), Warlock, and Druid during vanilla and TBC.
---
I never finished warrior though (left it at lvl 58 because I didn't understand the class at the time). 
---
So I guess I'll do a warrior all over again.
---
The mind control/renew trick is something I used to use a lot on my Tauren friend in Goldshire, I got a lot of hate for it, but it was hilarious watching him wreck face.
---
Priest is a lot of fun for little things like that.
---
Incoming complaints:
---
“Oh so now I have to pay to play in the test environment?”
---
“The beta streamers got higher levels this is bs”
---
Add your own! Join in the fun!
---
I got a staples chair for $80 and it's holding up well after almost 2 years. Nothing wrong with it yet. It has a few adjustments too and lumbar support. It has height, arm height, seat tilt, and seat back tilt (reclining).
---
This looks like a really good setup though. People show off their battlestations with crazy lights and minimal keyboard with no wires, but imo there's nothing better than being right next to an open window with a view of plants outside during the transition period from summer to fall. The cool fall breeze with a blanket over your legs while you play wow is just a very comfy feeling.
---
Move to California they have you covered.
---
They already made your game....It's called retail WoW.
---
&gt; As it stood, naxx gear was viable until t4 replacement or further in many cases.
---
Is this really so problematic though? Also it's not so bad to jump ilvl a bit for an expansion to encourage an initial reset. The issue is jumping it too much during the expansion such that the spread between opening day and closing day is utterly huge. It completely invalidates all previous raid tiers and content, and sets you up one of two scenarios: either many classes are performing incorrectly at one end of the spectrum, or you have to restrict class mechanics so much that gear becomes uninteresting. For example if ilvl is increasing by 100 over an expansion, a class dependent on crits is going to either be hilariously bad at the start, or hilariously good at the end...or you change the class to not really be dependent on crits, but end up with no real character progression other than bigger numbers.
---
&gt;BoD mythic came out jan 29 2019.
---
The key word here is Mythic. It's a direction of the game that started in WotLK which has hugely cheapened the feeling of Blizzard's raids.
---
Seeing a new wing of a raid for the first time and killing the next boss used to be unbelievably epic experiences in this game.
---
We've traded that for a game where the base level raids are cleared by decent guilds on literally the first night they're released...and then the only race is to see who can re-clear it on the highest difficulty level.
---
I never even got to see KilJaeden in Sunwell or anything past Four Horsemen in Naxx 1.0. My guilds took weeks upon weeks to get through MC, BWL, AQ40, Naxx, SSC, Black Temple, etc. Each new room I got to see felt so rewarding, and each new boss we pulled had me feeling nervous and fully knowing it might be another couple weeks before we actually kill it.
---
In modern WoW it still takes my guild weeks upon weeks to get through Mythic, the difficulty is crazy high, but there's nothing terribly special about it aside from the actual feat of a new kill. I've already seen this entire raid two dozen times on Normal and Heroic. I've already killed every single boss two dozen times on Normal and Heroic. I'm not making "progression" in this zone in an RPG sense of the word...I'm only increasing my score.
---
At some point the devs decided that $15/mo buys everyone the right to kill every single boss in the game. Unfortunately making it that easy has completely cheapened the thrill and feeling of immersion that raiding used to have.
---
"Thanks to your stupid threads and arguments I will have way less time for my kids, just remember that. YOU are responsible for this not me."
---
Go play something else.  If this is your outlook on life you're a shitty father.

&gt; We’ll have our next stress test for WoW Classic on
---
June 19, 2019 3:00 PM . This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account in the Americas &amp; Oceania region. For players who have not yet tested World of Warcraft Classic, the game will become available for download late tomorrow, June 18.    
---
&gt; For this stress test, all races and classes will be available for creation, and the maximum character level will be capped at 15. In addition to the open world, there will be instanced content available at that level. This will include Warsong Gulch for PvP as well as Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns, and Deadmines. Of course, Deadmines will be a challenge for players to complete at this level.    
---
&gt; Please focus as much play as possible during the first three hours of the stress test. During this time, we’ll be looking for more issues to address under initial launch conditions. The stress test realm will remain available for 48 hours.
---
&gt; If you encounter any issues during the test, please let us know by using the in-game bug reporting tool. If there is anything you’d like to discuss further, feel free to post here in the Classic Discussion forum.    
---
&gt; Thank you very much!
---
They got exposure and who knows what else from when they got invited by blizz for a discussion. At the very least they got what they asked for, blizz opening classic realms
---
I played a 60 warrior and had a 19 twink hunter just to mix it up once in a while.
---
Classic is most likely going to lose 50% or more of its initial player-base within the first few months. It's a niche game that most people won't enjoy long-term. I don't get the cognitive dissonance that occurs on this sub where people criticize "casuals" for causing 
---
Blizzard to make retail the way it is, but also thinking those casuals from retail are going to switch over to Classic in droves and prop up the population.
---
More nanny state bullshit
---
Streamers make bank playing that much
---
They definitely never planned it from the start. The reason they had to redo the classic world for cata was because of flying. If they just allowed you to fly, you would notice all the little workarounds and everything they did to stitch together some areas. It's the reason you still can't fly in the ghostlands and azuremyst/bloodmyst isles.
---
i think the servers will explode, and or waiting queue's for 3hours+  
---
With that in mind, everything will be beter then expected :D
---
I can enjoy a day off work whether Classic is available or not.
---
EU is better than the US in a lot of other things like football, comedy, drinking. Let us have something please ;(
---
the company is based in california so it can get better data on people connecting to their stress test servers in LA.
---
thx god, now all offline - normal beta server will up soon!
---
Confirmation email didn't come when I tried to make my account :(
---
No EU? Nice job Blizzard.
---
This is an excellent answer, thank you very much. Having it on the talent calc is an unexpected 2-for-1 also.
---
Homogenization was very prevalent as far back as wrath, but it spiked in MoP big time with the new talent system. So if anything MoP is when it got very bad. 
---
The way the trees were designed was okay tier 2 is mobility, tier 3 is defensive, etc. so naturally every class became self sufficient and very similar in capabilities to one another.
---
I steal them ALL! HA!
---
Yeah I watched the whole video. He did say that, and then he used examples of things that are only true on pservers (that wasn't true on vanilla) to bolster his argument as to why Classic should be changed. Its complete bullshit.
---
Blue pvp set, winterspring frostsaber, and eventually full netherwind! Also the two spell power trinkets (toep and zg one).
---
&gt; It feels dead. Also it's such a mishmash of content from so many expansions.
---
Also picked it up again (Wrath was the last expansion I put serious time into) and it feels like I'm playing a museum of an MMO. Going through all the raids and catching up with the lore is nice, but I couldn't see myself sticking with retail long term.
---
Don't forget enh is a tank spec turned dps through incompetence in vanilla
---
&gt; You will never have a wife/ friends or be able to support yourself playing over 16 hours a day of a game 
---
Some people are not interested in getting married, or making friends outside the many they will have from playing 8+h a day. Seems more like you think their lives are bad if they don't fit your cookie cutter mold.
---
If you have 5 children then at least 1 of them should be old enough to farm for you.
---
when the best player in a guild leaves they usually take a friend or two with them. often this player is also raid leader or the main strategist. in this case the guild falls apart because there is no one left that can replace them.
---
with classic i think this will be less of an issue since you only have to clear a raid once and not worry about heroic/mythic and new content being shoved out every few months but at the same time it is certainly more demanding to have to farm mats for consumables
---
&gt;I'm arguing that they weren't "smaller upgrades", because the system was fundamentally different.
---
Explain please. Because I don't know what you mean.
---
SJW here to save you from yourself.
---
Cool to have so many players in the same layer.
---
This. Horde are meant to be more aboriginal like, almost like pagans whereas the alliance is based off of high fantasy and more western ideas of society and beauty. Multiple things happened in tbc that killed the divide between factions..in classic it could really say something about beliefs and values or psychology by what factions got picked. That's because they represented two opposing worlds
---
Which I could say the same for the parts where they use the cheap 3D scenes.
---
Yeah you are really fucking dumb OP
---
Imagine in sports if steroids were legal and they just said “you don’t have to use steroids it’s optional”
---
That is fucking bullshit, anyone who wants to be competitive is forced to use steroids. The exact same logic applies to world buffs
---
**(H)&lt;TRASH&gt;, (Horde. PvP Server)** is looking to bolster it's ranks ahead of classic launching late this summer!
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are a core group of friends with a diverse background in terms of where we have spent most of our time in WoW. From high level arena players to level 19 twinkers... between us we have seen almost every aspect of the game at some point. We are looking for more social, active and like-minded people to join the guilds discord ahead of launch so we can begin to develop a plan to achieve as a World PvP/Premade guild as well as raiding together in a relaxed atmosphere.
---
All the details of the guild can be found [here](https://trashguild.com/). Not every little thing such as scheduling/raid times are set out yet due to it being so early... but if the description of the guild sounds appealing to you then feel free to shoot an  application my way!

Many thanks for taking the time to read.

Lmao no one of this sub forced you to have five kids
---
They look great. Wailing caverns looks like it’s for Indiana Jones.
---
&gt;“Just don’t get it”, doesn’t work as a counter argument, you don’t understand how basic competiton works if you think you can just “not get the world buffs”
---
I do, and if you want to compete then you go that extra mile to get all the buffs.
---
Clever use of game mechanics, no one thought of them as exploits when vanilla was current, so why would they be considered exploits now?
---
It's more difficult to monetize pserver activity. People who take the game very seriously often prefer to make some money off their investment of time.
---
I logged in for a few dungeons, for the first time in a long time my groups were actually talking... about how they were excited about classic WoW. Even trade chat was bringing it up nearly constantly.
---
No eu wtf:(
---
0%
---
Why does this copypasta keep popping up?
---
Shaman. Totems plus a fair bit of down ranking.
---
I wanted to play Druid, but I think the lack of regular res is going to make me play Paladin instead. Planning to heal mostly so it's a pretty big annoyance to not have a no-CD res
---
Oh I pulled 2 Murlocs who spam frostbolt, guess I'll lay here and die...
---
Awesome, just what I wanted thank you for the help
---
&gt; Imagine in sports if steroids were legal and they just said “you don’t have to use steroids it’s optional”
---
You mean like body building?
---
I still use that from time to time but generally try not to. They're a different type of gamer and have as much right to want their stuff as I do wanting mine. 
---
I don't wanna be like the assholes telling me that I don't really want classic and that it's all just nostalgia blabla. If the "Wrath Babies" liked Wrath, fine. Good for them. It's just a shame that for them to get their game I had to lose mine.
---
No it’s not. This is about you. You are likely a casual player worried about competing which is a ridiculous notion in a PvE game anyway. You don’t really care about someone’s health. At least be honest.
---
1 out of a million
---
Cmangos or an open source private server would have the DB you're looking for. I have one installed in a local client but to be honest I don't find it all that helpful. At least compared to something like the classicdb website. The schema isn't very friendly to human eyes and the queries I wrote were more complicated than writing request urls that did the same thing.
---
I have horror stories of groups inviting locks just for the summons and kicking them immediately afterward. While it's rare, it's still something you have to worry about when people always expect you to put in ~15-20 in travel to save their lazy asses.
---
&gt;I have 5 fcking kids to feed you think i want to walk to stratholme all the way from IF every single time? you think I even have time to do pointless stuff like that just to play this fcking game? 
---
Whose choice was it to be irrisponsible with thier own biology by haveing more than 2 kids to replace themselves as parents?
---
Have run this with 4 priests and a warrior before just for the quest. You would think it would be slow but surprisingly it went super smooth.
---
"ANYONE" all caps. Except for us in the EU as it says in the article. Did you really need to bait us for no reason?
---
I might be mistaken, but isn't the distance between US and Oceania bigger than between US and EU?
---
Damn - looks like Melderon's trigger-bait worked. You got triggered and are giving him free views.
---
World buffs will be like they were in Vanilla. That won't change.
---
Millions doing what, playing a game?  You can't meaningfully compare the number of people who signed a petition with the number of people that play a game.  In terms of petitions 250k is a huge number, especially considering the topic was not political.
---
Ahh it's the random stat ones it's missing, such as [https://classicdb.ch/?item=10504](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10504).
---
never said I was remotely interested in it.
---
it's people on this sub who are somehow under the illusion that classic will bring back tons of social interaction while doing dungeons... and all the evidence point against it.
---
How have they not been a catalyst? There was very little momentum before the private server explosion and now there is tremendous momentum. What do you think the word means?
---
Congratulations you're an idiot.
---
.Classic is most likely going to lose 50% or more of its initial player-base within the first few months. 
---
I'm sure you have some great data to back that up. I guess we'll see.
---
- “And got nothing In returnere.” Well some of Them got a job at blizzard...
---
This could easily be fixed by a weekly allotment of time.  But regardless there comes a point where too much time in game is unhealthy, period.
---
I've been playing magic arena or whatever it's called to fill the void since I had to put down the BFA as a matter of principle.
---
It's like hearthstone but better, and it's way easier to get your dailies done without all the best cards in the world, and you can build up a few tier 1 decks pretty fast if that's your thing.  
---
I give it a 8/10 overall, and best online card game for sure.
---
It ain't much, but it's better than nothing, and it's free to get started...even though it'll most likely get you to put a couple quarters in the slot eventually.
---
yeah seriously im a lock main and only have played a little mage but id much rather go out and grind mobs than just cast a conjure spell over n over. i never got the whole oooo limited bag space and oh you have to kill mobs like youve been doing since you were level 1. but i love my lock and people love their mages i understand it. im js almost every class has limited bag space what with armor sets/ammo/poisens/reagents/profs its just how you handle it.
---
Lol. The only situation where 5/5 increased parry is in any way justifiable is when dueling a melee class, but that’s it. Increased damage by 3% and crits by 3% is a no brainer.
---
It is about me,  but it’s also about reality. Spending 16 hour in game is objectively unhealthy for a human being, period
---

You truly have to be a literal moron if you think

1. This would ever happen 
---
2. This is actually a good idea
---
3. This would be considered acceptable outside of Communist China or North Korea where the oppressive governments literally make decisions on how their people live.
---
Unfortunately for you, Blizzard is an American company where freedom is held in high esteem.  People excel at what they focus on.  If somebody determines that to be WoW, who are you (or Blizzard) to tell them it’s the wrong choice?  For some people (see streamers) this is an extremely lucrative choice that allows them to reap tremendous financial rewards.  Again, who the fuck do you think you are to tell them how they should be living and what they should be doing for a living?  
---
Get the fuck out of here with this bull shit.
---
&gt;World buffs will be like they were in Vanilla. That won't change.
---
tell me something i did't realise literally the second I clicked the button.
---
Yes. And of course it always happens when your AoE taunt is on CD, so you don't have a backup.
---
i should do this lol but its a mere reflection comrade
---
You will not find a warm reception here for this crediting. For whatever reason the anti-private server circlejerk is quite common among the many people more recently interested in WoW Classic.
---
It really displays portraying things changes peoples perception of it.
---
When they implemented it there was normal and exhausted and people hated it, then they changed it to rested and normal and people loved it.
---
While you're a bad person and should feel embarassed for making this post it *would* be cool to have more server options available: 
---
Why not have a few servers with four or eight hour caps in a calendar day? 
---
Faction-balanced within 52-48% one way or the other.
---
RP-PVP. 
---
Non-layering and no sharding.
---
Different population caps. 
---
They could let people
---
pls explain im about to spend 200 my lower back hurts like shit and im only 21
---
most guilds won't be able to get them most of the time, so what's the issue?
---
Ah yes the "I want to bring wow down to 1fps from 15fps" circa 2006
---
On wrath private servers Naxx is buffed significantly because it’s way too easy, and face rolling content is just not fun. I think we’re going to run into this problem with Classic though, unfortunately.
---
Nothing.
---
You can't win them all, especially against retards like that.
---
Why do people keep saying this?  It's not really true.
---
I guarantee you his wife's boyfriend did. The BF is probably a #nochanges boi too.
---
I would love them to add world PvP goals that build rep with your own factions and race, and you get armor specific to your race AND class for it. Kind of like high warlord if say tauren warriors got some sick looking chieftain gear, or  a troll shaman looking like a decked out witchdoctor
---
5 children? You mean 5 resource farmers!
---
You are aware the people are responsible for their own actions? So sick of these nanny state people.
---
TBC was peak WoW for me because people WANTED me to Druid tank raids, Druid healers were great for both PvP and PvE, Balance Druid was a fucking war machine walking and cat form didn't need a low level hammer to compete.           
---
           
---
They could rename The Burning Crusade - The Hybrid Crusade and it would make perfect sense. Also Karazhan is the best raid ever.
---
Distance from Los Angeles to Perth, AUS: 9930 Miles
---
Distance from Los Angeles to United Kingdom: 5160 Miles.
---
Who didn’t play private servers and pushed for classic? Maybe Asmon is the only person I can think of. Be grateful.
---
There definitely are areas in classic wow where you're going to have to NEED to let the tank pull + wait a couple of seconds before joining in, just so you don't pull aggro.
---
That's phasing not sharding. Phasing is when you are further along in a story of a zone so the scenery of the zone changed. If people weren't as progressed as you then they haven't seen the story change the zone yet so they were in a different phase of the story.
---
Sharding is the same as "channels" in other MMOs. You are lumped in with a set amount of players in each zone, but not necessarily all the players in that zone for server stability.
---
I don't like it either, but Blizzard had to decide to either keep it like it was (which players endlessly complained about because they couldn't stay online or the game was laggy) or they implement sharding (which players endlessly complain about because it kills server identity). I prefer no sharding, but I don't think many people remember just how bad the servers were at peak hours. The server stability complaints outweighed the other complaints at the time and here we are now.
---
If I'm killed twice by the same guy I'm logging another character to her to play. That's why I have 8 alts
---
What about eu people who already took part in previous tests? The launcher came back up for me the other day..
---
So many people taking the bait.
---
Don't give things away for free when you are good at it! Especially with classic being so big soon. (I'm a Dev also)
---
I'm retired, and my genetics aren't worth passing on, and I hate being around people.
---
Go play Retail.
---
They're drinking the cool-aid
---
The random South Shore Wars and STV arena brawls will be a thing still for sure. World bosses will be a big deal even late into the final phase. 
---
I think RPPVP servers (if we get them. Come on blizzard give us a blue post already) will have lots of events going on. Weddings, parties, World PVP Hunting Squads, Social Tavern Events etc... 
---
I also think dueling tournaments will be a big thing. 
---
The lack of being told what to do will creating more random player driven content. 
---
“Completing” Classic will take years for the average player. Naxx will take casual guilds a long time to get to let alone clear. Even if you got full BiS on one character you still have the option of alts. Or starting fresh on a low pop server. 
---
I can see Classic providing content for me and my crew for the next 6 years easy. If we ever get to BiS for everyone and do everything everyone wants to do on Alliance we can always roll fresh on a horde server and do it all again.
---
Tell us more
---
I used to play a mage and would Always offer a portal at the end of a dungeon. Might just be me but i think everyone should do all they can
---
I remember this. 
---
I also remember there being a "rested" and "well-rested" state.

NA PvE or PvP Alliance 7 PM PST Weekday Raid Times and anytime on weekends  
---
Hunter looking for a guild that raids 7PM PST on the weekdays and anytime on weekends. I'm not too concerned about being in a server first guild, but I want to complete all available content. I really don't care either way if I'm on a PvE or PvP server. All of my raid experience is from TBC and WotLK.
---
"boohoo, now I can't gank them PVE'ers just trying to enjoy PVE anymore", not even complaining, just whining.
---
I started on a PvE server and have regretted since I first touched a PvP server, I still regret it. I would likly have been a much better player to this day, and have had much more fun. &gt;.&gt;
---
like office depot/office max or whatever generic store there is near me? this will work? theres a microcenter i buy all my electronics and pc parts from and when you buy their plan you bring in the item and get it replaced with a new one or if that model isnt made anymore the new equivalent
---
That, and DPS.  You'd be crazy to take lower DPS for a spot if you have higher DPS available, unless you need the class for something specific.
---
anyone with an active subrscription will be able to play the stress tests (next one is this wednsday)  
---
and theres a higher chance of getting beta invites if you have an active subsription as well iirc, so GL! ;)
---
System of a Down, specifically the album Toxicity, played that on repeat while I helped my friend grind out High Warlord. 
---
A decade later, I can’t hear Prison Song without picturing Warsong Gulch.
---
Well technically I had sub for a chance of beta just at the time the beta started and my subscription ended this weekend. So they waited just enough to make people subscribe for another month if they want to do this stress test.    
---
But it was a EU subscription anyway so good thing I did not buy several months at once to be jebaited like this.  (Also I am in the USA atm so I am region agnostic).
---
Ret was pretty awesome in vanilla PvP until the very end before BC.
---
Bubble, Hammer of Justice, and heals were very strong, in a 1v1 you were unkillable if you were doing it right unless you were up against mana drain.
---
Obviously dm isn't in the beta, but there are some spots that you can use the same method and it works just fine. Mobs are obeying pathing rules, so I think it will be the same.
---
I encountered this problem as well, accidentally closed the wrong tab. Figured maybe I'd get somewhere with the "Forgot password" link but it doesn't appear to be working right, just sends me back to the home page. This was true in both Chrome and Edge  
---
Tried firing it up in IE, page wouldn't even load.
---
SJW?
---
After I cap my main and establish a good source of income, I'm going to go for a full BiS 19 rogue twink. Mostly for the satisfaction of having a full geared twink to jump onto every now and then when I'm bored or otherwise just waiting like the few hours leading up to raid time.
---
Knowing Joana his shit is not going to be free
---
Can confirm additional invites rolled out for this stress test as one of my friends just got it. None of us had gametime the last couple of weeks.
---
WoW I actually remember that.
---
I'm a way better father than you will ever be
---
Where did you get that information? Need to know

you have a girlfriend? lol fucking amateur go roll paladin

---
No it's more like, first athlete to win the championship, gets prize money.
---
It helps them prepare for next round of competition, but no lasting effects.
---
Next round, new winner is awarded the prize.
---
Sucks to be you.
---
While there may be less top-tier players I doubt the average skill level is much lower, if at all. 
---
As for why there's less top-tier players, for a start off anyone wanting to make a career out of playing instantly can rule out private servers as you can't stream them on twitch and there's no sponsorships available. The player pool is also smaller and there's less prestige involved.
---
For PvE specifically the highest achievement is world first, so obviously for the highly competitive it makes sense to play the version of the game that consistently has new chances to achieve that. (raid encounters also seem to be the one part of the game remaining that is almost universally agreed upon as consistently high quality)
---
For PvP in vanilla specifically there's no arena which is what most competitive people gravitate towards, the player pool is also smaller. While I can't think of any off the top of my head it's not uncommon to hear of higher ranked players playing on private servers over the years either.
---
You mean all the new players and re rolls? Blood elves were filled with people I never seen before on the horde or heard of their mains...everyone I know up and left after tbc..wrath latest.
---
I see what you're saying, but i dont plan on dropping group the first sight of something I don't like.
---
Thank you, from work.
---
And who exactly are you to tell anybody else how to live?  Pretty sure Sodapoppin’ and Asmongold are pretty happy with their decision to play WoW in excess of 8 hours a day.  Guarantee they’re doing better than you are.
---
seriously i just moved into this place june 1st and ive always had my pc in a basement with low light and no plants this makes my set up 1000x better for me. wont feel like im crawling out of a cave when i stop playing wow for 10hrs or however long or short tbh
---
Yeah, I had to keep warning my friends the first time they were on a PvP server. They had super PvE tunnel vison

Feral Druid - Gear envy. I never get to visually enjoy my gear upgrades. Stuck looking at the same bear/cat butt all the time.
---
For real.
---
Everyone deals with it. When you hit 60 you can make it your job to help lowbies finish that quest by camping those stealthies until their Rez timers are capped. 
---
I rather deal with horde killing my escort while leveling than being level 60 sitting in stormwind twiddling my thumbs because there’s nothing to do but farm and raid.
---
I think a lot of us were disappointed when we saw what the release date was and how far it was since it was Summer 2019 but basically at the end of it. But I'd say it's definitely worth being this far away as long as it's polished and finished instead of rushed and bugged.

Oh that actually made me feel better about it, thanks for the info. anything I need to do to be able to play the stress test? iv not played a wow beta/test for a very long time so not even sure where i need to be checking for access.
---
Hunter - the lack of good looking gear at end game.
---
I'll probably get roasted for this, but I think forums like /classicwow should institute a cap of daily stupid threads at 8 per day. Both for the health of the average hardcore redditor and the ability of the casual to compete. People who spend 16 hours a day in a forum shitposting are going to have an enormous advantage at the detriment to almost every other aspect of life, but they will do it because they are “addicted”
---
Guys if you're EU and want to play this you an always make a US account. Not ideal but that's an option for you
---
Calling gamers with Kids lazy seems like an uninformed opinion, I work twice as hard for literally any thing I do, then before I had kids.  I however, do not agree with  participation awards for those who participate late. Life gets in the way, but their are consequences. Why should your guildies be asked to suffer any more then they are just for dealing with an inconsistent player.
---
A lot more horde players quit for tbc whereas a lot of alliance loved it and stuck around to wrath.. on my server. The horde was bitter af once tbc was going strong and people disappeared

**&lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt; NA // PVP // ALIANCE // Casual Raiding**
---
Raid times: **Alternating Tuesday and Monday nights @ 6:30 PDT** (To be clear – this means ONE night per week)
---
The main thing to note about &lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt; is the raid schedule. The initial group is comprised of people that played classic together many moons ago, most of whom are too old to play like we used to, but are also powerless against pull of nostalgia. As such, in order to keep our wives happy we'll be raiding one night per week. To begin with we will alternate between Tuesday to Monday nights. This way we can run the same raid timer twice without playing twice per week.
---
Because of the limited frequency of our raids I expect us to run MC/Ony exclusively for longer than your average multi-night raiding guild. A subset of the guild is welcome to start attempting new content as it releases, but my primary concern is getting MC on farm. Once we come to a consensus that MC has little left to offer, we will shift to BWL, and so on. Members will obviously be free to pursue other raid timers during the weeks where we return to a raid on Monday before the reset. Once Molten Core is on farm (which I don't expect to take terribly long) we will raid every Tuesday instead, using each reset.
---
DKP for the loot system. Pretty basic, blind bid, 10% decay every week, the specifics aren't nailed down yet but DKP isn't particularly complicated.
---
The tentative date of our first Onyxia, and hopefully subsequent Molten Core attempt, is October 8th 2019. I realize that giving only six weeks to level is counter to the whole casual appeal of this guild, if a member needs more time than that it's not a problem. Many of us, myself included, are going to attack leveling with an unhealthy zeal that will only be able to last so long before divorce becomes imminent. Our first run may include a few level 58 healers, it may include a few PUGs, these things should not be a source of stress. We are not going for any records, the most important thing to start with is to get in there and start teaching the fights.
---
One note on the casual nature of this guild: it doesn't mean I'm looking for lazy raiders. We are casual due to frequency, that doesn't mean you don't have to know your class / at least make an effort on consumables. Molten Core is not particularly difficult, but I would like to get to Ragnaros as quickly as possible. In order to do this we will need to remain focused during the raids. That said, we're pretty easy going.
---
On that same note, I would like to run this with as close to 40 active raiders as possible. Seeing as we'll only be raiding once per week – my hope is that the majority of members will be at every raid. Life is never so straight forward, so I will be recruiting some alternates, but for the most part I'd like to keep the roster tight.
---
We're all very excited, this should be a lot of fun. Here's hoping some of you join us in the Molten Core and beyond.
---
PM me if you're interested. I will start an email list and keep everyone updated. Because our schedule is so simple, I see no need to make a website, if our members want one I will make one.
---
Right now we can take any class, if you're unsure of your class at least give me what you're considering. Druid is the only class I'm almost full on, I can probably only take one more. If you need help deciding, I am a fountain of classic knowledge. Most notably I still need a main tank – who will be the one raider who gets loot preference. As such this position is going to require a little more vetting, if you're interested in being main tank make sure to note it in your PM.
---
Thanks for reading! See you in Azeroth.
---
Yeah, I'm wondering this too. I had access to the first 2 stress tests, hopefully that is still a criteria to let people in.
---
unsub and wait 2 months
---
Communist.
---
if the group wants to come with me they can, and im not dropping group at the first sight of something that I don't like.
---
Cool, that was my thought as well.
---
I plan on running tri-spec to heal in pvp so I can still take advantage of blackout procs.

My kids aren't that important to me. I've been waiting so long for this game, I just want to be able to play it in peace
---
Have to
---
I mean I get what you're saying and you're very apparently not the only person who liked MoP class design, but saying that class homogenization started after MoP is just plain wrong. It slowly started with TBC and was pretty present in WotlK. They took a step back and re-evaluated for MoP for sure, but just because the classes were fun to play doesn't mean they weren't homogenized. 
---
Player Buffs, Bloodlust and all the stuff I listed earlier were HUGE steps towards making classes less unique. 
---
WotlK had class homogenization as a proper stated goal. "Bring the player, not the class" emerged during WotlK. I find it a little absurd to state that Homogenization started 3 expansions later.

Is that why cocaine is illegal?

Just know that if I ever see Jvlevs11 in game you'll be politely whispered for a portal to UC, if accepted you'll be given a rune and 1g. You're a lifesaver and I don't want you to think otherwise.
---
Would use.
---
It's perfect, like just an overlay with the info I need.
---
Yah but all those leveling alts will love me.
---
world buffs are a crutch, if your guild can't do it without them, your guild can't do them.

---
Nuh-uh!
---
So your assumption is that everyone who played a blood elf was an alliance reroll? Do you have any proof for this?
---
1) I wouldn't twink to crush under-geared lowbies, I would twink to fight other twinks
---
2) Paying 50g to respec from your raiding spec to pvp for 2 days feels bad. Not every class can pvp as easily in their raid spec.
---
3) In later stages of the game, gear imbalance at 60 becomes basically the same issue as twink vs non-twink. The difference is the twink gear doesn't require constant raid farming and progression to be relevant.
---
4) Twinking gives a unique playstyle that otherwise doesn't exist in pvp. For example, shield spike, redoubt, lifestealing paladin serves a strong 1v1 option, while just swapping a couple pieces and a 55 healing weapon allows you to be a clutch healer and support. A couple other pieces and you can FC. This variability doesn't exist at 60.
---
5) WSG is an entirely different battleground without mounts as a flag carrier. Wall jumps and jukes are so much more valuable, and the communty's ability to do these specialized jumps make the game very engaging.

You're hallucinating. I never said that. Life is easier when you don't take things personally.
---
You can farm some gold and buy game time.  Its one sub so you can get classic game time for retail gold.
---
I put PvP on once and left in on for my first toon about 30ish to 60 in vanilla, got attacked once in Tenaris, by a friend down the street from me, and once in un'goro...
---
That or how it’s unfair for not given advanced enough notice that anyone could play because they are On vacation this week. Or how unfair it is because people with jobs will have limited play time as it is during the week.
---
I played og dota but I never really paid much attention to the fact that they were pandas. I just saw them as storm spirit and brewmaster. I don’t think pandas ever resonated with most people as a part of the warcraft universe.
---
I mean... with  nothing new happening how do you hope to have anything but repost and rehashing the same topics over and over?
---
What were these farmed for?
---
I did PvE server in actual Vanilla, leveling was always disappointing to me, I would look at a member of the horde, realize they had no PvP enabled, and felt sad.  
---
On Nostalrius I was PvP obviously, holy shit was it fun, I played Warrior, so had to put up with severe fingerings on an hourly basis while trying to level. But the adrenaline rush, and ability to turn around, you cant beat that, the feeling of finally having your mate by your side. I actually made a list from 30-60 of every player that griefed me, I then proceeded to hunt them down after reaching Rank10 and having MC gear, I scratched off half of my list and made a nice little screenshot archive off the back of it.
---
When people only want me in their PvP premade to stay in cheetah form and flag carry :(
---
It's almost like they're a support class and not a DPS class...
---
He talked about it a bit in another comment, though I'm not clear if it's only partially working : https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1ncso/sixty_upgrades_a_new_website_to_help_you_plan/erebg1r
---
If you're placing totems for every pack you're not positioning yourself properly. Only exception to this is 5 man dungeons where you have to be aware of patrols and usually close quarter pulling.
---
The BETA lengths don't reflect what they will be on live, people aren't farming ranks.
---
its 3 points
---
Getting to experience the shit show that a launch like this can be is it's own fun. Even if it's bad, it will get better pretty quick as people give up on trying to login. I was in for Vanilla launch, and I will be in for Classic launch.
---
Remember to play alliance if you want to see the fun bullshit happen when Omar summons a ton of shit.
---
I'm sorry i thought this was America
---
This is great work OP! Thank you.
---
erm, I used my gold to sub this time, I did it early because of over hype lol did you read my OP ?
---
but yeah gona farm more gold during this month I guess nothing else I can do .
---
Yeah, this screenshot would’ve been a lot better if there were a bunch of neon haired babies riding shaking mechanical chickens.

For the Alliance!

Just be the FC everyone needs, you might not be as mobile as a feral but you can still rock it.
---
i thought the same! but the sun is never directly shining through the window and it doesnt cause a glare which i dont understand but i can always draw the blinds if it is a problem. my eyes just like having the 2nd monitor to the right it naturally goes that way for me
---
Why wont you do one on a freaking weekend...
---
This quest is only available for horde correct?
---
&gt; They're different games, get over it. 
---
Why would I need to get over it? Wtf? 
---
&gt;basically, you don't like progression.
---
WHAT? 
---
&gt;So you would like to go straight to naxx when you hit 60? ok...
---
Hard to take you serious if that is what you're taking from my post.

I buy Razor naga mice from best buy and get the protection plan on them.  I like them, but I always break them before 2 years is up, they are kind of chinsey, but I also abuse the fuck out of the mouse wheel when I pvp.  I take it in and they give me a new one, and I pay $11.00 for another 2 year protection plan.
---
I just enjoy playing Prot Paladin so I can watch Rogues kill themselves on my shield
---
Probably, added stress from being a dad
---
it is a spam copy. please report
---
Yeah I figured lol still funny tho
---
Filthy casual... JK play how you want. I can’t imagine playing in a PVE server myself though. Takes so much of the random danger out of the game. Puts PVP rivalries into BGs alone. 
---
I wanna see the guild I don’t like as my guild rolls by and have it be on like donkey Kong. “Let’s get em boys! Red means dead!”
---
On my old server most people who played blood elves were new players that we have never heard of on horde. I was on a server where I at least knew of every horde player.
---
First of all, you are an idiot, just wanted to get that out of the way.
---
Second, you are mega idiot.
---
And thirdly, your a grand majestic supreme idiot.
---
But thank's for your suggestions! In the future, please write down any ideas you have on a paper and shove it up your ass. Thanks!
---
Does anyone know if there is a site where I can preview the model animations? Like trolls caster motions or night elf melee animations?
---
Sounds like something a commie would say.
---
Than what the fuck you call someone who puts as much effort into doing something as possible?
---
Using engineering and consumables in PvP is a good thing and makes you far more powerful than people who aren't doing it and it is a tryhard thing to do. 
---
Having all world buffs and every possible consumable for a raid is tryhard and it's a good thing, because you benefit your group by being a lot stronger.
---
Yeah. I honestly feel like it was more impactful than the loss of unique classes for the factions. This is just conjecture, but I feel like the Horde would still feel like the Horde if instead of Blood Elves, we got Zandalari Trolls with the ability to be Paladins. And the Alliance could get Elves of some variety and give Dwarves the Shaman class.
---
Killing low level enemy players is a great method of inciting world PvP. The only “problem” is that you have to be a “bad” person to really get it to work, killing 1 lowbie won’t do much, but slaughtering all of Redridge will have the Alliance 60s coming out of Ironforge to try (and fail) to defend their younglings.
---
Corpse camping lowbies is really just adding insult to injury though, it can yield a similar outcome, but most likely you’re just being a piece of shit to someone who can’t do anything about it, which is more of a reflection of someone’s garbage personality then anything.
---
This is exactly why #nochanges exists. People without a clue, like you, think they understand what is good and bad about the game. If you don't like the game, don't play it.
---
Those on pvp servers dont want the opportunity to get attacked first.  They want to do the attacking for maximum odds in their favor and indiscriminate of level.
---
You never see pvp videos from vanilla of players getting attacked first.  It's always them with the upper hand.  Hell hunters in the 40 range can take on groups of 3 if they get to engage first.  Blow up cloth, trap the melee, kill other player, then the trapped player.  Its 3 1v1 battles, not true 3v1.
---
Once you have some nice gear to support it, if you come to heal my UBRS as shadow and you're in level 40 greens I'm gonna cry and ree at you.
---
Yeah that's what I normally do but being a warrior sometimes you just wanna smash some face with a 2 hander.
---
The hype is absolutely there. I cant do much against it, browsing this sub daily.
---
I actually am looking an old DVD for the 5th time right now which contains boss kill videos of my old guild in TBC.
---
Still not vanilla but many people of the guild played with me in vanilla.
---
An old ingame friend sent it to me by mail (yeah real life mail) back then. I kept it until today.
---
Man nostalgia is hittin hard.
---
No savage strikes... ew!
---
You’re missing the point... he’s not saying that gamers with kids are lazy... he’s saying that incentivizing everyone to start on time with a dkp boost is beneficial to the raid’s success, because some people are lazy. If you’ve got kids and responsibilities, I’m 100% sure any reasonable guild will make accommodations if you hope on discord and say “running a bit late, had to x”
---
i honestly hope im shut in for longer but the side quests are the biggest pain. you have to grind for hours doing the college degree reputation and then theres the pain in the ass daily quests like eating, cleaning, and making time for the gf.
---
Ya the bear looks cool but mechanically boars are better then bears and they get the charge power.

Mage where is mah water ?????
---
Had the same experience, I haven't played WoW since TBC release (played for awhile before realizing that flying and resilience was going to kill world pvp and went on to other games). I was afraid that it might just be nostalgia or all the hype but I found a server and the love is absolutely there. If anything I'm more excited than ever to play classic.
---
Yeah as a prot good luck
---
woo!  finally time for me... sry EUers, maybe the 3rd stress test is for u?
---
very true
---
Europe is definitely way better than America in terms of employment laws and strong unions, but capitalism has nothing to do with those. It's unions that won workers' rights through organization, strikes, and protests, and they did that despite capitalism, not because of it. I'd love to see a system, any system, with no corruption and all powers held accountable by the public, with totally democratic workplaces etc etc. But that definitely wouldn't be capitalism, and it wouldn't be the USSR either.
---
Some apps like TSM have a free and a premium version. Just saying.
---
Ahh so now we are defending steroids lmao

I used to do cocaine in my free time, and im still addicted, playing wow is way better then doing cocaine.

---
You are still holding hostage the group to your whim, while at the same time taking issues with the tank for doing the same thing (with 1 person impacted though, not 4).
---
You are not more "right" than the tank, you are simply willing (and able) to increase the stakes even more. That, still, does not make you right.
---
I feel like 2 days to get to level 15 (in the middle of the week) is too short and I'd be surprised if I got max level.
---
Ah well, I'll be there anyway lol
---
huh nice might have to check it out

I keep hearing about this 'VC' instance so I think you missed one

---
Does vanish replace the tank you just lost?
---
still mileage does not change the options in the region settings in the battle.net launcher.  they have servers setting up for the NA &amp; oceania region because that is the home region for blizzard.  the patch they put on the NA &amp; oceania servers for the stress test means they don't have to deploy the hardware or patches to get a whole second region set up before they are ready to test deploy to other regions.
---
The ethical way to put down livestock is to do it as quickly as possible, and that's what I'll do.
---
That's a pretty fair reservation but I hope Blizz is going to do their best to try and force as close to parity as they can come launch, just by keeping the number of servers as low as they can.
---
Just a tip, you could have saved some work by using/based your implementation on TourGuide. It's more minimalistic, but provides the same functionality.
---
This is why people like you are stupid, you just say #NOCHANGES without even thinking.  Why arent you arguing for Reck bombing to be in the game?
---
Nostalrius and JonTron were really when attention boomed on the private scene. Without them, I don't think we'd be where we are today.
---
Just pay attention to cast time, if it flies out while they are moving or instantly after a real shadow bolt you know for sure.
---
Man, that´s gotta be awesome.
---
I can't understand why classic enthusiasts would be butthurt about private servers. They gave the people what they wanted, even though Daddy Blizzard said no. They didn't hurt precious retailers.
---
Maybe we should only have 12 hours out of the day to walk or 6 hours to drink...
---
There are limits on games and they're called mobile games and parental controls.
---
Play the game and be worse than people with more time - or don't play the game at all and we all win.
---
Yes, I do it at OfficeMax. I buy the ~$500 Serta with a $7.99 protection plan (it's a 3rd party company, the store is not involved), wait a few months, make a claim, get a check for $500, buy a new chair, then sell the old chair on Craigslist for ~$100. Pays for your WoW subscription and keeps your ass in a new chair the entire year. Staples will work too, but their protection plans are more expensive.
---
"clever use of game mechanics" is the lingo players use to justify an exploit lmao.  Also this was an issue that was addressed early on in BC so blizzard definitely viewed it as something that wasn't intended aka an exploit
---
This is getting out of hand! Now there are two of them.
---
I can actually get behind something like this. Nice idea man.
---
&gt; classic enthusiasts
---
I have to believe atleast the majority of the people we are talking about were never around for vanilla. If I had to guess, these are most likely retail players that are dissatisfied with BFA and on some level view Classic as the next xpack that provides new content for them... however flawed that might be.
---
Nice, build, might try it out, it's something I was looking for
---
Not accurate.  
---
It used to be that players who didn't have rested experience were considered "exhausted", and the x1 leveling rate was framed as being a penalty. Players didn't like feeling penalized, so **Blizzard kept the exact same system and exact same XP rates**, but reframed the difference as a "gain" instead of a "loss." Instead of being "exhausted" because you're not leveling at 200%, you're "rested" when you are. **All they did was flip the name.**
---
If you think that everyone is going to go back to the way things were in vanilla and private server metas will have no effect you are delusional
---
I'd rather see the complaints than some annoying smartass.
---
But that might just be me.
---
Then you get there and every turtle within 100 miles is dead.
---
3% crit and 3% dmg for 3 pts isn't great?  WTF are you smoking?
---
Why tho?  You can get +50 agi with lightning reflexes.

Found an example of someone who posts on reddit without even watching the video

Anyone bar the EU.

It’s funny seeing you hopelessly addicted hard-core gamers defend your right to play 16 Plus hours a day. I’m trying to help you but continue to run your life it’s all good
---
That sounds decent I agree
---
That quest is, yeah. I have no idea if Alliance get an equivalent trinket ; I never played Alliance. Yuck.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Can the admins ban this obvious wannabe troll already?
---
"this company is trying to make money!"
---
welcome to capitalism, my sweet idiot
---
Union members all make more money than non-union counterparts, even after union dues (which pay for things like a lawyer to sue your company with if tmey screw you). The reason is, alone, you're only one person, and you're disposable, so the company can tell you to kick rocks if you want higher pay -- you just can't negotiate against a company by yourself. But you have WAY more leverage as a big group of people than as one person, so you can negotiate higher pay and actually get it. They can't afford to lose a lot of their workforce at once, so you strong-arm them into taking your deal.
---
Get out of here you buffoon! What kind of a child needs an 3lectronic mommy to tell them when they played too long? Seriously people like you are ruining the world with your need for a nanny.
---
It's weird, isn't it? I wonder if it is simply a factor of budget. Hollywood has the same problem. Modern special effects standard is fucking incredible imo, yet the writing is totally hit-or-miss.
---
Blizzard has parental controls in account management. They have had them the whole time the game has been out. If you don’t trust yourself have someone you do trust set up your parental controls to limit your time. Ez pz.
---
Personally I would just nut up, be an adult and manage your own damn self.
---
This is genuinely one of the most blind and biased comments I've seen on this sub. 
---
&gt;You will be SURPRISED at how many BfA players are prepared to leave it, for good, but they don't say it out loud, to avoid being flamed, or begged not to kill the guild, or other stupid reasons. The impact of Classic on BfA will be larger than the impact of Cataclysm on Azeroth. You just have no idea. 
---
&gt;There are probably 10 times more BfA players hiding their intent to play Classic over BfA, than those that openly admit it.
---
You're just pulling this out of your ass. No one is scared of talking about a videogame they want to play... No one hiding their true feelings for fear of some kind of criticism or retribution. This is a fantasy that you're inventing.
---
&gt; Except top mythic guilds in BfA (which are maybe like 5-6% of the player base) every other guild will find itself without enough people for raiding...and not only on August 27th, but for a very long time. Long enough to create a snowball effect of migration from BfA to Classic...because the social aspect of Classic will be TOO POWERFUL to ignore.
---
&gt;I am really sorry for BfA players. I really am. But they, along Blizzard, are to blame for the state of WoW. This is what you people want, and Blizzard delivered.
---
So the people who didn't like how WoW was and wanted more QoL features and more content systems, which you blame for the state of retail... are also all going to abandon retail to play the game they wanted changed in the 1st place? Read what you're saying dude, it makes no sense.
---
&gt;I understand your HOPES that BfA won't have any problems, and "both games can coexist"... but this is a fantasy. Yes, both games will coexist...but one will be a desert town, while the other a booming, thriving world. 
---
Again, this is just fantasy. The most likely scenario is that Classics population falls off after a few months, and most retail players go back to retail or other games. Classic will co-exist as a niche game with a small stable player-base, while everyone else dips in and out of during content lulls in retail.
---
&gt;"People will play Classic for 2 weeks and realize that it was crap and will quit". No. Most people won't. Because they will also remember WHY they spent 10hrs/day playing Vanilla back in 2005, and why they are spending 20 minutes now playing BfA. The game is just TOO GOOD. For all the ganking, and struggling with gold, and farming...there is 10 times more reasons to STAY in Classic than LEAVE.
---
For one, most people who still have interest in WoW didn't originally play classic to begin with. WoW has had well over 100 million unique accounts, Vanilla had around 7 mil subs at peak and most of those players are older now and moved on a long time ago. The large majority of people who have an interest in WoW have never touched Vanilla.
---
Also, you can tout the social aspect all you want, but at the end of the day people need interesting things to do. And Vanilla runs out of those pretty quickly for the average player once you're 60. And most people won't want to deal with the slow grind to begin with.
---
Personally, I feel the same way you do, retail is a mess(though there's still fun to be had), and it will be nice to relive old-school WoW on an official server. I know what I'm getting into and I know I'll enjoy it for what it is. I also know it's not some flawless game with endless replayability, and that you're average WoW player won't have the stomach for it.
---
If your doing this you should pick streams with the least viewers to spread out the people , the big names don't need the extra views but the new people could benefit massively from it.
---
the starter bundle in arena is an insane value. it is pretty easy to go optimal and get a draft per week from completing your 750g quests and 4 wins per day grind.
---
You have so many things going for this pic, from the Sabbath silkscreen to the Chat Noir duo... Not sure why you would want to replace the chair with the proverbial contented kitty marks on the top of it's back though ;\^) Your little familiar will need to redecorate the new one in much the same manner before it's truly comfortable.

No you arent arguing for Reck bombing, because thats an exploit.  Stacking world buffs to trivialize content is an exploit in the same exact way.  Or you can just /facepalm because I have actually presented an argument and you have no actual argument
---
I mean its talking about BfA in relation to classic, so your entire argument is kind of moot.
---
No thanks I'd rather not inflate some dbag streamers numbers.
---
Sorry but as someone that played back in the day in a server heavy with dual wielding warriors, I beg to differ. I made four warriors back in Vanilla and two of them were dual wielding. It definitely is viable and can top DPS charts if geared properly, especially with today's knowledge of back then.
---
But then again, you're talking to someone who used to also main a PvP melee hunter with specialized gear, so thread carefully 😂.
---
&lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
What to expect
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
We often hang out and socialise while we wait for classic launch. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server for us to jump on, test some things and have some fun every now and then.
---
We are currently accepting raid leader applications!
---
Raid dates: Thursday &amp; Tuesday
---
Raid times: 7:50 PM GMT

I always expect people to make their way to the instance, and then start summoning people as we arrive. I always say this when I end up with a warlock in my group.

As is tradition

If you can slap a hooker, you can slap a chop.

Idk I love mine. I got the large size and it’s comfy as fuck.

Hunter - Deadzone. It's really easy to abuse if you play a Mage.
---
The cats in badlands are pretty good and they drop greys that sell really well. I want to say it's like 6s or 12s each. They add up pretty fast. You can find them in the 36-42 level range so it makes a nice spot to farm when you're almost but not quite level 40.
---
Nope.  My first character was on a PvP server (Lightning's Blade), and then after a while I rerolled to a PvE server (Turalyon).  While there are some fun interactions that can happen on a PvP server, rerolling to PvE and no longer giving players of the opposite faction the ability to control how and where I was going to play the game was quite liberating.
---
If you close the page with the prompt for the verification code, how do you get back to it to verify your account?
---
I don't think you realize how little damage that is. If it was 3% crit chance i would agree, but its crit damage. Aimed shot is gonna be your primary attack so instead of doing 1000 damage it will do 1030 or if its a 2000 crit it will do 2120. Yeah, its trash. And this is your most damaging ability, the rest of your abilities will more often than not see a single digit damage increase.
---
Shut up 7 day old account. Stop posting your garbage. Do not like classic wow, do not play but SHUT THE FUCK UP about it. Nobody wants your negative bullshit. Suck my block, troll.
---
I decide they fate on the spot then and there...
---
I like to have fun with lowbies and just hit them once or twice and then stop and see how they react haha
---
&gt;at the detriment to almost every other aspect of life
---
Who are you to determine what is detrimental to someone else's life? I regularly game 4 or 5 hours most nights. Yet I still cook dinner every night, spend time with my family before they go to bed, and take care of my house. 
---
&gt;the ability of the casual to compete. 
---
If you're a casual gamer you will never "compete" with someone who decides to invest more time and energy into the game. That is there choice. If you want to compete then step up your game, don't demand they do less.
---
If someone decides to play more than you obviously they will be further along/better than you. If someone works harder or studies more you don't see others complaint they are working too hard or studying too much do you? 
---
People really need to just worry about themselves and let others do what they want.
---
Fortnite will still exist on the 26/27th so no way will it break a million concurrent (not that their numbers are accurate anyway)
---
But I'm not being sarcastic when I say - on 8/26 I'll be watching numerous streamers quest while I try and log in for an hour or 2.
---
&gt;f you’re playing less than **10h** per day
---
FTFY- lol
---
That is scary!
---
On live, I expect 30 min matches of rushes.  If it goes more than a hour and no were close to being done, I'd /AFK and take the debuff to reque and hope I get a quick one.
---
Blizz doesn't do much on weekends, because most of them don't work then. They kinda have to have all hands on deck for this stuff

You might really like the book [Mutual Aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution) by Peter Kropotkin.
---
Open world pvp is for you then - it's going to be cross realm bgs so probably won't get a sense of who's who until several months after launch.
---
Then i grind the cats up in the mountains. Those are pretty easy to grind and have decently good drops lol.
---
**Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution**
---
Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution is a 1902 essay collection by Russian naturalist and anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin. The essays, initially published in the English periodical The Nineteenth Century between 1890 and 1896, explore the role of mutually-beneficial cooperation and reciprocity (or "mutual aid") in the animal kingdom and human societies both past and present. It is an argument against theories of social Darwinism that emphasize competition and survival of the fittest, and against the romantic depictions by writers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who thought that cooperation was motivated by universal love. Instead Kropotkin argues that mutual aid has pragmatic advantages for the survival of human and animal communities and, along with the conscience, has been promoted through natural selection.
---
I didn’t have an issue on D3 release. Didn’t have one on legion release, or BfA release either.
---
Not really worried about it being a bad launch. Besides what could be worse than Vanilla launch?

I love leveling, farming, minding my own business. What I don't like is getting ambushed and camped for the next hour while doing any of the things I love. I played on pvp servers from day 1 to the day they removed pvp servers and now I am going pve cause I just don't have the same time or energy to deal with this.

Master builder’s shirt or GTFO

Literally 1 job and OP fails
---
Its not 3% crit. Its 3% crit damage. To quote myself
---
&gt;Aimed shot is gonna be your primary attack so instead of doing 1000 damage it will do 1030 or if its a 2000 crit it will do 2120. Yeah, its trash. And this is your most damaging ability, the rest of your abilities will more often than not see a single digit damage increase.
---
But Oceanic players typically play on NA servers so that makes sense.
---
Thats the main point keeping me away from warlock. I dont want to spend my playtime fighting slackers in the chat. Its vanilla, we all would love to keep questing and finish that last one thats just one or two mobs left, but you need to understand that in order to do an instance, you have to run.
---
I know ill have to argue with slackers and entitled people in every single party. You will always be the bitch and do not dare to say a word. "Just summon him so we can start for once", and then the slacker gets what he wanted, learnt nothing and will try the same the next time.
---
That's not true at all.  I recently unsubbed because I didn't get into beta (I know, it was a long shot) and they asked for feedback.
---
QoL changes will and have already been made. 3 that I can think of right off the top of my head are the modern mailing system, modern macro system, and the “turning in quest items and being able to get rewards” issue that this thread is about.
---
&gt;This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account
---
Oof, gonna be crowded. Time to test my plans for congested launch.

Look into Brave browser, you can receive tips from users in a crypto currency called BAT (Basic Attention Token) by becoming a content creator on their platform. You don’t need to display ads or anything, it’s just opening up a potential stream of revenue for you. Brave is based on chromium so it works just like Chrome, but it’s not by Google and blocks websites from tracking you :)
---
I wasn't trying to say it started with MoP. Just that, in my opinion, it didn't get bad until WoD
---
I think there is a balance, and that a certain amount of homogenization is probably necessary just for sustainability of the game. Things like class buffs and stuff like that really shouldn't be homogenized, non-shaman classes having bloodlust is beyond stupid, but interrupts and cc are probably two areas where a little is necessary. 
---
It's definitely a complex issue, more complex than I think a lot of people are willing to admit.
---
This is my only account you fucking idiot.
---
Keep crying, those tears are tasty 😋
---
World buffs are here to stay and theres nothing you can do about it 😄 As long as there is people that are fine with how world buffs are working, Blizzard arent going to change a damn thing 😉

If you're an herbalist the ogres and yeti in the alterac ruins are good to farm and you can gather some wintersbite while you're there. Should sell well on the AH and if you also have alchemy then you can combine it with khadgar's whiskers to make frost oil.

Also, everybody loves the Admiral's Hat.

If something happens, I'll use the days off to do other stuff around the house while I wait.  
---
I have the days to use, we went on a family vacation and the kids will be in school - no different to using them and not playing or using them and playing.
---
Not really. Most of the raid content can be done with 25 people while the other 15 just fall asleep at their keyboard.

Yea I had to stop wsg doesn’t matter how many times you yell at people to stop fighting in the middle of the map, they’re like “durrr but I see ally there so I go there that’s how you win idiot kill ally lawlz”
---
I am happy it's 48 hours this time
---
Really? Why would you remove quality content but leave up the 50th post thanking Pserver teams or the 900th person to make some crappy item DB for classic wow.
---
&gt; I keep my eye on the back line to throw a fear on any rogue who thinks he is clever. 
---
Warlocks are amazing AV support, the ability to be strong defensively while also being able to just pop up to offence and dot everyone to then just return to defensive tactics while waiting on mana/health.

Your lack of substance is only surpassed by your excessive amount of emotion.

Just hang out in wetlands on a rogue and kill all the lowbies corpse dragging to the boat to get to darnassus for the training.

Looks really peaceful. I'd bet sitting near that radiator on a cold winter's day with the snow falling outside is cozy.

Since everybody is giving you unsoliceted advice I'll join in:
---
Staple Hyken is a good chair. I'm on my third year and it still looks and feels new. They go on sale for $100ish once in a while. 
---
If you're looking for a long-term and high-quality option look on Craigslist for used Herman Miller and Aeron chairs. Those should go ~$350ish and people. 
---
Also have you considered monitor mounts? $20-50 and clear up a bunch of space.
---
If you're world pvping are you honestly shadowmelding and waiting for someone to pass by? Dwarf is objectively better.
---
It is a ways down to that basement but it is great for immersion.
---
Why are people so salty about a stresstest? I'm from EU and I don't mind, it's literally testing. Just wait 70 days and have fun then.
---
No, they tell you that more money is made in a union.  The stats point otherwise.  As an individual you are responsible for your progress through a caterer.  Not a infograph on tenure in workholding.  Unions cater to those who under achieve and expect the same as those who over achieve.  I was there, there is no upside and no future compared to the progress and income an individual can achieve beyond the union.  Take the blinders off and actually evaluate the usage of what they supposedly promise you.  I will never work union again and will never pay someone dues to tell me I'm worth less than someone else because they had been there longer, despite my outproducing them at nearly 3x the speed with fewer defects per capita.  
---
You hold your future and career, no other person does but yourself.  To assume you need protection of any sort means you do not believe you can succeed in your own.  Little else.
---
Good.
---
Am I the only one a little turned on right now....
---
They arent forced to, but to be the best of the best they have to do that little extra.
---
If you want to raid for fun, dont get the world buffs.
---
If you want to try hard, get the buffs.
---
I don't are about Fortnite. I didn't even mentioned. This is about Classic and Activision-Blizzard.
---
Not about other game.
---
K1 was a lot less over-tuned than Nostalrius and it’s derivatives, and a lot of people complained that it was too easy. So I think the private server community has been spoiled by higher difficulty in both dungeons and raids. 
---
The people on this thread who really enjoyed T7 naxx will probably be happy with the difficulty but I think pserver players and others who like a bit of challenge will be underwhelmed. 
---
A lot of people have brought up speed-running as a potential challenge, but I think it will be a niche thing.
---
No thanks. I don't care at all if the world pays attention to Classic WoW. I just want to play it.
---
my ban is Blizzard, he will dad u
---
Oh they took a lot of money for ingame adventages no worries.
---
Imagine thinking imp conc is better than efficiency.
---
And then going down into the crypt to summon demons and bind them. And poisoning a noble who was figuring out what you were doing down there.
---
I totally agree
---
They were breaking the law...
---
It's undoubtedly a conspiracy.
---
That's not a 'try-hard' though.
---
Genius from Blizzard: Tell players that having an active WoW subscription will make them eligible for an invite to the beta, receive thousands of resubscriptions from players desperate to test and play WoW Classic. When invite waves stop and players realize they're not going to get in the beta and thus unsubscribe, make the stress test available to everyone to ensure those desperate to play sub for another month. With the requirement of having to have an active WoW sub for the minute chance of getting in the beta, and the reserving of names two weeks before launch (ensuring at the very least most people will be subbed for 2 months) Blizzard are doing a good job of nickel-and-diming people's enthusiasm for Classic.
---
Talents.
---
Even with cross realm Bg’s, can’t wait!
---
Why do people have to pay money to participate in a stress test? That goes against the very nature of a stress test.
---
It is a bit disappointing that Blizzard took the greedy route
---
Depends on the race.
---
Just flag yourself for PvP all the time and watch everyone double-take when they see you before trying to sneak up behind you. 
---
I had great fun escaping from folks as a Druid.
---
Anecdotal evidence. Classic is about community, its amazing how much more people will engage when engaged with, a large amount of the playerbase wants it so it will likely happen.
---
I have a few pictures of the early open beta in 2014. Most of the pictures are me running from Stitches.
---
How about all of us on retail, myself included
---
The tank doesn't even have to be replaced, if you've already started the instance just clear it 4man without a traditional tank class. The hunter / pet / rogue / shaman will do just fine.
---
Keen to try this but not receiving the verification email :(  
---
Using Gmail if that's relevant.
---
I actually like the fact that there aint going to be that many hunters in raid. Easier to gear up and I have always made really good relationships with my fellow hunters and I believe it is mainly because there has always been the long lasting core of four hunters.
---
2:27 anus pincher
---
Excellent question for the record, when I wrote my first comment I remembered there was a way to game the system to get a quasi premade but if you hadn't called me out I wouldn't have remembered specifically how it was done
---
Obviously it's just a prediction, but I think it's the most likely scenario. I'm not saying Classic can't snowball into some huge phenomenon, but I don't think it's likely.
---
And losing half the player base isn't as bad as it sounds. The population is going to be way over-represented for the 1st month or two just because pretty much everyone with an active account, or who has any interest in WoW still, is going to try it out.
---
There might be 4+ million people playing Classic over that 1st month, but how many of them do you think will keep playing? Or even hit 60?  And don't get me wrong, Classic can lose half its player base and still be successful, it doesn't need millions of players.
---
Dude, throw up some ads to cover your costs/make a tiny penny.  No one cares if you get money for your effort if we're not paying directly and you're not selling our info from registering.  If that doesn't cover your costs/even if it does, feel free to also accept donations on top.
---
Got to give it to ya, pretty cringe seeing you try so hard. 
---
This gets posted everyday guys, pack it up.
---
&gt; proved by the fact that this was an issue fixed in an early BC patch
---
Because those buffs didn't get weaker as the player got to a higher level (except for Fengus' Ferocity but that was grouped in with the other DM buffs). Doing vanilla content for a buff in TBC content goes against their TBC design philosophy.
---
Snowflakes don't know how to self-regulate though. It's always someone else's fault or they need someone else to tell them what is good or bad. People really don't know how to manage themselves anymore.
---
Believing you are more important than others doesn't make it true
---
Wow from what I know about WW1 and how horrid the trench warfare was, this guy must have been certifiable.
---
In America, land of the free.. I’m able to choose how I spend my free time. If I have 16 hours to play, survive on twinkies and Mountain Dew, I will use every second of those 16 hours to play or until my eyes bleed. If you can’t play for 16 hours a day then too bad. No one should be restricted because YOU can’t play longer than 8 hours.
---
Respect for suggesting such a ridiculous idea amongst the ravenous wolf pack (r/classicwow).
---
Good news. But I'll skip this thanks. I let my sub lapse today and I'll be back on August 12th (my time).
---
On top of that sometimes I see the rogues on their mounts trotting up to the front line before popping into stealth - love the panic on their face when my dots take them out of the stealth right as they try to get by our raid
---
Well, its part of the experience.
---
Just play a private server till launch?
---
i'm not going to sub until august, that will be $15 wasted if I sub now
---
Funny timing as anyone who bought a month for a chance at getting a beta invite will have run out of time by now.
---
Hi not going to sub until august, that will be $15 wasted if i sub now, I'm dad.
---
Dont hamstring my DPS numbers!! Gotta rock and roll all day long!!!
---
But OP said: 
---
&gt;I don't speak about any exceptions of players who are great.
---
So clearly he doesn't mean the exception players? or what?
---
I usually don't kill lower levels, although I might throw a cc on them or something for the lols.
---
Each region has its own server (only natural for a game with a large RVR component to reduce latency). West Coast, East Coast, EU, Asia. Each region has its gameplay window optimized towards its "prime time".
---
You probably didn't need to call OP _fucking stupid_ that's just gonna make everyone downvote you immediately.
---
Unfortunately, you're arguing with people who've never had to deal with the toxicity that comes along with World Buffs. They've never dealt with the whiny top DPS that ninja logs for the night after he pulls aggro and loses his buffs. They've never dealt with an entire raid that's bugged in combat, refusing to jump into the lava because of their world buffs. We just want to play the fucking game, and world buffs directly inhibit that.
---
Sure, it's fucking awesome to get that extra power, but they are definitely going to turn into a crutch for a lot of people, and it won't be obvious until it's already happening.
---
All that being said I'm still in the #NOCHANGES boat because this project alone is about preservation, it's not a new game releasing. If we ever get some sort of Classic+ and the devs have gone down that slippery slope, then yes, remove the fuck out of them they are nothing but toxicity.
---
They didn't get sued into the ground
---
Well that's true aswell lol
---
With the way it’s worded in your first comment, 
---
“Participation awards for participating late” 
---
Is where I’d disagree with you. I don’t think anyone is advocating to reward players late or to not have set rules. I’ve raid led 20 people, but not 40 people in mythic Uldir and favoritism / elitisim / egos / etc is always a factor. The last half of your current comment 
---
“You set the rules, raiders agree, no fuss no muss. Missing out on “on time bonuses’ is fine. Players will still get gear, just maybe not the moment it drops.”
---
is exactly where I thought myself and the other commenters where at with our comments.
---
biting the hand that feeds them. what a bunch of worms those people are.
---
Shows how little your guild died* 
---
More attention = more players = motivation for Blizzard to start planning Classic+
---

---
Have some faith. You'll be happier for it.
---
OP is talking about the sense of community within one match of AV. He could never see any of those players again for his entire WoW career and his experience would still be valid.
---
His build is terrible, but any pvp build that skills efficiency is equally terrible.
---
There is no place for feelings in real pvp. Ganking noob is a totally legit hobby
---
I think that was WotLK. Brainfreeze procs for FFB which nuked.
---
Warrior is probably one of the most basic, least mechanically intense classes in classic for sure.
---
We did RFC at level 10 last stress test, its not like something was stopping us back then either
---
Oh that humanoid ran away and I missed on that last attack? Guess it's coming back with two of his friends to murder me.
---

keep an eye out for people constantly shit talking pservers if you want to know who the first people to call for changes to Classic like transmog and LFR will be.
---
Good idea.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all classes should be.

really grasping for straws there huh

Or is the healer escorting You?
---
Looking for Guild - The more information you can provide upfront prior to exchanging discord info, the better.
---
NA / Adult guild preferred / Horde preferred / PvP Preferred / Evening raid times / DKP / 2-3 nights / No later than 11:30 CST end time.
---
Looking for guild that will be emphasizing both PvE &amp; PvE elements. I will be pushing for max level as quickly as possible, and would be looking to participate in both raiding and premades as quickly as is feasible. Between the two, I place a slight heavier emphasis on PvE and would want to be with a guild intending to clear all raid content. I would however like to run with folks who are serious about attaining at least rank 10/11 in PvP, as well.
---
I've been playing off and on since 12/31/2004. I've raided as Dps, Tank and Heals through the majority of raid tiers since release. DPS from MC-&gt;Naxx in Vanilla, and throughout TBC. Tanked from WotLK through mid-Legion. Healed 2nd half of Legion. And in BFA I played Dps till I stopped playing.
---
I have acted as a Guild Leader, Raid Leader, Class Lead, General officer and lastly rank and file, and am comfortable in any role. If I'm an officer, I take that seriously. If I'm rank and file raider, I show up and shut up. Whatever is needed/required.
---
Classes I am currently considering are:
---
Mage - Most likely
---
Warlock - Possibly
---
Hunter - least likely for Dps
---
Ele/Resto Shaman - If guild is more pvp focused. Unlikely.
---
Enhancement Shaman - If guild is heavily pvp focused. And wants to gift me a Hand of Ragnaros. #noshame. Highly unlikely.
---
After my main is leveled, I intend to level 1-2 other characters. One such alt will be a prot warrior.
---
Please DM here on reddit if you think your guild and I are a good fit for each other. We can then exchange discord names afterwards.
---
Launch day metrics aren't going to matter for the long-term viability of WoW Classic.
---
And I don't even want Classic+.
---
This. Once people are honor farming, both sides will be full of players who want 11-minute rush games.  
---
And I'll be there, turtling my best to make sure those games last at least an hour.
---
Sorry to bust your bubble... classic wow ain't breaking streaming records.
---
Slipknot, System of a down, Sum 41, Linkin park, Paramore, Disturbed.
---
as far as i'm aware you get armor aswell, that's useful against every melee, and you just stomp rogues.
---
Shadowmeld really isn't useful in pvp unless you're camping and even then i'd argue it's just better to run around and engage from 41yds which is really easy to do. No reason to camp around.
---
I thought it was 30/0/21 for instant cast. While also being able to heal raids just fine. (Like a \~5% difference)
---
more game time is only an early advantage, and advantage for avid rerollers.
---
Eventually just playing a character you really enjoy so that you can stick it out long term, means that you will get all the fat loots, and get all the levels, and get all the monies.
---
Big whoopie some guy was able to no-life it and be raid ready in 1 real life game week.  Guess that he's doing now.. Helping guildies level and gear up.  Farming Money to buy crap your selling? 
---
If you want to nerf the game down to a level playing field, I think you'd be happier in retail.
---
Pvp got boring for me after so many mobas and shooter games over the years.  Yeah, winning 1v2 or being part of a huge townraid is adrenaline pumping at the time, that dopamine rush pails in comparison to working with your guildies and working on group objectives over the span of a year.  Killing other players just doesnt excite me as much as seeing a new recruit get 6/8 tier or leveling alts for guild crafting purposes.  The great thing about vanilla is that there are many different ways to interact with the world and community. those that disparage others for enjoying things the way they do... well, its just immature.
---
Force layeri changes a small number of areas, egglayer change NPC in major cities and at start areas only.
---
You wot?
---
FAP only works if you're lucky with your Blind.
---
1. Cheap Shot/Ambush
---
2. Blink
---
3. Polymorph OR Blind.   
---
4. **(1)** Polymorph runs its course FAP over, and wasted    
---
**(2)** Blind hits and you carry on as usual.   
---
**(2.1)** Mage Ice Blocks for the remaining duration of FAP and just see (1).
---
Warrior becomes tougher for sure, the blink will be negated by the intercept, and the mage is boned.   
---
Now Blink has a 20s CD so the mage will get away, but the warrior may counter with a Charge now that he's out of combat, unless the mage puts him in combat before blinking.   
---
Even so, I'd say a good mage will easily handle a warrior, simply because the warrior doesn't have enough skills to blow whereas the mage does.
---
All 3 mage specs have talents that passively reduce threat by 30-40%
---
I'm only even interested in classic because I miss having buffing totems. Swapping classes is not an option.
---
They're just dumbed down versions of systems from legion. 
---
People shat all over the legendary and artifact system for its rng and grind so Blizzard simplified it with the necklace. 
---
Then they took away tier sets to help out the artists designing sets for each class and difficulty. 
---
So then they made azerite gear to try and tie in the whole necklace power and give you agency over new powers you could unlock since losing tier set bonuses and legion artifacts felt bad
---
Cheers !
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
I feel like its really not that hard to find another DPS.
---
I made a twink becuase obtaining the BiS was a lot more casual then getting BiS at 60. Once I got to a point at 60 where I could only get upgrades by raiding I made a 39 twink for something to do while I was waiting for raid times. The most fun leveling everything to make sure when I hit 39 I was stacked then just jump in once in a while to have some fun against other twinks. But it was always fun one shot ambushing mages and warlocks at 39.
---
I am getting vanilla wow flashbacks already.
---
Ok, everyone give me your log in credentials and I’ll limit everyone’s playtime. You’ll get to play in 1 hour bits every third hour.
---
&gt;Do you guys remember when TBC was announced and we all fell in love with the idea of flying?
---
Not to be a cynical hipster dbag here, but I always thought flying would hurt the game.  The biggest issue, of course, is the more time you are in the air, the less you're in the ground.  The ground is where you want people to be since that's where all the content is, where pvp takes place, etc.
---
To answer your question, I would not introduce it as a main part of the game under any circumstances.  Maybe I'd allow it in a few instances?  That would be about it.
---
Raid as a Ret Paladin and get full t2 and Sulfuras.
---
Lol all those men fought and died for your right to be a loser.  What a joke
---
It’s almost like the support they provide doesn’t make up for the dps loss they cost...
---
Let's be real here, if you're desperate to complete classic and spend an hour farming every possible consumable/buff whilst in a guild with Casualjon and Dozydaisy you're not really setting yourself up for breakneck progression and should probably change guilds. People's vibes will attract their tribes, if the guild you're in are super focused on progression and you're there to just get through the content at a reasonable pace, you're in the wrong guild and you'll only cause yourself stress by staying there.
---
And how are we going to do that when we can't know what factors op rates how?
---
I regret nothing!
---
The problem with paladin tanking in 5-mans is that it takes longer because the dps needs to hold back. You can do it, but few people want to, and it's not a lot of fun. At least having a 2H warrior or shadow priest tank is entertaining.
---
Paladins do a lot better in undead strat and scholomance, but that's a pretty limited niche.
---
In addition to this, There are some items that are valued a lot higher just because of the Hit chance. for all dps specs, hit cap is a must. Once you're hit capped though, the stat is essentially useless. Is there a way for you to incorporate something where it knows when you're at hit cap and then can filter around that?
---
69 for those of us in the U.S.  (ಠ‿ಠ)
---
Lol k, I didn’t even say that so good job pulling that comment outta your @ss. 
---
Kind of easy to see the private server, the petition, the meeting with blizzard was the whole thing that got them to consider classic. 
---
But hey, you keep living in your box.
---
Yes but dont forget how much time it will take to lvl and gear that alts so it can farm efficiently
---
There was nothing like doing the STV fishing tourney on your level 19 twink.
---
Gnolls have always used ghoul death sounds
---
You said you didn't enjoy norm/heroic/mythic progression (When it's really mostly just Heroic -&gt; Mythic, normal gear always sucks and is worse than very simple M+ Gear) 
---
I get different instances are more engaging, but you realise when classic is released, it will essentially be raid whatever content is newest, because it's all INCREDIBLY trivial?
---
neither will twitch viewnumbers tbh.. blizzard knows the sub count, they know the traffic, they don't need us to watch twitch streams to see people play it.
---
SHHHHHH DON'T TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE FROST OILS!
---
Instead of planning for failure, why not just bring another dps and try to avoid fuckups?
---
Is SS vs TM a thing is most Pservers within the first few months? I never played on pservers past 30 for my leveling path. From what majority of this sub seems to say, everyone here is a min-maxer and everyone who isn't a min-maxer won't be max level until at the earliest October, so I'd expect said min-maxers to be focusing more so on dungeons for pre-bis and alt leveling for farming. 
---
Also I'm going to ignore the RP server just because the whole point of the server is to roleplay, so I'd consider them an outlier. 
---
Do you think the life cycle of Classic will actually last years? I'd suspect either more Fresh Blizzard servers, or progression to BC well before the 2 year mark. I personally can't see me playing the same server come 2021. If naxx doesn't come out towards the back half of the first year, I'll probably also quit because of too long of periods of content drought. 
---
That spacing reminds me of WotLK, where naxx was out for 6 months before Ulduar came out, and after 2 months of clearing Naxx and 3 Drake Sarth, I quit and didn't come back till post ulduar (which really sucked because of how greatly regarded Ulduar was). 
---
I can't imagine some phases taking at absolute most, more than 2 months. 
---
P1 will honestly be cleared within the first month rather easily. I probably won't be that cutting edge, but still expect to be cleared with all of it by end of month 2.
---
P2 will be cleared basically week one. World bosses will be a hoot because of world pvp shenanigans and griefing the opposing faction, but the content is overall easier than P1 content after the gear form P1 content. P3 will again probably take two months for me, possibly less.
---
P4 will be another week endeavor. Especially after P3 content gear.
---
P5 will probably take a bit longer, maybe upwards of 3 months. I don't really see this being that hard after months of farming BWL. C'thun and Twin Emps might be a bit of a slog, but with the forethought we already know of needing nature res, it'll be way easier as a whole.
---
P6 will be the real deal. But again, if we are left to farm AQ40 for months, having nearly BIS going into naxx will make a lot of the raid easy. There will the gear hurdles for sure, but everyone already knows the mechanics so the allure of the unknown doesn't exist. Possibly 4 months, just to err on the side of caution, but there is already a trend of issues.
---
If each phase is given the cycle of 3 months, which seems to be pretty common in terms of game development cycle (looking largely at something like PoE), then 6 months of just MC/Onxyia with world bosses being added after the first 3, then 6 months of just BWL with ZG being added after the first 3, I can't imagine having enough to regularly entertain. 
---
And I know their are other events to do, but I'm pretty goal orientated, so just aimlessly wandering probably won't attract me for long enough. 
---
Wow, this is a wall of text, sorry. No offense taken if you don't read this, because woah.
---
&gt;Blizzard prior to wow launching wasn’t some crazy monolith in pc gaming, they had 300 employees. 
---
Yes, but they didn't change AV until like 2006, which I am pretty sure Blizzard  had somewhat stabilized at that point (most of the chaos was in 2004). They were also almost with another expansion at that point.
---
&gt;Wonder what adventures I'll encounter along the way. None. 
---
This is actually the best phrasing to describe the issue with flying I've ever heard.
---
The true catalyst is probably losing subscribers and wondering how they could re-monitize the old player base.
---
Mass amnesia of the fact that, for example, as a deep-prot specced warrior, your last three talent points cannot be optimized and thus allow personal choice? You seem to indeed have forgotten that. For reference, I am talking about Imp. Heroic Strike, Imp. Sunder and Imp. Revenge.
---
The difference between raid tiers drops, in terms of stats, looks tiny. Maybe 5-10 Stamina, 3-6 of a primary, 1% hit/block/crit.  But those numbers were more significant because of a tighter window. Those were real upgrades, with significant impact.
---
Combine that with a lot of random unrelated effects like procs, spell damage, and just some occasional awful BiS itemization for some class/specs, and you end up in a place where comparing modern item scaling to Vanilla is impossible
---
&gt; i've had night-long discussion with my M+ group on how to time 19s and 20s. 
---
Would you had the same discussion if the M+ was a +10? Nope, you would not. So, how about NOT come with an example that less than 1% are involved in (M+20) and come an example that the VAST MAJORITY of people are involved in...like an M+10? Or an M+5?
---
Your example is absolutely IRRELEVANT.
---
Private servers were never the #1 viewed thing on twitch that just never happened
---
Your assumption that getting a couple buffs before raid wastes more time than it saves is weak and is the basis of your post. World buffs can save alot of time and it doesnt take very long to get them. On Classic that might be different.
---
Change account to NA
---
Get a different guild if drama is an issue, it isn't hard and really doesn't take very long. 
---
There is a skillcap to mythic, thats the whole fucking point. But it's not like the first few Mythic bosses are exactly difficult.
---
One of the problems with healing as shadow spec is that mages and warlocks get grumpy when you roll on their gear, especially if you are also getting all of the healer gear.
---
Clipping depends on you ranged weapon, usually ranged weapons below 3.00 pref clipped rotation over unclipped
---
&gt; some private servers have been generated by a handfull of private citizens in less time than the 2 years a multimillion dollar company with the actual files has done.
---
I think it will be much more streamlined with much less bugs (escort quests not working etc). Also all values will be correct, resulting in a much better 'vanilla experience' than those pservers.
---
looks like something out of The Thing
---
*at least one hunter per group needs trueshot
---
If you're not giving the buff, you're gimping the groups dps.
---
Futher up the thread, people are complaining about how unfair it is to "punish someone for life happening" or that you could plea your case in Discordd and any reasonable guild would have leeway. 
---
That is what I mean  “Participation awards for participating late”
---
Nothing in return other than exactly what they wanted. Official vanilla servers.
---
I thought gametime wasn't the trigger for "beta invites". I guess I was wrong. But I wont sub either way and patiently wait for the release.
---
Yes. The candy example (even if Nixxiom or Asmon did it way before...or it was Asmon reacting to Nixxiom? I can't remember :D).
---
Yes, too much candy is bad.
---
Anyway, I helped with the upvotes:)
---
Your a leisure activity,  Your Primetime, might be someone else's church time,  night school time,  Everyday the world is becoming  less limited by the numbers on the wall clock.  
---
It's very short sided to pick a "prime time" for each time zone.
---
&gt;**Is this really so problematic though?** And far as I recall that was because of set bonuses and not the actual Naxx gear being better...Kara was ilvl 115 with a 50% cost decrease on +Sta, Naxx was ilvl ~86.
---
Well yes, because gear progression is one of the biggest reasons that people play.
---
&gt;And far as I recall that was because of set bonuses and not the actual Naxx gear being better.
---
To some extent, maybe yes. But your proposition of reducing the ilvl inflation would obviously mean that gap is far less.
---
Also, set bonuses etc were/are a large part of what made items actually interesting to have/use - and a lot of their strength.
---
&gt;The issue is jumping it too much during the expansion so that the spread between opening day and closing day is utterly huge.
---
That's because - as I said - people like gear based progression. And play for it. Blizz metrics have told them the current system is the best under their design philosophy and I'm inclined to believe in metrics and their own personal insight etc.
---
&gt;It completely invalidates all previous raid tiers and content
---
Thats... kinda the point. WoW raiding revolves around the current tier now. That's a conscious design choice.
---
On on hand I didn't mind how progression used to work. But there were HUGE downsides to it as well. Especially on the front of actually managing a guild. Players today are generally not that attached to their guilds either (similar to the irl job world). It used to be a huge nightmare to recruit for any guild doing lower tiers (shit players everywhere) as well as any time you downed a milestone your better players are likely to get poached or look to move to a guild a tier up. 
---
Also, unless they heavily nerf mythic difficulty when its no longer current tier - there is no way guilds trying to progress lower tiers would ever be able to clear the content. At which point it's not really an authentic experience anymore so what's the point?
---
Similarly, I think the novelty of "wow that guys in a top tier guild" has worn off long ago too.
---
&gt;Seeing a new wing of a raid for the first time and killing the next boss used to be unbelievably epic experiences in this game.
---
I remember watching mediocre TV shows and seeing cliché/tropes for the first time they seemed pretty awesome too. 
---
I think after over a decade people just generally aren't as excited about bosses now as before. And I don't think that's on the game really.
---
&gt;We've traded that for a game where the base level raids are cleared by decent guilds on literally the first night they're released...multiple times in fact across a half dozen alts. Then the only race is to see who can re-clear it on the highest difficulty level.
---
This is like saying "XY speedrunner does Z game in only 30 minutes" why has the world come to this! Meanwhile 99.999999% of the population complete it in 100 hours.
---
Unless you're actively raiding and trying for world top 5 you're not doing that shit. It has zero impact on you.
---
&gt;Then the only race is to see who can re-clear it on the highest difficulty level.
---
I think you mean THE RACE, because for guilds with the best players in the world it's kinda obvious that lower difficulties aren't part of the race, or even a consideration. To call it "reclearing" seems silly.
---
They have all cleared them (and always have done so) on beta/ptr etc priorly anyway. So if that's the logic then the race never existed and it was always a race to reclear.
---
&gt;Each new room I got to see felt so rewarding, and each new boss we pulled had me feeling nervous and fully knowing it might be another couple weeks before we actually kill it.
---
I can't speak to the wonder of seeing a new room since you've probably seen quite a few. But mythic bosses generally don't just flop. 
---
&gt;In modern WoW it still takes my guild weeks upon weeks to get through Mythic, the difficulty is crazy high, but there's nothing terribly special about it aside from the actual feat of a new kill. I've already seen this entire raid two dozen times on Normal and Heroic. I've already killed every single boss two dozen times on Normal and Heroic. I'm not making "progression" in this zone in an RPG sense of the word...I'm only increasing my score. Even the gear is all identical aside from skins and stat numbers.
---
If you don't mind me asking, what is your current CoS progress / world rank for BoD?
---
&gt;At some point the devs decided that $15/mo buys everyone the right to kill every single boss in the game and to own every single item in the game. Unfortunately making it that easy has completely cheapened the thrill and feeling of immersion that raiding used to have.
---
I can't say that I really care that others are able to experience the raids on a lower difficulty.
---
As a mythic raider I clear heroic at the very start of the tier for gear. Then in 2 weeks mythic comes out and heroic might be run to boost for gold or for gear if people still need. It has very little impact / time spent on it since it's a speed clear after week 1. 
---
I honestly don't see how people being able to do LFR cheapens your mythic experience but maybe that's just me.
---
Getting in to site building atm, may I ask what framework this is running?
---
I took off 4 days from work the week after launch so that i know any issues like that will be fixed by then. Fingers crossed it isnt too bad initially though!
---
I don't think outright removing them in raids is the only option for Classic+. I'd just give them diminishing returns. Make it so getting *one* world buff is beneficial but any more just isn't worth the effort.
---
No, thats the contrived example you made up. We are talking about world buffs in general. It takes my group all of 5 minutes eight now to drop ZG and Ony  buff and get to Thorium Point. It is definitely a time save unless we wipe on the first boss and noone feels its wasted time.
---
Rest of the 28 days are BfA money u just paid. Well played.
---
I play dwarf Hunter when you still had to toggle stone form on and off because it showed you.  Even in that state I found out first hand how amazing it was against rogues.
---
The only thing I'm trying to prove to you is that Mythic raiding isn't as much as a time sink as people seem to think it is - As I have stated time and time again, a massive amount of players in the guilds I've been in (Between world 200-500 spanning WOTLK -&gt; Cata, and then Legion -&gt; Early BFA) a lot of the players only logged on to raid. 
---
I only ever played in 2 Night mythic raiding guilds, I was in 3 night guilds for the start of some expansions when I was really hyped to raid a lot, but often I disliked it and could find better guilds that raided less.
---
Bringing an unpopular spec doesn't make for a fuck up but gives you insurance against a fuck you.
---
&gt; What are the actual odds of open world events like Arathi PvP or drake kiting to Stormwind/Org?   
---
&gt;It is happening in Beta because A) the level cap of 40 and B) none of this gear/honor matters so the streamers are doing whatever they can to make content for their streams. 
---
This stuff happens w/o streamers on private servers so it'll happen in game too, but yeah it will happen less when classic releases as there are more things to do at 60 lvl cap than 40 lvl cap.
---
When BC came out level 59 twinking got real with higher ilvl gear from the new zones.
---
Just gotta pull out that wand and role play some Harry Potter.
---
I had a gladiator ranked ele shaman in BC, and a 39 twink rogue and honestly I might have had more fun on my rogue lol
---
Doesn’t only 1 hunter need to have it? Or is there any benefit from having more than 1 hunger with trueshot?
---
I am having really hard time NOT subbing back to WoW (after stopping before BfA).
---
But since it's easier to NOT sub to BfA than quit smoking...no matter how much of a hole I have inside me until August 27th, I will NOT resub to BfA.
---
Lmao you're both retards still playing but trying to pretend that one side is better than the other. 
---
You probably just play on a dead server
---
&lt;Deicide&gt;
---
We are a HORDE Semi-hardcore raiding guild intending to roll on a high population PvP server. We are located in the Central USA timezone. SENSE OF HUMOR REQUIRED TO CONTINUE.
---
Democratic Loot Council System
---
What we offer:
---
Laid back but competitive environment. Leadership has cleared content thru Naxx in vanilla. We might not be server first but we will certainly push for it and we wont be far behind. We want to clear all content in a timely manner while having fun. That being said having fun is not wiping 17 times on trivial content so don't expect the raid to be filled with boomkins &amp; enhance shammies.
---
We will have a democratic loot council system with a high council (founding leadership) and elected class officers. Class officers will be elected by the core raiders of their class. There will be a total of 50 core raiders who will be guaranteed raid spots and vote for their class officer. To maintain core member status you must attend 80% of scheduled raid content as well as being geared &amp; consumable prepared. Elections will be held the week after entering MC the first time and every 3-4 months after that. There is a system of checks and balances to stave off corruption and provide transparency in place.
---
What we expect from you:
---
We expect you to have fun playing this amazing game with a group of dedicated and knowledgeable gamers. Having a sense of humor is required as stated above. We expect you to be prepared for the content. The guild will help you as much as we can to make sure you succeed. We will provide the knowledge and resources necessary but ultimately it is your responsibility to know the fights and  the appropriate gear and consumables for your class.
---
If this sounds like your cup of tea please contact me on discord carl#1501 or jump in https://discord.gg/nFt3qqj
---
The original rollout off flying prevented one from getting a flying mount or the skill until level 70. Levels 60-70 still experienced the world from the ground and were completely open to world PvP. 
---
Hitting level 70, then accomplishing the feat of training for flying mounts and epic flying mounts was part of the magic of reaching max level for me, and it opened up the ultra-epic quest lines at Skettis and the grind for your Netherwing Drake!
---
The release of WotLK was no little less restrictive in Northrend, with level 80 being the threshold for flight, and levels 70-80 still required you to enjoy the new world content from the ground. Flight allowed vertical use of the zones in addition to the horizontal use, and made for some interesting quest lines after hitting level 80. The other QOL upgrades, such as dungeon finder and achievements, is what started us on the track of destroying the game, in my opinion. 
---
It wasn’t until Cata and the advent of flight in the old world that I think it completely destroyed the game, but that also came with many other QOL upgrades, that in my opinion ruined the game. I’ve always felt that restricting flight until max level during any xpac would be the best way to go, but would be fine with making it a skill with a CD rather than a free for all option...
---
It's not an exploit, it's an oversight. Dungeons and Raids aren't a part of the "world" after all.
---
Don't wait for what? I'm just pointing out why some people don't like it. You're not going to *talk someone into* liking it, if they don't like it. 
---
Of course it's not going to happen in the first month. Did I say anything about the only concern being during the early life of the server? Do you only care about the concerns of the people who start playing on day one?
---
Yes, of course an old servers will have high levels terrorizing lowbies on pvp servers... that's my point. Some people don't want to deal with that.
---
And in my example, it doesn't matter how many defenders you have. A high level horde can run in and one-shot the NPC.

The return of classic
---
Why do you think it takes hours to get World buffs? Sure maybe if you are getting every one. But most grpups just get ony and zg and maybe DMF   the others are optional. It takes 5 minutes.
---
All roles are great in their own way.
---
* Tanks get the spotlight and gear priority but have the most pressure.
---
* Healers are the babies, strats and set-ups change for the healers, even if it's their fault.  Your view of the raid is better, depending on how heal intense the fight ends up.  You can look around more and pull off odd ball things, like change targets, see stuff, cleanse, whatever.  Kind of like a raid supervisor.  
---
* DPS is the mini-game.  You're a numbers whore, every fight you need to nail that rotation flawlessly.  Many find it the most fun.  Susceptible to tunnel vision, with the least amount of spare time for other raid utility.  
---
I've never main tanked for raids.  Played healer and dps for years.  All are fun in their own way.  I find healing to be the most laid back with variety.  Sometimes you heal MT or raid, or cleanse.  Sometimes you tunnel vision too on raid health bars, other times you can spare tab target or alert the raid of incoming patrols.  DPS you don't want a CC target, you don't want to move, you just want to bang out that rotation perfectly with optimal potion and cooldown usuage.
---
Well, that would be a REASON. As opposed to "just for the sake of it."
---
But if my main spec is prot, I'd expect to be suggested mainly prot items, or for there to be a heavier emphasis on prot related stats. But if I pick holy it's like I never picked prot as my spec at all, it only suggests holy things. I mean, I know prot pally itemization is bad, but it's not THAT bad.
---
Dont forget about those raptor claws
---
I did the F2P version of wow last week and reported two minor bugs I found in hopes they would put me in beta :P. No luck so far. Account created in vanilla, but havnt subbed since MoP
---
NA PvP or PvE alliance
---
Looking for 2-3 nights a week (prefer 2) raiding guild starting at 8:30-9:30 EST. 
---
I will be rolling Hunter and will be hopefully level 60 within a month. I would like a guild that has minimal Hunters, I don't want to be one of 6, preferably no more than 3 in a 40 man raid. 
---
My experience. 
---
Ex server first and consistently parsing top 200 worldwide as a warlock and Hunter in wotlk and cata. Experience playing vanilla and tbc but did not raid very much as I was very casual. 
---
I will be constantly competing for top Hunter dps, and TBH the reason I'm playing Hunter and not a top tier dps class is because I love the class, the dps rotation, the world pvp ability etc etc. 
---
I know my damage will fall off after BWL. 
---
Experience leading raids and experience being a class officer.
---
I should have added the qualifier number one wow related thing streamed on twitch. Mah bad for the mistake.
---
How about a preview before a shitty broken captcha and email verification? Or, and bare with me here, neither of those?
---
All we can do until August 27th is speculation. Thanks for saying that my speculation was great, and not crap:D

I was a rogue for a good bit in vanilla, but I capped level too late and it was hard to find groups because everyone had a rogue. Switched to a dwarf priest, hit my 40s, PvP for a few months since I was decked out in great gear from dungeons and had a ton of fun. Finished out leveling and got snagged immediately for some MC raiding. Good times, good times. 
---
Now I am torn between priest or druid, never really gave druid much thought back then.
---
u lost a bet LUL
---
its impossible, your brother is correct on everything.     
---
take your time and enjoy the journey
---
You will not be 60 in 6 days lol. No, this won’t ruin the game for you. Think about classic made of two parts. The journey to max level and then the endgame content. You can enjoy both of them, just one step at a time.
---
Sorry yes, june :) sorry for confusing people
---
We will have a democratic loot council system with a high council (founding leadership) and elected class officers. Class officers will be elected by the core raiders of their class. There will be a total of 50 core raiders who will be guaranteed raid spots and vote for their class officer. Core raider slots will go to the 40 members who make it to the first MC run. To maintain core member status you must attend 80% of scheduled raid content as well as being geared &amp; consumable prepared. Elections will be held the week after entering MC the first time and every 3-4 months after that. There is a system of checks and balances to stave off corruption and provide transparency in place.
---
&gt; The second it was obvious it might be profitable they jumped at the opportunity.
---
This is what people don't understand about Classic. Money talks. It's not about how popular something is, it is about how much money you can make off it. Because Classic is low-effort and highly lucrative they'll jump on it. If BC is just as lucrative they'll jump on that. 
---
This "Classic+" shit people keep slinging is not. It's high-risk, high-cost, low-reward. There's no reason for Blizzard to ever go that way unless they find a way to monetize Classic+ with a cash-shop, since right now the cash-shop, including race changes and WoW tokens is keeping the game "healthy" according to Blizzard. Considering many Classic fans consider cash-shop the anti-thesis of WoW and would boycott, there's no good way forward for "Classic+". People need to learn to just take Classic for what it is, enjoy it while it lasts.
---
That or “META”
---
I get the most enjoyment out of MMOs from endgame content and playing with friends. I rolled PvE in Vanilla and had lots of fun doing the things that I wanted to, when I wanted to. This time around, I'll find a guild that has the same goals as me. That's how I'll make my choice.
---
A lot of two-handers are obvious PVP weapons. Sulf, Zin'rokh, DEoI.
---
For PVE they're better for Horde than Alliance because of windfury.
---
Alliance tends to be weapon-inefficient, with warriors and rogues all wanting the same one-handed swords because of the human racial, lack of windfury, and lack of good one-handed maces. Meanwhile Horde can make good use of axes, two-handers, and daggers.
---
This is one of the reasons Classic is so cool, and the talent tree, which seems so limited, actually leaves a lot of options open for different playstyles.
---
Mileage != ping.
---
Benediction tho?
---
He's said that English is not his first language.
---
Without practice, not really.
---
With practice, you can easily reach 5 days /played. So you'd have to play 20 hours a day.
---
With help and a lot of practice, you can get it under 100 hours. That's ~17 hours a day.
---
nah that would have taken the fun out of it. my original comment is because i'm beavertranq's MT. So comment on his post every now and then about doing the opposite of what he thinks and get downvoted alot.
---
 What’s the modern mailing system?
---
It's like you crop dusted that lion after a big protein binge.
---
I don’t see anywhere in this comment thread advocating for rewarding people for participating late. I’m not quite sure what you’re saying then, I guess. 
---
Is it that people who show up late should get a 50% dkp hit per boss like one comment mentions? 
---
If that’s the case, my only take is that if you showed up late, you already missed the DKP from bosses already pulled and the bonus start time DKP (from the other example in this thread), if the guild is forced to wait for you specifically then yeah, other agreements or punishments need to be discussed. Is it a one time thing? Recurring? What role do you play? Take a bench role? 
---
But we need to clarify what “participation awards for participating late” means to you
---
I played on both PvE and PvP (Emerald Dream) servers during TBC and then into Wrath. IMO PvP on a PvP server was actually worse than on a PvE server. On the PvE server there were still plenty of fights in Tarren Mill, Crossroads, Hellfire Peninsula, et al. On Emerald Dream "world PvP" was about one thing and one thing only : ganking. Nobody would take part in ongoing fights because all they wanted to do was get the jump on someone.
---
I'm glad I rolled on a PvP server to experience it, but I won't be doing it again.
---
You can level in that time but it is going to be hard. It won't ruin the game for you but it may degrade the classic experience for you.
---
Nah. I started in BC and loved the game until MOP. Reliving the zones as they were pre cata will be great.
---
Hello, Everyone.  I would like to introduce a guild named: "Bourbon Raiders." We are a casual, family-oriented guild recruiting for Classic.
---
Our goal: provide a guild for people that have more responsibilities at home. If you work 50+ hours, have 3 kids like me, you're perfect. We will complete all endgame content both PvP and PvE. So, whatever your goals are in classic we look forward to helping you complete them.

I have June 19-21 off, was going to get a few things done around the house...
---
...well fuck. “The new shelves are taking longer than I thought, honey, no idea why.”
---
Oh I know it was back in the day, because of the overall glory and unknown aspect of the game back then, But nowadays, we basically know everything there is to know. We know what the pre-raid BIS gear is. We know the best way to farm honor. We know all dungeon and raid mechanics. We've explored the world, in its various forms, for 14+ years. I kinda think the sense of wonder from Vanilla is all but entirely gone. 
---
Not to mention the issues of DHKs for people wanting to get higher ranks. I just don't see it happening as frequently as it did back in the day. 14 years is a LONG time for society standards to change. I'm mainly looking for pserver evidence. Reminiscing on something that happened frequently even 10 years ago is wildly irrelevant.
---
 &lt;Invictus&gt; Now Recruiting PvP/Alliance/NA/Semi-Hardcore/EST
---
Introduction
---
We are long-time MMO/ WoW players that are new to the vanilla WoW Experience and are looking for more similar and likeminded players to form a community experience with.
---
Member expectations
---
We understand that some members have jobs and schedules that may prevent them from regular participation. While we expect some level of activity, we do seek to accommodate players who may find themselves unable to frequent scheduled guild activities.
---
PVP
---
For phase one we will be encouraging WPvP and city raids while we build a repuation as a notorious PvP guild in our server’s community. For phase two and beyond we would like to begin farm rank 10s through premade bgs. Should there be a demand for it then an Elite placement team pushing for ranks 11-13 is to be expected.
---
Our events schedule includes phase one raiding and beyond. Our goal is not min maxing but a fun raiding experience in our own time. We will be using the loot council system in the utmost fair way possible for efficiency and fairness.
---
Schedule:
---
Raiding on Tuesday and Wednesday 8:00 - 11:00 P.M Eastern Time. PvP events will be spontaneous until further notice (Phase 2)
---
Recruitment
---
We currently are looking to recruit class leads for every class. We also have openings for almost every spec and class on our team. We currently have special positions open for our raid team.
---
Message an officer to get into the discord or for any additional details and our special organized guild events.
---
Valdaram#1800 or MilesDauss#1563 (Admin) (Bnet)
---
Or Valdaram#7767 On Discord
---
Oh no, theyre getting way too much appreciation!
---
It wasn't just that. Ranged attacks also couldn't glance.
---
"and got nothing in return"
---
They literally stole intellectual property and got donations for it.
---
I'm glad we got classic, but please stop supporting intellectual property crime.
---
Hey, I applied on your website. Can't wait to hear from you guys again!
---
So uh, how much money did you just lose?
---
Right when I log on I usually get at least 50 water. Since we have teleport, we should be one of the first there so we have time to make water. I usually make 200 water for a 5 man and like 100 food. Most people are fine with just 1 stack
---
Honestly I think having one 2H warrior is actually better for the raid.
---
Dps is still competitive, cleave damage is very high, rogues/warriors will have less competition for 1H weapons, and 2H drops won't be wasted.
---
I don't see it as a "sub-optimal spec," at least not in the same way hybrids are. There's no other competitive 2H dps after all.
---
I thought charging for an addon was against ToS? Or maybe the addon is free, but useless without paying for the guide... which is currently free on his website. I don't know. Maybe something like, "No officer, we weren't selling beer to underagers - we charge them for the cups, sure, but the beer is free."
---
The tune that plays when you ride into Stormwind for the first time.
---
So you would thi k human warriors would be good with 1h maxes die to their racial.
---
Can horde warriors use 2 handed in PVE well? I know on the alliance side if your pve it's arms and  duel wielding
---
I actually leveled as a prot paladin back in Vanilla.  Fun times too.
---
No. It's on average 20 days real time if you play 12 hours a day.
---
People keep saying that, but I've actually never seen anybody shit talk private servers. I've only ever seen people shit talking people who shit talk private servers. Am I just l not looking in the right place? Also, why would anybody dislike private servers anyways? Just doesn't add up
---
Idk man. There’s a lot of stuff to dislike with retail, but I actually like the way a lot of spells and abilities look now. There isn’t one single new animation you like?
---
request urls?  That's definitely an option.  you have a link to a guide for that?
---
What kind of argument is that? No, some people don't want to "deal with it". Some people want to move without getting harassed. That's *why* there are pve servers.
---
Great. *You'd rather*... being key words, there. Some people "would rather" not being constantly attacked by other players. 
---
It's like you're trying to convince people who don't like vanilla ice cream, that it's the best ice cream and their preference is wrong and boring. No, it's just your opinion on what is boring, fun/unfun.
---
50 bucks evidently
---
We can mail multiple things at once up to I think 10-15? Can’t remember. Back in vanilla you could only mail one item at a time, and when you were done you would have to type or paste the name of the character you were mailing stuff to. It was just a hassle, didn’t make the game better, harder more challenging or anything it was just an annoyance. Now with the current system it’s just much easier to transfer items to alts or COD large amounts of trade goods to other players on the server.
---
I'm just pointing out why that reason is not true to the game for the first few months. If you are trying to talk people out of it or make an explination using misinformation then I'll call it out.
---
&gt;Of course it's not going to happen in the first month. Did I say anything about the only concern being during the early life of the server? Do you only care about the concerns of the people who start playing on day one? 
---
You don't have to say a direct quote for people to refute a point you make using information that does not directly get qouted from you....
---
&gt;Do you only care about the concerns of the people who start playing on day one?  
---
&gt;Yes, of course an old servers will have high levels terrorizing lowbies on pvp servers... that's my point. Some people don't want to deal with that.
---
I was just saying the point is not consistent throughout the game like you implied, by failing to point out that detail. 
---
I care about the whole time and saying X is the reason when it is not always the reason is plainly and obviously inncorect.
---
Ogres anywhere for mDPS grinding, like in Duskwood
---
Honesty though, who cares about getting to max level in a stress test where your characters will be wiped after 2 days?
---
Roll hunter go ham win the bet and then go back on your basic mount to redo the content you need to do that you missed like professions while simultaneously savoring in your victory.
---
And hope your'e on the right layer
---
Newer expansions are only time gated for the first month or 2. 
---
Log in now and you can grind everything up to where you should be for 8.2
---
Oh no, its just so horrible if they get an appreciation post every 3 months
---
What is that? Can't find any info...
---
There's still very little raid-level loot for dps warriors. It's a similar situation to other hybrid classes, when you don't have a tier set it's not that easy finding good items.
---
Joana's speedrun was hardcore because he refused assistance. If you have a support system, you can get the /played to 60 under 100 hours.
---
This could also backfire by amplifying the viewership drop off after the initial hoorah and give people the impression that classic won't have long lasting interest.
---
But anyway twitch viewership isn't remotely as important as you make it out to be.
---
Do you know how frequently/infrequently? I don't expect a solid "Yes, at least once every 6 days" kinda response, but just overall curious as to what a typical Pserver world event frequency is after 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year after F R E S H.
---
Evidently I just lost 50 bucks
---
Searing Pain - Imp

---
They did get something. They got Classic. They put in the hard work and sacrifice, but we all wanted the same thing.
---
first off can I just say how mind blowing flying was. I will never forget getting my flying for first time. all I did was mount and fly onto the roof... that's it.... and it BLEW my mind. back in those days flying had no down sides. no negatives, just a bonus.
---
you could see straight away the cracks forming. World PVP died almost overnight and when I say overnight I literally mean one day it was there and the next day there was no world pvp… how? everyone was always sat on their brand new flying mounts (ALWAYS) so as soon as any one attacked just press our space bar and game over.
---
can immersion and flying co-exist? no. no they cannot.
---
People don't all realize this.  It's what basically role locks you through Vanilla.
---
Played a vanilla Pally, was perpetually broke.  It caps at 50g and deteriorates only like 5 gold per month I think.  Raiding was holy, but just thinking about going Prot for a random 5 man, or Ret for AV weekend, was a costly 100g.
---
&gt; Although I have no idea when Dungeon Set 2 will be available in classic.
---
AQ patch, phase 5.
---
LFL ; locks for lyfe
---
The privilege of paying to play Classic after Blizzard fucked them all with no lube.
---
No, and even if it would that is part of the launch release i don't want to miss. I know that might sound retarded but it is what it is.
---
It was more so about how the game was basically over when DKs came in, they ruined all sort of class balance. You could tank in all three specs, have massive CC, and still one-shot players (got hit for 15k in an arena match once when our HPs were only 14k at the time)
---
Definitely not impossible, just improbable without practice, dedication, and preparation.
---
Yeah - the previous 2 weren't great, at least around launch time. I got on and plunked around the following day on the first one - and during the second, it still took an hour to log on. I got to 10, but the play experiences aren't great since they're actually testing stuff. Expanding and collapsing layers pretty frequently during the tests, things like that. I'll log on to this one if I can during the stress portion, but I'm just way too busy this week to really devote any time to it.
---
You are talking like if vanilla isn't about 3 shoting people. And remember that you have to realize that the rogue is using that potion.
---
Buy it
---
the world record is 4 days and some hours real time.  so it is technically possible in 6 days
---
I absolutely love how since the announcement of Classic so many online tools and perks like this have popped up, my Reddit save list is going crazy. It's like a WoW renaissance. Keep up the great work OP!
---
WC looks like an old adventure film.
---
Litterally the parent of this thread says this, verbatim.  
---
" That's stupid. Real life, especially now that most of the original WoW player base is comprised of people who are most likely parents ar this point, sometimes gets in the way. Showing up 30 minutes late because your daughter's soccer game took a little longer than expected to wrap up and punishing players with 50% DKP is a surefire way to ensure you slowly lose the players in your guild. "
---
I don't understand what you're confused about. 
---
I'm saying that the guild policy states, you take a hit for being late. Its simple. Late cause your kid puked all over your keyboard, or late cause your GF was tossing your salad, Late is late.  Giving leway to people with whatever experiences causes drama. As a dad who shows up on time, I certainly have had my PC covered in formula, and I get it.  But, I dont think I or any other dads deserve the on time bonus, just because life happened.
---
Compared to millions doing nothing, except playing the retail game and actually just contributing negatively
---
Yeah and heard "nope"

---
I haven't checked it out yet,  but I think this is what I needed.
---
I'd be really interested to know how far you do end up getting in 6 days.  I'm gonna guess 47.  Maybe 50.
---
don't those speedlvling guides all have gold, bags and gear lined up for them?
---
pretty sure they also log out to profit from the offline hearthatone CD reduce.
---
They also won't have to fight for mobs with 50 other players.
---
No way he does that
---
I mean if you get corrupted ashbringer go ahead and use it lol.
---
I have no sympathy for anyone who would break the terms of service. Theft is wrong.
---
yeah I agree with this, I'm guilty of making a statement that could be interpreted in multiple ways.
---
Yet youre happy to be there to play Classic when it comes
---
Neat.
---
This implementation would not be the first time a similar concept was executed. The MMO Global Agenda had a similar mechanic. That game had an instance-based "board" for their frontiers rather than a freely explorable space like DAOC, but gated when you could move around the board during certain times of day. The game did plenty well during its run, and really only shot itself in the foot due to mismanagement in other aspects of the game. That system was actually liked quite a bit. 
---
As far as your argument - we're talking about group based activities. If nobody else is playing when you're playing, it doesn't really matter if you can log in at 4 AM. How many raid guilds in WoW raid at 4 AM anyways? 
---
Lastly, another point of comparison - games like Warcraft 3 run tournaments during certain times of day. If you can't be online to participate in those tournaments, too bad so sad - you don't get to participate in them. Period. That's the way it works, if you want to play, log on the game when the event is running. 
---
I think the system would be a roaring success in a modern MMO, especially today when most people only have a few hours to log in each night and can't be bothered to wake up at 4 AM to defend their relic keep from a ninja attempt.
---
Wouldn't streaming a pserver break Twitch TOS?
---
I’d wager there’s probably one giant underground cable connecting California to Oceania while the routing for the EU to California has to go through a lot of different nodes before they reach destination. 
---
Google underwater cable map and you can see there is indeed several directly from Australia/Oceania to the west coast.
---
PS, this isn't a shot at you personally.  It's just super hard to grind to 60 in a quick manner.  I dunno about ya'll, but I need sleep haha.
---
6 real time days (as opposed to 6 in game days - which is actually still a fast 60) is going to be hard without practice.
---
That said, I did grind 1-60 in 8 real life days, back in vanilla on an orc warrior, but I considered myself a very experienced warrior player at that time and really knew the zones inside and out. Also had zero obligations for those 8 days. If you go hunter and have a lot of knowledge it's possible. But you'll be lacking a lot of sleep probably.
---
I'd say it's not worth attempting unless your bet is for $500+
---
I would take a bet that you won't make it to lvl 40 in 6 days
---
&gt; And there was definitly group quests in Wrath.
---
2-3 Group quests in BC and Wrath were soloable by a number of classes. Hunter, Warlock, druid, DK, I forget what else.
---
If you start researching routes now and get an amphetamine Rx you have a chance
---
Yes. Two-handers work fine in PvE, but you still go fury spec. So unfortunately you'll be swapping specs either way.
---
I never found the right guild. It's sad too. I tried a lot.
---
Hopped from server to server until I gave up. 
---
With classic I have a chance at doing raids that most people can clear and I may finally find a real home.
---
Where did I use misinformation? 
---
So, in my example of level 60s ganking level teen players, you felt the need to point out that this isn't possible... before level 60 toons even exist? Really. 
---
Where am I *uncalm*? I think you're projecting your frustration and discomfort of someone having a differing opinion from yours. You should grow up and learn how to deal with someone not agreeing with you, like a mature adult.
---
Its a circlejerk sub just say retail bad classic good and move on with it
---
Is this...is this the Wall of No+ ?
---
Sounds like a pussy, i'd take him
---
And I said farm gold.....what?
---
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that blizzard tried to hire the devs from the server.
---
doubt it.
---
I just started a new job a few weeks ago and will probably only have 2 days of PTO saved up by then.  I'll probably use them the 26/27th, since the game actually releases 3PM on the 26th for the west coast people.
---
That's a global release countdown, the release is simultaneous around the world regardless of timezone. 70 days for everyone.
---
That's where my mind went. "If you don't pull I'm pulling. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go."
---
Yep I always loved the dudes we played with in TBC but raiding slowly and with terrible players sucked. 
---
Transferring to a server 1st guild in wrath and the impact was huge. People cared about progress, competed with each other and worked hard to help everyone get better. 
---
A much better environment for raiding
---
No, it's all just one solid difficulty... "Piss easy".
---
&gt; That's pretty hype if you care about the future of the genre.
---
This too.
---
Ouch that stinks. Several good pieces for DPS warriors stuck in MC runs predominantly
---
&gt; don't those speedlvling guides all have gold, bags and gear lined up for them?
---
No, Joana's guide and the record he based it off of was on a completely new server with no assistance.
---
&gt; pretty sure they also log out to profit from the offline hearthatone CD reduce.
---
Again, no. First, there is no bonus to being logged out besides rested XP. And Joana's goal was to be the first level 60, so logging out was no good.
---
&gt; They also won't have to fight for mobs with 50 other players.
---
If you practice enough, you'll still be able to get to 30 within 24 hours. That will give you enough of a lead to never have any competition.
---
hooooly shit i forgot all about thottbot!!!
---
Cute u know :)
---
You see city raids quite frequently maybe if you play frequently you will see one or two a week. When a mob like you suggested gets kited into a city the event really takes shape from that point, and a really small group can start a really big event. A lot of stuff is done by guilds and others hop on the bandwagon from what ive seen, like killing Jaina for fun/the gold. 
---
Im thinking most servers are going to have dedicated discords and I bet the events people try to start will be listed in those areas as well. 
---
The longer the server is up and closer the server is to the next phase the more events you will see, they happen when people get bored, more people get bored when their is less content.
---
Its not impossible but youre going to have to basically not sleep for a week and be perfect or find people willing to feed you items for speed
---
Yes because when you think about it, as a support/utility dps spec, spell power increases your dps AND healing capabilities. 
---
I personally would love to see a full Judgment ret/holy pally with a decent 2her smacking away at the boss whilst throwing out cleanses and occasional heals/bops etc
---
For some time, mage mana stones and healthstones shared the same cooldown, so I never got in the habit of using them. Even when they were separated (possibly in Vanilla, can't remember now), I still don't remember them.
---
Either a really bad joke, or you're fairly delusional.
---
You get to keep the characters, but still.
---
Only thing i see to note, I highly suggest you put one point in Prep after hemo or even before. This will save your life from time-to-time and is one of the most broken tools that a rogue has (because all of their CD's are broken)
---
So what you’re saying is that you agree that people who show up late should take that DKP hit in that system.

Ok, yeah I agree then. I didn’t directly see anyone offering the inverse which is what you were saying “participation rewards for participating late” and that’s where the mix up occurred. We’re on the same page then. Gg
---
Sounds like Blizzard achieved their goal of re-creating the Vanilla WoW experience.
---
You're right. Oh God what have I done.
---
/u/GritsUI, I'm also having this issue... If you leave before entering the confirmation number, there appears to be no way back to that view/route.
---
I'll help "stick it to the man" by resubbing and giving them more money. That'll show them!
---
That's like saying bullying is just a part of the highschool experience.
---
And it's not for EU.
---
Man, I really want TBC.... 
---
Personally I would prefer to see WoW Classic progress like an alternate version of the Time line. I'd like to see more content added. Maybe never go beyond level 60 and never, ever add Looking For Dungeon/Raid!
---
They cna always release TBC servers. With a free server transfer.
---
&gt; players that are dissatisfied with BFA and on some level view Classic as the next xpack that provides new content for them... however flawed that might be.
---
Why exactly would that be flawed.  I would like to say I am not one of those people btw, however, I would argue that for many wow players Classic wow can be seen as the biggest release the game has had in a very, very long time. Not to mention with the ever growing buzz around the idea of post naxx content, I would argue saying this isn't the next big thing for many wow players is ridiculous. Sure this is not the next expansion.  But for many this is more then an expansion, more then just having official classic servers. Just look at this subreddit and you will see that people are treating this like WOW 2. They want an opportunity to seen wow go in a different direction.  I would once again direct you to this very subreddit where we multiple posts daily that reach the front page about the possibilities of new content and new direction. For players of retail wow it would be difficult not to see this as the next step of wow.
---
There aren't really any nonviable classes or ones that you need to avoid. Difficulty is fairly flat, hunter might be the most mechanically difficult but it's still extremely friendly to beginners. Tanking might be somewhat difficult to a beginner if you've not played any mmorpgs before, its always the most complex role, but don't let that discourage you if that's the role you want.
---
Hope they open one on the eu forums too. Oh wait.
---
IDK, why do they need to change the classes? Just start dropping gear with set bonuses or unique traits that make different specs more viable.
---
Just saw this as well. 
---
 **This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account in the Americas &amp; Oceania region. For players who have not yet tested World of Warcraft Classic, the game will become available for download late tomorrow, June 18.** 
---
So everyone gets a crack at WoW Classic this time around! Also worth noting the level cap is going to be 15 and instances are unlocked, including WSG. 
---
Looking forward to seeing how the layering BS that there were so many posts about last week works with this kind of crush. Almost sounds like they're going to fit everyone onto a single server.. which is going to be absolutely insane. I can't imagine the servers will hold up to it when the limited stress tests weren't going well..
---
no they weren't . American laws don't apply to the whole world.  nostalrius eventually shut down , not because it was illegal in their country, but because they wanted to cooperate with Blizzard, the end goal being OFFICIAL vanilla servers.    Evidence?  All the other pservers that keep being online years later
---
Thats fatal
---
I'll be supplicating myself upon the altar of RNGesus
---
neither is mine, I'm just trying to understand what the hell he's talking about.
---
&gt; If you have a support system...
---
With a support system, yes. BUT on a fresh server, a good enough support system is very very unlikely.
---
I don't think I'm more right than anybody.
---
Hostages? It's a multiplayer game, nobody is obligated to group with you if they don't like you &amp; I'm not an exception.
---
I really tought Blizzard would hire them for classic team, sad
---
I don't have multiple accounts on reddit Menis
---
That's what realm transfer and/or paid name changes are for.
---
Ret is amazing
---
Servers aren't free
---
They are legged nagas!
---
How? How can you do that?
---
Good lord, no. Both Draenei and Blood Elves were a horrible addition
---
It was the best. When /1 just trolled you it was the only help you could get finding Mankrik's wife.
---
I can easily handle a little chainpulling and fleeing mobs won’t get far.
---
Did the word thot have the same meaning in 2004 as it has today?
---
eh, not as powerful as I was hoping
---
Rush? It's not about rush, it's about having a steady run. I tanked dungeons in Vanilla 2-3 times /day for 16 months. I know them all like the back of my hand. 
---
For me, personally, and my group, it a much better option than breaking the pace of the run, because I knew how to lead.
---
It wasn't about speed...but pacing.
---
I mean you're better off not playing for the first couple days anyway... queues and starting area overload
---
That's what I'm telling myself anyway T_T
---
Time is money, friend.
---
Lets do it. I'll help.
---
I don't have Gametime, but I have Beta-Access...
---
yes it does.  creating a safe place to post BFA items in the classic wow subreddit fosters the growth of BFA topics.  there is warcraft, under that there are specific games like wc3, wow, and classicwow.
---
Hail CMaNGOS, Grand Ruler Exceptionnel of the Universe
---
Thats a win
---
&gt; Reliving the zones as they were pre cata will be great.
---
That's honestly why I want Classic. The world back then was, and still is, timeless.
---
cant wait for hunter pets and pre casting fucks !
---
Probably play a Tauren Shaman or an Undead Priest. Two of my toons from Vanilla.
---
Lets remain the game to, World of Friends, Bunnies, and cute cat video craft.
---
Just use a Script to do it every 30 Seconds.
---
Nope. I'm not sure what the Thottbot name meant, actually. Definitely wasn't today's meaning.
---
Shaman - they’re so popular I cant be a special snowflake like druids :(
---
TBH tell me what I should base it off of.  It's apart of the game is it not?
---
* THIS IS AWESOME. YOU ARE THE FIRST TO ADD IN CLASSIC "EQUIVALENCY" POINT CALCULATOR. BEFORE WOWHEAD AND CLASSICDB!!!
---
* It is not currently differentiated between armor and "bonus" armor. This is a particular issue for Bears as one gets multiplied by bear form, the other does not. But holy shnikies this has potential. THANK YOU.
---
that certainly goes for all the nostalrius spawn servers.....
---
&gt;Gnomes have been around longer than Night Elves &amp; Tauren.
---
Tauren yes, since they were just a side unit for the Orcs. Night Elves were entire playable race of their own.
---
Hell, NE have more "right" to be in WoW than Dwarves do.
---
If you think that the mechanics that *made* the things the way they are on pservers, will carry over to Classic, when those mechanics and *rules* don't exist on Classic, and never existed on Vanilla.... then you're the delusional one.
---
And if you think more than a very small percentage of people playing Classic *ever touched* a pserver, you're delusional about that too. You're coming from your little bubble pserver culture, and you're assuming all of that will just carry over to Classic. You will be surprised, then.
---
If you think most guild members will put up with extreme requirements to raid, then you haven't got a clue as to what Vanilla is like, and what Classic *will be like*. Have you only played on pservers, I'm guessing?
---
Those buffs aren't necessary, and I would bet my entire life savings that a very small percentage of guilds will require getting them. What you're going to see if people saving Ony head, getting DMF if it happens to be there, and *maybe* a DM buff for new, not-on-farm content.
---
These remind me of the DDR banners back in the day. Memories :')
---
Eh it was mainly streamers that really pushed blizz
---
"Combat" stuff isn't what I'd include in QOL, but can see why you'd think they have great qol if you include that part.
---
As soon as one person does it in the raid, it is no longer a chocie.  Everyone will see that guy doing 50% more DPS and they will be forced to follow or they get no gear
---
Several guilds have already planned this support system for WoW Classic. Dedicated instance runners, dedicated summoners, dedicated farmers, etc. They want the week one Ragnaros kill.
---
I love that expression. Slap fools.
---
&gt;Where did I use misinformation?   
---
&gt; So, in my example of level 60s ganking level teen players, you felt the need to point out that this isn't possible... before level 60 toons even exist? Really. 
---
You misinformed people by saying it'll be a problem and not stating that it won't be for a while. 
---
This glass of water isnt poisoned, but the ice is so if you don't drink it in 1h you will likly die from the poison, you left out the ice part.
---
When you ignore a linch pin of your argument ofc someone is going to point it out, 
---
&gt;Where am I *uncalm*?   
---
&gt;Yes, of course an old servers will have high levels terrorizing lowbies on pvp servers...   
---
&gt;Of course it's not going to happen in the first month.   
---
&gt;Did I say anything about the only concern being during the early life of the server?   
---
&gt;Do you only care about the concerns of the people who start playing on day one? 
---
Well consistant use of itallics is pretty telling... as well as the demeaning way you asked questions. 
---
&gt;I think you're projecting your frustration and discomfort of someone having a differing opinion from yours. You should grow up and learn how to deal with someone not agreeing with you, like a mature adult. 
---
Kettle caling the pot lol... when you start instuling the other person to try and make yourself the "winner" of the argument. 
---
Try to be nicer, its a better look.
---
Blizz didn’t design end game gear for enhancement shaman
---
I’m a wild one.
---
Neither of those will be in Classic though.
---
No...?  Did you read OP’s post?  I provided my opinion in a “discussion”. 
---
Holy shit you sound like a whiney little bitch. Get a fucking grip. It’s a video game. Lol god damn dude
---
Yes, but back in classic it was 40 people and you made 2-4 pieces at a time xD
---
FYI 4 days 20 hours.
---
I understand what you're saying and why, but I don't agree. This is little more than making rules for the sake of making rules and micromanaging people purely for micromanagement's sake. It's the same line of reasoning that says "we should limit the size of soft drinks people can order at restaurants."
---
Police yourself, not other people. Let people make their own choices. It's not surprising that the more time somebody spends on a game the more advantage they have. This is how every game ever has worked. Don't worry about those people with their huge advantages. If you don't think it's healthy to spend that much time a day in the game, then don't spend that much time each day in the game. You don't have to complete with a bunch of nolife NEETs. Most players won't be doing that.
---
WoW is a multiplayer game and outside of the PvP ladder it isn't a direct competition. Unless you're planning on going for a high PvP rank you have literally zero need to police how others play and can play at your own pace. The PvP ladder, however, is specifically a time sink for players with too much time on their hands. Let them have that. It's fine.
---
This works in bfa, but in classic not trying to immediately get agro can result in a wipe which takes a lot of time to recover from compared to bfa. (run back to the instance, buff up, drink).
---
Better to avoid the wipe and tell the dps not to ninja pull again.
---
if there's one thing activision-blizzard are good at, it's making the most money possible out of something. Shame they can't make games nearly as well :(
---
quality shitpost is quality!
---
There might be realm transfers
---
I will play the sad european class.
---
Realm transfers will be there. Nothing official on name changes for now.
---
Sounds like it's superbly well timed to me.
---
Me too. I had tailoring in vanilla on my priest. It was really anti climatic making that mooncloth bag. So much expensive mats for just a little bit more room. It was much better feeling finishing the Truefaith, but still.
---
&gt;How many raid guilds in WoW raid at 4 AM anyways?
---
You said RvR , wow isn't a RvR game... but anyway, many of them did for the raids on capital city leaders for the mount.
---
DAOC, was probably the biggest RvR game, and it was very common for guilds , or even Realms to log in at 4am to raid the frontiers.
---
All fo this, is besides the point of the thread. No matter what limitation you introduce to a game, your going to screw somebody else up. The wheel never stops turning.
---
And that's why you actually buy Curse of Recklessness
---
That's my plan too lol
---
You clearly do not understand the inquiry. It’s not whether 3% damage increase and 3% more damage on crits is GOOD. It’s whether it is better than 1% parry. And yes, it is. If you are playing your class correctly, you won’t be taking melee damage very often (and when you do, you have deterrence, scatter, fd+trap). Parry is situational. Damage output is not. The 3%+ damage increase is the clear winner.
---
"minutes slower". Interesting way to say hour(s).
---
You aren't buffing them though. Just new gear in raids. And so what if people complain? They always have. You don't have to listen to them.
---
I agree with you on preservation, and I think that removing these world buffs from raiding is a good step in preserving the raid content.  If people go into MC/BWL stacked with world buffs it will be stupidly easy  (MC will be easy either way but it will be a joke with the buffs) and that will not be a good thing for the long term health of the raiding scene.
---
The casual player will also be turned off from raiding if getting world buffs is standard for most guilds
---
Yeah, so you call it a purple shirt despite the fact that it's obviously yellow.
---
LULW
---
We were talking about the length of time they have been in warcraft, and been a part of the lore. NE were just added out of the blue in Warcraft 3, same as Tauren, meanwhile dwarves have been a part of the lore since Warcraft Orcs and Humans
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.1.0
---
No, they weren't. They were changed to not effect players over level 63 in patch 2.1.0, as indicated in the patch notes linked above.
---
Yeah my response was to the other person asking.
---
Not to mention that some admins/GMs were/are corrupt AF.
---
Its doable....maybe...for the very best speed runners.  Joanno thinks he will save 5 hours on his record time just with auto loot but the chances of you doing it are slim to none.
---
Wasn't this pattern a rare drop of a 1-time quest, so you can't even farm it without leveling to like 40 to try again?
---
lmao it is not a strawman to bring up an exploit when we are talking about what qualifies as a video game exploit.  That is a very relevant thing to bring up
---
The novelty is one reason. Also, certain shirts can fill in the empty holes in your gear to give your toon a much smoother refined look without skin showing through the gaps.
---
&gt; DAOC, was probably the biggest RvR game, and it was very common for guilds , or even Realms to log in at 4am to raid the frontiers.
---
**I'm very acutely aware. This is literally the reason for wanting this design. Nobody liked ninja relic raids**, they existed, but nobody really liked them. This is a big reason why relic keeps got more gate-keeping mechanics and "uber" guards if not enough keeps were taken before attempting to snag relics.
---
Don't forget the face palm worthy comments 2 mins later:
---
"Wait for me to get aggro!" Or "guys I need rage to use my abilities!"
---
Hearhstone cooldown decreases while being logged out. Joana even writes it in his tips and suggests to use it in speedleveling runs
---
I've been doing this for a few years with some of the people I've made friends with in this game. I have my main in my mythic progression guild, all geared to the teeth waiting to pull every other night for 4 hours straight, and then I have my 'casual' toon in my friends guild where I spend all my offtime. He's nowhere near as geared, doesn't have nearly as much gold or as many achievement points, hasn't seen half as many bosses, but I find that toon more fun than my main. 
---
The experience of just enjoying the game and relaxing with people you enjoy being around is much more fun to me. That reason alone is why I'm more excited for classic than the 8.2 patch.
---
I've made fun of that dude to his face on like multiple posts, he knows nothing about how to play the game, and just trolls assholes on the sub.
---
Anybody caught doing this bullshit should be banned permanently from the game. I hope all the 'twitchers' play Horde so that I can crush them with my Ret Pally
---
I loved this site. Always minimizing to look stuff up.
---
No, it was not the last server to be shut down.
---
wowhead has become pretty unusable for me with all the extra shit they've added into it.
---
They get banned from mention on this sub reddit Haha
---
´? Which one
---
Wow what an excellent point.  Thank you for your valuable contribution to society
---
Hope for the best &amp; expect the worst lol
---
Free mounts, health stones, soul stones, summons viable spec for everything, amazing for leveling (that’s a QOL) also the ability to not need to drink mana constantly even though it’s a skill is still a QOL. So to sum up the statement that locks only summon others for their QOL is just silly.
---
We gotta go deeper.
---
POGGERS IN THE CHATTUH
---
I don't like how there is an overflow. The old spells were distinguishable in a raid for example. Now it's blinking everywhere. And if you are alone it's also always the same blinding animation every few seconds which after the flashing I would believe to be a very strong attack, but it only is a very often used rotation spell. What I liked about the warrior before legion was that they didn't have huge animations. Now they have, too. And paladins hat a good amount, but now there is yellow glowing just everywhere. They were warriors who fight with the help of the holy light to me. Not ones that always glow yellow and every ability flashy as hell. I can't immerse myself in a world with those spell effects and I just have to say.. If Classic evolves and also gets these effects that are way overdone on my opinion, I don't know if I will be able to play it anymore, too. It just destroys my immersion into the World of warcraft, this cool universe. I like spell effects like the ones from warcraft 3 (original). They are believable. Hunters in retail I can't stand, too. No normal, believable shots anymore. But shot snakes and these things. In a fantasy world of my imagination these modern effects  of retail don't fit. A raid in retail would cause an instant epileptical reaction. It's only flash flash flash anymore and one can't distinguish his own spells anymore.
---
Same tank "guys let me get aggro first! Why you so impatient? "
---
What do you mean you move SLOWER when sneaking??!?!?!/1/1
---
This is fine if your goal is the minimum /played, but it's not going to help you at all getting to 60 in 6 actual days.
---
Hahahahaha
---
I said it will be a fact. I didn't need to specify when. And it's pretty goddamn obvious you're not going to have raid-geared players causing havoc in the first months of the game... 
---
Oh I used... *italics*. **The horror**. I bet I just did triggered you to the equivalent of killing kittens, for using emboldened text, huh?
---
People commonly use italics to emphasize a word that they would emphasize if they were speaking verbally. Pretty sad I need to tell/teach someone that, who isn't a 4-year-old.
---
If you want people to be nicer to you, don't misconstrue someone's argument, and use Straw Man. Most people won't respond too kindly.
---
Pserver mafia
---
Lol, thank you
---
To that same effect though, Everquest was designed mostly around PVE and raiding and they had supporting roles. The big difference I think, and I could be wrong here, is that WoW had soft enrage timers on bosses which is what sets the "strict" dps and healing requirements. You can still design a game around PVE and raiding and have effective support roles.
---
*Time is money, friend!*
---
As a Mage, I better see some gold in that trade window.
---
The definitely got boss armour wrong, and many buffs that stack on private servers wont stack in vanilla.
---
Everyone except for a third of this sub....
---
Fine taste 👌👌
---
Pay to win? How do you mean? They allow you to buy gear &amp; or gold?
---
Lavender mage weave or bust
---
There's really not much else to say. :-) You're welcome.
---
Mage. No question
---
if your priest dies or you have a druid healing, you can have pal/sham resurrect and shave lots of minutes off the dungeon run time.
---
You have literally already been disproven by this video and by what happens on private servers.  "Private Servers are different" is an argument that makes no sense the stuff that happens in private servers has defined the entire vanilla meta
---
Basically, things like mob armor, resistances, and damage values are only known by the server. When you cast a spell on a mob, what happens is your client tells the server you cast Shadowbolt on it, then the server uses the mob's Shadow Resistance value to calculate whether your spell resisted or not behind the scenes and tells you the result. The same goes for pretty much all the mob stats, including health in vanilla (because in vanilla you only see percentage health for unfriendly units).
---
There's some very limited amount of data that's duplicated client-side, and this is what data miners have access to. For the old versions of WoW (TBC and vanilla, which are the only versions I'm familiar with) this includes some spell information and information on player character stats (base stat growth per level and such), as well as some limited amount of information on mobs like the models they're supposed to use, but basically no information on mob stats like armor.
---
In other words, the client data contains pretty much nothing on any of the mobs you see in the world. It's all sent to the client on a need-to-know basis, probably equal parts to save server bandwidth and to make reverse engineering more difficult. And because the game doesn't actually *need* to display mob armor or resistances anywhere for most mobs, these are typically not sent to the client at all. The one exception I can think of to this is the Beast Lore skill that hunters have, which shows many stats including armor and resistances for various Beast type mobs.
---
This goes a bit beyond the point, but the data you *can* see, eg. mob level, name, position in the world, etc. is captured by packet sniffers (a tool that parses and stores the network traffic between the client and the server) to build the databases that private servers use. Because this data doesn't contain much of the necessary information like damage or armor, those were filled in for the most part by using a formula that calculates them from the creature's level. And because resistance values can't be calculated like this, those were mostly just ignored and the few that do exist are based on anecdotal evidence. This makes the data thus produced quite inaccurate.
---
It should be noted that calculating this from the mob's level is not entirely wrong (Blizzard did it too, for the most part), but the formulas that private servers used for this were overly simple and incorrect. Somewhat recently some private server folks actually figured out the real mob damage formula (or a very good approximation of it), and it involves multiple variables besides just the creature's level.
---
Sites like http://classicdb.ch/ then used this private server data to build a Wowhead-like database. So in short, don't trust the values on Classicdb, or pretty much any database site that isn't Wowhead (and Wowhead won't tell you the values because they don't know them).
---
I leave a twink in each bracket just so i always have something to queue BGs with friends, regardless of their level.  Though i dont do the full out engineering twinks, so are they REALLY twinks?  I guess.  They are in dungeon gear.
---
The ads kill it for me.
---
in pvp? HA!
---
the only thing that bugged me about the zone was finding the damned cave entrances when they could be at very different altitudes
---
that's literaly what i was trying to say.
---
I just don't understand how can you compare pros and cons without weights. Or are they all equally weighted to you?
---
They’ve already confirmed realm transfers after phase 2.
---
It keeps you moving. Moving target is harder to hit. Same reason rogues run faster. Everyone knows you run faster with a knife.
---
still gross
---
there's no benefit to it at all no.
---
Why they do it? Idk habits i guess
---
Source? I'd very much like to have her guides as an addon than Questie and such.
---
It isn't meaningless, it conveys different meanings to different people. If it means nothing to you, it's meaningless to you. It means something to me, and thus is meaningful to me. 
---
If it ever means anything to anyone, it is literally meaningful.
---
Because of the AOE farms?
---
Hmm, is there a way to filter for weapon types? As a dagger rogue I am obviously not interested in anything but daggers. If that's not in the tool yet, would it be possible to add?
---
also should be noted, you can use the same vanilla client for any vanilla private server, all that's needed is to change the realmlist.
---
WoW is based on Warcraft 3.
---
Username checks out.
---
I was always glad to hand out summons/healthstones to party members, especially summoning tbh as the whole concept of bringing the player directly to you regardless of distance is something unique in classic and a lot of people appreciate it when they get summoned.
---
As for healthstones, i only used to give it to tanks as others tended to forget and not use it.
---
Possibly due to a habbit from alot of pvp players of straifing during attacks
---
Pause the video where he gives the definition of exploit. 
---
&gt;Not intended by the video game's designers
---
These buffs were a mechanism of the game that weren't removed until after TBC. The developers knew about them and chose to leave them in for the entirety of vanilla's life cycle, in addition to the expansion afterwards. Why wait so long to remove a simple mechanic if it wasn't working as intended. Are flasks exploits because of the advantage they give? 
---
Having or not having these buffs does not make or break the game. If you don't want them, don't get them it's as easy as that. But for guilds that are attempting fast clears/speed runs they should absolutely be available. This is all coming from someone that will rarely, if ever, utilize this game mechanic.
---
hunters are the best overall because the pet makes soling elites easy. warlocks and mages are ok too because of CC but it takes more effort
---
Wow! This is absolutely amazing, the equivalency point feature is so good to have. Thanks for making this :)
---
Free realm transfers to select realms IF needed.
---
I only saw that confirmation.
---
Ah bummer, thanks for the info. That's the sort of quality of life feature I'd be ok with having but I understand that's a slippery slope that leads to the modern game.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1r54f/stuck_between_druid_and_warlock_help_me_decide/).

John Staats WoW Diary. Check it out
---
The melee leeway is either broken or working as intended right now, I am leaning towards broken, essentially if you are moving you get more melee range, this is especially noticeable on Tauren. If your opponent is moving you get even more melee range.
---
I hate playing mainstream classes too. My solution is to play an unconventional race for that class.
---
This is exactly how i'd build a druid for world pvp. Maybe a a little different distribution there and there but you generally have everything covered well.
---
Is it possible it was a warrior hamstring kiting?
---
world record is 4 days/ 20 hours played.
---
Private servers, some people have their routine down to be under 100 hours and the fastest are doing it under 90 hours.  However private servers aren't classic, and they aren't doing those numbers in a classic go live enironment.  However their testing indicates from stress tests and beta testing indicates they are beating those benchmarks in some areas, but other areas, they need to change their route because some optimal leveling spots are sub-par in a massive go-live enfironment.
---
Basically, if you aren't testing your class, build, spec, leveling routes  which quest gives you which garunteed upgrades, with alternates, already then you won't be able to hit 60 in 6 real life days.
---
&gt; It could of been
---
it could've been
---
Joana's guide is about getting to 60 before anyone else on a server. He includes some tips to reduce your /played, but it was never his goal.
---
Yep, that's my man.
---
It’s a group buff
---
He's making a valid connection. Reck bombing was an exploit, and was fixed by Blizzard. Stacking world buffs was removed as well, the only difference is it happened later; patch 2.1.0. You cannot claim world buffs are not an exploit without also claiming things like reck bombing weren't as well. The whole #nochanges thing doesn't make much sense because the game has changed so much over time. If you want the game exactly as it was in 1.12 that's fine, but exploits like world buff stacking existed back then, and will exist in Classic if it exactly mirrors that time point. Denying that is being intentionally dishonest.
---
You will have to know what quest chains to skip. In a speedrun you will be unable to complete elite quests and dungeon quests as those take time to find a group to finish. You will have to have mapped out ahead of time the exact questing path and practiced it a few times before doing it seriously. On a new server you will not have a main to funnel items to quickly level like potions, weapons and gold. There are certain talents you must choose, spells you learn and other that you skip, and you most likely would not choose a class that had a lot of class quests. So it probably something that you will not be able to do, leveling takes forever for the average person in vanilla compared to retail. It can take a person who has done it a few times anywhere between 10-16 days /played for a normal playthrough which includes elite quests, class quests and instance runs.

You didn't just provide your opinion about what you prefer. You're calling what other people prefer, "boring", and that that they're wrong and that they should find Always On pvp fun. 
---
You sound like a dictatorial douchebag that doesn't understand that other people have preferences. Yep, it's a game. Is that an argument, or supposed to mean something?  You sound like a whiny bitch for complaining about people who want to be on a pve server.
---
Yep, it's one of the few things I'd say is bad about Vanilla... the pet system is unfinished. Some pet families get unique skills while others are screwed =(
---
spell power ret babyy
---
you might do better with a lower back support office chair.  like officechairs.com, HON, or officechairusa.com or wayfair or somewhere like that.
---
Spell down rank solves that issue. On my pserver aq geared warlock my rank 4 shadow bolt costs 100 mana and hits over 1k with full consumes
---
Certainly not ideal, but I'll put up with some shortcomings in a tanks personality if he's really good at his job. Your point is well taken though.
---
True but either way you're still going to annoy the shit out of the caster with a 1.2 pet. Obviously BT is bis for pet but it's not a huge deal and the effort spent trying to tame him on release is probably not worth it.
---
Quiz is pretty easy if you've played the game since vanilla also for the last question yes there is 12 professions 9 primary and 3 secondary but you wrote tailoring in there twice and missed alchemy but I'd give the video an 8/10 otherwise.
---
Honestly, with leering I don't think we will have queue times so to speak. 3k ppl each layer and maybe 4-5 layers. Not the worst :)
---
most people can't even hit 60 in 6 days /played (actual logged in time) nevermind 6 days playing 7-10 hours a day. most likely it will take you around 12-15 days /played time but this depends on the class you choose as well
---
This is for pvp. Please read the caption before you comment. Monster slaying is practically useless for pvp. Efficiency is also not necessary whereas imp conc shot is.
---
FD -&gt; shadowmeld -&gt; aimed shot &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stoneform
---
That would go against the TOS and get you banned.
---
At least it's not a chance.
---
Who said anything about serpent sting? :O
---
This server made more money in the time it was active than some of you will make in a lifetime.
---
Was rated 2350 in TBC and, had a 29 hunter twink. Some times them pig shoots is just fun. Had an AB where I went 119-0. It was fun on a bun.
---
Ohhh I tried to  block those out......
---
I mean most guilds do ZG, ony, BWL. The heads do sort of magically appear in bags lol. So its wating time to use the heads you got from raid, before raid? Is it not more wasted time to not use the head, hence wasting the buff?
---
You can not farm consumes if you dont want to? Idk I have fun playing this game. I make money each week and spend some on consumes. I dont expect everyone to have consumes. But I like using them, so I do. I dont think its wasted time because its fun for me. Usually guilds start casual and dont use consumes. Then one person happens to use them because you recruited someone a bit more try hard. He wrecks the dps meter and all of a sudden everyone wants to be like him. 
---
You say you dont want to use consumes, but you probably do want to compete on the dps meter. If you dont, thats fine too. But most ppl like trying to do better.
---
The login servers will still queue people.
---
I used alakazam xD
---
I, too, can get 40+ Killing blows with my resto druid in WSG.  Hence why I never need to roll a twink as a dps class to get more class pvp diversity as I also have infinite time on my hands to deck out several 60's.
---
...oh wait.
---
the WR is 4 days, 20 hrs, 49 minutes of /played
---
So.... technically what you want to do is possible as long as you play 19.5 hrs a day for each of the 6 days. 
---
This would leave you 4.5 hrs a day to eat and sleep.
---
It would also require that the game is playable at the very start of your first day - which may not be the case depending on your timezone/server issues.
---
It also requires you to be the absolute best leveler ever.
---
Here's Joana's detailed write-up on her speedrun:  https://www.furiouspaul.com/wow/
---
You are being extremely sensationalist with anyone that disagrees with your opinion. You should probably not play classic if the presence of world buffs causes you this much stress.
---
They're not just doing it against players. They do it against NPCs as well.
---
&gt;smoothbrains
---
That's a new one - whats the origin of that word?
---
This guy Classics
---
Oh really? Didn’t think they would come down that hard on it. 
---
I remember changing the sound of the hunter rifle so it was silenced. I was wondering if the same method would work for models etc?
---
Druids? Really? I know their travel forms are awesome but I would have assumed Hunters at higher levels would be better for elite farming.
---
Because as someone who enjoys pvp I have time to fully deck out several 60's...
---
It's funny, I saw a lot of complaining about early Cata difficulty on forums and such, but in my actual random PUGs they went over smoothly the majority of attempts. 
---
I can't remember if I used lfm or got people from my own server though.
---
You can kite mobs to cancel their swing timers. Arms warriors hamstring kite a lot.
---
ok that was what I as assuming. Just old habit.
---
It used to be a trend to downvote any private server favoritism a couple of month ago, I'm not sure if it's because of private servers themselves being hated or just the private server elitism that came from it.
---
I to would like to play the normal beta.
---
Common blizzard throw me a bone here please :(
---
I swapped out all Male Troll models, textures, and animations for the Dwarf ones. Never got banned or suspended.
---
at 49 with mail, and stormstrike they do equally as good.  But its also much harder to get 49 bis gear.
---
Ele shamans also becomes power houses at 49.
---
I had the same feeling for Shaman. I loved Elemental Shaman in WotLK. I came back in MoP and played that character because my friends were on Horde and it was my only Horde character above 50, but I gave up shortly after I hit 90 because neither Elemental nor Resto were very engaging to play and I couldn't be bothered to re-gear or level another character to try to find fun.
---
Holy hell man. Stay on your pve server.  Relax
---
I was as tryhard as they come in t3 gear and I still wore my lvl shirt for troll pride
---
This is what I'm going through right now and let me tell you... It can get stressful.
---
I so badly want to raid with my 2-3 great friends because I love them to death, so I do raid with them... But there are some raiders they refuse to replace because "They're family" and it just hurts my heart lol!
---
There's a healer in our guild... A druid... She's been a druid since Wrath of the Lich King... Just found out her Cat form increases her speed....................?????????? And says she can't cast dispel when she's moving.............................????????????????????????????
---
But I just try to stay positive and get them pumped up about killing bosses. I told her she CAN in fact dispel while moving(my main is a druid healer that has no raid group but clears every week,) but she keeps saying she can't. I'm wondering if there's an addon messing her up...
---
Either way... It can get frustrating because when I bring things up like "Hey, here's the damage taken from all the orbs flying around on Rastakhan, let's try to reduce that." They instantly think I'm singling the top dmg taken people out and get upset and then tell me I shouldn't post that kind of stuff...................................????????????????? Like, they don't want to get better....
---
In Warlords of Draenor we wiped to Butcher Heroic... 2nd boss.... for 7 weeks because DPS was too low and they don't replace people. :S
---
But... At least I get to raid with my friends. :)
---
They look like signs for amusement park rides. I love it!
---
Is a prot pala not a top farmer? Planned to level one for that sole purpose
---
&gt; I played BfA for about a month and my char is ~ilvl340, where leveling gear gave like... 200?
---
At 120, it's something like 268. 110 greens are 225.
---
Exactly. I’ll summon you if I’m there with the other two and I see you making an effort to at least be there. But if you just stop trying to get to the destination and do duck all because you see a lock in the group? Get the duck out of here with that bullshit, I don’t even understand where that entitlement comes from.
---
People seem to forget the sheer time investment got get half devent gear with another 60 if they like to pvp with more than one class..
---
The "battles" of this "war" happen at Southshore/TM, cities, battlegrounds, etc. These are actual battles.
---
What you're talking about is dueling against neckbeards who, like many posters have alluded to, are just bitter about getting ganked themselves. 
---
You can RP about actual war and how important you are to whatever cause you're play-fighting for, but don't expect others to buy into your fantasy.
---
I disagree somewhat. 
---
(R14 vanila paladin, i had t2 and t3 i couldn't have 2.5 due to priority looting in my guild i forgot but maybe i had 1/5 2.5 set by the end of vanila) 
---
Gear wise you are right it will be very hard to get gear for most players as it could be that you wont be alowed to bid on the dps gear. 
---
So you are right there. But unstopable force is easy choice. I remember i PVPed with Herald of Woe from BWL which is decent mace and had good success with it before i got two handed weapons from R14. 
---
**Regarding holy spec.** 
---
I played it, it is ok but it is nowhere near strong like well geared retri paladin.   
---
Obvious advantage is that you can actually heal way better so there is that. 
---
You need ZHC and tablet from MC to make it shine. Its very hard to get those as hard as i would say to get asscandy and similar weapons, as two handed weapons might be used mainly by warriors but ZHC and ToEP is used by mages locks druids and other healers. 
---
**Some pro tips:**
---
Seal twisting with seal of justice was just broken but you had to know how to do it (you could judgement on the stun that procs for extra dmg and other pro stuff). 
---
I hope that you know that SOC rank 1 was best seal due to low mana that it used, great thing is that unlike with shaman weapon enchantments you could swap weapons around and still have seal up so weapon swapping was super important .  
---
That was crucial against mana burns from hunters and priests as skilled priests would go for that strategy against retri paladins (with dispels) but skilled paladins would counter that with rank1 flash of light heals and rank1 seal twists with random rank1 buffs on top of that (bom rank 1). 
---
Also you had to know how to seal twist with other seals for extra mana and life and to swap to quick one hand and a shield when needed. 
---
I forgot the numbers as i hadn't played since 2009 but SOC proc with seal twist into seal of light was some super nice heals and SOC seal twist into wisdom was also very good. 
---
Now one last thing. 
---
Blessing of sacrifice rank 1 was superb in battlegrounds and very strong but nobody used it and it is very unknown even today. 
---
You could put that on random friendly and it would tick on you for something laughable (20 dmg or so) but it would take you out of poly, seduction etc with BOF it would make you unstoppable vs mage and such.
---
On top of that you had cast baiting with flash of light just like casters do and swing timers and movement and other things that other melee classes had to deal with which is not easy to master. 
---
There are also plethora of other small things to think about but i just forgot most of them which i will have to relearn once vanila comes out... 
---
**Paladins are super easy mode if you want to play them on casual or mid tier level but just like all the other classes small things makes you great and matter a lot and that is why vanila was so great.** 
---
**What i want to say you had plenty of average paladins and it might look like it is simple but actually there is crazy depth involved with every class.**
---
Not better at developing MMOs apparently.
---
yup =) druids can solo some bosses in BRD (spider boss for example), hunters cannot.
---
nah face tanking mobs and just strafing on attacks.
---
I didn't *miss* (omg!!) anything. It just literally doesn't need to be said when it's immediately obvious that that won't be the case early on. 
---
I'm just saying what a lot of people know how it will turn out, and they don't want to deal with that shit when they make a new character.  Duh.
---
I'm not angry, sorry. Unlike yourself, I don't get all worked up when someone disagrees with me. More projection on your part. Odd that you assume anyone not agreeing with you must be angry. Maybe you should talk to a therapist.  That's a really weird, and immature, reaction.
---
Enhancement as it's called, is 2hand and it can work in pvp but it's not the best. It's mostly a fun RNG spec since you can get lucky and just oneshot people.
---
For raiding it's almost never used.
---
Ret is only good vs average players.
---
If my memory is right, you have only one window of opportuny to kill a good player in equivalent gear as a ret paladin. This player must have no way to remove your HoJ, which means you often have to wait your 2nd HoJ to get the kill because of pvp trinket. For exemple, you have no chance against a lock because he can just devour magic your HoJ and you have no way to kick his fear.
---
Here is the super secret formula : get the guy to "possible one shot status" which is about 80% hp and without absorb shields. One good Seal of Command proc with a crit in there should do it.  Then right after that swing &gt; HoJ &gt; Judge &gt; SoC &gt; Swing once or twice before HoJ ends &gt; Repentance before your target can cast any instant spells like a shield/death coil &gt; Wait the full duration of repentance to reset swing and judgement cooldown &gt; Judge &gt; SoC &gt; Swing &gt; Bubble/Trinket CCs if you have still have them &gt; Execute with Hammer of Wrath. If anything goes wrong, like you get CC, your target gets healed, no SoC proc, no crit, then your target will live and easily reset or turn around the fight.
---
I always found it harder to navigate that one. Looks like they got gobbled up by WoWHead also :(
---
To be fair though, if you do all of the level appropriate dungeons while leveling, and don't get too screwed by the RNG, you're a real fucking beast as a warrior.
---
And (from my experience on private servers at least), warriors have the greatest potential of all classes when you completely dungeon level them, as they scale better from gear than any other class.
---
I hear world of hellokitty is nice.
---
Did anyone get the WoW tabard from doing that? Male Night Elf Rogue got it on my server.  Not sure who got it on horde side.
---
Hey you may get away with it im just saying its against the TOS and is a bannable offense.
---
This is my goal, MC raiding inside 60 days.  I don’t really want or need to go faster than that when I plan 2 years of play.
---
I was maining a healing priest since woltk. I think about going (prot) warrior, because I like melee combat and hate caster damage and levelling will be a huge part of vanilla:/
---
It was a placeholder "generic damage spell".
---
Level squish is next expansion. And retail is way too far gone, level squish does jack all for the game. What wow needs is an entirely new revamped game like wow2 but obviously dont call it wow2.
---
This man knows
---
Full Tier 0.5
---
Clear MC, ZG, AQ20, Onyxia
---
Max 2 Professions
---
yea maybe that'd be good if you were fighting a literal target dummy not gonna lie.
---
Actually this. Been waiting for 10 years. Gonna be the longest two weeks of my life, followed by the three shortest.
---
No -- reddit has spoken, only noobz make twinks and there are zero valid reasons to twink.
---
Duel wielding is not in classic. As far as viability, enhance is ok with pvp and rarely used in raids. You would need to be Resto to raid.
---
I could say the same about all the PvE server players who have started threads on the official forums over the years trying to change the PvP system and going so far as to try to impose these ideas on PvP realms as well. I've seen these people try to armchair diagnose PvPers with serious mental disorders like psychopathy because they don't play the game the way they want them to.
---
It goes both ways. The WoW fanbase in general is entitled and whiny.
---
The highest achievement right now is for 400 but there are people with over 500
---
I was always warned from my guild it was full of viruses and nasty shit like that.
---
Lol that DOES seem to happen a lot in my experience but I don't mind. Helps keep my awareness and reaction time sharp. I also believe it's 100% my job to get away from frozen mobs if the mage needs to nova suddenly. I'll never get upset at a mage for that. But others mileage may vary.
---
&gt; I'm not angry, sorry. Unlike yourself, I don't get all worked up when someone disagrees with me.   
---
&gt; Maybe you should talk to a therapist. That's a really weird, and immature, reaction. 
---
Hmmm still wondering where I got that idea lol
---
Take info you get with acceptance instead of tears, the only advice I can give someone clearly as lost as you &gt;.&lt;
---
1-2 mil probably
---
#Bullshit. 
---
In Classic, anyone can twink. It's really not that expensive, you're not having to collect rare vintage shit or spend thousands of gold in heirlooms (I don't know what the twink meta in modern retail looks like, just a guess). The most expensive stuff would be I imagine Crusader? I think Crusader was the most meta weapon enchant but I'm not 100% sure on that, a bit pricey but not back-breaking.
---
Meanwhile, PvP at level cap is largely defined by how fat and greasy you are IRL, how many times you skipped showering, how many times you didn't go to the gym, because "raid or die" or "play 16 hours a day for 3 months straight" are the only ways to be competitive in PvP. I know it all too well, I lived that shit, I was one of those greasy sweaty bois. There's some skill, but gear is a large part of it. It only gets worse as the phases gone on as well - Phase 6 will be more degenerate of a meta than twinks all things considered. 
---
TL;DR: Anyone can twink. If you want to BG at low levels, twinking is part of the game. Twinking is approachable, high-end level 60 PvP is not.
---
I switched from Horde PvP to Alliance PvE in late TBC. Because I made so many new friends (and am still in contact with them today) I can't say that overall I regret it, I had a really good time.
---
But Horde and PvP servers are both my preference for sure. I definitely missed the danger lurking around every corner and the added conflict and rivalry. I still view the PvE option as the carebear option, but I was still able to make the most of it.
---
If all you do is wPvP then you're probably gonna have a bad time, though. People do flag up and do camp quest hubs to drum up some PvP but if all you want to do is wPvP you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Even though it looks like we got EU cucked once again, I can see why they left us out since our peak hours are not during Blizzard's active work hours so they wont have any control/monitoring over our servers.
---
OH WHO AM I KIDDING, WHAT THE FUCK WHY DID THEY LEAVE US OUT I WASTED A GODDAMN FUCKING TOKEN WAITING FOR A BETA INVITE I MEAN COME ON BEEN PLAYING SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FUCKING SIX ILL HAVE YOU KNOW I GRADUATED  TOP OF MY CLASS  SPECIALIZING IN ARMS COMBAT I STILL REMEMBER THE DAY I GOT THE UNSTOPPABLE FORCE AND LAID WASTE TO ALTERAC VALLEY AND WON THE BATTLE THAT DAY
---
Deus Vox? or IE? We do if you're from either of those.
---
&gt;In most cases you're right, however there are people who are good at pvp who roll a twink for some ~~diversity~~ seal clubbing.
---
I think you'll have to wait a couple phases for it, but absolutely go do the Rhok'delar bow quest. It will absolutely test your limits and help improve your playing, and the bow will last you FOREVER.
---
&gt; plus the leather is showing signs of wear
---
LOL
---
Sometimes it is as DPS/healing backup/emergency aggro control/healtank.

it doesnt, because it shouldnt

**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server - Early Weeknight Raids! (Tu, W, Th 7p-10p EST)**
---
**Introduction**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
**Member Expectations**
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are building a community of like minded, mature players to enjoy Classic WoW and now is the time to join us!
---
We have leadership roles available for qualified individuals (Raid Lead/Officer).
---
**Strong demand for committed Restoration Druids!**
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Heal)
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Rogue
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

I don’t think it takes hours to get a few buffs. The video is describing a situation where people get all the world buffs and then log off until the raid starts. 
---
Just to clarify I’m all for keeping things as they were in Classic. Keep the world buffs in the game and let them be used in raids. The video is arguing that world buffs should be removed upon zoning into a raid.
---
39 was so much fun as a twink rogue, I also did 20-29 on the way up but rogues were too powerful in that bracket.
---
easily 1 million, potentially multimillion
---
:o  never got anything bad from it.. used it about 500 times a day xD
---
Yeah, from what I remember about shammies they were decent healers but pretty average damage. I’m mostly just thinking like for dungeons as DPS. I’d probably be better off doing heals for dungeons though.
---
As a raid leader I would tell people to walk if they were being lazy enough to bank on summons without a good reason.
---
Let's not pretend that humans weren't dicks to each other before horde showed up.  I mean shit the northern human countries didnt even give a fuck when the fel horde wiped out the kingdom of stormwind and they only did something once the horde showed up on their doorsteps
---
This depends on who you ask.
---
Do you like healing? You might like Paladin.
---
Do you dislike healing? Don't play a Paladin.
---
They're one of the slower classes to level, even as ret, but very powerful healers.
---
I agree, if I know about getting forced at level 60, I'll just camp at level 59 and farm the living shit out of resources until I can cap BSing and Engineering and profit like crazy. It should be 30+ or so. Or honestly just not use layering and let players suffer, it'll at least be a memorable experience even if it's not a very streamlined leveling experience.
---
Hey, it's me. Ur healer!

Very true all they needed was hit. No parry, dodge, or glance OP NERF HUNTERS.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!
---
**Youtube:** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvbut2LBKywSOiy_ZOnAJg&gt;   (World PvP Fights, etc.)
---
**How to join?**
---
Join our discord and i will reach out to you: https://discord.gg/STNp9aM
---
Or because it’s fun?
---
Yeah my rogue was named stabu and he honestly ran most of the BG’s he was in. I even saw people on the forums asking for something to be done about him lol
---
Hots dont stack till tbc :)
---
I’m actually been enjoying BFA recently. 8.2 should keep me entertained til Classic. 
---
Not sure if you are max level or not but just do every quest you see, and gear up from dungeons and world quests
---
Now you have me interested in droods my dude.
---
Easily 1 Million.
---
Well you did respond to him in a pretty annoying manner. He basically said he wasted a ton of time trying to get around gankers, and you responded by suggesting he should waste a ton of time later on helping others get around gankers. Either way the problem isn't solved, and your solution is quite possibly the worst solution available other than handing the ganker his account info and giving up.
---
That would be the plan yes!
---
Anyone about to play should know we probably won't get onto a server.
---
I have the same issue :(
---
Dude this guy is actually insanely mad lol.
---
I've got /petattack macro'd to my main lock spells to get my wrathguard out the gate a bit faster. 
---
Many a time has Kizgorath pulled a group of mobs that I accidentally tabbed on to. Many a time has the healer rightfully let me die in my own stupidity.
---
lol, even if you used one every day in a year , you still would not be able to use all your mounts in a year...  I will never understand the collector's mind,  I would decline every mount over 10, even if they were completely free.
---
**Guild : &lt;**TBD (In the process of picking the name... Input in the Discord would be appreciated!)
---
**Faction :** Alliance  
---
**Server :** PVP  
---
**About Us :** I was the GM and raid leader of an alliance guild on thunderhorn for the first year in Vanilla before we switched to horde on Garona.   We were a top 3 guild on the server.  We have done the hardcore thing and a majority of us have careers, wives/husbands , children, etc.  We are looking to progress at a decent pace without no-lifing the game or getting divorced lol.  We will raid at max 3 nights a week, will do a lot of PvP as well as guild events.  We have the experience in our officer core to get stuff done.
---
**Loot System :** Its a hybrid DKP system.  Its in the discord.  If our guild sounds like something you are interested in, click the discord link at the bottom of this post and come check out the DKP channel and ask any questions you have.  Its the best loot system you will find and its not even close.
---
**Raiding :** As noted in the About Us section, we will progress pretty quickly due to our knowledge of the raids as a whole.  Been there done that.  We probably cleared MC / BWL over 50 times each , AQ40 about 10 times.  Nax, I cleared 8 bosses while some of the officers cleared the full zone.  After we secure our needed classes, we won't mind people playing an off-spec here and there either as long as they play it at a decent clip.
---
**Expectations :** This is where we differ from almost every other guild you will find.  We aren't trying to go nuts.  Vanilla isn't rocket science.  We won't be trying to no-life it and won't hold you to those expectations.  All we ask is when we do raid, show up ready to go.  Give it your best and have fun.  Do this + follow the simple guild rules and we will be one of the best guilds on the server.
---
**Rules :** Pretty simple.  Don't be an ass to other guildies.  Don't be an ass to others on the server.  Be helpful to guildmates.  Be mature.  Don't make the guild look bad.  Pretty much if any of these rules are broken its the deuces for you.  We are a no drama guild.  Period.

---
Not today, Ser Davos.
---
He’s def mad af about something
---
I see so much potential in classic, I'm not surprised if 3-5 million of the old players that quit will try 1-3 months. Maybe it will stabilize around 1,5-2m
---
ALL OF THEM
---
It’s a lot to unpack here. First off I’m in the beta but I’ve never played private servers. I have watched a lot of content from folks who have though. 
---
While hard cores will be hitting max on week one. Most of the player base will either quit or take a few months before hitting max. 
---
Even so I started doing south shore PvP in my 40s. Yeah I’d get 2 hit by 60s but I still had fun. I think a large number of people are going to take their time to hit 60. The servers aren’t going anywhere. No need to rush. 
---
I will be no lifeing a warrior to max on week one but it’s cause I am taking a full week off work to vacation in Classic. The wife and I are going to both play and eat junk food for a week. I’m super stoked for it. But after that I plan on playing a few hours most nights and raiding 1 maybe 2 nights a week. 
---
I think there will be a lot of casual guilds of folks in there 30s. Think about how long it will take a guild to full clear Naxx if they only play let’s say 5 hours of raiding each week? That’s to say that a guild like that will even keep 40ish players playing each week for that long. 
---
Retention of players will be a big deal specially when Naxx guilds start poaching for 4H.
---
I don't mind people reserving stuff, providing it's at the start and not any nonsense like announcing it on the boss pull. I did it myself in vanilla on DM Tribute runs, I was forming the groups though.
---
What I hope does NOT come back is the whole "oh I'm just offspeccing, my main is X" as a carte blanche to roll on say tank items when playing as "DPS" - I lost skullflame shield off a trash mob in UBRS due to this and I am still salty when I think about it.
---
Enhancement Shamans were basically the same as Ret Paladins.
---
Ret - this is your entire rotation: seal of command, judgement of command, recast seal of command, and pray for seal of command procs.
---
Enhancement shaman: drop windfury totem, stormstrike, shock, pray for windfury procs.
---
However, in a raid, you wouldn't use stormstrike and shocks immediately off cooldown because you would run out of mana before the fight was over.  You would only use them freely when the boss was under 20% and you would prioritize refreshing windfury totem for your group over your own damage since your damage was pure ass regardless.
---
Check out the [classic late night subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight/), I'm also searching for a late night raiding guild and I made a listing of the ones I found.
---
By January, probably 250k.
---
We had a level 19 rogue who had a similar situation in vanilla until she fell off the zep and discovered the cove outside Org on the coast and dinged to 20 lol, we're talking absolute 100% BiS too and got abuse on forums.
---
Lolret
---
Easy: clothies
---
At least 3
---
Alliance wins AV strictly because of map advantages
---
Yeah I'm looking forwards to not being allowed in 5 mans due to being a paladin because sweaty try hards think they'll get done 5 min faster if they take anyone else.
---
Going to laugh when these retail players either get ignored or cluster in their own cliques as most of the classic community just has fun because it doesnt matter if you're not doing progression raiding.
---
Best addon ever.
---
It would, but people still did and still do. Not really the point though.
---
I have an EU account and the Beta and Stress test jus reappeared in my launcher.
---
Is this some sort of mistake, or...?
---
It’s sad and disgusting really.
---
That'd just require a really big guild to have that many geared characters to pull raiders from.
---
I'm totally fine with some 60 killing lowbies of the opposite faction as they run by.  I agree with you though, that 60s camping level 20s is the height of being an asshole.  You're deriving your fun purely from causing frustration for others who don't even stand a chance.
---
It's always amazing in online games when someone feels the need assert their dominance (camping, t-bagging, trash talking) when they're playing a character/class/whatever that should dominate you.  It's like if pro sports team played your local high school, ran up the score, and then trash talked about bad the high school was.  No shit you won, but have some god damn class.
---
Could use a lot more of you in the community. Luckily it takes patience to excel at Classic so these kinds of people will be moving things forward.
---
I love watching streamers on Twitch, but never understood people using emotes in other contexts. 
---
both "gg" or even "lol" actually mean something. but "poggers"? why would anyone type "poggers" if it doesn't show up as an actual image emote in the chat?
---
I definitely will. I’m going to be playing with some IRL friends in their guild, and we have lots of fun. I just wanna make sure I’m not like...cutting my damage in half with an enhancement shammy. I can always respec for raids, too, so I’m not too worried.
---
I literaly was just pointing out something to supplement his argument and he lost his lid. Wasent even saying he was wrong, just saying it won't happen for a little bit.
---
haha, his wife bangs Orcs
---
This. Exactly.
---
I'm kinda curious as to why you thought that would work?
---
Tree fitty. (Thousand)
---
It varies depending on phase. Hunter soloing DM:N is very profitable when dire maul gets released. Mages aoe'ing crocs when ZG is out. 
---
I would consider mages to be overall best farming class not taking phases into consideration. Simply because of their AoE farm abilities.
---
Me too brother! My boss asked why I needed 2 weeks off and I just said personal reasons, but it's important lmao
---
Only blizzard was perfectionist that attempted that. Activision don't give no F's and sticks to the schedule.
---
I subbed 2 days ago because I figured while I'm getting hyped for Classic I might as well see the leveling content in WoD, Legion and BFA which is supposedly the best part of any of them.
---
Score.
---
Very nice! Thank you much!
---
looks cozy!  love it.
---
If you want to switch region I suppose but I already subscribed foolishly for a chance at the beta, I am not going to pay for 2 days of stress test.  I also don't have the bfa extension and cannot be bothered by whatever game I would have access to without.
---
And? They used to servers to run their illegally obtained intellectual property and got more than just server money in donations.
---
Doesn't exactly sound right, considering they only opened for a payment option directly to their server through their official source. They never had any private donation option?
---
Will trueshot stack with blessing of might?

System of a Down, Juno Reactor, VNV Nation, Rammstein.
---
It's just the map API that's changed (breaking), plus a Lua upgrade (from it's initial release), so much can be search-n-replaced to work for 1.13.2 :) The built-in guides are based off of Joana's. There are a bunch of forks around and it was first released early TBC, hence guide-wise it's should be very helpful.
---
From what I remember They make less gold per hour than hunters but can farm 2-3x more farming locations than hunters can (which makes them better overall).
---
I think it's really the most shit bracket. JUST no lv20 skills and absolute shit party most of the time. Ehhhh~~
---
Facts. Entire guilds were formed around a few awesome players who didnt mind lifting up others. These people had the epics to show their epeen and it meant something.
---
Because they have families and lives.
---
I just remember attacking the crossroads and fighting a shaman who came to defend it. His heals took forever to cast, so I killed him a few times before he got some backup and I got annihilated. He may not have been specced tho, to be fair.
---
I was a Warrior Tank during Vanilla. I will be either a Priest or Pally healer this time around.
---
Blizzards lunch
---
What’s the difference between real and in game time?
---
Are you being cheeky? It's a great gun for hunters. +1% crit AND some HP. I used it til I got Rhok'delar. 💪
---
You're right. I mixed my words up, the longer cast times leaves MORE time for error.
---
Exactly this
---
Well too bad. They committed intellectual property crime and should be happy they weren't sued for all the money that got donated to them, since that is entirely within Activisions rights.
---
Yes! Exactly this.
---
I'm worried. I'm worried that everyone will shout at the ret paladin to respec and that he's trash. I'm worried that everyone will laugh at people wearing full D1 matching set because it's "not optimal". 
---
Even sooner, I'm worried people will fucking complain in low level dungeons if you roll need on something that is "not your BiS for this level". All this talk about "lvl 30 meta" and "new BiS sets" gets me anxious about how newcomers and "noobs" will get treated. Especially seeing how toxic this sub can get.
---
People have been strafing for a long time without any useful reason for it.  Why not I guess
---
Depends entirely on what you consider a waste of time. 
---
At the end of the day - the game ends. You’ll end up as far as you want to go in raiding and competitive PvP.  When that time comes, to me, at least on a PvP server you can commit to an and alive and dangerous world. That is fun to me and not a waste of time. My example was just something he could do that could be fun and help combat those “gankers” he hates so much instead of hiding away on a safe server where he’s untouchable. 
---
Just takes all the fun out of it. I certainly did not react like a little child - as he did - to not only me - but others here as well. 
---
Again - to take such insult from me simply saying that normal servers were boring just screams insecurity. Lol
---
Week one Rag kill seems very unlikely.....  You would need to get everyone to 60 then clear MC in greens/blues within 7 real days.  That would be the epitome of no lifing it.  Even with every person doing 18-20 hours played each day, that still seems really unlikely.
---
The Scarlet Crusade always had some of the best lore. They were a wasted opportunity in end game vanilla wow. I even thought they could have been used more effectively in WoTLK too. What a shame.
---
hunters can just farm maraudon and dire maul and make 100g/h, no?
---
This was always my argument too
---
You could add a link to a patreon for donation support. Not sure it's enough but it's more than you're set up with now
---
It's residual from PvP interactions for me, I can't speak for another player.
---
Wouldn't that logic apply to people who grind rank 14 or get bis raid gear and beat less geared people. Most people just enjoy the process of researching and maximizing a character at a level bracket. I really don't understand the seething around twinking.
---
no matter what chair i get i always end up sitting the same way.  left leg up on the seat of the chair, leaned forward, chin on knee.  it's weird.  i can't train myself to sit any differently but it's fucked, especially for long play sessions haha.
---
Yeah, it's two stretches of cable with one junction, but that's nothing compared to the multiple junctions between the West Coast and mainland Europe.
---
But that's actually not the reason why.   
---
The reason is more simple. Oceania cannot play on EU servers, so they'll play on NA servers. Allowing them in the stress test is simply accepting the reality of what traffic they'll experience.
---
How do you prevent your twink gaining exp?
---
my bad, i automatically subtracted one day since its coming out Aug 26th in the US.
---
Agreed!
---
Relaunch of Vanilla was asked for on the official forums about a zillion times. It was very clear that there were a lot of player interested in playing Vanilla again with or without Nost.
---
Yeah idk what the hell his problem is but he’s furious lol
---
getting quite neckish, thank you
---
50k, maybe.
---
Except it might have been years later before Blizzard did it of their own initiative. Supposedly they were already working on classic internally, but who knows what state it was in or if it was given any priority at all. Not to mention higher-ups in the company like Ion clearly had an anti-Classic sentiment at the time of Nost. 
---
It would probably have happened eventually without them, but Nostalrius absolutely lit a fire under Blizzard. I don't think they anticipated anywhere near the fallout that happened as a result of the Nostalrius shutdown. It's the only time I've ever seen PR spin out of Blizzard's control like a wildfire.
---
I'll head over and try to save your karma cheers!
---
Did you say farm gold or did you not read his original post? which one is it guy my time is valuable
---
As a Vanilla Druid, it hella annoying to have parts of my kit disabled at random times. Can't talk to the NPC or interact with anything while in forms? Can't root things or run fast indoors? And where's my non-battle rez?
---
It all adds up to be annoying enough for me to shelve Druid until TBC Classic.
---
i think it was T&amp;E who put it perfectly Classic wont be able to recreate how shit you were at the game. 
---
That and how much harder/complex boss fights have gotten over the years compared to what we had in Classic people are going to be disappointed  at the "difficulty" that people hyped Classic up to be
---
4 million subs at the end of the third month? You are insane my friend. There's not even 4 million people playing MMOs in the entire market at this point IIRC (between WoW, FFXIV, Guild Wars 2, ESO). Every single person currently playing an MMO could switch and not hit your guess. 
---
His number seems more correct than yours. If I were a betting man, at the 3-month mark I would expect Classic to sit around 400k +/- 200k (giving myself a lot of wiggle room to be sure, but I think that's a fair margin considering Shadowbringers and patch 8.2 are on the horizon and we don't know how those will alter the perception of the landscape - interest may die down quite a bit when two big MMO drops hit ahead of Classic's launch). I expect it to dip into the 100-200k range around the 12 month mark.
---
Hahaha it’s all good man. Cheers!
---
That would be just more players than stress test can handle
---
Oh, I missed that you were EU.  Feelsbadman.
---
I’d prefer to donate than being forced to watch ads
---
Or Gurubashi Arena
---
There are definitely some bugs due to the entire game having to be adapted. But to the point, the "meta" that the private servers had may be entirely inaccurate or incorrect when classic reaches endgame.
---
Defensive powerhouse. Capable of saving yourself/allies multiple times, both in pvp and dungeons. Great fun in random world pvp, I got ganked many times, and could often turn the tables, which would be harder to do as most other classes.
---
Great for running into Orgrimmar and bubblehearthing.
---
Top farmer for what? They sure farm broken shields allt.
---
Mage for life. Accept no substitutes. 
---
Honestly though, I've seriously considered trying something different but then I realize that there is a reason that Mage has remained my main in every expansion since vanilla. I have had raiding alts of almost every class at various times in my WoW career but Mage has always been my primary focus. There is no reason that should change for Classic WoW. 
---
If I went with anything else it would almost certainly lead to disappointment.
---
It'l probably get a couple million from China alone.
---
Enhancement is like ret in serious pvp, a meme and cannot win 1v1s against most classes by default.
---
Vs scrubs it's fun tho. 
---
Don't play enhancement unless you want to be severely disappointed.
---
It's fine to PW:S a warrior tank once they have threat if they need the big instant "heal" it provides.  A living tank has more threat than a dead one.
---
That said, definitely don't use PW:S before a pull, or shortly thereafter, or you will cause early rage and threat issues.  If the tank is dying that quickly, there are other problems to be solved.
---
People did world PvP in vanilla because it was fun in and of itself, and they're going to do it again in classic.
---
Every forum post asking for Vanilla, every private server Blizz became aware of, every screenshot and video posted online. Everything contributed to Blizzard finally caving. Nost was just one small part of the whole and fanboys seem to think Classic wouldn't have happened without it, which is dumb.
---
Exactly 33.34 thousands, repeating of course
---
&gt; Ret - this is your entire rotation: seal of command, judgement of command, recast seal of command, and pray for seal of command procs.
---
Huh? Shouldn't that be Seal of the Crusader, Judgment, Seal of Command?
---
I have a pretty nice rig with a fairly good connection and having wowhead running in the background makes my PC lag to no end. Heaven forbid I open a SECOND wowhead tab..
---
The word not present in my definition is "talent".
---
TBC was the golden age of Paladin tanks in 5m content. So unique! So fun! I remember my healers being really dubious that I could pull everything and live but once they trusted me, I got constant messages to come tank. 
---
Ditto the golden age of holy priest. 
---
I don't know if I'll play classic since one time doing AQ40/Naxx is enough but if they do progressive expansions I am all the way there.
---
I will have to look into this when Classic is released. Thank you for the suggestion!
---
Thought they were great aoe farmers?? Ffs my plan was just to farm gold. I don't wanna play a mage or hunter 😣
---
And pay for one more sub since having EU sub doesn't automatically give you access to NA.
---
This is not a solo game. If raiding or organized pvp premades are content you want to participate in, the meta is going to have a huge impact on your enjoyment of the game.
---
Asmingold and Towellieee deserve all the credit.
---
If I roll Alliance I'm going Dwarf baby!
---
They got an all expenses paid trip to Blizzard HQ and it’s possible that two of the devs are working on classic but under NDA
---
6Days if you are somewhat decent, yes. Plan out your route and learn proper leveling techniques like kiting mobs for xp etc.
---
If you were a top end player, skill wise, and in a high end guild then ragnaros would be dead by day 6.
---
Gotta level pickpocketing somehow mang.
---
Warrior - everyone can kite me
---
But they committed intellectual property crime... for the community :D 
---
WE THINK WE DO AND WE DO
---
Top end guilds have 90hours /played routes as well.
---
As a Paladin my favorite gank spot was Freewing Post. Not as overplayed as Crossroads, and the fact that it's on a cliff and you had 2 spells that gave you immunity to fall damage made it glorious.
---
You are cutting your damage in half as an enhancement shaman. However it sounds like you're open to healing, and Resto shaman are tons of fun, so you'll probably be ok.
---
In terms of efficient gold farming in dungeons nothing comes close to hunter. Just because druids might be able to solo some unimportant bosses that hunters can't, doesn't make them the best overall. It's not even close.
---
I mean the community for that language is obviously there, but I would much prefer to filter that out haha
---
That's what I was thinking. BM Hunter.
---
Why did you have to remind me
---
I really don't want to play on PVP because there are folks out there that live to ruin others experience. I'm at a place in life where I want to get on, accomplish my task, and log off. 
---
I would get frustrated if I got ganked consistently.
---
Blizzard not bothering with EU. The original Vanilla experience.
---
Spergs and their pog hyperbole is so AIDS.
---
It’s basically already out at this rate
---
Get gold, buy tokens for classic time.
---
They also ruin the economy preventing new players from being able to buy low level gear at reasonable prices.
---
Honestly twinking just makes me think of the TBC pre patch playing hunter where all my attacks would kill in 2-3 shots. It was funny but the novelty wore off pretty quickly.
---
"but I want to try PVP as another class" yeah because decking them out in all the best equipment in a level band is a requirement for that... in just the same way it's impossible to know what a class is like in lvl 60 pvp till you get the high warlord set right?
---
Common practice on privates, MC can be cleared in greens due to how easy it is. Once you have preraid BiS and some purples you split the 40man raid to 25ish man raids for more loot per week, assuming you did not level a 2nd 40man raid team to split 20man of the main team to gear em.
---
Grim Guzzler?
---
&gt; It was the golden age of AoE'ing everything to hell
---
That would be WoLK. In TBC, you still had to precisely orchestrate pulls in most heroics.
---
Are they popular? I doubt it
---
Darn kids, yeeting around nonstop! Back in my day we had 'QQ' and 'Owned noob', and if it was good enough for us, it's good enough for them!
---
Outside of locking down a quest hub or flight path to goad people into retaliating on their max level characters, I rarely gank let alone camp.
---
That said, I think anything flagged is perfectly fair game. Don't roll on a PvP server then whine like a crybaby carebear that you're getting camped and can't quest in this area when you have plenty of other things you can do until the gankers move on to something else.
---
It's a video game that deliberately includes mechanics that allow you to kill and grief other players in certain contexts. It's part of the game. Those who don't like it have a server option where they can avoid it. Win-win. Don't pick the wrong server then whine about it.
---
Nah, the best AFK spot was to get outside of the map so they couldn't see your character at all. 
---
I always hated leveling, and one expansion ( I believe it was WoD but they are starting to blend together)  I leveled from previous level cap- level cap mostly by AFKing AVs. I'm going to admit it, I was a dirty little shit. I never got caught and the only time I got deserter was when I forgot to come back and jump. I was doing all day AV spam mostly alt-tabbed.
---
Possibly, but it undeniable if they had all the files for their reference client they could have copy pasted faster than what they're giving us. I think in the longrun it will hurt launch having it a month after many people are back in school than to have it in proper summer where everyone is on holiday. I also think private servers are getting a bad rap when people say the numbers will be more correct. There are changes in private servers as well as changes in the classic we are getting. Neither is vanilla all over again, and only one of them is currently playable by everyone, and for free. Im not saying go play private servers as many of them are shutting down anyway, but at least they gave people a playable game in a reasonable timeframe.
---
Large chunks if time off is fucking amazing. Dunno what you're talking about!
---
Yes, but Balance druid can farm both of those as well as the other locations hunters cant do.
---
The thing is, for horde atleast. . . DW seems suboptimal compared to 2h, especially with BRE.
---
setups at a window always look great
---
Mind flay, definitely.
---
A more sensible (and obvious) suggestion would be to play on a PvE server.
---
3pm PST correct? Super hype!
---
it's 1 hunter per melee group, and raids don't usually take more than 1 hunter per melee group.
---
3pm PDT happens when this comment is 3 hours and 5 minutes old.

Jokes on you, I spec Spirit of Redemption as Priest and bug out unable to die..
---
Different level brackets have different meta games which I find fun
---
It's fun to build a twink and collect the gear
---
winning competitive games is the best feeling.  either 10v10 premades, or pugs with some twinks on each side its really fun to win a close game.
---
I was big in the twink game in TBC and WoTLK, and I would say 70% of twinks I came across didn't care about pwning noobs.   It was always more fun to beat the other twinks for bragging rights.   and the 30% of twinks that did do it just to GY camp and kill noobs were considered trash tier by twink guilds
---
&gt; you can get it under 100 hours
---
Oh yeah. 
---
Went Paladin after I got 70 on my warrior, such incredible fun tanking! 
---
It's crazy how much love every class got in TBC.
---
Thats fair.
---
More accurate to say mages are the best combination of easy to level and useful at endgame.
---
Whats CRZ?
---
So basically what I'm wondering is. . . for an orc warrior, is edgemasters still worth getting if you're using an Axe.
---
You can always move to China.
---
I think 250K stabilized post launch is a solid bet.  Expecting millions to stick around after a couple patches probably isn’t super realistic.  
---
I think they’ll get a few million people who have quit to resub for a few months at least.
---
*pssstt* 
---
He *is* the DPS doing stupid shit.
---
Which of course is the worst complaint because they announced the stress test dates on May 14th.
---
It looks really nice, maybe as a useless feature I would like the option to fade out the previously checkpoints so I just have them in view to remember what I just did. At the bottom it could also be a semi-transparent/fade out text for the next step in a scrolling box rather than just a page.     
---
Thinking about it as I am writing my guide from mixing different ones and how it feels doing it on my own, the most painful is to be very diligent in respecting precise quest name putting coordinates or quest ID.   It is much easier to just loosely write instructions and direction to move to.    
---
Beyond an in-game leveling guider helper it would be nice to have an offline leveling guide maker where you choose locations and quests from dropdown buttons and the website build the right code for you to transcribe them in readable instructions for an in game addon.
---
I don't understand why people have so much trouble with these... Just grab the quest and kill every zebra and Raptor you see while you do everything else... I always get done by the time i'm done with northern barrens.
---
&gt;I honestly don't see how people being able to do LFR cheapens your mythic experience but maybe that's just me.
---
Seeing the bosses for the first time used to be an incredible experience. People doing LFR (me included) cheapens that because once I see a boss on Heroic or Mythic mode...I've already killed him a dozen times.
---
For the record, there's nothing wrong with catch-up mechanisms. I thought the 2.4 badge system was actually brilliant and breathed new life into every old dungeon and raid in TBC. I thought Magister's Terrace was a brilliant addition to give people a very challenging 5 man with gear they could use for T6+. And I thought the same about ZulGurub, AQ20, Silithus grind.
---
The part that's wrong is that they've basically made the catch-up mechanism just be an extremely easy version of the current content, which really puts a dent into the satisfaction of getting your first kills.
---
&gt;I can't say that I really care that others are able to experience the raids on a lower difficulty.
---
It's not about what gear other people have or what bosses they've killed...it's that even in a vacuum looking only at myself, there's very little feeling of progression. I kill all the bosses on week 1, I get a bunch of items. At no point am I terribly awe inspired because I know this thing will die in under 5 pulls. From that point on all I'm doing is killing those same bosses on harder difficulties, and getting the same items with better stats and new skins. I'm not working towards finally killing the end boss, I'm not working towards finally getting an amazing item I was hoping for...I'm just killing the same boss with new abilities and numbers, and collecting the same item with bigger numbers.
---
&gt;I think you mean THE RACE, because for guilds with the best players in the world it's kinda obvious that lower difficulties aren't part of the race, or even a consideration. To call it "reclearing" seems silly.
---
That's what it is though. They've cleared the zone. Now they click their UI, select Mythic and see who can do it the fastest. It used to be that THE RACE was who could clear the zone. PERIOD.
---
&gt;If you don't mind me asking, what is your current CoS progress / world rank for BoD?
---
I don't have a world rank at all, we're a pretty middle of the road guild now. At no point here am I arguing that Heroic or Mythic are easy...they're hard as hell. Way harder than anything in Vanilla and TBC. It's just that starting in WotLK, the feeling of progression and sense of achievement has been watered down too much. Heroic should be the baseline difficulty for all raids, with Ulduar style activations to get you into Mythic.
---
&gt;To some extent, maybe yes. But your proposition of reducing the ilvl inflation would obviously mean that gap is far less.
---
I just mean the starting content of a new expansion would get another +13 ilvl bump, so instead of Kara being 115 it would have been 127. Sunwell would still be only 39 ilvls up from that though. So same ilvl inflation over the expansion, slightly higher initial inflation to try and invalidate previous gear better. 39 ilvls over an entire expansion...that's not much more than the difference between Normal and Mythic of a single raid right now.
---
PvP servers keep the game alive and dangerous. As long as you level up within the first few months - you’ll dodge most of the issues. People who join late in a servers life cycle are the ones that get camped by bored over geared 60s etc. 
---
Still worth it because the alternative is completely unfun imo. 
---
Only PvP you’ll find is in a BG and that’s not as fun for me personally. 
---
Don’t get me wrong - there are times you’ll get frustrated from being camped - it will sometimes happen - even when you’re level 60 - but playing on a normal server is worse
---
Not really, I'm looking for the same information. . . the only thing I've found is half-assed sections in bis lists for the most part.
---
The annoying part is being in a party of 5 as the warlock and you're the only one bothering to go to the instance. Then seeing these retarded fucks going "sum? Sum?" like some kind of mentally deficient birds and not seeming to grasp that at least two of them have to get their sorry excuse for an ass to the actual instance like the warlock has to.
---
I'm not particularly well researched on the "mobile phone Chinese gamer" market in terms of its size and make-up, it's possible a lot of these guys who played WoW 15 years ago but play P2W knock-off garbage today could possibly come back. No idea. I'm skeptical though, the Chinese fundamentally, on a cultural level, love P2W bullshit and Classic, if it is truly \#nochanges, is not compatible with that. 
---
Regardless, even if they do play, I expect a lot of them to drop out quickly to return to their knock-off cash-shop products.
---
I'm stuck at after creating the character. What and HOW do I go about using this tool?
---
PeOpLe WhO HaVe fUn iN a dIfFeRenT WaY tHaN Me SucK aT My WaY
---
Hop off that high horse. Twink PvP is fun because of how different it is. You have to master your craft with very few skills and develop your own strategy. My 19 twink priest was one of the most fun things I did in Vanilla. 30 min long duels outside of Org with all the rogues who laughed at the idea of a twink priest. Boy were they surprised how hard it was to kill someone with 1200 hp and near infinite mana. 
---
That being said, no one plays exclusively twinks. It's a fun minigame.
---
Raided a couple of times at 60, only got one item. In PvP I was getting slaughtered by raiders. So really twinking is PvP where the gear cap can be reached. I played lvl 49 bracket.
---
Stacking World Buffs being removed in TBC does not mean they were exploits in Vanilla.  
---
I will humor you. What is your evidence that stacking world buffs is an exploit in the same vein as reck bombing? (Hint: making content easier does not mean it is an exploit)
---
agreed.  when I first made a Twink 19 rogue I had fun killing noobs for a couple days.  but I was getting mad when other twinks killed me.   then it became WAY MORE fun to become a better player and kill the other twinks for bragging rights.   killing noobs got boring fast
---
You'll know by level 25-30 if PvP servers are for you.  If you don't like them reroll PvE and you've only last about 30 hours or so of game play.
---
I could see these lit up as video game marquee.
---
Completely different games. Uncomparable.
---
Hooold up.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Before it was invite only, this time it is sub only, think the last one (in July) might be for everyone with a [battle.net](https://battle.net) account.
---
&gt; If you're getting camped, maybe it's time to go to a different zone or start an alt toon. 
---
* do another quest and come back to this one later
---
* call in high level friends to deal with the problem
---
* level a profession
---
* do a battleground once they're implemented
---
* take a break from the game
---
* farm something
---
* run a dungeon
---
There's plenty to do if you can't level at your current exact location. I don't get why this is such a problem for people.
---
You're friend is ridiculous and you're a bit optimistic. I expect ~8 million people to start, a dip to ~1 million, and then steady around 2 million for the next year and a half.
---
This is a good option as well OP

---
Don't think so. I think it's a terrain/model issue, and that's the same as in vanilla.
---
So you're telling me that it is common practice for 30+ people to all level in under 6 days played time then clear MC in greens?  I find that hard to believe.  How long does it take them to clear MC like that?  Are you sure that is possible to do on classic without private server changes?
---
And WoW Classic, the very thing they set out to make to begin with
---
Lol that’s plenty of time. Now if they didn’t have layering...
---
Hey guys, so I'm a bit confused. I've heard people say that this is the release date for Europe, and that for PST it's going to release August 26? Is that true? I still need to call off for vacation, I don't wanna pick the wrong day lol.
---
I agree with pretty much everything, and yes i did know how to fake cast, use rank1 spell to counter mana problems, even use the rod that transform you in a bear to fool bad players into using their interrupt. I underused SoJ and sac for sure though. For asscandy, maybe my guild wasnt lucky, but i saw it drop only once in a whole year. The ZG trinket has way higher drop rate i think and its only 20 man.
---
Guess I'm just special ed then. That and I didnt really understand streamlining game progression at the time either. It was to help x cloth or furnish something for the barrens which at the time seemed rather important. I learned latter to say fuck those kids.

---
Well, like a lot of things in life it's not that cut and dry. 
---
Some feel that people should have the right to make available older games that have been abandoned by their developer, and vanilla is so different from modern WoW that I think you could make an argument for it being an entirely different game at this point.
---
This is partly why Sony Online Entertainment and Daybreak Games have given permission to Project 1999 to continue to operate. P99 is essentially the Nostalrius of classic EverQuest.
---
By the way, this is increasingly going to be a hot topic in the coming decade or two as older games fade into obscurity and the laws weren't exactly written for the digital error.
---
And then there are those of us who believe that the implementation of intellectual property and copyright is a bit insane in general. The laws are quite pro-corporate and anti-consumer. You should absolutely have a few years to profit from your IP, but the public should have access to a common IP in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Well yes, if private servers and all the biggest polls (+15k) are any indication, shamans are among the most popular classes with mage and warrior. This is of course for horde only, as in total numbers ( alliance + horde) they look like they are not popular.
---
Some of the negatives aren’t really negative but actually positive. Just the feeling of being vulnerable in contested zones is enough to roll pvp. I recommend it 100% and at the same time i would never recommend pve, ever.
---
That's pretty much me.  I typically have to leave STV at some point just so I can get on with leveling.  The moment I login in that zone I stop caring about grinding and questing.
---
Jesus this sub is cynical.
---
Such a pain in 5 mans.
---
Beta for subscription is a very old thing. Access to beta for people that preordered the game is used by everyone now
---
Yup, that did happen. But reputation was also a thing, so that person could very well end up blacklisted by guilds for negative actions. In retail, nobody gives a shit because with sharding and cross realm LFG, you will likely never interact with them again. An anti-social game breeds antisocial behavior.
---
Actions tend to speak louder than words, as they say. Someone pays attention more when he’s dead. I’ve had many times where I’d be yelling at the DPS to stop. I’d barely save him once or twice, then I’d just let him die. Most of the time the DPS just doesn’t care if you tell them to stop. So, I see nothing wrong with letting the person die in these cases.
---
NPC's and questgivers from my vanilla experience weren't targeted that heavily outside of the early days. Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be pretty hectic with world pvp, and you *will* have tons of players with the "You're red, you're dead," mentality (I'll probably be one of those around level 45+.) I never regretted my decision to roll pvp back in the day. PVP servers lead to stronger friendships IMO. People are more friendly and willing to help when you've got their back and they've got yours. 
---
If you can't afford to no-life it, know that people who will be no-lifing will have the edge over you in most pvp scenarios. If you're a healer, you'll have a bit of an easier time if you have a consistent group that has your back. You heal them, they kill allies/hordies for you. 
---
The big question you need to ask yourself is what your goals are. Do you want to level quickly and get to 60 asap? Will it bother you if you have like 10 hours a week to play and you spend 3 of those hours PVPing? Weigh the options and see if PVE or PVP will be better for you.
---
3.6.  Not great, not terrible.
---
Looks super useful!
---
Its very likely 8.2 has gotten delayed a bit. People certainly were expecting it earlier.
---
I really doubt they are trying to make classic and retail compete.
---
As a rogue i get enough hate from most so im usually the first to show up to stone/talk about cc targets through the dungeon. If im a helpful rogue maybe we can get rid of some of the stigma. I have my doubts
---
now say that again with a full time job + part time school lol
---
ah well, doesn't really matter
---
There is no difference. 1 min in game is 1 min in reAl life. 
---
You’re fucked.
---
No, support is not a proper role in wow. Every class has support/utility abilities, and a good player will be using those support abilities when the situation calls for it. When the situation doesn't call for it, which is most of the time, I hope you're able to function well your primary role in the party. 
---
If you're the type of player that seduces one mob and fears another in a pack of 3, then puts corruption and curse of agony on a mob that's going to die in 8 seconds, I'm going to try my hardest to avoid grouping with you next time I put a group together.
---
But if you're dropping a well-timed distract on a patrol to keep it from adding or using your cc or snares to help control loose mobs while putting out good dps, you'll probably be the first person I whisper when I put together a group.
---
haha my sub runs out tomorrow
---
Oh well, I guess there are some drawbacks to me moving here...

---
So I guess to put it simply it comes down to what you want out of the game. Are you going to get ganked on a PvP server? Yes. Any class/spec you make you are going to get ganked. NPC's will be killed and camped, people will camp your corpse with their friend camping GY. This is Classic WoW in a nutshell.
---
On the other hand, if you ever intend on wanting to take part in the miraculous shitshow that world pvp brings to the table, rolling on a non PvP server disables this. The absolute, without a question, best part of Vanilla and BC were that cities like ogrimmar, IF, SW, undercity were massively populated at all hours of day and night, it would take massive organization and overwhelming motivation to raid a city, and it results in a level of PvP that has never been able to be recreated in any game. Blizzard destroyed this with the release of WOTLK where players were encouraged to stay in safezone dual faction cities. Interaction died, and with it WoW imo. Every expansion to follow was just another stab to the chest.
---
When Classic comes out questing zones will be flooded with ganking. If you are leveling casually, you don't have to worry as much since it's going to take you months to grind even without any ganking. Non PvP servers are generally also shit, the playerbase is generally awful at just about everything and the competitive aspect of the server is dull and uninteresting. 
---
So you need to ask yourself, "Do I want to play on a dogshit server with a bunch of flowerpicking garbo players" or "Do I want to deal with getting ganked in exchange for playing on a quality server?"
---
If you roll on a PvE server you will likely regret it in the long run. If you roll on a PvP server you will have to deal with getting ganked. This is Classic WoW. Some people play the game to make best friends and play barbie dress up dolls with their toons in discord with a bunch of other vermin, some people want to be competitive in progression, some people want to PvP, and some people want to grief other players because they know it's annoying. Everyone is entitled to play the game how they like as long as they spend the 15$ a month. If you can't handle getting griefed then yeah I guess go for a Pve or RP server.
---
Druid - People who'll never play at the top 1% will shun it because they're trying to min/max in situations where just letting me off-tank/dps or off-tank/heal is far better than forcing a Warrior to go Prot for an add that lasts 30s.
---
They kinda have that 1 pointless questline in dragonblight. Pretty sad
---
Horde can have Paladins in Retail?!? Omg. So glad I haven’t paid into this mess in years.
---
Now this just makes me picture Mike playing as a tank, seeing dps pull a huge pack, and start yelling *”Put that thing back where it came from or so help me!”*
---
Shadowmeld fades the second you begin the Aimed Shot cast,   forget when it was changed,  but Aimed Shot from Shadowmeld was deemed a bug and fixed prior to 1.12
---
Don’t forget to misdirect to a different hunter first. Let them take the heat for the pull!
---
Most people will never realize...
---
1-2hours for MC.
---
And ofc it's possible, guilds that do not take meme shitters like rets with them and farm consumables will soon after split the 40man raid into 2 20man raids which can fully clear MC.
---
People are not bad at the game anymore. You use performance enhancing drugs during the leveling period, also by the end of the first month you have those people level a 2nd 60 so you can have 2 40man raids with 20mains per raid.

Supporting it.
---
I may have found a bug. On mobile if a character is already equipped and I switch his phase he doesn’t switch sets for some reason - I have to make a new set.
---
&gt;When that time comes, to me, at least on a PvP server you can commit to an and alive and dangerous world. 
---
/PvP turns on PvP on a PvE server.

This is childish of you to say. He already made it clear that being harassed by rogues with no lives isn't his idea of a good time.

For the early raids sure. Not AQ and naxx
---
I am going to be playing alongside a shaman and too save on ammo and bag space and the like I will be meleeing a lot. It will help when we get WF totem. Kind of unorthodox but I’m trying to have a weird fun way of leveling to 60.
---
Math test with calculators allowed, you choose not to use a calculator because you think it's bad. That's the exact same logic, but it's easy to make something seem toxic by comparing it to things like steroids..
---
I'm aware of the mechanics, just didn't know which rules where in effect.
---
when it doesn't block rage, pre-shielding before the pull  then drink after, gives tank more time to  estabilish rage before I have to do anything, and keeps the group from downtime.
---
But as is, shield doesn't really help me much on a rage tank.  Losing the global cool down before starting the heal I really need postpones the problem, but the shield plus and old renew, can be a good move  but just like everything else it's situational.  It's going to take awhile to relearn all these old tactics.

This might be a dumb question... if I buy game time today, will I have access on the 19th?
---
BG weekends were fun as hell you could get serious XP when AV was up
---
This is pretty true.
---
Only to people that don't play well with others.
---
Is it just me or is it hard to pinpoint just why this is your favorite zone? So many reasons.
---
No pain no gain
---
Isn’t that an alchemy thing?
---
I mained a warrior from vanilla to wrath, but I'm gonna do pally this time. It's shame I can't tank at 60, but I'll do fine in dungeons.
---
Unrelated questions someone might help me answer. I raided a lot in wrath as fury and prot, and as fury I knew armor pen was awesome. But I never actually figured out what made it so good - it seemed counter intuitive that armor pen beat everything til the soft cap. I stacked it anyway but didn't get why. Can any one explain for me why like I'm an idiot?
---
I don't have a guide. i just kinda played with it until i figured out how to do what i was trying to do. And it really depends on what you're trying to do. I was looking for specific gear slots and prefer visual results, plus i write APIs for my day job. So it worked well for me.
---
When you do an advanced search it creates a request that has the search parameters in it. So for example, [https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.1.5&amp;filter=minrl=60;maxrl=60;MOD\_D=1:10:0;](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.1.5&amp;filter=minrl=60;maxrl=60;MOD_D=1:10:0;) for the items parameter "4.1.5", 4 = armor, 1 = cloth, 5 = chest. minrl and maxrl is the required level. MOD\_A through MOD\_C are primary stats (int, sta, agi) and MOD\_D through MOD\_F are for bonuses. in that request "1:10:0", 1 = damage and healing, min 10, max unlimited. 2:10:0 would search for healing bonus, 3:10:0 is critical strike. NPCs, quests, zones all have similar search strings.
---
PVP is the *best* option for casual players. It doesn't take long to put together a low-level twink undead rogue to haunt Redridge whenever you feel like playing. Even without twinking, as someone who has nothing better to do than mess up leveling lowbies until they log you will enjoy great success. It's a lot easier to prevent someone from leveling than to level up yourself.
---
Casual ganking of people trying to quest is the way to go if you don't have a bunch of playtime. It takes a hell of a lot less time than raiding, PVP ranking, or even max level open world PVP. Redridge ganking is the best minigame in WoW.
---
Original vanilla player here disagreeing with your statement that good world pvp in vanilla was a myth. Guess you werent part of the right communities or any other number of variables that would explain your wpvp experience being so bad.
---
At least 2.
---
&gt;You must register to make a character
---
And Iam out
---
That parent should be grateful to all the people who do show up on time and should have no issue with them progressing faster.
---
A guild full of people with inconsistent raid attendance won't function.   You need the reliable raiders.
---
That all seems a bit insane to me... Hah.  I haven't played on any private servers and haven't played vanilla since vanilla was on retail, and back then I raided up through the first few bosses in Naxx.  Clearing MC in all blues/greens in only 2 hours seems crazy thinking back on how I remember it.  But I guess if everyone knew every fight and knew the best ways to level and played 20 hour days it could be possible.  Playing like that just doesn't seem like any fun.
---
Depends if it results in clearing the dungeon quicker. You shouldn't be playing a tank if you get your panties twisted by people doing some pulling for you and if it results in actually clearing the dungeon quicker. 
---
Mind you my opinion is largely colored by playing wotlk pservers/live. Classic is much more different I reckon due to reduced AoE cleave and slower threat generation.
---
Depends on the encounter of course but for the most part keeping totems like str of earth/stoneskin, mana spring or grace of air. Stoneclaw for when you pull too many (situational) or poison cleansing during the last boss in BFD is nice.
---
Totems just feel more...responsive, tactile and immediate. Like, I see there's a problem and I'm dropping this totem NOW to help remedy that.
---
Exactly what they wanted? Vanilla wow.
---
But isn't hunter already a counter to rogues? Why would you need another leg-up? I feel like you should pick racials to assist with your counters
---
I fucking hate DKP. Much rather prefer class group loot. Was in a guild on pserver that utilized a “class loot” selection where there was a “class leader” in the guild and a corresponding google spreadsheet (in this case, the mages) used to “prioritize” items they wanted from a raid. Made it much less competitive and we all still got loot.

It's 182 hours from launch to raid reset. We'll give you 14 hours (6 on Monday, 8 on Tuesday) for attunement, quintessence chain, and the actual raid. That leaves 168 hours to get to 60 and you only need 100, so it's doable in ~14 hours a day.

Agreed. We need an etiquette PSA thread or something. Ideally in these situations everyone is heading for the dungeon, but etiquette states that the party leader, the warlock, and whoever else was invited first should be the first ones to the instance.

Didn't hate it at all. Quite liked it in fact. To your point, I didn't care for the underwater zone, however it was rushed and needed work.

WOD would be a better thing to take a look at for your point. People want more large scale wpvp? BOOM Trashcan, err, Ashran\*. People don't like content droughts? Alright let's implement a garbage system to evenly spread content releases (except HFC of course, teehee oopsie!). People want more classes to be viable? Alright let's give them all a rework which puts everyones power level so high that everyone one-shots everyone else.

Correction: You paid 15 dollars to star at log in screens and refresh server menus for 2 days...
---
As a rogue player (also beta tester) that’s been doing this all my life I’d say the only reason I do it is habit now. I used to do it because after your stun ends you’re already on the move and you can attempt to confuse your opponent because you’re jumping back and forth.
---
IT'S STILL SO LONGGGG. I've been trying to fill the gap with other mmos while I wait. Tried FF14 and currently trying ESO. Stopped playing 14 cause I hate Final Fantasy aesthetic (don't know why I thought the MMO would be different lol) and ESO is a bit better. Probably won't play it for much longer though since the combat is. so. damn. bad. Take the poor controls from Elder Scrolls games and combine it with the poor controls of MMO's and you can imagine how rough it is.

Putting out feelers for a guild!
---
**NA | RP or PVE Alliance** (will consider PVP for the perfect guild)
---
**What I'm looking for:** LGBTQA+ &amp; somewhat family friendly guild for chatting and laughs and all that good stuff. Needs to be free of hate speech, racism, and sexism/misogyny. I'd prefer if the player age bracket skewed older, but if everyone is fun to be around that's what matters the most to me.
---
I will for sure be bringing my husband and there is the potential that multiple straggler relatives (all with lots of experience) will tag along. I'll be no-life-ing it the week of launch and then shifting into more casual play after that. I think we'd all \*like\* to raid but it would have to be casual due to our lines of work and real life responsibilities. I wouldn't count on all of us being able to make multiple raid nights a week, but we might be good choices for benchwarmers in case some of the main crew doesn't show up; if your guild only raids one night a week, maybe we could make the time(s) work. 
---
**What I bring to the table:** Alts. A LOT OF ALTS. I'll probably be maining a hunter (skin/LW) with a mage alt (tail/ench). I consider myself fairly helpful and knowledgeable about the game and enjoy having lots of recipes in my profession arsenal (hence the alt army, though for Classic I intend to try and focus on just a couple). I enjoy helping lowbies out by giving them dungeon runs or bags/starter gold, and get a lot out of teamwork play. I would dearly love to be people's go-to enchanter and like dungeons quite a bit. :)

What flavor of boot is your favorite?

Huh lol

That's actually a good way to describe it.

It was removed. Their functionality did not change between vanilla and BC. There's no arguing stacking world buffs was not intended.

Thats not how it works at all. Its funny just based on your posts I can tell you are from the US because you have no clue about the EU servers, that dont exist at all! There is no seperate hardware, no seperate patch no seperate anything. EU beta, PTR, stress tests etc ALL HAPPENS ON US SERVERS. 
---
So no there is no good reason for them not to open it for EU too.
---
I thought it is? You can at least make trials on the US servers from the EU (I've done it myself). Though I'm not sure if you can subscribe.
---
Hell yes! Congrats on the move and good luck with it, hopefully you'll be able to get that going!
---
They bought a lot of the old WoW sites.

In a way I'd rather just get a 404 error.

Keep in mind that the boss you kill for this quest requires a Mallet to ring the gong to be summoned. The mallet can be a bit of a pain in the ass to get but an awesome adventure.
---
Yeah but Oceania is a package deal with NA.
---
Realistically, its an NA test, but OCE gets to come because they're friends with the boss's kid.
---
Wrong, EU live servers are seperate. Everything else such as beta is not.
---
There is common etiquette rules for this. Everyone moves to the instance and the two first to get there other than the warlock help summon. Unless someone specifically tells you that you don't need to move to the instance, you move to the instance.
---
Take screenshots of your old toons and post them with titles like "recovered my vanilla account!" for karma.

STOP IT!! STOP BEING REALISTIC

It's probably to test actual projected load from that region. Which suggests there will be an EU only stress test too.

and what evidence do you have that imply classic will have more social engagement beyond spamming for lfg/lfm?
---
Yeah at that point you ask the druids to surround the mage and keep casting Innervate so the Mage can keep baking.
---
A specific addon for our guild.
---
Then do it on a chair you were going to buy anyway, then you have nothing to lose.
---
Hehe Booty Bay is one of the best pvp maps from any game, ever.  xD
---
good thing classic dungeon are about on par with a modern heroic then.. as in, they don't require any communication... maybe putting a moon marker on top of a mob head, in extreme cases.
---
Exactly and in vanilla it’s not like when you shift click a toxic players name and it says 0 players total because they aren’t apart of your battle group. In classic it will identify their guild and everything easy blacklisting.

You can subscribe, but you have to pay, even if you have 5 eu accounts with paid subscription
---
It's not necessarily because they're bad at max level PvP but because at max level PvP you need raid gear to be competitive, which is more time/scheduling commitment than people can put in.
---
What do you think they have been doing? When EA-Actavision started to learn they made good money off CoD maps they started to look at games as a service. IE Software as a Service
---
I mean do you have to have every toon decked out in the best gear at all times to have fun or be proficient? Sounds like retail talk to me...

---
This was a big question going into classic for myself and a couple other friends - while pvp is fun and open world pvp just adds that much more to the world - pve is going to be what we are going to do.
---
Might roll an alt on a pvp server way later down the road but for launch PvE is the plan at launch.
---
I enjoy a lot of pvp, but I also enjoy just going out on and farming sometimes - that's not really going to be as possible when there are groups of guildies running around to stock up on mats for consumables.
---
Not to mention phase 2 like you said - part of me wants to roll pvp server first just to experience phase 2 since it won't happen again, but I don't know if it's worth the time put in.
---
Hope you are able to figure it out!
---
This applies to a lot of BC too, but Human After All by Daft Punk came out at the height of my playing and entire zones are directly associated with that album
---
If you like ganking you'll miss it on PvE, that said if you toggle PvP on there'll be a surprising number of people willing to wreck your shit up.
---
Do you like playing PvP or winning PvP? If you just want to participate an alt on PvP is very doable
---
Ha. Do you also complain and point it out when people wear fake brand clothes made in China?
---
I was a preteen when I first started playing WoW. I had no money of my own. I started with private servers, played old content. Those pservers let this poor little boy discover a whole new world without asking for anything back. When I started having an income I bought retail. 
---
People asked for classic, Blizzard ignored them for years. They (tried) giving the people exactly what they want. 
---
Complain about IP theft all you want, they'll always be the good guys in many people's books.
---
It's a fun change of pace, when you have 200 days played sometimes you do different stuff.

As long as that new content is completely disconnected from the 1-60 experience, then sure. Otherwise, it will always negatively affect the previous content.
---
This is why TBC needed to be it's own 1-60 experience instead of having it trivialize previous endgame content.
---
Good on you for deciding to roll a different class rather than try and make elemental work! I understand that people can and will try to make elemental work in the pve scene but you'll definitely have a better time if your goal is to DPS in a serious raiding environment.
---
As someone who hit rank 11 back in the day, multi-glad in BC, loves PvP at the core... my answer is no. We already know the trajectory of Classic. Raid or die, or no-life 3 months straight. The game is in many ways comparable to a P2W game, except that instead of paying with money you're paying with time spent in raids instances or time spent consecutively in BGs. If you're a "F2P" player, AKA a casual, you basically exist for other players to kill you. 
---
My friends and I are rolling PvE in Classic. If you have even the slightest bit of a competitive streak and believe you are superior to others, you're going to be pissed as hell when some nerd who spent more time on a video game beats you because he hasn't taken a shower in the last 4 weeks. Just save yourself the headache and roll PvE.
---
the meaning of the emote is the same even if there isn't an actual image.
---
Resto is THE spec for flag running (8/11/31). The HotW spec is also a good PvP spec but resto is a lot of fun in PvP because druids are so insanely mobile. It's fun annoying the enemy team by rooting them, or hibernating other druids/hunter's pets, and having the team start focusing on you, then you just run away and let your team eat them up.
---
AV testing has solidified my idea to not play rogue. I thought I would be a fun ganking powerhouse... instead I found a slow, waiting for energy, boring time.
---
They already do with BFA in retail. It's called releasing time gated content. Oh, this just came out and you want to have an epic night of gaming? No, we will break your immersion by asking you to wait next week or to tomorrow after your mission is completed.  
---
/s but at the same time not really sarcasm  
---
Seriously, it's fun to plan a long and immersive moment of gaming and it's not fun to have it cut for nothing. Classic will be fun for that.
---
But July is the middle of winter...
---
April of next year will be the test, obviously there will be a major dropoff after launch, but new players will come too.
---
MY FAITH IS MY SHIELD!
---
At this point I'm not even sure if you are being sarcastic or not.
---
The fact that you were even asking made it seem like you were familiar with how things were, and just didn't know when the change happened.
---
The other few replies you received made it sound like you should never use PW:S on a warrior tank, period.  That may not have been their intent, but I wanted to clarify for any new priest healers who read through.

6 days in-game?  Yes - it's a hyper aggressive pace, but yeah, it's do-able.  6 calendar days?  Not a chance.
---
For when?
---
They also had a hub in icecrown, I agree they were underutilized though.
---
Wed-Fri, it's 48 hours this time.
---
The DPS having to lay off at the start of each fight and the Paladin having to constantly stop and drink for mana isn't "no problem." A warrior who slaps on a shield and just spams tab and sunder is so much better it's a joke.
---
Telling prospective paladin players that they can tank 5-mans "if their group is smart" is technically true while being bad advice at the same time.
---
Opposite for me haha. But to each their own
---
this. just having to watch your back/think of where you would escape to/saving cd's incase someone comes makes the game more fun even if brawls dont break out everytime you log on
---
**Title**
---
We're \*\*&lt;Rising&gt;\*\*! A new semi-hardcore raiding guild playing Horde on an EU-PVP server.
---
We have all been waiting a long time for Classic WoW and we are looking to build our roster of players now so that we can really hit the ground running.
---
The main focus of our guild will be to build a community of friendly players that are keen to help each other and get the most enjoyment out of Classic. We believe that having a group of supportive players will be a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
**Raiding**
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 11:30 CET for progression raids, although I do not expect we will need all 3 days to clear the current content (at the start).
---
If you do sign up we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is young we're starting to get a core raiding team together, at the moment our preference on roles for new raiders are:
---
\- Strong - Restoration Shaman
---
\- Strong - Mage
---
\- Strong - Fury Warrior
---
\- Medium - Warlock
---
\- Medium - Restoration Druid
---
\- Weak - Hunter
---
\- Weak - Holy Priest
---
\- Weak - Rogue
---
However if you see your class listed as week priority or even close, we are always open for exceptional candidates and will will be taken into consideration.
---
We're running a Loot Council system for raiding with the goal to be as transparent as possible. While we know this can be a turn off for new members we want to make sure that the loot that is distributed is fair and also rewarding for those who are loyal, attendant and good members of our community.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this is much further down the line.
---
**Other guild activities**
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. Personally, a lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid a capital cities.
---
There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members. So I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
**Member expectations**
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, are willing to help their fellow guildies and can have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we separate expectations such as turning up and so on.
---
If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website [**https://rising.shivtr.red/**](https://rising.shivtr.red/). You will need let us know a little about yourself and that we share the same values.
---
Additionally, if you have any questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord **@\[Rising\] Boo#0059**, **@GlenCoco#3702**, **@mizi#3868** or **@QFierced#7447**.
---
**Lok'tar Ogar!**
---
Yeah, support is a thing, but every class has "support" abilities, it's not a role in itself.
---
Make an account-&gt;instantly exit
---
do you really plan to have 8 alts in classic? damn that will take a while to level and gear up!
---
Depends upon how I feel. Sometimes I envision myself as Stitches, appearing out of nowhere to inflict a messy end upon some unfortunate soul, bad luck. Other times I let people go about their business, what sort of psychopath kills everybody just because he can?

The best part about classic servers is the player interaction while leveling and in endgame. The pve in general is too easy to keep most people's attention.

For a long time they let people get away with it, but just recently, maybe 3-4 months ago there was a ban wave for people doing it on retail.

I think part of the problem is that any such tinkering with game files can create exploits that are indistinguishable from blizzards perspective.

Wowzers really upset - hope your raid leader and bg premades spam you with weirdchamp.
---
Retadins were one of the most fun things to happen in my WoW gaming history but as a Horde player I will just have to wait for Belfs to maybe one day arrive.
---
i'd be impressed if we have 100k player by the time AQ launch.
---
It should be working now, but it's slightly hidden behind the filter options and the autofill does not select from them. I may change the autofill behaviour and try to improve the UI around the filters to make it a bit more obvious. For example: [browsing shadow wrath helms](https://imgur.com/a/182N7R0).
---
This ^ get a guild. Level with a buddy. You will be fine. Also as a healer you can level in dungeons instead of the open world if it gets to bad.

I love flying. I had so much fun. I still explored. I would level on the ground through whatever current expansion content and eyeball locations I just couldn't wait to see from the sky. I'd fly up and dive down and weave between trees. It was a lot of fun for me.
---
But I'm also firmly in the "it should never have been added" camp.
---
&gt; Hypothetically, let’s say you work for blizzard and they gave you the power to release post classic content and reintroduce flying. How would you go about it? Would you make any changes, keep it the same, or not introduce it all? 
---
I wouldn't introduce it at all. I do think there are some things tied to flying that I would keep. Elemental Plateau in Outland for example was a neat max-level farming concept. I would not introduce flight, but I would work in some rep-gated flight paths for players to unlock at max level. These could also serve as a gold sink.
---
I think in order to implement flying in an immersive way that doesn't let you AFK safely in contested territory, avoid wPvP completely, and render all other forms of travel obsolete, it would have to be so restricted that there's little point even implementing it at all. All of the functionality that limited flying mount provides can easily be baked into additional flight paths and other means of travel/movement unlocked via a max-level gold sink.
---
Didn’t the main dudes get jobs?
---
As does mine hahaha but it wouldn’t be the same
---
Eh
---
I see how you're spending your time until Classic.
---
Hunter: Losing bag slots for ammo. How’s a guy supposed to level skinning, first aid, and mining while grinding without stopping every 5 minutes? Oh and melee leeway without proper ways to regain distance.
---
Thanks for the support! Really excited
---
this is how I am now too.  When I was younger I def camped more but with less time I like to net a quick ego kill and then continue on
---
Well it’s also just due to escalation though, right? If you go into a level 19 BG there are good odds that the enemy team is gonna have at *least* a few decked out twinks. If you want to be able to compete with them and you have the money it would be silly *not* to deck yourself out similarly. 
---
Although yeah there are absolutely those who do it and just want to prey on the weaker folk. Not even gonna argue that one
---
eyyyyyyyyyyyyy smite Priest
---
To make it worse, the inconsistent players also tend to know the least about their class and rotation, so they need the most preparation.
---
I love these names.
---
Looks like signs for water parks.
---
&gt;Enhancement shaman: drop windfury totem, stormstrike, shock, pray for windfury procs.
---
Close but no. Only in a raid would you use WF totem, if you get to dps at all - When an enhance shaman picked up a beefy two hander in PvP or out in the world, you put windfury on the weapon, and drop Grace of Air totem. Windfury totem gives 2 extra attacks, WF Totem only gives one extra attack when it procs (and doesn't work while other weapon enchants are active).
---
GoA = More agility = more crits = better uptime on flurry = more windfury procs.
---
People suffering from Asperger's syndrome and their *something* hyperbolic frazing very much resembles Auto-immune deficiency syndrome.
---
By pulling aggro off them you let them know you will accept that kind of behavior and they end up doing it again and again. At some point, it's going to cause a wipe anyway. The best solution in my opinion is to let them "tank" it until they die and then you start tanking it with the rest of the group so everyone else doesn't die. They get a repair bill and you let them know not to do it again. If you're nice, you pull it off them the first time and give them the warning then. Obviously if all the other dps and the healer all engage immediately, that is a different story, but that is when you decide how to react.
---
I get it, it's a lot of trouble dealing with these people, and a lot of the time just struggling through pulls and letting them be assholes is the "easiest" way to get the dungeon done. It also sets a bad example and lets them know it's okay to act like that though. It might even let the other dps know they can also act that way and you create even more problems for more people in the future. They act the same way in future dungeons with other people and the cycle continues until you break them. If enough people treat them that way then they will either behave or quit the game, both acceptable outcomes. At a certain point it becomes more about principle than pure efficiency, especially when your sanity is involved.

I used to charge 25silver for summon

Or maybe people were just sick of the weekly, "REMEMBER NOSTALRIUS CAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE CLASSIC OTHERWISE" posts.
---
We're in boys.
---
I'll get right on that on my Paladin. :D
---
I've been putting some thought into this, and I agree it can lead to some less than ideal behaviour right now, particularly in some cases where autofill puts you above the cap.
---
I'm a bit hesitant to just drop the value of hit when you're at the cap because it can still be useful to see it's value if you're sitting at cap and deciding where you might swap out one item with +hit for a different one in another slot. Maybe a toggle to apply caps or not while you're browsing? Still needs some thought.
---
It's really just to convey a certain emotion/feeling. Poggers can be said to convey approval and to show you're happy for achieving something, similar to yelling "fuck yeah!" when you, or a friend of yours has achieved something.
---
Gotta say though that most twitch emotes are often overused to even have any relevant meaning. They, at least to me, seem to mostly be used for meme-purposes which just makes you sound like a hipster of sorts.
---
Its 83 cents per month to disable ads.
---
Yeah lol. If you think max lvl pvp in vanilla isn't about gear then you're an idiot. Plus when twinking you run up against other twink premades, just like at max lvl. Those other lowbies should be lvling anyway. 
---
It's the same shit. Pvp until WoD, iirc, was all about gear. People who think there is some secret skill to pvp or getting rank 14 are clueless.
---
In fact, the gear disparity may even be worse at max lvl lol. A rank 14 equipped toon is prolly more powerful than a fresh 60 in blues than a twink to a non twink, respectively.
---
OK. I understood all the words... but still... um... never mind. I think the best course is just not to care. :)
---
HA!

US Central Horde PvP

I am planning on playing a Troll Mage. I am also looking to try and stay away from big streamer servers. I will be playing on weekdays around 5-10pm CST. More on the weekends. I do have a family so time will vary here and there depending on what is going on that week. I plan on trying to get to 60 ASAP. I have played on and off since vanilla lately more off since Draenor as WoW has not appealed to me. I am looking to go back to vanilla wow and experience all the things again when I was a kid.
---
&gt;Ha. Do you also complain and point it out when people wear fake brand clothes made in China?
---
Yes?
---
&gt;I was a preteen when I first started playing WoW. I had no money of my own. I started with private servers, played old content. Those pservers let this poor little boy discover a whole new world without asking for anything back. When I started having an income I bought retail. 
---
Cool story.
---
&gt;Complain about IP theft all you want, they'll always be the good guys in many people's books.
---
Well I don't really care about the opinions of people who support crime.
---
aggressive bet I hope there's not too much on the line ;)
---
Adblock?
---
I have a feeling it's a typo
---
My main was mage in vanilla. I also had a rogue and warlock which I most played in PvP. Starting in wrath I switched to tanking. I found it more fun than dpsing. I did DK tanking in Wrath and Cata. Then in Mists, Warlords, and Legion I played DK and Warrior tank. I basically have permanently quit now so I never played BFA.
---
So this time around I will be maining a Prot Warrior and hope to (if my schedule allows) tank some MC, BWL, and maybe more. Ugh the warrior leveling process is going to be such chore lol.
---
They are actually letting in anyone with a subscription to this round of stress test. I'd imagine they'll have an open beta at some point as well.
---
You're absolutely right - they are monetizing WoW Classic in any possible way they can. But I'd way rather they try to front load that crap rather than stick a WoW Classic Store in there or enable paid transfers or level boosts. Your decision whether you pay an extra $7.50 of otherwise unusuable sub time just to get your name reserved... just keep the MTX out!
---
Then they haven't balanced it very well unfortunately
---
hum...
---
you'll be happy to know in classic you'll be spamming a single ( maybe two) downranked heal over and over instead.
---
and pooping totems every now and then, of course.
---
Look I get it, but that doesn't make it ok or legal.
---
There's no xp in BGs in Vanilla. If you're staying in a city and doing battlegrounds you're good.
---
Ah I was shocked when I used it on my aq40 mage recently and wondered how it could hit so fucking hard haha
---
Except PvP must be turned on for both sides. 
---
And it’s hard to be childish when that’s exactly what it is. He may have his own valid reasons for it - but that is what he’s doing lol.
---
I’m ok with classic twinks because changing it would probably have lots of unintended consequences but the argument that twinks are mainly looking to fight other twinks and not trash noobs died when queues in xp locked bgs were non existent when they were added.
---
I mean not the first couple of hours, but definitely after yes!
---
People gear up at lvl 60 and end up killing lower geared players, whats the difference?
---
Played on PvE nost, mostly because it released around the time I started playing there. Don't regret it. If your goals are just to level, do some dungeons, maybe raid, and don't have grandiose plans of playing classic constantly for several months, then PvE should be fine. 
---
If you are planning on going all out and playing a lot, especially before BGs, then a PvP server is probably better, it adds something else to do, or at least makes some of the less interesting stuff you can do in the world more interesting (and time consuming) by adding a PvP element. 
---
Or if you're really into PvP and that's the reason you play WoW, then ofc go PvP server.
---
You unironically think not wanting to commit crime makes me a bootlicker?
---
You're pathetic.
---
source? honestly asking as I have never heard it in the past and I'd be interested to find more how it works!
---
Concurrent is typically 10% of total active players. Not the same thing.
---
LOL, I never saw that happen. Would be funny as hell, though. 
---
They just showed up 30 mins early to the raid and started casting &amp; handing out 1 stack at a time while providing portals to people who inevitably forgot something vital. 
---
Actually, everyone in the guild had to be there 30-60 mins early or risk losing your spot. 
---
I always had to take a trip to scholomance before every raid in order to make flasks. Fun times.
---
Get a na sub.
---
You could still stack and enter raids with the buffs, just not over level 63.
---
They didnt want you to use vanilla buffs in tbc raids.
---
when i made a first steps in wow , thottbot helped me so much, without TB it would be much more difficult.
---
K. 
---
Doesn't change the fact that in Classic, the better player doesn't always win, so if you're even slightly competitive and know you're better than your opponent, you're getting to end up salty when you could save yourself a lot of headache.
---
There is 0 evidence that DW Tanking is "invalidated completely". It MIGHT make DW tanking invalid. It will most likely be viable but MAY result in slightly higher damage taken.   
---
This whole " you can't buff yourself because you will rip aggro" is another one of your made up facts that you talk about as if it is a fact.   
---
Only people who are actually stuck on top of the threat meter without buffs for the entire raid will experience this. Currently, noone in my raid on private server spends the whole raid threat capped. Every single one of them benefits from their character being stronger.
---
You're fucking retarded.  Also you have zero concept of reality. I raided back in 2004 with players who were parents when I myself was still single.  I plan on raiding with parents again, especially now that I am one.  As long as people communicate ahead of time and try not to make it a serial habit it's usually a non issue for many people.
---
You originally said that people who show up late get half DKP. That is not an incentive, that is a punishment.  If someone shows up late, they are already missing out on the boss DKP/loot that has already dropped.  Sure you want to create some arbitrary "on time" DKP boost. Go ahead. But based on that information I can tell you right now you're using a pretty badly outdated method of DKP and you'll probably run into issues with your loot policy down the road, nothing else withstanding. 
---
A punishment is something that is a retaliatory response to an unwanted action.
---
An incentive Is a pre established reward prior to something happening for designated behavior.
---
You cant say "50% dkp" and in the same breath try to call it an incentive.  Sorry this isnt Idaho, and you arent a politician at primaries, try your double speak bullshit somewhere else.
---
&gt;My guild had no lack of players
---
And yes, you will have a problem with players attendance. Regardless of the rules, rewards, punishment, whatever you want the #1 issue in any guild EVER FUCKING CREATED FOR ANY FUCKING GAME is player attendance to events in game.
---
Lastly you make some sweeping assumption that someone not showing up on time equates to lazy. (Yes you actually did. It's called Unity, Coherenece, Topic.  The 3 mainstays of a paragraph)  People who dont show up on time consistently may be lazy but it doesnt mean they are lazy.  Many times people who are identified as 'lazy' are in fact just bored or worse yet uninformed about whatever it is they should be doing.
---
If you want good raiders you make them aware, responsible, and communicative.  If you want a raid mule then sure, you continue to provide "incentives". I'm sure you'll have a nice pack of raid mules to whip before they get tired or frustrated.and leave your guild.
---
The fucking Russians man. Russian undead rogues are, for whatever reason, the biggest no life gankers I’ve ever seen.

Yeah 49 enhance shaman with Kang the Decapitator is super fun. I played one in BC.
---
People have been sporadically banned for using stuff like TMorph for a long time, ever since people realized you could do stuff like change the WSG flag into a Dark Portal, or one bug I believe that let you get places you weren't supposed to go. Even for people who want to dual wield Thunderfury on their L19 Twink, they sometimes got banned throughout the years. Sounds like another wave happened.
---
I'm aware of the issue and will provide a fix as soon as possible. Apologies for the inconvenience.
---
the counterpoint is kinda.. why do you feel entitled to get to participate in a stress test simply because you are interested in the end product? Definitely agree, i'd prefer to play the game for free, but this is a game that used to cost $60 on release and $15/mo to play that already has an IMMENSE amount of hype. They don't need to have a wide open stress test for their purposes, they have enough subs already to test what they want to test.
---
nope its a rank 60 cooking [Recipe: Thistle Tea] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18160/recipe-thistle-tea).
---
The best way to get Swiftthistle to make the tea is from Herbalism and gathering it from briarthorn or buying it from the AH.
---
Game time lasts a month so yes. The title is wrong the stress test in question is this coming wednesday.

I can offer Spanish translations should you need it!
---
Memes aside I'm not sure that even makes sense. If you're bad at pvp you're bad at pvp, the level isn't going to matter
---
/u/Krissam hit it pretty much on the head. Unless you are going hardcore PVP your PVE will work just fine. You might miss out the odd thing here and there but really unless you are 1v1-ing constantly you won't notice. AV for example is just a big old  raid in most cases. 
---
Small caveat is that depending on class/spec there may be small tweaks you can make for PVP that don't detract or have a detrimental impact on your PVE performance.
---
Not sure why I’m getting downvoted but there you go. The sound file mod just involved using a blank text file in the correct location. I would assume further modding would be required to play around with textures etc. Anyway, was just a thought. Cheers.
---
If it was a typo the whole sentence wouldnt make a sense...
---
It was fun to do both. Just queue up for some fun pub stomping, but the most fun was when we were grouped up and queued against other twink guilds on the other faction. 
---
But it really came down to the time investment as to why, I was slow at leveling and didn't even have a level 60 until late in BC while I had been twinking for a while with several different characters.
---
If you feel that you'll enjoy those classes then I don't see any reason to not play them.
---
If you want to mix it up then I'd recommend doing some research on how the multiple other classes play and see which one you might enjoy the most. Alternatively just pick a class based on a thematic you think sounds cool.
---
Personally, this is something that I'd like to have the option to do, because it's 100% client-side, wouldn't affect anyone else, and would add a bit of flair to the game. Seeing the same casting animation for hours and hours can get boring, which is why things like Noggenfogger, Savory Deviate Delights, and the Christmas Gnomes became so popular. But even if they don't that's okay.
---
Fine.. \*everyone who wants to pay for a shot at it. No more randomization.
---
Agree with that. I know first hand, as the game progresses it can be frustrating having a great geared warrior absolutely obliterate you. Or a druid that just wont die, hunter kite you to the moon... maybe it is because I was a holy Paladin:/
---
Haha! That got a laugh outta me.
---
If you don't sleep then sure.
---
Thank you!!! I could never find it and always wanted it
---
Never won the fish hat :/
---
Agreed, as anyone who twinks knows. All these people complaing are clueless people parroting streamers who also barely played in vanilla
---
I love how it makes even less sense with translation. :)
---
But yeah, you really shouldn't care.
---
Any other downsides or reasons you've regretted rolling PvP?
---
If you log in and get some where and die enough to get your 2 minute respawn.  Log out for 30 mins and try and watch a TV show or play an alt on a PVE server.  Come back and they should have moved on to the next poor player they want to abuse and corpse camp.
---
Or nelf racial
---
Don’t be stupid, nobody is going to pick a night elf over a dwarf because of that.
---
It didn’t and won’t work like that.
---
There isn't a lot of difference between twinks taking on regular toons of the same level as Naxx geared 60's fighting freshly minted 60's in quest greens with some dungeon gear.
---
Only 30 hours. Great advice to a self-proclaimed casual.
---
I think not understanding that certain crimes fall into a moral grey area because of their particular political effect (like piracy or theft of IP in this case) and generalizing it as “supporting crime” makes you a boot licker. Yes.
---
Piracy in most forms has always been illegal and yet has almost always worked to the benefit of the consumer. Golden age piracy altered costs for goods and disrupted national trading monopolies, internet piracy gave us the streaming platforms we know and love today and the music industry still hasn’t recovered from the profit loss. Granted this is small fry compared to that, but to not acknowledge the positive impact of the illegal action and it’s relative lack of human cost is disingenuous and very much a boot-lickers mentality.
---
I think the EQ comparison is helpful. I always felt WoW was the perfect iteration of the MMO genre, built off the success of previous games. Though, I strongly enjoyed many aspects of difficulty in Everquest (EQ), Asheron's Call (AC) (a personal favorite), and the other successful games before it released.  
---
I actually think naked corpse runs (you lose everything upon death) wouldn't have hurt WoW, albeit PVP servers would have been far more brutal. AC had a novel concept where you lost your 3-4 most valuable items upon death, which led to the concept of "death items" worth so much that your actual good items never were left on your body.
---
OP, you might enjoy the game Sentries of the Multiverse
---
I'm seeing a small number of bounced emails. Apologies for the inconvenience, I'll try to figure out what's happening.

I used allakhazam for the first half of vanilla and then switched to thott
---
One day we are questing, and someone was instant killing the Defias Traitor on the escort quest.  Bam he's alive, bam he's not, vanish, assasin is gone. Quest failed, wait 5 minutes and try again. Rinse and repeat for a few hours.  High level comes along and finally helps us out.. Rogue log outs, Druid logs in, Bam moonfire traitor dead again, this time from range, druid escapes.
---
Nothing makes you feel better than having someone 20 or more levels higher than you waste 5+ minutes to chase you down across 2 ore more zones to finally land a killing blow against you.
---
Nothing is worse than having someone that can instant kill you, follow you everywhere you go for hours just one shotting you every time you rezz.
---
As a 31 year old working 12 hour shifts with a 3 year old toddler and coaching a minor league team I already decided a strict "No Alt" policy for Classic.
---
I'll make a bank alt with enchanting and fire out Lesser Magic Wands like a factory worker but that's the extent of it.
---
Would rather focus on one character.
---
I'll try to tryhard a bit, so no, all my chars will have to have engineering.
---
Can you pm me more info like raid times current roster loot structure etc.
---
How was 49?
---
Only did 19 and 39
---
All I see is bad healers complaining that they’re bad. :O
---
FiTe mE
---
I got the fel fire... GIVE ME BETA
---
Even if you sleep 8 hours a day, that still gives you 96 hours to hit 60 in 6 days. It's doable with research and practice.
---
As a teacher I'm sad they are releasing this in my first day back to work....on the other hand at least I'll see outdoors this summer!
---
Thanks for the history lesson; I didn't know half of this! I'm honestly surprised they got rid of the minimum range as well.
---
Honestly I'd be fine with getting rid of all resources altogether and making everything free (sans arrows and their cost). Mana is an arbitrary limit that serves no useful purpose and doesn't make sense from a lore perspective. Hell I bet if you simply removed intellect and mp5 from all hunter gear and replaced it with ago/ap/crit you'd fix their scaling issues.
---
&gt; Only PvP you’ll find is in a BG and that’s not as fun for me personally
---
I've upvoted your comment, but I heard from those who have been playing on PvE servers that they did have wPvP.
---
Until chrome disables them in a couple months and I have to put a PiHole together, yeah.
---
&gt;vanilla buffs in tbc raids.
---
Not JUST that. They didn't want people to HAVE to raid Onyxia again just to raid Hyjal (they would raid Onyxia purely for the buffs as well because the gear was outdated - maybe you get the pack too)
---
Energy promotes hit and run tactics, use your energy, run out of melee to pool energy, reengage etc. It suits rogues fantasy perfectly.
---
The difference is that a twink lvl 19 will be literally unkillable for a lvl 19 that is just trying a WSG match while in leveling gear. A twink druid can have over 2000 hp while a leveling druid might have 400 hp. At lvl 60 this is a lot more normalized and there will be almost no one in garbage gear by that point. Someone in some lvl 50+ rares can still compete vs someone in rank 14 gear.
---
Yes they will.
---
No it's not an exploit. Yes it is a shit mechanic.
---
Just use Firefox, I switched like a year ago and didn't regret a thing.
---
I can only handle so many recurring monthly charges.
---
For some reason I'm not getting that to work with Atal'ai Spaulders? Other than that, awesome job, it looks great!
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I like the idea of making the "best" upgrades a bit more obvious. I think it could be similarly useful to display the best bang for your buck on BoE items in some way.
---
&gt; Someone in some lvl 50+ rares can still compete vs someone in rank 14 gear
---
lul

Science.
---
I just really hope Blizzard makes a server named Nostalrius when classic launches
---
Shaman heals, the watery animations are sweet.
---
Hearthstone casting: druids and shaman juking heals with hearthstones is just plain dumb, it's an unintended interaction resulting from an overworked design team, get rid of it.
---
Shift+mouse scroll gives you two more shorcuts. I used them for mount up, wolf form and/or anything else like that and shift + mouse 3,4 and 5 for Stun/shield, wolf form/rocket boots,  Self Heal and cleanse/purge etc
---
Do it the weekend before or plan out time before the 19th to do it
---
Can't believe its gonna be here before the football season :0
---
Either before phase 2 if I'm ready or after I'm done ranking. 
---
Proffesions will be herb + engi so i can farm money while relax herbing some time.
---
Maybe you’re right. Admittedly I have not played on a PvE server in a long, long time. 
---
That being said - the idea of having that much control of when you PvP (when you’re nice and ready) - just really takes away from the game for me.  I really like how alive the world feels when you know the enemy faction is nearby and dangerous. 
---
Being able to just say “nah I don’t feel like getting attacked today” seems so wrong to me lol
---
Real heroes think on their main.
---
Each launch is its own beast. No matter how many have come before, and how many will come after. Each launch is its own bag of tricks.
---
All of them.
---
I'm not kidding🙃
---
I think there will be 800k only wow classic subscribers.  I think there will be an additional 2 million modern wow players that will dabble in both to some extent each month.  Since they are on the same subscription, it is very easy to play some hours in modern and some in classic.
---
I mean, the amount of time they spent working on the project (who are clearly accomplished engineers) compared to the donations, It's probably not much at all, especially after server upkeep costs.
---
btw. league is trash
---
I would argue the shard is invaluable whereas the staff is relatively easily replaced.
---
For the authentic Blizzlike experience, they're going to implement regular server crashes and multi hour rollbacks.
---
You ready to repeat quests and lose that low drop chance blue BoE you found on a random mob?  That's the original vanilla experience.
---
&gt; Paying 50g to respec from your raiding spec to pvp for 2 days feels bad.  Some classes suck dick at PvP in their raid spec. Having a twink means  you can pvp whenever you want during the week. 
---
This is a really fair point actually. If respec costs become too expensive, I might make a twink as well.
---
And still, Blizzard didn't even consider to act.
---
UNTIL NOST
---
Lol. Dumbass
---
Oom for shadowpriest
---
Maybe an all paladin guild?
---
I only considered the things that mattered to me and by the time I’d finished writing my pros for warlock I found myself wanting to find more for lock than priest. It wasn’t the result of the list, more like flipping a coin to find out which side I wanted it to land on
---
Figured this'll come in handy for everyone planning to brave the stress test on Wednesday! Be prepared for zerginess.
---
But you responded to me (:
---
My apologies, I'm seeing bounced emails for some people. I'll try to find a solution asap.
---
Into Herod's blender with you.
---
Count me in!
---
most players spend most of their time leveling
---
the people here are not a good representation of the majority of players
---
As a hunter I've gotten flack for being body pulling and people shouting "huntard". Honestly I've come to realize besides accidentally pulling with my pet, its rarely my fault. Love it when the tank backtracks into my range constantly and then I'm constantly repositioning then my dps goes down plus I have my pet dismissed so that's a portion of my overall that's missing....
---
Hunters are misunderstood. Y'all other classes get to stand still. No pets to manage. I have 1 maybe 2 shots at CC and if you thunderclap my trap we all die.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I'll look into it.
---
I was being sarcastic. This is what twitch sounds like a lot of the time. I have no idea what pog even means. This was my way of agreeing with the subject of the post. Keep downvoting please. This sub reddit loves to down vote.
---
&gt; You originally said that people who show up late get half DKP. That is not an incentive, that is a punishment. 
---
The people who show up on time and stay all the way get double the DPK. Consequently, most people in the raids started showing up on time. Before the change, it often too an hour or more to start a raid because we were waiting for people to inconsiderate to show up on time.  Policy change worked and it worked well.
---
&gt;If someone shows up late, they are already missing out on the boss DKP/loot that has already dropped. 
---
My guild handed out DPK more for raid attendance and progression than they did per boss kill.  Killing a boss you've killed 10 times before was worth little compared to killing a new boss or making sure the raid ran on time.
---
&gt;Sure you want to create some arbitrary "on time" DKP boost. Go ahead. But based on that information I can tell you right now you're using a pretty badly outdated method of DKP and you'll probably run into issues with your loot policy down the road, nothing else withstanding. 
---
Guild's that let people show up late and delay the raid over and over again don't last long.  Some guilds handle the issue by not letting people into the raid at all if they're late.  Some handled with DKP incentives.  Others don't handle it at all, and the raiders who show up on time move onto other guilds with better leadership.
---
&gt;You're fucking retarded. Also you have zero concept of reality. 
---
No, you're just spewing insults to makeyourself feel better. I wonder what I triggered you with?
---
&gt;I raided back in 2004 with players who were parents when I myself was still single. I plan on raiding with parents again, especially now that I am one. As long as people communicate ahead of time and try not to make it a serial habit it's usually a non issue for many people.
---
It's an issue if the raid can't start on time because people are late.
---
Depends on how much my friends are playing. If we are all actually going for classic for real (as opposed to BfA), I will probably mostly play my main for a long time, basically until I have nothing else to do on it. 
---
But if my friends don't appear to want to play classic more than casually then I'll make an alliance alt on an another server pretty soon. Basically keep my horde char on par with my friends, and otherwise play my alliance char, which would possibly turn into my new main.
---
Really looking forward top the NPC reply, if he even does.
---
He sold more than 250,000 copies.
---
He's talking about minor league, as in sports, for kids ya troll.
---
Any alt I’m making is to think at 19 29 and 39.
---
I didn't down vote. I was just expressing my confusion.
---
My most embarrassing keybind is R for auto run (r as in run, get it?)
---
You want aggro? This is a good way to get aggro
---
It's almost like a company who runs on money is trying to make money.
---
I was mathing out the hours needed for a week 1 rag, and at first i thought it was going to be pretty tight, probably wouldn't happen. But i have a friend that is in a hard core guild coming in from a private server. He shared with me the level of planning they are putting into the launch....and it's insane. Sleep, grinding spots, dungeon groups, quest routes. Literally everything is planned out and assigned. And for every person they plan on being in the first raid they have 2 more people that will be doing all the scrub work like crafting and summoning the raid team around. They've already run MC as lv 58s in greens on personal test servers. The only way it doesn't happen is if their server crashes for a lengthy period of time.
---
Thats actually retarded.
---
I really don't see why so many people have such a boner for ret paladins, they're boring + do no damage. Its literally the worst of both worlds.
---
Fair enough, bust especially on a fresh server where people aren’t going to be bankrolling low level alts, stopping in at the AH every couple levels isn’t really feasible if you want your mount at 40, or to have good saved for actual BiS pre-raid gear come cap level.
---
Having a list of solid quest gear to aim for is a good idea. While none of the quests are “mandatory” per se, outside of maybe a handful like the level 30 warrior axe, it’s still nice to have those goals in mind.
---
This is especially true since you don’t want to drop silver or gold on a piece from the AH only to replace it with a blue quest reward an hour later.
---
I'll have a main and a bank alt. I might make a twink or two, but I was never really the alt leveling type.
---
One toon is enough time in Vanilla.
---
Instead of changing the classes themselves blizz Gould make new armory sets that benefit struggling specs
---
Tryhards are people who cannot NOT min/max the fun out of anything so this is false by definition
---
No lol
---
horrible tanks
---
Different things are better at different brackets. 19 ret paladin, 29 ret paladin, 39 ret paladin etc...
---
No current plans for contributors at the moment. I appreciate the interest and it's something I'll keep in mind!
---
Agreed.  I like vanilla but TBC added so many class improvements and honestly I find the music and dungeons way more immersive and challenging in TBC.
---
Lol warrior and a rogue? 
---
Blessing of protection 
---
See you dudes later
---
Replying to check this later since it sounds like a good fit for me.
---
You don't have a "pretty nice rig" if opening a website makes your PC lag lmao. It's not the tidiest website, but it doesn't lag if you have a "nice" rig
---
I didn't find it was any particular class that was lazier than others when it came to running to the instance or being at the raid on time.  I don't have any hate for rogues except on pvp servers where the level 60 rogues are stealthing around killing people in level 25 zones.
---
Somebody was. LOL!
---
&gt;I think not understanding that certain crimes fall into a moral grey area because of their particular political effect (like piracy or theft of IP in this case) and generalizing it as “supporting crime” makes you a boot licker. Yes.
---
This is a videogame. It isn't at all comparable to political change or stealing to feed your family.
---
&gt;I may be “pathetic” but you’re just flat out small minded. We wouldn’t even be having this conversation if not for the folks you’re demonizing as simple criminals.
---
And I wouldn't be anti-car-theft if car-theft didn't exist. Duh...
---
And if they weren't you would Scorpid sting.
---
X2
---
Use uBlock Origin.
---
When the level, icon, and rank text are all greyed out, that means those talents have already been learned.  If you scroll down, you should see non-greyed ones.
---
When the icon is transparent but the level and rank text are not grey, that means you're on the wrong tab for that talent.
---
Leveling to 60 in wow is 12-15 day experience for most players.  That's 288-360 hours.  30 hours is about 0.08% of that amount of time.  It's not unreasonable when playing a game like wow.
---
Agreed. In my experience, these lazy folks are the minority of raiders. Starting out in MC, you can afford to pull trash without a full raid group, so I wouldn't require three people to run out to summon a person who didn't show up on time without good reason. Those people can run just like the rest of us, and risk missing out on trash or a raid spot. 
---
I am considering making this part of the loot council decision process in my guild. Pure attendance doesn't paint the full picture when some people are always at the instance at raid time and others are constantly logging in 1 minute prior and begging for summons.
---
"Reflect on this while you run back" - me when I healed
---
What source do you have on that?
---
I thought you had crabs. Double congrats for not having them and for getting that motivation in your life !
---
Literally just text my buddy that we should find a guild called &lt;Dads with Jobs&gt;. 
---
The name doesn't matter as much as the idea, so I like it. I'm sure we could find enough others on a similar stage of life.
---
Eh, just saw EU, so unfortunately we won't be able to play together, but I do love the idea. Good Luck!
---
I've got a Pixel and they've got me with the password/autofill sharing across platforms. I kinda want to try and rig a Pi Zero W and battery bank into a mobile DNS server anyway.
---
I use several browsers for different things, but on my phone and work computer for example it's usually chrome. I've had love for Firefox since it was just Mozilla, though.
---
Same here, I have needed a good reason to take a long vacation for awhile now.  This certainly fits the bill
---
I think the toggle idea is actually brilliant.
---
Not necessarily looking to play the Beta. Just pointing out that OPs title might not have been too optimal.
---
I'll add that to my list of things to look in to. There are still some data issues in some places that need ironing out and it looks like that might be one of them.
---
Read the comment I'm replying to before you downvote me. They were talking about stats and damage.
---
Returning players and BFA crossovers are anxious that they are going to be dominated by knowledgeable private server players come release.
---
LeAgUe Of LeGeNdS iS tRaSh ThAt Is AlL i HaVe To AdD
---
Was gonna say this lol
---
I know you can do it because you stuck with BFA for 2 months. I didn't make it 20 minutes before I logged out.
---
This is amazing! Thank you very much for your service! The only thing I was hoping for would be a armor type option? Like for paladin, I could restrict it to only show mail and plate for holy. Or maybe I can and I'm not seeing this? Thanks again either way
---
Invite please. I need one for Balance lol
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Birds Of A Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
**What we are looking for:** Someone who is dedicated. We require 80% attendance otherwise you may be subbed out. We understand things happen but just don’t make a habit of it. Someone who can raid on Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 7PM/8PM EST to 10PM /11PM EST. Someone with a good attitude, doesn’t rage, and doesn’t complain. Someone who is willing to help others and is team-focused and not individual focused. Someone who is competent, willing to learn, and ask questions if they don’t understand so they can do it right.
---
**How we operate:** As stated above we will be raiding two days a week from 7-10PM EST on Tuesday and Thursday. As for loot we will be running Loot Council. The team will decide how to distribute loot based on several factors including (but not limited to): Attendance, performance in raids (Moreso your ability to listen and do mechanics as opposed to pulling high numbers.), what you contribute to the guild (helping other players, crafting/enchanting things for people, etc.),  and just helping the guild in general.
---
**What we are recruiting:** You can see what we are recruiting for on our website. Currently we have a high need for ranged DPS/healers
---
You can contact me on discord @ frail\_#3482
---
Here is our App: [https://boaf.enjin.com/recruitment](https://boaf.enjin.com/recruitment)
---
And here is our discord: https://discord.gg/nBG8kB
---
How did this get removed? It’s not in violation of rule 2?????
---
you cannot be that stupid.
---
If dps pulling causes you to wipe, its probably best to warn them beforehand that you aren't a very experienced tank. Then people can take it slow or leave the group before starting.
---
&gt;288-360 hours. 30 hours is about **0.08%**
---
That's not how math works my friend. You either say .08 or 8%. And that's still quite a lot of time to invest.
---
Probably best to delete and remake the thread with correct informations in the title, OP.
---
Get the raid leader to make just a few spots for being summoned, any one else needing it gets minus DKP, or maybe a gold fee. Don't worry, I'm not a raid leader. :-P  
---
On the flip side, maybe give some points for those who help the Warlock summon people.
---
XD
---
For a casual I really think a PVP server is the way to go. There's always things to do and you don't need to raid top tier content to be effective. What class are you playing? You won't need to be in a healer spec to be a decent healer while levelling.
---
America First baby!
---
Funny how there's a bunch of people commenting and helping him complete his build.
---
Why are you this stupid?
---
Just ask for time off...bullshit a reason if you need to. Don't tell em it's for a game.
---
There was a time where I would get more awe out of someone by telling them I created the Thottbot logo than all my work at Westwood Studios.
---
I am lucky that I work Friday - Monday. I get off Monday about 4 hours before Classic is suppose to release, and then have the next 3 days to do nothing else. 
---
I have some vacation time that I have to use by the end of the year or I lose it. I might take that Friday and Saturday off for some more gaming time, but not really sure yet.
---
this is gonna get buried but whatever
---
this was me in vanilla, and i ended up eventually getting poached along with a couple other ppl to the top guild on our server during SSC/TK in TBC.  never looked back, never regretted the move.  unless your casual guild is extraordinarily lucky/charismatic, this is how you're eventually going to lose your hard carries.
---
it was a good time with great people while it lasted in vanilla and early TBC but as one of the "tryhards" of my former casual guild...it wears on you.  Raids go by, months go by, new expansion releases, and you realize that there's like 5-6 people basically just carrying ~25 friends and family, with a dash of new recruits.  And that's how it was since day one.  
---
It's great for a long time, it still felt amazing to down big bosses with your guild even if you were months behind (I'll never forget our first Rag kill), but eventually the people who put in the time and effort to be the best at what they're doing are going to start watching those other guilds, seeing them effortlessly push through content that their casual guild just can't seem to crack after months of trying...these players will start to wonder if there's more out there for them.
---
The guys who just like being top dog wherever they are might stick with the casual guild, but the players who really care about pushing themselves and pushing content - it's a ticking time bomb.  That's just the nature of progression raiding, and even more so in vanilla, where the relative difficulty and time requirement of the content and 40 man raiding means that a lot of times even just having 40 reliable people show up every raid night is part of the challenge.  
---
You might be fine with it now, even fine with it 6 months from now, but when progression goes from spending 5-6 hours a week on MC/Ony to slamming your face into Twin Emps, Cthun, 4H etc and it's like pulling teeth just to get even 30 properly geared and prepared raiders to show up for another night of repair bills and no loot, yet 45+ show up for easy farm nights in BWL...people and mentalities are going to clash.  That's just what happens when people begin to have (or have always had) different priorities.  
---
At the time I wanted nothing more than my casual guild to breakthrough, make it, be one of the top guilds on the server.  Took all of vanilla and early TBC for me to realize that would never happen, because at the end of the day, casual guilds and tryhard players do not have the same goals, and they likely never will.
---
If you really like PvP and have lots of time to play. Go on a PvP server. 
---
If you don't have that much time to waste and primarily focus on PvE, going on a PvE server is a good option. It will save you a lot of time and frustration when trying to do normal PvE stuff. Only drawback is you get less PvP when out and about, which for some people is not even a drawback, so there's that.
---
Am I missing something, isn't this how it already is?
---
Really? Lol
---
Anti-twink mentality is so retail-mentality. See what they just did to twinks in 8.2?
---
Twinking is a classic feature.
---
I am debating even logging in. Curiosity might get the better of me.
---
Granted but then they probably shouldn't complain about me pointing this out on a meme about doing high lvl dungeons.
---
just buy a drinking bird toy.
---
awesome. sounds good. do you have any questions or anyhting?
---
Thats depressing lol.
---
Interesting, I'll have a look at the level 1 issue.
---
On changing levels, it is possible to do that by editing a character (cog icon on cards in character list page). It could probably be done a bit better though for scenarios where you keep bumping it up as you level, like you said. Thanks for the feedback.
---
It’d be cool to mess around with while also not having an account...
---
Mods should start deleting these karma whoring posts tbh
---
''Why do all Hyena's look alike''
---
But I love orcs, its got me leaning toward shaman.
---
Btw
---
I am probably going to be hyper focused on a single character as I don't have all the time in the world to play like I did in vanilla.
---
What do you think they should get in return? lol
---
Minimally, but I'll probably level an alt to the point where they get to the first inn pretty much right away and park them there.
---
Then I'll log onto them here or there if I feel like it and ride the rested XP.
---
Really nice site I like it a lot! Only issue I’m having is when you go to create a set and you grab a premade set and select wether to include raid or quest etc.. and save it. I can’t seem to figure out how to edit these specific options of the set without deleting it and making a new one.
---
Usually people don't want two of the same class/role in a 5-man because they are competing for the same gear.
---
If we're just farming an instance for gear, I'd take a retadin over a second rogue out of respect to the first rogue. If it takes 10 extra minutes to clear, so be it. That's better than your BiS item dropping and losing the roll to rogue #2.
---
You are right, if it was everywhere he wouldn't bother mentioning regions. Maybe they aren't worried about EU and need to test us and oce servers more.
---
An experienced DPS does not pull for the tank, if you're causing problems for the group i'll sit you down and ask you to stop, if you continue you can find another group that might put up with you. Mine will not.
---
&gt; This is a videogame. It isn't at all comparable to political change or stealing to feed your family.
---
You conspicuously ignored my mention of internet piracy. I presume you believe everyone who’s illegally downloaded music should be jailed and/or fined as far as allowed based on local statutes?
---
The back-end is a serverless architecture on AWS. DynamoDB, ElasticSearch, AppSync, Cognito would be the main services. React/Apollo on the front-end.
---
I played a Hunter to the mid 30's as my first character until I had a mid-game crisis and decided to change my (wow)life. I realized my Need rolls on everything and generally shitty 16 year old attitude had a bad effect (didn't help I was a NE with an edgelord name).
---
I then realized everyone liked Warriors...especially ones who tanked. So I decided to clean up my act.
---
I rolled a human with a clean haircut, a setting fitting name, and taught myself to tank.
---
I have never looked back. Learning to tank in MMO's almost always guarantees you'll make friends and it taught me to be way more patient while also learning to understand how my team works.
---
For my 16 year old self, it turned out to be a huge life lesson. So yeah, probably going to go back to that (with a healer alt).
---
A modern server is essentially a handful of scripts they run on some amazon hosting interface (or whatever they use). It's not like the old days where you had to actually get a machine setup in a rack, it's all just hosted virtually in a cloud. The hardest part is probably thinking up the name.  
---
The problem with Classic really though is we know the dropoff will be huge, and having empty servers is a far bigger problem than overcrowded ones, so hence the use of layering and why being able to spin up lots of servers doesn't really help.
---
And there a lot less people attempting it...
---
I just RP in Goldshire
---
Thanks mate
---
&gt; And that's still quite a lot of time to invest.
---
If you say so sport.
---
But still, if you campaigned for something and worked hard for it and finally get it, it doesn’t mean you personally got compensated for your work
---
Im working 70 hours a week and im playing pvp server, it aint wow if im in a pve server.
---
I'll be leveling two or three Alts as I level my main. Whenever I feel a need a break from my main, I'll switch. Rested xp is the bomb.
---
&gt;As a busy parent, if I set aside time to raid, I want to make sure I am not sitting around waiting for other people to show up.
---
No guild I've ever been with the entire time I've raided in any game has ever sat around twiddling their thumbs when raid time comes.  Unless you're missing a critical piece of your team (i.e. main tank, healer, raid leader, raid officer) most of the time they just start and let people filter in over the next couple minutes.  
---
Also, I've never seen any parent ever start a sentence with "as a busy parent". So your statement lends itself to some incredulity on my part. Adults can be busy without kids FYI.  Parenting does not automatically equate to being busy.  
---
Trust me, my 8 year old doesn't need me watching her every minute.  Beyond the age of 7, they tend to be able to do most things themselves and only really come to you for the two infamous questions of "when is &lt;lunch/dinner/snack&gt;" and "I'm bored" or most recently "Netflix isn't working, can you fix it?".  
---
And for the record, your guild can start clearing trash and EVEN the first few BOSSES in MC quite easily with 20-30 people.  So, if you're guild is waiting around for a perfect "full 40" you should probably find yourself a guild that has a competent raid leader/guild leader.
---
I don't know about specific subs. But I'm pretty sure it will have a similar ebb and flow to the server populations as retail has. When new stuff is released, people come back, and then leave as they get bored of the new stuff. 
---
That wasn't really a thing in vanilla, but I think it's mostly a gaming culture thing, there's a lot more other games people can realistically go play now than there was back in the 2000s. 
---
Obviously the time investment needed to accomplish stuff in classic is greater than in retail, but it's not great enough to maintain a steady population throughout it's lifespan.
---
Not only is he not talking about the game, your opinion makes no sense. How can one of the most popular games over the last 10 years be trash?
---
I do say so friend.
---
suck /u/borick23's dick, zygor
---
Within the 1st week i'll level my alt to 5 and move them to their main city to learn enchanting and tailoring so i can ship my BoE's and cloth to it to stock pile mats.
---
I'll also make a human bank alt and corpse run westfall and swim to BB so i can sell stuff on the neutral AH.
---
It’s incredibly annoying when the guy who wants a summon is the guy in Tanaris tho.
---
A great suggestion. There is currently only filtering available for 1H/2H when you're selecting an item. There are a number of things that could use some improving around that filter UI, so I'll keep this one in mind when I make improvements there.
---
And money from deals with gold/account/item sellers lol
---
yup, a lot of new ppl just cant stand any mention of private servers. wonder why?
---
I’m going to be against the grain here and say that no, being a casual player and playing on PVP is a nightmare. If you are a casual player, it’s probably because you have many real life responsibilities and don’t have much time to play WoW. If that’s the case, you may lose significant time you could be spending leveling to being killed repeatedly.
---
We would ask in guild chat if anyone wanted the water they had unused. I also used to bribe people to mule water over to my alts from my mage main too.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Ya, there are certainly some data issues here and there that I'm still trying to iron out. I'll make note of this one.
---
305 is the most important and that comes from talent.  310 vs 305 is 10% more white damage on your glancing blows.  Has a few more smaller bonuses too. That amounts to only a couple %dps increase.  So it really isnt that important to go human for rogues.
---
Also, any one individual doing this is bound to have issues with so many people on the same quests at the same time. It will eventually thin out but the first 20 levels or so won’t be as quick as possible because you will be waiting for respawns
---
Doesn't make it less true.
---
I willing to go to great lengths to be lazy.  In one query I want to get a list of Best In Slot Items for each class for each level.  I want the data dump to include the quest name, quest giver, zone, recipe, etc...  I got the classic-db-master running locally with mysql.  So I should be able to get what I need.
---
I am very biased here. In my opinion only a PvP realm can give you the "full WoW experience". I don't even acknowledge that PvE servers exist. I completely understand some people have zero interest in PvP and that's fine.
---
The constant threat of danger is what makes it great in my mind. It's not for everyone. You will give as good as you get so it balances pretty well if you are a halfway decent player.
---
Ahh so you will be leveling with all the people who reroll off of warrior
---
😂
---
Yeah exactly. It's easier to outgear people and so you don't have to rely on skill to win. 
---
It's a bit like pay to win games. Having a rich main gear up a twink is not so different from using irl money to gear up your main.
---
you got what you wanted, what else do you want a fucking trophy?
---
Thank you brother, appreciate it
---
I don't know where you're pulling that from. All of the top PvPers on the v2/v3 ladders of my Battlegroup were Horde during all of WotLK, and so they were on other battlegroups. And in the top 10 temas, among them like 80% of the classes that could play undead were undead.  RMPs in particular, past 2k4, were pretty much always 3/3 undead. Guys like Reckful or Snutz were the exception, not the rule. I do not remember ever hearing about a top PvPer min maxing racials.
---
During Cata I remember a lot of Human Warriors and Human Rogues, but that is coincidental with how OP moments these classes had back then, and how most of the people interested in PvP, who until then played Horde, gradually started leaving the game.
---
Also, a way to turn World Drop off!
---
Thing is, people who play bad specs tend to be clueless about the game in general.
---
Chances are the guy who picked ret pally isn't a stubborn skilled player. He just thought it sounded cool and never looked at a guide.
---
I have a feeling the dynamic respawns are going to be almost instant in the starting zones. Even with layering.. the launch will be gnarly. Classic launch will separate the boys.. from the men.
---
Same. Doubt I will start playing seriously for a week or so after launch.
---
You’ll want to layer hop to the least crowded layer and then just play as normal.
---
You might like retail sir
---
Jokes on you i dont even play this game
---
I'm a huge fan of jumping off cliffs with my pet summoned. That or have him on aggressive and auto cast growl.
---
As we saw with the level 30 and now 40 cap on beta. Lower level brackets can have entirely different metas, based on skills/talents available at the time, profession skill level cap available, Hell twink metas can be warped because certain classes get a really strong item in that bracket (Whirlwind Axe warriors for example).
---
Level 60 PvP is gonna have plenty of people looking to optimize it. Twinking gives the ability to have a more unexplored puzzle, creativity from constraints of your limited tools available, and even if it is all solved, some people might just prefer a Meta where Hunters are Tier 1 and warriors are weak. as they think it makes the bg's play out differently around that.
---
A whole group using them can often prevent a wipe. It's like a big aoe heal for no mana.
---
It does include set bonuses in the stat totals if they are simple +stats. I haven't gotten into assigning values to the more complex bonuses/procs/effects/etc. as it's not so straightforward to put a number on. It's something I'd like to support in some way, but it needs some more thought.
---
I dont get it? You ask for them to do something, they did and its depressing?
---
You’re completely right. Unfortunately that was the only way to get Blizzard’s attention :/
---
The totems make it special. I can cast healing touch and chain heal all day as long as I have other things to keep track of.
---
Shamans are overplayed, so druid is great. And moo is life.
---
What faction race will you role?
---
No worries mate, I wouldn't want you getting the day wrong for such a big release!
---
Funny how they're giving him a bunch of advice he made pretty clear in OP he's uninterested in....
---
"let him die"
---
And how does inflating random streamers help the "common goal"?
---
I do this too. For me I'm just used to staying mobile in pvp. It's almost like a tic that doesn't go away when you pve. I strafe less but, I don't seem to be able to eliminate the habit completely.
---
I hope people aren't seriously suggesting they be monetarily compensated for running a private server? I mean... god bless those guys for being a huge factor in getting classic WoW but outside of that? Want a pat on the back or something?
---
Thanks! There is nothing explicitly supporting PvP sets at the moment, but you could certainly create custom EPs that assign additional value to stamina or anything else you value higher for PvP.
---
19 BiS is still somewhat hard to get. Fishing tournament at level 19 is tough to win. Gurubashi Arena is tough to steal, or you log in at down hours.
---
Yes they were, just not over 63, you could still stack all buffs and enter raids.
---
But they didnt want people to use vanilla buffs in TBC raids.
---
Is it really just Blizzard being a protective parent? or are they trying to "crack down" on macros/scripts and claim it's a bannable offense?
---
I have been limiting my macros in the beta because I am super fearful that I'll get in trouble.  Also, this sub is pretty rude and downvote-heavy to all threads regarding this type of question for some reason - so thank you for your response
---
Don't sweat it man. It's a good project to work on, and you never know if people might prefer your addon to the alternatives.
---
&gt;You conspicuously ignored my mention of internet piracy. I presume you also believe everyone who’s illegally downloaded music should be jailed and/or fined as far as allowed based on local statutes?
---
People who download illegally should be fined, since that's intellectual property crime.
---
&gt; Do you also think we’d be better off without Apple Music and Spotify? 
---
No? What does legally buying music have to do with this?
---
&gt;Just so I know the kind of person I’m dealing with.
---
One who doesn't like to commit crime?
---
Short answer - Absolutely, sure. Why not?
---
Long answer: It's complicated. I enjoyed the high skill ceiling that the deadzone created. Arguably I'd prefer there to be a melee zone, a ranged zone, and nothing in between. All day. But, there is something to be said about being recognized/remembered as a genuinely good hunter (for PvP or PvE) and getting instant invites for not being Huntard #2398.
---
Well it's a stress test for us in the EU as well, managing our stress of not being able to play.
---
I think they have shown it to be broken in the beta. That being said Tauren reach is actually 7 feet as opposed to the standard 5. That's working as intended.
---
Ive beeb very excited for classic for over 2 years now before they announced it. As of late I really could care less escpcially when I heard the release date. I have classes I need to worry about which is way more important than this game. Been playing path of exile to get that kind of fix but really just tend to stop caring after the first week of each league. Having clear goals set for myself really has made me care less for games as a whole.
---
You will be the healer well before max level.
---
Spec doesn't matter much while leveling, so in most group content you will get asked to heal.
---
Haha now that you point it out the title is suggestive like that 😂
---
Seinfeld theory
---
Owl is the best leveling pet.
---
However many subs WoW currently has. Times two.
---
Take this ideology to an extreme but maintain the foundation, when black people got the vote or gay people got marriage, would you react the same way towards the ones who campaigned the hardest and fought the most?
---
No, you elevate them, that doesn’t necessarily mean a trophy, just recognition and hey maybe some financial compensation for all those hours spent for a community.
---
For alliance human zone will likely be a write off. You definitely have a better shot with nelf
---
I'll play! That sounds awesome.
---
Ahh that's true of course. lol
---
People pvp at max level because they are too shit to get gear from raiding...change my mind
---
Oh yeah man it was a hard 2 months! It was like trying to play with a dead dog, something you used to love but now it's just upsetting
---
It wasn’t legal, but it sure as hell wasn’t immoral or a wrong thing to do.
---
A mage novaing loose mobs on top of the healer is reactionary.  
---
A mage who novas them when they've peeled off the tank and are halfway to the healer is proactive. Bonus points if it gets a melee whacked.
---
Thats true but i’ll just give mining or herb a shot. I’ll not ignore nodes, but just not walk around looking for them in areas where i don’t have quest or are farming mobs
---
I started in BC. After some experiments mained a Hunter all through Wotlk. The more I think I will
---
main a hunter.
---
But i Cata I switched to warrior. I liked it. Might try it as an alt.
---
And you know, rogues have a lot of interesting class perks..
---
Same as warlocks..
---
But maybe I could try a mage?
---
Or heal as a shaman?
---
Or maybe different class/faction hunter?
---
Or how about a priest?
---
Or a druid?
---
Dude you’re trying too hard and it’s cringe as fuck. It’s a rpg dude. It screams rpg. It’s ridiculous that I’m even having this conversation when it’s clearly a god damn rpg. Get your head out of your ass dude. If it’s such a problem for you to understand maybe you should go play call of duty which is obviously a board game based on your logic right? How about we play that awesome racing game Spyro the dragon? Or a great dating sim like anthem? If we’re just making shit up why not go all out?
---
Try hard on main, min max my rested experience on alt after level 15
---
I loved my main then, but I want to main something different this time around.  Also, I was Ally then and will be leveling Horde this time.
---
Yeah but everyone following Joana's guide means that it is kinda shit unless you are ahead of the pack.
---
dealsheals is a great name
---
I am still in awe, my friend, thank you for your contribution.
---
I never laughed at them.
---
I played evercrack for a spell and understood.
---
Thanks! The breakdown lists you see below the gear selection was an attempt to provide this to some degree, but I think there's still more that could be done to highlight the best things to do for the biggest upgrades. Something I'll give some more thought. Appreciate the feedback!
---
For horde you can play 2h fury in PvE, it is very viable due to windfury.  
---
You never play arms in PvE due to Mortal strike eating up a debuff slot. Even if you play dual wield or 2h you always spec fury.  
---
If you want to do both PvE and PvP you are going to have to re-spec in to raids for fury and for pvp arms. Because you simply cannot use Mortal strike in a raid ever for it eating up a debuff slot.
---
No. I also never laughed at EQ players.
---
Huh. I’d always heard that cats were he best leveling pets. That makes me feel better, xD.
---
Definitely. Very few things are more annoying than starting from Un'goro crater for a BRD run and noticing another party member sitting in Iron Forge and upon reaching BRD, finding that same party member still in Iron Forge asking "Summon please". Honestly, when I get to the instance and have two helpers available, you better damn well be on a gryphon or wyvern heading towards the instance if you expect a summon.
---
I played to level 14, and did not understand.  Combat seemed way too random.
---
Lol, sure, it’s “morally grey” if it benefits you? That’s awfully convenient.
---
I never laughed at people, who enjoyed playing older games. Seems like you were part of the assholes back then. Let people enjoy what they want, as long as they don't hurt anybody.
---
LOL well this is just conflating at this point.
---
I'm not OP but it's ludicrous to assume that because he thinks receiving donations for stolen IP is theft he must also think that people who pirated a song are criminals. The correct analogy would be if someone pirated music and then reuploaded them as a pirate but took donations and built a community around using said music.
---
You'd be an idiot to not consider that a crime. You'd be a bigger idiot to try and claim it's not a crime and that everyone who doesn't agree with you is a bootlicker.
---
While I'm sure some people did it for fun and really enjoyed twink vs twink premades, I'm pretty sure i recall a lot of twinkers complaining about Patch 3.2.0 and I a lot of the people in my guild that did twink stopped.
---
 People would still say Prot Pali was not viable though.
---
My job allows me to cancel vacation and add it to the end on the fly. I'll be able to manage.
---
The Netherlands second!
---
I found the guy still playing retail
---
Classic WoW.
---
It doesn’t have to be that way. OSRS is able to build solid progression and horizontal content while keeping past content relevant. It simply needs strong design principles and community checks such as polling
---
😁😁😂😂
---
The "catalyst" is something that starts or triggers an event. Folks have been asking for an official vanilla re-release for a long time before Nost even existed.
---
Thanks! That one is intentional as it was added in patch 1.4, so it should be phase 2 as far as we know right now. If this turns out to be wrong it will be updated.
---
&gt; Why wait so long to remove a simple mechanic if it wasn't working as intended 
---
This is also addressed in the Melderon video. They weren't removed until TBC because the player base wasn't abusing them at the time. Blizzard included the world buffs, but they never planned on guilds basing so much of their raid strategy around having them. Stacking world buffs didn't even become a prevalent practice until the rise of pservers, as confirmed by the officers of Death &amp; Taxes. 
---
So, since no one was abusing them, Blizzard had no real incentive to have resources working to change the way world buffs worked. They could have been used as exploits, but they weren't. 
---
Your comparison of world buffs to flasks doesn't really make a lot of sense. You can't stack every type of flask, and even if you could, many classes wouldn't see a huge benefit in doing so. Farming for flasks doesn't change the way that the game works nor does it discourage you from playing your main character. 
---
&gt; This is all coming from someone that will rarely, if ever, utilize this game mechanic. 
---
Here's the thing. Most players still won't be affected by this, either way. There is a section of the community that will try to get every advantage available, though, and collecting world buffs will end up being an additional burden on some of those players. I think that the original vid that OP linked does a really good job unpacking all of this.
---
Without cross realm battlegrounds, I am interested to see if there will be enough people to do level 19 BGs.
---
Pick a class first then go with that- each zone will be packed but humans and undead will be the most packed.
---
If you 100% are certain you'll level both a Hunter and mage, do hunter first :)
---
Found an important issue. On lower level characters, it's suggesting items that are higher level, or wrong faction.
---
Nice overall, would be cool to be able to see item models.
---
This is going to be some unconventional advice, but if you want to learn how to be a great hunter dont tank with your pet. And PvP a lot 
---
So many people go from 1-60 being a DPS turret behind the pet tank.  It doesn't teach you how to kite, how to trap, how to manage your distance, your multi shots, your pet pathing, your pathing. 
---
FD offers up so many options, traps, drinks, trinket/gear swaps, bandages, threat resets.
---
You're the only class with a ranged taunt AND an agro dump. It's possible to kite multiple mobs in a dungeon if the tank dies. You can FDtrap one, taunt another, and have a pet tank a third.
---
For CC you have a ranged slow, a ranged snare, a ranged stun, a melee slow, a melee snare, a melee stun, a pet stun. Oh and traps. 
---
Add in a Mana drain, a -hit debuff, and an enrage dispell.
---
@ level 44 you are half way done.
---
Right, you can’t walk two steps without someone asking for LFR right?
---
Honestly this is the craziest straw man I’ve seen. Find me a single person asking for LFR on this subreddit, I dare you.
---
Honestly I havent played since 02-03. Couldnt even tell you what the combat was like.
---
Uhh I am the source, I play on EU servers. If you want something more "reliable" go to twitch find any EU streamer and watch them play on the same server as the US streamers. I dont know when they started doing it like this as my first beta invite was cataclysm but litterally every single beta and PTR since cata has been happening on US servers.
---
Thanks! There are some ways to achieve this now. If you use the autofill option after creating a set, you could uncheck "Raid" and "World Bosses" to get a good starting point for a pre-bis set. There is also a filter button in the top right corner when you're selecting an item that lets you similarly filter by source.
---
When Mists of Pandaria released I remember telling my boss I was using my vacation time and would not be reachable by phone or email. 
---
Him: but you’ll be at your home the whole time on your computer?
---
Me: Yes, but you should pretend I am on an international cruise with no cell reception and no internet.
---
Him: Are you going on a cruise?
---
Me: No, but for one week I’m not talking to any of you about anything going on here. Burn this to the ground for all I care.
---
Aw the blissful beauty of youth and ignorance. That boss was very patient with me. lol
---
I may be in the minority here but even given I played WoW even back in its beta stage I never even thought about leveling or questing efficiency. I always just kinda of looked at zones I was interested in completing and dungeons that I was interested in doing or my friends wanted to do and went from there.
---
I always took a leisurely stroll through the game. Only time I ever rushed on a fresh server I ended up having to wait a week or two for everyone to catch up so we could actually raid.
---
Take your time, absorb the world... or speed run through it. Whatever is most fun for you I guess.
---
People are going to have to learn the concept of LOS pulls too. I've tried doing that on retail to pull a room full of casters and the rest of the group had no concept of what I was doing and stood in line if sight.
---
No one can predict the future. That being said I think it will grow. I don't think we will need to be worried about shrinkage. Literally every skeptic, I have seen who got into the beta. Is now a true believer. The most famous one I can think of is Venruki. 
---
Classic is so unique and nothing else on the market is anything like it. For this reason alone it will prolly go hamburgers.
---
yes, right from the start.. that's confirmed.
---
Gotta be the first to get that karma
---
Is that a caster thing? On my main mage that is always the case, but on my warrior nobody talks shit about the other dps. 😔
---
It's still a wrong and immoral thing to do even if it has good results. It isn't good to steal another persons/companies intellectual property and then make money off of it.
---
Just because you personally benefit from it that doesn't make it ok.
---
Not in vanilla sir
---
According to Joana (The world record vanilla speed leveller) cats are actually better for solo leveling when pulling 1 mob at a time but Owls are good for dungeons and groups.
---
gotcha. ya, no way you could do that through the url requests. a pretty intense query could do the job. Someone shared this website today as well. i've been poking at it and it does a pretty good job of picking BIS for each class/spec/level. would need an extra step to get the source in think, but maybe in combination with a query will get you there. [https://sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com/)
---
on private servers it wasn't 1 drain/mob but I can't speak for the beta. and no you don't need to deal the killing blow
---
At least on private servers at the moment everything is just dead all the time. You run from area to area and its just empty since there are 100 other people trying to farm the same items. I hope they do something about this on the live classic servers.
---
Huh I guess I was thinking of TBC then
---
Weak numbers
---
Enough time to play &amp; get stuff for twink, not enough to be on raids/premade bgs.
---
Plus, when I reached 60 I had bad lvl 50 green stuff against T2/R14 gears, soooo, hard to demonstrate your skill
---
You're not friend Buddy.
---
In the stress test I saw one mage making a mob run endlessly by hopping over a low fence. Pathing tricks are probably going to work.
---
It isn’t stealing, it’s copying. Stealing removes it from the owner. Blizzard wasn’t using the IP so they weren’t even taking potential customers. Also, most people playing the game bought a copy of vanilla back in the day. They’re just using something they already paid for. 
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong or immoral about it. Laws don’t dictate morality.
---
Yes I am glad wow is finally coming back, I can’t wait to play wow classic. Still hoping to get into beta
---
The world record as I understand it is around 3.8 days played. So it's possible but, unlikely.
---
&gt; and community checks such as polling
---
Right, a flawed system where less than 25% of the playerbase even votes.
---
&gt; horizontal content
---
Horizontal content would work, but any kind of vertical progression would destroy the game by making earlier content artificially gate-keeping.
---
Game time means /played.  
---
Real Time means /played +  time not played
---
Except you’re likely tank warrior won’t want the ret there for the same reason lol
---
You might be just what i'm looking for. I mained a holy priest Vanilla - WotLK and I'll be doing the same thing for Classic. I have On, MC, ZG, AQ, BWL &amp; Naxx experience as priest officer responsible for handling training, DKP distribution / bidding for the priests.
---
I was also guild alchemist with elixer specialization for flasks.  
---
I plan on rolling Dwarf Priest w/ enchanting &amp; alchemy. I'd love to join if you guys will be running dungeons for leveling and getting BIS gear, pre-raid. I would prefer to do nothing but run 5-mans all the way to 60. 
---
I hated questing as a priest but loved healing dungeons to level up and stay geared.
---
The raid times are almost perfect for me. I put my kids to bed at 7:30c. And I usually stay up until midnight.
---
I haven't played hardcore since WotLK, though. I stopped playing after Ulduar. 
---
I may need to get a more comfortable chair.
---
Does it cost an additional 30 coppers per item?
---
I guess my concern is that that "taking my time" by trying to quest in the starting zones will just result in me waiting for hours to complete a simple quest as hundreds of people try to attack the same mob as it spawns.
---
I'm imagining that this will be the craziest a starting zone has ever been in WoW, especially something like humans which is what I want to play.
---
Even crazier than the original launch. Because now WoW already has a massive playerbase ready to hit the start button at the exact time of launch, and everybody knows where to go and what to do to quest at the start.
---
These were the first to come to my head and surprised nobody mentioned them:
---
-Vanquisher Sword + Amberglow Talisman
---
If you're Allliance,
---
-Vanquisher Sword + Sword of Serenity
---
-SM weapon quests (bonebiter is nuts)
---
-Vanquisher Sword + Sword of Omen
---
Id bet most the people in beta right now dont report or document bugs. Id want someone that demonstrates that they can report bugs in my beta
---
&gt; Yeah that video is SO wrong, it would take a long time to write it all out. The whole thing was really infuriating. The guy's lying, outright, and thinks pserv is like Vanilla. 
---
Seems like you spent a lot of time replying to folks with statements along the lines of "this is so wrong", "you don't know" and "you will be surprised". Couldn't you have just taken the time to articulate your rebuttal in the first place?
---
I mean, if you think it's wrong, do the rest of us a favor and say what, specifically, is wrong so that the rest of us can actually carry on the conversation.
---
&gt;Except PvP must be turned on for both sides.
---
In this situation, he can't target the rogue, but the rogue can target him. There would be no difference between this situation and a PvE server with PvP turned on, other than the ganker not being in a low level zone, which seems like the ideal situation for someone who might appreciate PvP, but not the reality of the game: That it is packed full of kids with free time. 
---
&gt;And it’s hard to be childish when that’s exactly what it is. 
---
What made your comment childish is the implication that someone who doesn't want to have their time wasted by people with far more free time is running away and hiding by rolling a PvE server. Children generally have fewer responsibilities and generally do not value their time to the extent an adult would. Your mind immediately went to calling him weak, while an adult with responsibilities would fully understand someone valuing their time more than their desire to make themselves available for ganking.
---
Same price as it would normally, 30 c per stack of items yep.
---
I’ll agree that in the case of internet piracy I made a shitty analogy but if you look in the replies he confirmed that he actually does believe that folks who download songs illegally are criminals and deserve reprisal. Further you’re starting to presume certain things that weren’t said.
---
I definitely didn’t imply the actions weren’t criminal and shouldn’t be considered as such. They run contrary to the law, they are crimes by definition. The argument was whether or not he’s a boot-licker for not understanding why sometimes breaking the law can be a good thing, or at least can be viewed with nuance in respect to its long term benefit, and the cost to its “victims.”
---
Whether or not the things in question are legal is largely inconsequential to his lack of nuance in understanding.
---
for the alliance players out there replace hooves with boar livers.
---
While I don't have any evidence to really counteract your point I think you'll be surprised how many are going to keep to the slightly min/maxed mindset (myself included). Played a fair bit on private servers and can report that the results focused attitude was very present there at least.
---
Like I said the player base might be very different in classic, but I'd be really surprised if people that are selective on what classes to bring, and specs they think are viable suddenly becomes a small minority.
---
Someone called?
---
Before the 10-19 bracket was in the game, when twinking wasn’t a common event, I helped my friends warrior get WW axe at 30. And he got crusader on it. I think the rest of his gear was fairly average, but that axe alone against level 20-30s would destroy. I was playing a shaman with windfury and some boe blue mace and crushing. The brackets were so imbalanced with all the new skills you’d get at 30 it was crazy
---
Especially when I’m more than happy to be one of the +2 needed to summon. Like, as a warlock, you’re not working any harder than the other 2 clickers, just because you’re not the one to cast the spell when you get there. That kind of shit doesn’t have to do with laziness, or being helpful or not. It’s just smarmy and obnoxious, and i don’t want them in my group.
---
Jokes on you i dont even exist
---
Nope. Not morally grey if it benefits me per-say.
---
Morally grey if a convincing argument can be made that it helps more people than it hurts.
---
You are not going to be the next unbreakable and it's not actually like that in reality.
---
You’re the man dude. Love your alliance leveling guide. Just finished it on ndale. Couple of spots are rough but you’re right on the money for most of it. Thanks for all your hard work!
---
I'm considering making a return after 10 years and I think I want to play protection warrior or healer so make it as easy as possible to find groups for 5 mans.
---
I'll never raid so leave that out of the question, Which class/race combination is best as a healer? Primarily for different 5 mans, possibly a bit of 2 man pvp.
---
An owl has 3% less damage but 2% more health. But damage isn't the concern, it's whether or not you'll ever pull aggro off your pet. With a cat, you will. With an owl, you won't.
---
I just nutted. Those fucking marbles man.
---
YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON EXECUTUS!!
---
This is sick, what did you make them on?
---
Trance, mostly tiësto back then, can't wait to listen to them again.
---
One thing that would frequently happen is getting a whisper from some stranger asking "Can you summon me please?" My usual response was "I'll summon you, provided you find the two helpers I'll need and you make the group." That usually shut them up, but sometimes, they would find the helpers nearby me and we'd summon the person.
---
Depends, if the ad gives me a chance to win a PS4 just for filling out some easy, extremely personal information I definitely prefer that! I could win a PS4!
---
i was watching some bfa game play the other day,
---
i came to the conclusion i have no idea whats going on lol
---
I just hope to find a decent guild that is tackling some content.
---
All through my time playing on private servers not once did I join a guild that did more than 5 mans. Mostly this is because private servers are heavily EU based, population wise and I'm PST USA. Trying to find a raid guild with PST raid times is difficult to say the least. I'm so stoked to have an actual west coast server in Classic.
---
You don't have to, but it is an optimal way to play if you have good wands because you get less downtime and comparable or better damage than skills.
---
But you can just use spells and it works fine. Esp. if you don't have really good wands while leveling.
---
Can't have a cave and eat it too.
---
$15 is literally a basic combo meal at many fast food places
---
$15 is the cost of two of those Funko pop abominations
---
$15 is a few pints of beer or a 6 pack of specialty alcohol
---
$15 is a great value for what will realistically be 12-18 hours of ingame time
---
I dumped Thottbot pretty early for Alakazam and used that until Wowhead came out. I was never big on Thottbot.
---
90% of the sub wouldn't exist
---
Who do you know who doesn't take a calculator to a test that allows calculators? Among those people, who actually does as well as they would if they had a calculator? And does the person who brings a calculator have to do ten times as much work to be prepared as the person who doesn't?
---
Nah man.
---
Damn I forgot about allakhazam, I used that site all the time for Everquest back in the day.
---
I did but only because I had been a Star Wars Galaxies player and knew what SOE was doing to EQ right alongside my own game.
---
Last stress test we were doing the highest level quests we could to get imba gear for our level. Warsong Gulch was possible so people wanted to "twink". Only problem was we shared BG queue with the beta players...
---
It is not "your group". It is you and you alone. God complex confirmed.
---
I've always agreed he is a rogue I wow, but it's nice to have a pet named Gwen too.
---
Isn't an exploit just a shit mechanic that gets abused to a certain point?
---
but then you are stuck with 27 days of BFA sub
---
Nah, if you have AQ40, rank14 gear or naxx gear you're going to wreck a fresh 60 the same way a trink will wreck a leveler.
---
When setting up stat weighting can you add the ability to set breakpoints like hit cap, etc?
---
Ya, I can't watch this crap.
---
I'll get to level 17, get a few dungeon blues, then level purely through BGs. I did that on my mage and became monstrously good at maging.
---
Everyone in the EU..
---
Yea, I'll be crazy excited of they do a TBC server. I love that all the specs became a lot more viable.
---
Wtf? Can someone explain why they exclude all Europeans?
---
They got Majin-Buu'd by the all powerful WoWHead just like my boy Thottbot.
---
I’ll just use bear to avoid this choice
---
Asshole DPS: "LOL GoOd TaNk DoEsN't NeEd 2 SeCoNdS!!!" 
---
No.... Maybe not, but do realize the amount of headache you're saving everyone by chilling out for 2 seconds?
---
Considering that pre-bis is crossbow from LBRS or strat (depending of patch) then the AV crossbow. Of course if you are retarded, you can craft for 1000g the arcanite rifle which does less dps and has less optimal attack speed.
---
The only gun you could use is from AQ Ouro so your point is irrevelant, you are raiding with 9 less agility you are not a great hunter :).
---
Does active mean has gametime on that day or is set up to be charged for the next month? Because I prefer to buy game time month-to-month, so my sub isn't marked active but I still have game time.
---
It's funny that you think you'll be able to hop layers as you please. 
---
1. There has to be a 2nd layer 
---
2. You have to find someone on that layer(friend guildies etc are prio to your layer) 
---
3. Re logging might not even move you( think of being layer locked like a raid lockout with only having other raid invite overriding that lock. Aka you don't ever get out of your layer unless invited out.
---
HAHA no. One of my favourite is wheb ppl soam "hehe xd tryhards content ez we can do it with retadinns too stfu hehe" but then reality check comes when their healers run out of mana and the boss is still at 40%
---
And they have a new release of project 1999 coming out in October. The old 2010 server still has upwards of 2k people playing on it.
---
It was pretty easy to get someone to invite you to the right layer. Then you can just drop from their raid, form your own raid, and invite others who want to be on the layer as well. Rinse and repeat until the servers die.
---
Are we talking about Vanilla or BFA here? /s
---
No fucking way it will be 100k that’s so low. I’d say at least a million after the first couple months.
---
The main reason I stopped tanking in BFA is because every time I'd do an LOS pull the DPS would pull aggro and then I had to run all around the map trying to gather the mobs up.
---
Cries in EU
---
You can play D&amp;D without embracing a character history and making decisions in character. You can also play WoW or other computer RPGs without embracing a character history or making decisions in character. Just because *you* don't roleplay doesn't make the game any less of an RPG. 
---
And yes, I'd consider modern Call of Duties to have some RPG elements. Most modern games do.
---
LOL i mean yeah... people tend to have no clue what's best for themselves it's a pretty common phenomenon
---
Yeah probably but now it's too late, someone else can do it perhaps
---
That also never happened.
---
Who cares?
---
You're right, that would be nice if I wanted to take the time. I almost would, and hoped someone did. But I'd have watch the thing again. And then respond to every point. There weren't only a couple of things that were unfactual, or illogical. 
---
It's just not worth the time, and not many people would read it anyways. If I thought a decent amount of people would see it, I totally would.
---
Except, I’m an adult. I have a job, house, girlfriend etc.
---
It’s an outlook thing. I think getting ganked is part of the game. He doesn’t. That’s fine. But I’m painting a picture here to show where I’m coming from. You’re awfully sensitive about something that didn’t even involve you btw. 
---
To me, and that’s what this is - my opinion - not stating he’s objectively wrong - but let’s remember here that I was responding to OP originally who seems to have a very different attitude toward PvP/pve realms. 
---
To me - you are missing out on the war portion of warcrAft by rolling pve.   I’m totally within my right to express that opinion.  Just as he is able to express his. 
---
Why YOU personally took offense to this I don’t know but acting like I’m childish for having a different outlook on this is stupid. 
---
Play on your pve server lol. I don’t care.  Whatever makes you happy - I was responding to OP originally.  Seems like you’re defending someone who doesn’t need defending and I’m not sure why.
---
It’s kinda weird.... On the one hand, TBC class overhaul, dungeon design and raid content were a radical improvement  over Vanilla. On the other hand, I just never dug the whole fantasy sci-fi thing, and the quality of lore took a massive nosedive.
---
It will naturally thin out when you get into the 20's and 30's (more so in the 30's). There is no way people will stick it out so long that high level zones will be flooded.
---
I didn’t mean to imply that bringing an unpopular spec is a fuckup. I just mean that having an emergency offtank/offhealer is only valuable when someone else has fucked up.
---
Not even close. They jumped on the train when it was already rolling.
---
This is why I think I'm just gonna roll smite spec.
---
nothing says Wow jumped the shark like "Me gonna ook you in the dooker!"
---
Warrior - the worst to level solo. My cousins and uncle are going to be playing when Classic comes out so hopefully I’ll never have to be alone
---
Maybe you should just ignore the thread next time instead of posting your worthless unappreciated opinion.
---
If a mechanic being trash is not reason for removal, then what possible reason is there for anything to be removed, ever?
---
Blizzard has always given the reason "not working as intended". Do you think that they really intended for players to wait around on alts until someone turns in a quest so they can send out alerts for the whole guild to log on for the buff, then have those same players log out until time to raid? No video game developer would ever intentionally design a system that incentivizes logging out over playing the game.
---
Well I had to transfer in BC, not Vanilla, but I remember really regretting it.
---
However, with that said, it is still **way better** to play with friends than to not play with friends. So I would roll PvE with friends after a vote.
---
One day we'll have some sort of testing for people without subs... one day
---
If someone who is going to play Ret Paladin doesn't make this their name, it'll be a shame...
---
No Alts bruh
---
That did happen but, I have to wait for after work to link it.
---
Same experience man!  Except mine was a wind serpent named Sting.  &amp; instead of leveling properly I would do things like explore Tanaris as a lvl 19 and die every 14 seconds.
---
Because people value selfish stuff instead of doing something actually useful for their enviroment
---
I would like to get at least level 10 before starting
---
Doesn't molten-mc deserver just as much credit here?
---
New Classic Races
---
There will always be a demand from some players for more races/classes etc.. The classes Blizzard introduced in the expansions don't belong in Classic WoW. From a gameplay and lore perspective. However, Worgen and Goblin were prominent in Classic WoW, and adding these two races and their zones would fit in perfectly

&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 8pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.
---
1/2 best answers to far.
---
Mage - that moment when you’re level 60, but you can only make level 45 water, and the Dire Maul patch isn’t out yet. But you’d be a fool to buy level 55 water as a mage. So you spend 90 seconds refilling your mana every time you go OOM. You may as well be literally sitting dungeons out, since 10 frostbolts layer, you have to spend a good 30 seconds drinking.
---
yeah. i see you have an .eu domain. it's only for oceanic and us players, at least everyone with an active sub gets it now. the servers are gonna be insanely stressed out. i thought they'd save that for the last test in july
---
what happened to autoreply -&gt; email?   We had that 25 years ago, you set it up when you take your holiday and you shut it down when you come back, 2 minutes work to write a polite reply with info when you will be back and (if needed) which co-worker they should contact for extremely urgent business.
---
"Why did I pay $15 to support BFA? BFA is a horrible game and should be banned by the ESRB and PEGI."
---
&gt;If a mechanic being trash is not reason for removal, then what possible reason is there for anything to be removed, ever?
---
The whole point of classic is to release it in the state it was in vanilla, good and bad parts included.
---
You want LFR?  What in the actual fuck?
---
If you look at the most competitive battlegroups, like EU-Cyclone, it was all humans. Some people probably didn't want to farm 2 PvE trinkets or pay to change to human. On the official Arena Tournament Realms, you can bet that basically everyone was Human.
---
Now go show the world record holder who's boss.
---
Can you rephrase that, but this time in readable english so that I can reply?
---
I mean it’s better than trusting the devs entirely and it’s a good avenue to provide feedback. I don’t see OSRS massively regretting any updates and there it’s very difficult for Jagex to pass massive updates like new skills. It’s a flawed system sure but it’s the best that exists so far that maintains a respect of the original design philosophy and healthy updates to the game. Mind you, I’m open to a better system. Jagex’s however is the most successful in the industry.
---
As for oppressive content, Naxx40 is probably the worst offender. But I agree with you on that. New content should expand ways to play and power creep is to be avoided.
---
50k.... really? So you think the entire classic wow population is going to be less than what a private server had. You realize nos had around 100k registered accounts.
---
I’ve witnessed many good Pally tanks that have been pure perfection. But I treat it like their shaman counterpart. If you’re tanking as a shammy or Pally, you probably know what you’re doing, whereas a warrior tank, more often that not, doesn’t have a clue and is just tanking to get a group. 
---
And yeah, a group that doesn’t suck helps, plus it’s unfortunate you have to sacrifice your other blessings for Salv.
---
Was he an elite back then? At least there is a potential for loot, stitches was just op with shit loot.
---
Do you think that they really intended for players to wait around on alts until someone turns in a quest, so that they can send out alerts for the whole guild to log on for the buff, then have those same players log out and stop playing their mains until time to raid? 
---
No video game developer would ever intentionally design a system that incentivizes logging out over playing the game.
---
Not knowing whether TBC servers are ever going to happen so that I can roll a druid without worrying about being forced to heal.
---
....or was that plan all along..hmmmmm
---
Phew. I was afraid that i had to farm properly without the safety of using pathing !
---
It’s a joke, sport,
---
this is glorious
---
Having wowhead running makes my pc lag more than running wow for example, it is indeed pretty terrible
---
Honestly, I dont think I'd be able to play without world pvp, it brings such sm exciting element back to the game
---
Its not like they built the emulator or DB from scratch themselves tbh. They just modified stuff like viewdistance so that the mangos emulator could cater more people. Of course, they also fixed bugs by themselves and by taking from the public repo without giving anything back.
---
The bigger work was researching the progressive itemization and even with that we talk about a few months of hardish labor for 2 people, less with more people.
---
Considering the amount of players they had, they probably got enough in donations to feel good and easy about it, even after server costs.
---
Best era you mean? WoW came out between my year break from HS to College and my best gaming buddy just got back from his deployment in Iraq so he was doing nothing for a year afterwards just so he could "unwind".
---
I know it wasn't objectively the best use of our time but I regret nothing in our mountain dew and Cheeto filled year of gaming ecstasy.
---
I played UO since release so I always had some unreasonable dislike of EQ players.
---
Seeing as its impossible to predict the outcome of launch with there being so many variables, adapting to the situation is going to be your best bet.
---
I would start by making test characters on a private server (beta if you have it) and timing your 1-6, 6-12 lvling process.
---
Test different routes like skipping quests and grinding mobs instead. 
---
If you do this enough come launch you can have different plans for different circumstance!
---
Zam Network bought Thottbot in 2007 for $1m, then merged it with Wowhead in 2010.
---
This is the visage of every rogue in every group.
---
Apples and oranges.  A company doesn't need to give anyone credit for something that wasn't authorized to begin with.  Thanks for playing.
---
thats a very goon way to make a bad name on your server and be on lot of ignore lists. Good luck find groups and guilds in pve after that.
---
This can be said for dps classes like mage and lock as well.
---
Raiding in vanilla (as far as rotations goes) is just downright boring. Mage rotation: frostbolt. Warlock rotation: Shadowbolt.
---
Same goes for healing, but I at least find healing more fun because it feels like I'm actually doing something of significance. It's much easier to get lost among the crowd of dpsers.
---
Fun is subjective, people like me enjoy progressing our character and competing with other people with similar mindsets. I mean MC is piss easy, privates had pug raids clearing everything up to AQ40 (last 2 bosses could be iffy here) so this is not a requirement whatsoever.
---
*vomiting smiley*

Those should go to Cyberpunk 2077

Double enter for new line items on reddit.

---
Yeah and they should add artifacts! And pet battles! And azerite!
---
Nobody is asking for this shit dude, stop making up issues that don't exist.
---
well ret is better than enhancement and feral/resto druid is stronger on ally, so I'd say ally.
---
Cries in eu-server !
---
Thanks a whole bunch for your detailed responses. I was unaware One Handed Weapon Specialization also improves SoR damage. Has this been tested on the beta? Are we sure it's not just private server functionality?
---
I'll probably go Dwarf as well for the same reasons. I'm not planning on tanking in raids at all, just 5-mans to get niche gear, gold, quests, and to help friends.
---
See you in classic
---
I will miss transmog and the huge number of mounts!
---
some people would change their character into another creature/beast. this would allow them access to areas players can't normally access. (e.g. it used to be popular in AB, a certain model would let you escape the buffing area, and you could start the match with one flag nearly capped.)
---
Blizard lets it slide for awhile then when it gets out of hand they hand out the bans and suspensions. If your using it to your obvious advantage, you'll get reported and action will be taken sooner.
---
PS players shit talk current wow players non stop then act surprised when some shit gets thrown thier way
---
Did they break that ceiling? Game isn't even out yet. Realistically speaking the whole 'you think you do' idea will probably apply to a lot of people and you'll see a steep population drop after a month or so.. not many people will be able to stick with a 15 year old game once they get their share of nostalgia.
---
That was only a horde advantage when they decided to put tickets in AV to speed it up.  Blizzard cant have horde on an even playing field though so change horde spawn location which gave the advantage back to alliance
---
Tomorrow it will be 69 days.....Niceeeeeeeee
---
What about a feral tank druid?  Is that also better on alliance?
---
Yeah! And showing them "Hey! We want your product!"
---
They'll never know what hit them.
---
The tanks whole job is to take aggro. The dps is making the job unnecessarily difficult when they pull mobs without consent of the party. Let the dps die and they won’t do it again. The tank/ healer is well within right to allow this.
---
Actually not, its just an Info for u all :)
---
Really it just comes down to math.  If a bard provides a song that gives all party members 200% damage (but it doesn’t stack) then you probably want one bars to succeed.  If you design encounters that require your rogues to do double damage then you better have both right?  You can have games designed around support, but their buffs have to be significant and designed around.
---
Shadow priests in TBC were a good example of a support class doing some good work.  Slightly lower DPS but the mana they provided (which scaled) was necessary.
---
Wait does the flute work outside of the tram?
---
Mileage  = ping 
---
See [500-mile email](https://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html)
---
Sure why not
---
Both shit the bed after a certain period, so a restart was desired by the community?
---
Pretty sure that's easy to compare.
---
From his website:
---
&gt; I personally use a cat as my main pet mainly because it does the most DPS out of all pets.
---
Yeah, that's some hardcore min/maxing theorycrafting right there. /s
---
I definitely agree that alliance is better for druids in general, but I don't think fear ward plays a big role in that honestly. Put a shaman in the druid tanks group, drop a tremor totem and you're good to go.
---
I remember level 59 twinking my warlock with pure stamina greens from Outland. Triple everyone else’s HP. Could dot 5+ people and just run around with the flag.
---
I loved playing a rogue and picking off AFKs in those spots, free solo hk a lot of the time
---
Same keyboard 👍
---
&gt; wait for 3 sunders
---
*laughs in hunter*
---
I hadn’t thought of this, I naturally assumed that the server would control the size. Fair enough, personally I wasn’t too fussed but seeing how much negative press this is getting I’ll just stay well clear. Cheers.

I love how you describe your past self. I see you’re a man if -culture- self-loathing as well. Thanks for the story! 
---
I myself have resolved to not waste two weeks trying to fight through BFD solo before realizing that you need multiple people.
---
The problem is deeper than you realize though. It’s deeper than *I* realize, because my idea classic has small changes here and there. 
---
But say you wanted to make ret raid dps more competitive... suddenly they’re unstoppable wrecking machines in plate that have bubble and heals, and then also have the option for 2 other specs. 
---
More mana regen for spriests and boomkins would be great for raids, but again, they would be unstoppable PvP machines. Spriests would be *even better* levelers, when they’re already excellent.
---
It’s not about being a purist. It’s understanding that there *is* thought put into class design, by nerdy designers that wanted to play the game they made. Instead of tweaks done by people who simply recreate the game. For the most part it sounds like people just want TBC classes with the Vanilla world. They were necessary changes to make everyone more viable, but it would be awful to have Classic resemble that stage of the game.
---
I’m not even against “changes” if they decide to release a Classic+ server and keep old Classic seperate. But when we’re just getting Classic, I’d rather have a version that isn’t bastardized, *solely for the sake of raid dps numbers*.
---
My man +1
---
Dear Blizzard,
---
Put these on the weekends.
---
Sincerely,
---
Everyone with a day job.
---
Yeah I never enjoyed pubstomping too much- always felt bad after a few minutes- but it did feel good taking on the other team’s twinks to give your own un-twinked folk a fighting chance. 
---
And yeah, I had a twink WAY before I got to 60. Can’t even imagine how long it would take to try and get BIS at max level
---
It's my group if I make it and if you're lucky enough to get an invite you behave or you're no longer welcome. Simple as that really chum.
---
I’d say the anti-private server circle jerk is partially due to the elitist attitude that comes from some (obviously not all) private server players.  Regardless of how knowledgeable you are, the “I’m smarter than you so stfu” attitude isn’t exactly a crowd pleaser.
---
Dont Tell me you want to wear that to your wedding
---
50 cents a day! Not bad, am I right?
---
The Prodigy, early albums
---
Quick, reroll before it's too late.
---
Cannot praise you enough for this website. This is what a BiS website needs to be.
---
Considering i have a second account and will have 2 clients open at all times pretty fast.
---
awesome do you also heal? :)
---
So King Bang won't be able to run down epic mounts with his dash? lol =(
---
You and me both bro. I'll be taking it slow, but you know you'll want those sweet purples once you hit 60!
---
No crusader strike or taunt in classic.
---
I do think people deserve to be paid for their work, yes. Running a private server isn't like just flipping a switch and turning it on, there's an assload of development work they put into it.
---
you'll find raids easily as a healer. as a druid, you'll be casting innervate on casters for the most part and off healing the raid. if a group gets in a 5man with only a druid they're gonna be bummed out. the lack of a res is disappointing.
---
&gt;Except here, you gain weight.
---
Not if you’re always too busy grinding to raid the fridge!
---
I'm going to be a level 60 twink. And when I own people they will blame my gear.
---
It won't be the faction that matters it will be your guild/friends. You'll find an equal amount on both.
---
I wouldnt say feral tanks are meme specs.  They are excellent off tanks and have higher threat generation early on.  They can't MT everything but bringing one is a good idea.  They can off heal as well.
---
I liked it more when zandalari were seen as that tribe that saw itself above the two factions, I'd rather they made that jungle tribe that's already in the horde playable
---
I wonder how many extra subs Blizzard will get doing this, enticing people to have a subscription prior to late August.
---
With a VM rendering the ebook in brave browser
---
Make sure to order the screws on amazon. 5 day shipping.
---
"It said prime! I swear this project is messing with me!"
---
I was gonna write exactly this.
---
I would convince them that if they come to your server choice, you will play a support class that is needed.  Whether that is priest, warlock or a tank warrior. also, if your friends level together having 2 players is more likely to win unfair pvp battles than if they played alone.
---
I'm so glad I hated Lord of the Rings and loved metal music when I was 12.
---
I made an Undead warrior, so proud of my younger self.
---
100% She bought the cuff links for me.
---
It kinda depends honestly, feral tanks are technically "stronger" on ally, but because of their ability to do outragerous threat, they might actually be more needed on horde.
---
Why do you think experiencing a face to face communication with blizzard alone worth anything? Are they celestial being? They are lower than any successful game developer. Blizzard was nosediving, nostalrius saved them.
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
---
I mean, did you read that post? It says "There are a number of
---
destinations within that radius that we can't reach, either" It's not about the mileage, it's about the ping. It just so happens that ping and mileage are weakly related due to how cabling works. But to say that a person is "x miles = y ping" is wrong. Use a VPN and you'll see what I mean. You could be right next to the server, but because of how it is routed you could have a very high ping.
---
lol don't wear those at your actual wedding. the text is fine since that's inside your vest and it's a cool thing for you
---
Personally i only tried it once and used to to replace all gnomes with the succubus and the succubus model with a gnome, made the world more believable.
---
That's not what he's asking tho?
---
How do they manage to not level up while grinding that gear though?
---
"Sorry man, you're 35th in line for agi leather..."
---
The mental gymnastics i go through to make it not feel like an eternity is mind boggling.
---
Who was laughing at EQ players? Many people who played beta and vanilla came from EQ/swg.
---
Why would feral/balance be stronger on Alliance? It’s literally the same class and spec that Horde gets.
---
I can’t believe how seriously you took my comment.  -50dkp for you.
---
&gt;It isn’t stealing, it’s copying.
---
Which is also known as intellectual property crime.
---
&gt;Blizzard wasn’t using the IP so they weren’t even taking potential customers.
---
Doesn't matter. It's their property and they decide how to use it.
---
&gt;Also, most people playing the game bought a copy of vanilla back in the day. They’re just using something they already paid for. 
---
No, what they bought is the property that Blizzard maintains. Nowhere in the agreement does it say that people are allowed to host or play on private servers.
---
&gt;There is absolutely nothing wrong or immoral about it. Laws don’t dictate morality.
---
And just because laws don't dictate morality that doesn't mean this isn't wrong and immoral. People worked to make a product and others copy it and earn money from it. If you think that isn't immoral then your moral compass is broken.
---
They also only made their server using the core code created by others.  Nostalrius would not have existed without all the work before making vanilla WoW private servers possible.   
---
What the Nost. team did was figure out how to make a high population server that didn't lag and was stable with so many people on it.  Plus they offered a reliable server without the drama so many private servers have.
---
Ha, now I wish I had seen that.
---
Horde players have a 100% divorce rate. Just saying, probably better to reroll while you can
---
You're not my buddy, guy.
---
Druid seems like its going to be underrepresented because they do a little of everything but nothing as well as any other class. So there is definitely going to be room for competent druids in raids as healers. 
---
The lack of rez options as Druid for dungeons will suck but the fact that you’ll have a lot of people pursuing engineering might help toward the end game dungeons. People will have to learn what it’s like to run back. 
---
There is certainly going to be an oversaturation of warriors initially so it might be more competitive for raid slots. 
---
Priest seems like a good middle ground. If you don’t mind healing and you’re half way decent you’ll find a spot in raids and either holy or shadow has viability in PVP.
---
Stress test the hell out of it bros!
---
Source for this?  That they wanted Blizzard to make Classic when they started Nostalrius?
---
I can agree with you on that, watching other people play it gives a false sense of experience that's not really comparable to playing the game yourself. It deflates the hype a little bit for me aswell. It's better to stop watching streams all together in this case, stop obsessing over the beta as it is in more than one sense not the game it's gonna be.
---
Blizzard wasn't selling it. I could have walked up to their office with a wad of cash in hand asking to play classic and they would turn me away. You'll excuse me if I don't feel bad for Blizzard when somebody else offers the service they refuse to.
---
Fuckin wear them at your wedding! Don’t listen to these silly boys.
---
I got the joke.... it's the onion after all.
---
Enjoy your wedding. Glad you found someone that enjoys the nerd side of you as much as you do.
---
On the flip side have you seen the old pvp videos of rogues completely naked with a gray dagger taking down people in T2 gear just by utilizing their skillset? At 60 you have more tools to compensate for a lack of gear that you just don't have at lower levels.
---
I'm saying that the logic in your calculator comparison is flawed. The calculator is an advantage that this hypothetical test-taker is declining to take, so I see where you started on this, but that's where the similarities end. 
---
A person who takes a calculator is gaining an advantage, but the scale of that advantage depends on the difficulty of the math test. If we're talking arithmatic, the advantage is trivial, but if we're talking differential equations with a time limit, it might be impossible without a calculator. Contrast that to a person who takes all world buffs. The advantage is always huge and it scales up with gear. 
---
Furthermore, a person who passes on taking a calculator is not saving time or effort. However, a person who passes on getting all world buffs is saving a substantial amount of time and effort, while being free to play whichever character he wants without worrying about losing buffs.
---
&gt; Epic flying mounts were hard to achieve
---
Fuck flying.
---
i liked bears. easy to find food and very tanky. dps not as a good as a cat but i used cats in dungeons. i like how hunters could find and tame exotic pets, like that one in thousand needles(?) that had a 1.0 attack speed which was a nightmare for casters. i logged onto my hunter the other day (the first char to hit 60 in vanilla) and his gear was terrible, but he did have a helm of narv equipped, the first epic i ever found
---
something highly ridiculous like a trip to moon on a tesla
---
Started Warcraft 3 the other day for another playthroufhplay through. Unbelievable how well it has aged, it's still a phenomenal game for its age. It's such a good game at its core that the reforged news still seems odd to me.
---
Link that cast please, and give us a time if you have it, because I don't believe any of them are working for Blizzard.
---
He made over 8 million dollars selling his guide lmao. I think you are a bit jealous of his success.
---
It wasn't sanctioned by the property owner... so no, they do not deserve to be paid for their work.
---
not a surprise :(
---
*How* though? 
---
Alliance druids don’t get anymore abilities or spells that Horde druids don’t get.
---
Not really quite like that, because literally anyone can do it. It takes time to get some of the best pieces, but those aren't even like expensive boe items. 
---
Isn't outgearing people via 40 man raids at level 60 the same thing? If anything, the low level BGs are *more* fair because literally anyone can do it. And do it solo (aside from DM items, which are easy to pug).
---
You keep investing more time in this thread while never getting any closer to explicitly stating your point.
---
I'd say a shit mechanic is more like when two fully intended systems have unintended interactions. For example, world buffs are a fun mechanic that engages all of the server with the raiders, their insane level of strength is fun and they don't really unbalance leveling since you only have them for 2 hours. Now however take world buffs and scale them over 40 players going up against content that wasn't balanced with world buffs in mind: unintended interaction leading to bad gameplay.
---
Exploit is more of a game behavior that was clearly unintended, for example the various places that flag runners can hide in WSG.
---
Where did you get your item data for the things you aren’t linking out to wowhead? Is there a repo somewhere you used?
---
Oh yeah daddy pull it all
---
Flying in TBC was completely limited to Outland. There were no auction houses in Outland so people still spent tons of time on the ground. 
---
That and you couldn't get flying mounts untill like level 68 so you had to spend the majority of your leveling on the ground. 
---
I think it was perfectly implemented in TBC.
---
Nobodys arguing for that. Its just that some individuals took a risk that now enables your playing in august, yet you dont want to recognize their achievement.
---
always left out :( :cries:
---
they benefit from pallies more than druids on horde do from shamans (windfury) because of their high attack speed
---
\&gt; Joana is already having one made ~~for release~~ :)
---
FTFY
---
They didn't need them. They just put much more experienced and skilled coders on the team for Classic.   
---
There was never any mention by Blizzard that they would hire anyone from Nostalrius.
---
Thousands will already have a lvl 10 from last test.
---
Is that 3pm pacific?
---
There may not be something with that exact of wording but you could deduce based on the fact that they met with blizzard on how they got it to work could show that it’s what they would’ve liked long term. I mean the whole private server was simply created because they wanted to play Vanilla and provide a place for other people to play it in order to support a community that obviously existed.
---
They just go in your sticker book, you don't have to store them in bags.
---
/mountrandom
---
There's also a command that's something like that so you can just get on a random mount when you want to mount up.
---
They got to help blizzard make classic.  I think that’s a really good reward.
---
Paladin buffs vs shaman totems.
---
Yeah, n miles = minimally x ping
---
&gt; Doesn't mean it's not fun to reminisce about that period of "WoW history".   
---
&gt; I understood it was a joke, I still felt the need disagree with a comedian  
---
&gt;Signed, Prolapsecancer
---
"yes, yes, wrong, yes"
---
They might not have initially but they definitely turned into the martyr group to promote an official vanilla realm
---
Basically this. The only thing nost did was to use what had come before and put it in one place and make it actually work consistently.
---
Bit like facebook actually.
---
I will play a sad song on the world's smallest violin (EU here)
---
Former Glad. Former Twink Guild leader. Your opinion doesn't really matter to me though.
---
Maybe I will later, just to prove a point. That was my initial reaction, to do so. Maybe you've convinced me.
---
August 26, 3pm PST is the US release date
---
Would love to try it out, sadly having issues signing up to use it. Verification  email  has not sent.
---
&gt;Someone in some lvl 50+ rares can still compete vs someone in rank 14 gear.
---
well yes, but actually no
---
Idk :/
---
Well, they managed to have much better servers and players density than Blizz and make servers playable without sharding 4 years ago.
---
Feels
---
But you cant play classic on ps4
---
Tremor totem pulses every 4seconds. Enough for a dragon to breath the raid. With a godly shaman it's possible, but 1 poor totem timing could spell a wipe.
---
I felt like frost got a LOT better in wrath with deep freeze (I think deep freeze did damage in addition to the stun at first?).  Fire peaked in classic for sure, IDK if it ever got better since i quit after wrath.
---
I’d argue Paladin Blessings aren’t any better than Shaman totems.
---
backpedaling is actually a huge advantage in pvp against melee classes. They can never get behind you if you just back pedal and itll make them rage hard.
---
S is reserved for back pedaling and will always be so on my keyboard.
---
This guy is a troll account. He posts bullshit posts constantly. Block him and report him.
---
You sell yourself short on a complete WoW experience if you don't play a PvP server. Just an opinion of someone who's played the game for 10+ years.
---
Yeah gonna make an alt early and drop them in the inn
---
Are they actually serious? No stress test for EU? And it also lasts 48 hours, has level 15 cap so tons of fun stuff to try.
---
What the actual fuck.
---
because google cant find words written in the description of an addon /s
---
NP glad to hear you got use out of it!
---
The fact that they did a number squish and the numbers are still way too big is depressing.
---
Unfortunately never found myself a 3s group for this set up, I liked to arena with my buddies who played shadow priest and ret paladin.  We would get creamed as you would expect.
---
Because according to the classic cast with guest nano, this discussion they had was about how they did it, because blizzard wanted to release classic. They asked the nost team question on how they balanced the game around guessing values and things. A lot of the strategies that nost used to simulate the data was used by blizzard in the development of classic.
---
Classic wow isn’t on 1.12.1 it is a modernized client patched to 1.12.1 which means the means to the end is different compared to servers, nost helped them with this.
---
Ya you lost a bet
---
rolfcopter
---
Paladin: I level too slow
---
Warrior: I do too
---
I hate to rain on your parade, but WoW-Pro already does this, their addon is based on the old TourGuide so it supports the same guide format and it is working in Classic beta.
---
[http://www.wow-pro.com/](http://www.wow-pro.com/)
---
Proved all the naysayers sorry asses wrong. One by one. Wall of no inbred spammers, Blizzard, and Forum CMs who used to delete our threads within seconds.
---
I was replying to a just as ridicules comparison that fails the exact same way as mine does. The goal was not to make a proper comparison to world buffing, but to ridicule the comparison that the guy I replied to wrote.
---
You could do this in any expansion (til cata) though right?  I dont remember when they removed downranking
---
I don’t think it makes nearly enough of a difference to turn Balance into anything remotely resembling raid-playable, and the difference it adds to Feral is negligible.
---
Congratulations! Here is hoping we wont be looking for Hypezlol99's wife in the Barrens ;)
---
I absolutely agree, though I'd prefer to not change the base game but continue from Vanilla with these kinds of improvements. You could simply put 'Righteous Fury now increases threat from Holy damage by 200%' to a 2-set piece for T4 or whatever. It's not like there isn't wonky stuff already in those tiers, like T2 Paladin being useless for healers. This way you wouldn't force these changes through class changes, but through itemization which feels far more 'vanilla' to me.
---
Paladin, simply because they're alliance only. Zug zug.
---
I always admired those guys because EQ is a very difficult game compared to WoW.
---
I've been conflicted about Wrath for a long time.  On one hand, I felt (and still feel) like it was pure, shallow, hyper-casual garbage.  On the other hand, it's _worlds_ better than what followed it.
---
That and the change to healers for Cata that made them mostly identical. Nourish for druids was the lamest thing everyone create the vision of all healers having;
---
1. Fast, expensive, high health 
---
2. Slow, less expensive, high health
---
3. Slow, cheap, low health
---
no, when I can just ambush you for 180% of your max health.
---
I think the concern is the retail mentality bleeding into classic.  Inevitably someone's going to assume the differences are overblown and try to play classic dungeons like it's BfA.
---
Apples and oranges are both fruits. They are not the same fruit. But you could say they both grow on trees. And if you water the tree it would be more healthier than if you didn’t water it.
---
No.  They made a private server because they wanted to play on it.  It was never because they thought they could push Blizzard into making Classic servers.        
---
&gt;you could deduce based on the fact that they met with blizzard on how they got it to work could show that it’s what they would’ve liked long term.      
---
This has nothing to do with the claim I replied to:   
---
&gt;WoW Classic, the very thing they set out to make to begin with   
---
They never set out to get Blizzard to release official servers. They just set out to make a good private server.  They had no idea they would ever meet with Blizzard or have any impact on Classic servers coming.  They just did a really good job and made a big private server, that Blizzard noticed. And then they got publicity when Blizzard shut them down.
---
Based on what?
---
Theorycrafters has already solved this and ally is stronger, what's your merit to thinking that this known thing is wrong?
---
You’re mad the game didn’t cater to end game guilds that have max level characters with blue/purples 2 weeks after launch? Sounds like WoW isn’t your game my friend. Plenty to do with the expansion other than raid the intentionally casual  end game raids, that had hard mode achievements possible to keep you busy. 
---
Level alts, level professions, farm gold, explore the whole new continent, PvP. All of these things being so easy to begin but hard to master/finish make Wrath the best expansion WoW has ever had, which is a pretty agreed upon concept outside of the Classic circlejerk.
---
Absolutely a shame you didn’t stick around for Ulduar and ICC, the best and hardest raids to be released at their respective times. I’m sure you would’ve enjoyed them.
---
&gt;The classic client has the exact same addon capabilities as retail, it's definitely possible to make an addon like that.
---
This isn't exactly true. They said they are going to have a modified API for classic so prevent addons that go against the spirit of the classic game. But this is an add on that I'm sure will be possible.
---
shaman vs paladin
---
It's weird you're being a dick to this person being that there's almost 10 recorded videos of people easily maneuvering through layers. The person you're responding to is being more rational than you are with everything we've learned from the beta thus far.
---
Not with that attitude
---
I disagree.
---
Esfand asked the dev panel of classic wow at the last blizzcon if anyone associated with Nostalrius were working on Classic, to which they replied no.
---
Will our characters from the previous stress test be available?
---
&gt;The whole point of classic is to release it in the state it was in vanilla, good and bad parts included.
---
Is this what Blizzard claims? It sounds like the objective of #nochanges, but I don't think that that movement can define the "point" of classic.
---
&gt;If you want to accurately recreate something you dont remove the parts you dont like.
---
Again, who defines "accurately"? The game, even in vanilla, existed in many forms. You can't get every version. What is best for the game is not dictated by some rigid definition "accurate" in the minds of long-time players. To me, the "point" of classic is a return to a living, socially engaging world where my actions have consequence and my work feels valuable. Planning when I log in or log out around world buffs is not checking any of those boxes. It's min-maxing without any of the mechanical flavor.
---
im a mage, not a magician
---
Agreed 100%. They are doing this with WC3. Just give us 1.13
---
No... that’s not what a catalyst is at all. 
---
cat·a·lyst
---
/ˈkad(ə)ləst/
---
noun
---
a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change.
---
A catalyst increases the *rate* of a reaction. In this context, the call for classic was always simmering in Blizz’s point of view, but Nost greatly accelerated the push for Classic.
---
They started Nost because they weren’t satisfied with the direction WoW was taking just like all those playing on it, including their successors. Blizz taking the Jagex approach to vanilla servers was a narrow pipe dream at that time. When Blizz sent them a C&amp;D, they were shutting down the biggest private server in history at that time. 
---
A couple of the server owners were ex blizz employees, so they sat down with Blizzard in attempt to negotiate Classic.
---
What is wrong with my name?
---
&gt; This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account in the Americas &amp; Oceania region.
---
You won't have access unless you spend another $15.
---
thats any class
---
No EU at all
---
that's still a thing for sure and everyone uses it.  however, I've worked at 2 fortune 500 companies in the last 5 years and most people seem to work/respond at some level over vacations.  It's sad times but most big companies resources are so squeezed (low headcount at corporate, lean &amp; efficient teams) that one person being out is hard for a lot of people.                      
---
Personally I've set the expectations with my bosses right away that it's not something I do and I won't be available.  I think it happens mostly to people who are pushovers / they want to impress their boss / they dont want to get behind / something really important actually comes up / they dont want to put the "extra" work on their team members shoulders
---
Seems like their problem. Priests need to farm as well.
---
A lack of a res is a big deal in dungeons. You can heal still, but its harder. Druids usually tank 5-man content because of the lack of res. They're usually the last healers picked for 5-man content.
---
If you want versatility in your solo gameplay, go for Druid. If you want to be a better healer, you play Priest. If you just want to do content it doesn't matter, raids want Priests and Druids. 
---
Priests have a stronger demand, but Druids are far fewer in supply. They can be hard to recruit for completely different reasons.
---
I didn't realize they were the first people to emulate a wow server.  I was under the impression that people have been doing that since Vanilla was endgame.  I also didn't realize that they were the first people to come up with the idea of playing an old game again... that's such a foreign concept.
---
Are you separating your decimals with a . or a ,? It could be a standards thing.
---
The horror
---
Do you have a rough idea of # of raid nights and times yet? I'm planning on playing as a holy/disc priest.
---
The first guild I was in was from EQ.   I think they barely got through MC by the end of Vanilla.
---
i just answered your question, i never claimed it would make enough of a difference or anything
---
The rank 14 guy will win the majority of the time, but a skilled player in blues can still put up a great fight and win occasionally. I am not saying they are on equal footing by any means.
---
I’ve been following my classic wow countdown more than my own wedding countdown... if that gives any indication of my future
---
Also paying for a chance at a beta is ridiculous
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
Charge into a pile of people and intimidation shout. Oh how wonderful it was.
---
Not my experience playing Alliance in Vanilla though...
---
BFA has like 3-4M subs atm and new expensions launchs always have a populary close to WoW's peak of like 8-10M, that means the players always come back even if they quit quickly
---
All you’re doing is saying why it’s illegal. I know why it is. I don’t think you actually understand what morality is.
---
Basically you have to pay an additional $15 so you can play the stress test. Gotta love blizzard
---
Good luck :)
---
I'm getting married 2nd of August and is back from the honeymoon 25th, just in time for release.
---
No worries will be looking forward to seeing another one :)
---
Works in Naxx too, for anyone reading and thinking you have to stop tanking after MC.
---
Blizzard can sue as long as they're not red state actors.
---
WoW Classic is going to destroy the market for janky private true-to-game servers.
---
Private Servers have existed since Vanilla.
---
I want to see you nerds out telling Nintendo to give the old bootleggers props for the idea for the NES Classic Edition.  I used to be able to buy a bootleg NES console for $20 in Santee Alley.  Why you're at it, don't forget to buy a janky tshirt out of the trunk of some dudes car for $10 on your way into your next concert instead of giving it to the artists who are performing.

**&lt;Hope Rises&gt; - casual-friendly/“mediumcore”**
---
Greetings, travelers!
---
Do you love Classic WoW as much as the “hardcore” and “semi-hardcore” crowd, but want or need to enjoy the game with more freedom to play how and when you like? If so, then we may be a great fit for you!
---
&lt; Hope Rises &gt; is a guild I founded back in 2014 on the principles of positivity, loyalty, and freedom. Though our Mythic team eventually transferred for greener servers in Legion, the guild will be getting a rez for Classic and we plan to keep those same guiding principles intact! As such, we already have a stable core of players confirmed to return who are highly loyal and dedicated to the guild’s long-term success. In conjunction with our founding principles, these are our guild’s disctinctives:
---
* Though some of us will be putting hardcore hours into Classic, we will “officially” raid just once per week on Tuesdays (+50 wife points)! **Raid time: 8 or 9pm Central start time (we’ll take a guild vote to choose when the time comes), raids will last 3-4 hours as needed**
---
* We will also have optional raids on Saturdays at roughly the same times as the official Tuesday raids (again, we will choose as a guild)
---
* It is a priority for us that we all have the freedom to show up to raids (particularly early on) with a suboptimal or PvP spec so long as everyone is also willing to change to a more meta role if the raid becomes stonewalled or profoundly inefficient because of it (this will likely only be necessary way down the line — like AQ-40 to Naxx).
---
* We will select a well-populated PvP server that does not have any major streamers on it.
---
* Many (but not all!) of us want to savor Classic at a calm but steady pace (though pure speculation, I envision most of us being raid-ready approximately 3-4 months after launch, which averages out to about 2-2.5 hours /played per day). A few of us will still no-life it. :)
---
* We will also have numerous casual members whose primary interests will be leveling alts, playing the AH, farming gold, etc., so there should always be guildies to level with at your own pace.
---
Many of us have raided for years at a competitive Mythic level in retail WoW. Though we are a competent group looking forward to crushing PvP and raiding through Naxx, enjoyment of each other’s company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame is our top priority. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a “world-first” (lol), cutting-edge, every-world-buff-is-mandatory hardcore raiding experience, then our guild is not for you. If, however, you jive with our vision of Classic and would like to join the family, or would simply like more information, feel free to comment here or DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355).
---
Thanks, everybody! Hope to see y’all in Azeroth!
---

---
&gt;All you’re doing is saying why it’s illegal. I know why it is. I don’t think you actually understand what morality is.
---
You're the one who thinks it's ok for people to copy work and then get donations for it. Please explain why it is ok for someone to not get paid for what they made?
---
It takes us out of the possibility that people want to get on their main to stop a level 54 from corpse camping their alt in STV on layer #2 or whatever.
---
If you’re absolutely trying to min/max the absolute hell out of your Druid for *feral*, then sure, BoK is better, but the differences aren’t so huge that it makes Alliance better in a clear cut decision. 
---
Feral isn’t as much of a memespec as Balance, and faction doesn’t make a difference there. As it is, your willingness to farm MCP is more important than faction as far as Feral DPS is concerned.
---
Those cuff links are bad ass he should totally wear them, most people don’t notice cuff links anymore so it’s more of his own little Easter egg.
---
Jesus Christ stop with the super speed run times. The average person isn't a theory crafter that has SUPPORT to help them level. That's like saying it's easy to get R14 because other people have done it. 
---
You aren't getting to 60 in under 100 hours on launch. The first day will probably shit the bed, which doesn't affect his /played, but it does affect his 6 day period. The next few days especially are going to be flooded with people. You're seriously underestimating the amount of people going to be in each zone. It will be more than any private server you've played. 
---
The average person probably takes 8-10 days to get to 60. Let's stop using hardcore speed runners as a god damn bench mark.
---
Super dumb question but what does clipping auto shot mean?
---
People about to find out why queues are important.
---
100% should wear them! Most people don’t notice cuff links anymore anyway so it’s your own little Easter egg. But if they do notice, it’s a great conversation starter!
---
or if youre a bad hunter
---
This is where I got almost all of my enjoyment. On Draenor in TBC, we regualrly played against a Twink guild named Pizza Hut. I loved getting matched up against them. I still think i'm the entire reason why they started having people make priest twinks.
---
Feral Tanks are viable on both sides, they're much much better than people remember. I'm not even sure I'd say they're a meme spec, they're just good.
---
That said 1% Dodge is better than 5% Health. If you're really min-maxing just for tanking, Alliance is better. 
---
Maybe you could argue that since the thing that Druids do very well is threat generation and Blessing of Salvation kind of undermines that; maybe they're better on Horde.
---
Windfury buddy
---
Yeah I was quite happy for a late summer release.
---
Exception if I'm doing a dungeon with them, then they get goodies and a portal at the end.
---
Whats amazing is the boars in Westfall need different parts, between Loch Modan, and Redridge. But like hell you have the bag space to carry 40 dead pig organs around between 3 zones &gt;,&gt;
---
You have forgotten all the punctures the Russian and Chinese spies have made in the tubes under the Atlantic ocean stealing people data.
---
Why would you even consider playing BFA when Classic is out???
---
I know that they've more or less laid out a roadmap for the months following release. MY dream for WoW Classic, is the Old School Runescape approach. OSRS, essentially is the same game that we played like 12 years ago, but it runs far better than it used to, and new additions are voted upon democratically as to how far along the updates should go. It'll be even stuff that are little micro updates like weapon balancing that wasn't present in the original game, they pose it to the players and ask if it's something that the players want. Now, years after OSRS has launched, they've added entirely original quests and content that weren't present in the original, yet it all still fits the overall feel and aesthetic and doesn't steal anything from the product.
---
In regards to further expansions, I guess it could be cool to have separate realms for different expansion stopping points with maybe the option to clone your character to the next realm over if you want to take your guy to the next region.
---
Ah yes the age old time equals skill argument
---
He asked if it was possible. It's absolutely possible.
---
The diffence to feral dps is gigantic, windfury is shit on cat
---
I didn't know that druids had issues in 5-mans until seeing people bitching about it on reddit. I've never heard of that. I played all of the healing classes to 60 in vanilla. Maybe it's a little harder on the druid, but I don't know. 
---
I think you can handle it -- the game is not very hard!
---
Do you want me to quote a source that says that Nostralius created their server because they wanted to play vanilla WoW? I think that's pretty implied, don't you?
---
**TGIF is Recruiting!**
---
NA Alliance PvP 
---
Server Discord: https://discord.gg/zeUCYFm 
---
DKP Based Loot System (loot council for legendaries) 
---
Recruiting: All Classes/Specs/Roles
---
**Intro:** TGIF was created by a few typical, mid-30s, former raiders. After searching for 1-night a week raid guilds, we found none that fit our mutual availability...and so TGIF was born! TGIF was created to provide busy adults with the opportunity to see Classic WoW's raid content with the most minimal time requirements - 1 night, 3 hours a week (even during progression). We understand that the limited raid hours may result in slower progression in the later phases of vanilla, but we're excited to build a community and progress as efficiently as we can during our raid-time. Also, we think that there are probably a lot of other talented players out there who want to tackle Classic, but don't want to have to push work, sleep, or family obligations to the back-burner.
---
**Expectations:** Given the limited schedule, we need to have strong participation and preparation. We require a 75% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. We will start raiding as soon as we have a critical mass at 60, hopefully 2-3months after launch
---
**Schedule: We will raid Friday from 10-1am EST (7-10pm PST).**
---
**Optional Scheduling:**
---
Organized PvP Premades 
---
PUG Raiding: 40man raids will be hosted on Saturday/Sunday for any unfinished content, and no TGIF preference given to those who can or can't attend. 
---
20 man raids TBD
---
If you are interested in joining, please join our discord or send me a PM with questions. See you in Azeroth!
---
I recently recovered my EQ character and ... yeah, that game was clunky (they also added a lot of stuff since I quit). But I would play a remastered version in a heartbeat. Better graphics and smoother animations. I don't feel the need to "remaster" classic.
---
It was never considered until TBC and some devs fought against it even then.
---
I am intrigued now... what or who is the "OOGA GANG"?
---
Slowly. Park him in an Inn in the first week. I'm just gonna work off the rested XP.
---
Min-maxxing would be for me to have my alt hit 35 and be an Alchemist... but I would be kind of disappointed to not be an Alchemist on main. 
---
Probably gonna have to do it just cause Engineering is so much better than other professions in vanilla WoW.
---
Streamer idolization + BFA hate - the subreddit is reaching a new low
---
this is easily the most over the top pseudo-elitist comment i have seen in this subreddit
---
it would be incredible satire if that was the intent
---
#TIME IS MONEY, FRIEND
---
&gt;Except, I’m an adult. I have a job, house, girlfriend etc.
---
I said you were childish, not that you're a child. 
---
&gt;I think getting ganked is part of the game. He doesn’t. That’s fine. But I’m painting a picture here to show where I’m coming from.
---
I agree that it's fine to hold either opinion, but that isn't what you did. 
---
&gt;Why YOU personally took offense to this I don’t know but acting like I’m childish for having a different outlook on this is stupid.
---
I made it very clear why I called you childish, and it wasn't because you had a different outlook; it was the manner in which you responded. You suggest I'm emotionally invested into this conversation, but creating a strawman argument shows strong desire to prove yourself, to the extent that you would be intentionally dishonest in order to make yourself look better. 
---
&gt;Play on your pve server lol. 
---
I'll personally be playing on a PvP server, FYI.
---
&gt;I hate this whole free time argument too. Like Jesus where do you draw the line? For now it’s PvP - later it will be item prices driven up by people who can farm because they have more time etc etc.
---
This game isn't the first to have PvP, but despite that being the case, what you describe hasn't occurred. In all likelihood, this is due to prices generally going down as the supply of goods increases.
---
I would think a stress test on a weekend would bring in far more players and for longer hours. Ive been fortunate enough to be in the last couple stress tests. but the middle of the week times severely limit my ability to play or test.
---
Shit man. Monster Hunter as well. Hunter Horn and bows/bowguns. Support is an awesome role in games. I like the Winter's Chill build on frost mages, buffing the other mages in your group, but there aren't many other classes that are "viable" in a support role. Which is a major bummer.

# &lt;Nevermore&gt; [US][Horde][PvP]
---
Server TBD (Not a “Streamer Server”)
---
Nevermore is a huge community of gamers with a LAN party feel. We’re like that team from Varsity Blues – always in the hunt for another title, but you know, small town feel. And whether you’re Mox, Tweeter, or Billy-Bob you’re going to love it here. Coach Kilmer’s need not apply. 
---
Our gaming accomplishments are legend. Super Mario Bros? Yeah we beat 8-2. We haven’t finished yet, but who really has? Our K/D in COD is almost 1.1. Rocket League? A couple of GOLD tier members are kicking around. Obviously kidding. We are kind of big deal though. Check us out @ nevermorenation.com if you want the scoop. 
---
Here’s what you need to know. 
---
Raid Info: Tues, Weds, Thurs 9pm ET - 12am ET (We’re working on a second more casual team for the weekends) We’ll be using Loot Council. 
---
We realize RL is more important than a video game. *That one wasn’t a joke*. 
---
We are all adults here, our time is valuable – so when we come to raid we’re going to be respectful of your time by being prepared and ready to rock come game time. 
---
We’re going to be competitive. We have the resources and experience to contend for server firsts. We are putting together a PvP team with several interested in the rank 14 grind. 
---
We embody the ideal “No better friend, No worse enemy.” Getting ganked in STV? Chances are we’re going to catch a Zep and make it out there just in time to die by your side. 
---
But then you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to perpetuate a targeted smear campaign against the “gankee.” All back channel though. It’s not coming back on us. We’re smart like that. 
---
We’re going to find out who his high school girlfriend was, we’re going to show up to Planet Fitness and she’s going to fall in love with us. His high school reunion will be ruined. 
---
We’re going to bide our time and wait patiently until he’s just about to ring the gong for Scarab Lord, and we’re going to send Moose to drive into the power lines in front of his house. 
---
In all seriousness big guilds can be intimidating, but the reason we are so excited about Classic isn’t the 15 year old content. We’re ecstatic about the return of COMMUNITY. Going out into Azeroth and hanging out with your guild mates and just seeing where the night takes you.

Classic would be better off if the Nost guys were managing it.

Ultima players dobt like evercrack players?

Is it kind of like the dislike skateboarders and rollerblades have for each other?

I also don't mean any offense by this, but I would hardly say they were canon, just because you could get a Brewmaster in WC3. They were never tied into the story, and nor should they be. There's a whole universe of quite involved story lines and character arcs that just had to bend to the atrocity of the story telling in MoP and WoD.
---
starting zones will be a mess. anything to take away from this video is just grind
---
There are two scenarios here. First is ninja pulling, where the dps decide to pull something. That's a case of bad dps.
---
The second is dps ending up body pulling additional packs through the fight, either by standing behind the main target and thus being ahead of the tank, or by chasing down runners.  That's a case of bad tanks. It's on you to tank the mobs somewhere that won't happen - I've seen a ton of times in leveling dungeons where a tank will stand somewhere he won't pull additional mobs, but if the melee dps stand behind the mobs as they're supposed to, they will always pull another pack.
---
He's posting on reddit to find out if it's possible. I don't think he's done that research or practice. Now, he does have 70 days... but I'm not sure that level of research and practice in the next 70 days is worth 50 bucks.
---
It doesn't have to be the same game.  They are completely comparable in this aspect.  Blizzard always said people DID NOT want classic servers and it was all nostalgia.  Old school runescape proved that players want and can sustain a player base for a classic version of a game.  OSRS has more players on a daily basis than the current version of the game.  And they also update OSRS and add content to make it fun because endgame in RS is pretty limited when it was released.

Twinks have little to no effect on the market other than to make it healthier and more robust. Assassin's blade creating a flow of cash from a level 60 who pays 200g for it and it going to a level 19 payer who found it by accident in SFK is not "bad for the economy"
---
World buffs are not an exploit, but they are a very damaging feature of the game that wasn't properly evaluated at time and therefore didn't need a solution.
---
Witu today's knowledge however they dwarf content like no other and I'm sure in such situation Blizzard would've acted.
---
Truly they stood on the shoulders of giants
---
Hi nineteen, this is Xetoll from warensemble, the best geared hunter on shattered hand....post korgath transfers of course.
---
Listened about 10 minutes of your interview on the countdown podcast so I don’t know if you mentioned this:
---
https://www.dropbox.com/s/5teafeitxv4d7v3/dnt_relentless_lethon.wmv?dl=0
---
Any plans to add a option to select your PvP Rank? Like I appreciate that your site things I can manage the Grand Marshall grind, but I’m more looking to Max out at 11 for the 2set :P
---
You’re thinking too much about it
---
If you mean they wanted to make vanilla WoW, then of course.  If you mean they wanted to make Blizzard Classic servers, then no.   
---
But you are right if you just mean they wanted to make a vanilla WoW server. Of course.
---
First in for both main and alt on day 1.  Play the alt two days a week to burn off rested XP only.  Hope to be near 35 by the time the main hits 60.
---
Same. I get no joy killing players just trying to quest, and it's no fun when I pull two mobs and get stun locked by a rogue and die.
---
Hunter - Having to level pet. My only choices are the winterspring cats or the ZG serpents if i ever decide to switch pet choice.
---
be gone swine
---
Just because you don’t have access to the beta, doesn’t mean you don’t have access to sarcasm
---
More like: "More time invested =/= more fun when played"
---
Still not worth the price of submission. See you guys in August.
---
\*Pulls literally 1 mob too many, healer insta leaves group\*  
---
I mean... I did ask.
---
Love some of these suggestions. Could be really cool if flying mounts were just mounts that could sustain time in the air for more extended periods than the standard jump and gave control. Could also add elements of having to balance... some sort of game play while on them. Could be interesting if different flying mounts had different capabilities. I.e. dragons fly fast but can’t fly long and gryphons are easy to control but difficult to balance on and wyverns are more gliders and so can’t do much ascension
---
Feral tanks are fine for most forms of tanking. I wouldn’t put one as a MT in a 40m raid but outside that you’re Gucci.
---
&gt;Nosediving 
---
Were they really? WoW was losing subs but the company as a whole *nosediving.*
---
They're *a* catalyst. Not *the* catalyst as the post says
---
No, it is not more fair whatsoever. You're using a main character to gear up an alt preying on inexperienced low level people who don't have a higher level to gear them up. At level 60 you can't be boosted like you can at lower levels, so a level 60's gear is far more earned.
---
Only get brought in for bosses, basically you get boosted
---
Soon this will be filled with twitter handles
---
Battle.net oauth would be a big improvement instead of having to make yet another account for something
---
In theory, if Blizzard gets layering to work how they want, the starting zones shouldn't be *that* bad.  One of the things they specifically want to avoid is having brand new people log in and then be lost and confused because there are no boars (or whatever) to kill for their first quest.
---
The leveling experience, especially if it's your first time playing, is much more enjoyable if you quest the whole way.  Quests provide the stories that help create and flesh out the entire world.  Grinding is pretty much never necessary, and certainly not at low levels.  Outside of possibly the first few hours and maybe the first evening when everyone gets off work, I don't think there will be that many issues with leveling.
---
Warrior - the most overplayed class with way too many retards diluting the respect we could get otherwise
---
Lol ClAsSiC wOw ReQuIrEs SkILL
---
Just roll hunter. The whole class is a pvp spec.
---
don't worry there's actually a pretty decent variety in your healing spells as shaman. totems are a blessing and a curse, some melees really get angry when they lose 1 second of windfury :D
---
It doesn't matter if *you* think it's worth it. That's up to OP to decide. He was looking for confirmation that it is possible. Now he has that confirmation. Up to him to decide what to do next.
---
No it wasn't. Wow is where it is now because of the expectation for innovation with each expansion. To add something new... A cool feature perhaps or what have you.
---
I'm building a classic wow website. My way of saying thanks is using the logo for the home button. https://www.competentcasuals.com/
---
Thanks Nost team. Because of you and the community we're finally getting offical servers. Can't wait.
---
fuck no
---
Lol, and u keep replying to comments like it's actually doable for the average person, and some of your replies insist it's actually somewhat "easy". Comes off extremely arrogant. The world record is 4 days 20 hours. GAME TIME. He has 6 days REAL time. Not a chance in hell he makes it. Even a world record runner won't make it in the first 6 days.
---
 First day is basically gone due to server issues and queues. That leaves 5 days. If they make world record speed, that means they have 4 hours to sleep/eat/bathroom in those 5 days. Still "absolutely" possible?
---
Casual.
---
If by occasionally you mean when the 7 planets align on the day of the total eclipse while the river runs red and the shadows take life then I agree.
---
I prefer to hate both
---
Okay you win
---
Just in case you are planning to go druid, make sure to wait until 16 to get the aquatic form quest which sends you to westfall anyways
---
 No way I could get something like that approved (Nor would I want to)
---
You mean those rogue videos that were made before they fixed rogues?
---
Hey, I'm in the same boat as OP. Thanks for the suggestion. I'd like to do this. Looking around the Blizzard shop I can't find out how to though? It let me download the game but I need a key. Do I need to pre-purchase Reforged or where can I buy Warcraft 3?
---
Try it, buddy. You won't find this addon in the results. The description isn't very search engine friendly either.
---
&gt;Please explain why it is ok for someone to not get paid for what they made?
---
They did get paid. An hourly wage to make the game. Unless you mean Blizzard, the company, that is now comprised of entirely different people than the ones that made the game? (And is itself an entirely different company now "Activision-Blizzard) Well they also got paid. Billions of dollars. Then they stopped selling the product.
---
Tell me, do you think it's immoral when people copy famous paintings? [What an immoral sack of shit the kid that painted this is!](https://imgur.com/MNs7pdp) Give any potential ad revenue from that to the estate of Da Vinci!
---
They are very entertaining. The triple bleed openers and then them vanishing off while the alliance player just bleeds out is hysterical.
---
These are dope man. Especially dig Sunken Temple. Scarlet Monestary looks like Halloween, which, given the graveyard is fitting I suppose.

&lt;Envy&gt; PvP Server, Alliance | PvE Raiding Guild | EU
---
Envy are a long-running guild from private servers and retail looking for additional players at launch and beyond for semi-hardcord raiding, utilzing a transparent loot-council system.
---
But first, let me start by giving you some general information about us.
---
History:
---
Formerly known as Millenium, Inside Job and Cobra Kai across various vanilla servers; we as a guild have been able to achieve consistant progression through content from release, while earning a position among top guilds. We’ve also accumulated a massive amount of vanilla information over a span of several years, and it’s safe to say our resources are some of the best out there. We are a moderate raiding guild with an experienced core that has been together for over two years now, and we plan to continue our success come Classic.
---
Raid Times:
---
Wednesday, Sunday and Monday
---
17:30 BST - 21:30 BST
---
Our raids take place on Wednesday, Sunday and Monday night at 17:30 until 21:30, and we prefer our raiders be available for slighty longer on Monday nights for progression periods; currently looking to start MC progression within three-weeks of launch. We will also host optional ZG raids (once released) throughout the week at the same time. We are currently seeking exceptional players of all classes and roles at the moment, though healers are always highly sought after.
---
We have big plans when Classic comes, but we can’t do it without your help! If Envy interests you, you can find more detailed information on how to join by visiting [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/)
---
Additionally you can contact myself (Ancilla#0140) or probability#1475 on Discord via DM for more information.
---
yea you lost the bet unless you have an extensively laid out leveling route that you know front and back and play for about 18-22 hours each day with the variation depending on what class you play
---
I think In 2004 beta our characters didn’t get wiped.  Too many years gone by to remember.
---
lol at the undead rogue thinking he is a rarespawn
---
&gt; First day is basically gone due to server issues and queues.
---
What do you think all these Stress Tests and Layering are for? Blizzard is trying to ensure a smooth launch.
---
Getting to 60 in under 6 days *is* easy compared to a lot of other human feats.
---
&gt; Even a world record runner won't make it in the first 6 days.
---
Care to make a bet?
---
Definitely not that rare, but I guess we will see once classic is released. Rogues alone in even semi decent blues can take down much better geared players by utilizing CC properly.
---
I wanted to take time off too but Classic is such a slower game than retail.
---
Also I don't really plan to rush to 60 so I don't mind being "behind the curve".
---
The absolute worst I can remember is getting In a group to do strat/baron hiking my ass all the way out there, summoning the 2 missing folk, then being kicked from the group.   Oooh I was heated for a minute.
---
You blow this way of proportion. 9 agi is nothing. Know what actually makes a difference? Stone form vs rogues/shadow priests.
---
But 9 agi dude!!
---
Still, do you have a source? I'm not doubting it just actually curious how it went down in their words.
---
did you work on Red Alert Games?  Red Alert 2 and Starcraft were my childhood
---
Sent you a message; I think we are a weirdly good match!
---
It's more like 
---
"but, but it's my class fantasy and I'm going to play it despite there being FAR too many people trying this very well established trash spec in raiding"
---
What kills me is it's not like Ret is this super fun spec to play. Especially in raiding. I just pray it isnt as bad as it was back in the day. My server had as many people that were trying to raid as ret Pallys than as fury Wars. I'll let that sink in for a minute. Made recruiting an absolute nightmare
---
I will be leveling a Druid second. Depending on how quickly our guild gets ready for raiding I may start leveling him right after I get my epic mount. 
---
My main is going to be a Human Warrior. I’m going to level mining and skinning on the warrior as I level. 
---
When I hit max I’m going to farm all the mats for black smithing and engineering. After the Druid is 60 the Druid will be my herb/miner. Going to level the Druid with herb/mining. Druid will farm my mats for the consumables sharpening stones/bombs etc. 
---
Will probably be a while before I make a third alt but will be a Dwarf Priest Tailor/Enchanter. Going Alchemy/Tailoring on all my other alts for the cool downs except hunter which will be my Skinning/Leather Working toon. 
---
If the Druid takes to long to get to max I’m going to drop Skinning for BS first so I can make resist gear.
---
EU💔😪
---
Don’t worry - he plays on a pve server anyway.
---
Twinking on retail has been one of my favorite aspects of the game for a while. Although blizzard just seems to want to kill it off with each xpac lmao.
---
Nostalrious will have a longer and better run than classic will because Blizzard wasn't there to fuck it all up. Until they stepped in and fucked it all up.
---
I thought they were called cookies?? 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
It was the fastest selling expansion ever. 2 copies? It sold 3.4 million copies in the first day. It actually amazes me that you think sales really determines if something is good or not. You can make the best game/movie/phone but if people don't even bother to give it a chance it doesn't matter, how is it that difficult for you to grasp?
---
It's a reflex at first. It usually takes a couple of times before you notice that they are screwing around... Unless the tank informs me. If the tank says you die. You die. It's hard to find a good tank.
---
People call them classic because that's the name that blizzard chose to brand their vanilla wow instance. The fact that Nost met with Blizzard suggests they were interested in playing classic wow rather than simply wanting to create a private server "just because".
---
As a manager. I understand. But I also told everyone that I'm taking a week off starting August 27th. So sorry but request denied!
---
What a post.
---
Without geocities, myspace would never have existed...
---
They’re a group of 3 troll rogues that primarily gank, but it’s more than that. They’re becoming a thing of legend. The sort of things make alliance children afraid of the dark. It’s hard to quantify the impact they’re having on the community. It’s all tongue and cheek but it’s injecting something wow has been missing for a while now. Fun.
---
Wak-a-mole is more fun than mashing 1 button on a single target and just not standing in fire.
---
This is hilariously wrong
---
Thanks. I had a lot of fun! Pity you're on the PvE Internet.
---
For raiding, they aren't very useful (even in terms of damage they suck) but the toys can be fun for cosmetic purposes at least (world shrinker for example)
---
Are u new to gaming? Stress tests are included in nearly every game, and every game has launch issues. Major or minor. Getting to 60 in 6 actual real life days isnt easy lmfao. You're some random who reads theory crafting guides. You couldn't even make it in 7 real time days.
---
6 days is 144 hours. If you sleep 5 hours a day, that's 30 hours. Eat/bathroom an hour a day, that's 36 total.  144-36 is 108 hours. The world record is 4 days and 20 hours, which is 116 hours. So, EASY to you is faster than a world record? You're a fricken idiot man.
---
Awesome thank you!! Any idea why it's set to UK time? I'd figure their announcements would be in PST since they're located in California lol
---
Look I think you are getting too far removed from the original discussion. All OP said was that Nost shouldn't be getting rewarded for ultimately stealing IP. Which is already incorrect, because Nost DID get the reward and growing this community and seeing what it's become, just not monetarily. 
---
Everything else has been spot on from him. He's not saying Nostalrius was full of bad people, just that we don't need to glorify them. They ultimately profited off of stolen IP and that's not a standard we should set. You were the one who tried to call him a bootlicker and they tried to argue nuance. Nuance is important sure, but it's by that same token that we shouldn't be glorifying Nost because the general public is not going to be able to see the nuance in the situation.
---
Also, he just said that pirates should be fined, which is a totally normal response.

---
Pretty sure I have a "nice" rig.
---
I can't think of a single pre-raid instance where this blanket statement applies. Can you point out just one boss or even trash pull where the tank has to pull in order for the group to survive?
---
Getting into a guild there will likely be no difference. 
---
Dungeoning without a rez could be annoying, but it’s easy to fix. Bring a dps who can Rez, or a warlock who can summon. You can use your battle Rez out of combat too if you don’t think you will need it later or if a death was super inconvenient
---
Glory to the sin'dorei hero
---
&gt; Rogues alone in even semi decent blues can take down much better geared players by utilizing CC properly.
---
much better geared yes, THAT much better I don't think so. A rank 14 has too much armor and hp to be taken down that easily.
---
okay that video was insane :D
---
EU have always been second.
---
Nothing new here buddy
---
You almost gave away my super secret level grinding area in Goldshire!
---
Rogue: that their cooldowns, which they are so reliant on, are so long. Also, fuck fairie fire &gt;. &lt;

we take a moment every week to do this.  make it a sticky already
---
Nah, I'm a real grown man, rather than some incel shut-in bugman, so I have other shit to worry about all day than vidya.
---
I had just heard about that the other day while watching a twitch stream. Doesn't seem to do the trick for me as well as adblock did. Are there any additional settings I should turn on / off after installing it to chrome?
---
&gt;the hand that feeds them
---
People have been pressuring blizzard to bring back vanilla servers for over a decade. Nostalrius wasn't even a thing until 2015 lol.
---
Acting like Nostalrius is the sole reason Blizzard is re-releasing their own game is pretty fucking dumb.
---
Trust me there will be plenty of toxicity to go around. That idle chitchat turns into white supremacist hatespeech very quick on the private servers. A lot of nazis are going to be very disappointed when they get their permabans and have to retreat back to their private servers. But in the meantime, we'll have tons of toxicity and then some.

---
- But most important: to have fun together!
---
Expectations:
---
 From our socials: Be nice :)
---
 From our raiders:

---
- Loot assignment will start with a moderated DKP/EPGP and might change to Loot Council in later tiers.
---
To join us come to our discord https://discord.gg/35jZ3C3
---
Just an assumption, but each sever will likely have anywhere from 2-6k people on it, who knows 🤷🏻‍♂️ There will likely be multiple guilds on each server, on each faction that will need to build 40 man raids. Join one of these guilds with your buddies.
---
Very cool. Wouldn't recommend getting married, tried that three times and the repair bills were astronomical.
---
But still, very cool.
---
Oh the Amani forest trolls, yeah they and high elves added simultaneously make sense.
---
You can make a hundred gold in a couple hours of farming but when you factor in how much raid mats and enchants for new gear cost you’re talking a lot of gold per week when you add in that extra 100.
---
I have nothing but pure disdain for the phrase “poggers” but the way payo says/uses it does get a chuckle out of me.
---
&gt; Than what the fuck you call someone who puts as much effort into doing something as possible? 
---
A good and effective player.
---
You're confusing someone who tries hard with someone who is a tryhard.  A tryhard is someone who tries hard but its superficial. Someone who tries hard and is effective at their job is a good player.  The best raiders in the world, getting world first are NOT tryhards.  They are actually trying hard to be the best at all times.
---
Tryhards are people who like to appear to be the best, by popping consumables on aoe trash pulls to top the meters, but when it comes to the boss fight they pop the same consumables as everyone else but end up being at the bottom of dps meters because they can't dps while dealing with fight mechanics.
---
Imagine actually thinking this
---
I do not know if they will keep legacy server names, but if they do, I'd assume the same population will go to that server. I.E. I want to play PVE Alliance, so I'm going to Stormrage-US. If they make up new names, it's a gamble and it'll take a while for populations to settle down, so you may need to move servers or maybe paid transfer would be a thing. I imagine PVE servers will have majority alliance and PVP will be majority horde. That's just speculating from excitement on why people are playing each faction.
---
Theres an old saying that I cant recall where I heard it but is a great way to view this predicament you're in...
---
"Any sufficiently advanced technology will look like magic to those unable to grasp it"
---
And that's the way I viewed the reasoning behind the steampunk vibes.  In a way the denizens of outland had twisted technology and magic together and attempted to use it to their own ends (think of Netherstorm's Mana Forges). And to be fair the more egregious and notorious uses of technology in TBC were done by evil NPCs)
---
Why am I seeing this shit everywhere
---
Already been confirmed that it will be a fresh batch of names.
---
Thanks for the quick response - the emails appear to be working now :)
---
Really impressed with the effort put into this.
---
One thing to note - I'm not sure if it has been confirmed if all MC boss' loot tables will be in their 'final' state during phase 1, or if they will be updated in phase 2 with the additional drops added later (E.g. Brutality Blade in patch 1.4 and Onslaught Girdle in patch 1.5).
---
I had assumed that all MC boss loot would be present in the Phase 1 list and thought the filters were bugged until I realised the items added later are filtered until Phase 2. Might be confusing for some users who were not aware that the MC boss loot tables changed in this way, esp since many will make the same assumption that all MC loot would be visible from phase 1!
---
Thanks again mate, really great work.
---
That means it’s 70 days till my next day off work too!
---
Well... nothing I said really had anything to do with me being stupid or not.
---
Yep. Once upon a time I had a macro on my orc hunter for level 19 WSG. It was along the lines of /target [name of specific elf rogue], /hunters mark, /pet attack. (with a darkshore cat to boot)
---
If I saw a this particular elf in a battleground I knew shit was going down. Was great fun.
---
You are absolutely awesome for doing this!!
---
Honestly just hop on something you agree with your friends about and explore. There's probably gonna be some guy in your friend circle that really wants to go on X server because of other friends or something, and you can all follow along.
---
The server names and such aren't released yet, at the very latest it will happen 2 weeks before launch(you will be able to create characters 2 weeks in advance), so you will have some time to decide before the game actually arrives.
---
Tanks runs in , makes MANY friends with mobs ..dies.
---
Healer posts "..ok back".
---
IDK what you did at Westwood, but kyrandia was my jam back in the early 90s, and resident evil was the scariest game I'd ever played when I was 10. And I know you guys put out a lot of other stuff too. Wherever you all are in your careers right now, I hope you all know that the work you did back then was really important to a lot of people, and it's still appreciated today. Get the rights to the kyrandia series and put it out on switch. I'll be first in line.
---
Accurate means releaseing the game in state as close to as it was back in the days, and the patch they chose to recreate was 1.12, which includes world buffs in raids.
---
&gt;Is this what Blizzard claims?
---
Absolutely, and theyve been very clear about that.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1925
---
&gt; There is a section of the community that will try to get every advantage available, though, and collecting world buffs will end up being an additional burden on some of those players.
---
Is that not their prerogative? And if they routinely seek these out, they are fully aware of what it entails. I seriously struggle to see how this is a negative. The bottom line is that you do not have to have the buffs to play the game. There will be guilds that use them and guilds that don't. If you find like minded players in their regards to world buffs, this becomes even more of a non-issue.
---
Awesome. My buddy and I played Rogues in vanilla and definitely made some enemies of alliance on our server, although were not really cheeky about it like these guys. That sounds like fun.
---
I'm pretty sure I did maybe it didnt send on mobile
---
I booked the week after release off, starting September first. I'm hoping things will be tame by then
---
This is just another sub with moderators who hate fun.
---
Im a ele sham, and Ive never played vanilla leaning towards rolling a sham healer ⚡

You can PvP 3-4 hours a night at 60 and hit rank 10 for the PvP set in a couple months.
---
I used a hunter to farm materials for raiding but there was always too much competition for gear with DPS. The only dps character I ever raided with was a death knight. I had fun topping the charts while they were still extremely overpowered.
---
Then make the bet. You pay one year of subscription time if there's a single level 60 player by 6:00PM EST Sunday, September 1, 2019. I pay if there isn't. I'm happy to have the manager at my local credit union draw up a contract and hold the escrow.

May i ask where you got em?

I never played on a PVE server until a couple of years ago.    I actually enjoyed it a lot more.
---
For classic, I'm probably going PVP again because southshore and redridge nostalgia too good to pass up.
---
One of the reasons i got into wow was because my buddies brother was in a serious eq guild (I distinctly remember him saying "they ate gods for breakfast"
---
He rolled a mage on vanilla launch day along with the rest of his guild.
---
How much time did you spent playing vanilla pvp?
---
I remember on the shut down they took a lot of shit from people too. people called them pussies and said "just ignore the letter or switch the server to russia. They stuck to their values and it paid off for everyone. Absolute heroes
---
the only issue druid has healing 5 man is lack of rez. everything else they are fine at.
---
That first comment. We rolled them nearly every single time we went in there. But my guild had a ton of top end PvPers sooo that might have had a thing or two to do with it.
---
Serious question: for those of us who quit a decade ago, if we re-sub, we won't have BFA, right? If we quit before Cata, what happens if we re-sub without buying Cata?
---
most times they put are in pacific yes.
---
Update: Removed 1h enchants from phys dps classes pre-BWL. 15 agi/str are not implemented until BWL hits. Also from peer pressure I changed the feral druid enchants from striking to agility/str and with this removed the weight/sharpening stones.
---
ramblings of a mad man...
---
Worded perfectly.
---
And it was structured that way intentionally, I'd put money on it.
---
I have yet to be killed by them. Course I didn’t really solo from 30-40 so. But I’ve heard about them. Hits me in the nostalgias for sure. “Server Famous/Infamous” players. Not streamers that I know of. But they are well known on the server. 
---
We used to do the old “AFK Paladin on the Road” Trick. I would put up AFK and sit on the road in horde zones and wait. When someone traveling would jump me they would be quad ambushed by my rogue crew. Good times.
---
I read once sentence of this and closed it. It's just not funny because the present is always the most depressing time of ur life right m8s
---
&gt;. They just put much more experienced and skilled coders on the team for Classic.   
---
From what I understand many of the senior folks at Blizzard have gone the way of the dodo and have been replaced with folks who 1) Weren't part of the original WoW team and 2) Have no idea what made WoW great, its lore, or really anything about it.
---
My favorite Twink was a bis 49 enhance shammy in BC I remember waking up early checking the AH before school looking for those boe blue 1 hand axes that had a random stats. Was so satisfying finishing him absolutely deleting people with windfury procs.. you didn't get the same feeling at the time at Max bracket... Skill or not it's a different meta. You can hate but it won't change twinking being some of my best memories of wow.
---
Sounds like you are making a big assumption because you lack any real evidence.
---
They didn't get wiped between closed beta and open beta, but they got wiped between beta and retail.
---
It's 1pm Pacific. 2 Mountain 3 CST 4 EST. At least according to the post on MMO-Champ.
---
Yup. Plan on playing the 29 bracket with a shaman to be sure.
---
This is false. No one has mana unless you're playing with all melee.
---
r/theyknew
---
I just don’t care enough to argue with someone I wasn’t even originally talking to.
---
Omg yes. The kobolds!
---
Put it on an RP server and you have my Sword.l.p.
---
Yes. Modern wow has more to offer high end hardcore players who play for the satisfaction of completing mythic raids or pushing the highest mythic keys. 
---
But despite the ever-increasing focus on accessibility and quick gratification in modern wow, I think classic is more friendly for a new player. It's more intuitive and it encourages meaningful interaction with other players better. And perhaps equally importantly, unlike modern wow, gearing in classic feels meaningful and satisfying.
---
So what if one rogue is bored one day and decides to get world buffs for fun? Or if someone happens tp get ZG and Ony amd WCB dropped on them? Will you make them remove the buffs to raid with your guild?
---
If you let them keep them, tgey will destroy the damage meter. Now loads of dps is going to want to get those buffs next time. People dont like getting smoked on the meters. 
---
This is what happened to our guild. Start casual, noone caring about wbuffs. But one slightly more try hard guy snagged ony head and songflower before raid everytime. He would top the meters. People wanted to conpete for top, so they started getting buffs too. Eventually its the norm.
---
Definitely 2.
---
Thank you!! Right when I get off work :D
---
Hahaha...
---
Try this one: [Wayback Machine Thottbot](https://web.archive.org/web/20060701050840/http://www.thottbot.com:80/)
---
At the time I had a 70 holy pally that I raised on and simply didnt have time to play him and level another toon to Max and be able to grind gear that gets anywhere near to as powerful as a good twink has.
---
A lot of ret pallies back in the day tries to play it like a warrior
---
Focusing more on Attack Power or AP
---
That kind of ret doesnt get good until t2 and beyond.
---
They didnt know that all our best gear before t2 comes dungeons. Is focuses on Spell Power and Attack Speed
---
Our best weapon in the entire game is out of gnomeragon 
---
Its why blizzard revamped ret in cata with HP.
---
No one figured out paladin is developed to be strongest and best class in the game. You just have to get really techincal to see it. Which no one did.
---
You get all content except BFA. This includes Legion.
---
oh yeah they took bag slots back in the day, I hadn't even thought of that. Being a warlock my primary mount was a spell anyway....
---
But lvl 25-30 is when it just starts to get juicy for world PvP
---
Misdirection ain't a thing yet, though :/
---
OG EQ players are more hardcore gamers than just about anyone. That shit was brutal and there was literally no hand holding.
---
Vanilla WoW pales in comparison.
---
This is a perfect example of the OP's point. Assuming that is actually Fony, the 19 twink with a reputation for being a great player, is running premade v premade on a priest only displaying half of his team's bars. On top of that, he moves like a clicker.  
---
I've had a lot of fun in the 29, 39, and 49 brackets, and this level of play is terrible.
---
Like I said, Blizzard has very talented programmers with a ton of experience.    
---
There are many people at Blizzard who played WoW at launch. It was those people who pushed and made Classic servers happen.   
---
Blizzard is huge. Plenty of people at Blizzard see "what made WoW great, its lore, or really anything about it.".  Of course.   
---
Blizzard changed the game.  It doesn't mean staff there don't understand the pros and cons of original WoW vs. current WoW.
---
Most of my time playing was in pvp, I got to rank 10 before the removed the rank system.
---
IE and I was gnome mage named Bannik.
---
I was part of almost everybody's GM climb.  
---
Hung out in IF and dueled everyone naked so they wouldn't complain about my gear advantage.
---
Also had a few server-only enchanting recipes for a while and made people jump into the lava at the forge in order to do it.
---
Here to say. Emerald Dream was the true OG for blizzlike classic. Most came after I believe.
---
It’s a blue post for America and Australia. So we will read in blue post from our language something else in my eyes.
---
Undead! Orc zone will be the worst.
---
Get ready for that spell dmg arcane shot Hunter :)
---
Warlocks damage scales alot more with gear than mages though.  Warlocks cant compete until they start getting AQ40 gear

AFK spots are for fucking losers and I hope they offer a reporting system this time around for it.
---
Do we have to own BfA or just a monthly sub?
---
This precisely.  I don’t have time to gear multiple max level characters that I want to play.  I’d rather be at the top end of gear in a bracket I’m playing rather than the low end.
---
Lmfao a contract? Escrow? For some online bet with some random guy(probably a kid considering a "contract" for a measly 180$)? 
---
I don't give 2 fucks if there is someone who doesn't sleep, plays 24 hours a day, and hits it on the dot. But I tell you what, it won't be some average person who posts on Reddit. Get a life man, this whole post was sad as fuck
---
In your experience what was the grind like to hit rank 11? This is probably my main goal for classic.
---
this is actually smart. if i played ret pally, you'd better believe i would show up every raid, fully buffed, full consumables to try and beat other people in DPS for the boot.
---
I agree. It was fun pulling undead strat timing the perfect slow ass gun shot on a patrolling mob. Plus initial aggro means they're running to you, that is until the priest bubbles you while they're on the way thus starving you of rage and therefore threat.
---
Skyrim belongs to the Nords!
---
You'll have access to everything before BFA. A basic account and subscription now gives you everything except the newest expansion.
---
Meh... I've gone crazy waiting for classic since the announcement... But my stupid ass is going off to basic training at the beginning of August. rip me
---
Wouldn’t it be pacific? Almost all times blizzard posts are PST or PDT cause that’s where they are headquartered.
---
You should go back and watch some of the old PvP videos. They click so many things. They don't "look like clickers," they just are.
---
Awww!!!
---
Ah, so you're a coward not willing to put up a measly sum to back his opinions. That's what I thought.
---
11pm
---
Over a second rogue, sure. Over a second mage? With the polymorphs? Nah. I'll settle for only one aura amd one blessing thanks.
---
To piggyback on that, would it be possible to have BoE(world drop) and BoE(crafted) separate in the autofill function?
---
Like I don't mind getting crafted gear, but don't want to rely on world drops.
---
Aside from that: have my sincere compliments on a site that is both quite useful and very nice to look at.
---
Inb4 horde tears regarding AV.
---
I can understand all the arguments about how streamers can fuck with you by having a massive army or people going after you for accidently doing something, but how the hell does the economy suffer from a streamer server?
---
Also Faction:
---
PVE: Alliance is easier sure, but horde is at least twice as fun
---
PVP: Ally is way more fun in premade play, but alone horde reigns surpreme yes.
---
Having a feral tank, but not giving the melee group leader of the pack is a pretty big sacrifice though. Also you would be missing omen of clarity too, 10% melee dmg and chance on hit for free spells. 
---
I think hotw is fine if some kind of flex spot is needed, but you risk being a little bit too useless. If you are that spec, and you are even the slightest bit lazy, you will be deadweight.
---
In the beta. Not in launch version
---
This is typical "I've seen World of Roguecraft 3 times and now know Vanilla PvP"-talk. 1.12 rogues aren't like that, and unless we're talking dumb matchups like Warrior-Mage, a player in lvl 50 blues is not going to win against a R14 player.
---
This was funnier the other day.
---
I'm trying not to see a negative in this but something feels a tiny bit off in promoting being subbed as a requirement to be in with a chance of getting into all three stress tests, and then openly inviting everyone from one region into the second test. Blizzard could have at least put a note explaining why that decision was taken and perhaps indicate if the third test will see a similar situation for EU based players.
---
I think so lol
---
Nostalrius&gt;Classic Beta
---
And the meta and community of seeing twinks you recognized and would go back and forth with is somthing haters don't think about.    It's just a different braket with different balance that takes less time commitment to be relevant.
---
Looks pretty awesome. What language do you use to write this?
---
...me has rage that's ticking down while your mana is ticking up.
---
Thx! I'll give it a read. Will be interesting to see how close it is to my original vanilla build
---
6 days real time? Just pay your brother right now. If you do it in 12 days real time I’ll send you the money you lost.
---
BIG. FUCKIN. MOOD.
---
&gt;Well they also got paid. Billions of dollars. Then they stopped selling the product.
---
World of Warcraft is still playable. Just because the product changed from the first version doesn't mean they lost rights to it.
---
&gt;(And is itself an entirely different company now "Activision-Blizzard")
---
Not relevant. They own the IP, they decide what to do with it.
---
&gt;Tell me, do you think it's immoral when people copy famous paintings? What an immoral sack of shit the kid that painted this is! Give any potential ad revenue from that to the estate of Da Vinci!
---
That is protected under copy law and as long as you sign it under your own name it is legal. That doesn't apply to using code/models/designs made by Blizzard. And if the kid did get money for it and claimed it was the mona lisa, then yes he should get sued for it. That's intellecual property crime.
---
Good idea lol
---
You played ret wrong all those years.
---
You should of be a SP ret and not an AP ret.
---
The only gear you need until t2 comes from dungeons.
---
Your best weapon in the entire game is a mace from gnomer
---
You dont go AP ret until you get full t2 and a strong 2hander (which your guild were fucking idiots to not give pally two handed weapons.) Since only warriors could make use of them and by t2 they should be fury.
---
And i plan on being the 2h shockadin in pvp.
---
Who gives a fuck about stress testing EU servers... we will have the classic launch experience it seems like!
---
Priest - I don't want to play a dwarf to be optimal..
---
That's why you pick a feral druid tank!
---
Oh wait, about that Rogue...
---
Great website, I did find one small issue though. Auto-filling an enhancement shaman pre-level 20 selects two-handed maces &amp; axes when that isn't possible (talent to equip them is level 20 minimum).
---
My position isn't my own cynical view.  It is an opinion of a former employee who worked there, saw their approach to games (within the past 5 years) and left.  If I hadn't heard several stories I would be shutting down people talking like this, too, because it's usually baseless.
---
Active = subscribed
---
I bind moves I use a lot to the wheel but iirc you can bake /petattack into your attack macros, too. So, say, hunters mark and /petattack? Or am I slipping here?
---
A coward? I shit out 180$, hell I shit out 1000$. Why would I make bets online with some kid who probably lives at home? You're a nobody, stop acting like some arrogant speed leveler and go watch your streams. Even if I was wrong, I'd rather burn the money than give it to you.
---
 And btw, there's no accurate way to test this. If someone were to get 60 within 6 days, that means they shared accounts. I don't count that as making it to 60 on their own in 6 real time days.
---
It's treated like a big deal BECAUSE
---
Big man, good on you my dude.
---
Bug:
---
I notice that Hive Defiler Wristguards (AQ40) are appearing in the list for Phase 4 (ZG/Green Dragons).
---
Cheers.
---
These aren't tips. They are the mad ravings of a loon. Horde have an BG advantage omg and streamer servers had me in tears it was so funny.
---
I watched lots of pvp videos when I played in Vanilla. I and most decent players had at minimum their major stuff bound. While clicking was more common in Vanilla than TBC or after, it doesn't mitigate the fact that this player is bad.  
---
Also, clickers look like clickers, so I don't understand your third sentence.
---
It must be named Hooters.
---
Again, all you are talking about is legality. Couldn't care less about it. That isn't what is being discussed. Nothing that you have said makes it immoral.
---
I remember it the other way. EQ players laughed at WoW players for playing such a casual carebear MMO.

**&lt;Incarnation&gt;** Alliance **|** NA-PvP **|** Hardcore
---
Raid Times: M TU W 7-10pm PST
---
System: Loot Council
---
Hi Everyone! Incarnation is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community.
---
We are a fresh guild, meaning that we do not have “core members” or “clicks” yet like many other guilds. Just because we are fresh does not mean we lack experience. We have a wide range of experience ranging from World competitive Naxxaramas clears in Vanilla WoW (14th), private server Naxxaramas clears, US server first endgame content of different expansions of WoW; as well as multiple PvP achievements including but not limited to rank 14's in vanilla wow, rank 1 arena gladiators from various expansions and even pro gaming experience through various games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining.
---
We expect all our recruits to know their class, game mechanics and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic.
---
We are hardcore in the sense that we put a lot of time in preparation for the raid (farming consumables/pre-raid gear, knowing all boss mechanics) so that when we do zone in to a raid, we are fully prepared and ready to clear. We are raiding 3 hrs per day for only 3 days and not excessively long hours because we pride ourselves on using raid time efficiently.
---
**Goals:**
---
\-Build a positive and strong community.
---
\-Strive to effectively and efficiently utilize time invested in the game to be the top guild in the server.
---
Warlock x2
---
Druid (resto) x1
---
Paladin (holy) x1
---
Obligatory all exceptional players consideres. (People in our guild switch classes sometimes so even if your class is not listed, do apply! We are looking for good players with positive attitude!)
---
Please apply on the website at [https://www.incarnationguild.com/](https://www.incarnationguild.com/) or contact ephy#0620 , iggy#1473 using Discord. (When filling out the application please be descriptive! It is hard to know who you are if you are answering each question with just one sentence!)
---
Thank you and we are looking forward to hearing from you!
---
&gt;A couple of the server owners were ex blizz employees, so they sat down with Blizzard in attempt to negotiate Classic.
---
This is not true. If you are talking about Mark Kern, he did not own Nostalrius. He endorsed the signatures and brought the petition to Blizzard HQ.
---
If you’re world buffing like you should, being on time is critical
---
Man they are really milking vanilla for everything it’s got. Even pre release.
---
True, my non subbed account is marked as Inactive.
---
Its mix of auto acct healing aura and seal dancing.
---
But your like impossible to kill
---
Pvp wise the object is just out live your opponent
---
What is the difference between emulating a formerly "dead" version of a game and receiving donations, and streaming a AAA title on Twitch and receiving donations?

Is it morally grey to stream now too?

Wow. It’s like Classic WoW brought the Autism out of hiding.

Well considering he doesnt click anything the entire video... I don't understand your entire premise. I'm also really happy that you watched those videos when you played vanilla. Watch them today, it's embarassing.

Yes plz keep trying to play ret pally like a warr. 
---
Save me all the good raid spots. I want corrupted ashbringer
---
At 60 classes have all the skills and talents they need. 
---
Yes gear discrepancy is huge, but by the time naxx rolls around catch up gear and crafted gear is easy to obtain. So its not as large as fresh 60 to naxx.
---
You can 1v10 people in the 19 bracket if you have bis gear. That does not happen at level 60.
---
Have you been able to test [if paladins are still the best for watching porn?](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/3123314553)

I still say the power difference in twinks is more. Consumables/trinkets put it even more over the edge. You have engineering and 250 per tick bandages, and a the arena trinket that will absorb an insane amount of damage.
---
You can easily win 1 vs 3, 4, or even 5 fights as a maxed out twink.
---
WoW alone made 325 mil last year. Guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
---
If you're talking about dungeons, why are you insisting specs matter? Vanilla 5-mans could be done in any combination of spec, as long as people knew what they were doing. The 10-mans could be done with incomplete groups in quest greens.
---
That's what I thought. I'm just going with the information I've seen on two different Blue Posts.
---
&gt;Again, all you are talking about is legality. Couldn't care less about it. That isn't what is being discussed. Nothing that you have said makes it immoral.
---
If you don't care about legality this conversation is over. I'm not going to discuss morality with someone who is ok with crime.
---
From a moral perspective it is wrong because you take a thing that someone else made and earn money from it. Or from a machiavellian perspective it's wrong because you take power from blizzard. Or you could look at it from a kantian perspective and argue that you are diminising the joy that blizzard employees feel when people play proper retail.
---
There are so many branches of morality in ethics that saying "it isn't moral" is a pointless argument. I could argue why torture is morally right to do if I wanted.
---
Classic Cast #15 watch if you’re interested. He said the two head Nost devs were at the Blizz meeting and he hasn’t heard from them since. He could be under NDA for all we know as well. This is the kinda thing you’d wait for a Blizz Con or Launch to announce I would imagine. 
---
Could be maybe Blizz paid them to just go away and destroy the code they had?
---
Could all be tinfoil hat who knows?

&lt;Short Bus&gt;
---
NA, Alliance, PVP **Gnome, Dwarf race required**
---
(Casual/Semi-Hardcore)
---
  You read that correctly, Short Bus is a guild recruiting only Gnomes and Dwarves. We are a mix of OG Vanilla players and players that have raided all content up to MoP, this is however still a guild in the making, so how great we are or are going to be is going to come down to us as its members or something philosophical like that.
---
 Looking for more interested in joining a guild that will progress through current content as released. This is not a sissy millenial guild, think more buff fish millenial guild. We will talk shit. Just a part of our humor. We are 4/20 Friendly, and definitely snack friendly. We will be active in both Pvp/Pve, shit maybe even some RP if you're into that kinky kinda shit. So if you're slightly retarded but open to constructive criticism, then you may be a perfect fit. 
---
Raid times will be a dedicated 2 nights a week. TBD: However the earlier you join the better chance itll be during a time that fits your schedule as they will be voted on to determine the best time for everyone. 
---
Looking to fill a roster with members that are actually interested in playing with the social interactions of a guild. Rather than mute/solo players. Roster size we're aiming for prior to Alts =120. Wouldn't make sense to have a large guild in such a Short Bus.
---
&gt; knowledgeable private server players
---
F O U R T E E N P E R C E N T
---
You don't need to be e resto for raiding, depends on the guild you raid with. Not all guilds consists of elitist jerks demanding min/maxing everything!
---
I actually played in vanilla from open beta until cata so I am not just talking out my ass based on some videos I watched. I may be thinking of pre 1.12 pvp since it all blends together. Dumb matchups still do count though I don't know why you can just discount something like mage vs warrior or rogue vs priest because it favours a certain class. in mirror matchups yes it is insanely hard for the guy in blues to beat a R14 geared person, but that is only the case 1/8 of the time.
---
Don't tell him about the mine!
---
Nifty Stopwatch and Skull of Impending Doom are forcing a flag drop in warsong if activated. According to wowhead, Nifty Stopwatche forced a flag drop as a feature in patch 3.1, not 1.12 or earlier vanilla. I am unsure of skull of impending doom.

---
That's fine. You going to hide from me, maybe go somewhere you're untouchable? Run and hide now. ;)
---
I mean the point of a remaster is to bring new polish to already great games at their core, so... it kind of fits perfectly?
---
They only had like 10k players max. If they had millions of people they’re servers would be far worse than what blizz provides.
---
Balanced PVP should always be the goal. Just not 1v1. The biggest mistake, IMO, was making 3v3 the meta, when RBGs or even 5v5 could've led to much more fun/unique compositions.
---
Thanks. And that video has like 30k views so I was super happy about it. Glad it was helpful tho!
---
Depends on class, too. I've beaten warriors with an equal gear gap as a hunter with the AV xbow. Not warlocks, though
---
Yeah, not sure if they added it on after or I just missed it but they answered it at the end of the post, active sub required but you don't need BFA.
---
What i said here is not sensationalist.  It is what happens to world of warcraft in every fucking expansion.  People try to emulate whatever the top players are doing, and anyone who doesn't keep up is shunned and left behind
---
When everyone jumps down the ledge and the hunter pet follows the loooong way around.
---
The video game industry is absolutely inundated with remakes, remasters and rereleases...including Blizzard themselves Remaking Starcraft and Warcraft 3, but clearly this is all from Nost, yeah?
---
Not to downplay what they did. The creation and maintenance of that server is an achievement to be proud of, but it doesn't need to be oversold.
---
The difference is everyone competes to gear geared at max level. And as time goes and you get gear, the advantage is diminished.
---
At twink brackets you are fighting people who will never get geared for that bracket, they are momentarily in it while leveling. Honestly twinks just ruin the experience for levelers. 
---
Twinks should get their own queue.
---
Noice
---
You have same amount of buttons as a fury warrior, just saying.
---
I mean I see where people are coming from if they just get the quest and then try to do that quest directly.
---
I guess I learned after doing barrens a dozen times that the zebra and raptor collection quests you just did as you just did at your leisure when doing other quests.
---
A bit like Blizz did to make WoW inspired by Everquest too.
---
Whatever. There are many people at Blizzard who hold the same views as everyone else about WoW.   
---
If you just mean the people working on WoW, and only the people making the decisions, then you have an argument.     
---
Blizzard is huge. The idea that thousands of people all share the same view is simply not true.
---
Crimson (Horde-PvE) is recruiting.
---
We are a group who have been playing and raiding together for several years now, and are looking to step into Classic and progress at a quick pace. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding but go hardcore preparing for and during raids to make quick progress.
---
Goals
---
To be the best guild on our realm, and one of the best in classic, while we maintain a good quality community of friends.
---
What we are looking for 
---
Solid players who want to push the limits of Classic and their class, while also being reliable and able to make our raid schedule.
---
Looting 
---
For our 40man raids, Loot council is current plan, though DKP is still on the table. In 20mans, when available, we will generally roll for items except a few exceptional items.
---
Schedule
---
Our tentative raid times are Monday: 19:00-23:00 CET Wednesday: 19:00-23:00 CET Thursday: 19:00-23:00 CET Sunday: 19:00-23:00 CET
---
We shall use extra raid days to do guild dungeons, 20man raids, and farming when 40man raids are cleared for the week.
---
We require 90% Raid attendance.
---
If you are interested. Message me on my discord Oulous#4513 or you can apply via our google doc https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11JF0rQKy_JjLpj32w1uO-fxZrCyi-rj2Rh9fQ_cCIgc/edit

I dont think its that bad at all. And you said trim some zeros, as in plural? Even if they trimmed the mininum of zeros which would be 2 zeroes, that would make classes do 300dps? Thats even less than classic. Idk man i might be wrong or you might have worded it very poorly but it seems like you just wanted to shit on retail with a very poor argument that when someone said didnt really made a lot of sense because they already did that, that you backtracked and were like uh thats what i meant.
---
i guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one rofl
---
"What happened? Why are we dead!? I put the AFK tag on, damn it!"
---
&gt; Sounds like WoW isn’t your game my friend.
---
It used to be until twats like you came around and whined like fucking idiots until they got their way. Not if I make a statement that I miss how it was before that you say that it's not my game? Fuck off.
---
Bit like old school blizzard in a way.
---
Hi, GenitalJouster!
---
I am stopping by to wish you the best day, and the best year!
---

---
Nah i call you the useless
---
Wut? His guides are free online...
---
He knows that, broadcasts it even. 
---
I'm fairly certain the add-on will just be an in game version of the guide, and free.
---
I could be wrong though, only time will tell .
---
&gt; Could be maybe Blizz paid them to just go away and destroy the code they had?
---
They didn't pay them anything. They just used the thread of lawsuit to make them stop working in Nostalrius.
---
 [https://github.com/rsheep/VanillaGuide](https://github.com/rsheep/VanillaGuide)   
---
\^ Was a solid tool for 1.12.1 WoW leveling. Guides are built into it.
---
Also a possibility!
---
One is accepted and permitted by copyright holders, the other isn't.
---
How does the population of a 15 year old video game explode?
---
yea I hear you. I just did a hunter to 20 on the PS and the barrens was pretty competitive. I guess a little easier with an instant cast tag.
---
You're right. He is moving like a clicker (which is what I originally claimed) because he appears to be spamming a mouseover dispel macro the entire time, thus the keyboard turning, running into trees, etc.. Still bad movement, but much more understandable than clicking abilities.
---
I'm honestly going to push hard, for whatever it's worth, to keep the honor/BG phase as far along as possible. As soon as that phase hits all the try hards and streamers will be in BGs, and WPVP is going to tank hard, all over again.
---
It's a nice endavour. But this will be completely eclipsed when Zygor or Dugi classic comes out.
---
Yep, it's insane how many people want their dick sucked for having played on a private server as if they personally contributed to anything.
---
Bruh gonna have to find a Starbucks for name day
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah, just need to question anything and take private servers as an example. Even if it's a legit concern. BÄM POM hate
---
Without private servers we would never have Classic, but whenever someone mentions private servers on here, everyone looses their mind. I am so tired of cata babies just jumping on another hype train, good thing is half of them wont even make it to lvl40, unless Blizz fucks the gameplay *fingers crossed*. #nostalriuswasawesome
---
I'm planning on having a hunter main with skinning/leather to make my own devilsaur set as well as fire resistance cloaks for my tanks (and maybe a few spares).
---
I plan on swapping to mining/engineering afterwards, so having my bank alt also gather ore to smelt through the leveling on my main is the current plan.
---
Probably won't start on the alt until I approach 60, and probably won't level it much until I'm farming Onyxia and am able to skin it.
---
You made the post at 15:12:21 EDT June 17 2019.
---
Servers go live at 18:00:00 EDT August 26 2019.
---
That's 70 days 2 hours 47 minutes and 39 seconds.
---
That's 6,058,059 seconds.
---
You were off by 3,599.24 seconds, which is 59 minutes and 59.24 seconds.
---
So, yes.
---
One at 19 and one at 29. Each have a completely different feel to the entire WSG play style. I loved it.
---
You’ve never needed to have the latest expansion, just an active sub.
---
Wow spamming AoE for 20 mins, such fun.
---
I'll have to ask my fiance she ordered them online not sure where.  They were a present.
---
Yeah. I think Teldrassil didn’t have bears? Either that or I missed them completely. Don’t quote me in that please. I miss the epic pets, too. I waited in the Barrens for an hour one time to get some special fancy lion after I fought a Tauren hunter there for the same thing and died. I liked their melee abilities, too. Like. They weren’t stellar melee combatant, but I just liked having a sword and a bow and a pet and stuff. It was awesome.
---
Who cares about the steps in 21century, the outcome is valueable only, end of sad IRL story.
---
Yeah, I forget the expansion, but AV bonus weekend was AFK level your Alt weekend. And it was marvelous
---
Same thing for my warrior vs a rogue in much better gear using my AV spear.
---
&gt;If you're talking about dungeons, why are you insisting specs matter? Vanilla 5-mans could be done in any combination of spec, as long as people knew what they were doing. The 10-mans could be done with incomplete groups in quest greens.
---
I already explained why. I invite you to read over the comment thread.
---
good thing my alt was a sham for you dirty kid loving pallies
---
lol people can wear whatever the fuck they want at their own wedding, it’s *their* wedding.
---
Fix'd then
---
Great site! Can you make it so you can select a preset for stat weights and then make a custom one by changing a few values from the preset? I don't want to add every single stat.
---
CRBG say hello
---
Again, this is anecdotal and sensationalist. I have played every expansion and do not share this sentiment. I play what I want and have never been shunned or left behind.
---
&gt;I think it is worthwhile to discuss possible content Post-Naxx which diverts from the TBC route.
---
I do not, tbc and wrath fans deserve their favorite expansion recreated just as much as we deserve vanilla recreated and taking that away from them to create our "classic+" is egoistic, and for blizzard a bad business strategy. Creating new original content is both a lot of work and it's risky, TBC and Wrath should be relatively easy to recreate due to already having a working classic and the changes being more well known, and it's a guaranteed success as people liked TBC and wrath.
---
For the horde!!
---
Lol yeah. The totems just seem fun for flavor. Plus the mana regen and stuff at higher levels is dope.
---
to speak english
---
hunter
---
I used to spend 45 mins - 1 hr before raids farming nagas for soul shards in azshara so I could give each raid member (40 ppl) a healthstone. That was really going above and beyond and not really something that was expected but it was a good way to stand out among the other locks in the raid.
---
Classic wow is full of minor inconveniences when it comes to bag space. If it's not soul shards it's ammunition or something else and honestly it wasn't that big of a deal to keep your bags tidy for soulstones.
---
Blizzard is never going to spend a dime developing content for Classic WoW. Just stop it with these fucking posts.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-june-19-21/200695
---
I'm genuinely excited for how that will turn out.
---
I actually liked the approach of some pservers making raids harder to accomodate for this and preserve the classic experience.
---
Let’s all thank the ManGos team for developing an OPEN SOURCE emulator for these guys to use in the first place.
---
&gt;Is it morally grey to stream now too?
---
You're moving the goalpost. Streaming is allowed by Blizzard, that is the most simple reason. And when you stream the game you are not copying it or being paid for giving access to the copy.
---
There is a massive difference between taking a copy from someone and showing video footage of the original. If I need to start explaining this like this we should probably just stop the conversation.
---

---
What year is it where you live?
---
They also went to blizzard and did all they could for this to happen, even when they had to throw away all their hard work they still stayed with us and pushed this through.
---
 I think they made the most to get the ball rolling. Great peeps 8/10 on the Keanu scale at least.
---
CRBG is like 4-6 servers though at most... still many people of your server will be there.
---
Orc will be a lot worse than undead.
---
Creepy af
---
I am a 16k io tank that regularly ranks low keys for people. So this post really speaks to me. I look for people that have been waiting a long time in queue to get their tank
---
True. They deserve credit.
---
Yea we talk about it here on Reddit like there are going to be healers in abundance offering their services for dungeons. Yet in reality a group will be looking for a healer for 20 minutes and will generally take just about anyone.
---
Did you work on Nox?
---
I’m so hyped up right now. I think the first thing I’ll make is a Night Elf hunter, just for nostalgia. Then a Tauren Druid for hordeside stuff. Bear tanking is good for most things outside of raids, if I remember right. Warriors are the tanking Gods, but I’m OK with a silver medal in tanking if I enjoy it more.
---
&gt; If you don't care about legality this conversation is over. I'm not going to discuss morality with someone who is ok with crime.
---
I've said from my first reply that I don't equate laws with morality. Racism isn't illegal, but it is immoral. Cheating on your spouse isn't illegal, but it is immoral. Throwing an apple core on the ground in the woods is illegal, but it isn't immoral. 
---
&gt;From a moral perspective it is wrong because you take a thing that someone else made and earn money from it. Or from a machiavellian perspective it's wrong because you take power from blizzard. Or you could look at it from a kantian perspective and argue that you are diminising the joy that blizzard employees feel when people play proper retail.
---
I appreciate that you actually started discussing what could possibly make it immoral. What makes it immoral to make money from what somebody else made? Isn't that exactly what the company of Blizzard does? The developers make the game, they get paid a low hourly wage, and the company and the executives makes the millions from it. From the machiavellian point of view, how are you taking power from Blizzard? They gave up their power when they stopped maintaining the game. With the kantian perspective, why would the feelings of Blizzard employees who didn't even work on the game matter? Retail employees who have bastardized the game that people loved could be said to be disrespectful to the people that made WoW.
---
In the end, nobody was demonstrably harmed by it. It didn't take anything from Blizzard, not even money. They copied something that already existed, like a famous painting, and reproduced it to make people happy.
---
I'm torn on re-subbing to take part in this.  I've been wanting to wait till launch to play but this is torture.
---
;(
---
I dont think its about hitting max level as much as it is about practice.
---
Personally i will setup all my addons for launch and then play 2 or 3 hours only.
---
get improved gouge!
---
ITT people responding to you that never heard of feenix, scriptcraft, qgaming, wowscape, nocturn, project westfall, etc etc. you speak the truth.
---
I might join a guild a friend of mine makes, or I might make my own and invite him. Level for DAYS and hella dungeons but we’ll have fun.
---
The topic is good vs great hunter. And i answered for PvE.
---
But we can talk pvp, if you want. Shadowmeld has a 10 sec CD and can be use against every classes to break spellcast, regen, have the 1st shot, force people to go melee and go on your trap to unstealth you etc and it makes solo dungeon a piece of cake.
---
Stone form is used to hard counter rogue every 3 mins (which hunter is already a soft counter)
---
Dispel the dot of UD priest, and remove bleed to bandage against  warriors.
---
So much utility.
---
I made my choice :), as many great hunter.
---
9 agility is a lot when you min/max. If you want to be an average hunter, suit yourself we don't care.
---
Most definitly won't get them 60 full geared but i'd love to have a rogue around 30-40 to play sometime. It's like pokemon, you have a whole team, but you still have one pokemon you play more than the other and who's 20 lvl ahead. Yet the rest of your team's still here !
---
It's for people who needs the feeling they are better than others, but have to do it in a way they know they will be a lot more op, since they can't otherwise.
---
Oh boy I repressed the memories of WotlK DKs. What a load of bullshit they were...
---
Rebuke only came in cata
---
I argued with a guy on the main sub about this. He was adamant classic wouldn't pull 20K lol
---
Poorly tuned websites can absolutely cause lag on really any kind of rig... they just eat all your CPU and RAM. Especially with some cryptominers installed.
---
For sure, just take it slow and immerse yourself in the world.
---
Yes you'll have fun leveling and at 60.
---
Just don't feel rushed to hit 60, enjoy the weeks / months it takes you to level.
---
Lol who’s childish now
---
Do you mean how Feenix and Scriptcrwft failed and the top raiders from both servers pushed for a new vanilla and even paid for the hosting? Yeah no.. most didn’t start anything. Wowscape has 4 times the number of players and they got shut down. That 250k petition literally did nothing because blizzard was already in development of classic at the time the petition went live. Check dates, don’t act like you know everything g.
---
Nox best game!
---
TLDR: Priest is probably better but the player is more important than the class.
---
I'll answer point 2 first because it is easy.  If you're in a cutting 
---
edge guild then you should not be wiping in dungeons, so not having a res isn't a big deal.  There will be very rare occasions when it all goes wrong, but it isn't frequent enough to worry about.
---
In my experience, you're most likely to have deaths when doing stupid shit.  Eg, lava skipping in brd when someone lags out.  If you just stick to the beaten path then a guild group should be able to deal with bad pulls and adds.
---
For point one, if there were an unlimited amount of good healers then you would want twice as many priests as druids.  In practice, guilds would prefer to take the best player from the available priests and druids.
---
The weakness of the druid is that their heal takes 3 seconds to cast, while the priest heals in 2.5 seconds.  This is obviously a large advantage for the priest.  For horde, priests are the only class with a defensive dispel.  For alliance, (dwarf) priests can get fear ward.
---
A lot of people might say that Innervate is a big advantage for the druid.  It's a good ability, but not nearly good enough to make a druid as good as a priest.  The real big things that the druid brings are combat res and nature's swiftness.  For horde, NS is diminished because shamans can do it.  For alliance, lay on hands is a 40 min cooldown that uses all of the paladins mana, so druid's are the only class that will have an instant big heal available for every boss.
---
Warrior tanks will always be in demand.  They're the only class that gets the full array of tanking tools.  I'm not saying that other classes can never tank, but I am saying that other classes are not nearly as good as tanking as warriors are.
---
It’s so good
---
They have a 3rd party addon installed in their browser that turns it into an emote for them.  There are several, and yes they are dumb.
---
&gt; I heard that it’s using the more updated game client and not the one from 2006 though
---
The only updates that they have added to the game are better physics and textures for select environmental effects in the game, which are optional. 
---
You'll be fine.
---
This just means that you can choose it, not that it was added. All the wikis say it was added in 2.0.3 but I firmly remember it being added in during Vanilla if the player had no pvp titles
---
In my opinion it is always worth trying out a game. It is the only way you ever know if you really like it.
---
I don't know anything about molten-mc but if we are givimg nostalrius credit we should also give credit to earlier vanilla servers that made nostalrius possible in the first place. Feenix deserves a mention for example as well.
---
Yeah there’s just really no reason to ever take a ret paladin to anything. 
---
Not saying don’t - it’s fine if you want to. But I can’t think of a logical reason to do so.
---
I used to play PvE as a youngster. Can't say I had anything but a blast... However I am more competitive now, might have to give PVP a roll, especially with a few new friends as backup this time around.
---
And the vender for Alterac Valley is super close for repairs and bag clears
---
Its a test, so they need to have workers to monitor it, thats why they do it on weekdays.
---
There's no initial cost besides the subscription so yeah definitley give it a shot.
---
If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault.
---
If the tank dies, it's the healer's fault.
---
If the DPS dies, it's their own damned fault.
---
You're welcome to disagree. I just think the health pools, mana pools, and the damage done is too big. Its literally the first thing I noticed when I started watching WoW content again.
---
If I'm backtracking, its because I didn't know they already did a stat squish and not knowing that I still thought the numbers were stupidly big. I don't play BfA. Its not because you made a compelling argument for big numbers.
---
But I thought layering was bad, I'm so confused
---
ofc the fun stress test with dungeons is not allowed for EU ;&lt; angryface
---
Would use
---
No?
---
The wayback machine isn't so great with search bars :/
---
I’m an old man so I don’t understand what you mean.
---
And then we wind up in the exact same situation we are in now, where people want vanilla again, don't take this from us.
---
You are talking legality vs morality which is not the same.
---
Shaman - unbelievably mana dependent and intensive. You dump your load and then you're done.
---
There will be a few days of TBC timewalking left after the stress test, which might be the most fun thing to do in BFA. I recommend checking it out.
---
Looks good but I don't plan on being an engineer, is there a way to set professions?
---
Yeah he’s full of shit . The last 3 big vanilla private servers rag wasn’t killed till week 2. It’s simply not possible for 40 people to level that quick AND get enough gear to clear the first week. 40 meth fuelled joanas sleeping 8 hours a week might be able to do it.
---
Lol k. You don’t know jack either.
---
I'm in the same boat as you and will be starting with classic. Game is a lot better than what WoW has been for the last ~9 years.
---
Been trying a private server and I like it, but I definitely want to wait for the real classic to get teh full experience. Love the wpvp, and the community is great.
---
Let’s name a few that predated Nost..    
---
WoWScape.   
---
Nocturn.   
---
Feenix.   
---
QGaming.   
---
Scriptcraft.   
---
Scriptcraft 2.   
---
Feenix 2.   
---
Project westfall.  
---
...
---
A lot of projects deserve a lot better recognition that Nost did. And it’s sad to see threads like these from people who haven’t been around the private scene for a long time.
---
You don't keep up to date on info do you?
---
Wiped before retail release.
---
Do you need to install the main client to get this or is there a completely separate installer?
---
That's exciting! I love the idea of a bunch of new server names. It'll make it fun to pick. I just wonder how long it'll be until they release the names/server types so we can start choosing where to roll...
---
I agree on interrupts, not on CC. Not even on damage. I think a game where people can be brought for different reasons than just top dmg is way more appealing than shoehorning everyone into doing the exact same thing slightly differently.
---
MotW is a direct contribution to everyone elses DPS, survivability and so on. Innervate is unique and awesome and so is combat ress. Do I really need to be a top dog healer on top of it? 
---
Classic class balance was FAR from perfect but at least it had character.
---
Lol don’t buy seven copies of final fantasy 7, they are literally the same game. You’re just wasting your money and should listen to strangers on the internet about fulfilling your own personal happiness.
---
Do you see why your comment is stupid and makes you an asshole yet?
---
Minimally, yes. But in reality it doesn't work that way. Like I said, I'm on the west coast of the US and my ping to EU is a lot higher than my ping to Oceana. Your mileage may vary.
---
See? 4hours a night for couple months :) Some ppl aint kids anymore like retail players.
---
Excel isn't lying. You just didn't do the calculation correctly.
---
Thank you, HappyFriendlyBot!
---
Check dates of the petition. Blizzard said in text that classic was on development long before the petition came to fruition. Been around the private scene since we were all on “hackingsource.net” so please tell me again how I don’t know jack?
---
They need to have workers monitoring, unless they want to pay the whole team extra hours they have to do it on weekdays.
---
I really should get mine framed at some point...
---
Game time
---
Its in the normal Battlenet Launcher
---
nice try blizzard, you're not getting me to buy game time
---
I dont understand how pve is even an option
---
I felt this so hard. I'd sit at a summoning stone spamming the group every couple of minutes. "I need two more to summon", "I can't summon alone", "Y'all joined the group, let's get going."
---
Half an hour later people just drop group.
---
As far as I know, no one from Nostalrius is working at Blizzard.
---
Oh reddit, never change.
---
Warriors (main abilities they use 99%) ww, BT, heroic strike, execute
---
Paladin (main abiltiies they use 99%) SoC, judgement, conc, hammer of wrath
---
Then you can add how the rotation pans out:
---
Warrior: mash buttons and prioritize BT, spam HC or execute
---
Paladin: Soc, AA, judgment (dont judge before aa), Conc, during hammer of wrath you have to wait for aa again.
---
Recap: Warriors = mashing, Paladin = timing
---
Pick what you prefer, warriors do way more damage tho.
---
Nostalrius taught me, a TBC babby, that classic was actually really fun. It dawned on me throughout Elwynn that I was grinning and engaged, and that carried me through. RIP Nost and my toons.
---
&gt;Racism isn't illegal, but it is immoral. Cheating on your spouse isn't illegal, but it is immoral. Throwing an apple core on the ground in the woods is illegal, but it isn't immoral. 
---
Those are all illegal tho, unless you live in a 3rd world country with a shit government.
---
&gt;I've said from my first reply that I don't equate laws with morality. Racism isn't illegal, but it is immoral. Cheating on your spouse isn't illegal, but it is immoral. Throwing an apple core on the ground in the woods is illegal, but it isn't immoral. 
---
And I already explained why coopying a persons work and getting paid for it is immoral.
---
&gt;Isn't that exactly what the company of Blizzard does? The developers make the game, they get paid a low hourly wage, and the company and the executives makes the millions from it. 
---
The workers agreed to receive a salary in exchange for their work, making it moral.
---
&gt;From the machiavellian point of view, how are you taking power from Blizzard? They gave up their power when they stopped maintaining the game.
---
They are still maintaining the game, and have actually released multiple expansions for it. You need to stop seeing Classic as a different product from Retail.
---
&gt;With the kantian perspective, why would the feelings of Blizzard employees who didn't even work on the game matter?
---
Doesn't matter that they didn't work on it (they do by the way). It is their property.
---
&gt;Retail employees who have bastardized the game that people loved could be said to be disrespectful to the people that made WoW.
---
That the game has been "bastardized" is your opinion at best. The fact that more people play retail instead of free private servers shows that most disagree.
---
&gt;In the end, nobody was demonstrably harmed by it. It didn't take anything from Blizzard, not even money. They copied something that already existed, like a famous painting, and reproduced it to make people happy.
---
And that was immoral because they took the labour from Blizzard/Activision and earned money for it. Just because Blizzard doesn't lose money that doesn't mean it isn't immoral.
---
And by the way, morality doesn't matter here. We're talking about legality, since I started by saying they were committing intellectual property crime. You can keep saying "I don't care about legality but morals" but that really doesn't matter.
---
I'm going to cut the conversation here short. I honestly don't know why I am arguing with someone who is literally pro-crime.
---
I feel I can agree and disagree with this.
---
While I personally believe that TBC was the greatest period of time in WoW's history and I am comfortable with what WotLK was up to a certain point and I would love to see servers created for them at come point in the future for those who want them.
---
That being said I would be fully on board with a continuation of Classic if any content added to the Vanilla experience was carefully crafted and fit in line with what Classic is.  I don't believe if could be reasonably argued against that if there was any better time in the Warcraft MMO lifetime to possibly implement content that had to be scrapped from Vanilla it would be at a time after the Classic relaunch and all the content phases have essentially run their course.

---
Just in case anyone was running out of OPs troll posts to read.
---
With all the removals, I'm surprised no other action has been taken.
---
I was very much looking at EU-Cyclone, and you can look at it aswell on Hydra PvP videos, which by the way represent quite well the top of the Battlegroup ladder as he got the R1 in all seasons since BC :
---
\-Hydra 8  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLOcI4h\_kg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLOcI4h_kg) late Wrath
---
\-Hydra 9  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY4pgtfU4WM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY4pgtfU4WM) first half of Cata iirc.
---
Where do you see all the Humans dominating the leaderboards ? I saw more Night Elf melees in both these vids than Humans, which actually even surprised me independantly of racials. And again, I have never heard of any PvPer min maxing racials. All this looks like urbans legends to me to be honest.
---
The only way you could donate was paying for the OVH servers directly. No one made any money from working on Nostalrius at all.
---
I didn’t because I could never remember how to spell it.
---
But oh boy when it does
---
&gt;you are fighting people who will never get geared for that bracket
---
Well let me tell you, you only THINK about that it is that way, on private servers there are 8-10v8-10 premades of twinks in each bracket every night. And those private servers are not even retail with crossrealm bgs and huge community from all private servers together in brackets. 
---
You think you know, but you dont.
---
not even tbc, lol retailers...

While the game was hardly ruined because of flying mounts they did have the biggest impact on taking people out of the world, I think. Even with the slow ass 60% mount it's still so much more convenient to fly over terrain and dodge enemy players that everyone was using them all the time anyway. The effect is that almost all danger is taken out of traveling and the very layout of the zones loses significance since it's basically irrelevant when you're flying.
---
All opinion of course, but when people talk about how much fun traveling and meeting other people is in vanilla I think they very often don't recognize flying as being the most significant detractor of that experience.
---
I've never been this hyped for a game release in my life. I'm so excited that I fear I'll get burned out early after launch.
---
I'm sure they have people monitoring the servers 24/7 not to mention continual files saved of the logs of everything that happens.
---
It’s not a matter of being bad , it’s about time to level and gear. Also comparing private servers vs classic is pointless because most bosses on PS are completely wrong. The makers of nost core have have said multiple times that they went through old 240p videos from YouTube and Warcraft movies, and guessed boss mechanic timers and armour values based on that. Sure they got a lot right, but anything that isn’t documented in patch notes they literally guessed and pulled out their ass.
---
It was added in patch [3.2.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.2.0) in WoTLK.
---
Wait, does that mean someone doesn't do this? DPS is a dime a dozen so there is no reason to coddle any of them. Let them die ask 1 time for DPS then pick one of the thousand whispers and continue on.
---
Again moving the goalposts. Try to do better.
---
The team is based on NA, to do a EU test they would have to change their shifts to monitor, do fixes etc. Its a lot easier for them to do it on the weekday on NA work hours, since then they have the whole team ready, thats why they tell on the post to focus more on the first 3 hours, after that mu guess they will only let a handfull of people to feed the hamsters or wet the potatoes if necessary.
---
On the opposite end of the spectrum.

Had the same for my wedding last year

I played on my server's best PvP team, we won essentially every single game we played. It was basically back-to-back-to-back either WSG or AB - we switched from WSG to AB if we kept butting heads with the other faction's top PvP team because while we would win most of the time some of these games in WSG could last hours, so we'd generally swap over to AB in that case. This should be less of an issue because Classic is launching with cross-server battlegrounds so you won't have constant clashing between the top teams over and over on smaller servers (that said, it may be a big fish in small pond syndrome and the friction that slows down your grinding may become worse with x-server bgs since you'll be queuing against even more hardcore teams sometimes).
---
I switched to playing around 8-12 hours every day for roughly 10 weeks after I was already like rank 5-6 (I forget exactly) from standard casual PvP. I was a school kid at the time on summer break. I was actually salty as fuck that I ended up just short of rank 12 before I had to go back to school and couldn't maintain that farm rate. For contrast, my guild had two HWLs - one HWL was an unemployed enhancement shaman, the other was two brothers sharing the same Warrior with one working a day job and the other working a night shift so that they could almost always be farming. 
---
It's probably going to be even worse now, you have a lot of streamers or wanna-be streamers who are going to try to poop-sock the shit out of the honor system. It's doubtful you will hit rank 11 unless you're a kid on a summer break, unemployed, or account-sharing. That's just the reality of it - there's a minor skill component in that you have to be winning PvP to get honor, but once you're "good enough" to be winning the majority of your games it comes down to just grinding the shit out of the system. You're basically in a race against the other PvP teams on your server-  you need to be winning your games, and you need to be playing more games than them. You're also indirectly in competition with your own team, but this is less important unless you're going for rank 14 (which I knew I was not).
---
I don’t understand how people don’t understand what active means
---
Literally all the animations.
---
&gt; I'm going to cut the conversation here short.
---
Fair enough. I'd advise you to look into the legal terms "Malum prohibitum" and "Malum in se" to better understand the laws at work here.
---
There will be crossrealm as it was 15years ago in 1.12.1 :) retailer? change my mind
---
And? What did the hat decide?
---
You should throw in a couple class/race combos you don’t want to play
---
Totem quests are the best!
---
I played on Thunderhorn, the only name I can remember that wasn’t a friend or someone I knew was Kanze, if I’m spelling it right. Regarded as the best mage on the server lol
---
Shams can be tough for sure. tougher than two melee at least
---
Time off: Booked
---
Computer: Cleaned
---
Characters: Named
---
Meals: Planned
---
Guidebooks: Purchased
---
Gonna be epic.
---
Implying privates prior to nost did not exist, nost core is notorious for being garbage.
---
how about we do this.
---
we gank them, if those lowbies want protection, they must pay you and you give me the list of names who paid for protection and I won't gank them.
---
All I ask is 20% of the cut :D
---
Enjoy phase 2!
---
I'd only roll gnome for warriors. If you make it to 60, you might be the only 60 gnome warrior on your server which is really cool
---
Yes, but not the whole team, thats why they tell in the post to focus on the first 3 hours, since thats when all the team will be available to fix any problems, once thats over they only need a handfull of people to keep the hamster fed.
---
Your healer was probably recovering from the near-fatal heart attack your last pull gave him. My Main was a holy priest all through WoD... I‘ve seen things... the horror...
---
I mean rogue mage priest was #1 3 vs 3 setup for like first 5 arena season. Only few brief periods where something was broken like hunter explosive shot.
---
I'm planning on playing a Dwarf Paladin. People pay for a mount at 40??? \#pallygang
---
There will be drama and rage and I look forward to every second of it
---
Will do, thank you!
---
Shaman: I'd probably have to say it's Ghost Wolf being usable outside only.
---
I use firefox and never had to do any tinkering beyond installing it and making sure it was on - it should be on by default and you should have to whitelist sites instead.
---
Your crazy!
---
Hey well I appreciate your opinion
---
I’ve pulled two out and it’s gonna come down to those in a final pull off!
---
That's exactly the kind of thing a lot of PvP server players go for.
---
That's what PvE servers are for, to not get demolished by other players and focus on the other part of the game.
---
Found my account!! It was attached to my college email and I somehow remembered the password and got the security question correct! Blizzard support was able to help me merge and change the email to one i have access to
---
Warrior main, hunter alt. I'm going to level my alt first.
---
It seems just much more efficient to me to speedlevel my hunter to 60 first, not having to worry about being stuck in the zerg and then dual-boxing my main second, basically nullifying the drag that is warrior leveling.
---
Being able to just tag level myself combined with aspect of the cheetah for 1-40 will make it so much more relaxed.
---
Legal /= moral.
---
There are many legal things that aren't moral.
---
But this guys entire argument stems from him thinking that just because something is illegal, it makes it immoral.

Yeah, but you could always use rank 1 frostbolt for the slow. You still have access to CoC and frost nova, albeit without cold snap. It just seems like going fire for single target damage would be solid if you aren't going to do any aoe grinding.
---
The same time it would take to make multiple twinks at different level brackets. Getting just one specific piece of gear from a raid could take months with bad luck.

Isn't that just for the rare set and not the epic set? Point is raiders putting half the effort in get better gear. Why bother in that bracket?
---
do you think its possible to get rank 14 on a twink?
---
Makes the game feel chill for that nice few hours in the evening before going to work in the morning.
---
Yes it is the same and doesn't disprove his point. There will be people in BiS nax gear who suck at pvp but are killing people because they put gear them.
---
I don't want this guy to be the face of Classic. Does anyone agree?

**&lt;Circle of Dominus&gt; | US PVP | Alliance**  
---
Well Met Adventurers of Azeroth! 
---
We welcome any adventurer looking for a **Semi-Casual** PvE/PvP Guild where you can meet new people for the ultimate Classic WoW experience. We believe in a non-rushed, friendly leveling experience where both veterans and new players can thrive. This isn't an exclusive group, but rather a fresh new guild open to any background.  
---
**Raiding:** After reaching level 60 and creating the core raid group, we are looking to spend two nights a week from 9-12 CST raiding, exact days will be ironed out once the group is formed. We will use a Loot Council for distribution of gear. We are not a hardcore group and will not require you to grind out 24/7 or have the best gear ASAP, but we still want members to do what's necessary in order to complete the raids. We welcome those who never raided with open arms. We will teach you how to properly extinguish Ragnaros, Slay Onixia, Storm Naxrammas, and many more!  
---
**PVP:** We are looking to form groups for Phase 3 &amp; 4 for the ultimate PVP experience. We again welcome players who never done PVP combat and will teach them how to dispose of the Horde. 
---
**Social:** The sense of community is what makes Classic WoW a Classic. We are inclusive to all types of players, from the hardcore Grand Marshalls and Kel'Thuzad slayers to the curious new folks first learning about the world of Azeroth or casually playing the game. We have a discord server where players are encourage to hangout and chat together during their journey, and have direct contact to the GM and Officers 24/7 for any questions. We are not here to belittle those who don't have the grasp of the game, but rather encourage a positive learning experience and a fun overall adventure! 
---
**LF Officers:** If you have a good background in private servers/vanilla Raiding and PVP and want a chance to lead/become a social icon, we are currently in search for our future Guild officers! PM me on Reddit or Discord if you're interested. 
---
Hope to see you there! 
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/Qn4PMjM](https://discord.gg/Qn4PMjM)
---
This is a common lie people tell. The whole "We never wanted to pubstomp, we always just wanted to fight other twinks". 
---
So blizzard listened, they gave you xp off so you didn't have to worry about overleveling and put xp off in their own queue so they would only fight other twinks. Of course day one they were screaming that they wanted back into the regular queue and it was somehow unfair to make them fight each other.
---
You say that, but look at a games like OSRS. It worked for runescape.
---
It didn't say these matchups didn't count. I was trying to put across that in certain matchups, gear largely doesn't matter - but in even matchups, you have to be much better than your opponent to stand a chance. 
---
Warrior mage is a particularly peculiar example because unless the mage majorly misplays, there's very little a warrior can do.
---
I do, as I have said one of the largest aspects of classic/vanilla wow is the community. You dont run dungeons cross realm they're on your server people get reputations and you start to see people more frequently. It's not just some rando from server x that you will likely never see again.
---
If I'm going to take PvP as seriously as I do, why would I ever purposely handicap myself by not having the best gear possible? This isn't some participation trophy game. I'm going to be making the character as good as I can for the role I want to play. If I don't feel like playing me Ele shaman. I'm going to make a twink in some bracket that I can mij max in to PvP there with a different class. 
---
Kindly go back to retail. Classic take s time. A lot of time. If you know you work 60 hours a week, set your expectations realistically with what you can actually invest in.
---
Most people will never get Naxx gear or even BWL gear? So tell me how the gap closes?
---
It's also extremely fun. My playstyle in classic is going to completely revolve around wpvp and camping people in enemy zones. Some of my best laughs have been just mercilessly camping people and then never letting them get the revenge they want.
---
Then don’t play on a pvp server.  My two cents as a lifelong PvPer is that you can’t make long lasting relationships or awesome memories without “hardship”.  That is to say, until you’re bailed out by an awesome person while getting ganked by the opposing faction, you haven’t played WoW imo.
---
I am counting on it
---
toxic this toxic that why is there this insane focus on toxicity
---
You should try and buy out of that bet now.  “Professional” runners like Joanna will do it.  You have no chance.
---
I had a buddy who’s brother was a shadow priest. He was horde but treated the game like the ultimate troll. He became infamous and basically you were blacklisted if you found out to be hanging out with him. He would routinely try to mess with the horde players even though he was horde. I didn’t quite understand how someone could become so hated until my buddy asked me to log in to his brothers character one day for something and the amount of hate I received in a brief 5 minute window was laughable.
---
Most WPvP was over specific places in non-PVP servers. Things like one side organizing an attack on some town, just for the heck of it, because we knew the other side would respond and defend. Darkshire and Redridge were popular Horde targets, for instance, and of course there was a ton of Southshore/Tarren Mill fighting. 
---
The main difference is that unless you happened to run by some town (which happened on occasion) and get tagged by the guards, or were actively fighting, you'd get left alone. Thus, the biggest change I saw was in busy zones for both factions, like Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Where do I sign up?
---
But there isnt cause we know what BiS is. There is also a final set of gear at 60 it just takes more time and effort to get. And if your definition of enjoying pvping means winning because you have better gear then I guess you do you
---
I prefer the ingame music.
---
Starting August 13th we'll be able to reserve (3) names on realms, so I'm not sure if that's when the official realm list is released or if we get it slightly earlier - but that's when at the latest.
---
In all seriousness - speed level my main / raid priest 60 asap and get my pre-bis asap. (Engineer)(Tailoring then Ench)
---
then 1 week of hardcore gold farming
---
followed by leveling my gold farming alt (Mage) (Herb/Mining)
---
then level my 2nd priest (strictly shadow priest) as my main pvp'er for BG ranks (Engie/??)
---
Lol, what works for Mama's Corner Shop doesn't work for WalMart.
---
World PVP is fine if you want to engage in it. Stuff like the classic Tarren Mill vs Southshore works just as well when it's opt-in, hence why I never felt at a disadvantage on a PVE server.
---
Joana can have my alt tabbed viewership
---
Was never my experience in private always very peaceful in groups, farming bis, pug raids, guild raid. Sure zone chats are toxic.
---
why's that lame
---
You're right that there isnt much difference. Both take time and having BiS doesnt amount to pvp skill but amounts to pvp power unfortunately
---
No, reddit has spoken. No fun allowed. You not allowed to beat my shitty alt in some lower bracket with your twink, as that is clearly why you're there: to club seals.
---
Haven't
---
Oh jeez, some people can't take a little joke! 😂
---
&gt; 12-18 hours of **ingame** time 
---
Really optimistic...
---
And so it begins, the second coming of the legendary shitstorm.
---
You can play D&amp;D as a combat sim. It is not a roleplaying game unless you roleplay.
---
Roleplaying is a character with a history and making decisions as that character would. That has always been the basis of roleplaying. The mechanical system is an abstraction so success or failure is moved out of the hands of the GM.
---
Damn why did my 11 yr old self never think of that?
---
I agree. There is enough content for Classic and we don’t need more of this stuff popping up. Just play Runescape if you want the developers to mess with a preexisting game.
---
I thought the only reason classic wow is being made is because they happened to find an old server with the legacy code still intact. They had no intentions of trying to roll back current wow code
---
this is indeed old skool, new generation can't read, just watches twitch all day
---
Orc Shaman not even a question
---
People have no idea what they are talking about and loving throwing around that word when it has no objective meaning. There is also an easy solution for people that don't like PvP servers. It's a literal non-issue.
---
Yeah that's true.
---
Even with stuff like cc though, you could give everyone cc without it being homogenized.
---
I do see what you're saying though, there should be both an upside and downside to bringing a class that is outside of a patch meta.
---
Dumb question... Were you part of Afterlife in Everquest?
---
TBC didn't even have xp in BG's.... Never change reddit.
---
pm'd
---
Don't let people die in 5 mans and they're the same except druid has thorns for tank threat. In raids you'll likely be full t1 in under a month. Also welcome to the wonderful world of decursing.
---
On private servers, I had a full feral druid heal through strat ud without wiping, though I was near pre bis tank gear and had holy water from the boxes for quick aoe threat. Usually you would want a priest there for shackle, but tank being able to manage/stack groups helps a ton.
---
Yes there is abuse, and yes making it so that you'd have to have another subbed account to do this is a good thing.
---
People wanted vanilla feel surely... who has said they want it completely static?
---
I think that boat suggestion needs to be fleshed out more. At the moment I can't see it working without it feeling tacked on.
---
The PvP vs PvE decision is going to be the hardest for me... I generally enjoy world PvP, but I'm also concerned about faction imbalance and ossification, and I don't really care for people who get off on ganking.
---
And losing combo points if you dont stay on target.
---
You jest, but that would actually be so cool, and a great reminder of how far we've come when you're looking up at it above your monitor in phase 6
---
every sane person, hopefully
---
but I‘m sure after the viewer spike on twitch dies down, most streamers leave and play whatever is hot 3 months from now
---
My first toon was a NE Hunter (what else?) and I had a turtle (from Darkshore I believe) because my family has a couple of turtles. I was so mindblown when I realised you could tame almost every animal. I loved this turtle. I raided everything everything up to C‘thun with it, despite my guildies begging me to switch to something more useful.
---
Yep! I will be able to smash login servers for a WHOLE HOUR with my subscription =)  
---
Won't renew.
---
I always wonder when people find themselves agreeing with a practice that made Retail what is is, when they'll realize what they're saying.
---
I've twinked in retail since Vanilla. Recently, I found a way to continue BGing on my twink by transferring it to a legion account. I played about 5 battlegrounds before I unsubbed again, as it wasn't even fun without the twinks I used to face on a daily basis. 
---
Just because you don't think its a reason doesn't mean its a lie. Thats just letting your prejudice against someone who beat you who you feel doesn't deserve to interrupt your rational thought.
---
People too sensitive nowadays.
---
Lol what.
---
No, they don't. The only items that inflate in price are the super rare bus items for each bracket like the pendulum of doom or tigerstrike mantle.
---
You sound like complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
Vouch
---
i cant speak for anyone but myself, but i want it to be static after all the content is released.
---
See Mikey, upvote Mikey.
---
Poe que no las dos?
---
Only US? poor EU.
---
Everyone sucks at PVP until they don’t. Coming from Everquest I didn’t want to play on a PVP server so I rolled PVE. My human priest was 52 when WSG rolled out and I got absolutely smoked.  The low level didn’t help but I also didn’t know what the hell I was doing. 
---
I rerolled warrior on a PVP server and loved it so much I ended up getting Grand Marshal. 
---
You won’t get better at it unless you practice and you won’t find that practice on a PVE server.
---
The converse is that there are those people who find that to be a negative, not a positive, thing. I've done my time having to be hyper aware constantly, and I only realized afterwards just how much more stressed and tense I got playing that way.
---
There is, though, a possible solution for yourself if you like that feeling, but your friends want to play on a PVE server - just leave your PVP flag on. You'll have to remain just as aware, because even if there's a non-flagged member of the opposite faction nearby, they could always decide to just have a whack at you.
---
Yeah, I always found that argument weird. I never had any desire to to go back at max level and gank low levels, even if I was ganked a lot. Mostly saw ganking as a nuisance.
---
So, yes for certain on whelps. I'd just really hazard against grinding guides from p servers. There are a ton of differences. Like, the rocs in Tanaris, cast fireball. Most AOE guides had you killing em, but that is not a good call. 
---
Any Ogre with a 2 handed mace will stun/knock you down for 2 seconds. It will reset your swing timer, and kill you more often then you like.
---
It's just three names total, right? I hope the list comes out before then, so that I don't sit on the login screen and waffle for 20000 years.
---
In Retail there is ilvl scaling, so what he's saying is the opposite of Retail talk. Players with garbage gear can easily compete in Battlegrounds against people 50-100ilvls above them.
---
[In fact, theres also level scaling that allows level 110s to beat level 120s, just to ensure you don't have to be decked out/maxlevel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmzq9EkwRXk)
---
Unrelated to WoW note, construction/gardening will be taking a toll on your body that a lot of young guys don't notice and older guys say isn't preventable. Eat well (don't eat fast food and drink just coffee/energy drinks everyday), after work at least get some light exercise in (walking, jogging, pushups, situps, to warmup and for the love of fuck stretch/foam roll for at least 10 minutes afterwards), and don't lift with your back or spend time on your knees and you won't be physically destroyed and be in constant pain.
---
Having said that, Lok'tar ogar buddy.
---
And that is why Shamans, Druids and Paladins were taken to raids. They are all objectively worse healers than priests (aside from their individual niche), but bring useful buffs and support options.
---
The buffs just weren't useful enough to warrant a DPS spot, partially due to demographics. There are so many people that WANT to DPS compared to heal that its  hard to justify taking anyone but the best for DPS, when you might be lucky to have enough healers for the raid. And partially because DPS has a material impact on how fast things get killed. And speed is all important. When you raid a lot, you want to get it done fast. You're already spending more time on it than you probably should. So getting the raid done faster is always good. You use less consumables, you waste less time, and time is money, friend.
---
Even with a stealth team doing its job you have to keep SP gy and keep distracting pressure at the front of the bridge so the stealth team can do it's job. It's not rocket surgery, but it seems to be hard for pugs to manage consistently.
---
I get the misconception that PvP servers are toxic. However, having only played on a PvP server in Vanilla, there are benefits to them as well. 
---
#1. You create long lasting bonds within your faction. When you help out a fellow faction player or respond to someone’s need, people remember that. 
---
#2. PvP adds another dimension to the game. This is not for all people (clearly), but it’s an additional challenge. 
---
#3. Some players are looking for a good fight and gain your respect. 
---
To give an example, there was a good PvP rogue on my server and we would often cross each other. After a while, whenever we saw each other we would /wave or /bow. I also healed him a couple of times (polymorph) when I saw him low on HP and whenever we would have big battles (TMvSS), he would /sap or /kiss me just to let me know he was there to get the jump on me. 
---
While I completely understand your view, it’s not that bad. It’s a big world with plenty of grinds, quests, different areas within a zone and plenty of alternate zones to level, if you’re getting camped. And worse comes to worse, it’s always a good time to level an alt. 
---
Lok’Tar Ogar!
---
Allakhazam was superior too, I remember being able to look at a snapshot of my classic main up until sometime after 2010. It was basically an armory before we got the official armory, but only if you uploaded the info yourself via their addon.
---
Good thing I’m a casual worker earning $28/hr and have a boss that lets me choose my hours.
---
I’ve got a pretty good damn position to kick start my toons.
---
But sometimes even if you get decent you will just get fucked. If you wanna do a quest and there’s two or three Horde there who are also doing the quest, you will just get fucked endlessly. There’s nothing you can do. Alliance usually can’t be bothered to help each other out even if you ask. I hate that so much.
---
Link it then. Show the proof.
---
I managed 5 days /played on a private server duo with decent knowledge of which questing zones to do when. So if you practice on a private server and sleep 4 hours a day, you've got this
---
That's on random private servers,  we're talking about actually blizzard servers and people will go full on spergs  for world firsts, just look at what method did for atal dazar
---
Nonono. Denmark second.
---
No, it's a straight lie. 
---
Twinks :We only want to play with other twinks
---
Blizz: Ok, done.
---
Twinks: WTF blizz now we are only playing with other twinks, fix it!
---
What about this is hard for you?
---
Of course there's a massive difference.  
---
A twink might have 5 times the HP of the other class, that doesn't happen at 60.  
---
You lack everything but core spells, meaning the skill ceiling is incredibly low.  
---
Enchants, engineering, trinkets are tuned for a  different level range.  
---
Anecdotally I agree with OP, the people who ran twinks were always scrub PvErs.
---
Because they keep listening to the lowest common denominator who want their participation trophy for playing.
---
At 60 you'll get stomped if you are out geared by a premade. At lower brackets you'll get stomped by twink guilds. It's two sides of the same coin. People just don't like getting thwirbass handed to them when they casually play their shitty green gear leveling alt.  Its no  different when that same person  gets their ass handed to them by a PvP group going for r14.
---
I really want to.
---
Warrior/Healer in general leveling with be a breeze. If he's a good tank your lack of res as big of a deal as healing with bad tanks. Also consider as a druid you can also be the tank, druid tank has better threat and damage reduction in blues. Although druids are under represented they also are less desired. In MC/BWL healer comp will be something like 5 hpriest 5 hpala/rshamn and 2 druid. Also there will be a spriest spot as well with 16 debuffs limit.
---
I personally will be day one levelling my druid and later leveling my priest and gearing it from alt raids, I'll be leveling solo on my druid however and I have a guild/raid spot already. If you had considered making both, a druid can solo level much smoother than a priest, so you could level your priest with the warrior and you'd also have an easier time getting into a guild in phase 1 (especially if your a dwarf on alliance side). Your friend should also be able and willing to dps since in MC you only need 2 tanks for the most part but guilds will be looking to stack well geared competent warrior dps, if he's got tank gear and know how to that's ofc a boost as well. Druids become more indemand as more tanks are used since our HoTS cannot overlap so if there's only 2 tanks only 2 druids really get use of them. Druid healing starts to get a lot better with some of the BWL/ZG stuff and are wanted more from then onwards. Druid does have the benefit though of being able to be a qt nightelf and not be seen as sub-optimal like night elf priests. :)

You really ought to have someone else do it, otherwise there’s a bias. Those pieces of paper aren’t even identical.
---
Wtf is this bot.
---
it was so satisfying playing against a pally as a sham and just purging the living shit out of the them. same goes for locks lmao it was hilarious seeing a lock sacc their vw and then their shield dissapearing after 1gcd
---
3 names total per account with active game time yes.
---
Fucking American
---
No, don't tell them that. Reddit will get upset if they hear the truth.
---
fuck when is the last time a mage gave me a good amount of food, these days you have to ask and even then they give you like 1 stack, tight ass shit lol.
---
You nailed it . I could feel the paper differences . I can’t even trust myself .
---
I think you should let this subreddit decide. Create a poll.
---
Same here. Was elemental even back in Vanilla. Still Elemental today.
---
Going to go with Warlock because I don't like healing but still want to add support value.
---
&gt; no, when I can just ambush you for 180% of your max health.
---
Are you remembering BC/WOTLK rogues? 19 twink rogues were absolute monsters back then, but really nothing to worry about in Vanilla. Stealth speed + Stealth Detection (without the ability to grab the sub talent due to your level) made rogues pretty bad at 19. Hunters were another story.
---
If you saw the growth in power that twinks have gotten over the years, you wouldn't be so concerned about twinks.
---
Yeah thats absolute bis though 99% of twinks dont bother with AGM or fishing hat.
---
Although AGM is strait up BROKEN in low level pvp hahaha. As a flag carrier you can pop that bitch and just stroll down the middle of the feild no issues
---
My list is ready to go.
---
Roll tits. mdma is very distracting
---
If you have enough cocaïne it's probably possible
---
Dank cufflinks.
---
I’ve got a decent number of French cuffed shirts, they look baller with a full suit, the funkier cufflinks the better. Men’s high fashion is so stuffy, our socks and cufflinks are really all we get for style points.
---
Clipping an auto shot is when you use an ability that interrupts your swing timer. For example, if you have a 3 second swing, and you cast Aimed Shot 2.9 seconds after your last auto shot, you're going to delay your auto shot until the end of your Aimed Shot, which is about the time a *third* auto shot would have gone off if you hadn't clipped it. If you instead wait .1 seconds, you get a whole extra auto shot in, which is worth far more than casting Aimed Shot a little early.
---
&gt;Actual "proper setup" guilds broke up on Vael in vanilla, with all the MC gear they could muster. 
---
They weren't playing 1.12 classes, either.
---
Okay, first the title and now this comment... I have to ask, what’s with the extra spaces in your punctuation?
---
When I first played classic I was pve up until wotlk when I transferred from Bronzebeard to kazzak. The game had changed hugely in terms of wpvp by then but I noticed what a huge mistake I made wasting my time in pve. I had missed so much fun and will absolutely not be touching pve servers this time around.

---
\*\*What we're looking for...\*\*
---
* Driven players who strive to be the best
---
* Mature players who can get along
---
* Responsible players who show up and do their job​
---
All classes are currently open for recruitment, but certain ones are filling up faster than others.  Players will be expected to have reached lv 60 by mid-October and begun to work on gear, including adequate fire resistance. Players will also be expected to spec appropriately for raiding. Before our first raid, everyone must be attuned, as well as have appropriately leveled gear and consumables. 
---
\*\*What we're not looking for...\*\*
---
* Casual players who want to take it slow
---
* Disrespectful players who are rude to others and create drama
---
* Selfish players who want to be carried without contributing
---
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but if we want to be great as a whole we all have to strive to do our best and help each other out. If you want to take things slowly and just experience the nostalgia of walking around, there is a guild for you; if you want to pick fights or insult people from behind the safety of your computer screen, there is a guild for you; if you want to do the bare minimum and have others win you loot, there is a guild for you, but this guild is not it.   
---
 \*\*What we provide...\*\*
---
* Help levelling, questing, and partying directly after the launch of WoW Claissc
---
* Raids Wednesday &amp; Saturday (frequency will increase)
---
* Top level in-guild Blacksmith, Enchanter, Tailor, etc. with no tip required for fellow guild member
---
As a top-tier guild, we are here to help each other out and grow as a community. Those that put in work will be rewarded. 
---
\*\*Our Leadership\*\*  
---
Leaders are OG's from vanilla, and have experience in every raid that will be available in Classic. There is room for promotion within the guild for members who show promise, knowledge, integrity, and leadership.
---
\*\*Loot System\*\*  
---
Loot is distributed based on the Loot Council model.

Good. Makes for the most fun gaming experience for me!
---
Nah not fake just an early patch when rogues were broken
---
I think youre fostering drama and rage w/ this post
---
That’s actually not true. I played Alliance and despite being outnumbered we were actually a much closer knit community. 
---
I met one of my closest friends playing in STV. I got jumped by 2 rogues and he blew his Nature’s Swiftness to save me. We’ve kept in touch for the last 14 years even after we both quit WoW. That type of camaraderie is tough to find on PVE servers.
---
This person is hogging all the beta for themselves!
---
Holy crap it’s you. Just so you know I’m a big fan. You’re great. I really think you should stream.
---
And I know you said as far as you know but the conviction in your voice left some imagination room to play. You never said they aren’t you said you hadn’t talked to them and as far as you know...
---
That is life in PVP server.
---
If you dont like that kind of pvp, you should try PVE servers.

This thread might have convinced me to roll on a PvE server.
---
tank wake up plz
---
Blue set is better for PvP than a lot of epics, vanilla itemization is wonky you have to remember that.
---
Yea but heart of the wild gives a bigger mana pool for curse, poisons, and healing along with utility druids bring. Usually the tank isn't in the dps groups so the crit aura isn't that big of deal. Druids aren't going to be tanking that many adds outside of Garr or maybe Mojo Phase 1.
---
Lolol
---
PvP only brings out the second worst. What will bring out the worst are lag, login queues with 100000 hours waiting time and crashes during the first few days.
---
You will be able to harvest more salt from the forum on day one than you can from PvP victims in a whole month.
---
I'm really looking forward to watching the world burn, to then start playing one or two days later once things are fixed. :)
---
I agree, it’s been so long since I’ve been excited for a video game. See you out there!
---
Actually, Cosmos removed AutoLoot in 1.9 when the Shift+Click was added by blizzard. And by Removed I mean, it can't be added in since the function used doesn't exist in the API in 1.12.
---
Beta doesn’t even help. Feels meaningless since it all gets erased. 
---
Sorry if I’m rubbing salt in someone’s wound, just venting. 70 long days.
---
It's kinda sad that a fake video made by a warlock to get rogues nerfed 10+ years ago still has people using it as a faux argument today.
---
I queued up in 4 separate brackets when we were separated, first in WoD, then in BFA, and got 0 queues.
---
I never queued again. Why? Because why would I queue for something I expect to never pop?
---
Thats why no twinks queue. Wargames still happen weekly for a few brackets on live (59, 70, and 110). How do you explain that?
---
Maybe there are a variety of reasons that you're refusing to acknowledge because you are covering your ears yelling lies.
---
If twinks were, lets be generous, 25% of the population of WoW. Queue times in the 90 bracket are 15-35 minutes for exp-on players. What do you think the queue times for twinks would be in that bracket?
---
I'm sorry a twink hurt you.
---
It would be surprising if they didn't have backups of every patch ever
---
Poisons don't scale with any gear in Classic, which is why min/maxers don't use them at all in raids.
---
https://youtu.be/6-m2qW7SKMw
---
&gt;Mind you my opinion is largely colored by playing wotlk pservers/live. Classic is much more different I reckon due to reduced AoE cleave and slower threat generation.
---
Well, there you go honestly.
---
TBC and and beyond is entirely different from classic. 
---
Classic is a clusterfuck of fucky mobs, patrols, and runners, and ridiculous aggro chaining range.    
---
To add to the hurt, like you mention AoE threat generation is a bitch.   
---
Not only is it just hard in general, but a warrior is entirely dependent on getting hit to generate rage.   
---
I just cannot stress this enough, **a tank has to get hit to generate a useful amount of rage!**
---
This is what happens when DPS pulls in classic.   
---
* They probably don't know what the mobs do. They've never had to. The tank does, and knows. There's probably something to those mobs or just the area in general.
---
* The tank does not get the initial barrage of attacks against him, and has whatever rage he got from one autoattack and, maybe, a Charge/Berserker Rage. If the tank was in Defensive Stance switching is too much time and all the tank has is about 5 rage from said autoattack. That's it. 5-10 fucking rage. Not even enough for a Demo Shout.
---
Now if you're lucky, the moron who pulls is a half-decent mage or Hunter and you get yourself some sweet Frost Nova or Frost Trap. The former means delicious rage because rooted mobs attacks whoever are in range, and the frost trap at least means they'll be slow.
---
Yeah the warrior has taunt. That's one mob. It's not enough.
---
Do not fuck with tanks in classic.   
---
Seriously, just accept the fact that you are the tank's little bitch and accept your place. 
---
Ps. I won't be playing a tank.
---
Absolutely! Just take note on those character limits, you might have to break apart those paragraphs into more pieces when putting them into party chat!
---
Priest - mana cost for full raid buffs.

https://kotaku.com/blizzard-talks-world-of-warcraft-legacy-servers-and-mor-1781753136
---
this refers to what I am referring to - (the metadata) but there is another interview where a named blue spells it out explicity.  they had server code, but no metadata.
---
I will find my own comments from 2016 on this tonight, that will link the article.
---
This is the result of a Pserver bug and not relevant.
---
And how should we know which are streamer servers? Wait for two weeks until playing?
---
What stops streamers from rolling on different servers?
---
None of my go-to's are ever taken, so I'll be gucci either way xD
---
You're saying they dont use poisons at all huh?
---
Not even instant poisons when theres no room for deadly on the debuff chart
---
I want Naxx-tuned 5man dungeons, and no game has managed to scratch that itch. Something about the holy trinity and methodologically pulling dungeons (instead of speed-zerging) was really fun.
---
Same tbh. If a tank can't adapt to another player pulling, I'm more likely to think they're just bad, rather than some principled rebel making a statement about the implicit mob pulling responsibility. As a healer, I'm just going to pop a pot or CD and heal the dps and we'll be fine because 5 man content really isn't that big of a deal.
---
Nothing squashes an ego faster than when they realize *we don't need you.*
---
Well I guess nobody tried it back then... So you just have to try it. 😅
---
Then you'd be wrong. Kings+Might is miles better than a STR totem. Wisdom helps to a certain extent powershifting druids.
---
The one big totem there is on horde, Windfury, doesn't benefit at all ferals. The gap between feral tanks/regular warriors in threat generation is smaller because of that. And the gap in damage is bigger between horde ferals and the other melees that make use of WF.
---
Or it's just a lot easier to get BiS pvp gear on a level 29/39/49 whatever than it is at 60.
---
My fave brackets were 39 and 49 back in the day because you had most of your abilities and talents it was just a lot easier to gear.  You could get friends to help you and spend like may be 200-300 gold on enchants and be BiS pvp geared for that level.  Doing the same at 60 would require thousands of gold and hundreds of hours of farming.
---
&gt; Flying in TBC was completely limited to Outland
---
Having the new top-level zone completely separated from the rest of the world is one of the big flaws with TBC imo.
---
No need for a 70 to farm on Azeroth, so no seeing top-level players out roaming the world as you level (except gankers).
---
I never got a chance to try out this server sadly before it was shut down. I’m thankful that Nostalrius and other servers were made. We wouldn’t have Classic without them.
---
No reason not to try it.
---
I tried it with my warlock and it was so bad I just gave up. Without any instant cast tags I just couldn't loot anything in busy areas, and every area from lvl 10-20 is like this right now on PSs. The worst is boss quests, there are usually 2 groups just waiting at the spawn location trying to tag it first.
---
Nope. Horde have Windfury Totem and for everything else, there's Shadow Oil, which *does* scale with Spell Power and +Shadow Debuffs on the target. It even gets the bonus from a Warlock's Improved Shadow Bolt without consuming a charge.
---
Depends what you mean with experienced private server raiders. My guild pretty much never wiped ever in MC, a couple of big mistake wipes in BWL, a fair few wipes on Cthun and lots of wipes in naxx. And we were like top 5ish on the server.
---
Are you trolling? Why would Blizzard hiring Nostralius devs need to be a huge secret? We already know Classic is coming out. If blizz said in a panel that no Nostralius devs work there, and another Nostralius member said they don’t as far as he knows, it’s pretty safe to say they don’t work there. This isn’t MK Ultra lol. Why would it need to be such a closely guarded secret that they’re helping on the project?

Unpopular opinion, but the game "started going the wrong direction" with BC. I think standardizing the expansion model (handful of zones, few raids, add a Bg) etc is limiting for the game anyway. BC added some things which are nice in their own ways, but also subtly not so good. Arena is nice but flying really isn't. Making shattrah a new major hub, flying, and also making much of vanilla related content irrelevant.
---
Imo wow expansions should have buffered existing content instead of replacing it
---
So your claiming I don’t know jack yet you didnt know that this was in development long before the petition? Broooooo go away
---
I always thought the 20-29 bracket would be neat; arathi was a ton of fun the times i popped into it, even though i was never good at figuring out the strategy. And AV was always a distant wonder haha
---
I sure hope those aren't wedding rings
---
It’s a powerful spell. I struggle with skilled warrior / shaman combos especially if they’re orcs, it’s the only duo that I have to blow everything + pots and engi stuff to beat. People say paladins are broke but good shamans are so freaking powerful
---
That last point is mostly what I was arguing, in some matchups a player can kite/CC a better geared player to death without their gear making much of a difference outside of a higher hp pool.
---
Same, i want a static classic wow.
---
I get why people dislike it, because the disparity of twink vs non twink at low levels is huuuuuuuuuuge.  So if you aint twinking but you have an alt and u wanna do some WSG on the way up you're gonna get pissed because some dicksplat can 2 shot you with a character he has no intention of ever leveling further.
---
So I get it.... but I still love twinking personally.
---
You just said you had near infinite mana, very few skills and you were hard to kill.  
---
So..that sounds incredibly easy, thanks for proving OP correct.
---
classic was announced during good legion times tho
---
Lol you can’t even provide the proof. Piss off
---
I think that could be interesting and honestly very fun, but i would be worried about how that effects the meta game progression which is why im mainly against post content.
---
I bought [one of these](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LbkAmncUL._SL1500_.jpg) a bit ago so I'll be using it instead of my full keyboard. And I have [this mouse](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Gepr-sTpL._SL1500_.jpg) to compliment it. 
---
So the basic setup will be something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/oBGhqBe.png). All the blue ones will have shift-modified versions. Those white 0-9 keys on the right emulate the num-pad buttons. Those small white buttons with no label, I was thinking of using those for misc interface functions. Rep, skills, professions, etc.  F1-F12 will be for lesser-used stuff or out of combat things. 
---
Stuff like inventory, quest log, spellbook, map, etc. will be on the mouse buttons.
---
I'll be recreating [this ElvUI layout](https://i.imgur.com/ubSHUby.png).
---
Hoo boy, this subreddit is full of pvpers! :P
---
I posed a similar question yesterday, and I got mixed results, too. Once people hit the cap and get bored (or are bad at the game and get kicked out of groups), no-lifers are born and the lowbies are the ones who suffer at their corpse-camping shenanigans.
---
It's frustrating, especially when you only have a couple hours here and there to play the game. Travel time between some quests is already insane, and hours stacking up of /played time (or logged off waiting for someone to leave you alone time) just makes it worse.
---
Depending on how slowly you level and what your endgame goals are, you may decide PvP isn't for you.
---
Or maybe you really love WPvP, in which case...the slog will probably be worth it for you.
---
I talked it over with my husband last night and he decided to roll on a "care-bear" realm for Classic. He's lucky to have an hour a night to play, and if he logs in and gets camped it just ruins the fun for him. If he could get ahead of the pack he'd probably be fine, but he'll be lagging behind the others, that's for sure. I'm fine going PvE; my reaction time is slow due to a physical disability and I like farming/fishing/etc anyway.
---
In your case, OP, you may not be able to no-life it, but can you still get in a couple/three/four hours a night? If so, you'll be fine I think. People who hardly get to play (or hardly have the energy to play after work) should definitely do what's going to make the game more enjoyable to them, even if it's not what they'd do if they had more time to play.
---
I actually still very much agree with the "you think you, but you don't" 
---
Not because you can or can't like something, because who am I to tell you what you do or don't like.
---
But the why behind those feelings.
---
What is especially nauseating albeit hypocritical about the classic wow crowd is how you employ the exact same logic to why you like something, as those that apply it to why they think you don't like something. You make sweeping generalizations that the commonwealth of classic fans is unanimous in it's thought process, that you all like the same thing for the same reasons. That is demonstrably false.
---
I for one am only interested in PvP, and not because I think the PvP system is/was great. In fact I think it was very broken, and the decision to reward players years later according to that broken system is a grievance that even after a decade I can't let go. I did however, like the concept of glass canon specs. I had a LOT of fun with them.
---
Specs:
---
There are certain highly sought after talent points in any given tree. The deeper down the tree you go, the less variation is available. That being said the variation between those specs is negligible. Most people googled (as they still do) what the optimum spec was. I get it... you like to go against the grain, to be a rebel, to be that unique little butterfly, so your purposely allocate those few wiggle points "incorrectly" because it "works for you"... those variations have such a minuscule effect on performance it really isn't/wasn't worth the choice.
---
Lack of group finder encourages group play:
---
Already in beta we see game theory proving this false. The prisoner's dilemma provides the framework to why 2 individuals might not cooperate despite it being in their best interest to do so. The beta has shown people refusing to group and instead camping spawns hoping to be the first to tag a mob, and complete a quest. It would benefit everyone to simply create up to 5 man groups utilizing the people standing around to get more completed, and less likely to have the mob "stolen" from you for completion. But they AREN'T doing that.
---
The only people playing classic are those who truly want an original experience:
---
O rly? So then why does Blizzard feel the need to manufacture a faux development schedule in the form of phases? Why, if everyone playing is so eager for that "authentic" experience, would someone even consider skipping content. If classic is all about the "journey" wouldn't skipping content trivialize the experience? Why would someone willingly participate in this manner? Blizzard's own design directive laugh in the face of this bold faced lie.  
---
So again, "you think you do, but you don't" you may very much enjoy classic. I think if you really dug deep and had some serious self reflection... it wouldn't be for the reasons you continue to parrot.
---
You think you do, but you don't is honestly the most misunderstood and misrepresented comment anyone at Blizzard has ever made. There are glaring inconsistencies between players feedback and player behavior.
---
This account is prob going to be my character name.
---
Level 60 twinking was a thing too, because you could have an account which only had classic and so would stop gaining xp at 60.  But you could help gear it with just a few level 70 friends rushing it thru bwl or such.
---
Would it be so bad to have some EXP gained in BGs?
---
Im not doing an argumwnt dor big numbers. Im just saying the dos numbers have literally 1 digit more than in classic while you wanted to trim multiple digits, making the dps number significantely lower than in classic, which means that you think the numbers in vanilla are also abnormaly huge? I totally agree that the millions of dps in legion were too big but right now they are 5 digits instead of classics 4
---
Technically Imp Sanctity Aura wasn't added till TBC. You just put one point into the aura (which all Ret Palas do anyway to boost their own DPS) and go from there.
---
They did... Use archive.org to search the old EJ forums. Poisons didn't scale with gear in Vanilla and they won't in Classic.
---
And if you refuse to do that, it's also been tested with the 2-piece bonus from Wailing Caverns in the Beta. Doesn't work there either.
---
Then you haven't been part of a guild that was at all serious with raiding.  This happens everywhere in the mythic raiding scene today
---
Depends on the guild and stage of progression.   People throw around “easy” like you can just walk in an auto attack everything to death.  You can’t. You still need to know what you’re doing. You just don’t need to know very much - especially compared to retail encounters.  
---
Most organized guilds that have seen the content before will still wipe from time to time on specific bosses. Some bosses can literally just kill the tank with some unlucky parry strings and that’s a wipe - even in MC. 
---
Ony still wipes raids when enough people die to not moving to the right spot in time etc. 
---
The biggest difference is once the guild moves past a raid in terms of progression. In AQ gear, geared main tank - you’ll just start shredding bosses so wipes become less and less common. 
---
So although progression still definitely sees wipes - it filters out pretty quick.

Guldan, times change.
---
People do not understand your point, it’s unfortunately been a recurring theme since the announcement.
---
To even suggest that world buffs are an exploit is so far off its ridiculous.  I saw this video in my feed and didn’t watch it because I can jump to conclusions based on the title alone.  I know that’s frowned upon but tbh watching the vid seems like a waste of time.
---
Read my post.
---
I agree there were flaws with tbc, but it fixed a lot of the flaws of classic. Overall I think it was the best wow ever was.
---
No EU , thanks blizzard.
---
I don’t know, why would they?
---
Just because we don’t know doesn’t mean it can’t exist? 
---
Doesn’t anyone think it’s suspect that these two are gone and not even in touch with Nano ?
---
I kinda want to try to get a warrior alt up through rested XP. And I want to get Mining/Blacksmithing on them... which would not benefit me at all in any way but I likely won't raid much if at all so w/e. :D

It’s a good name go for it

Any respectable software development shop has a SCM and backup practices to ensure that pretty much any important line of code that was ever written can be found.
---
I work in this area, and it's called DevOPs.
---
My company has to maintain 2 years of products at client sites, so I need to maintain SCM, build machines, test servers, etc... for 2 years of product releases.
---
Although I dont have systems actively setup, I could dig into SCM and find our source code from 5 or 7, or even 20 years ago before I even was at the company. It might take some work to find the correct compiler settings, etc... but I have pretty much everything I need to start production on a 7 to 20 year old product all over again.

I cant imagine a reason I would need to so this, and it would suck to do, but it's possible and that's partially why my job exists.

Hunter was pretty fucking useful in raid, getting rid of enrage + pulling for the tanks + doing pet pulls on things like geddon and shaz in MC are just basic things hunters did all the time in my raids, we legit played like a ranger class in vanilla in most of my guilds. It was the mages who were always the snowflakes whining about making water and shit..
---
Hurry up I'm dying here
---
Back in wotlk it was not uncommon to have twink only bgs.
---
In that way there is much more even playing field when twinking than at max level. Ever played as fresh max level vs someone with full pvp gear (back then)?
---
Meh, a level 19 twink might have four times the stats of a level 19 leveler.  With just your core skills so little to no way to outplay each other.  
---
At 60 there is at least a chance of outplay.
---
They used a server backup. They didn't "happen to stumble upon" an old server. Not sure where you got the impression I said Blizzard, or anyone else, would "roll back current wow code" whatever that means.
---
And yes, playing WoW before expansions is the reason private servers exist. If blizzard offered legacy servers of their own, as they do now, the market for private servers would be extremely small.
---
I had a 39 druid twink with BiS except for AGM.  Had something like 6.5k hp in bear form.  Back in the day 39 was a great place to twink a druid because mounts were still level 40 so it was still a no-mount BG giving travelform a huge advantage over later brackets.
---
I actually logged him in on my retail account the other day and noticed he has some gear equipped which must have been changed to be higher level than 39 in the cata patch or something because like 2 pieces he has equipped come up as red with requirement of 40+ heh.
---
„strong“
---
Only thing went strong there is Hammond crashing that croatian e-car
---
Layering won't solve the described problem as I understand it.
---
Oh I agree 100%.
---
\&gt; There will be drama and rage 
---
This is my definition of fun
---
Are you retarded?
---
Runescape was like the 2nd most popular MMO.
---
In MoP I would que as Heals with my moonkin for normal heroics. I would end up Tanking, Healing, and Dpsing. I could carry 3 people easy. Kinda dumb how easy it was really. But this is ToT and SoO gear.
---
I assume that by a few years ago, you mean during Wrath or Cataclysm.
---
After that point, hitting 40 or 50 was a 3 hour endeavor at most.
---
If that is the case, I have to ask, was the something in the game that made you stop? or was it real life was more important? If it is the latter, I totally agree.
---
The only issue is going to be balancing the time investment in Classic WoW vs. Real Life in this world as it exists today.
---
Since it's been a number of years since you last played, and your lifestyle and priorities/responsibilities may have changed (probably hopefully anyway), then you will still have to combat that option.
---
I would say, if you want to enjoy the game, you will. If you want to enjoy the game as a raider, then you will want to make sure that you have the time to spare. The time investment in clearing raids is immense. I am not kidding. It's not like Wrath of the Lich King era of raiding. It's completely different.
---
In the end, I will try to see all of us on the servers when it goes live. I will be using Retail to make my gold to buy tokens so I can play Classic without "paying for classic", because yea... it's the way I want to play.
---
I loved my owl. I found better pets later that I’d use for raids, but that owl went with me everywhere else.
---
BfA must be doing worse than we thought if they're dangling this carrot in front of us.
---
That's complaining you dope.
---
Well yeah I'd do things differently now then back then, knowledge was harder to share and potato internet. But shockadin ain't ret.
---
Reddit is hard, minus 50 DKP for me. :D
---
I dont understand how you dont understand how people don’t understand what active means.
---
Whenever I group up with people who refuse to reply back I assume they don’t speak English
---
What makes ret better than ench? Totem utility seems very good especially if you twist windfury / tranquil air.
---
Worg should be horde, bloodelf should be alliance. The only reason it was not like this is because Korea needs a pretty race or they won't play it.
---
Not talking bout xp in bgs, talking about xp locks
---
See, for some of us Rogues, that pain you feel.. that "living hell" you experience... that frustration... it's what brings us the most joy in this game. I'm sorry you feel this way, but maybe PvP server isn't for you.
---
F. Did 4.5 years active. Would recommend playing classic instead.
---
Congratulations! I get married myself this Saturday! Here's to long, happy relationships friend
---
Not becoming a pay-to-win cash grab was also a huge plus that many servers eventually fall into.
---
So horde rogues use no poison on MH and Shadow Oil on offhand ?
---
I don't know. I feel like the PvP part is fine. It's a simple solution, you guys fight. Your allies are the problem. They're going to try and steal aggro from your mobs to reset them. They will follow you to the mining node and take that ore even when you've clearly got the first click in. They will drop an infernal by your flight master then banish it on repeat for multiple hours so everyone is stuck. Sometimes you'll randomly get level 1s threatening physical harm on you. I wish I could PvP everyone.
---
Didn't think I had to specify that but yes lol Rugby.
---
&gt; and got nothing in return.
---
Except for money.
---
I mean, you guys don't actually think that Nostalrius was doing this for free, do you? 
---
If something is free it means you're the product.
---
Something like BC Arena would be a lot of fun if you remove all the rewards and items, just keep the rating system for show-off (maybe there could be buy-in cost in gold and winner takes all).  
---
Actually you could probably organize these tournaments yourself without any classic+ patch :)
---
I used to not like soda, but he's calmed down a lot. Some people just got super upset about the "blacklist" thing and it was completely overblown.
---
Sounds like a shit show
---
I mean technically UBRS counts as a raid.
---
Well this is super disappointing.
---
I always ground under the bridge harpies from 51 - 55.
---
I hope so.
---
Major bummer.
---
BC definitely added some very damaging systems to the game, but at least the gameplay was still challenging.
---
I hated how BC looked visually (super ugly expansion), it added flying, Arena and Resilience killed any form of casual PvP, Dungeon layouts became tubes, gold inflated (everything gave more gold and they introduced daily chor... erm quests), elite quests became soloable (for a lot of classes anyways)...
---
The gameplay was spot on, though. The raids were pretty cool for the time (Karazhan was damn cool full stop), the villains were well known awesome characters, the attunement quests were cool, ... 
---
But yea I get you. BC did some things very wrong, it's still one of the best expansions imho.
---
The Classic WoW Experience is 150,000 % different so I applaud you on not taking BfA as an example of what Classic is like.
---
There are a lot of things in Classic that even going back to Wrath of the Lich King expansion, has added to the game for a Quality of Life enhancement. They don't exist in WoW Classic.
---
Grouping means you have to talk with your server. You don't queue up for something. It doesn't work that way. The closes you get, is using the meeting stones to summon a party member you have already grouped with to do a dungeon.
---
You will get to know your server more and more the longer you play on it. You will recognize names of players, and until they patch the battlegrounds (if it's not on launch) with the ranks and such, you will then learn to recognize your enemies in PvP :) Honestly one of the best features of the games was the Battlegrounds as far as a community vs. faction confrontation is concerned.
---
I am not going to bring in Southshore vs. Tarren Mill because it is its own beast.
---
Honestly, I would try it out. I personally will be using Retail to flip items on the AH to pay for my WoW Subscription the best I can. Even if it's every two months, it's half-price. I can make a token every 60 days easily by doing the absolute bare minimum of effort.
---
Everybody wants my candy.
---
Yup. I'm hoping on Classic we'll all be able to bond over our common love of the game while the toxic MLG mythic speedrun 360 noscope crowd will stay on BFA and leave us alone.
---
I’d assume most of the chaos was 2005 and 06, 04 was release and just keeping servers running through holidays. 
---
I wasn’t there, but based on everything I’ve read in The WoW Diary and heard from developers points to a bunch of guys who spent all their time updating the game not memorializing how the game was. I agree, and it seems to me like a best practice to Save As before everytime you push out a patch, but I don’t work in software or entertainment software where the drive for content updates is fevered.
---
The 19 bracket isn't the only bracket to twink at and is universally considered the worst both in balance and quality of gameplay. 29, 39 and 49 are much better with larger degrees of viability and less balance issues. The 19 twink bracket sucks, and its stupid expensive to twink because everyone does it.
---
crazy how the earth do that

---
Now are you talking about just hybrid SPECS or just hybrid classes?
---
Either way, there's going to be a lot of Druids.
---
Especially if you have a Paladin tanking. You're gonna need innervate constantly.
---
Subs fell off a cliff long before Legion though. Started in MoP and really took a turn in WoD before they stopped releasing the sub numbers.
---
I've had plenty of times where I was getting ganked while some dude was standing nearby on his mount not lifting a finger. I find Alliance usually doesn't give a shit and these cases you describe are rare exceptions.
---
Correct. But only if you get the Supreme Power flask, which you should since there is no melee flask. And it scales with other buffs too.
---
I played on Magtheridon US, what was your character's name? I dont remember any paladins getting rank 14, besides maybe one who played alongside a warrior, both were Dwarves and the warrior got Sulfuras first on server. I was on horde side guild Exiled
---
You assume you'll pull agro off a cat.  You won't if you're BM spec.
---
Which area will be the least populated? Mulgore?
---
Do you think healers are in more demand than even tanks?  If waiting 20 minutes for a healer is common I can only imagine how long the wait is for tanks.
---
You seem mad. Dude go away, no one wants you here with your lack luster opinions. Proof is littered all over this sub and google the moment you type it in. I’m not going to waste my time giving you a link just so that you can downvote it because you knew you were wrong and then not reply to the link. Good game buddy. Can’t wait to see you on classic.
---
Wait. How did the Dwarves "invaded" territory from a literally alien race? Didn't you get that backwards, chief?
---
You’re throwing around easily quite loosely here.   Keep in mind none of these ‘runs’ where people did it in 5 days played was not on a launch week.
---
I did, most of the things you suggested would effect the meta game, do you really think new set bonus' wouldnt change how certain classes choose to gear? not to mention it would change how slower guilds would progress into naxx if they have access to another new source of gear, aswell as changing the PVP meta.
---
I really dont think i need to explain why changing the ranking system would effect PVP player progression.
---
That's why you roll Horde
---
On private servers they do.
---
TBH a good Frost Mage is going to be making any instance run smoother. If I see the healers taking aggro of a mob I can freeze or kite them to stop it. 
---
Moreso on the BG side a good Mage will be easy to spot (Vurtne)
---
They are! lvl 40 beta toon here, also recommend for semi attentive Dad'ing. I have full on conversations with my kid, while occasionally right clickin on the next mob and refreshing Seal of Command!
---
You’re reading WAY too much into it. You even say “the cadence of his voice” when he typed out a message. The cadence you’re hearing is in your own head.
---
I can’t see how Blizzard not telling the community that they hired Nostralius devs would help in any way. The WoW Classic announcement dropped, if they were going to reveal that, they would have done it then. Just this thread alone shows there’s public interest in a Nostralius acquisition.
---
It was likely they got some cool shit at the meeting, then went their separate ways to avoid legal troubles. He probably hasn’t heard from them cause they need money, so they’re working elsewhere. He never said they’re not in touch, he said “as far as he knows, they don’t work there.”
---
You keep believing what you want. I hear if you kiss frogs they turn into princes too, maybe you should do that cause just cause we know it doesn’t work half the time who says it won’t when you try am I right?
---
Will of arlokk from zg + 25spirit is huge for this, one of the key differences between mages.

It's not the actual addon itself, it's the parent page it's on. I know I would skim right past that if I were actually looking for results.

\#No #NoChanges
---
Lol k cry more. You’re the mad one, keep it up with the autistic preaching.
---
You can clear a raid with all warrior dps.
---
Oh yeah how can I forget the ever popular world buffed level 63 raiding meta, a staple of BC.
---
As a Ret Paladin the boomerang is a very important item for ranged engagement!
---
Warrior is a hybrid class btw
---
If you are going for more hardcore raiding priest is the better choice.  An optimal raid group is going to have a small number of druids.  If you manage to get in, then it's easy to get geared though.
---
Ok, So im guessing when you said pro you meant prostitute? Only a streetwalker would take this advice.
---
Ok. So question:  
---
If you'd take the class and spec you got glad with and did it as a twink instead, which would be mechanically harder to play?  
---
I got glad throughout S1-S4 as a resto shaman, can't imagine how utterly boring twinking a shaman would be. Lack of anything but core skills, barely any talents. All macro, no micro.
---
No one but you and a minority use it that way. Like, I hate using dictionary definitions to define words since that is just one group of people's opinion. But you'll find the same definition in both 'official' dictionaries and open sourced dictionaries. They're insults plain and simple. Its why Barack Obama was called an elitist by his detractors and not his supporters, because its an insult.
---
1-10 is a pretty fast trip for most classes and starter zones from my experience with beta. This is, of course, by design. The idea is to get you hooked with rapid character improvements and getting stuff done. 
---
It drops down significantly at around level 13 or so.
---
R1 Frostbolt kite that fool. Poly heals and CoC the War..
---
Agreed, but if we get a Classic+ expansion, I hope they learn that lesson and keep everything grounded on Azeroth.
---
I subbed 2 days ago just to scratch that itch. Got zandalari troll unlocked and I'm leveling a shaman. It's fun to pass a few hours if you're bored. If you wanna sub for the beta do it! I'm glad I did. You're gonna be subbing in 2 months anyways. But it's all up to you
---
Troll is master Horde race.
---
The record was made on a launch week, for that server. And we also didn’t have layering back then and servers were much more unstable.
---
Is it easy for your average FortNite player? No, but neither is running a marathon. But starting from zero preparation for either goal, getting to 60 in 5 days played is much easier than running a marathon.
---
Oh 100% my max level character would be mechanically more difficult to play. Unfortunately the premise of the argument is that twink players are not mechanically skilled.
---
The currency version didn't remove ranks afaik, but made them cosmetic only? I didnt play much at that time, took a stroll for old days sake then quit till tbc was out
---
It is important to manage expectations here, I think.
---
The last stress test they did I had to wait in line, and then was unable to actually get into the game. 
---
After that the servers crashed and were unresponsive for the rest of the day. 
---
So be super careful of managing your expectations if you're planning to get a sub just for this weekend.
---
Squaresoft lost Final Fantasy 8.
---
And yet it has never reached even 5% of WoW numbers in the history of the games existing together.
---
Oops I meant molten-wow they were like the biggest server for a long time
---
Commenting to know as well these are great
---
Twitch.tv/nanonost :)
---
Ooooo. Ice come back. My internet feelings are so hurt. You made a statement so I corrected it because you literally know nothing and are getting upvoted for nothing.. keep replying. I can do this all night buddy.
---
Brings me right to the same page linked in OP  
---
/shrug
---
The launch week you’re referring to was just for that one random server, and not for a completely new vanilla.  The amount of people live when Joanna was doing his run was like 100 people.  I clipped this once when talking to someone about it,  just go back and look at the footage of him leveling from 1-20 and you can literally count how many people on online.
---
That’s not even going to be remotely similar to an ACTUAL full fresh launch.  Even with layering
---
*Thank you*. If I could upvote more than once I would. Not enough people seem to comprehend the implication of "minor" buffs and tweaks to some classes. Any balance tweak has a ripple effect that can horribly mar another part of the game. 
---
Buffing Ret Pallies to be competitive for PvE turns them from an annoyance to a Raid Boss in PvP. Buffing Fury Warriors to be as good as Arms for PvP, would make them even better or more flexible in PvE. And I don't wanna hear anything about balancing PvE and PvP separately. That's one of the worst parts of Retail for me, it ruins any illusion of cohesion that an RPG world has when you have completely different capabilities and damage based on whether you're inside a BG or not.
---
I would love if they figured out a way of making outlands with no flying, but I don't know how they would implement that. A lot of the content was only accessible at 70 because of flying.
---
Kek.
---
How many of us paid more than that just for the Blizzcon demo?
---
Mmm, I don't care, I'm doing quests and reading the text, sue me.
---
Definitely 
---
If we had the theory crafters we have now back then
---
Everyone would take ret paladins
---
"A twink might have 5 times the HP of the other class, that doesn't happen at 60."
---
More like 1.5 to 2 times HP. How much more HP does a buffed raid tank have compared to a fresh 60?
---
"You lack everything but core spells, meaning the skill ceiling is incredibly low." Maybe at 19. Not at 39, 49 or 59
---
"Enchants, engineering, trinkets are tuned for a different level range"
---
Fresh 60's won't have enchants at all.
---
"Anecdotally I agree with OP, the people who ran twinks were always scrub PvErs."
---
Empirically, after running numerous twink guilds, we saw a normal cross section of wow players, from elite gladiator level players, hard core raiders, to newbs, scrubs and trash
---
Yeah that's true, but they didn't mention PvP at all? Also since when does Pally not have 2 good PvP specs? Holy is probably the best healer...
---
This guy almost convinced me to play a ret paladin.. almost
---
"Said it a few times and will say it again, with engineering and coming to raids with a plethora of consumables, Ret does fine. It isn’t outstanding in any capacity. If you take a full raid of 100% tried and true knowledgeable min/maxers, Ret will sit below most of the DPS. But they offer unique utility and as stated above, can be relied on to show up.
---
Part of being a hybrid is being versatile. When you’re trying to progress in a raid, sometimes you need to bite the bullet and heal. Sometimes you need a little more DPS. Sometimes having a clutch Lay on Hands or a BoP or an extra body to dispel can be helpful. Ret fills all of these roles. If you are a raiding Ret Paladin, you are prepared for everything.
---
Now, the fun part. Not every guild is cutting edge or conquering content at a server-first pace. In an ideal setting, you have every Fury Warrior and every Rogue in nearly identical gear, completely BiS-geared, fully world-buffed, with hundreds of gold in consumables ready. This is almost never the case.
---
Being a guy who takes himself seriously, but not so seriously, a Ret can show up and take 2-handers that might go to waste. They can help heal when a Paladin has to stay late for work or has to take care of his kids. It is a luxury to be a Ret, so should you get the opportunity, you should try hard. Don’t be a Ret that shows up in PvP and Valor gear and expect the first Bonereavers. Be the Ret that rallies the raid. Be a benchmark for the lowest DPS. If there are Rogues and Hunters and Mages below you in DPS, those guys are probably playing wrong. Ret provides a floor for your raid DPS. Sometimes, in rare occasions, Ret might get an insane string of procs and actually top the DPS during trash. Being in the middle to the top of a total raid damage done does help with times. Not every player in a casual guild tries hard. This is where a good Ret will be ahead. A great Ret might actually top the meter on a fight like Nefarian where other classes are constantly disadvantaged by class calls. Not to mention the fun on Nefarian when the dragonkin adds respawn as undead. Launching a salvo of holy wrath and consecrate with a goblin sapper generally spiked my DPS to the \~500 range, pulling ahead of AQ40-geared Rogues and Warriors. People laughed. This was a win/win. Not only did I totally contribute to a kill, I eased the dramas and gave people something to smile about.
---
When you reach Naxxramas and still get to continue as Ret, you are relatively “decent”. You might put the raid at a disadvantage on a fight like Patchwerk, so you just take a seat and let a Rogue fill in. Yeah, it sucks. You are playing Ret though. You shouldn’t take it as an insult to your manhood. Just be above it. Then when you get to Noth, you’re actually wanted. Because you burst undead adds very fast. Or Gothik. It’s nice to get the nod and watch a Hunter take a seat because you’ll be more beneficial.
---
And perhaps the best part of being a Ret? Sulfuras.
---
Every guild needs a banner carrier. Sometimes Warriors will get the call for it. But if you’re a good dude who helps farm consumables, PvPs a lot, brings repair bots, and generally plays hard to win, your odds of getting Sulfuras are pretty good. I’ve gotten it twice as such, so this is just my personal opinion and personal experience.
---
If you suck it up, don’t complain, and play to win, you’re an asset to any raid, even as Ret.
---
But that’s not exactly what you’re asking is it?
---
Viable yes. Meta or necessary? Not at all.
---
If you’re going to be in a guild with 20 guys who are ranking to 14, and whose goal it is to speed clear MC in 20 minutes, you are going to have a hard time being Ret. You’ll watch their Holy Paladins rank to 12+ with them and wield that beautiful claymore and they will be drenched with tier.
---
But if you’re in a guild of good souls, who just need someone to make them laugh, and who keeps the drama in check by memeing, and surprisingly does well on certain fights? Well, you’ll get your full T2.5, maybe a Dark Edge of Insanity, and you’ll be a legend.
---
Take it all with a grain of salt, and don’t let anyone tell you what you can’t do."

&gt; test characters on a private server
---
Given some things seen on Beta this may be extremely unrepresentative.
---
Shiiiit.
---
Maybe I should start my Tauren Warrior first.
---
The bosses still hit hard and your characters still whittle away at them.
---
The fights however aren't very mechanically challenging compared to what most players are used to over the past 15+ years.
---
Getting past the zerg isn’t really that difficult and can be practiced and perfected on Pservers. They’re full of people right now and are preparing another fresh launch soon, which will be very valuable for testing.
---
Well this is great for you because they are making your perfect server right now. Why should those of us that want future servers with expansions that stay true to the classic model be left out?
---
Blizzard is going to give you guys a classic server if they do future expansions. They have already stated that in one of the interviews I think.
---
Maybe it's because they just wanted to be an epic paladin, like Uther? Not a great reason, but there's gotta be a reason I suppose.
---
What's this ancient thing called a timestamps and a screenshot?
---
My understanding is that layers will be server sized and therefore won't help with this at all.
---
What the hell? Lack of gear you are nuts. Name one class that has better gear options than you.
---
What's it matter?
---
But code isn't the only thing. There are also databases of older formats, files saved in formats that is not 100 convertible to modern, hardware that no longer exists, software with previously found security vulnerabilities, software and libraries that no longer developed and not compatible with modern systems, etc
---
Time to roll Horde then!
---
I mean, I don't really have a strong opinion on how the devs should treat this, but many of the things you mention are specifically addressed in the video posted above, and you understate a lot of the negative aspects (notably, just how big of a damage buff can be gotten from the buffs). I also don't believe that class parity enters this guy's discussion at all. He more or less states that they're unfun, time-consuming, and make already fairly easy content trivial. His final point, which, to me at least, is the most compelling, is that most of the world buffs were in fact removed from raiding very early into TBC, and, he argues, it only didn't happen sooner because very few people were using them before nax, and by nax the devs had moved on to TBC content. It seems to me that it's a similar situation to the Dire Maul farm in that it wasn't prominently used in Blizzard Vanilla, but is widely used today. It definitely seems that it is unclear whether it would have been patched had Blizzard not released TBC before patching it, and I definitely think it's worth having some discussion about whether or not the limitations on world buffs present in TBC and Wrath should be included in Classic.
---
Classic WoW will be overwhelmingly more popular than retail for the first few months.
---
After those initial months - I personally believe they’ll settle to about the same - with classic being slightly under the population of retail.
---
I’d say majority of classic player base will be returning or former players.
---
Most of whom just want a taste of nostalgia but don’t want to dive deep.
---
Retail will certainly be split quite decisively.
---
But who cares.
---
Jokes on you, I'll just leeeroy
---
if you mean releasing TBC and Wrath i am 100% with you i would love that aswell, im more refering to post naxx content, TBC would be my dream.
---
Can confirm. I've worked at more than one game studio. It's pretty standard to have version control at these places, keeping versions of every commit ever made. Typically it was Perforce, but Git is also used. Blizzard had version control running all the way back to 1997 for the code, and a few years after for the art too. They we're lucky to find an old folder with 1.12 art as well, so then they had all the pieces.
---
I think I understand the logic now. You've been writing the list, and the process itself have inspired you to make a definite decision. All the pros and cons you've written were intuitively weighted and - here's the clear solution.
---
Fair enough then :) I had fun playing a warlock (albeit gnome) on a private server. Even one-button raid rotation isn't a complete con - it's actually nice and chill (and only sometimes boring).
---
Hard to be lazy when you press 3 buttons once every 30 sec...
---
Might be on hot tomorrow.  You can’t predict the future!

You either accidentally put this in the wrong spot or misunderstood the instructions fyi

Or

Hunter: half my bag space is a quiver and pet food.
---
If the Gods are on your side, WF will be amazing at every stage of the game.
---
I really enjoy the slow pace of arathi basin and wsg without a mount.
---
Being good at max level pvp means you had the time to devote to getting gear. Skill doesnt play that big of a factor it's an mmorpg with pretty simple combat.
---
Get off your high horse
---
Do you see yourself grinding Naxx for a year? Two years?
---
Well this is good news, I wasn't expecting to get into the beta at all but a stress test is better than nothing.
---
Haven't played for a long time but I can compare the differences between retail and classic now.
---
Warlock is my class of choice.
---
1) Shards do kind of suck from a utility perspective, but are awesome from a flavor perspective.  I think if they just let them stack to, say, 5 or 10, then they wouldn't be much of a pain point.
---
2) No threat reduction.  This means we are restricted by how good out tank is.  Well, all dps are restricted in that manner, but Warlocks more so.
---
3) The debuff limit.  Unless you are one of the lucky SM locks for the raid, you don't get a debuff slot except for your assigned curse.
---
4) No +Hit on our main spell school (Destruction) for raids.  Affliction gets +Hit through the Suppression talent, but that only really helps our curses due to point 3.
---
Even with all of those downsides, I am still rolling a lock since they are fucking awesome.
---
Its gonna be so easy it won't even matter regardless
---
&gt; I honestly think as long as you bring something to the table, either shaman totems or paladin blessings or druid innervate, then bring your best man.
---
That was the goal with Vanilla, but the game literally was not designed to make that feasible. Most hybrid dps classes like Ret Paladins did less damage than a pure dps class. So on damage alone, they were typically not worth bringing. 
---
And of course, as you say, paladin's can bring blessings so you bring a ret paladin for that, right?
---
Again, not really. Most of the Paladin Blessings that matter are Wisdom, Might, and Kings and all three are easy to get. If you had three holy paladins, you could easily have all three buffs covered. The same can be said for Resto Shamans as well. 
---
Even things like Leader of the Pack, for Feral Druids were not typically good enough to warrant a place in the raid. Or if it did, it wouldn't usually be worth taking more than one. 
---
Hybrid classes can be fun, but playing one in Classic has plenty of drawbacks to it.
---
I've been thinking about it a lot, honestly I think it will be better for me to not play beta to avoid any sort of burnout on the 1-60 warrior grind. If I do get in I might try something like a shaman because ive never played them before but I've been thinking about resubbing aside from the beta just to go and do mount runs or something again, but I think about classic everyday and I feel, the feeling of joy logging into classic will be much greater if I put off my urge to resub

I'm sure they had a source repo, db backups, archives of art assets, and so on.
---
What they probably didn't have was a copy of the server os, db server, and every external and internal library dependency. From 2003 to today we had a shift from 32 bit to 64 bit. Plus, many people didn't "vendor" their depencies in the first place, because it wasn't standard practice and no one knew they needed to do it until they were bit by it.
---
None of these are insoluble problems, but there is a cost with making very old software work and Activision wasn't gonna pay that cost without the possibility of payoff.
---
This is such a good comment. I hadn't really thought of it this way! Back in the day I'd hang out in Darkshore and just fish early in the morning. I had to leave for work at 5:30am and I'd spend about half an hour in the dark fishing under the stars before I left. It was so nice and calm.
---
Low level characters shouldn't be spending gold on high end shit anyway, if they're planning to level a character normally they'll find something better in a few levels.
---
Joanas guides aren't even good anyway. The versatility of your addon is more valuable.
---
Basically he's upset about pvp on a pvp server because, he doesn't get to control it. Which of course is the entire point.
---
will there be monster energy drinks catered?
---
Stop referring to private servers it going to make you seem like you don’t know what you’re talking about. 
---
Private servers added things like dynamic respawns which allowed you to literally just spam one gathering quest item and it would respawn literally immediately.  Mobs that would spawn the moment they died.  It’s silly to think that it will even be remotely similar dude lol.  
---
https://youtu.be/jTSyexUNN9E
---
At 12:55 it shows how many people were online during this event.  I’m on my phone right now but to me it seems like it says 49 or 69.  You’re going to for sure be seeing way more than that on your layer alone lol.  So don’t compare it to joanas run either.
---
Pretty sure they did this on purpose, putting everyone’s account into a different bucket and then forcing different things on them. I had zero problems on stress test days, but others could barely play.
---
Yea I loved TBC as well, and also think it was the greatest era. Blizzards biggest mistakes were screwing up the talents. cross realm crap, and flying mounts. I think if they avoid these and don't do stupid changes that piss off the population than everything will work out.
---
for sure yes, worst case i would just start the journey over again as a different class.
---
Depends how you set the rules. If it was only pally/druid tanks, and only non rogue/warrior/mage/lock dps - that sounds pretty fun. It would probably be quite difficult to do AQ/Naxx like that.
---
Let me provide a counter argument: doing classic+ is the safest route for Blizzard. Why? RuneScape is proven model that is shown to be successful. Meanwhile, we all know where TBC and WotLK led us. It would be ridiculous to do the same mistakes twice.
---
5 things Big Mood doesn't want you to know
---
Christ 71 days before I have to do my best man speech 😒
---
It would need a complete rewrite though. DrDamage is also... old. And the newer version are just absurdly different in terms of game mechanics.  
---
For that reason I started working on a new addon like those, because I just don't feel like porting TBC DrDamage, or even TC, to the new API, and I don't like the code of those AT ALL. It's going pretty slow though, not having beta and the next stress test being US only certainly doesn't help.
---
It really was the perfect time since Return of the King came out right around when WoW did.
---
Very well done. For The Horde!

Runescape’s more popular than BFA

Hehe sex 8-)

Is it enough to pay a sub for a starter US acc to get into the stress-test?

Yes you don't need a sub to get into this stress test it seems. My second account that I haven't played in a few years got in.

**\*\*Midnighters \[H\]\*\*|NA-PvP|Wed/Thur| 9:30 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. PST| Semi-Hardcore**
---
Raid times:
---
Wed/Thur 9:30 p.m. - 12 a.m. PST
---
Tue a possible 3rd day in Phase 4 with the release of 20 man content.
---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message.
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.
---
Contact Funnyman (Discord: Funnyman#4802) Or, you can head to [https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters](https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters)and apply!
---
Nothing, if you are in the type of guild that would care. Ret and Enh are equally garbage. I don't have a problem with them but, I don't want them in my raiding guild because I get bored if the raid takes to long. So for me I want everyone main spec so we can be in and out. 
---
What I don't get are the casual guilds that care. I mean your already taking 3.5 hours to do MC. Whats a Enh or Ret gonna do to that? Make it 3.6 hours?
---
Did you make this video?
---
Actually you’re wrong. On many private servers there’s a timer on quest items, on the Classic Beta, they respawn instantly. Named mobs also respawn much faster on the Classic Beta. And many people have been tweaking their servers based on Beta experiences to make them more optimal testing grounds.
---
I wonder if you knew about Spelladins the entire time it took you to write this.
---
LF NA, AllIance, PvP REALM,LATE NIGHT RAIDS (10pm est or later start, would be happy to join a west coast guild

Holy Paladin.  Looking to grind ranks and clear naxx.
---
Looking for a guild who’s got people interested in running premade PVP when they’re not raiding.
---
Same, with a boomkin.
---
I had a r12 or so hunter. I will be rolling hunter first to take all the loot, err farm mara/dm but will be rolling either a rogue or druid as main. I like to pvp.
---
Nice come back*** lol ice. Prolly need some ice too for that butt hurt going on.

You don't need to have a sub to get invited as far as I know my account got invited without being subbed.

You think you’re right, but you aren’t. 
---
I’ve been playing classic in various capacities for almost 10 years in addition to 2005 +2006.  This isn’t some kind of badge of honor for me.  It’s a reflection of just how much I enjoy Classic WoW compared to retail.  I liked TBC and WotLK too.  But no matter how you look at it, you would just be dead wrong to tell me that I think I want Classic servers but actually don’t.  For nearly every “typical” reason espoused by others and then some.
---
Whatever vitriol you hold against people who have been asking for this for years, I’d only counter with the question of why you care at all that people are getting what they want.  Many will inevitably wash out and realize they hate it.  I guarantee it.  But many won’t.  10 years later, I still haven’t.
---
I would pay to have my vanilla character transferred to a classic servers once they hit later phases. He needs to be free from BFA.
---
It's all good. As long as we have a smooth launch. Just thought it would cool to share.
---
I'm single, 31 yo, and am lucky. I got 18 days payed holidays. So my plan is to lvl my main, and lvl my alt, whenever no guild mate is online to do instances for pre-raid gear. 
---
I want to have my hunter (herb / alchi) hit lvl 60, when Zul Gurub gets released.
---
I'm pretty sure I "outplayed" people way worse in raid gear than I ever did with a twink. Like I don't think I ever killed a guy so fast that I was confused where he went and level 19.
---
Also, this time around, raiding is sadly not gonna happen.
---
@Ernaud Agree entirely brother.  
---
One thing people also fail to mention is that Night elf starts with a lot more agility at level 1, I believe it's 7 extra. This is actually a really big difference from 1 to 10
---
Try less undead aura
---
You just picked Tauren Warlock...
---
I mainly heal because im lazy but I have often taken queue from the idle tank watching his over eager comrade die.  I'd have your back and let the backseat driver handle his own shit.
---
At this point it's a shame there isn't a private megaserver, at least it won't have layering.
---
I think I read somewhere that bis enhancement was 450 dps.
---
You say that as if 60 pvp is balanced. Also, maybe they're bored with 60 PvP and want a different meta?
---
The issue with Cata dungeons was that Blizzard had a really hard time nailing damage done to the group vs healing expectations. 
---
Basically you walk in and the healer is constantly on edge and having to fight the health bar, even with the tank doing the required tank rotations to stay alive. Damage spikes happened way too often on content that shouldn't have had it. It doesn't make for an overall fun experience for anyone.
---
They didn't use fury tank that's probably why.
---
Rogues are solid levelers, just have a good slow mace or sword.
---
You haven't seen shit yet. Make best friends with a druid, you're going to need his innervate.
---
I never hit the level cap and just twinked.  It was so fun I never wanted to try anything else.  Never really got BIS though.
---
I wish I could take time off... but I'll be going to graduate school the same week classic launches. It's pretty much the worst timing possible.

---
I don’t understand how you don’t understand that I don’t understand how people don’t understand what active means
---
Exactly my point! I'm glad we agree.
---
I wouldn't downvote you for pointing out that Paladins can not tank high end content the way a warrior can. I would downvote you for suggesting they should be able to.
---
1: no there isn’t I will provide you a video if you really want proven wrong that badly. 
---
2: no they most certainly do not.  Provide a link please of this happening. 
---
3: LOL most certainly not named mobs take WAY longer.  On every private server launch in recent times they turned up the respawn rates to 11 stuff took no time at all to respawn, I’m talking like 20 seconds on named mobs and such. 
---
4: none of them.  Literally none of them have been tweaking there servers.  Look man I’m a die hard private server player.  Been playing them for quite some time right now.  Based on what you have said in this post here confirms you have NO idea what you’re talking about.  For future reference stay away from conversations you aren’t informed on, at the very least don’t just straight up make shit up about them LOL
---
Your argument is that I proved I'm bad at endgame PvP because my twink was hard to kill? What logic train are you riding on?
---
I’ll be there !
---
I'd keep a hearthstone in your pocket in your suit pocket as a Plan B.
---
So are priests.
---
I think most people's enjoyment of PvP is tied to how well they do, and that's obviously gear dependent in WoW.
---
If this was accurate you'd be fishing, alongside your enemies too.
---
I like this advice. It's a good compromise. Even better if a friend is a rogue and you can play the dumb innocent target walking innocently along...
---
Now that you mention it, though, I think there's something to be said about the type of work you do IRL. If you have a fairly dull job that doesn't involve interacting with other people too much, or a lot of split-second decision-making, you might really want the stimulation that wpvp provides. The people who stare at numbers or programming code all day might be kind of desperate for something to feed their internal itch for Satisfaction.
---
If you have a busy/demanding/stressful job where you're already hyper-aware of everything around you all day (construction management for instance, human resources, or even soul sucking retail work) and you have to deal with real life PVP (annoyed/angry customers, deadlines, giving people bad news)...it's easy to imagine why people would choose a pve realm. They spend all day every day doing WPVP in real life and don't want to spend fifteen bucks a month to have to watch over their shoulder the way they do their work phone.
---
I always play with Gryts as my name, was confused when I saw the Grits example.
---
If you aim the server first MC clear you could wipe because of low gear/level and rushing. Otherwise if everyone has prebis and a competent raidleader MC is a piece of cake. You could wipe on your first try of Ragnaros still because your tank lack FR and your MT2 is not fast enought. Tbh i wiped a lot more on onyxia because we attempted it with 20-25 mens.
---
I remember we only wiped on Chrommagus on my pserver because timelapse bugged the boss and he would go threw the wall catching a healer and reset his threat. Nefarian was really easy when you are well prepared for your 1st run (holy water/sapper charge)
---
In AQ we wiped a few time on twins because the boss was hitting really hard and one of our warlock had trouble getting aggro (skill issue). We wiped like 7 times on Cthun before killing it.
---
As my pserver guild suffered attrition (people started to leave and there was a lack of good recruit) after Nefarian, i can tell that a lot of classic guild will have an hard time in AQ. We started taking really average players, we lowered our standard to fill spots (200 dps is better than 0 dps...) and the game became a lot harder and we struggle a lot in AQ and Naxx after this. 
---
My final advice, don't try to be an average good guild on your server (top 5-7) go for top 3, we tried and it doesn't work. Classic will bleed players after 6 months, at first your guild will feed on lower guild which will disband weeks after weeks because of a lack of raider and it will be ok for you. Until you become the worst guild of your server, and it's your turn to stuggle to get 40 players, then to fill raid spot you'll take anyone and it's hell, dealing with bad players is the worth experience i got in wow.
---
All the cool mounts they added to the game over the years is the thing I will miss about playing classic over retail. I have so many cool mounts on my retail account that did feel pretty rewarding to grind and get. I love the cloud serpents from Pandaria. Part of me is sad all the awesome hard work put into the art and models of modern expansions won't be seen (by me at least) anymore. I mean I can still play retail but I doubt I'd have the motivation to. Maybe after a while in classic it'd be a fresh change to play a bit of retail just every now and then. I doubt I'll ever play it seriously anymore though, just casually. The modern game never feels like it respects my time enough to play it seriously.
---
Like the other guy said, that's just a good player. "Tryhard" is a pejorative. The term is ironic. That's just how the word is used by the majority of people who use it. I'm not having a debate over whether it's a good or useful term. I'm just telling you what it means. If you keep using it thinking you're using it in a positive way a lot of people are going to misunderstand you.
---
Honestly I'm not sure. It could go either way. I'm inclined to think that more people are going to play warrior than priest and most druids (myself included) will prefer tanking to healing while leveling since feral is the standard leveling spec.
---
He was probably on a dead server or very late in classic, I remember how competitive pvp was early on vs not so as good players later, partly because u can get bettrr pvp gear at bwl onwards obviously. What a shit system it was, no one really enjoyed it and I helped my friend with his rank 14 during AQ 40, logged on when he was sleeping at the keyboard in internet cafe mostly because I mained a druid and they couldnt even kill a critter, warriors were fun back then even with his Arcanite Reaper they could do massive crits
---
Time is a big one... When you only get \[x\] hours a day/week to play, it'd feel bad to spend half or more of that time dead/camped/pvping unless you're really into it.
---
https://i.imgur.com/M0LRo7E.png this is not the same page linked in the OP. If it's different for you, you're getting different customized results than I am.
---
Spawn into dungeon, everyone is on half health, buff everyone and heal them back to full, sit down to drink as I'm now on 300 mana, look up and the tanks charged in like a maniac and pulled 6 groups of mobs, we wipe and I get vote kicked. 10/10 love private servers
---
I was glad s3 and s4 and i had a 19 and 29 twink
---
Change my mind
---
And how is that? ive been posting this here in every monday lfg :)
---
The goal here was to make it so that healers of any class could do whatever role the group needed them to do. 
---
For example, Classic WoW Holy Paladin's are not going to be good at healing a group. They only get two spells and they are all single target. So lot's of raid damage isn't going to be cleaned up efficiently or quickly by a Holy Paladin. They literally lack the abilities to get it done compared to other classes. 
---
Holy Paladins were really good tank healers and were touted as such for most of Classic and TBC. 
---
So while classes got spells that allowed them to fulfill new roles, they were still able to largely retain what made them special. 
---
So druids still used primarily dots for healing. 
---
Shaman still used totems, chain heal, and healing wave for healing. 
---
Priest still had their masssssive toolbox of shields, hots, hard heals and aoe heals. 
---
To suggest that they became "mostly identical" is just not true. Each class had their own particular style and gameplay mechanic.
---
Yeah even with blocking every ad the site is still laggy as hell. It's annoying because I can usually have chrome open in the background while playing no problem, but if it's on wowhead I start noticing lag in-game pretty frequently.
---
You're shattering minds about how bad vanilla is balanced lmfao
---
Going to play shammy. Yeah I'm leveling as enh/ele but was planning on respeccing to resto around 50, so it's mostly late/end-game I'm worried about the ganking.
---
Have you ever opened a server with a public core? Its not like a script-kiddy could do it without an avalanche of bugs and errors.
---
Im not saying they are amazing with the work but fuck they had to do a lot to keep it running and bugfixing from there..
---
I think its really undermining when you say “oh they pulled it from someone else” - since TBC release Mangos, Arcemu and a handful of other open source emulation software has been developed on by the community. They didn’t zuckerberg it when it was made for everyone.
---
Best practices are that as much as possible is checked into source control.
---
Databases are no different, although I've seen static data maintained outside of SCM.
---
Its risky and shouldn't be done without a good reason.
---
Great thing about databases as well, is they arent compiled. If you have a server backup of a database, you've got everything you need.
---
If you've got an application server backup, congratulations you have a bunch of dlls and bits. Good luck decompiling, adding to SCM and recompiling it.
---
Thank you for reminding me why I camp people.
---
You can research the differences between the popular Pservers and Classic Beta yourself, there are many YouTube videos that go into detail about spawn rates.
---
And I know of at least 4 guilds tweaking their private servers for testing because we’ve been sharing a discord and the data we get.
---
/u/GritsUI See above - The "Forgot Password" option is currently nonfunctional. Apologies for the tag if you're already aware.
---
The video doesn't make OPs assertions of different classes scaling differently a crux of his argument tbh. I'd watch the video. He makes a compelling point from the standpoint of "noone was using it so it didn't get patched until TBC", which ends up being a pretty decent argument honestly.
---
Again that isn’t even close to evidence.
---
Nope. It was their declining player count.
---
Lol no.
---
I was going to create a shaman... then I played a hunter, and now I want a hunter.
---
Oh this is actually a nice change.
---
No problem, all I want is 4str 4sta leather belt.
---
I read that someone spear headed the project to make the new stuff talk to the old stuff
---
time to contact my retail playing cousin
---
I love that teamwork shit. It's so good.
---
I was just so young and bad when it came out that I never reached 60 and experienced the end game so I can’t wait to finally experience that
---
Since you know you are in the wrong and have nothing else to say, you attack a typo in my sentence that you could obviously have figured out for yourself with the condescending comment. Keep me’ coming brother!
---
They didn't. It was a recent miracle that they were able to recover a 1.12.1 database. It's been a problem with a bunch of games, like EverQuest which didn't have any backups either. Which is why they do the TLP garbage instead of true classic servers.
---
Alone
---
Well boosters are on my main for two weeks getting my warrior to 60 3x 300 profs, mc, ony attuned and shadowfang key. So I’m gonna be leveling a hunter alt on my other acc earning as much extra gold for my main as I can within those two weeks. And just use my alt as herb / alc
---
&gt; Juicy Bear Ass, Potion of Water-Based Lubrication, and Doorsock of Privacy that you need to turn in for Murgog's Misha Fantasy.
---
This is not the Vanilla I remember.
---
Not a lot better than BWL or naxx epics though. I am not talking about random BOE epics, i'm talking about the pvm alternative to pvp gear which is just vastly better for pvp than pvp gear is.  I am not discussing whether this is good design or not, I am merely saying that when the playing field is stacked against the PVPers in their own game mode, you can't blame them for taking matters into their own hands and creating their own fun which is what twinking is.
---
Will I need to sub for this stress test if I already played in the previous tests? I can't seem to find out.
---
I am monitoring this thread
---
Warrior and possible druid are the only hybrids in the game. The only class that can perform in more then one role
---
i'm surprised this isn't the #1 post on the sub atm
---
I mean, you can flag yourself anywhere and so can everyone else. Mix it up, have fun with it. Get a friend to roll a rogue and the other a druid and have them stealth and follow you. People will think you're an easy target, flag themselves, and then you and your friends can wreck their shit.
---
You'd be surprised how many people run around flagged on pve realms.
---
Toxic people are going to be toxic. Telling people not to be toxic isn’t going to suddenly change anything.
---
As a priest your class quest staff isn't far inferior from the rank 14 weapon. This current system is pretty stupid, trust me, Ive known 3 rank 14s irl and many more online, I helped many pvpers with their ranks because I mained a druid and the pvp gear was garbage, so I looked for every opportuinity to log on warriors and rogues to 2 shot stuff whenever I had they were offline.
---
Soi soi soi soi
---
Soisoiosisissosisosoos
---
I mean, you need to get somewhere between 10-15 if you wanna try any of the instanced content. So I'd wanna try get to 15 asap before the test runs out, doing some WSG and dungeons would be fun.
---
there were no dwarves in war1.  they were added iirc in war2 riding gryphons iirc, along with 'elven archers,' ogres, goblins, dragons, naval units.

---
Looks like the art on the sides of 90s era arcade machines. I can dig it.
---
Lol Paladins aren't that much harder than Warriors to tank dude. Their strength comes in AoE pulls, because basically all their threat comes from AoE. Run in, start getting hit, proccing Ret Aura/BoS/Shield spike, drop a consecration, and then every 8 seconds drop a low rank consecration. Not much harder than tab sundering, and you can technically keep aggro on an infinite amount of mobs. The reason they suffer in raid fights is due to a penchant for running oom in long fights, and having no snap aggro mechanic. If you lose aggro you aren't getting it back. Telling potential Prot Pallies that they're in for a bad time is just harmful to their image, they can tank 5 man's perfectly fine, it's just that warriors traditionally have an easier time of it.
---
If Blizzard don't keep Classic servers up after Naxx and force a Classic TBC, do you think private servers will return?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB7F_d_kwIg
---
&gt; What's this ancient thing called a timestamps and a screenshot?
---
What's this thing called reading comprehension? I did mention things can be faked. Either recorded from a private server, or photoshopped, which is why I wanted something by Blizzard that keeps track of these things and show the to the public, thus it can't be faked.
---
He mentions this in the video, and argues it's really only a motivation to grieve on people getting their Wbuffs, who were just going to log afterward anyway, and not a major factor in sustained wPvP. Worth checking out his argument, honestly.
---
Okay so you’re just speaking out your ass completely now.  Thanks for wasting my time thought you might have actually wanted an education on this topic but it seems you’re happy where you are in your delusion lol.
---
Yes as I said.  WOTF is will of the forsaken which cleanses fear or poly.  But in beta they just had perma immunity.
---
If you blocked 11 people because you used rockbiter in a lvl 30 dungeon I'm willing to bet this isn't even close to the full story, or you just took some slight ribbing/trolling super personally.
---
Dumb question; does downloading the client to play in this save any future downloading to play upon Classic's release?
---
Lol k bro, say whatever you need to do you can sleep at night. 
---
The proof of concept was created after the meeting with nost. You’re just an inbred.
---
You can't invis pot in combat. You can use the Gnomish Cloaking Device in combat though.
---
Just watch any Retail wow classic streamer on Twitch.
---
The synergy between tanks and healers is like an unspoken union
---
Ah nice! I started sorta working on one but my limited knowledge of coding made me abandon it. I'm sure something similar will turn up.
---
That won't be the case with content that is 15 years old. But if it still gives you that much stress, don't play.
---
Ive seen like 1 to 7, but the problem is really after you get rank 11, you need a solid month from 13 to 14, and 3 weeks from 12 to 13 and 2 weeks from 11 to 12, thats 2 months and 1 week IF youre rank 1 through all of them which means you will get rank1 4 first on server, but most of us won't. Its reall about 4 months of straight up no life 12hours non stop pvping, i hope blizzard wont implement this system in 2019 because honestly, I think theh can get sued for it
---
After more than a decade of WoW, I never ganked or killed lowbies. I did engage players on my lvl tho. I'll never join the coward's crew.
---
&gt;Let's be 100% honest when we say that 5 man dungeons are easy
---
Yet you made a decision to make one specifically LESS easy on the tank? Fuck that guy though, right?
---
&gt;The tank in this instance was 3 levels higher than me. He had no problems holding threat, at all.
---
He mentioned your use of rockbiter. He was aware that he would have to work harder to have 'no problem' holding threat.
---
If your tank is saying "hey, that makes my job harder" --- don't do that thing.
---
That link is an awesome resource. Had no idea about it. Thanks a ton for the information.
---
You have to pause your dps for the tank to catch up. Any other dps class doesn't have to pause their dps unless the tank really sucks of course.
---
If it doesn't matter then why don't you take rockbiter off?  Personally no need toxicity I just kick the dumdums
---
An American based stress test with a specific request to play with the first few hours, but they start is at a time that 3 of the 4 time zones in are still in business hours. Good plan....
---
I don't see much value in calling them equally garbage without any explaining. 
---
This guy has a lot of videos on ench dps and while not top tier, I wouldn't call his numbers garbage. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLVnYVJKweY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLVnYVJKweY)
---
DPS are expendable, they only make the run faster
---
Try /equipmentslot 16 and 17. Should be your main and offhand, if it works similar to legion client.
---
You can't use them in combat but you can use Gnomish Cloaking Device to go in stealth mid-fight. It doesn't drop combat though. You can look at archives/old comments on the wowhead/allakhazam/etc. pages of Invisibility Potion/Lesser Invisibility Potion to see for yourself.
---
Wait isnt loktar ogar slay them all in orc? Red wedding not a good wedding.
---
Your fun comes at the expense of other players’ fun. That’s what I dislike about PvP servers. People who play them have fun by not letting others have fun.
---
This is how you make time pass more slowly.
---
how do you plan on levelling via bgs lol
---
I thought it was one guy multiboxing? Have they come out publicly?
---
"victory or death"
---
Actually blizzard offered some of them jobs
---
If you let yourself get camped repeatedly, you're doing something wrong. It doesn't bother me when I get ganked in wpvp, and I never let it happen multiple times in a row.
---
PVE servers is like not even an authentic experience. It loses a huge part of the game.
---
I took Tues-Fri off and if I see huge maintenance gaps I'll either go take a nap or go in to work for a couple of hours so I don't lose all of my PTO. ;P Work is maybe 10 min from my house so it'd work all right.
---
Also can be dead through the whole instance, no xp I believe.
---
Been in the private server scene for over 5 years and never once heard anything from this JohnTron on vanilla wow.
---
Oh, child. I'm a priest. I do the hurting.
---
I once taped a flat piece of cardboard to the bottom of my fan, turned my mouse upside down, and put a weight on the 'W' key. As the fan would move back and forth, it'd trigger the optical mouse, and my character would move. I kept my account going for a few days past due by keeping my character logged in this way.
---
In hindsight there are definitely easier ways to accomplish the same thing, and if any GM looked, it would be pretty clear I was doing something dumb. A nelf hunter running into walls in a random Darnassus hut isn't exactly normal behavior.
---
Skip vael
---
Aw, someone on the internet doesn’t agree with your unfounded opinions, poor baby.
---
&gt; You won’t get better at it unless you practice and you won’t find that practice on a PVE server.
---
But some people just don't enjoy PVP. Sure I could get better, but I don't enjoy it. I could become a world champion at sucking dick, but I don't want be the best at something I don't enjoy.
---
I can't watch the video at work but, in this case I don't need to. If you are in a top guild where everyone is good and playing well. The numbers enh puts forward are garbage. To be clear I don't care. I'm not shitting on people for being enh and, I don't see the issue with one in a casual guild because they take hours to complete content anyway.
---
However for my purposes I hate pve that takes too long. I wanna be in and, out in an instant so I don't want anyone slowing that down. That being because I like pvp a lot more. I am very willing to pvp with enh or ret on my team even though they are a bit worse then optimal. However my goal isn't to "fly through" pvp. It's just to have fun.
---
As of a few days ago after a configuration change on blizzards end that entry shows up for everyone that has the client installed still. Whether or not the play option is greyed out shows if you've been invited. For the upcoming stress test there are no invites and all retail US accounts can participate.
---
Niiiice
---
I reactivated my account for the stress test Wednesday. It’s been fun looking at my characters and all the old gear but withball the changes idk how interested I am in actually playing retail
---
&gt;  Have heard the game hasn’t been that great for a while now so I never really experienced the “best” time of the game.
---
The "best" time of the game in terms of story, character development, and what you can do was really Legion. 
---
&gt; First time I ever played WoW was like 10 years ago as a Dwarf hunter but I never got out of the snowy areas so I don’t really count that.
---
You and a huge percentage of others that first picked up the game. Most people that first picked up World of Warcraft actually quit playing after hitting level 10 back in the day. This was one reason why Blizzard redid all of the starter zones and "old world" content with Cata. 
---
&gt; Would it be worth giving classic a shot?
---
It's free with a subscription so at worst you'd be out $15. Keep in mind that Classic is a different beast than retail. This version of the game is going to be 10 years old basically. So of course graphics will be 2007 level graphics, ***if*** that's a deal breaker for you. It is for some. 
---
Vanilla was far from a balanced game. Some classes just beat other classes in pvp combat and there's nothing you can do about it. Some classes are ***not*** viable for endgame content or you will have difficulties finding a group that will take you. Some classes are only good with certain setups that you have to have or you won't perform as well. 
---
I'll give you an example. Enhancement shaman are just not good in pvp. You are easily kited. You have no real mechanic to absorb damage dealt (no cooldowns) and you can't really get to your target (you can't charge, run fast, break snares, stealth, etc). If you want to be good in pvp as an enhancement shaman you ***have*** to take engineering. It is required. 
---
PvE has it's pitfalls too. Want to be a Prot Paladin in Classic? You're in for a tough uphill battle and you'll almost always be worse than any other tank available because you literally do not have the tools to do your job as well as them. Prot Paladins do not get a taunt ability even though druids and warriors get it. Prot paladins do not get an aoe ability ***at all*** unless you spend points into your healing spec to get consecration. You don't even get your own use damage reduction ability until you spend 31pts into your tank tree. 
---
So it really depends on what you want to do and what class you end up picking.
---
"You yank it, you tank it"
---
fury warrior?
---
Blizzard never said Anything like that. In fact they confirmed exactly what I said instead. Please show me where you saw that info.
---
There wasn't enough people queing in. So you'd never get games... And I never said I only played against premades. I loved one shotting people and then running into others on the other side that were geared and having back and forth fights with them.
---
Most of the good ones were not available in TBC raids, if i understand correctly. they were patched shortly after TBC dropped. Also, they weren't used prominently until Nax according to the video that started this debate, but which time the devs were focusing on the now impending TBC release, thus providing a fairly strong argument that they were not intended as a mechanic to be used in raids in classic either.
---
Unless you’re a rogue or druid there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. You don’t ress with buffs, full health or mana, and they will be sitting there fully buffed spamming a macro that contains /tar &lt;yourname&gt;. You’re never going to win that. The only thing you can do is spirit healer ress and go somewhere else, or log off and come back later.
---
Hell yes. now i dont have to mog to pretend to be a slut. I can get ass naked on a mailbox and live the dream.
---
Hey buddy, this isn’t about opinions.  This is literally facts and you’re LITERALLY making them up.  Now if we are talking about whether private servers are fun or not now THAT would be an opinion.  You’re just making bullshit up
---
&gt; Kindly go back to retail. Classic take s time
---
Ok kid, just seems like if you have to always be twinked out Retail and heirloom sounds up your alley, I dont need to always be bis to have fun but what ever floats your epeen
---
&gt;Spirit healer res and go somewhere else
---
Exactly.
---
Dear Jeremy, I noticed on the show how you pronounce pwn as pone but me and my friends say own, what gives?
---
IIRC, you got a repeatable quest from the WSG/AB entrances to turn in tokens. A win would net you 3 tokens, and a loss would net you 1. Turn in 3 for experience.
---
i remember seeing an onyxia done with 40 priests
---
so, probably
---
if anyone wants to try it out: Analrapist /password
---
There's  some dumb things: 
---
* You don't check faction quests. Eg, Alliance can't get warlords command (they get maxwell's mission)
---
* You need to have an option for no world drops/BOE rares, but include crafted BOE/BOP's. I'm not buying cassandra's grace/papal fez.
---
Other than that, really nice!
---
Druid: 
---
\- Can't use Roots indoors / in caves.
---
\- Can't Pot / Engi in forms
---
It may add some flavor, but heck, I can root in the middle of the lake with no ground or whatever. Let me root in caves :C
---
Yeah that shit gets real annoying after a while.
---
I will say that you are coming to the wrong place for an un-biased opinion. 
---
Having said that - WoW classic will have you among a community who loves the game. There will be sweaty try-hards but if you take it slow they will outpace the rest of the pack quickly and you'll be left with the rest of us. Many of us will be happy to help you out.
---
When you're leveling find a warrior to pair yourself up with. You'll have a more social experience and they will typically need the help.
---
Just pay up now snd and enjoy the game when it comes out. You won't make it and it wont be fun trying.
---
Over nine thousand
---
Classic will be even easier due to the broken HP recovery rates.
---
It's about the state of a single server tho
---
What makes you think I'm going to read any of this if you CLEARLY aren't going to read mine? Just curious?
---
It’s primarily a meme spec.
---
Hi, /u/TreantGlass

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1uj4j/you_dont_need_an_active_sub_to_get_invited_to_the/). 
---
Just do what everyone else is doing, spend all your time watching classic videos on youtube and plan out your character. Over and over.
---
The fact that you had to go to your guild for validation because this tank pissed you off. And then you blocked 11 people because you were so mad that they disagreed with you... Really makes you sound like the jerk here.
---
You can go ahead and block me on reddit now, along with all the users who aren't stroking your oversized clitoris.

Idea: Replace Twitch Language with Chuck Norris jokes.
---
&gt; Twitch.tv/nanonost
---
Dude you should advertise this a bit, I had no idea. Favorited and will def start tuning in!
---
Easier?  Maybe.  Quicker? Not even remotely.  Respawn rates alone is going to be the key for speed.  Which I hope we are all aware that private servers will be unmatched in the respawn rates
---
And with less money.
---
How?
---
Ya for macros like that you want equip weapon slot or equip bag slot if I remember correctly.
---
Now we need to see a 40 man Druid only raid.
---
Ive played plenty of druid [was my main thru WotLK] and I felt that boomkin was better in PvP. The Hord having two high armor casters is nice. Also, as a Druid you can stealth and flank easily.
---
I'm sorry I don't understand. Do you mean it's coming out 11pm PST and not 3pm?
---
totally agree... leaving 15 beer :) better for my health anyways. Just paid a NA sub while having paid a EU sub only for beta :D Blizzard takes my money again...
---
I like how Chinglish think Nostalrius and p-servers had nothing to do with us getting Classic WoW :D:D
---
Nice reference
---
Wrong place to post this. This should go in the LFG post
---
Pfffft "69"
---
Just a fancy word for sexual socialism!
---
&gt;Streamer idolization
---
Pretty sure it's been the opposite.
---
Some people just don’t want to play with morons.  
---
Tank threat can be a real problem at low levels and so can healer mana. 
---
Leave the min maxing to level 60?
---
That’s fine - but don’t make shit harder than they have to be either.
---
Yeah I think doing 14,000 damage in a single ability is too much. I mean you're welcome to have a different opinion, but my opinion is that I don't like it.
---
Its my subjective opinion. I have no idea why you're bent out of shape about that.
---
https://youtu.be/u48WF9uIpZo
---
Starting zone mobs are easier to kill on Classic WoW Beta.
---
Named mobs and lootable objects are on a 5 minute or longer respawn timer on Private Servers.
---
Named mobs are on a 30 second to 2 minute respawn timer on the Beta.
---
Lootable objects respawn instantly.
---
Get fucked kid.
---
Being downvoted by people who think Blizz is doing this out of the kindness of their giant corporate hearts and not because they are betting they will make a good profit.
---
Just stop reading anything below this comment, you're but going to learn anything but you will see a bunch of idiots argue about the same shit we've seen here for the last year. How welcome.
---
What did he actually do to generate this hate?
---
I only played a Priest as my main class with Shaman and Druid as alts from Vanilla to WotLK. I plan on playing a Warrior as my main class with a Paladin and Rouge as alts for Vanilla.
---
They’ve already said they’re in it for the long haul now. I don’t know the exact business model they plan to run with Classic but everything they’ve said so far leads me to believe we will get at least TBC and Wotlk. They just can’t officially say it because then if something goes wrong, they have to eat their words.
---
I literally canceled mine yesterday.
---
Teldrassil 100% had bears :)
---
Good natured PvP being done for fun and without camping. This is what PvP should be about for Rogues.
---
\[\[\[F E M U R\]\]\]
---
Its good in PvP, in WSG its awesome at flag defence, stealth, into dots and emergency heals.
---
PraIsE BE HiS NaME
---
Never had an issue. I was mad when they removed it.
---
It is on a separate tab in the Bnet launcher. Above the blue "PLAY" button you can switch between your main retail account and the beta/stress test account and download the classic client there.
---
As someone who waits for football to start all summer you will definitely notice the wait
---
So you are saying it is not popular and thus you can't get a queue? The popularity died off as soon as you could no longer pubstomp. Thus the big lie. I'm sure there are a few who just wanted to play against other twinks, but those are the 10 people who still queued and couldn't find a game. The rest all went away since they couldn't one shot leveling players anymore.
---
NA, undecided faction, 23 y/o
---
LF fellow no lifers for classic launch (and possibly before via other means of vanilla) to get to 60 at a quick, yet enjoyable pace.
---
I plan to play mage, leaning alliance (prefer their starting zones and cities) 
---
I plan to be ahead of the pack in most regards, I want to be geared with a solid group of 3-4 for phase 2 wpvp annihilation.
---
I am not a min-max raider, I just like progressing through content . I plan to clear all raids relatively quickly , though. To me, this is casual, as I am a no lifer. Hardcore to me is min-max raiding and going for rank 14, although to most people with kids and a full fledged career I probably seem hardcore.
---
Haven't committed to any guilds yet, more concerned with finding a buddy for the journey. 
---
Lmk if we may be a good fit , I will bring the food and water ! (And portals, post-lvl 42.)
---
Right? Where do I sign up?
---
That's the point, as soon as you couldn't pubstomp anymore people stopped playing those characters. Now that you were only facing other geared players the fun was gone and popularity died.
---
Neither.
---
&gt;Debate: is Lazor Chicken [aka Balance Druid] primaly a PvP spec?
---
No, you can pvp ok with balance but you don't pick up moonkin form. It costs too much mana, only helps vs a couple of classes and prevents you from getting NS - an actual good talent.
---
&gt;Or, does the aura give a raid group enough insentive to pick up one for the utility?
---
Nope, balance is severely crippled by mana issues and gear requirements in raids. It's never *worth it* from a raid utility perspective (of course you still can if you don't mind getting carried a bit).
---
1. How easy/difficult would it be to get into a semi-hardcore raiding guild as a \[Warrior / Priest\] or \[Warrior / Druid\]? (Would a priest be more in demand? Would a warrior tank be in demand pre-naxx?)
---
Getting a raiding spot as a priest is easy, especially as a dwarf alliance side due to the dwarf priest racial fear ward.  Druid can be tougher in a semi-hardcore guild (interpreting this as guild that tries to run as optimal a set-up as possible but might tweek stuff here there to fit a bit more laid back attitude towards the game). Stacking druids is pretty inefficient so an optimal setup will have 1 druid. Therefore it might be harder finding a spot in a semi-hardcore guild that might run 2 max 3 druids. It very much depends on what kind of guild you guys are aiming to join.
---
1. I understand a pain for Druids was lack of a res, but exactly how much of a pain was it for 5mans? (Any examples welcome)
---
If u and your tank friend are running dungeons together it shouldn't be an issue. Sure if someone dies on every pull it's gonna be a bother but otherwise it's fine.
---
It's a meme
---
There isn't that much skill in vanilla pvp. If you have raid gear you are going to dumpster people.
---
I know this is reddit and it easier to just downvote but please comment if there's something that I wrote, you disagree with. Don't be shy.
---
If there were no streamers these guys would still be relatively unknown. Just saying.
---
Agreed. As much as i wanted it, the ultimate choice is up to the consumer. Not going to give my money to Blizz just yet. Wont be missing out on too much. Sure the new meta is pretty cool, but hey, were all gonna start at level 1 anyway.
---
It's possible I saw a good pally tank. The problem is taunting esp for fights that require you to taunt
---
The pirated server meta is based on guesswork from the pirated server developers.

Typing your instead of you're is the keyboard turning equivalent of the English language.

The Oran'Thul is a dedicated, goal-oriented group of hardcore gamers seeking raiders and PvPers for Classic WoW. 
---
Our plans for Classic WoW include being top guild on our server while still providing an atmosphere that also welcomes more casual players. We intend to have two 40 player raid groups totaling 80 hardcore raider slots. We have a ranking system that provides raid slot and loot priority to those that align with the hardcore play style and plan to show up to MOST raids. For more information, please review a detailed breakdown on our website: https://www.oranthul.com/home/m/49064920/article/4842852
---
Our core members are extremely knowledgeable of all Classic WoW content and provide an environment where you can learn your class, ask questions and improve your skill set. We have cleared all content in Classic WoW including all world bosses and 15/15 Naxx. Furthermore, we have achieved world-best standing in past MMOs, most notably ArcheAge.
---
If you strive to be the best you can be, know what it means to put the organization first, and want a guild and community to call home from day one, then perhaps this is the place for you. With 15+ years of activity and an absolute 0% chance that we will quit Classic WoW or disband—as commonly witnessed with many other guilds—we offer you unparalleled stability and a place to call home! JOIN US!

---
Yeah, that skill you learned at lvl 30.  That's your main spell, welcome to down ranking!
---
Love many aspects of vanilla.
---
What about a sticky with changing counter?
---
I don't like them. Anything that promotes me not playing my main character is a stupid mechanic.
---
You gotta post in under the right section now as they are organizing it more for ease of use. So Guilds: Europe - Alliance - PvP
---
Enhance can work for pvp but I recommend 1h+ shield but the 1hr needs to be solid. But even in pvp I think shamans are still a support role. Be looking to heal and buff your allies. I say use a  shield to have some protection against meleers because that's all you got to help you survive. No cc other than earthbind and frost shock. Usually when alliance see a shaman they are the focus fire. Ally hates shamans.
---
People about to find out why this game is important.
---
I have a lore theory that I developed thanks to Archeology:
---
There were Paladins before the Silver Hand. [Tunadil the Redeemer](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=90410/notched-sword-of-tunadil-the-redeemer) may have been an ancient Paladin. Or maybe not. I'd like to think that since the Tome of Divinity existed long before the Silver Hand, perhaps others might have used it to become Paladins/Justicars as well.
---
Thanks for the quick write up and summary. That explains Blizzard’s set up fairly well to me. I guess I can understand the reasoning behind obfuscating this data so that those most dedicated players can’t come up with “cheese” methods to clear the highest tier content easier. I still wish I could see it because I love nerding out on that stuff lol
---
Asks me to post video evidence, refuses to watch the video evidence.
---
Okay kid. Stick to Retail.
---
Mages exist

**&lt;E X I L E&gt;**
---
**Faction:** Alliance
---
**Region:** EU - English Speaking
---
**Server Type:** PVP
---
**Guild Focus:** PVE
---
**About Us:**    E X I L E is a guild formed from a group of friends, most of which   have  played wow hardcore since Vanilla and are currently raiding in the   top  100 on retail, we will aim to clear all bosses prior to the next   phase  of content. All of us are extremely active on Discord be it by   playing  WoW together or even other games. We have also met IRL multiple   times  over our years playing together which has created a strong   connection  and we hope to extend this community we have going forward   into Classic  WoW.
---
**Raid Times:**    As most of us wish to keep raiding on retail in our hardcore guilds  we   will raid different days from the norm to accommodate this.    Friday/Tuesday CET - 20:00-00:00 (We may add a Saturday night during the    first 1 or 2 weeks of progress if there is enough interest)
---
**Loot Rules:** We will most likely use EPGP loot distribution with additional priority for important roles such as Main Tank etc.
---
**Recruitment:**    We are currently looking for any players who wish to experience all    content that Vanilla WoW has to offer at a more relaxed pace to allow    IRL time or time for other games. Socials are also welcome to join our    community and have fun in dungeons, pvp and other games with us.
---
**CURRENTLY RECRUITING**
---
You can check out our current roster and recruitment needs here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VU6gIWk4iDepdJSIhJN-mfM5xGeQTtyslFkP9e2vwvU/edit#gid=861069355](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VU6gIWk4iDepdJSIhJN-mfM5xGeQTtyslFkP9e2vwvU/edit#gid=861069355)
---
**DON'T    BE DETERRED IF YOUR CLASS IS NOT LISTED HERE, WE ARE ALWAYS ON THE    LOOKOUT FOR EXCEPTIONAL PLAYERS AND SOME MAY EVEN BE WILLING TO REROLL    TO ALLOW YOU TO PLAY WHAT YOU WANT**
---
We    do not care if you are a veteran at Classic wow or if this would be    your first time, we simply ask that you are serious about playing in    Classic WoW and our community.
---
**What we expect from you:**
---
**Communication.**    You must must be able to communicate effectively in English in game   and  over voice com. You must therefore have a decent   microphone/headset. We  use Discord as our VOIP.
---
**Dedication.**    We don’t have any insane crazy requirements, we simply ask that you    prepare the basics for your character including consumables and  enchants
---
**Attitude**.    If you are a total asshole, then this probably isn’t the place for   you,  we aim to continue and extend our current atmosphere and   friendship  group.

**Attendance.** Near 100% attendance should be mandatory for all raiders especially since we will only be raiding 2 days.
---
**Connection**.    We expect that you will have a reliable internet connection, we know    this is vanilla but that doesn’t mean you should be playing on a dial  up   connection from 2004! :P
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---
A home and community which you are encouraged to be a part of both outside and inside of raids.
---
A well formed community between players allowing for you to find something to do even on empty days of the week.
---
A new group of friends to interact and play games with.
---
Progress at a steady, constant pace.
---
**How to join:** Make an application: [https://forms.gle/bUYD4XV3XRA5zy4W9](https://forms.gle/bUYD4XV3XRA5zy4W9)

Thank goodness for people like them. Some nameless streamers that are being toxic as fuck were breeding hate on their 30k viewer channel today while people like Nostalrius were the true pioneers of bettering wow in general. Down with toxic streamers, and up with good friendly players and communities.
---
omg
---
Its alright. The gnome specialists wait in the ranks for release
---
Chain proc dosnt work in 1.12? 
---
Fuck I fought it was chain all troughout Classic :(
---
US-Tichondrius laughs at your attempts at claiming 'urban legend.'
---
I'm guessing you don't know what the phrase 'arena junkies' means either, do you?
---
Why thats dumb. Rogues are villains they should do villainous shit. How else are my precious Horde pups going to learn hatred for the Alliance? Every server should have rogues that are viewed like little Tyrants. Otherwise why the fuck did you pick rogue? Then as a fine upstanding citizen. On my warrior I can find a hunter buddy and together we can track those villains down and murderize them.
---
Well I fucked up the title and it's no stress test for EU.
---
You're going to try to avoid failure no matter what , but it's very foolish not to plan for worst case scenarios.
---
Plus, have you ever done an undead Strath run with three paladins and a priest? It's awesome!
---
Well then he's missing the point, as this is about fights between entire guilds running into the raid, not picking off people as they're actually getting the buffs. That has always been a huge content creator on private servers.
---
69 Dude!

A r14 will legitimately 2-shot a person in blues.
---
OP isn't going to get the response they are looking for making this post. Playing the game how you want is fine, but when the enjoyment of others comes into play too, mindfulness starts to become important. 
---
Reputation is also a real thing in Vanilla. So you can't be upset when "playing how you want to" leads to people not wanting to play with you in the future.
---
1st question: The preform the same, native level or leveled up... You will need to get other pets so you can learn different abilities for your pets. ( Bite, Dash etc. ) 
---
2. Generally you want to keep your pet at green. If you neglect it too much and it goes to red there is a chance it will run away. I've had some run away shortly after hitting red. Ive had others stick around for long enough to get food for them.
---
3. Yes it is doable. You will die a lot on the run but you can make it to the human zone.
---
4. Yes, you can do the quest chain, race for that doesn't matter as long as you are alliance.
---
I did this with my first serious alt in vanilla, hit 60 right about 3 days played
---
I reply: smaller groups please. I'm not in a hurry
---
Tank: Cowabunga it is then!
---
How did you recover your photobucket? Mine seems to be gone, along with all my great vanilla screen shots ;(
---
So from reading that article and going along with restoring history panel at blizzcon 2018. Sounds like the metadata you’re referring to is the same as the database data. Which they have and found. Yes in the past they explicitly said they didn’t have the database data they have since said they found.
---
The reason I say this is the way Chilton says their database for the “metadata” was written is exactly like Omar says the database data was written in the restoring history panel. 
---
Now you can believe they did or not that’s a whole other debate.
---
I see your Orc Shaman has a distinct bump in it allowing you to find it by feel :)
---
anyone know if we have to download the client? Is there a way to download it ahead of the test, if not how big is the download?
---
How does that keep you from playing your main?
---
That superiority complex of PvP players is hysterical. I’m going to play on a pvp server, but if you’re going to play casual and not spend many hours and are already worried about getting ganked. I would not.
---
Considering I directly addressed one of the things you said well past the first sentence, must be pretty miraculous that somehow I knew you’d mentioned game theory without reading it.
---
Can you elaborate? How does world buffs affect that? Nobody forces you to use world buffs(?)
---
The game releases simultaneously globally, so it releases at 11pm GMT
---
Undead heavy dungeons, epic paladin quest are two good reasons
---
Paladin epic mount quest you especially want lots of pallies. It makes it a million times easier.
---
Cuff links lol.
---
No, it’s not.  If it was good - it would be used at higher levels of competitive play. It’s not - and so it isn’t.  There’s no role that you can do as a balance Druid that is not DRASTICALLY better covered by another class/spec. 
---
It is not good. 
---
Can you make it work?  Fuck man, with enough preparation and consumables and only counting specific engagements sure - just about anything can work. But it is not good. 
---
It’s also not good in pve. The aura you provide to one party of the raid is not enough of a dps boost to compensate for the trash dps you’ll provide after 30 seconds since you’ll be OOM.

&gt; PVP: Horde [Racials, **Better Queue Times**

Balance Druid is fine or even good in Battlegrounds, absolute garbage in wPVP and PVE. Boomkin is garbage in all scenarios.
---
You'd get some buffs then you'd have to logout in Stormwind/Orgrimmar. Then you'd have to log back in when the Dragonslayer buff was being activated, then after getting that logging back out again.
---
The buff timer only goes down when you're logged in. You'd have to be logged out to preserve the buffs until it was raid day.
---
I think he's talking about logging out to save them.
---
Grats man!!! Awesome!
---
Barking dog lost Homeworld Cataclysm as well.
---
What a surprise, you're a T_D idiot. I fucking knew it! You sound like such a whiny little bitch haha. You got stomped by a twink 12 years ago and you can't let it go. I think Classic is going to be tough for you little guy.
---
I'm an AGI build and I like big numbers.
---
Nost fanboys have infiltrated this sub. I don't think they actually believe that Blizzard is launching Classic directly because of Nost, but they like to pretend and pay each other on that back. Kinda sad lol.
---
Dude please monetize this. In some way shape or form this is an absolutley insane tool. Way to useful and good to be given away for free.
---
LOL JUST READ YOUR EDIT.  So on the comment above you state that classic has quicker dynamic respawns and at the same time saying it doesn’t but it will if they fix it. 
---
You can’t help yourself making shit up can you.  Which is the truth.

You have to log out to preserve world buffs man. Its how it works.
---
Yea, the point of the thread is that the enjoyment of others was not hindered and won't be by what you THINK matters. Sorry, unpopular opinion but it doesn't. At 60 sure, you can minmax.
---
From what I understand, part of the problem was that they didn't do a great job matching asset backups to source code versions, or at least keeping those backups alive long-term - this is a problem I had for years before stuff like Git LFS came along so I feel the pain. It's been a while since I watched the talk about this, but iirc the only complete assets backup they could retrieve was the last one before BC launch, and that's pretty much why we're getting the last patch right off the bat.
---
They're secretly testing how stressed the EU population gets by seeing even more people gain access to the beta.
---
patience, my friend. Soon it will be ours.
---
I agree with you however given the differences between private servers and retail it still gives the player a testing ground to play with ideas, keybinds, questing ect.
---
I believe that you will have an extreme advantage 
---
Testing out routes on a private server beforehand
---
Anyone who get's their panties in a twist over a level 30 instance needs to chill the fuck out. Those 11 people blocked are probably time saved from you having to do it later when they freak out over something else inconsequential.
---
You mean the ONE comment talking about regular mob respawn rates which I posted another video from a WoW developer confirming is a bug? Just stop.
---
You might not live with your parents and are able to vote, but that doesn't mean you're not acting like a child.
---
Or your guild coordinates all this for raid day, that's how mine did it. We'd all go touch what ever flower that was in feralas then pop a port to org and drop a head.  Easy peasy
---
Druids that ever want to consider tanking will want to level enchanting up to 230? (I think it is) for smokey heart of the mountain. Its a bop craft trinket with a decent amount of armour. You can drop enchanter afterwards.
---
I mean, he mentions this specifically as well. I'm just saying you should watch it before you commit to hard to an opinion on this. The guy makes a decent point.
---
Thought this was debunked as a rumor with no source.
---
Keep your pet happy! You don’t want to deal with loyalty trouble. Swing by a Butcher NPC and buy a stack of meat- it’s cheap and lasts a long time. 25% extra dps is great. You’ll want to level as beast master, it’s the strongest, and your pet DPS matters more with it.
---
iirc it's not very big, &lt;10gb I think
---
gotcha, i thought it was a one time per bracket but prob wrong - glhf (:
---
I never once said respawn rates for regular mobs is faster on the Beta.
---
I can give you an explanation why tanks hate it when in dungeons somebody begins to act as a second tank and generate extra threat without being asked. 
---
Firstly, rage starvation. Believe it or not, especially in 5man content the tanks often get rage starved and have to take damage to keep up their work. By drawing aggro without being asked you are handicapping the tank's performance and put more stress on the healer. 
---
Secondly, the way how threat works. The tank will have to gain 110% of your threat to get the mob back with the implication that tank very likely generates less rage. Taunts resist way more often then you want them and have a cooldown. 
---
Thirdly, the very moment you draw threat healer begins to generate more threat since he has to heal harder. On the other hand, the tank starts to generate less as a consequence of the first two implications. 
---
You can play what you want when you are solo, if you're being asked to stop doing something in a group for a reason, perhaps you should take that into consideration.
---
Consecration is 11 points

---
dont waste your time, its a 9min chromaggus kill where the other dps spend more time afk/not hitting the boss
---
Yeah there's a bunch of private server tuning issues that have serious knock on effects. Just for a simple example, in private servers the mobs in the starting zone have the standard avoidance all other mobs have. But in classic and vanilla the starting zone mobs have considerably less avoidance, and the spell damage is much lower.
---
This makes melee classes significantly easier on classic/vanilla, and that's just a few percentage points of avoidance difference on low level mobs. In private servers level 9 prowlers can dunk you, but in classic/vanilla you can handle 2-3 at a time as a warrior or paladin. 
---
Thats just a small example showing how tiny errors can have knock on effects that really change the difficultly and viability of things.
---
&gt; You're using a group to gear up a level 60 &amp; preying on other level 60s who don't have a guild to gear them up. 
---
The alternative is just as unfair, but in a different way.
---
It's not finding them that's the issue, it's the waiting. Vanilla didn't have summoning stones so unless you got a warlock you've now got likely a 10+ min wait ahead of you. It's easier to just try to talk to the DPS and rest of the group than go nuclear and let people die or begin kicking folks.
---
**&lt;Sharp And Shiny&gt; | NA | RP - PvE | Progression Raiding Guild**
---
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
---
Who are we: &lt;Sharp and Shiny&gt; is a PvE progression focused guild made up of a mix of folks with original vanilla and private server experience as well as other MMOs. We are currently looking for more to round out our pre launch roster.
---
What to expect from us: Those who choose to be a part of our guild can expect to be a part of a focused but relaxed raiding environment that will clear fresh content quick and effectively. In classic, we want to put a larger focus on having more casual members or socials to in the future allow for more out of main raid activities, such as PvP, dungeons, and raid PuGs, which we hope will reduce the onset of raid log mentality.
---
What we expect from you: We have a 80% minimum raid attendance requirement. We intend to be in Molten Core 4 weeks after launch at the latest and have a hard leveling time cap of 6 weeks to hold a raid spot. After hitting cap, we expect each raider to be working towards their pre raid BiS as well as farming for their raid consumables. We expect every member to act mature, especially to those outside of the guild, as we will be very conscious of our guilds reputation on the server that we choose to play. Mainly just don't be a dick.
---
Why RP-PvE?: The community. While the guild itself is not RP restricted and we have no RP expectations for any of our members, we are rolling on a RP server to avoid the elitism and toxicity that is sometimes prevalent on PvE and PvP servers. We also plan on possibly holding server community events that we believe will be more accepted on an RP server.
---
Raid times: Sun/Tues 6:00 - 9:00 PST with a potential third day added come phase 5
---
Loot system: Loot Council
---
What are we currently looking for?:
---
Fury Warriors
---
Mages
---
Warlocks
---
If you don't fit these rolls feel free to contact me, as we will always be welcoming of exceptional applicants of any class.
---
 https://discord.gg/eC2KzmS
---
The really low parry chance opened up tanks to tank to dw tanking.  This, and dps spec in general, won't work as well for tanking in classic.  That might be a big shift in it's own.  
---
Blizz might step in and fix some of the exploits too.  Like world buff stacking, and the annihilator axe are two prevalent in raiding.
---
In Vanilla, No it was a spec people went into for fun but it was not good for raiding or pvp.
---
In BC / Wrath it was good in PVP and Raiding because in those 2 xpacs you had enough talent points to be a good off healer and the aura they offered hit the whole raid while in Vanilla their aura only effects the party they are in and it was not worth it to bring them in a caster group.
---
Also the gear stats between moonkin and healing are different in Vanilla. There is bonus healing or spell damage not just strait spell power so you would be putting on bonus spell power gear but it has no effects on the healing spells so they are just doing base healing +int.
---
In Vanilla Moonkin's were easy targets for most classes and generally when one popped up in PVP everyone made a beeline to them, not because they were a threat but because they were just easy kills.
---
Sentris the Barbarian Rogue and came from the same guild as Hobbes in Ultimate Online, though he left just as I joined and we didn’t know each other.
---
You said it yourself, 105dps vs 115dps is meaningless so why fight him on it and turn it into a bigger issue by bringing in the outside guild members? It's a none issue if you jsut abide by the tanks wishes. The tank, ya know the person that runs things basically. They set the tone and pace of the run and you changed how the tank does their thing for that meaningless 10dps. And for what a meaningless dungeon while leveling? You say "please just let people play the way they want" by having an ability active that doesn't change the way you play, other than being a little more conscious of your threat... while forcing the tank to play in a way he doesn't want to play and potentially forcing him to use abilities he doesn't want to use in that moment. Just food for thought.
---
If they just disagreed with me and said, "You're wrong but it doesn't really matter." that fine. For them to go as far as to say the things they did, nah, fuck that. I'm 30 now. I don't have time for that anymore. 
---
Great analogy would be if you and I were driving to the same place but you INSISTED that I stay directly behind you. Why? We're going to the same destination. Nothing at low level matters enough to hinder anyone's enjoyment.
---
He was 3 levels higher and never lost threat to me once. I made it so much harder for him.
---
Fixed!
---
It was a meme the day it hatched and showed up in your arathi basin.
---
WHOMST'D'VE BE THOTTIN'???
---
Yes, there is no longer a base game to purchase.
---
Tank had no trouble holding threat against a dps shaman 3 levels below him. Why are you making these assumptions? He literally never lost aggro.
---
There were two maybe three games at Wesswood that I didn’t work on, Nox was one of them. That was a game that Wesswood picked up at a tradeshow and then spent some time and work polishing it up before releasing.

---
Why would you have a "Stress Test" mid day in the middle of the week. Then ask people to go hard in the first 3 hours.
---
Bitch, I'm at work!
---
That's why as a hunter you make sure you're really good at pulling / kiting and always on top of your tranq shots with no huntard blunders.
---
Was in 3 guilds on 2 servers and never had an issue with my raid spot as THE hunter.
---
Fair enough, and it still wasn't available in TBC.
---
for 19 twinks, xp is always an issue because its damn easy to accidentally level.
---
29 for leather classes, especially hunters is a problem because of all the high level quests (razzec's gloves, Raptor Hunter Tunic, Big Game Hunter weapons, etc.)
---
39 its not much of a problem because most BiS items are BoE, and you can can plan out farming sessions for the few drops / quest items several levels in advances along with the much *much* higher xp demands to level.
---
49 is interesting because most BiS gear is from BRD, Temple, Maraudon, and DM.  Instances you most likely need a couple high level characters to farm gear for.  Much more difficult to get the best gear possible, but even more xp cushions there.  Biggest problem is just the sheer time spent leveling to ~45 and then farming higher level dungeons.
---
58 twinking is the odd man out, because at 58 best gear was the level 58 pvp set, which I don't think is possible to get because we are instead getting the buffed req 60 pvp blue set.
---
You are what is wrong with the game and why there are so few tanks
---
Ahhh, which would be like 3pm for PST, gotcha
---
the positives are super minor
---
1-3: sure, barely
---
4: not really cause viable specs also get world buffs and still outperform the unviables
---
5: hardcore guilds stand out less because more casual guilds can do the raids
---
6: guilds progress through the raids faster and run out of content faster.  eventually everybody hits a wall, either you improve and climb above it or you stop climbing.  making the wall shorter makes more people reach the top and are forced to stop climbing because they ran out of wall not because they wanted to stop
---
Pfff, should be fishing
---
Keep reading - it often refers to the ignition, start, spark or other indirectly involved chemical or object that isn't required but directly starts the process.
---
In this case the catalyst was the private servers over a decade old. When folks started going back to Vanilla, that's when we realized that's where we wanted to be - quite a long time ago.
---
The catalyst came and provided the spark to ignite the desire in a lot of Vanilla fans. Nost was just another copy/pasta log on that fire to keep it going.
---
I mean, sure, but even on Pservers it's like a half hour of collecting free world buffs. On live you'll only be able to get like a fraction of them consistently every raid night, and even then, it's 1 hour duration isn't it?
---
So not really something you'll have all night and as such a bit of a bitch cause it may mean you'll buff mid raid instead of before raid. Like once you get to a tough boss, just take a 30-45 minute break and buff everyone. Then you got a like 50ish minutes to do as many pulls as you can and hopefully down em.
---
And if you fuck it up, morale is entirely shot and you're not going any further really. Not to mention that you may be asking people to swap characters, you'd need warlocks to do this in any reasonable amount of time.
---
It's sorta neat to have them, I think, but as is, you're severely cutting into the already very limited time you have on raid night.
---
Same. Really doesn't bother me and if it becomes a issue most people are reasonable enough to cooperate. But most of the time when DPS pull its not too much or everyone is already ready. I never see DPS pull on purpose with the knowledge both the healer and tank are low. Usually its ignorance or a mistake and most people are willing to admit to mistakes if you talk to them without blaming.
---
Kara isn't undervalued at all, it's a super fan favourite, hence the fact it got revitalized in Legion.  It's right up there with Ulduar in terms of popularity, if not above Ulduar.
---
not like it matters, if a ret does more damage, your tanking is bad.
---
Oh, so you're selfish. Got it.
---
The warrior in the OP is wearing mail and the SM shield....
---
Asmondgold looks like he got his head stuck vice
---
You don't know how this game works haha
---
Technically, this will be true most of the day tomorrow.
---
Respawn rates on privates are the same, dynamic respawn only affects those in the zerg.
---
You will not reach the 90hour or less level 60 if you are within the zerg. Classic will be easier, I expect 85hour or less 60 for the most serious of tryhards.
---
You do a thing and someone else in the group asks you not to, you refuse and they grin and bare it, then you complain to your guild for sympathy and get shot down so you block 11 people because you wouldnt as dps do what your tank and healer asked? Good luck when classic launches!
---
Kick them before the last boss and they will never do it again
---
Ah, the boar.
---
Thats the whole point daesgn. It would constantly reshape the meta, but all tier sets would still be viable. It isn't like the expansions where your gear is just useless the day it comes out. You would still be able to raid etc.. using any of the sets, since they would all be T1-T3. The itemization would just be different, and you would be able to customize your builds/playstyles through these set bonuses.
---
You’re level 28.... I think you’re really grasping here with justification for not using flametongue for an hour while grouped.
---
Mid-level dungeons then. Still the same issue.
---
I didn’t do much on Red Alert II. That was mostly done at the Wesswood Pacific office which was originally the Virgin Games office. It was however balanced by Wesswood founder and command and conquer creator Brett Sperry and lead designer Adam Isgreen Who were really the driving force behind those games.
---
"It doesn't really matter, but I'm gonna keep using Rockbiter anyway even though it doesn't matter cause I'm a dickwad" :)
---
In vanilla you can only cast balance spells while in moonkin form. So most people will go 30/0/21, taking nature swiftness, I instead of what is just an extra 3% crit.
---
Yeah even if RP-PVP isn’t at launch, I may just roll RP so that names like Killshotzxx are a reportable offense
---
we dont have spell power in vanilla ;)  its +dmg and +healing
---
but yeah im kinda sad that hybrids aren't hybrids in raids.  its just a cold hard reality though &lt;/3
---
They should really put the Soul Well in Classic and make it charge like 5 soul shards or something. 
---
No fucking way I'd hand out healthstones to every member in the raid.
---
I always kill but never camp. Everybody gets one.
---
Yeah, cause fighting for threat against a shaman who won't take off a weapon enhancement isn't hindering the tank's enjoyment of the game at all /s
---
All of those things were intergral parts of TBC. How can it be WoW's greatest era?
---
Stock CMangOS isn't really worth much. To make a server *good* there's a ton of extra work that needs to go intro it.
---
what guilds fell apart? WoW had a steady increase in players up to wotlk afaik?  
---
Im as fond of server community as you guys but 4hour BG queues just suck. 
---
Although i hope the realm pools are a tiny bit smaller than they were back then, i dont see blizz changing anything about that. They recreate the exact game, not the experience. :/
---
Good point. I believe strongly that TBC and WOTLK are mostly nostalgia.
---
Yeah I'm going to be rolling a lock first, no need to.
---
But after that I'm running groups, and will be kicking people if they can't read or respond to things I'm telling them. If they can't wait a second on DPS, they can't be trusted to do well in any other bit of the dungeon.
---
Like I'd kick a shammy with Rockbiter low level. Cause Flametongue is just fine, and aggro is important in classic. It's also sort of indicative of how you play the game and whether you care about the stress you put on others or not.
---
"You used Rockbiter in a level 28 dungeon! You're ruined on this server! You'll be sorry! ***You'll never group on this server again you're finished you hear me finished!***"
---
I think you also overreacted, though. You could have said "easy guys I get it, I didn't think it was a big deal since the tank has zero issues managing threat." People shitting on you for getting a little careless at level 28 are definitely in the wrong, but I'm not sure that blocking them instead of constructively engaging them was necessary, either. That's 11 people you aren't going to be grouping with and it's probably over a stupid misunderstanding and not necessarily that they're actually toxic assholes.
---
The point here is that instead of listening to MULTIPLE people asking you not to do something - you do it anyway and claim that they are the problem. 
---
They are absolutely right. You’ve shown you’re stubborn and incapable of being a team player. 
---
You will get a bad rep and you will find less and less group willing to play with you. 
---
I’m sure that’s not what even actually happened. I’m sure you went to your guild feeling all high and mighty and felt so good about how you’re going to put this “elitist tank” down and laugh it up with your guild. 
---
Except your guild didn’t side with you. They saw you were in the wrong and you probably argued and had a shitty attitude about it just like you are in this post and thread. 
---
So now you’ve made enemies and since you couldn’t get the support there for your retarded ideas - you’re trying your hand at Reddit.  Looks like most people here are agreeing that you are the toxic one. Not the others in your story.
---
I mean, isn't that the only argument necessary? You're obviously an angry little turd based on your post history. Keep whining though.
---
Nothing like this.  Utilizing a lvl 60 to gear up a twink  you have personally already made the investment of time into the 60.
---
Also all of these people shitting on twinks, who cares.  Let people play the game how they want.  If they want to spend hours and hours and a ton of gold so they can feel good about themselves in lvl 19 Warsong what is it to you? You are going to lose pvp at level 60 also.
---
Very interested
---
Old school Runescape is about as popular as BFA.
---
How long do you need fire resistance gear in mc? At a certain point is gear from the raid itself better to do it in than the resistance or will I pretty much always need the resistance gear sets for each raid tier?
---
are you forgeting that around the time of elisum, it was nostalrius that put out a post saying that we should stop playing classic servers and respect blizzard or some shit like that. They lost whatever weight they had when they did that.
---
But he did indicate that you could be making more work for him. Had he lost aggro how would you have reacted? Would you have been adult enough to say "lol my bad, I guess that answers that question" or would you have blamed the tank because he's 3 levels higher than you?
---
As somebody else said, I think there's more to this simplistic, clearly one-sided story than you've presented.
---
I saw that, it looks decent but it would take a lot of work to get best item at each level.  I've been making a ton of progress with the mysql database I found though.  Hit me up in a few days if you want me to create a sheet for you.
---
Please judge this on the merits of (1) tauren, (2) hunter, (3) pvp-oriented
---
hEEEEREGHH HUUUUgHHH
---
That's a good point. I first thought they meant like only Shamans, Priests, Paladins, and Druids.
---
Well played
---
You can get some talents from it, but its probably mostly a waste to get the actual chicken. Its bonus isn't that good to go so deep and forgo over things. 
---
NS is practically mandatory. Bear charge is very good, as is something like HoTW.
---
Good, I can test a run that I plan to do and adjust my route accordingly :D.
---
I'm on the fence myself. I love pvp, but I'm gonna be leveling as a resto shammy. My plan is to shove my totems up some warriors ass and piggyback off of them, but it'll suck if I have to quest in Tanaris or STV alone. If I've got someone else, at least they can be my bodyguard
---
OSRS rarely ever peaks 100,000 people and a lot of them are bots.
---
BFA has at least 1.5 million subscribers.
---
Just no.
---
As soon as you went combing through post history to try and discredit what I say you lost the argument. Feel free to keep posting nonsense, but you have nothing to say here.
---
Same here!
---
As a person who spent a very LARGE amount of my classic time twinking in classic, I can say that all of twinking was a lot of planning.
---
When achievements were introduced I wanted a twink with the explorer title.  Since I didnt know how much xp that would be, I started at level 1 and just explored everything myself as a side project.  Turns out you could do it by 19 but things like Timbermaw rep for the medicine pouch, yes you had to do it while dead because the sheer mob count was too high (even with reduced xp gain).
---
Ah gotcha. They always yell loktar ogar slay them all in AV. My mistake.
---
I wish you weren't getting downvoted. It's true that most private server GMs are corrupt AF and took a ton of money for themselves.
---
I’m glad he’s horde
---
It wasn’t. But nice try! Anything else to add?
---
No, WoW
---
If it was an issue, I would've swapped np.
---
Why would you even pipe up to say anything? Seems like you were trying to call out the tank as a newb to others in the grp and they shit on you because they are friends. Next time just stfu
---
But the recruiter said I'd be able to buy a new mustang, go real fast
---
Yea, I've made so many enemies on the beta that's going to be wiped soon.
---
Love all your assumptions, too.
---
Fair points. I don't think the positives are minor from a pvp perspective though. But ye on a pve perspective it obviously allows content to be cleared faster, but then again it is old content and a lot of people are really familiar with it. Do you really think that world buffs is going to matter so much that it makes a difference? I'm pretty sure that classic content will be cleared pretty quickly regardless of world buffs.
---
Yes, it was.
---
It will happen for sure on Classic, but you have to remember on Private Servers there is nothing to do. In 60 days the server goes down. Progression doesn't matter. Gold doesn't matter. Reputation farming doesn't matter. Nothing matters.
---
The the thing that keeps people from camping Duskwood Graveyard all day is that there time is better spent farming or getting better gear. On private servers time spent farming is wasted, so may as well just go gank lowbies all day.
---
I promise you it is way worse than it will be on Classic. Will low level ganks happen? Yes, but not to the crazy extent it currently is on private servers.
---
You’ve proven that your attitude is the issue and will bar you from success. You’ve done it in the beta, on reddit, and you show such a massive lack of tact and self awareness I have no doubt you’ll do it again. 
---
I’m sure you’ll be back on the forums soon crying about something else while everyone laughs at you. Again.
---
I checked their levels. They're all 40 and probably spend 8 hours a day on the beta. Grouping with them wasn't going to be an option anyway. 
---
I could have said that, but that's the point of this thread. They're elitist jerks probably from PS and think doing the ABSOLUTE most with your class AT ALL times (as if it's a chore) is the optimal way to play. 
---
My response to them after I said that was literally, "If he can't hold hate, then it's a problem." as in, it's a problem and I'll swap.
---
500,000 to 1 million, easily. Probably 2 million.
---
According to the steam charts, Dota 2 has  around 800k+ players every day. GTA 5 100k. Path of Exile 100k. Civ 5, Skyrim, Terraria all in the tens of thousands. Elder Scrolls Online has around 30k.
---
Those games never had the drawing power of peak WoW. Maybe gaming has moved on, but I'm going to guess from stream views and even the number of subs here, there is going to be a lot of interest. Given the numbers for the games above, I definitely think there will be an enduring community.
---
What's with this vanilla.cz website that Google is promoting.  I keep accidently clicking on it because it is the first link.  Twin-head or something?  Even joanas guides links all go to it.  That is a change in the past week.
---
Yeah, you're right that tournaments could be organized by players themselves. On Stormscale EU, we actually did this once back in the day at in the Dire Maul arena, which was a lot of fun.
---
But without a proper system, it would also introduce the problems this system tried to solve. Griefing, no concurrent matches, no rewards, etc.
---
Except he never fought for threat at all. So yea, guess not.
---
OP may not be an elitist but boy you sure are a jerk.
---
already wants me to create a account im good trying to farm data and sell it
---
My build is agility and rockbiter scales better with crits.
---
Why would you want to stop striving?!
---
Onxe your character is completed delete him!
---
The difference between naxx gear and bloodvine set for example is large. But a leveling playing with 500 hp vs a 2k hp twink is an insane gear discrepancy.
---
Not to mention, without all your skills and talents, gear matters a lot more. And with high level enchants low level twinks get crazy high crit percentages and ap values.
---
You never know, you might like it.
---
I dont think normal pug groups are anything like high-end competitive
---
Phasing for the launch, then it will be removed. Few weeks tops.
---
I was thinking hybrid classes, but all hybrid specs (like healing/dps) would also be valid but probably more difficult. There are many ways to go about this.
---
It is hypothetical, but actually trying different things out would be interesting to see how things play out.
---
It’s vc
---
Not really. The difference between someone at lvl 18-19 in lvling gear and enchanted twinks is bigger than the difference between 60ies in postlvling gear working on prebis and someone in enchanted tier 3. Undergeared players have way more of a fighting chance at high lvls compared to lvling characters fighting twinks.
---
Yep,  I'm playing tank and will be kicking idiots and non team players when they show they aren't willing to try to be team players or learn
---
I hear what you are saying, but having raided on a private server all the way up untill Naxx, world buffs have never been such a big deal. We would always just buff before raid and then go and if we died we just carried on without buffs.
---
I'm sure he does, despite his clickbaity title. Thing is, I've played on private servers with and without them (most do a month without world buffs on each raid launch so it's made a bit more difficult), and I've experienced the differences first-hand. I don't particularly feel a desire to watch through a 22 minute video on a subject I'm already quite familiar with, and I assume if there were some new arguments in it, that they would've been brought up by users in this thread, but I have yet to see anything new.
---
twin-head is a private server that's been around a long time.  They have their own version of the WowHead DB.  I've found that theirs is really slow.
---
Personally, I like to use http://classicdb.ch
---
So my post gets removed for having a name of a private server in it, but this post is OK?
---
🤔
---
I roleplay. You should too!
---
Armor too, and a shape shift you can use to pop cc and keep casting
---
&gt;It can make lesser viable classes/specs more viable by making them able to compete on damage or healing.
---
It's the opposite. The best classes are good because they scale well. So the more buffs, gear, and stuff you add to the raid, the more OP the best classes will be compared to everyone else.
---
Let’s go boys and girls were almost there!!!
---
Tunadil and that party we don't have a confirmed time for. Seems weird that it'd be found through archaeology if it weren't ancient, but... They've done dumber.
---
On Paladins: it depends on your definition. Draenei vindicators have existed for *ages.* In Legion, we have a statue of Mara Fordragon, a "Clerist" of the First War. A Clerist would be a warrior capable of wielding divine power--but from most viewpoints, that's just a paladin. That implies being a paladin may be about being a part of an order, not JUST being a light-wielding warrior.
---
RIP. 
---
At least you will have the true classic experience lol
---
The gear list you are selecting from is ordered by EP, based on which set of EP values you select or create. If it isn't show you prot items, it's because you didn't value the protection stats high enough on the EP you are using.
---
OP i agree with you, World buffs make the game fun for high tier raiders. They can help improve their kill times as well as helping players level. I always loved getting Rallying Cry on my alts so that i could crush 2 hours of leveling there after with my god tier buff. Or being in Booty bay and getting hit by lightning and having the Zandalar buff for two hours that lasted through death. People that don't want world buffs aren't he hardcore players. They want to play casually and don't want to be in a guild that would therefor require them to have them. Which is totally fine, but just because you want to be casual doesn't mean you should take a mechanic that the classic wow enthusiasts have used over plenty of private servers. Remember this is all happening because of those "Hardcore Private Server" gamers. We have played that way since Nost, and if we want to play that way because that's what lets us enjoy vanilla what gives you the right to take that away from them? They should be allowed to have their main logged out days before their raid because they have a +10% darkmoon faire, songflower, roids, DMT buffs, rallying cry, ZG buff and WCB if that is their choice. Quit coming after the hardcore WoW enthusiasts because they want to play the game they want to.
---
So to maximize hunter it’s needed to melee?
---
That's hilarious.
---
It looks pretty standard.
---
The only thing I would personally change is taking 1 point in Efficiency (reduced mana cost of all shots and stings by 2%) versus the 1 point in Improved Hunter's Mark, which is only worth 3.3 RAP and will never mean the difference in a fight.
---
Others might debate about Deflection versus Humanoid Slaying and Clever Traps versus Savage Strikes, but it really depends on what kind of PVP you're doing.
---
Alright, I see. Do you want them removed entirely or restricted because of that though? Or are you fine with others being able to utilize them, if they want?
---
Definitely a common lie people might have told, but that doesnt mean it was a lie for everyone who said it.
---
I played a twink healer.  Even in twink gear it was almost impossible to actually kill anyone if they wanted to escape.  I was playing to keep the other players alive.
---
He never asked me. He simply stated. He never lost threat so I didn't consider it a big deal.
---
Yep this is the only exception. I will gladly open a portal at the end of a dungeon for free
---
Nice comment.
---
One piece pulled out of context and misrepresented... in the business we call that a strawman.
---
Perhaps backing this notorious quote and trying to put a positive spin on it was a poor direction to take.
---
I'm going to work backwards on your statements here. First I don't have vitriol for people getting what they want. I do think as a whole the "vanilla fanbase" has been rather douchey at times, and they have become increasingly douchey after the announcement. I can assure you "retail babies" was not coined by people playing retail prior to this announcement.
---
I'm not going to give a crash lesson in game theory, but your inability to apply a simply defined term, and reject it because of how it makes you feel, rather than apply rational thought to it... is a personal problem. Multiple people (5 or more) camping a singular spawn trying to tap it before the other 4 do, instead of grouping to complete the quest, is prisoner dilemma at work. This is not some anecdotal (potentially fictional) tale. I sat in the stress test at level cap and watched countless people repeat a similar behavior.
---
Now I will concede that perhaps these people are NOT true fans of classic, and may not represent players who will actually play to level cap once it goes live. I will also concede that a stress test (purposeful overcrowding) and a level cap of 5 creates an experience that may be inconsistent with what may happen on live. It is still worth noting, and having a discussion as to why players might behave that way, as it speaks directly against the age old argument that people were somehow MORE social in classic than they are in retail. I played vanilla, I witnessed firsthand some pretty narcissistic and codependent behaviors... very antisocial behaviors.
---
You didn't address any other of my points, and I'm not going to exhaustively repeat or clarify them here.
---
Suffice to say if there one thing you could or should be able to pull from my comments it's that the "classic fanbase" is NOT a singular voice. I am not now, nor have I ever been in opposition of servers running old expansions. Not everyone is as naive as some folks sound. I myself remember vanilla for ALL it's faults, and yet it holds a special place in my heart as do the people I played with at that time.
---
But if you cannot express yourself to communicate an opinion (the why is important) beyond, "That's my opinion and I'm entitled to it!" you should probably avoid discussion boards entirely. It isn't helpful, it isn't compelling, it isn't thought provoking, it definitely isn't controversial, and it isn't worth the time to type it, much less read it.
---
For twelve major patches blizzard never touched or tweaked world buffs in fact they added even more.
---
And cowboys, and redskins, eagles
---
Well really the entire NFC east
---
I got level 24 as a troll rogue as my first character. I deleted him and made an undead rogue. My friends never let me hear the end of it and outleveled me for a longtime before I caught back up. Man I hated the rear profile of trolls
---
Wow its been 20 days since i checked last.
---
Guess ill do that 3 more times...then 10 days later
---
Jokes on you I'm dead 
---
Oh wait.
---
Because the tank made a statement, had literally no trouble tanking and we cleared the dungeon with zero deaths and virtually no trouble at all? Care to explain what you mean?
---
To maximize a hunter, How much melee is needed?
---
Nhim literally says in his interview that blizzard had an internal, working copy of the original 1.12 client that they actually played and went through Scholo.. do you not remember that? Which means they have been working on it for quite some time, like ion said in the first ever interview.. which was translated to text by MMO champion and confirmed by a blue. Dude, just stop, you’re embarrassing yourself.
---
right.  on review, I got the metadata term from the nost comments on the issue, and blizzard confirmed the substance of it in the kotaku interview.
---
Now later they apparently said they had it, and as you say, that is a whole different debate.  They have no reason to ever admit they don't have 1.12 original metadata, and they well could have found it, too.
---
I don't recall outdoor normal mob nerfs in 2.3 - just xp changes, near-total elimination of outdoor elites, and mass dungeon changes/nerfs.
---
I'de like to have my alt 60 when BWL is on farm.
---
Except the player population has been steadily declining the whole time, there were DEFINITELY times (PBR was the most common) where people would transfer their twinks to PBR so they could play against those in other battelgroups.  This was definitely a thing and nobody was transferring non-twink 19s 29s 39s etc
---
I mean, sure that works.
---
But for progression you'd wanna have those buffs for bosses you're having issues with. And they're reaaaaaally potent lol.
---
I don't think seconds is a good measure. Should wait for x stack of sunders before attacking. For me (as a tank) I say wait for 1 sunder on trash mobs, 2 sunders on bosses. Sunder can miss/dodged/parried.
---
As far as I know this never happened with Nost, right? Seems kinda shitty to me to spread lies about a team that helped get the ball rolling on something we all wanted.
---
I disagree. PvP is a huge part of the game and people simply take advantage of that. You can gank and camp and it isn't griefing it isn't against the rules. People aren't being toxic assholes doing it, they're having fun.
---
And guess what, a lot of us on the other end find it fun, too. I suck at PvP. I'm basically a free honor kill without backup. I get ganked, or outnumbered, and even camped and I think it's hilarious. It becomes a game, a sort of challenge, to get away from them. When I'm done with that game but they aren't, I can find something else to do, no big deal.
---
I don't get frustrated just because I lose. What frustrates me is in, say, PvP when people are afraid of their pixel character's death animation and having to walk back from a GY so they don't engage. Or when people cap an AB flag then leave it completely unguarded to go DPS in the roads.
---
Fighting dirty and interfering with the opposite faction on a PvP server is perfectly fair play. It isn't toxic, it isn't griefing. It's okay to simply not enjoy it, but the people who do are not automatically toxic just because they don't share your opinion, and it isn't toxic for people to engage in intended gameplay mechanics just because you maybe rolled on the wrong server.
---
Different pets will perform differently, though it's not as complex as it was in vanilla. In the 1.12 patch that Classic is based on pets were at a "somewhat" normalized state. There's 2 main things to look for when choosing a pet.
---
1) Animal Type. Different pets get different abilties based on their animal type. For example, Boars get Charge, Cats get Prowl, Birds get Screech, etc.
---
Complete list of pet abilities for Classic: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php
---
2) Attack Speed. In 1.12 DPS for all pets of the same type is normalized. So your cat will do the same DPS as any other cat. However, different cats will have different attack speeds. Generally, a faster attack speed is preferred because it causes more spell pushback on casters in PvP.
---
Pet attack speeds in Classic: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php
---
As you can see, the fastest attack speed a pet can have is 1.0, and that speed is limited to only a few pets. The most popular of these is Broken Tooth, a cat located in the Badlands.
---
Other popular pets include the Boar (for charge), the ZG Bat (1.0 attack speed and constantly fies in opponent's face), Wind Serpent (high magical DPS for armored targets), and Wolf (AoE damage buff to party).
---
&gt;Name one class that has better gear options than you.
---
Mage. 
---
Dps warrior has no tier sets. And a lot of the good pieces are shared with other classes like rogues and hunters. Usually there are only a few pieces in an entire raid that are good for warriors. Mage for example doesn't have the best tier set, but it's still useable, then on top of that they have about as much gear to choose from as a fury warrior does in total.
---
Such a recurring theme in these posts. The tank had no trouble holding aggro, at any point, never. My build is focused around big crits because I'm stacking agility. Rockbiter scales better than flametongue. Had I almost died at any point, I would've swapped. I didn't. Reactionary play is a thing.
---
That all you got?  Haha you are a troll
---
Bro I remember Pizza Hut, I wasnt in that bracket but I enjoyed Pizza's input on the old twink forums
---
Is there a video out there of this? Sounds hilarious
---
Yeeep, planning to heal but I'll be doing the same thing. Like things are quick enough in classic for it to be a pain but not too frustrating.
---
But when you have a potentially multi-hour dungeon, like, I'm not going to suffer for that long to carry someone who can't do basic shit through it the whole time.
---
explain?
---
And kind of sad. A level 24 alchemy consumable beating out a level 60 class consumable by a significant margin (again, with enough preparation)? Ouch.
---
Despite those, the questing in TBC was hands down better than anything else. It overshadowed all the other crap.
---
Link it then.
---
Sorry, I only read the first sentence. I wasn't a second tank, I never tanked a mob and the tank never lost aggro. I was third in dps where I should have been because the other players were 2-3 levels higher than me.
---
Jesus Christ

Time = better raid gear which = a far more enjoyable time absolutely wrecking people who can't raid.
