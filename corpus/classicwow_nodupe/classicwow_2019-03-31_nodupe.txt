Could you link your chair? I'm just super curious now
---
---
---
Blizz is giving BS excuses and the only people who support it just want an easy path to server first Rag? Lol you really are delusional.
---
What class you rolling ?1
---
On the demo, people reported that when summoning a new demon, the demon shouldn't disappear before the new demon was summoned and should instead, remain stunned until the summon is complete (like on retail).
---

---
The dev's confirmed that the way it worked on the beta was accurate to the 2004 version and that the playerbase was wrong because they compared private servers to the demo.
---
Lol it wouldn’t be Classic without people like you. :)
---
Valid, I wont argue that one, I will say though that I expected to be downvoted to oblivion if that were the case
---
Are you talking about hybrid as in elemental enhance? If so I’m highly considering that as well, get all of the good elemental stuff and get 2h weapons and 1sec ghost wolf and grounding totem cooldown stuff from enhance. Straight up battlemage, bump the heals
---
13 - 14 is when I usually did RFC
---
Honestly I think most guilds will be totally open to having 1 or 2 enh shaman.
---
Having a dedicated set of totem twisters that literally can do 80% or better the dps of a "true" dps spec with literally stormstike is nothing to balk at.
---
The utility you get in having someone who's job it is to press 1 or 2 buttons every 15 seconds and the rest of the time be setting buffs and dedicated to support is actually a lot more useful than epeen meter whores will let on.

It's got those weird ass pillow things that really help with posture. 
---
Most likely male undead rogue, maaaaaybe warlock.
---
"oMg a giiiiiiRlLlll!!"
---
I agree with this, and if this is contrary to no changes then come along after week 1 and experience your authentic vanilla experience. But honestly the number of players on day 1 will be like 10x the number of players on any day after day 30. Sharding is unfortunately necessary imo
---
Mannnn. Horde is going to be so over saturated with Rogues 
---
Was this before you starred in Orange is the new black?
---
Jesus, some badass PM’d me asking me to take this down cuz its “mockful” and “retarted”. Then he said “for the horde” and threatened to report this post for racism. 
---
And BAM you’re an art critic 
---
I'm ready to take out my vacation the second I know the date, haha
---
Fake news, OP is an ally scum trying to make horde look bad.
---
Are undead rogues bad?
---
While you should definitely give Classic a go I do fear that if the only appeal of the game was 2 hours of starting zones full of players then perhaps your experience was always going to be brief.
---
Balance, obviously :)
---
Total Annihilation is my favorite Rogue Movie.
---
Deadmines or dire maul?
---
Nah, there definitely was auto-wanding.
---
Undead Rogue is the typical "edgy tryhard" combo. Probably one of the most played class/race combinations in Vanilla, based on what I remember
---
Does it make bad? Or why is he trying to insult someone saying theyre probably rolling one? And I dont think it is the most played class/race combo.
---
But it's expensive 
---
Thanks for your input!
---
Yea that too, running way to fast on accident it was a passive after all! It would be cool to see it come back in some form, it'd be kind of fun to run around really speedy
---
Classic!
---
Jealous, when I went to boarding school we didn't even have internet. Granted this was in a 3rd world country
---
Hey man, I thought a big monitor was what I wanted too, and I honestly hate it now, it’s absolutely huge, to the point where I think it makes me worse in competitive games, and it’s really hard to move around.
---
My recommendation is 24 - 27 inches, but also you can just go into a store and see the monitor in person to see if you like it, or you can draw it out on paper, it’s the easiest thing imo to go out and visually see before purchasing.
---
Nothing like us bigbrained players today.
---
I’m in a similar situation.  My two close friends are dead set on horde for classic.  I prefer alliance, but will be going horde this time around.
---
Heh no tube screen.....casual 
---
I'm was a bit of a hoarder back then. 15 years it's worse "you're overcombered" is my middle name
---
Sadly she is no longer with us. Nala was nearly 14 years old when she crossed the bridge in 2015. 
---
I guess you won't be playing on launch then
---
Yikes
---
Filthy Blood Elf scum!  The person I may play with wants to be a shaman so therein lies the issue with persuading them.
---
I don’t think he’s lying, 
---
Someone messaged me something like that too too after I made a post here. 
---
Honestly, I couldn’t remember if this was tbc or vanilla. 
---
I hoard a lot of WoW items, they just all go in my bank!
---
You'll never catch me skipping the Linken's sword chain on any character.
---
Yeah, that may be what I do myself in the end.  :)
---
I may also try doing an alt on the opposite faction so I’ll just have to see what ends up working out.  Thanks!
---
Hahaha 
---
Oh man, when I was 13 i think, I used to play tibia and faked being a girl for protection and free stuff. It worked for about a year, when friends and I decided to come clean. Holy shit did things escalate. Everyone hated us, we got slaughtered and hunted down everywhere on the server.
---
We even did manage to fool other actual girls playing. 
---
It was a lot of fun though, wouldn't work anymore because everyone now has voice chat and isn't as innocent and believe as much as they did back then.
---
Can someone make pic of the captain America, Avengers assemble with Thor’s hammer then photoshop it with Thrall saying Meme specs Assemble!?!?
---
Going to be making a bunch of 35 alch alts and mining/herb on the main if I can find a working macro or mining/alch and skinning.
---
Me too, instantly transported me back in time 10 years
---
Not at all, i used to main Undead Rogue back in Classic, back when it was the “edgelord” thing to do.
---
The guy in the white Tshirt is definitely saying something inappropriate in this thumbnail.
---
I feel you on that.  Choices choices!
---
That’s Chaotic good no?
---
Nice one lol. There are people that still try to pull the "no mic" card, but it fools a lot less people.
---
Can we please bring back the keyring from TBC? 
---
Maybe I should've stated that it's my favorite purely because of how nostalgic it is for me.
---
Blizz giving BS excuses is far from delusional. “You think you do but you dont”, “We don’t have the code anymore”, “Would be too much work to make Classic WoW happen” these were all excuses given by Blizzard that turned out to be fallacies....
---
The Rag theory is delusional, but so is thinking introducing one of the most hated systems in WoW history is going to prevent some inevitable mass  exodus event if otherwise left out. 
---
Some servers are going to be low pop and some with ques longer than the character list of other servers. Its going to happen, I know a lot of people are scared of either of those extremes, but sharding isnt going to be the magic safety net to put your mind at rest.
---
this pic looks like a 3d render for some reason
---
Username is on-point.
---
I distinctly remember picking up the pamphlet too. The human, the troll, an orc and a tauren? I think, on a bridge in STV with other jungle trolls watching them from the bushes. I was big in to the WC universe and I always regret never downloading the second half of the Rexxar campaign from the Blizzard site. If I remember correctly this was the trailer on the WC3 disc. I think? I'm not sure.

Hey OP i found the guy who PMed you

You look like a warlock and that's coming from a warlock. Hunched over ready to farm shards for the boys

Legend says he’s still wearing a hate backwards and single to this very day.

Will still work fine but the price must be much lower.

In Vanilla, I was a SPriest in PVE, but sometimes, i loved switching for a holy DPS build.

Thanks!

It's possible to make stuff like kickbot nonfunctional without restricting APIs entirely to modern API though. None of the addons I've mentioned can be recreated using only the modern API, except for AutoBar and maybe LazyPig to some extend, but it wouldn't really make any sense because they wouldn't have the features that makes them "smart".
---
I know the modern API/macro system is flexible and its possible to make macros with it to kinda achieve the same thing, but it's still not 100% the same and it obviously doesn't feel as fluent because ye... the "automation" is gone. 
---
But hey i'm all for the #nochanges too even though it might seem hypocritical to say that and then suggest something that isn't how it used to be, but I mean, if we can't have original APIs then why can't we have other nice things instead. To me it's just as gamebreaking that casters can shoot through objects and stuff as someone who is botting or scripting. Thats why a brought it up. 
---
Ok i was just terrible then lol
---
I distinctly remember wands being on auto on my warlock. I can't tell you if it was like that for warriors or rogues using a bow.
---
Are you the normal looking chick or one of the neckbeards?
---
RIP Nala.
---
[removed]
---
If you are with a group of people who know what they are doing/their class, you're fine at 13-14 for sure
---
It was the same for other classes
---
The fact that you got buried for pointing out this out is so fucking ironic.
---
Of course Stephen King would play warlock
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/

in this post you can get quite a good read on the class distribution by adding all the races for the faction
---
I was going to point out that at least 10 people were offended already. But they might have been offended further. Offended inception. 
---
Thank you so much 
---
You dismiss the playtime he managed to get, while simultaneously claiming you can do it faster and have a better route. Lmao this guy...
---
I don't think it will be that bad, but yes...first come, first serve.
---
Has a much larger impact on gameplay that anything else. 
---
Gotta get DAT "MUB BBBBLIZZLIKE" experience!

It was changed in 1.5, so I imagine it will have spell power if they are only looking at changes to 1.10 items.

I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
Then all that is left is embracing the glory of the horde. Lok'tar, brother.
---
Certain pservers I have played on have done it exactly that way (generating threat when renewing the buff on people who already had it). I can pm you the names so you can fact check me if you want but I didn’t make it up. 
---
If it wasn’t like that in retail vanilla and won’t be like that in classic, so be it, my bad, thanks for correcting.
---
I also found the real values: 55 threat per person for battle shout, 43 per mob for demo shout
---
So a full 5 man bloodraged battle shout can actually do a shitload of threat. With 5 in a party vs 5 mobs that’s like a sunder on all of them with BRage+ BS. 
---
Guess demo shout will be the more spammable one on classic, OP. Best used when large groups of weaker mobs start getting aggro peeled away by the weak ApE threat of healer’s individual healing spells. In this case demo shout can peel some of those mobs back to you, but you shouldn’t rely on it for serious situations.
---
Yeah, Alliance gankers are all Nelf Hunters. 
---
June 25th
---
it does, only trolls and mqg though
---
Mages used spirit wands as part of their evocation weapon set.
---
Man, what a mess.
---
Aint that people were offended. It's that the comment misunderstood why the jokes were removed and so it made no sense as a response. 
---
OMG how had I forgotten about Illegal Danish?! Such great times.
---
The game has been rated teen for its entire existence. The jokes were removed so that they could appeal to a younger crowd. Jokes that were sexual in nature or promoted violence were removed. 
---
This makes sense from a business perspective. 
---
And the animation made you have both bread and jug in your hand eat / drink at the same time.
---
Do you still have hair ?
---
Lol, and imagine the tauren being enlarged?  Too funny.
---
trolls and mqg?
---
I disagree. It's easier for me to RP a different race since their culture and personalities are usually exaggerated to set them apart from humans.
---
What if they took the class balancing from BC and released new classic content (dungeons and raids) to provide gears for other specs?
---
&gt; and then the game crashes and they have to wait another 8 hours.
---
servers nowadays have protection against this
---
F

krappa

Drop the racial voice and It'd be great.

Yknow what still has me butthurt? There was a big wind/rainstorm on a tuesday in 05’ in early september and school got cancelled for the day. I couldn’t log in til like 2PM due to maintenance.

For the first few weeks at least there’s going to be a shit ton of big streamers. Lots of new people are going to try it, but many of the big streamers were old school wow players like shroud and soda.
---
Lmao, Copperfield. You guys see the video about him?
---
Man, don't even bother lol.  The guy is not well.  He just repeats himself and is completely unresponsive to any counter argument you'll present.  
---
Fury warrior or rogue?
---
From my understanding they are both very nice, but I love to tank. But do I love tanking as much as I love stealth? 
---
What would be better in your opinions and which do you think there will be more of around when classic comes
---
They day we get a release date I'm taking a week's vacation. Just waiting for it
---
It will be interesting seeing the starting zones when Classic launches. We didn't have streamers back then with 30K live viewers. It was funny seeing all the streamer groupies following the streamers around in the demo. How are the streamers going to complete the starter quests when every mob is getting tagged by the trolls? That will be entertaining for sure. 
---
It literally was plain as day, you mustard tiger.
---
Hopefully there are more guilds with the same mindset as ours, just look for some actual vanilla player guilds and we usually think alike :)
---
I’m sure when we get a release date and it gets closer, recruiting will happen (ours included!)
---
We will be alliance, on a pvp server, Toronto(Canada) Timezone :).   I’ll do a post in a few weeks
---
Ah good 'ol hand lotion in the back there. Gotta keep them hands slick and smooth for fast reactions! 
---
Did you mean to post on your other account?
---
It's worth mentioning healers can get away with being lower level more easily than the tank.
---
My dad and I used to try to log each other in right before we'd get off work and school because of how brutal the queue times were. There were straight days where we didn't get to play because of them of the DC's or the servers just going down for days. How people forget all the bad is beyond me
---
It was super broken and totally awesome 
---
You literally are the one who was repeating yourself so lol. You were unresponsive to any arguments. I showed you ways to show sarcasm easily and you kept going "NAHUH IT WAS OBVIOUS". 
---
also dude you "two" post exactly the same. Keep sockpuppeting.
---
Feels good man 
---
No.... :( But seriously. Just accept it. Even if it's hard
---
this is legit the first one of these i've seen that is like, yer that kid is a real WoW player.
---
How so?
---
"FUCKING FUCK"
---
He touched my ass!
---
For the lock in his leveling spec I would take points out of the +stam -spirt talent and take improved healthstone. The stam increase won't help you as much because you don't have gear and losing spirit will hurt the improved drain soul talent. Having that little extra health on the stone would be more useful.
---
Definitely still take.spirit tap. Definitely go full affliction.
---
Dots are.more efficient and with his heals , you can kite dot 4-5 mobs. He should probably look into holy Nova as well to help finish aoe big pulls. Spirit tap too good not for him to take hell just have to fight for last hits
---
You definitely want corruption, supression and improved life tap when leveling.The one you linked is not a very good tbh, your voidwalker is already tanky, especially with a priest buff. And mobs will die so fast from your dots anyway. Spamming shadowbolt will make you go oom fast and will also pull aggro of the mobs. The priest looks good but for u something like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Iy0bqRbkq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Iy0bqRbkq) and the rest after that is up to you, I would personally put the next 21 points into demo. then switch to sm ruin at 60. gl !
---
In sunwell I recall hearing that nihilum sat their all mages for some bosses and keeping them outside for int buff / table.
---
you can really leverage your leveling speed and gold with a priest by buying wands
---
That terrible Photoshop feeling
---
Reminder that Skyrim came out in 2011 and we're all old as hell.
---
Hey I have that laptop sitting in my closet collecting dust now. Has like a 260m gtx
---
Priest needs to spec into renew, Mana while casting... The are huge for continuing the train
---
Do go on 
---
I actually laughed
---
Here's mine: think about how you will farm gold. Immediately.
---
I don't think he's mocking the feedback itself so much as he is mocking the *tone* and misplaced sense of urgency.  From the information we have, Classic will already be closer to Vanilla than most pserves were and most pservers were already *close enough* for most players. Some people are making mountains out of molehills.
---
Unless something goes massively sideways between now and launch I think it's time to just relax and be happy (and get you PTO ready),
---
Sounds decent for pvp 
---
Not available at the beginning, so I scrap together my pennies for an Executioner's Cleaver.

---
&gt;It's possible to make stuff like kickbot nonfunctional without restricting APIs entirely to modern API though.
---
How would you block that without also blocking automation/smart macros you seem to be after? They both rely on CastSpellByName(). (or secure button attributes for retail) The features you seem to be after have a side effect of that they allow other people to create smart buttons that play the entire game for them spamming one button.
---
&gt; None of the addons I've mentioned can be recreated using only the modern API,
---
Yes they can. They just have to be initialized out of combat first. Trinketmenu is even updated for Legion on curse. (autoqueue will require extra buttons presses though)
---
Isn't ItemRack just an equipment manager? You can do that with macros aswell and certainly with an addon.
---
&gt;if we can't have original APIs then why can't we have other nice things instead. To me it's just as gamebreaking that casters can shoot through objects and stuff as someone who is botting or scripting. Thats why a brought it up.
---
They're creating Vanilla, not Vanilla remastered. The api is an exception as they had to use the modern client for reasons that have already been explained multiple times.
---
Source?
---
Hailing back to the ol' Diablo 2 enchant sorceress. 
---
I'll be playing on my very average, full of crap laptop that I use for work. It runs pservers absolutely fine. I got the thing for like £300 about 2 years ago.
---
No man, I was re-iterating what the other guy was saying because you can't seem to get it through your head.  But please do keep chasing the shadows in your troubled mind.
---
Herb/alch is never a bad idea.
---
they added auto-wanding later in vanilla, it wasn't there at launch
---
Highly overpopulated. the pirate server community has started calling anything under 5k online dead. Original caps were 2500-3k (What the game was designed for)
---
Consider for a second that you're wrong and we're two different people.  Would that make you feel silly?
---
Link? 
---
It's one of the few ways to address overcrowding that doesn't massively impact gameplay. All the alternatives (more realms, login queues, dynamic/increased respawns) have severe gameplay implications.
---
I honestly don't have a problem with sharding. If it's done properly you won't notice it at all. If you want to group with friends... then group with friends. It should be completely seamless.
---
Get a mouse with a few extra buttons on it, works like a charm. I got one of Amazon for about £6.00 
---
That was 2 years ago and it still works fine :)
---
The fact you still can't admit that your wrong and resort to claiming it was sarcasm is complete retardation.
---
Someone flat out asks you if your serious and your response is:
---
&gt;Yes, absolutely.  
---
There is absolutely NO SARCASM TO BE DETECTED.
---
But what ever keep being an asshole. Maybe it does you some good by getting your dick hard or what ever.
---
Is this a joke? Do you really care about this?
---
It may be due to the violent nature of the joke as opposed to the weed reference. “Promoting genocide” if someone really wanted to push it. 
---
It is, but very gear dependant. Even with Shadow Trance, Ruin-less shadowbolts and no Shadowburn make for terrible burst damage.
---
1h shield superior for hybrid
---
Ahh yes the "Im not going to continue attacking you and now im going to use plea to popularity"
---
Hell its a super weak plea to popularity too when its "2" people which may very well be one.
---
Just fuck off.
---
A true shame they didn't use different hands. The animation of one hand pouring a jug while the other cramming it with a loaf would have been amazing.
---
One of my best friends died almost 3 years ago from Leukemia. He and I both played WoW religiously and had many memories together. The two things we did together that I miss most is watching Top Gear and playing WoW together. I wish he would have had the chance to play again. 
---
Rest In Peace Vince, I'll see you again someday.
---
&gt; Shard all 1-20 zones for the first week. After that pure vanilla.
---
I'll bet half the people who roll toons on classic servers won't make it past 20 anyway, but I'm also guessing the tourists will be dribbling in for more than a week. I agree with the level range, but I think instead of a set time we should just let Blizzard keep an eye on the numbers ad turn it off when it isn't needed.
---
Didnt they add loading screen tips later on in classic? I remember logging on one day (and i had a shitty computer so it took about 10 minutes to log in) and I saw one and read it and felt like i havent seen them there before that.
---
Kind of a bitter sweet truth.
---
If you're a DPS shaman or paladin or any other "meme spec" in your heart play it. Don't pretend to be a Warlock or a Warrior. You'll find people to raid/PvP with. If you try and dismiss it and choose a "viable" spec you're going to get burnt out and quit. Genuinely just don't beat around the bush and play what you know you want to, fearless of how people see you. I know I will.
---
&gt; The way Blizzards server tech works now accounts for sharding, so the game actually has a harder time handling lots of players in one area than it did back in Vanilla.
---
Really? Well crap. I was hoping the improved hardware would make massive world PvP possible...
---
The good news is shadow priests melt faces at 60 in pvp and u can heal as a shadow priest in dungeons until at least 50. The bad news is at 60 switching from heals to shadow will soon cost u 50 gold a pop
---
Yes, don’t worry you’ll wreck people if you play it well.
---
Saving 50 mana every 1.5 seconds equates to ~83mp5 per item.
---
Me and 4 friends did this when the Boulderfist EU server opened in vanilla. It was a lot of fun, it wasn't super fast but we all ended up in a raiding guild that was first to kill Rag so you really won't be that far behind other people. 
---
There will be times where you'll have to break from it to fill some levels out with questing and grinding to get to the next dungeon.
---
Grinding and having to eat after every mob on my warrior. Having to hamstring and run because I accidentally aggroed a second mob. Still loved every minute of it
---
You seem upset.  And you also don't seem to know what the words you are using mean.  Take a deep breath my dude.
---
Ok thank god.   
---
That name made me lose it.
---
Hard truth: If you make an ass out of yourself during every interaction with other players you're going to have a BAD time.     
---
That one guy you insulted during leveling because he was faster to a herb? He might just remember that insult and tell his guild/friends.     +
---
Ninja-looted stuff during a dungeon run while levelling because that one item would really help you while leveling? You might've just pissed of four people and all their friends + anyone they might tell about it.
---
**Reputation mattered.** There is a chance that one could get away with ninja-looting once or twice, but mess around too often and people WILL avoid grouping with you and won't invite you into their guilds. Officers in your guild will hear complains about you from other people on your server, and if they value their reputation they will remove you from the guild.
---
Couldn't agree more. Just have fun. People often speak broadly about "what guilds are looking for" okay, while that may be true that's a very general statement for a smaller percentage of people that play. Not everyone is going to have the time or want to be competitive.
---
My irl friend had a rank 13 shadow priest that totally rekt nerds. Couldn’t kill my arms warrior tho :D
---
Just a few suicides, no big deal.
---
My first character was a warrior idk if I can do it again man hahaha
---
But like, you're 100% wrong.  Have you even tried to consider the point I made about context and the inherent absurdity of saying 'absolutely', which would immediately suggest it was a tongue-in-cheek comment?  I don't have these sorts of problems communicating sarcasm to anyone else.
---
I also said I was good with agreeing to disagree like three hours ago, but you keep replying to every post, saying things you've already said and coming up with conspiracy theories.
---
&gt; They do actually stop world pvp now if it causes stability issues too I guess.
---
Now that is just messed up. This is supposed to be a *Massively* Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game.

I prefer the second linked talent tree, but wouldn't you want to stack improved imp before demonic embrace? Improved Blood Pact for the whole party right? The party also likes health stones when leveling. Also in the first linked talent tree why would you roll improved curse of exhaustion? I played on a PVE server so I'm assuming that is some kind of PVP build. I totally agree with SM/Ruin at 60 though for sure. 
---
Yeah but warcraft has a good deal of that already
---
What part of there server tech or netcode is making it suck with large groups? There are routinely hundreds of people around the AH on pservers and they run smoother than silk on presumably much cheaper hardware.
---
not the ones that were released on launch day, those were shitty grey versions
---
the green ones you know are updated versions
---
True.

berserking (troll racial) and mind quickening gem (mage trinket). they reduce casting speed and collecting a herb is considered a cast.

Boss: No. I know you're going to be playing that dumb video game. You're not taking a week off for it.
---
Me: You landlubbers are tougher than I thought. I'll have to improvise!
---
Me: *Takes off name tag, drops it, and leaves store.*
---
Im gonna play it no matter what. Always hated to sub but would still do it just for classic
---
If 15 a month is an issue you should probably stick to pservers.
---
I was specifically talking about the time reduction baked into the Cultivation racial.
---
Absolutely 100%. Thankfully it goes both ways and you can become a really respected member of the community, but you gotta believe that if you act like a jerk nobody's going to want to play with you.
---
Gross.
---
Hope you feel good after getting this off your chest now dude. 
---
Hard to imagine how it could work. Tbc classes and talents are balanced around extra talents, they’re a mess at lvl 60, and would totally wreck all the current vanilla balance present in raids. It’s very hard to add new content to a game that already has 4 raid tiers. It’s going to completely invalidate some content or not be worth doing for others.  
---
  
---
There’s a very good reason tbc added 10 levels and a gear reset. The gear imbalance already in vanilla with naxx was already at a maximum. You can’t expect people to run MC forever. Calling it done and resetting is really the only option.
---
Launch is a huge server event with its own winners and losers. To me it is fun because i know ill be playing in a month anyway. Blizzard is putting in sharding to control the "single player" experience. Retail is living proof that catering to the single player audience in a MMORPG is not a winning strategy. 
---
More important the authentic Vanilla experience was not catering to the single player audience. 
---
Blizzard is probably too scared of not getting ANY of the single players from retail in Classic. Also MMORPG reviews will just judge a 10.000hour long game on the first 2hours of gameplay on launch day -.-
---
I say to Blizzard fook it just launch Classic without any modification. It would show that you have some balls. You would gain my respect again.  
---
That photoshop is so bad it's perfect.
---
I would try this while leveling.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bbRZfbhz
---
You’re about to violate a rule lol 
---
This reads like a copypasta lol 
---
Naw they just changed it. Now it has a line about adding them on Bnet.
---
Where’s the update!?
---
The fem Draenei talk about beating gnomes to death.
---
I’ll probably just buy a year sub off the bat so it’s a little cheaper than the 15 per month. I plan on playing Classic a lot so I don’t mind paying for something that I’m going to be using a lot. You don’t have to play the current game it’s just there as an added bonus essentially if you want. 
---
You number your wives?
---
[Green Whelp Armor](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7375) is amazing for lower level BGs
---
This. I would like to remind everyone WoD release was so bad, you had to grind to level. The horde couldnt do the siege quest because a bunch of shit broke thanks to all the players. It was so bad Phasing itself broke with entire phases being unacessable to the point people couldnt do anything. And good luck not getting loading screen looped trying to enter a garrison.
---
&gt;  You shouldn't have to lose points for something nobody wants
---
The problem is that you end up with collusion, for example all of the Hunters decide on a order in which they'll get a certain item, so only 1 Hunter puts in each time it drops and none of them have to spend DKP, which can be saved to outbid items that benefit multiple classes.
---
DKP is always abusable in some way. That's why the best guilds tend to go with some sort of loot council. That way a group of dedicated players can distribute loot in a way that benefits the guild as a whole and push progression, as opposed to handing out loot based on an arbitrary number system that becomes a game within itself.
---
sadly yet another shitguide. improved renew lulz.
---
Is it so disturbing for you mate?
---
Did you read the part where it says may or may not be required? If you’re MT healing and no one else is specced into it then yeah it might be required. Bye Felicia.
---
Like they have explained, classic is not its own game per-say.. hence why they don't even consider it a frontrun release (even though there will be millions playing it on launch). It's pretty much just a side game you get when you buy retail WoW, almost like a DLC.. you need the main game to play it.
---
Thanks for filling us in, jerk.
---
I prefer the goofy everything in one go animation. More relatable.
---
I'd recommend Kargoz on youtube. 
---
ok, it didnt read like that, but nvm then.
---
You will melt faces as a Shadow Priest in PvP.
---
I don’t know why you got downvoted.    
---
I’ve always played Tauren (shaman and warrior) [my two vanilla characters that I still have] {I have no interest in playing anything else}  so I’ve never had to face orcs and undead. I can only imagine the pain alliance have to contend with. 
---
* Loot everything and vendor it. 
---
* Mail anything worth selling on the AH to your bank alt.
---
*  Don't spend gold on spells unless you need them. 
---
* Don't buy anything from the AH except for your starting wand and quest items.
---
As long as you follow these rules you will be able to afford your mount. Warlocks get a free mount anyway.
---
Tailoring is recommended for all warlocks because of the BoP Robe of the void and Bloodvine set. It's also a decent way to make money by crafting bags, gear and mooncloth.
---
Engineering is good, mostly for PvP, because it has a lot of exclusive BoP items.  Gathering Professions are good for money. My plan for warlock profs is Tailoring/Herbing until I have a few thousand gold, then drop herb for engineering.
---
Those streamers have nothing to do with vanilla. 
---
Humans dont have to spend every waking second as a rotting corpse for the rest of their existance, after which hell awaits
---
They never were going to give classic a separate sub option, it be competing with themselves.
---
this is the best case scenario for both sides, be glad they didn't up the subscription fee from $15 to $20 with the addition of classic.
---
You are getting classic and retail access for $15 a month that is solid value.
---
Immolate, agony, corruption, tap, wand = life!
---
true, true. just my personal experiences here but for me at least legion launch went super smooth, i and a bunch of other people were standing in dalaran (where the quest chain starts) and we ported over smoothly more or less. 
---
bfa i think i had a problem where the servers were down for me and some other people but up for others, but that didn't seem to last more than an hour.
---
still, that's probably quite a bit different than classic which i think most will check out even if they don't stick with it, AND legion/bfa was designed to share every mob and quest item, classic isn't. so i think a limited form of launch sharding is fine and probably necessary
---
Harsh truth: You can level 1-60 and never see a BoE epic and/or 3 or less BoE blues. Pserver drop rates seem to be incredibly flawed/skewed.
---
Well yeah you only bust out the 2h vs squishy targets, keep spell power weapon and shield out but bust out neretzek the blood drinker on a mage lock priest or Druid and just violate. The life steal proc is increased by spell damage as well so potentially multiple procs of that on top of a wind fury proc is just joocy
---
Warlock mount will not be available during the release of classic due to DM not being available.
---
I feel the same, Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK was my consideration of golden gaming era for me . 
---
Well first off Warlocks get a free mount so you save a ton of gold right there. In vanilla I mained a Human Warlock with Herbalism and Tailoring. It is not the most synergistic combo of professions and it only really helped in the expansion where herbalism provided healing. It was a gathering profession though and I made some gold from it. Tailoring is a money sink. I would only roll Tailoring if you have a generous guild that can help you with some of the expensive mats and patterns. The only perk I liked about tailoring was the DPS increase from the embroidery. You are probably better off with mining and engineering for the DPS increase, but herbalism and enchanting would probably also make a lot of gold too.  
---
sorting lock bags aka 4 bags of shards.
---
👌
---
You only get 10 character slots. So unless you want to do it on every single server for some reason it shouldn’t take more than 5-10 minutes. 
---
I tried a server fresh launch before and names go FAST dude. FAST. I’m talking all the obvious ones were gone in 2 minutes. Even xxlegolasxx!
---
So sharding in northern barrens but not southern? You know they are the same zone in vanilla right?
---
Came here for this comment.
---
To be honest if they mess up the classic server so bad I don’t want to play they are still getting raided. Probably by a level one called “NOCHANGES” because I like most people wont ever play retail again. So if they screw this up who cares, ban away at least we can make our point.
---
If a rank 13 spriest can’t kill a warrior they need to find a new hobby.
---
Glad to see you looking into this so thoroughly.
---
Unfortunately for you, this could also be effected by many other variables. Mob armour, armour penetration formulae and implementation, etc.
---
Additionally, my comment is broader than just armour and armour penetration, pservers have many things completely wrong, as directly addressed in blue posts, by blizzard. 
---
https://youtu.be/O8s3XiaIbHY - good breakdown on just some of the issues.
---
This includes mob values and abilities, basic mechanics, etc. etc. all of which will change the balance of DPS.
---
If you find old videos, take a look at DPS charts. You'll find that average warriors were behind mages and at best on par with rogues. I'd expect classic to be more inline with Vanilla than it is on pservers.
---
Sweet guide, I love this kind of theorycrafting stuff. Some things I noticed:
---
The damage per rage comparison chart seems off. Execute should be constant dmg/rage yet it somehow does worse in the chart as attack power goes up. I think you plotted the execute(rage) function there somehow. Also either the axis are mislabeled or wrong way round, I'd rather have AP on x and dmg/rage on y.
---
Iirc cleave DOES have increased threat, according to [https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/23110-aoe-threat-generation/](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/23110-aoe-threat-generation/) 130 split between mobs vs 196 of heroic strike. No idea if those numbers are correct but I do vaguely remember single target cleave not really being a thing for that reason.
---
A chart that shows weapon skills effect to overall white damage instead of just glancing blows would be interesting. This isn't static as hit and crit chance should affect it, and especially two handed weapons should get less relative benefit from weapon skill. 
---
Very minor but what you call flurry uptime is the chance of having flurry active on any given weapon swing. If 50% of swings have flurry it has less than 50% uptime since those swings take less time than the non-flurried ones. 
---
I hope you keep working on this, I'll try to check all the formulas and hopefully new versions in case I can find any errors or stuff I'd like see added.
---
maybe he doesn't have hands 
---
If you are planning to kill AQ40-Naxx content you will need to individually farm *thousands* of gold worth of consumables. If farming gold for an epic mount or something like devilsaur armor turn you off maybe set your raid ceiling goals at BWL.
---
In low res zones with low res mounts fighting low res enemies
---
But randomly hi res themselves
---
Can you imagine how weird it would look?
---
I have no idea what this is, OP.  Actual WC3 mod?  Chinese rip-off?
---
How’s your shoulders doing these days? That posture tho.
---
Did you guys live in a warehouse?
---
The ol’ science textbook mousepad 
---
I didn’t even make it to dalaran. I got ported every time to Karazan and fell to my death. I needed to be portald. 
---
I grinded crabs on a beach in Westfall because some guide said it was the most efficient XP grind and I had to catch up to my friends level asap. I totally regret that time spent and should have been completing all Westfall quests and doing Dungeons instead. Some of the best leveling quests for early blues were in Stormwind. Duskwood was also an amazing experience to quest through. I know everyone wants to ding 60 asap, but please take my advice and don't grind specific mobs for it. 
---
If you're leveling a mage, you will spend more time drinking than playing the game.
---
It's worth it, because Mages are one of the God classes at 60 (Mage/Warrior) but holy shit is Mage boring to level.
---
I feel bad for all the comments op gets/is going to get
---
Unfortunately it's pretty difficult to get until 35ish unless you get help. From what I remember it wasn't that much better than anything else at around 36, and dungeons were easier to farm. 
---
Get my Lock to 60 asap.  Will take like a week off from work to help with that.
---
Then pvp my heart out.  
---
Harsh Truth: Druid forms, Warrior stances, Rogue Lock Picking, Shaman Totems AND the spells linked to them. All of these require quest chains to complete. Some aren’t terrible and some will have you going back and forth across Durotan and the Eastern Kingdoms to complete. 
---
I doubt it. They've been pretty clear they're going to use 1.12 data. 
---
mon*
---
Aye true and honestly the “meme” specs can still do the job. Just not as easily. Make friends, join guilds that are willing to work with you. Don’t play something you hate. 
---
Wow that's a nice healing off-hand
---
The sound of pure fun, a long distance memory in the gaming scene
---
oof that's rough. i think once they flipped the switch i had the option to talk to khadgar and start the teleport process and then i ended up in the broken isles?
---
To be fair, ganking lowbies doesn't mean you can't take fair fights, you just don't feel like it :)
---
Seize the ass touched!
---
fake, it has a 3D monitor 
---
aaaaaand, wow classic can't be played by a dog, only retail can
---
The obsession with streamers is annoying at best and fucking embarrassing at worst
---
Obviously no one knows yet but it is a safe assumption based on 20 years of blizzard releases that there will be a 2 month beta where all the main addons get done before release. 
---
Yep.
---
I miss knowing people on my server
---
You can slow grind to rank 10 and then you have to no life 3-4 weeks of top bracket from there. You need to be top of your faction to make good progress past rank 10 because of how bad the decay is (-20% of your ranking points every week - rank 12 is 50.000 ranking points - in the top bracket you get 12.000-13.000 ranking points a week).
---
20/31/0 if you don't need the +hit.
---
2/31/18 if you do.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Personally,  I like 7/31/13.  Clever traps is nice for 5mans and crazy hunter v. world stuff.
---
Hard truth: It takes a really, really long time to get to 60 and the temptation to make an alt May mean you never make it!
---
Meeting stones? 
---
LOL
---
The worried look on your cousins face is hilarious. I mean I would be too when there are 5 rogues every square foot 
---
How is rolling on an item ninjaing dieing leveling?
---
I agree completely. After Wrath the only time I enjoyed playing my Warlock was in MOP. 
---
Lol
---
Shared sub with retail for 15$/month. It is what it is.
---
This. 
---
Or just buy the water like the rest of us plebs
---
It doesn’t seem to have much to do with ping, I did it with 12ms today
---
Does the pope wear a funny hat? Yeah the ability to 100-0 burst anyone in the game is pretty valuable
---
Call me weird, but during retail Vanilla, I kept the loading screen tips turned on (unlike now, you could toggle them on/off back then) until I reached level 60 for the first time, because I didn't consider myself a noob anymore and therefore didn't need the tips.
---
I really don’t get the obsession people have with names. 
---
Best videos ever. 
---
Guild housing would have been perfect!
---
Undead? :)
---
&gt;100 hours
---
Rookie numbers*
---
Looks like you've never played a tauren simply named "Cow"
---
no its not required, its required to spend ur talent points on stuff that actually does something. its 15% more of the base version of the spell, before talents or gear. thats 120 more healing total or something like 20 per tick, considering you use max rank. (which you shouldnt, since its horrible hpm. 3 points are a total waste for such a minor gain, especially if you could spend them on stuff that actually improves your healing.
---
Funnily enough a friend told me they got sent to Ancient Dalaran. 
---
Vannila players called you guys Wrath babies. When Wrath started there was a ton of new players all of a sudden and they all rolled Death Knights. What class did you roll if you don't mind me asking? 
---
I’m probably just gonna wait 5-7 days and then start will be a much smoother ride I’d imagine by that stage. 
---
And as a full time worker I’m never gonna be on the sharp end of the curve anyway. No rush. 
---
NE Hunter.  I made it to level 14 before starting over, and that began years of making alts before ever getting close to 60.  I didn't hit 60 until just before BC, and carried that Tauren Shaman all the way through WotLK..  
---
And poisons.  And warlock summons.
---
Troll Shaman
---
Yea very funny ;) you are probably one of those new kids #nochanges that never played classic retail in the first place but still goes on crusade for every little bullshit that they have never experienced. 
---
You probably quit 2 days in relase kid
---
That sounds like a nice mix. 
---
😂 you need to spend them to progress further down the holy tree after 3/3 inspiration. There are literally no other options at that point which improve healing.
---
that's hilarious omg, even the game is confused about there being three dalarans!
---
Your name is Cancer?..
---
banning people who intentionally spawn the cleaner? what kind of world would it come to with people having fun in a video game being banned by blizzard? The classic difference is that you don't need big brother blizzard to intervene, whenever your reputation has a tangible consequence. 
---
He's asking about level 40 mount, it will be available day 1.
---
Err you need to spend the points to continue down the holy tree... what’s left that could improve healing in its place? 😂
---
I've been kicking around the idea of trying to make a bank alt named "Bank".  Wonder if its a forbidden name?  
---
I took time off for the whole Classic demo and it was worth every minute of it.
---
Gnome Mage, because I liked the snowy environment.
---
 Then around level 12 I re rolled on a PvP server as Orc Shaman and loved it.
---
No we don't need to keep creepy-ass traditions like that.
---
Amazing!
---
Nailed it.
---
And you’re actually referring to the ‘fresh 60’ spec, in which case the person wouldn’t have the +heals and it would be handy for dungeons, the main time you’d use renew. It’s better having it in renew than crit seeing as they will basically never crit with that level of gear.
---
Imagine taking yourself so seriously that you get mad about satire.
---
 Sweet guide, I love this kind of theorycrafting stuff. Some things I noticed:
---
The  damage per rage comparison chart seems off. Execute should be constant  dmg/rage yet it somehow does worse in the chart as attack power goes up.

---
true enough, but a man can dream of a world where we go from 1.1 patch by patch to 1.12
---
No. This didn't work in vanilla and will not work in Classic. 
---
Like I said, I don't like most quests lore wise because they are generic and I've seen them in other games. Kill x mobs because they are too close to our village. We're at war with these mobs. Kill them and bring me their y to as proof. It is boring.
---
Even if you never played Classic you can find out how to complete any quest on the internet.
---
Recently found out he was one of the best asheron’s call players as well before he started playing wow. Has he said anything about classic? Haven’t watched his streams in a few years
---
Yeah, it actually is. I don’t want sharding either, but there’s no real equivalency between time spent playing a game and time spent staring at a login screen. It’s like saying painting and watching paint dry are the same thing. 
---
No I played on a PVE server that was mostly Alliance so I was a Human Lock. I played an undead Lock in the classic demo and then decided to finally roll an Undead Lock in retail just to see what the Horde was like and I actually prefer the Horde community. I just hope people don't all switch factions to experience the other side in classic. For the Horde!

The only scenario I can think of is when a predominantly heal hybrid rolls on a caster pre-BiS to level the last few levels to 60, which is still scummy in a way. Otherwise I don't think anyone really cares about gear anyway.
---
It's the principle of the matter.  I have no intention to go back to retail (BFA) WoW.  If/when I do, I'll pay $15/m for just that.
---
No reason to charge an exorbitant fee like that for those just wanting to play Classic.
---
The G650VX I believe. Was a great laptop. Mine bit the dust during a mid summer sesh of impromptu Diablo 3. Maybe that’s why I hate that game...
---
Thank you for being the first sane, non-ham-fisted post on this issue I have seen either here or on Blizzard's own forums.
---
I agree with Ion that sharding will help in the short-term, in the starting zones (1-5, 1-10 maybe) and that it should only be during a **very limited period of time**. There are far too few people unwilling to have any kind of meaningful discussion about changes that aren't made for convenience or streamlining, but simply made so that people do not rage quit or have a tantrum **exactly like they did when the original game launched almost 15 years ago**. When the game originally launched and people had paid for the base game and were paying monthly for a subscription, they were **livid**  they would have an 8 hour queue or get kicked out because the servers were crashing and then have to wait in the aforementioned 8 hour queue all over again. As many have mentioned people were given free game time as recompense because Blizzard knew the experience was so dreadful.
---
Sharding should be killed off after a few weeks (which most definitions indicate is no more than 3). This is my opinion, not a fact, not a demand, not a childish tirade about how I am paying $14.99 a month and therefore have a right to decree that Blizzard should do what I tell them. 
---
I fully expect Blizzard will listen to what the vocal but **intelligible and rational** community says. The last few months have proven they are listening - not to what the belligerent #nochange screaming buffoons are screaming - to what the community as a whole thinks is reasonable and desirable in this historic and meaningful game.
---
The easy solution is to find a new guild now that plans to roll through Classic. 
---
All of my focus is on F5ing the Blizz tracker. /cry
---
Someone will probably even know when it was patched out, but yeah it won't be a thing.  Neither will priests buying quivers for ranged attack speed, or warriors spamming /sit to get rage, etc.  
---
Same zone in Classic, correct
---
Viable in pve or pvp?
---
PVE they're good, it's just that paladin, priests, and shamans are all better.
---
PVP they're fine again just every class is better. Except for flag carrying.
---
They're good, they're wanted in raiding and premades. It's just every other healer is stronger (heal wise)
---
I'm actually thiyof rolling druid so not trying to bash them
---
I'm hoping for a high pop PVE Horde server. 
---
holy nova and maxing holy specialisation would be a good idea for starters. sure you have 1 point free that you could in theory dump in improved renew since all the other options would be almost as useless, but 3 points is just a big waste.
---
also your pvp spec is a horrible approach to the famous tri spec. it should look more like this. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbhtMZVMGdcd
---
one could argue about dropping 1 point from improved manaburn for maxing inspiration, but both have benefits
---
There is no cow level. Welcome to Mulgore
---
Why not? They're putting a lot of work into revamping the game to be ready for classic, and they'll also have normal operating costs. I think that more than merits $15/month.
---
Orc warrior. I really wanted Tauren. It my buddy was playing troll. Decided to go orc so we could start together. If only I had known how easy it would have been to meet up. 
---
I also recall spending a lot of time in spirit or int plate just because it looked good. I was such a newb. 
---
We’re going to roll again together like we did in 2005. Orc warrior/troll shaman, and see how much we’ve improved .... or not. 
---
In dungeons the primary issue is they don't have a normal Resurrection. If someone dies, they have to run back. 
---
In raids honestly the most serious issue is most guilds run to many healers and HoTs don't stack. This leads to two problems: One, it appears Resto Druids have bad numbers because with to many healers everyone can "snipe" low health target to build their hp/s on meters. Druids can't do this &gt; Druids must be bad healers (this is bullshit, run less healers). Two, because HoTs don't stack, there are fairly severe diminishing returns on Resto Druids in raids. 
---
The third reason you often don't run very many Druids is Paladins and Shaman both want about 4 minimum, to optimize their impact from buffs (Blessings and Totems). Considering you can run as few as 8 healers total if they are actually good and use consumables, that is half your healers already. You still need Priests. Priests don't suffer from being stacked, so which one would you recruit more of?
---
So taken together this means that a raid will run 1-2 Resto Druids. One specced for HoTs and one specced for Moonglow to have a really powerful Healing Touch. That makes the spots for Resto Druids in raids fairly competitive but how much that matters is going to revolve strongly around how popular the class is, which isn't something we can predict outside of the few surveys that have been taken. However those 1-2 Resto Druids will actually have a good impact overall on the raid and are clutch for many fights. 
---
Hmm. Fair point about the talents. Perhaps some minor tweaking of talent trees to make other specs viable with the same number of talents?
---
In addition, add new content that provides gear for off specs to power them up. Instead of a new tier, expand tiers laterally for off spec.
---
I'm considering trying to get legolas on my mage just to piss off hunters
---
I didn’t know the wand / quiver thing! That’s interesting.
---
&gt; The bad news is at 60 switching from heals to shadow will soon cost u 50 gold a pop
---
There are raid spots for shadow priests, but normally only one if at all.
---
First class I rolled was a paladin. I didn't roll a death knight until near the end of Cataclysm to be honest. After my paladin I ended up rolling rogue and loved it. Combat spec. I am well aware of the term wrath babies man 
---
Not sure if sarcasm or legitimately stoopid
---
Only the last few ranks are extremely punishing. Sitting in top bracket each week is also dependent on how hard other people on your server are nolifing. After the tryhards have already ranked it gets easier but you still have to play a LOT to deal with decay.
---
Yes it should be banned. It’s a form of grieving that cannot be stopped, doesn’t matter if you have your entire guild guarding you. The person can literally just wait in ghost form near the demon, and resurrect once you start the fight, and instantly spawn the cleaner. Then you have to wait another 15 mins for it to come back. 
---
This may surprise you but some people are just dicks. And blizzard in the past did ban people for going too far. 
---
How about this?  
---
$60 for the main game.
---
Each major (raid implementation) patch $15/each.  BWL, AQ, NAXX
---
$105 total for everything.  This is overly fair for Blizzard for a 15yo game.  
---
Their greed won't allow it... because in the long run, subs will make more money, you know this, I know this.  One day, they will realize they should have put their fans before making money.
---
I'd be willing to do that and not have subscription time investment looming over my head.  Login whenever I feel like.
---
English at its finest. 
---
Mine was named “Dealer” lol
---
That's exactly my point though...most don't want to play BFA, so why do we have to pay $15/m just for Classic.  It's not like they will be actively working on it like BFA (if that's what they're calling it).

I hope you eventually relocated to a taller desk 
---
**Proper name (philosophy)**
---
In the philosophy of language a proper name, for example the names of persons or places, is a name which is ordinarily taken to uniquely identify its referent in the world. As such it presents particular challenges for theories of meaning and it has become a central problem in analytical philosophy.  The common sense view was originally formulated by John Stuart Mill in A System of Logic where he defines it as "a word that answers the purpose of showing what thing it is that we are talking about but not of telling anything about it". This view was criticized when philosophers applied principles of formal logic to linguistic propositions.

Dwarf master race
---
Really wanted to make a Tauren Hunter, but my friend had me go troll since the racial would be better for my DPS. This time around I think I’ll go Tauren. Still my favorite race. 
---
Either they get some money or they get NO money, their choice.  I will not out of principle pay $15/m for Classic.  If they had a $1-5/m option for just Classic, I would be more likely to play.
---
I don't want BFA access...that was the whole point of this thread lol
---
First off, anyone who says restro druid isn't good is full of shit. When it comes to raids, you want them along with the priests. The druid has mutiple instant heals so you can top off peeps before they get into trouble. You use your channeled spells to give a larger dose of heal.
---
Omen of Clarity: you have chance with your melee attack of next healing spell to cost zero
---
Nature's Swiftness: next nature spell becomes instant
---
Swiftmend: consumes rejuvenation or regrowth and heals them for full duration.
---
Improve regwroth: chance for crit heal
---
The utility is to important for raids. However when running in dungeons, it could be sluggish. But it's possible if you don't have idiots in the party. For dungeons preists are basically idiot proofing the dungeon. For raids Restro are generally secondary healers who are on the dps. The priests usually (should) be assigned to the tanks.
---
 
---
The issue with restro is the leveling; and it's just slower. Honestly some paths are better than others, but don't let it stop you.
---
Same with Scarlett Monetary. It's hard to get to as Ally
---
Well, yes...if you submit.  Enough people take a stance against it and they will be forced to come up with other models of monetization.
---
Good bot
---
This is my wand. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
---
My wand is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
---
Without me, my wand is useless. Without my wand, I am useless. I must fire my wand true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will ...
---
My wand and I know that what counts in war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit ...
---

---
Worked at some point in vanilla.
---
its actually the opposite, adding 5% crit when you only have 5% base doible ur inspiration uptime. if you have 10% crit in items you would jump from 15 to 20%, improving inspiration uptime much less.
---
Why are we locked down like that?  Why not have an option to purchase the game and it's major patches as an alternative.  If that ever did happen I would not be okay with a sub.  It would have to be strictly B2P like GW2.
---
Wrath was good times for sure! ICC 25 was the best!
---
I think I was like 8 years old and my first character was going to be a male NE because I thought they were cool in WC3. Then my brother convinced me to play horde on his Troll mage's server and I made an UD warrior. Now I cant even imagine making a male NE because I think they look so dumb (not even in a fun way) and love the Horde. I later abandoned that Warrior at around 33 because I was completely in the hole with outdated abilities, breaking armor, no money and I had no idea what to do about it at the time. I guess that's the closest you can get to losing at WoW. I then made an UD rogue that I got to level 54 by TBC. Very slow leveler back then.
---
Oh yeah and Reagents and Ammo. Soooo many of both!
---
Dual wield arms
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LqGxdhboxzVVzux
---
It’s ass but fun, a min/maxers nightmare
---
If they keep they cash shop away from it then $15/mo is an entirely fair price. MMO's have very high operational costs compared to other games.
---
Both specs have specialisation maxed, as well crit except one is 4/5 and you just agreed one point doesn’t matter. Ty
---
How can the shadow priest kill the warrior? Doesn't the warrior have slows, stuns, mortal strike, and immunity to fear?
---
Karazhan was indeed a baller instance/raid. I loved the tone of the entire place. Also helps that TBC was my favorite expansion. 
---
Can't stand not having a desk and real chair. How do you play for that many hours without carpal tunnel in that position. 
---
As a former raiding resto druid I wouldnt say they were bad but the big things that irked me were my cast times were really long (3 seconds) which often led to people sniping my heals. And the fact your hots were actually pretty damn Mana inefficient and often led to alot of over healing on top of that so in my experience they weren't the best thing to use in most circumstances. You can get revenge on all the pallys and priests stealing your heals with nature's swiftness + max rank healing touch though lol.
---
Are those videos from naxx patch?
---
I know this isn't what your looking for but RULE #1 Don't be a mouse clicker (clicking spells with your mouse; use keybinds). RULE #2 Use your mouse to rotate left and right (not  A or D; default keybind) and learn to strafe. Those two will put you leaps above the average first time/new MMO player.
---
It's a business. They make more money from doing the merged sub option than having a separate sub. 
---
It's worth picking up, unless you are really starved for silver. Saves a good chunk of time instead of drinking, especially during those few levels before you get to upgrade your water
---
and no spec has holy nova, good luck with pushbacks on vael.
---
I'm in the minority on this one, but my hope would be that they don't go down the path they've already traveled. 
---
I'd really like to see this dev team gets a chance to make an original expansion for level 60-70 that keeps the most important aspects of vanilla wow.
---
&gt; How about this?
---
&gt; $60 for the main game.
---
And have 1-5% of the players that they will have with a shared sub option...
---
Guess you dont want the 1.12 experience 
---
They added in battle groups and cross realm BGs before TBC...
---
You don’t use holy nova on Vael, you use PoH... thank you for demonstrating your incompetence.
---
Can't people just listen to blizzxon panel and know that sharing is for starter areas at launch and will disappear asap. It's something they know they don't want to use but is a necessary evil.
---
Sharding won't be in vanilla, except for launch. End thread.
---
Hey OP to answer one of your questions directly: Wanding is auto and will continue until you cancel it, but it does trigger the GCD and you won't be able to do anything else until the "cast" of wanding is done.  This is why I try and shy away from it while healing dungeons in case someone suddenly gets into shit and I should have already been casting a heal.  
---
Important note very likely relevant to Classic: Enchanter-made wands will be better than any spell you can cast until probably almost level 20!  Lesser Magic Wand and Greater Magic Wand just simply do more dps, and cost nothing!  
---
Dwarf Paladin
---
They dropped the “Massively” when they shoehorned in sharding. 
---
Sure it helps alleviate competition over quest mobs and nodes but it still reduces immediate player count. 
---
You can host your own personal server for testing purposes. Just Google how to do it and you'll have a working test server with gm commands to give you whatever gear you want. Takes less than an hour to setup.
---
&gt; After that the only realistic thing I could see (and accept) from Blizz is branching off into a WoW 2.0 with new, more serious and logical expansions from Classic.
---
That's what I was thinking too! Now there's three of us! (Some guy in another thread agreed with me once).
---
Spriest should beat any class in 1v1 at 60 if skill and gear are equal. You can make a case SL Lock once T2 gear or better.
---
&gt; you can
---
One can do lots of things, sure. 
---
Night Elf Rogue. I think I got to 4-5 before I made it to Dolanaar and saw like 10 other Night Elf Rogues standing around. 14yo me couldn't stand the fact that the combo was so popular and re-rolled a Human Mage.
---
Fast forward to Westfall, I'm killing defias and see an UD Rogue farming his red bandit mask. Ohshititspvptimeboys. I get wrecked - hard. So I figure Rogues are pretty cool again and the only starting area I hadn't tried yet was Dun Morough so I re-rolled a Gnome Rogue that I finally stuck with to 60. 
---
:D
---
&gt; I seriously forgot how important the priests wand was. Ive carried a mace since cata, damn.
---
You can carry a mace AND a wand in vanilla!
---
I can confirm.  Never saw a BoE epic on any of my many alts.  
---
Watched it like 2 days ago
---
I need the game now...
---
I've already gathered the information from your guide from this sub Reddit, but from what I gathered there are 2 different oppositions
---
1. Private server values are not the same as retail. Although human or orc weapon skill will raise dmg from glancing blows. It won't be as much as private servers
---
2. Boss mitigation values are incorrect on p servers and can open another can of worms that would mess with simulations.
---
Not knowing what the values are etc. At least from what I've gathered from theory Crafters here the only thing we can really do is just wait for beta or release to verify correct values.
---
That said, I know humans will have higher threat/ dmg when using a sword, but really by how much? And dwarf master race :p
---
Love this so much, on so many levels
---
So do you recommend going undead over orc for pvp then? Since I will mostly be struggling against other warlocks and not other classes for instance rogues? 
---
I’ve been similarly disappointed by how the forsaken went.  I get a lot of them being super pissed at their current state of unlife and taking it out on whoever they can, but I feel like there just aren’t any good hearted ones who dedicate the rest of their unnatural life to restoring Lordaeron as eternal protectors, cursed but forever working towards making sure such a thing never happens again.  
---
But nope, they’re all crazy, backstabbing, plague bombing lunatics.  
---
Yes 
---
Got any ~numbers on r14? Most likely wont ever try going for it but im curious
---
All of it.
---
This is the correct answer. Lack of community is why I stopped playing retail. I had more fun playing the classic demo because it actually had a community. By the end of the demo it was like one big guild.
---
Raises hand slowly 
---
 Genuinely curious if people would be happy with this, or angry due to #nochanges or devaluing existing boxes. 
---
If it wasn't too expensive I'd buy it, I'd love to have this on a shelf at home
---
While this is funny, I think they actually nailed it. You can play a short while and finish a couple quests or solo explore a small non-instanced dungeon. Other MMOs at the time required you to have a group in order to make it into any dungeons, and there weren’t many quests.
---
What podcast?
---
A good friend of mine passed away from long cancer a couple of years ago. I still have a character named after his main.
---
I don't think it should bother people much should they decide to do something along these lines.  Those who bought the collector's edition back then now will still have the "true" collector's edition, maybe now worth even more!  
---
However if they decide to do something like this, I believe they should provide the pets to the players who have the original collector's edition tied to their accounts already for use in Classic.  
---
I'm going to roll restoration too. My buddy and I are going to pvp a lot to so it should be fun.
---
But 1.5 AV was an actual fight.  1.12 AV is just a race to see who can complete the objectives first.
---
To clarify your opening statement, Blizzard is using Legion's final update 7.3.5 as the platform in which it is imprinting Classic on. Not BfA or anything after 7.3.5. Also there hasn't been a lot of discussion around this form Blizzard that I'm aware of. To build off your posts premise I'm curious if such addons like Trade Skill Master or other Auction API required addons will work. Considering we're building off the 7.3.5 platform its likely that it will.
---
I don't think any of those are mutually exclusive. If classic goes well enough and there's enough demand, there's no reason why all three couldn't happen (with staggered releases, of course). Fresh Classic servers are definitely going to happen. They could relaunch F R E S H vanilla for the next 20 years and have enough players for it to be worthwhile for them. I'd also be very surprised if TBC servers don't come to fruition too. The least likely option is Classic+ imo - higher outlay for a less certain level of RoI - but if Classic does well enough and the trend for modern retail WoW continues it could happen for sure.
---
That graph in particular is pretty complicated, and I still haven't really  figured out what the best way to convey what I want to really is.
---
About the graph: At first glance, there is something clearly wrong with Execute. How could its DPR become less efficient as AP grows? This is explained by the fact that Execute is not impacted by AP. In turn, abilities that scale with AP exhibit an increased efficiency in DPR with increased AP. Therefore, what the graph shows is that Execute damage efficiency decreases as your AP increases - not because AP causes its DPR to decrease, but because it is not affected by it and thus lags behind the two other skills that are.
---
Your suggestion on the axis is very spot on however, and I have now switched them around.
---
I'll make sure to change the wording on the HS vs Cleave section, since it seems to not be clear. I did not mean to say that Cleave didn't have a threat modifier to it, only that it was less pronounced than that of HS's.
---
I'll make sure to address all of your points though, you're very much correct in everything else and I really appreciate the feedback!
---

---
Meant to add, as an alternative to the sub option.  Much rather pay upfront than be locked into subs.
---
I hear this a lot in this sub and think its really exaggerated. My vanilla guild wasn't hardcore by any stretch if the imagination, and we cleared AQ40 no problem. Naxx maybe worse, I don't know. We ran out of time when BC was announced a lot of people dipped. On tedious part of AQ was farming NR gear, and I don't even think that was too bad.
---
One botty boi
---
No shit lol
---
If you don't mind them gouging you, fine.  I won't support that.
---
Yep, Shattered Hand. It was a great server for sure, the rivalry was a big part of that.
---
Pots have a cooldown that is not shared by bandages. They can coexist.
---
I don't doubt you, but I simply don't get it as a lv43 Spriest. Vampiric embrace + spam mind flay? What's the plan for me to not get rekt? And how the hell do I handle hunters kiting? 
---
I got so happy with warstomp on a warrior thatbwhen I made A dk twink it was amazing. It was right when they turned the air frost stun to a some sort of cast instead of instant. I would drop all my dd and dots then aoe and warstomp then nuke the fc. I would burn them down while everyone watched. So fun and OP at the time. You just have to know how to roll with the punches
---
I pointed out in the guide that this is very much based on the information we have at hand; you're right in that we don't know whether the values are the same as that of retail or not.  And that is precisely one of the reasons why in no part of the guide I attempt to simulate a full character's DPS!
---
None of that invalidates the guide, however. The same concepts will apply, and that is why I structured the guide this way.
---
When it comes to threat, that is also dependent on a multitude of factors which, again, are tied to simulating DPS in one way or another which I'll abstain from :).
---
(and I was a dwarf on my previous character, so I agree with you on that one!)
---
Out of combat, bandages are faster than eating, and cheaper than vendor bought food if you use your own cloth.
---
In combat, it's super nice to have if you have some sort of CC to pair it with. Having both will be nice in case someone ganks you out in the open, you'll have the health advantage for sure.
---
Godly
---
All good mate 👍 
---
From what I’ve seen literally anyone who ganks lowbies is bad at the game. People can make whatever excuse they want but people gank so they can feel success 
---
Exactly what is going to be revamped that is different from the base game all those years ago?  What warrants the same sub fee they charged in 2004, 15 years later?  I'm legitimately curious.
---
Back then they were actively working on each next bit of content, that is the point of the sub fee.  All that content is ALREADY CREATED at this point in time.
---
Hahaha omg. That red nerd chair. So quality. Such ergonomic. MUCH ugly. Wow. 
---
Orc warlock.  I had to be an orc because of the dance. 
---
This is fake, I can tell because of the pixels
---
So with sharding, am I guaranteed to be able to play with my friends? 
---
I’m planning on leveling with my friend as a pally / warrior duo and does sharding put groups on the same server? Or would it just be kinda like too bad 
---
This sums it up. I have to agree the snipping doesn't help. In my experience those who snipe are cocky thinking they can heal outside their assignment. I've seen one to many raids blame us druids for some hot shot not focusing on his assignment.
---
Depends on what's in the cash shop.  If it's BS like stat altering costumes as in Black Desert, then yes.  If it's like GW2, then no, I don't agree.  
---
They already put in a shop in retail WoW, all while players are paying a sub fee and top dollar for expansions.
---
He's not simply sitting to force a proc though, he's spamming sit to abuse server latency and make the server think he's not forcing those crits. You were not supposed to get procs off forced mob attacks.
---
What about being super ugly and short tho that seems kinda crappy especially cause they smell like orcs and are about as smart as a troll 
---
A pserver launched today. I took Jaina. On my lock :^)

 **\[H\] &lt;Cerberus&gt; - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)**
---
While  wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of  the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild.  With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held  to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two  raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for  repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared.  
---
Off  nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s,  and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing  we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding  schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile  to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders  of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership  experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)    
---
    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP! 
---
**Loot System:**
---
    We are leaning towards a zero-sum DKP system but it is not yet decided. 
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment. 
---
**Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)   
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)    
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

That looks awful and retarded. What a mistake putting this back in
---
Female night elf rogue. I picked her because I like playing rogues in D&amp;D and I wanted to be a pretty race. Yeah I was one of -those- people. I kept that same rogue until I quit in late Cataclysm though so I guess it worked out! Definitely going to be remaking her for Classic too!
---
how is the use of the word shekels anti-Semitic?
---
cardboard for armor, a flashlight for a weapon, such is the life of a guardsman
---
Besides all the technical changes, bug squashes, and the time and pay to do so?
---
They're providing a service, uptime on their servers, in order to play classic. I can't fathom that none of it deserves any compensation. If it's not making a profit, ultimately they aren't going to offer it. They have the same guiding motive as every other company out there.
---
Just as an anecdote. Theyve got to have at least 1 sys admin full time to support all these efforts right? A former classmate graduated and went to work as a junior Linux sysadmin for them and I know for a fact he was offered 65k salary for the position. Software isn't free (and neither is maintaining software - let alone rebuilding legacy systems from 14 years ago).
---
I don't mean to stand up here on the soapbox, but it feels a little insulting or ignorant to hear what I took as an implication that there's no 'real' work to make this happen.

Oh man, that would be better than all the expacs since MoP, imagine a warplost detachment of guardsmen and Astartes land on Azeroth. Burn the heretic, purge the mutant, kill the xenos. In the name of the Emperor, let none survive. It would be glorious
---
Are you the type of person who never turned on a single cheat code growing up? Just to fuck around? That's what ganking is to me. I enjoy a challenge but that doesn't mean I only enjoy challenges. Sometimes you just want to roflstomp someone and fondly remember the days of being on the receiving end of it.
---
No skin off my back if it's not your thang, but making a sweeping generalization isn't the best move
---
If it's truely 1.12, then in theory the add ons should work.
---
I personally won't play at launch if there's Sharding, and that's essentially because I want the experience that comes from hundreds of people all sharing the same, crowded zones.  I don't want the streamlined, smooth questing experience at launch, I can get that at literally any other time.
---
I want the chaos, watching the collective playerbase attempt to adjust and make the world work for them in exceptional conditions, standing amid a sea of toons, not Blizzard intervening from on high to ensure that Launch Day plays just like any other day on WoW.
---
The low-middling population, smooth, streamlined questing experience is the norm, in WoW. Anybody who wants that can get it simply by waiting a few days.  It's in their power to obtain. Anybody who wants to SEE the giant community they ate a part of, regardless of leveling efficiency?  We get maybe two chances in the entire lifespan of the game: Launch and AQ Gates.
---
I cannot supprt culling one of the most unique game experiences out there to make room for more of the same.
---
Ah the maintenance...and I'd try to get interested in 9kaying a different realm but it never worked. I wanted my normal world back lol
---
40-man raids. All that matters is that you show up and are reliable.
---
Dwarf hunter was the first. The cinematic convinced me, I mean a fucking bear who listens to you. I quickly abandoned that for a Human Rogue who was my main through Cata. When I came back for WOD I re-rolled shaman and didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped. I played a DH for legion since I lost all connection to my characters. Havent played BFA and wont. Looking to restart the journey and rebuild my story. 
---
Can confirm, this is how undead rogues speak.
---
Don't think edgelord was even a term back then. We called them emos.
---
I didn't but now I do. I can't thank OP enough for bringing this to light. 
---
Not so temporary?  I think we need to see the mullet in it's full glory now brother. 
---
The goodnews is that for Warlocks youg et a free mount at lvl 40 so you have no need for the 100g.
---
This means you can spent a couple G at gear and the bis for lvling comes around that level aswell in the form of shadoweave. You can either buy it from the AH or craft it yourself using TL.
---
As for as Proffesions during leveling I would suggest First Aid without a doubt regardless of your endgame goals.
---
If time is off the essence for your levelibg I would skip alk other proffs until 60. If not I would recommend Skinning and vendoring the skins it will give you an allright amount of loss effort gold especially at later levels. Prob not recommended to skin every mob at low lvl just enough to get your skill up.
---
At level 60 Tailoring and if min maxing Engineering are the go to Warlock proffesions.
---
TL due to providing pre bis in the form of RoV and RoTWN aswell as felcloth pieces and most importantly come p4 you will get BV and need TL to get the 2% crit bonus.
---
Eng gives you Sapper charges and battlepets that give raidwide benefits and other niche items that help in speedrunning or in PvP whatever your goal mighg be but is a bit of a gold sink especially if your other proff is not mining as it is in our case.
---
Also with going the cultist way I would recommend you join our ranks over at the [Classic Warlock discord](https://discord.gg/3fvUDqF) Its a great source of information.
---
Eh, limitation of their cloud architecture.
---
Will probably happen in Classic too, unless they decide to host on dedicated hardware. 
---
You didn't really see a lot of rogues on the horde that weren't undead. 
---
Hahahaha love it
---
Looks like it works though is the problem.  Now we're only talking about 5 sec vs 25 seconds to stack your procs.  Doesn't really invalidate the issue.
---
Gnolls, murocs, cobalts, and quilboars having a god tier aggro radius. That and running away which aggro more. Ah good times lol
---
Pst pst, ally players, remember Hogger xD

---
I couldn't remember, but I'm not surprised. The embroidery was the only thing I ever liked about tailoring. I do remember talents finally became cool when things like Life Bloom and Embroidery made the specific profession combo awesome for Warlock.

Rogue Doge for sure.

Got up to Rank 13 in Vanilla. Can definitely slow grind it to 10-11 but after that point it's really all hands on deck. On a high pop realm I was doing about 14 hours a day to Rank 12 for what I believe was about 3 weeks, then about 18 hours a day for another 3 weeks after that. Mind you this method usually gave me a day or two off each week depending on the competition. The grid was real but damn was it fun. If only I had that fraps footage still....

And pwning n00bs with his naxx epics and gifting large amounts of gold to females for the chance to mate.
---
New game, new CE's.  Anyone that thinks this invalidates old CE for retail fail to realize we're talking about different games.
---
I'd love to see a CE for Classic as they've given for all of their other games.  Also a cloth map of Azeroth.
---
Good luck with that epic mount.  I didn't get one until TBC...  Everything is expensive and obtaining gold is a game within itself. 
---
Where the SW dock is now was originally a dev playground for housing Development. Until flying was added, that area was just full of "neighborhoods" that were deemed unfeasible.
---
Yeah, I'm cheap and short on time..that's why I'm probably going to play a paladin 
---
Yeah, I think I recall it happening in each of those eras of WoW, just way less severe, like not stuck for what felt like forever, and way less often.
---
You’re asking why people want to raid in classic vanilla? 
---
Why do all these photos from the mid 2000s look so vintage lol
---
They designed westfall first and EK before kalimdor... guess it makes sense. 
---
It's a fantastic ability, definitely pick it up.
---

---
Don’t need consumables? Lmao. 
---
Strat living side 
---
Farm righteous orbs, groups will do round robin with them. If you can get a good group of 3-4 people with decent gear you can make nice gold 
---
I would love it. But I'm torn between higher res models of the same rewards (Diablo etc) or new ones all together .
---
I've quit my job in order to guarantee I have the time off since we don't have a release date yet.
---
I deffo got called Edgy back in my Emo days of 2006. idk if it dates any further back than that tho
---
They got another invis in bc. In beta they had a rogue stealth and could cast from stealth. Decided it was broke as hell.
---
Thank you that’s what was implicated I was worried no one was going to pick that up 
---
Truth, however I got lucky and saw my first rares and epic drop till that troll dungeon in Taranis. Didn't see another epic drop till my first raid months after 60 lol
---
Get it ASAP. Especially if your on PVP. 
---
I found people would always try and gank me of I was low mana. Knowing mana shield would run me OOM almost immediately and there's no better feeling than forcing them to watch you Evo while sheeped, then proceeding to crit their frozen faces to death haha
---
That ended really abruptly

Bye then.

Will be a Troll Warrior with the intention of tanking on a US PvP server. I started playing in the later months of 2005 up until WOTLK where I slowly lost interest in the game. I have been playing version 1.12 since on servers such as: The Rebirth, Feenix, Wowscape, Emerald Dream, and more. It goes without saying that I am no stranger to Vanilla mechanics and have already re-lived the glory days of tab-tanking. I'm looking to find a guild or start one with intentions on raiding between the times of 1700-2300 hours Pacific Time. I am looking to do everything I missed out on in the glory days, including AQ40, &amp; Naxxramas.
---
Not exactly a celebrity then
---
People will be watching while playing 
---
That's the point though, I don't know about any hidden gems that might be great for PVP!
---

---
Theres literally no Wow in this pic. That monitor doesn't have wow on it.
---
I would gladly pay 15$ a month or more to be paired with more serious players. I paid 20$ for 2 Tortilla Wraps at a café yesterday, 3$ for parking.
---
15$ is nothing and you get so much out of it!
---
Pretty sure everyone's first was a night elf Hunter
---
I played a course of trial accounts with the old 14 day trail vouchers. Dwarf hunter I got to 10 got a pet and leveled leather working and made rough as looking leather gear from the skins of mobs I had killed god the game seemed so enormous.
---
Mates and I ended up getting the full game and leveling some humans but when a third finally caved and got it there were huge as server queues so we rerolled. I went a gnome Mage and got him to 60 cleared BWL and AQ40 up to twin emps. Found such a good guild and loved the game so much.
---
Thank god for that server queue.
---
To be fair, even I wouldn't have defended Protection Paladin at all back then, lol.  However, nowadays I can actually see them doing something in dungeons at least, assuming unlimited water, so I'll give them a chance at that this time.  And theoretically, they should be just fine at even tanking in raids for anything that doesn't outright require taunting because they can obviously wear all the same gear as Warriors besides tier gear, and Righteous Fury makes their threat generation...probably okay?  Maybe?  For normal raiding, not for speedclearing stuff but not going super slow either.
---
Actually, back then, I never even came across Paladins that wanted to tank anyway; it was all Paladins that wanted to heal, deal damage, or had Blessing of Sanctuary as a healer.  So it's not like I even had an opportunity to give them a chance.
---
I was amazed to learn that Myndflame is a youtuber now.
---
It's true!
---
And not only does it take a long time to get to 60 in general, there's so many things to level.  Professions, weapons, finding the trainers.  Walking everywhere until 40.  Everything is a lot slower in general. 
---
If I could level a Warlock again first I would go undead warlock instead of human and take engineering/mining. That is interesting about first aid. I think I only leveled first aid for an achievement lol!
---
Okay, but there must be some sort of endgoal for most classes? I'm not talking about niche cases like a flag carrier set, but the everyday gear you would use in PVP.
---
Like, imagine you want to play a Holy Paladin in Vanilla, with focus on PVP. What is your endgoal when it comes to gear? Whether you can actually get your hand on it is another story of course, but you got to have some kind of progression path in your head... no? 
---
Old Vanilla addons won't work if they're using LK and Cata cores surely.
---
But the Beta will have mod makers working overtime .
---
Anduin was like 6yo in Classic so that one would suck pretty bad :p
---
Personally think the antagonists would be cooler. 
---
What do you mean. Its not like rolling would give you the item if you win.  Ninja looting is just picking the item up regardless. 
---
I think blizzard are afraid of an event where 4 million people, in the same moment, spawn in at once. Even across realms, without sharding, the servers will implode.
---
Each realm could be significantly more full than there were even at the original release of the game.
---
I think it's possible that sharding will allow us to experience the starting zones how they were in the original game.
---
No
---
What is this, VR post?  The laptop screen has 3d effect
---
No, because they wouldn’t work with the modern client. 
---
I love TBC and would *love* to play it fresh again.  
---
That being said my problem with the way blizzard releases expansions is how everything previous is effectively null and void and a complete waste of time.  
---
Releasing TBC or any other expansion makes vanilla dead again.  And the cycle just replays itself.   If they could change that somehow, I'd be really *really* happy about TBC/WotLK re-released. 
---
What source shows it's a different client?
---
He specifically said something that will help you level.
---
I dunno man. Like I do that shit, I dont give a fuck. I roll of stuff that will help me level and I dont  consider it a ninja
---
I used to have that same Saitek keyboard around that time. I thought it was the most badass shit ever because it was back lit. 
---
This needs more upvotes :p
---
Magatha Grimtotem has always been pretty intriguing to me so it'd be cool to see a Warbringers of her. Given the kind of power she has it's a wonder she isn't a bigger character in retail, but getting a Warbringer for her would be cool to explain her backstory and motivations.
---
Goliath online 
---
Eh, tough talk but we all know you’ll be punching in your card info in a few months. You even had to reference an in-game ability to describe your “disgust.”
---
HoTs have crap efficiency and throughput anyway so it's really not an issue they don't stack. They aren't worth casting in the first place.
---
Wands?
---
Right, exactly!  I played a handful of MMOs before WoW.  Starting from Ragnarok Online, I went to Lineage 2, Priston Tale, Gunbound, Mabinogi (for a very tiny bit), FLYFF (also for a very tiny bit), and maybe one or two other Korean ones I can't remember.  So I was able to see how WoW almost single-handedly changed the genre, including in the communities formed around MMORPGs.
---
And like you said about newer players, it's not all bad or all good.  For example, a great deal of Classic WoW back then, to me, was terrible both as a game and in some parts of the community, but I still loved it overall.  
---
Slight rant:
---
Not saying you implied this, but, In my opinion, Blizzard didn't ruin its own game; that'd be silly.  It was just always trying to serve the audience it had cultivated, which is even what they were doing in Classic.  They **could have** fixed hybrid classes and other things like improved non-raiding endgame stuff, but they focused extremely on raids instead because that was the audience they had made as well as where the devs were coming from, being hardcore MMORPG players themselves in the past.  By removing levelling as the primary objective, contrary to other MMORPGs at the time, that naturally made the audience focused on what happens at max level, and that was raiding.
---
Huh? Are you sure this was possible to attain in retail? My father was very involved in at least the level 19 twink scene, and I don't recall him ever mentioning this. He'd painstakingly catalogue every single powerful lvl 19 twink he came across. An ilvl 50 item attainable at lvl 19 is nuts.
---
Or perhaps the BiS lvl 19 chest is somehow even more powerful than this?
---
I’m dead lmfao

Except that Reckoning was patched in 1.8 to not proc off forced crits, which means the only way you could force those crits was by abusing the server latency. It was a workaround around the fix Blizzard implemented.

It really significantly cuts downtime, especially for us warlocks. Health is mana with a step inbetween \^\^. FA is ez enough to keep up whilst waiting for transportation like zepplins or boats.

when leveling (presumably as shadow) that last minute dungeon wand killing blow for spirit tap is soooo clutch

No, I'm just saying I find it crazy that people would want to rush to raiding.

No one said anything about meeting stones. Just talking about the group browser. No queue no crossrealm. Just a browser where you can put what you wanna do (dungeons, quest etc) and people can sign up.

---
Totally pointless topic, blizzard will not budge on the price. Also, if 15 bucks a months too much for you, don't play
---
Aren't nearly as effective as they are for Locks/Priests because Mages have no DoTs, thus can't abuse the 5SR.
---
If you look strictly at racial passives, then it's no contest. Undead warlock. However if you care about stats, gnomes have a better pull.
---
(blizzard has a bias for alliance races btw with base stats)
---
Nothing ninja about rolling. The ninja i remember was the mofo who lost the roll on the Magisters pants and looted anyway. I happily scratched his name into the blacklist.
---
Exactly, as someone who was there on launch day in vanilla (even if I was barely a teen) and there for more than a couple of vanilla private server launches, the 13,000 people trying to log in/quest at the same time thing was HIGHLY overrated. 
---
So how is he looting though? U just ffa loot on bosses? That's your own fault
---
I stand alone by god smack 100% takes me back to 19 twink bgs. 
---
I always thought that playing Human Warlock was suboptimal until we got Every Man for Himself. Then it was finally worth it. The increased rep gains was also helpful during the dark iron rep grind if I remember correctly. It's been so long that I might be way off though. I think I played a weird combo of Human Warlock with herbalism and tailoring. After Vanilla when racials and professions provided abilities it turned out to be awesome for Warlock. I wouldn't recommend for Classic though.   
---
That would be a great hype song before a slaughter

Put it this way. I leveled from 35 to 40 killing mobs in the badlands. No quests. It was faster. It took me a week to hit 50 on that character using guides for best xp for time spent.
---
So it does heat up a little at the exhausts when Playing MWO on high settings with 35 fps (some dips to 15 like a hiccup?). I have it on the table tho so didn't bother me. If it was on my lap and the exhaust pointin at my knees I'd be uncomfortable. Would definitely need a laptop boarrd or pad.

Took some time to get things configured correctly, it has 2 gpu and didn't seem to switch over correctly to the high performance kne. Uninstalled reinstalled drivers, updated everytjing, all seems good now.

Going to upgrade to an m.2 SSD soon and another 8gb ram.

Unfortunately my kids have played more than me today. I only got one game in hahaha.

Agreed. The first month after launch is as long as sharding should be "needed," and should be disabled after that point.

Blink-182, New Found Glory, Angels &amp; Airwaves, Sum 41

Why is everyone so dense.  Can you get procs from sitting or not?  Yes, clearly you can.  Clearly the patch wasn't perfect.  Clearly having latency is abuse in your book.  Lets assume every Paladin doesn't have sub 100ms.  The point is you can fucking sit down, and fucking get a stack.  I don't care that it's more tedious, it wasn't actually fixed.
---
Dude I swear this happened to me A LOT. Back in the late vanilla / early BC days when I Was leveling my first character, I would convince my mom I was sick and had to stay home only to discover it was Tuesday.
---
Impulse! You guys were on Daggerspine right? Always looked up to you guys. You guys were beasts
---
I hate the idea, but I understand why it might be needed at launch. I do pray that they remove it after the initial rush, though. I want a grounded experience... not one where I'm constantly in a matchmaking lobby. It has no place in an MMO except for ad a temporary measure.
---
Limp Biscuit haha. Or 2000’s house music. 
---
Great video.  I had a feeling that there would have been parts of the community asking for classic servers even before wrath, but no idea that blizzard responded to any of those posts.
---
You had me at bridge in STV, that was the exact one. Barely anything more than a teaser, but it was enough to spark all the curiosity I had.
---
I've been at a few of the 6-10k pserver launches. It's amusing briefly, but it quickly becomes an unplayable nightmare. Either every mob is tagged within 3 seconds of spawning and leveling is impossible, or dynamic respawns are turned up so high that you basically can't even loot the corpse of what you killed before it respawns and is attacking you again.
---
No. Wether or not this is true to the 1.12 client I can't say. It is however not true to the Legion client the game is being made on and will not be backported in.
---
If they do, it should be something like the Diablo 3 seasons or god forbid season/comestics like fornite...

---
"Cool"
---
Was too busy playing, don't recognize this shit.
---
Yeah it was real. You could roll on anything that dropped whether you could use it or not. There was one rule I found particularly dumb with group loot was that often people wanted everyone to pass on group loot, and then we'd manually roll for it afterward, because in the heat of battle apparently it was common for people to accidentally hit greed or pass because it'd pop up on screen when they were clicking stuff. I got a lot of shit back in the day for rolling need on my warrior for the axe from one of the bosses in RFK because I did it while we were still fighting or whatever.
---
* Blizzard makes it so you can't just sit down and get Reckoning stacks
---
* Players find a workaround by abusing server latency
---
It's not the players being laggy, it's making the server believe you're sitting to force the crit and then standing when you receive the crit. That's 100% because of the server. The player's MS has nothing to do with it.
---
&gt; it wasn't actually fixed
---
By that logic you should be able to wallwalk and do other exploits in Classic because hey, "it wasn't actually fixed".
---
I’m rolling an Orc Warlock and I’ll have Skinning / Mining. At 60 I’ll swap skinning for Engineering as I’ll keep all my mats while levelling by mailing them to an alt. When the ZG patch looms I’ll replace mining with Tailoring for my Bloodvine bonus. By ZG patch I’ll have an alt to mine. 
---
I’m a 33-year old hoping to find exactly that type of guild asap

Not to be too pedantic, but weapon swapping was changed in vanilla WoW. Originally a weapon swap incurred no penalty, including no GCD. The GCD penalty was added in post Dire Maul, but which exact patch I would have to look it up.
---
Warriors rage starve against the pw: shield. This combined with very high physical damage reduction from shadow form and inner fire means they will not hit you very hard or very often. You can usually simply dot and mind flay them down (especially with any blackout procs). If you’re undead or troll, you’ll kill even faster with devouring plague or shadowguard. Unless they just get a ridiculous string of crits, and equally geared spriest will win every time against a warrior. 
---
Well I got called a ninja for that axe which is why I included that example. Nothing ever came of it because I think it was clear I was a huge noob, but it was as he said, me rolling on something that will help me level.
---
I highly doubt you see any of that. Just roll on what you need. I am going to

Thanks for the info. I figured as summer drew closer there'd be some servers mentioned.

I really just want to avoid most internet groups in my server and hopefully battle cluster. My original server was full of Goon Squad mooks from SomethingAwful that liked to grief and make Trade Chat miserably unreadable.

There are some instances where you can ninja where it should've been rolled, like stuff found in chests. Also, people generally agree you shouldn't roll for off specs when it could go to someone's main spec, like a feral druid rolling on a caster gear against a mage.

---
Advice? Just remember that how you act will stay with your character, both good and bad. For an online game with anonymous people playing it, you're held accountable for a lot more than you'd think.   
---
Aside from that, I'd say to make friends when you can without forcing it, and to enjoy the social/exploration/leveling as major elements to the game...
---
Oh right: **join a good guild.** One with GM/officers who are accountable is a huge bonus. I remember having issues with people who'd be super rude or ninja loot, and finding out who their GM was. The ninja looter would put me on ignore, and I'd bring it up to their GM. They don't want those players in their guild either, so once they verified what happened, the ninja got booted.   
---
Good guilds have your back, and you should have theirs in return; trust is a huge component of the game.
---
The build does deviate somewhat, yes, but not enough to prevent you from healing. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on viewpoint), there are so few talents that actually help the build that you end up having a lot of spare talent points that you just have to sink into the tree to unlock the talents you ACTUALLY want. And that means you can spend those talent points on whatever you want, including healing.
---
The "Key Talents" that you want are Meditation (3/3), Spiritual Guidance (5/5) and Spirit Tap (5/5). With those, you can basically go infinite and never need to stop casting. That mandates a 13/25/5 split at least, with an additional 8 points for any tree. The real tragedy is there are actually 2 more excellent talents, but they're too deep into Discipline to reach without sacrificing Spiritual Guidance (Force of Will and Power Infusion).
---
Was that a 24-picture or 36-picture film?

Wands for all classes that can use them have a "shoot" function that works just like a hunters auto shot. Other bow using classes like rogue and warrior have a "shoot" ability that has no auto function, just a one off bow shot

---
O.o that's weird. If that's the case they could at least make the enhanced graphics on par to retail. A toggle like in Halo:CE anniversary.
---
&gt;With Classic not being changed much
---
That is the goal; there should be as few changes between *vanilla* and Classic as possible (barring the massive conversion work they need to do for it to fit the new architecture, fix bugs etc).
---
&gt;What about those of us that don't want to play BfA and hate the direction the game has shifted.
---
Then don't play it. A shared sub is unfortunate but any sub/game purchase would go into the ActiBlizz coffers anyway.
---
&gt;The whole reason we wanted Classic in the first place.
---
And now; not so much?
---
&gt;Why do we have to pay $15/m for just Classic?
---
Return on investment, server costs, GMs (hah!), Non-Classic-WoW development (unfortunate, yes), gate keeping (very important for me personally).
---
B2P will cheapen every aspect of the game and just begs for a cash shop to be added (gotta secure that revenue stream, yo).
---
It wasn’t on classic since I was too young to play then but when I started in Cata it was a troll warlock I guess originally I started in wotlk or tbc when my uncle showed me the game and made me a nelf rogue but I don’t count that 
---
I got down voted for saying this =(
---
have you paid any attention at all to anything at all related to classic
---
they have on multiple occassions said they don't have the source code for old wow anymore
---
Don't do that
---
thee rainbow bridge?
---
You can't cast spells and wand at the same time - it's the equivalent of white hitting a mob with your staff. The purpose of wanding is to save mana on mobs. Don't think of your mana as your only resource bar... If you can face tank something at full life to get a few wand hits in, it's worth. 
---
At 60 it can be pretty important if tank threat is bad, or for mana management purposes. On alliance paladins can Judge Wisdom on the boss, and every hit you do with your wand, will return a small bit of mana to you.
---
All the sharding all the time #bringbackretail #changes #vanillaandsprinkles 
---
@Cat: take the Holy Shield, it's so OP
---
BTW, I have nothing against paladins on vanilla, but these are TBC talents! And you're probably a bloodelf!
---
Yes, gameplay wise. Are you a senile or why it is so difficult to understand. I can't understand why it is so difficult to separate hardware and software for someone. Blizzard didn't manufacture any of my hardware back then or never was ISP. So those things doesn't have anything to do with Blizzlike product. 
---
Honestly Jaina Warbringer made me the most hyped and interested in an expansion since LK (crawling through YouTube to find arthas lore).
---
I listened to Jaina again today randomly haha that's what procced the thread.
---
Haha but it could summarise his parents stories and why he's just chilling in SW Keep I never knew that when I first played. Instant quest text FTL
---
Gnome Rogue. And Mained him until WoTLK. 
---
Now if a warrior rolled on a pre bis caster piece to level his weapon skill faster + spirit set for lvling without asking first, that would be scummy.
---
Gnome rogue.  Couldn’t decide, so I used the Gary Gygax method.  The dice spoke.
---
Can't have blood touching blood.
---
That would just be gay, or something. 
---
Human Warlock. I picked it because I liked the look of Alliance, wanted to be a spellcaster, didn't like the look of Gnomes, and liked the red robes more than the blue. I played that character through all of BC, had great fun, then jumped ship to play a Death Knight when WotLK came out.
---
I don't think they will do it and don't see why they would. . 
---
BUT IF THEY DO I AM GETTING 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Shadow priests are filthy at PVP. You’ll find it quite fun to see how much you dominate people. 
---
Leveling up to 60 your gear will matter more than your spec for healing, so keep it current. 
---

Yeah there are some people on reddit who just have no sense of humor. I got banned from

/KingkillerChronicles reddit page for posting a joke about the third book coming out or rather not coming out. (Been 8 years since book 2). Even though over 200 people liked it a mod got pissy and banned me. 
---
I have the song downloaded and listen to it frequently. It's just so damn good!
---
That’s what gives me cause to worry, they may well add new moneytisation methods. You can say they won’t, but they are more activision than blizzard.
---
O.o They are.
---
Just using Classic models and textures still from 1.12, but the rest of the graphics are the new client. More shadows. Further draw distance (if you choose) DX12 comparability. 
---
But I like being an edgy tryhard :(
---
The point of your comment is that Blizzard is being greedy. It's a common and offensive Jewish stereotype that Jews are greedy. 
---
Blizzard is an American company, they do buisness in American dollars. There would be absolutely no reason for you to say shekels, the currency of Israel, instead of dollars, if not to make the association that Blizzard is being greedy like a Jew. 
---
Using the word shekel in context where it belongs is not antisemitic. Using the word shekel in context of greed, and nothing else, is antisemitic.

I vote for Emperor Dagran Thaurissan. A very iconic dungeon boss, in one of the (if not most) iconic dungeons in endgame, and drops the amazing Ironfoe. 
---
Besides, the story of the Dark Iron Dwarves and Thaurissan's marriage to Moira are very interesting and would make for a good trailer.
---
Come'on baby I got blessing of protection! 😍

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
Oh
---
You are serious?
---
It's not that bad. Just think of it as your normal Blizz sub and never touch 8.0  And can we stop calling "retail" They are both going to be... retail. :-/
---
In the beginning it wasn't auto, but it was added during vanilla.
---
It was not auto for rogue / warrior to shoot bow, xbow etc
---
That sounds like a recipe of looking ugly. Outdated models in an enhanced world.. Would have been smarter to have a character model switch too. Oh well
---
There are three flavors of Warlock PvP.
---
The most commonly used one you'll see is SM/Ruin, because it is a spec that you can raid well with and does well in PvP. It isn't fully min-maxed towards raiding like DS/Ruin nor is it the best PvP spec, but the best middle ground for solo grinding, pvp and pve.
---
Then there is SL for PvP, the most survivable PvP spec for Warlocks. It is a very lean gearing spec because you only worry about Stamina and Spelldamage. To make the most use out of this spec you want to play very much aggressive, spreading curses and dots on everyone while making use of your superiour surivavility. Killing an SL warlock or even winning a duel against one is incredibly difficult even for the best duelers. It is a spec that grinds down enemies rather than burst them down.
---
Then there is the more burst oriented Destruction spec for PvP, very much the opposite of SL but also PvP focussed. It is weaker than SL in terms of dueling and surviving but stronger in terms of flashy, high impact plays.
---
Thx. I’m still learning how casters work, especially in classic. Tried a lock in pserver, was a blast at lower levels with wand. But yes - dots and pets contribute to it a lot. 
---
Yes I know that, but that's one hell of an excuse. Private servers have the original code. Didn't they get the nostorus guys on board? Those who ran the largest 1.12 private server?
---
Three Days Grace - Home, leveling an undead priest in Tirisfal, somewhere around level 11  
---
Skindred - Pressure, leveling a NE druid in redridge  
---
Breaking Benjamin - So cold, pretty much all of hillsbrad leveling as horde  
---
Iron Maiden - Wicker Man, pvping on my undead warrior, first character above 30, with my whirlwind axe  
---
None of the old addons will work. Some of the modern addons might work, some of the new addons might work after a few modifications or the addons might have to be rewritten completely.
---
Depends on your class as well. If you’re a Druid and can run flags you’ll get it no problem. If you play as an undergeared character with a terrible spec you’ll have a bad time. 
---
Yep, I never saw a BoE epic drop 1-60 in Vanilla.
---
That's one of my favorite parts though!
---
Thanks for the responses! I ended up buying it, and it's fucing great.
---
They are using the modern client and baking Classic into it to put it simply. Because of modern anti cheat and stuff like that.
---
And no, private servers don't have the original code, they have the original compiled client which is completely different.
---
I didn't think it was weird when I played the demo, it looked fine.
---
"Ok listen the fuck up."
---
It should be one. I've never quite said it phrased as such, but I'm pretty vocal about how kids these days are missing out on good audio solutions. Man there is zero reason to spend $200+ on a pair of un-amped Sennheisers, when that price puts you almost half way to a proper home theater. 
---
It gets expensive when you start adding things like fancy speaker stands, quality bookshelf speakers, ATMOS setups, etc -- but even the cheapo HTiaB solutions will rock you out of your room while gaming. It's one of those things people don't realize they're missing until they sit center-stage of a legit surround setup while gaming. The whole damn room is alive.
---
About the only people that should be buying headsets are kids living at home, or adults with persnickety spouses and sleeping children. I'll pull out the wireless headset late at night *sometimes* -- they have their place. But they shouldn't be your primary audio solution.
---
If you live alone especially, budget yourself an AVR setup. They're less than your fancy monitor and just as important.
---
Underrated comment
---
With the modern API also comes modern ways of doing things that required extensive scripts. Macro conditionals for example is something like that.
---
    /cast [stance:1,combat]Berserker Stance;[stance:1,nocombat]Charge
---
That macro casts Berserker Stance if you're in combat and Charge if you're not, but only if you are in Battle Stance.
---
What if they shard and I wanna play with a friend? 
---
Sure, having Classic CE would be nice. I don't see problem with that. 
---
Human Warlock, I leveled him to 39 and then rerolled as mage and levelled a human mage to 60 and then a tauren druid to 60. 
---
That was before Warlocks got their vanilla rework. I enjoyed those first two characters but I LOVED my druid. It was so fun. 
---
The System of a Down shirt really ties this all together 
---
Ah the wall of no. Makes me giggle going back and looking at them now. Such a great feeling proving them wrong
---
You don’t notice the mess while being surrounded by kobolds in goldshire. 
---
Definitely no extent photos of me from that time period. My girlfriend, who I lived with, despised WoW until she realized that she could watch all her Thai soap operas whenever she wanted. Then she didnt mind, lol. With that said, we eventually realized that we really had nothing in common and she moved out. Thankfully, WoW was still there. 
---
Then Cata came and that, quite frankly, was one of the worst breakups I've ever had in my life and I'm not exaggerating in the least, lol...but no seriously it broke me
---
This was picture was taken post LAN. There was more than just wow on the cards so I don’t think CT had a chance to set in properly. 
---
Portal roulette is a time-honored tradition, especially at the end of guild raids.
---
I think sharding in barrens is overkill. Pserver have huge populations at launch, I don't think Classic servers will have 10k+ people on a server. Also pserver players usually know how to play and get to barrens rather quickly while in classic there will be a ton of people who level very slowly and a lot of tourists won't even reach barrens.
---
There is also another problem with barrens because it's so huge that sharding would make it pretty empty after people get to 20+ and are spread out in the zone.

People screaming out against sharding at the start don't really have a strong argument when there was never this massive influx of people at the start of wow, it's just a part that never existed and can't be recreated. You can't have a #nochanges start to wow because the circumstances are so different in the real world.

Straight up dude. I just got a job that has PTO but I have 1 day a week off. I’m definitely gonna take at least 2 days. Even if I have to use a sick day.

Then what about the launcher client that comes in the zip file of the 1.12 download?
---
1. Just make friends with a fury warrior and spam DME jump runs. These can be done in ~10 minutes per run with a good duo.
---
2. Make friends with 4 fury warriors and spam Live Strat speed runs. These can be done in ~10 minutes with a good duo.

On second thought maybe we should all just roll fury warriors...

Tons of shit from my playlist. I was listening to Sex Toyz by Brokencyde the other day and it immediately had me thinking of questing in the plaguelands near Lake Darrowmere because that's where I was when I first heard it. Lot of stuff from Eminems Relapse album makes me think of questing on my gnome dk in Hellfire peninsula. Evanescence's Open Door album songs bring me to questing in Mulgore.
---
Can you actually explain what you mean by no ? Because I've been playing on those servers everyday for the last 2 years and its definitely got spell batching. I'd legitimately like to understand what makes you say they dont. 
---
I'm one of those with a problem with names. I've sometimes spent hours trying to come up with the perfect name for an alt. I might end up having to reserve a few just so I don't run into that problem.
---
&gt; by Brokencyde the other day 
---
That’s a band name I haven’t heard in over a decade
---
holy shit. it's been 8 freaking years...
---
Wow. This is crazy. These will go for ridiculous amounts at the start of the game? What level enchanting do you need? Mats? 
---
For most people, tailoring isn't a good money maker. Gear wise, it's not great unless you're undergeared and ZG is out. Is Robe of the Arch Mage a great item? It obviously is. Is the robe alone worth 1 of your 2 precious profession slot? Not so obvious.
---
If you're a baller, you can level tailoring, craft the robe, drop tailoring and keep using the robe. Is it worth doing that?  If you're a no-lifer, it could be.
---
Right lol, it's one of those songs that have been on my playlist for about that long but always tends to fly under the radar when I go to delete songs I'm not into anymore.
---
If you want to make money cooking fishing is required. It's nice to have a bunch of food while leveling that also gives you a buff so I would suggest it. You have to grind enough to get decent amounts of meat so it's not so bad till you hit mid 40s in my experience. 
---
First aid is so much more important in Vanilla where not every class has a healing ability and mobs do so much damage. You can also bandage your void and to cut down on leveling time you can life tap and bandage the life back.
---
If you hold the right mouse button down they'll strafe automatically. 
---
Woah, that laptop must have been a beast. Since not many of those had great specs at 2005
---
No not really. Classic is all about us being in a big world and learning about it while doing it, it's not a story-driven mmo and it shouldn't be tried to make like it.
---
Yoshida Brothers - Frontier takes me to TBC hellfire peninsula.
---
Just accepted a new job and will have no time accrued to take off. Feels bad!
---
Idk if it's worth the cost, but if you're leveling ahead of most people, you could probably make a lot of gold on server launch selling bags and then drop it once people get all bagged up. The robes would also be a plus.
---
There's no way to play Classic before launch and no one on this sub should be vouching for private servers as they're illegal and break ToS.
---
No you just hold your right mouse button down and they strafe. 
---
You should definitely play some classic but try to follow a few rules. First figure out what your main is going to be in classic, mines a dwarf hunter.
---
- only play the opposite faction, I’m playing horde
---
- play opposite roles, I leveled a prot warrior and a holy priest
---
- don’t go past level 20ish, you will start spoiling things, just make a new character
---
If you do this you will scratch the itch to play, without spoiling anything in classic. It took me average about 20hours to get to lvl 20, just goofing around, pvping and leveling profs. Say you make 4 characters to 20, that’s 80 hours. You play 2 hours a day 5 days a week, that’s 8 weeks.
---
Boom hello classic!
---
You won't play the game at launch because it would be too smooth, so you will never play the game? Seems a bit drastic for the 1 day hectic pserver launch that you miss.
---
As he said, they have the original BUILD, not the SOURCE CODE. There’s a massive difference. 
---
What you're describing sounds a lot like OpenRaid and oQueue from MoP. Don't know if they'll make a comeback for classic, but the main idea has already been done successfully before. They were both pretty popular before blizzard's in-game matchmaking made them obsolete.
---
There won’t be many tourists, most of them will migrate.
---
It wasn't too bad actually.  I ended up getting one of those cooling bases eventually with fans built into it because of how hot it would get.  But overall the thing never blue screened until tBC.  Thinking back it was probably the most reliable piece of electronics I had owned.
---
Dell inspiron 9000.  Can't find any info on specs prior to the 9300, but they all seem about right.
---
The OT?
---
The entire Black Holes and Revelations album by Muse and the entire Sound of Revenge album by Chamillionaire. Listened to these a ton while raiding back in the day.
---
Depends, you might not want to get burn out.  
---
  I'm using it to test out race combos, animations and what not and see what I truly want to go for, don't want to reroll when I'm level 40.  
---
Yes. Private servers have a finished cake, not the individual ingredients necessary to bake a cake.
---
If they wanted to add more strawberries to the cake it would be impossible since the cake is already made.
---
That´s because sharding was introduced in Legion. It was the first expansion that used the system and it´s exactly why the launch went so smoothly.
---
I'd buy it in a heartbeat, and I would imagine a bunch of people would as well.
---
Please explain the difference... Programming is very foreign to me.
---
It depends.. If you do choose to "play vanilla", expect whatever server you play on to shutdown permanently when classic releases. And it's very possible, even likely, that it will be **shutdown** by blizzard themselves weeks or months before the release of classic since they will not abide any competition. So, if you do decide to get your "fix" in, go in knowing it may be very, very short lived.
---
He got that at their show which happened to be nearby that year.  Good times all around.  Met some great WoW players, experienced college, met my wife.  All great things.
---
 This is a great idea, I'm trying Hunter a bit  to see if I like it because I want to try something new, L5 and dead zone is killing me so far heheh
---
Well it depends 
---
It’s 1% dodge on NE
---
It’s remove bleed/poison on dwarf
---
Its escape artist on gnome (pvp) 
---
It’s 5 higher weapon skill on humans
---
Dodge only becomes an issue one you dodge to much.  It’s basically letting you migrate some avoidance to hit gear in the beginning it’s not that important it allows you to take other choices in some cases.  But being able to reach 1% higher avoidance is never wrong. 
---
The dwarf skill is very useful in AQ with all that poison and good vs rogues 
---
Gnomes is fun from two perspective the skill is great from a pvp perspective. And as a bonus some weapons don’t scale down to gnome size meaning it looks like a a anime with oversize weapon.  
---
Human on the other hand hands out maxes/swords weaponskill meaning that you don’t have to stack that as high.  
---
Remember the mantra 
---
avoidance cap to be uncrittable
---
Then get hit so you can keep Aggro 
---
and then stack hp
---
From a pve perspecive obly gnomes are falling behind as the bleed/poison immunity is great.  
---
The fans have won nothing yet. If those of us going back with huge nostalgia boners manage to create server communities where old and new players can get a fix of that old-school mmo charm, everyone wins. 
---
Classic could still fail, and fail hard, in many ways. The servers could become cesspools of toxicity, and one might even argue are quite likely to. The sub requirement, the slower pace, the "been there, done that" and a host of other factors might still prove the "you think you do"-crowd right. 
---
At its best, World of Warcraft had life and activity throughout the world and across the level ranges. That life was in large part created by a lot of noobs, and boy was I one, running about with no clue about what I was doing. 
---
It'll be interesting to see how the old mechanics mesh with the older, more jaded playerbase. Who, for example, will just guild up with people they already know and stick to themselves? Who will give that Wrath-baby hunter a pass for needing on that polearm? ("We went over the great "What is a hunter weapon?"-debate a thousand times already!") Who will give the nervous warrior the time to get a hang of tanking multiple mobs? Will any of us have any patience?
---
Still looking forward to it though. 
---
yeah exactly, i think it's totally justified for 1-10 or maybe even 1-20, but not after that. i'm not really sure how well it worked for fostering a sense of community because i remember dalaran being packed but barely seeing any players out in the world on day 1 (moon guard, horde is kinda dead but plenty of alliance) tho tbh that could also be because you have no incentitive to interact with them and so i kindve tunnel visioned them out beyond the novelty of seeing another horde player. 
---
ANYWAYS my point is that even despite that, i'd rather be able to play the game when it launches, there will be plenty of opportunities to make friends. inb4 ''REAL GAMERS love waiting in queues''
---
With darkmoon card, 20 spirit is equal to an item with 12,5mp5 +5 healing given the card procc or outside of 5 second rule. 
---
That is alot better than fear ward on fights that do not have the fear mechanism (which is most of the fights).
---
Master fisherman and cook, reporting in! Definitely an aspect of the game that quite a few players ignore, unfortunately (I mained a mage and I really began to despise the huge number of people begging for food since they never learned to cook).
---
Best early money-maker: Savory Deviant Delight which drops randomly off any mob in the Barrens, great if you're Horde but really hard to get a hold of as Alliance (if you are Alliance, this also means you can sell the food \[never the recipe!!\] for quite a bit since people love dressing up as a ninja/pirate). 
---
End-game, I did do the crazy epic quest to get the [Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8586). In my opinion, it's not that worth it unless a few people in you guild are actively supporting you. Most other food is sufficient for raids. Stamina and spirit food types are really all you need to keep your guild happy.
---
Yes, people in the same group are always put on the same shards. The game also puts people from the same guilds on the same shards (if possible), so you are more likely to run into people from your guild in the world.
---

Activison is confirmed to be at E3 2019... maybe then if they haven't already?
---
You can level yourself a mage for portals and water, and a warlock or two to summon you and your friends. It’s helpful but not necessary really.
---
I somehow got to level 40-something &amp; then re-rolled as an Orc Warrior &amp; haven’t looked back from the warrior ways since 
---
Nostalrius had 800k created accounts over year and a half of its duration. Only 150k of those were active in the last month.
---
Now imagine if it was advertised by Blizzard and every Retail player could start playing on Nostalrius by clicking one button.
---
My advice is that you should really avoid playing Vanilla or even watching guides for your future character. That way you will have a little feeling of discovery again when you start in Classic. I know it's very hard but at the end you'll be rewarded greatly for it :)
---
Not disagreeing with you, just pointing out that most fights do not have that mechanism.
---
Did something similar, because I couldn't make up mind. 
---
I have not regretted my choice so far. 
---
Prepare your inbox..
---
Im #nochanges all the way for classic to work but damn...some things would be really cool to have &amp; would take the good old game to an even greater level. In an ideal scenario I’d like a tweaked version of vanilla after classic with things such as guild housing etc, would have been amazing really!
---
Indifferent, either way would be fine with me, since I'm not interested.
---
XD iknorite?
---
I'll happily join in later, probably once Sharding has been removed. It's just that Sharding to preserve the solo experience at launch removes the things that make launch week in particular interesting to me, so my options are either: subpar but ordinary solo gameplay at launch (due to lack of guilds/high level players/economy) or a normal experience a week or two later.
---
The other things that make launch week special don't really appeal to me, as I'm not interested in the race to 60 or going for any world firsts.
---
Actually, come to think of it, sharding itself isn't a dealbreaker for me - it's the size of the shards. If they're just using sharding to bring things down from like, 600 players per zone to 150, I'd still join at launch for that.
---
Hi, /u/gael_the_druid
---
Sorry for the inconvenience, but we don't allow posts encouraging the use of private servers, so I've removed your post. Please try r/wowservers.
---
FYI: if I could go back in time and pay WoW for the first time, I'd do it in official Classic servers. Basically, I'd wait and not touch a private server if I had no experience with Vanilla.
---
You could use one to powerlevel the other if you weren't leveling them at the same time. 
---
You might enjoy playing the Warcraft 3 campaigns, especially if you’ve never played the game before. They’re a lot of fun and a great primer on the lore. 
---
One of the things I loved most about WoW when I started playing was encountering all these characters and places that I was so familiar with from the first three Warcraft games. 
---
There are also a stack of fantastic custom campaigns available for WC3 that immerse you in all sorts of storylines from the Warcraft universe.

---
Are so many mobs in vanilla ranged casters?
---
Or were you able to wand while someone was meeleing you?
---
Everything, eventually.
---
The point of sharding isn't primarily to make it easier for you to find mobs to kill and quest items to loot. It's about when the tourists leave, and mitigating the effect that the exodus will have on server populations. 
---
Hmmmm I see your angle but it's Warcraft. There's an insane amount of lore. 
---
You can thoroughly enjoy the game without knowing a thing about the world though as I did 10 years ago. No harm in finding another angle to hype people in though.

eh, it should not be needed for too long. And many people are complaining even with a fixed time limit, how do you think they would react to a variable one.
---
Anyway, the issue is not just tourists, but tourists+launch hype. Even if some retail players will keep leveling after the first few, they will likely do it spread out over time. Basically a tourist will likely play in off hours, and much less than dedicated fans.
---
Listening to any Blind Guardian album. A Twist in the myths reminds me of running RFK over and over. good times.
---
Did you honestly just try and use rewardment as a word...
---
Troll shaman
---
A lot more of the pve only players were on pvp servers back then. 
---
Like a LARGE amount of players clicked their spells, big disadvantage. 
---
This is fuck all to do with servers in the cloud. Where did this idea stem from that current cloud servers are somehow worse than dedicated servers? They run on the same hardware except you don't need to outright purchase a server if you use one in the cloud.
---
Blizzard current servers lag when many people come together in one place because there is never a time that is meant to happen in retail, so they don't account for it when selecting the power of the server. Just a quick look on AWS options and they have servers with 128 cpus (which will blow away 2006 era cpus) and 1,982GBs of ram. Compare this to the 2 AMD Opterons (2.2Ghz) and 6GB of ram that were found when someone took apart an original server blade that they bought.
---
This meme needs to die. Cloud computing is not "shit compared to dedicated", Blizzards choice of how to optimise it is shit compared to how they used to. Simply because people don't interact like they used to, so there is no point in them spending the extra money when they can just run up a second shard and phase people out when needed. 
---
You do not need fishing to reach 300 cooking. Sure, it helps, but plenty of people don't have the patience and think that means they have to miss out on cooking. You CAN max out cooking without fishing.
---
That said, if you're doing it for money then you probably want to pick up fishing.
---
From 1.11 onwards one potential source of income is fishing up Deviate Fish and cooking them in to Savory Deviate Delight.

Oh my god, I forgot all the desk real-estate we had to give to our huuuuuge CRTs...

Look up a video on hunter pet trainable traits as well as unique pets then add the extra dimension of acquiring new ranks of the abilities.

Yep. I downloaded it back in the vanilla days. But eventually deleted it because it was too confusing lol.
---
but it's Sunday
---
Well if you actually take the time to read through my post you’ll see I never use “rewardment”, I was merely responding to a comment that used it, and as a way a properly responding I used it. Pay some attention next time, cheers. 
---
From what classic wow personalities and streamers say, he doesn’t plan on playing. 
---
I also recall a clip where he downplays classic and makes a case for TBC being the games best state. The addition of arenas being a big part of why. It may have been an upload to YouTube. 
---
Comparing it to Pservers is absolutely pointless as I’ve stared other places on this forum. The draw of WoW Classic extends past just Pserver vets.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture. Might I suggest "Iridium - 12,000 suns"? Used to be my go-to track when I wanted to do some chill farming.
---
reported for reporting
---
Clearly I wasn’t talking to you then fuckwit 
---
They already confirmed that collectables, transmogs etc will not transfer between classic and bfa, so I'd be up for a boxed collectors edition if the loot was sufficient.
---
For example, a real cloth map (not a paper one), an in game early blizzcon item, and/or a signed autograph from Brack saying "I was wrong."
---
On that topic, won't power leveling services be a plague in classic now that everyone knows how to power level and not against the rules?
---
**NO CHA**- oh ok actually yeah I can let this one slide 
---
Pretty sure you can wand in melee range although it has been forever ... they dont have the same deadzone/target too close that bows/guns had.
---
Death is a much more occurring thing. I'd say quite a big percentage of  your play time will be spent in ghost form. Also graveyards were not positioned optimally in Vanilla which meant a stupid death could cause you a 5 or even 10 minute walk depending on zone and which areas you've explored.
---
That's why the NumLock button is the literal MVP of WoW buttons.

100% my worry too.
---
You kill the bad bois and you get the XP’s 
---
Harsh Truth:  Killing tons of furbolgs in Felwood to get rep for Timbermaw hold was not "fun" or "exciting" it was just plain boring.  And that is far from the only thing that is boring/monotonous in classic.  Have to take the good with the bad.
---
Total annihilation was one of the early vids that really got me into PvP. But like a lot of people had said the competition back then was much worse. Players like grim and vurtne were way ahead of their time. 
---
Priest having no AoE besides holy nova, which was awful. Rogues having 0 AoE at all. 
---
It's not the black &amp; white and if you work with cloud systems, you know this. Our realms/shards are likely in a kubernetes-microservice architecture - compared to the tin solution they had in 06 that means your servers are most likely very limited in terms of resource allocation on an individual level, but the architecture is designed to span, contract &amp; heal itself as it needs to. 
---
&gt; Cloud computing is not "shit compared to dedicated"
---
Never said this. As I said in the previous post, it *is* likely a limitation of their chosen cloud *architecture.* Which, as they've said they would like sharding to exist in some places at the very least in the beginning, it makes sense to think they would be approaching this rollout with a similar setup in mind. 
---
Fuck me that was like 3-4 years of my life from bc to wotlk. Then my sister started raiding and we did 2-3 hours each

High school ruined my WoW life.  So much time wasted on school argh!

I'd recommend watching some of SoupaSoka's leveling series. He is super chill and makes nice content. I feel like a lot of youtubers min max a lot, which might be a little over the top for a beginner.

that's fuckin fifty die kie pie minus!

Hi, /u/vnv9

I guess ur sick on your Thursday and Friday
---
Yeah, I was that bad rogue nobody knew about 
---
After long consideration and realistic expectations to how much time I will have and what I want to achieve, I'm currently with Troll Hunter.
---
Played Warlock and Priest back in the days, not sure I feel like not playing a clothie anymore this time around. However staying true to Horde, always. 
---
Priest tank, or warrior healer.
---
Wow my parents didn’t let me play WoW til I was 14
---
Most people here aren’t German, but there is a dude called Jam Hegenberg who composed a few awesome WoW songs:
---
-Die Horde Rennt (The Horde Marches)  
---
-Die Allianz schlägt zurück (The Alliance strikes back)  
---
-Die Garde der Hoffnung (Guardians of Hope)
---
Those are the 3 best ones but there are a few more that are good as well, even if you don’t understand German it’s worth checking out!
---
Dwarf paladin (2) &gt; Night elf druid (12) &gt; Gnome warlock (12) &gt; Human paladin (29) &gt; Tauren shaman (33) &gt; Undead mage (60)  
---
For some reason I really thought I was a person who likes hybrids. Then I ran into the mage. I'm actually amazed I never got hooked on the warlock, but I actually blame Dun Morogh (my most hated start zone)  
---
.8 x .8 x .8 = .512 chance for no crts in 3 strikes
---
I leveled 3 characters to 60 and 1 to around 50 and during that time I think I had 1 BoE epic drop.  Saw maybe a couple more while doing lvl 60 dungeons.
---
I’m convinced everyone’s first toon was a NE hunter, even if they only played them for a little while before rolling another toon lol. When pulling the game up, they are just the coolest looking models at that point in time. 
---
Looks like he was doing some good ol' "Henewhoring".
---
Maybe 1-2 nights a week I would go herbing for an hour or two at Winterspring and get pretty much everything I needed for that weeks raiding.  Repair bills as a priest were pretty low so I never really noticed the gold cost and made all my own consumables and occasionally sold additional herbs/potions on the side.  Priests are pretty easy on consumables though.
---
Blade flurry is actually good enough for Rogues to be able to do a solid aoe pull every two minutes.
---
Possibilities:  
---
Having a bank toon scanning the AH while you do your own thing  
---
Multiboxing for pvp shenanigans  
---
Multibox to level faster so you have farming alts/profession CD alts with less time investment  
---
Multibox healer+warrior for open-world duoing on your main  
---
Optional utility alt. Portals+mage food; warlock summon + healthstone; buffs

Evanescence - "Wake me up Inside", I recall listening to it when WOW was installing

Also, when my new house was being built, there was always radio playing on the construction site. And Era - "Ameno" played day and night. 
---
In the old house, I played until early WotLK. Patch 3.0.9 or something.
---
In the new house, once they connected the Internet, it was 3.3 already.
---
The old house was so much happier.
---
&gt; Damn I was youing! Lol
---
And fucking beautiful
---
&gt; This means you can spent a couple G at gear 
---
ie the shadoweave items or whatever it called cuz they are also kinda preraid gear
---
I'll be having two accounts, one for my warrior tank and one for all my alts. I plan on leveling a mage (dungeon farming, food, portals) hunter (Maraudon farming in case they nerf DM/ZG), warlock (summons and chill), rogue (main alt, lock picking) and a healer, either priest or shaman to 60. They'll all have some sort of money making professions as well. 
---
I plan to go hard throughout all of Classic.
---
I still do this, I never learn.
---
cant u buy the recipe in the neutral AH?
---
You're right, forgot to invert the final number
---
Class envy is a good thing. It means the game is so well designed that you will always have that little want underneath to play other classes. Unlike the opposite, such as current wow, where I don't wanna play anything because they all feel mundane and similar. You'll always want to play other classes just go with the one that you want slightly more, that really speaks to you and don't worry bout the envy.
---
In the demo they had updated graphics (better shadows, shades, more grass etc) which was toggleable. However no sign of modern models/rigging/animations. I think it's fair to assume this will be how it is on release. I'm not sure if retail has all the assets needed for classic. If it does I would think a swap button would be a nice, but I the fact it wasn't in the demo suggests it's not so simple. 
---
Word of advice. If you only have so little make sure you dont take the very first day off, probably wont happen since blizzard should have the hardware but first day launches dont always go to plan. For classic I'd say itll be server queues till they open more. 
---
You'll get more bang for your day off if you wait 2-3 days
---
Yeah I feel that way but ultimately no matter what I go I will make it work so it really won't matter in the long run.  Generally being able to show up, listen, and follow directions in groups/raids is the most important thing, not what class you are.  I probably won't really know for sure what I am going to go until I actually reach the character select screen.
---
and  the prayer heal  being only for ur own party
---
Well i just tested it on windows 10 pro. it completely froze my pc and my desktop went black. Every time i turned on my computer i had 10-15seconds before the screen went all black and shut down 😅 managed to change UI in those 10 seconds to fix the issue. (In case anyone else just tried it)  
---
yes the weapon isnt actually meant to be used at 30 soloing it XD which is why its so strong
---
bummer
---
both options are shit. you are horde and almost no hitgear is available. dreadforge retaliator would be a far better option.
---
ppl like to be idealistic. let me tell you some reality. cos its important to know, cos vanilla such a heavy time investement, and you need to know what you get into. and when i first started playing classic on ps, i rolled a druid aswell, having some bright hope and dreams.
---
1. no revive. So for 5mans ppl in many cases take other healer over you. aswell some ppl just reject you. "LF1M healer" -"hey, i can go im a druid" -"no sry, not a druid". (cos no revive and weaker heal). so be ready for that. some ppl will take you, some wont. the playable group for a druid to have one of dpses shaman, shadowpriest, or paladin. so they can revive in a group. in classic wow, run back are VERY long especially if you are deep in the dungeon already. and ppl do happen to die. and need revive. or always waiting for ppl running back is a liability noone wants, then they asspull some patrol, lost their way and so on. its a pain. then mobs may respawn, its terrible.
---
2. in 5mans you think you gonna prehot like in later addons - nope. (and you need to be careful with using hots in general, and cant just spam them left and right). Cos you just risking to instantly pulling threat on mobs. its not woltk or modern wow. tanks lack aoe threat, they need to hit every mob and gather them, it takes time, and ingeneral threat is harder to manage and get on a multiple mobs.
---
so hoting is a risk of pulling mobs to you and fucking the whole pull and the group. and wiping.
---
3. druids have no fast cast heal, and therefore a slow ability to react to enviroment fast, both pvp, pve, raids or instances. 
---
raids - "ok this guy lacking some health let me cast my heal"  (start casting) casting casting "nvm, he is already got healed by other healers". ok this guy.. - nvm already healed and so on.
---
pvp - ok this dude taking damage, let me cast my heal. casting casting casting, nvm he is already dead.
---
its terrible and frustrating. happens more than regulary, and its literally a druid gameplay in a nutshell. (just in case all other healers got quite powerful 1.5 heal cast).
---
4. their hps is just low. In 90% of cases you will hang in the bottom end of hps meter. no matter how much you try, or how better of a player you are compared to other healers.
---
which is very frustrating aswell.
---
they are objectively less effective healer than all 3 other healer. to the point that some top guilds druid buff outside of the raid, then swap druid out. wth for would you want a druid over a priest or shaman or paladin. some exmaple: https://youtu.be/yik2uNTDWCE - plz count amount of druids in the raid (druids are orange frame). yup 0. thats how good they are... 
---
5. they have only 3 main healing spells: healing touch (3 secs cast time), regrowth (2sec cast time + hot), rejuvenation (hot). 
---
and also Nature swiftness (isntant cast healing touch) with 2min cd. and tranquility (8min cd).
---
unless you get uber geared hots tick for not much, they tick quite slowly aswell (no scaling with haste or anything like taht added in later addons, no lifebloom obviously aswell), and so you mostly will be healing with long ass casttime healing touch. 1 spell, cool?
---
you have different ranks but still.
---
also anyone will be talking about regrowth spec. its non blizzlike on private server, regrowth +spd counted twice.
---
Because classic 
---
No it wasn't, it's just pservers
---
Bonus: [This guy's GM being wrongfully banned four times, had to call Blizzard to seemingly "whitelist" his nickname. That's four times that clearly no action was taken against the multiboxer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/b7h3rj/the_multiboxer_reporting_exploit_is_so_broken/ejsly1f/)
---
We can't have this system in classic. People will spam report each other over devilsaurs, or report the enemy guild's main tank as they're doing world bosses etc.. The potential for abuse in classic is way, _way_ higher than retail.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but their servers really do suck. I was literally lagging with 20 people on my screen as opposed to the hundreds in one area on private servers.
---
I really wonder why its not more popular
---
Ive never heard of this before
---
You can wand, it doesn't get cancelled at all. Only when you're stunned.
---
the tricky thing is getting a raid spot in the first
---
but then you dont compete with many of ur class maybe 3-4 people
---
You can put the points in demo as you like. Curse of exhaustion is for elites, you guys can kite and kill elites with it. 
---
So whatsup with the stormcrow shapeshit description on the druids?
---
Contrary to popular belief, you can manage to get quite far in raiding. However, its not for the faint of heart and demands you to put in the effort. I grabbed it up a year ago and its a blast to play. 
---
I am in the classic discord https://discord.gg/classicwow voice channel if you want to chat and learn more about it.
---
There's so many songs I can relate to vanilla wow but to name a few of them:
---
* Breaking Benjamin - So Cold &amp; Diary of Jane
---
* Tool (whole 10 000 Days album)
---
* A Perfect Circle - The Outsider
---
* Hoobastank - Crawling In The Dark
---
* Sonic Syndicate - Denied
---
* 30 Seconds To Mars - Attack
---
* Muse - New Born (And "Bliss" as well)
---
* The Ataris - So Long Astoria
---
* Thrice - T&amp;C
---
* Soilwork - Stabbing The Drama
---
* Silverstein - My Heroine
---
* Anti-Flag - 911 For Peace
---
Obviously the grotesquely wide buttergolem who hurt himself using compressed air to clean out his computer.

I didn't even consider that that was a question.
---
I think it would be cool to get Oxhorn on some of the podcasts we have.
---
Ahh wrong music =(
---
So many of his videos were uploaded with changed music due to copyright.
---
Regardless of what people tought of Grim the dude could edit. He'd put quite a few current you-tubers to shame xD
---
So what are you grabbing with that spec? Improved Eyes of the Beast, TSA, Clever Traps + Deterrence?
---
Now this is like classic WoW
---
Multiboxing 5 ele shamans and laughing at people every time you press chain lightning 
---
The experience is smoother and allows you to time easier in pvp for sure. HOwever I feel like this is actually more realistic, that after the cast/charge/vanish goes off the effect isn't exactly instantaneous, two warriors charging for instance seems to make sense to me.
---
I was 10 and I made a nelf druid named Nightmare 
---
&gt; paladin has 10 min buffs
---
Palas have a 5 min blessing and 15min greater blessing.
---
Caster Druid Tank wielding Ragnaros and having the Flame Buffet debuff on boss. Funnily enough, it works...
---
Ironic.
---
The other races didn’t exactly look stealthy, so I think people rolled Undead for the sleeker look.
---
If by sleeker look you mean Will of the Forsaken then probably.
---
Luckily nobody will have ridiculous amounts of money so the price won't be too much. Personally I'll be levelling my alt 1-10 (hunter) then parking it in an inn for rested. I'll grab a wand off the AH then switch to my priest, there's no way I'll level without a wand!
---
Unless you plan on tanking endgame, I just don't see the point. I know I can't do it again. Just thinking about the old repair bills...
---
exactly which?
---
I don't see any validation though that these reports are even true. Which I feel is important to have any value in a discussion.  
---
I can type here "I was forced to do a name change by a multiboxer last night through right clock reporting" Whilst not being remotely true. Both of the post you link don't even offer a shred of evidence that it isn't atleast (partially) made up. And a lot of stuff like this gets made up sadly. 
---
It wouldn't be the first time reports like this turned out to be blatant lies. For example the guy that claimed (somewhere around X-mas i think) to be banned for doing "world PVP", he claimed that he got banned due to right click reporting by ppl he ganked in PVP. Turned out he got banned because he was harrasing ppl via the ingame mail system. 
---
Don't pay then! 
---
they are strong like hunter or warlock but without the pet hassle
---
and compared to melees they are more forgiving in mistakes
---
Hey! This is wild. I’m currently listening to you on countdown to classic as I saw this post. Small world. 
---
Hang in there!
---
Straight to video
---
lifedrain is a hell of a drug
---
“Meme specs” are hated because everyone else has to carry you. You contribute nothing vital hence make everyone else have to out put more to make up for it. Just something to be aware of. Groups are doing you a favor inviting you, not the other way around.
---
I swear I could do the MC corpse run in my sleep
---
I had both cooking and fishing maxed.
---
Worked on cooking because I liked completing my recipe list.
---
Hated fishing. I think I finally ended up finishing maxing it to fish up Gaz in ZG, or maybe get fish for buffs.
---
5-10 days playtime to 60?! Wasn't the world record like 5 days /played? My first was like 17 days, second was like 15.
---
Personally, I like https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxVZVVoZGxbVohux which allows me to tank.
---
For real. Try MC without fire resist. I dare you.
---
just remember, you have to hit ur allies with it for it to generate threat, not the mobs.
---
hi fellow classic enthousiasts, are there any resources available out there telling us what spells we can safely not buy while leveling to min-max our gold?
---
I have never gotten to see a boe epic drop in Vanilla or BC, not even on private servers with a couple of 60’s...  :( I wish to see it happen some day! 
---
Which section of 1-60 has the most "grinding"? Are there specific level ranges where we need to kill dem boars?
---
What is love?
---

Having trouble navigating through reddit mate? Or maybe reading is what you're having troubles with?  
---
Try again. One is regarding Journey, one about Joanna.
---
Did pure PVE DPSing, which Horde race is the best for Rogue? Seems like it would be Troll.
---
trolls make for awesome tanks.
---
I have somewhat of the same problem. My GF, whom I play BfA with, swears I’ll quit classic within a month. I have no other friends playing wow. 
---
So I decided I was going to make a guild! I have convinced some of my irl friends to atleast try it on launch and recruited my current raid leader and some randoms from the interwebs. 
---
Thing is OP, you can find likeminded people before and after launch, and will most create new friends along the way to 60. 
---
Yesss, MSI. My farming music!
---
Mine was called ‘guildbank’ and I’d accept invites to random guilds that were spammed in Org. I tried to convince people to send crafting mats to me, but usually got kicked right after :D
---
Actually keeps me from making a mage. They look homeless til Naxx (which will be a long ass time) plus they have the most boring "rotation" in MC and BWL.
---
Mute &gt; all of em
---
Would Enchanting would be viable while leveling? Like not only to have it for DE, but like to enchant/make stuff and charge for it?  
---
I'm thinking of going skinning+enchanting on a Human Rogue, but I read people saying Enchanting is not worth it if you're leveling it, only for DE.
---
Warlock pet damage talent spec, as orc for racial pet damage, with the BWL trinket and the ZG set bonus for pet damage. I’m keen to see how much damage I can get an imp or succubus to pump out
---
TFW you fake being sick on a maintenance day 
---
If we dont have progressive itemization then the Thistle tea recipe will be BoP meaning only rogues will have it.
---
That is unfortunate for those who enjoy collecting all recipes.
---
You're right, people love to make shit up when they get banned. And they usually get called out on it. But that almost never happens to these particular threads. Why? The nice(?) thing about this particular system is that it's very easy to prove that this is possible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI
---
Baby dont hurt me
---
I know enchanting is nice if you are a priest because your leveling will heavily depend on your wand - and you can basically just craft yourself the best wands available along the way
---
Human or Gnome for warlock? 
---
There are litterally videos showing people doing it to troll others
---
I can’t help but think that you dont know that most people were keyboard turners in Vanilla...
---
Now *that's* how I envisioned the typical Alliance player back in the day. 
---
Its very profitable to "smuggle" Hord only or Alliance only Pattern through the neutral actions house, like http://classicdb.ch/?item=7290 It become mutch more easy if you have a toon on both the alliance side and hord side.
---
I reckon stance dancing for warriors wasn't a big thing after vanilla/tbc.   
---
Rogues had to use vanishing powder or something like that to use vanish.   
---
Hunters had to feed their pets to keep them loyal, or they'd abandon you. 
---
Can't think of more atm. 
---
That still doesn't prove most of these stories though, i know that silencing is possible. We did that the day the system was implemented, just like Asmon in his movie. However you needed a lot more than 5 ppl to get someone silenced. 
---
More recently (around the time of the X-mas report i've rwitten about above), we also tried to see if we could get someone banned (a new account made by a guildie) and we couldn't get this to happen, no matter how many reports we threw at it. 
---
Thats why i'm very skeptical about ppl claiming to get banned by just 5 persons. 
---
https://youtu.be/kuPEzEoexLI
---
Vanilla video showing /sit proccing reckoning
---
Alot of the confusion here is that reckoning/redoubt are the only abilities that work this way. Other  on critted effects eg enrage eye of the storm dont work on /sit
---
Addons ruin the game more than they provide. I'd like to see them ban all addons other than dps, threath an ui (bartender ect). Figth me
---
Yeah, I saw the other comments after I dropped mine :p
---
One point for keeping the price is that they would compete against their own product. If a good 15% of players say: "Fuck it, WoW is WoW" and switch from retail to vanilla to play WoW for a discount price, they just shot themselves in the foot by 15% of the playerbase paying x amount less for vanilla than for retail.
---
See my newe reply, we literally tried it with a fresh account and we couldn't make it happen (a part from the silence).
---
Well, the difference it like if you wanted to rebuild an old car. Having a build of the car would be an old copy of the car you could look at while having the source code would be like having a manual explaning exactly how to do it.
---
Could you link me a talent tree and how’d you build it through leveling? I’m intrigued. Is there any more info on this hybrid spec? I’m only used to ele/resto spec with the occasional 2h staff with windfury against casters.
---
Man i actually remember the crows roost tavern thread in the rp forums. Good fun
---
People probably just never thought about it. Honestly, it was a coincidence that my friend and I discovered it. It's also not really viable to get if you're trying to rush to level cap, because there are no one high level enough out there to help you get it.
---
How much does investing some talent points in the protection spec help a warrior who just got level 60 when tanking dungeons? I'm going to do a lot of dungeons with my friends as soon as I turn 60, and combining that with battlegrounds and wpvp. Will it be fine to just use a cookie-cutter arms pvp spec, considering we will all be pretty badly geared?
---
Gotta sort those priorities!
---
I look forward to spawn camping him, sorry if I’m being ‘mockful’
---
Gotta do the sprit staff wielding warrior meme
---
Can you slow fall from Tanaris into Un'goro with only one slow fall cast at the very top?
---
Will my Shaman benefit from skinning/leatherwork more or mining/smithing in terms of both moneymaking and armour Crafting during leveling and at 60.
---
Thanks, even a link to a video guide would be awesome!
---
It doesn't matter as you 99% of the time won't get the howl, as your pet will be in melee range, benefiting them
---
PvP videos gave me my taste of music
---
Don’t hurt me
---
This has been heavily debated, but look at Pserver numbers (uncertain) the difference is negligible in naxx gear, and survival will only be worse prior to that.
---
I think it was 4 days - but 17 is quite slow (not that that’s a bad thing) but given that everyone knows a little more what to expect I think 10 is reasonable 
---
Being protection is arguably easier on the healer, but with a competent group it is never really needed. You will take a bit more damage, but the amount of damage the mobs and bosses do isn’t the problem in 5-mans, it’s usually a list of things that result in other people than the tank taking damage. 
---
TLDR; it helps some, but all pre raid content is easily tankable in any spec. 
---
&gt; you need a lot more than 5 ppl to get someone silenced
---
Got a source for that? Because in that second video, you can very clearly see &lt;10 people report an enemy in a RBG and have them kicked off.
---
&gt;we also tried to see if we could get someone banned (a new account made by a guildie) and we couldn't get this to happen
---
While most of these videos show disconnect + silences, as with all Blizzard punishments it'll probably depend on your account history. Here's the thing though, a disconnect and _a silence in Classic WoW may as well be a ban_ for many players. Not being able to chat for 24 hours means you'll be able to participate in any group content outside of your guild, and you can't engage with trading outside of AH. Being able to talk is a very, very important part of vanilla. But what's just as bad is the disconnect. Disconnecting an enemy who's tanking a world boss? Well, the damage will already be done, ban or not. World bosses like Azuregos has mechanics that means if you wipe you can't re-engage right away and you might've just given the other guild the kill.
---
Makes no arguable difference, only flavor. Gnome for escape artist (pvp and some pve encounters). Human for 10% rep bonus. 
---
Int buff is useless, warlocks will never go out of mana if played correctly.
---
It’s pretty inaccurate really, he seems to be very for classic and openly says current wow sucks 
---
Enhancement doesn't do 80% or better the DPS of a true DPS spec. It's more like 80% or better the DPS of the main tank.
---
 I think they actually re-added all the removed Fem Draenei lines *except* for the Sexodar one.
---
Usually 50-60
---
The ‘not enough quests to reach max’ tale is somewhat true, but if you run 5-mans and visit all the sones, you get there with minimal ‘grind’
---
To be fair, the typical horde player didn't look any different. And yes, I'm speaking from experience :P
---
Skinning and lw imo, there’s 3 branches of skinning and leatherworking that you can pick from, one of which being mail items. Blacksmithing becomes plate patterns past the certain level.
---
Did we really need a class officer for the feral druids?
---
Eh, as far as people who were forced to play on private servers before, this has been a win
---
Whos the eagles?
---
It's a phase later though, mostly looking for items that are out in the same patch as ZG. But thanks for your contribution though!
---
Wtf looks like you were in a poor soviet state lol
---
The can of mountain dew really brings it together 
---
no more.
---
Cool. Key word - some.
---
If a word first guild is willing to not just stack warlock and priests, everyone else can stop pretending that its the class holding them back.
---
Its like in current wow, where people call a class that sims 5% worse literally trash, when the players themselves play the class at 50-70% efficiency.
---
Unless you are top 1% it does not matter at all
---
Dwarf warrior. Stopped playing it after reaching level 50ish. Then leveled a dwarf priest to 20ish, loved playing as a priest but had burned out on dwarf animations and looks. Leveled NE priest after that, which became my main in vanilla. I also had an ud priest, but never raided on that.
---
Me and my mates will try to avoid any servers with streamers on. 
---
What people most likely get is a build up or analysis - I wouldn't put it past the report system scanning account activity after a certain number of reports look for something that was "wrong".
---
Water and shadows yes. 
---
Literally a enha shaman with bis aq40 gear, doing totally shit dps, still pulling aggro from main tank (with shamans taunt that is part of the ridiculously shitty dps rotation) and then listening to delusional noobs, who know very little about the game, but still trying to convince you that enh shaman is viable dps. (elemental shaman falls short aswell, but does significantly more than enh)
---
The silence is a pretty fucking big deal when theres no dungeon finder ect.
---
There is a vid of someone saying fuck in guild chat, they report him and he gets kicked.
---
Best part is that you have to turn off the filter to even see profanities. Its retarded imo
---
Daaaaamn!
---
Yesss this. Also can't wait to relive my gremlin days as an adult gremlin without a job.
---
How much gold can a rogue do per BRD stealth run using only pitpocketting?
---
I think you'll be fine. If you know and can execute the mechanics of ICC heroic and hardmodes, then you can do vanilla mechanics.  
---
Warrior has a few abilities in Wrath that are available to all stances, but in vanilla are confined to a single stance. It doesn't take long to get used to which ones are which.  
---
I would advise to keep an open mind about being Fury just incase you don't get to be a tank.  
---
For your last point, this is a personal opinion of mine and it will probably go against a lot of people's ideals, but I don't personally think the best raid leader is a tank. Some of the best raid leaders I've seen are people who have very simple raid roles, that way they can focus heavily on the raid as a whole. I've had a rogue and hunter raid lead and they were the best I've had, with the hunter being *the* best. On the contrary, I don't think a healer should ever be a raid leader due to the natural focus on raid frames.  
---
The key that ties my last point all together is that the tank needs to be in very close communication with the raid lead. Which means the guild needs to stfu on voice if they don't have anything to contribute.  
---
Omen of clarity is useless unless you plan on meleeing between heals though.
---
Drowning Pool - Bodies...
---
Shhhh, delete this. We don't want more people to think about this. Delete this.
---
I hope they'll eventually put in the new models/particles (as an option). So we could have the classec experience in a modern coat (IF you want to).
---
Hunters right?
---
Idk. In all my years of playing wow I've never once been banned. Is it really that common? 
---
Gnome for sure. Even though the first guy claims 5% int is bad, it's far from it. Provides you with more spell crit since it scales really well with gear and buffs. The extra mana also allows you to dish out a little more dmg before you start life tapping. Escape artist is also great for pvp.
---
I think it's probably wise not to assume the graphics in Classic will be the same as the graphics in the Classic demo last Blizzcon.
---
I’ve frequently had a second account as a permanent AH toon. You scan and repost constantly while still being able to play the game.
---
Oh god, I had no idea he was dead...
---
Mograine? Rend Blackhand?  Nathanos? 
---
Lol brutal. I bet your mom knew, laughed her way to work on those tuesdays
---
A purple dude with a knife and dingy leather armour? Nah man, gimme that big dick energy human Paladin with mutton chops and a baldspot. I was Uther's successor in every way until I got to level 33 and realized how fucking boring Paladins were. 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0MZViohthtIm0bo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0MZViohthtIm0bo)
---
Idk about later levels but when I was leveling a warlock up to about 35 on a private server, lifedrain was just so slow inefficient. I found using first aid to be a lot better, but maybe thats just me.
---
You KNOW that guy was 2200 in the first season of BC arena 
---
Yes - and I'm compiling a playlist of them.
---
The songlist is a collection of tracks from over 50 PVP/WoW videos from 2005-2007. 
---
It's not finished by any means but if you want to follow progress/give suggestions then you're more than welcome.
---
I titled it "Dancing with the Void" because to me PVP always felt like this circling dance like two players caught in a whirlpool. Just trying to keep afloat and make sure it wasn't you that went down.
---

---
Critten/Journey did 3d7h on North when it launched, that was after fixes.
---
I'd pay just for that Brack quote/autograph
---
I think they should do new ones. A floating hearthstone card lmao
---
I dont know why but Black betty by Ram Jam takes me back to Duskwood with my lvl 25 gnome mage, killing spiders.
---
If you're gonna wear BiS-items, you'll look garbage until Naxxramas (and that is only when you get there and get set items). Also you'll have the most boring rotation in MC and BWL. 
---
Some pretty big reasons for me to stay away.
---
Honor decay makes it hard to reach rank 12 if you are not able to nolife. I mean if you for some reason can’t play for a week, your progress is setback several weeks. 
---
Do you reckon Gnome Warlocks look silly with felsteed? 
---
Are there any fights where you want to use dampen magic on tanks?
---
Gnome, played vanilla warlock on pservers for 3 years. That 5% intellect increase does make a difference and escape artist is better than perception as well.
---
That 5% intellect increase is maybe one less life tap during a boss fight. Also spirit and intellect is the best stats while leveling.
---
You think sharding at launch is authentic?
---
While its probably true that blizzard wants to deliver an authentic classic experience, they have showed themselves willing to compromise in the past. If there turns out to be a demand for updated models, there is no reason to assume blizzard wont consider it.
---
basically every vanilla pvp movie in a nutshell :D
---
I do not agree with this. HoTs help smoothen tanks health by healing a small portion of health between big heals. It might cause overheal and might not be the most efficient spell but it clearly has a purpose. The second aspect is swiftmend that allows to instant cast the total value of the hot for 10% of your base mana. So you can basically heal twice a hot spell for 2 global cooldown.
---
It’s as if you were saying that power word: shield is useless... it’s useful for hard hitting bosses or to cast it on dps, to ensure they do not die on a dot.
---
Advantages and disadvantages to priests in pvp and pve?
---
It was all good until the abrupt end lol
---
Depending on your class, you can use 50-60 to grind essential mats for endgame. For example, as a warlock you can start farming felcloth for 2-3 levels. You can start the winterspring frostsaber reputation grind at lvl 58 or farm that timbermaw hold rep for the off hand.
---
If you already know what you need you can utilize on that during those levels.
---
Do you reckon they look silly in gear/felsteed? 
---
That's my main worry with Gnome, they might end up looking silly and I'll regret my choice. 
---
Isn't Mute his warlocks name?
---
Look on specific class guides, they usually talk about this.
---
Absolutely.
---
1. Can enchant gear on your other toons
---
2. Can act as a bank that you can trade with - much more convenient than mail given the 1 item per trade limit
---
3. Can be used to boost toons
---
4. Can be used to assist with farming
---
5. Fantastic if you're  the Guild Bank (see 2.)
---
6. Can act as a resource gather alt so your main can have two production professions.
---
etc etc
---
I'm probably going to get a second account simply as I've got to run/manage a guild bank and it can double as a guild enchanter.
---
That's fine. I didn't say it was impossible, considering Joana is doing it right now.  
---
Even then, you're referencing a speed run that was achieved on a realm that had heavy dynamic respawns.  
---
No proper/realistic speedrun has been done outside of Joana's.  
---
Looks like you wrote it in Latex with the mint package for the coding sections, or is it another package ? Just curious :) 
---
Thank you for providing graphs as well.
---
You will be fine! First, you seem to have the proper mindset as you want to learn about it.
---
You should have a look at skarm video, it’s quite interesting.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ
---
I recommend however that you level in arms or fury, as prot leveling is really harsh (appart if you plan to level with friends 90% of the time, in dungeon or questing).
---
I actually leveled from 1-60 as restoration, it was on an alt and I mainly quested with a friend and spammed dungeons. It was fun and easily doable, but slow as fuck. 
---
Being the ‘correct’ spec while leveling makes content extremely easy, but usually slow as hell for anything but dps, so I’d recommend not doing it since you can easily heal as feral if you collect int gear on the side. 
---
As for resto in general, it’s a fun way of healing, and hots are imo a more engaging way of healing, and not that it really matters but druid healers are obviously the worst when it comes to HPS and efficiency. You also lack a reliable ress which sucks. 
---
I’m rolling human paladin to heal at 60. For 5 mans and raids are people utilizing holy paladins? Also, is tanking as a pally viable in classic if I want to switch it up?
---
haha, had a similar thing with my nephew back then, so I set up a shittier computer with Linux for him to play Runescape while I kept WoWing it up.
---
Sliightly ashamed about it, but then again he still plays it to this day.
---
I would love to see an updated version of the old rewards. I don't think you should bring back former rewards, let people have something special.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I hope this never happens.  
---
That's some good info there, I need to nail down the professions but I'm inexplicably drawn to Engineering.
---
Where is your keyboard??
---
How could it possibly do any harm?
---
What kind of loot system will you guys be using in your raid? I wondered if a mixture of loot council and dkp would be best.. 
---
As a shadow priest I remember in TBC i would change to some greens for raiding, as they had more +shadow damage than my epics had. (Kara and early raids only) 
---
It might only have been one green tbh? I can’t remember properly
---
Question is, are there any greens like that  for vanilla? Ones that sacrifice stats like INT and STA but push your Dps higher? Mainly for shadow priest but I guess any underrated items/gear 
---
Ya frankly I agree now, was quite the purist a year ago. However, gosh let people play the game how they want. You just know people will overwrite the data patch files themselves otherwise. 
---
FYI if you’re unaware just google updated models 1.12 and you can see that you can easily make Prt Server graphics Legion quality. 
---
If it’s not impacting other people’s experience which it doesn’t at all, go for it imo 👍
---
Bald spot and all
---
Probably the best source of money if you know how to play your cards right
---
I remember "lol! Yeah right!"
---
Tipsout 
---
They’ve stated Classic will have multi-item post thankfully 👍
---
hard cast pyro, pom, pyro again. gg
---
My immersion!
---
How?
---
This is why we need to be vocal about Disk Access Throttling. Blizzard has clearly shown that they are willing to listen, and if we are loud enough, they have no choice but to acknowledge our opinions. 
---
Great videos man! Love the book club series!
---
Do I absolutely have to talent for Enrage if I want to be serious at Arms warrior PvP? Because no matter how I look at it, speccing for it seems to gimp you because you either won't have points for tactial mastery or weapon specialization.
---
Razer copperhead? 
---
I’m not a hard no change guy and am open to sharding 1-6, but I’d be pretty upset if it went past level 12.
---
Level 10-12 is where 95% of people are gonna quit playing for the day, on launch day. From there, people have drastically different sleep schedules, play times, rl obligations, etc. The barrens and Redridge are nothing compared to the starter zones, which I agree should be sharded.
---
Empty crossroads and empty westfall would just be awful, and I think it would be much more devastating to start classic off on that foot rather than some people having to wait for mobs 
---
You can tank 5 mans no problem. Prot pallies are dope for small group content. 
---
It just wasnt very known about.
---
I'm like 99% sure as part of their changes thing it was that new graphics would be in but as a option since it is all client based.
---
Kind of like how old addons could make players pirates or ninjas on your screen back before they banned it.
---
Hey guten Morgen, du Loser.
---
Man siehst du heute wieder scheiße aus.
---
&gt;Players find a workaround by abusing server latency
---
Binding /sit to your mouse scroll wheel in your opinion is abuse of the system.  Which is so absurd it hurts my head trying to imagine how you think you're right about this.
---
&gt;By that logic you should be able to wallwalk and do other exploits in Classic because hey, "it wasn't actually fixed".
---
When did you decide I was defending /sit procs?  I never claimed I wanted it to work.  The point is I'm upset it wasn't actually fixed. BuT mUh PaTcHnOteS
---
You also gave a shit example because wallwalking was actually fixed.  They updated the game meshes, I know, because I was there when it happened.  
---
It is a Razer mouse but I’m not sure which. 
---
Do Mouse over macros work in Classic?
---
Ah well that's a relief!
---
Orc, because the troll racial requires you to be at low hp to get the full benefit from it. The orc racial also has a two-minute cooldown, just like Blade Flurry, so it pairs up well. Additionally, the 25% stun resist from Hardiness is great for PvP.
---
Potentially for an outrageous fee.
---
Nostalrius has been the first massive server that drew Retail players unfamiliar with Vanilla to the game. It´s the best comparison we have and is definitely much better than saying "I think it will be like this because it will be like this".
---
Plus, if Nostalrius had much bigger population of Pserver vets than Classic will, it only supports "Mass Exodus" theory. Those vets are more likely to stay, so Classic should have even smaller player retention than Nostalrius.
---
Look at your tier sets and judge if you find it ridiculous.
---
There should be the same system we had originally, which was just a sandbox for children to play in, if there are nono words, then mature filter should take them and players should have the option whether they want or not to read them
---
Plenty. You'll see all serious wand users use uncommon wands of "shadow, frost etc."
---
The recipe was a pretty rare drop in general. Most people don't sell it. But if you were looking to make some money, the Neutral AH would definitely be the place to sell it since you can mark it up pretty high.
---
I would think most likely not, since it seems to not require an upfront purchase. I think WoW classic will only require a subscription, so i suspect there will not be a trial to start(they may add it later). That also means, it is only 15$ to try for a month. 
---
Hunters can farm them quite efficiently. Worth noting is that the sisters have ½ the health of the fel lords, so focus them. Simply nuke them, wing clip, repeat.
---
You could whisper people from lvl 1
---
Hello. I have recently listened to the mute (world of roguecraft) interview on the (great) countdown to classic podcast!
---
Can someone please answer me the following:
---
- on what patch was mute playing the rogues and recording the videos?
---
- will this type of (op) gameplay be possible in classic/1.12 ?
---
- when were rogues nerfed and how (during classic)
---
- what spec did he use?
---
I am sure this has been answered a million times, but I would be thankful if someone is willing to sum it up for me once more!
---
I mean, better chair, for back and posture assistance. And yeah, I'd say growing up with better technology is considered being lucky. I'm not talking about video games, but in general. 
---
Interesting hopefully this is true 
---
the fuck is a pitpockett? 
---
Generally you can figure this out by just looking at your spec. You didn't mention a class so I'll just use Combat Rogue Swords for leveling.  
---
Do I use sinister strike a lot? I sure do, that gets trained to the max (same will go for eviscerate etc)  
---
Do I need kick? Yes for interrupts. Do I need rank 2 kick? It only increases the damage so no, just keep kick rank 1.
---
Do I use backstab or ambush? No, don't need.  
---
If you know how your class levels and what you need to be using then choosing which spells to train shouldn't be an issue.
---
I think at least two months since you can rank up only so fast. Going from 9 to 10 may take a few weeks.
---
Basically the only way to gear twinks reliably
---
The solution to massive gatherings is to let the weak lag and die in the fight.
---
This is warcraft, baby.
---
Dwarf...and what class...?
---
Wait hots never stacked? 
---
I remember specifically when a patch arrived and our MT wanted to be kept up by only hots to test it out. Is this a figment of my imagination?
---
I'd suggest points in prot will provide minimal benefit and possibly make it harder on your group. The early skills in prot are mitigation focused meaning you'll lose threat generation for survivability. It's unlikely that you'll need additional survivability so the reduced threat generation will possibly make it easier for your group members pull off you.
---
Moreover, the prot talents won't help much in PvP but you'll miss the points you lose from fury.
---
It doesn't matter all my dwarven brothers are good tier.
---
&lt;3
---
We are going to classic to for the game.
---
Not the ugly character models
---
That exactly how I wanted it to end.
---
I can second that, haha. I guess both Horde and Allies were just reflecting their anger issues
---
I doubt there will ever be one, especially at launch. Launch will be crowded enough as it is and Blizzard is considering sharding.
---
Well paldins and warlocks have the mount (big deal in classic).
---
Hunters have the pet and the radar, and also the arrows (just like in wotlk).
---
Mage portals and druid forms were also a big deal in classic, changing the way you approach the game much more than today (theres a big difference between having your travel form before the lvl 40 mount). Same goes with warlocks summoning portal. 
---
Priest have unique skills depending on the race.
---
Rougues have the unlocking skill and the poisons. 
---
Its druid stealth worst than Rougues one??? 
---
The modern servers are far more complicated than that. BfA servers might do that, because they're scaled around the fact that the modern game almost never has more than 20 players in any given area. For Classic they will undoubtetly use beefier instances because it's necessary given the circumstances.
---
I think $15 for a month trial is fair after considering Twitch, YouTube, and pservers.  There will be thousands of hours of footage on the first day so you can decide from there.
---
There's downsides to trial accounts that aren't worth it.  People racking up trials for account selling, gold farmers, item muleing, being toxic and racist for fun, targeted harassment of a player, making logos with corpses etc. 
---
Trials can do a lot of damage.
---
How did PvP actually work in vanilla? Not the actual fighting itself, but like where you fight, how you get gear etc? I have literally never pvp'd so i have no idea.  
---
Do you just go to wherever a battleground is in the world, wander into the portal and wait until both sides have 40 and then fight it out until someone wins? And then you get honour for kills as well as for winning? Do you buy gear from vendors with honor? 
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIboxuE0zu0x](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIboxuE0zu0x) This is most cookie cutter pvp build(actually only one) enrage is really good against every class and free %25 damage most of the time
---
Im not OP, but this is something i just threw together https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVbuxzhoZxVMdVMuL
---
You look like a master theorycrafter!! :D
---
It’s all about the he said she said bullshit
---
Night Elf - Rogue
---
&gt; ban all addons other than dps, threath an ui (bartender ect). Figth me
---
If some addons need to be banned, then cooldowns, dps and threat first. They're the ones that affect gameplay the most.
---
He stopped playing wow an eternity ago.
---
This is what I keep telling myself, and yet... I'll see you guys at zero hour.
---
You get honor, but it's not a currency, just a number. That number is then calculated based on how well you rank against other people on the server into a rank. Different ranks will unlock different gear that you can then buy for gold. Also some pvp gear require exalted with some PvP factions.
---
You can queue up for a BG in the towns probably. In earlier versions you had to physically go there.
---
Is this viable to follow for non speedrunners? As in people not rolling hunter/druid etc? 
---
You can queue from NPCs in cities, than you just have to wait for the battleground to start. There are 3 BGs in classic, Warsong is a Capture the Flag 10v10, Arathi is 15vs15 with 5 controll points and then there is the big one, Alterac Valley wich is a 40vs40 with NPCs.
---
When you get honor from kills or winning BGs, you get higher PVP Ranks. With each rank you can buy different gear, items or mounts. 
---
https://vanillaguides.com/2018/05/24/pvp-ranks-in-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-wow-classic/
---
One thing you'll almost certainly be wearing throughout your leveling process as a warrior is the pair of Triprunner Dungarees leather pants. Nothing comes close to them in stats.  
---
So there are definitely cases where you would want to wear leather; if they're good enough. Just do it on a case-by-case basis depending on what you find.
---
In my memory, I ran out of quests at 55. I spent 5 levels in winterspring killing furbolgs and yetis for leather.
---
Oh ok so its like a seeding system and being a certain seed allows gold purchase. Cool. How do you gain rep with PvP factions? Just by grinding BGs?  
---
Is world pvp ever really beneficial outside of the obvious 'its fun' - because i like the look of it
---
Hard to say honestly as Private servers played with the pick pocketing values. However, at an educated safe guess 40g/hour if you’re competent. More with killing the bar guy. 
---
Awesome thanks, i'm probably going to get absolutely pounded but it'll be fun to try out - i'll probably level to 60 first though
---
Yea you just grind BG's.
---
Wpvp can help with the honor grind, but most servers will probably have premades that you have to compete with and you're not gonna out honor them by doing wpvp. You can get the lower ranks with wpvp though. But all the great gear is at the high ranks. The low ranks only have blue gear that is very hit or miss.
---
Ya mate, most Warlocks and mages will have greens of +frost and shadow 👍 good times 
---
technically they changed the pricing of wow so that you only need to buy the current xpac. if you have the subscription you get all the way to legion Included so you don't need to buy the $20 base game anymore.
---
low level enchants usually not worth selling or making since you will replace those items. and you need to be on ironforge or orgrimmar to sell so it will slow down your leveling. but if you are gonna get first recipes in your mc runs with you guild %100 worth at 60. same with aq enchants when its released
---
Thanks for these. Been looking for some music of this ilk but never know where to start with bands/tracks
---
Is The Nicker offensive?
---
What?! I did The exact same, only Troll Shaman! My pvp nightmare was Troll Sham, so i thought „to defeat your enemy you have to become the enemy.“ 
---
Best experience as a healer until cata

PVP. Resist gear.  How much less damage frostbolt/pyro/whatever inflicts on someone with 200-300-400 resist? What is the chance to resist fear etc. when enemy has 300 resist on items?
---
Dude work on your posture :D
---
The fans didn’t get them to do a damn thing. Classic was created SOLELY because the company is entirely out of ideas and is complete utter shit. Frantically grabbing for any possible idea to squeeze some more cash out of any of their titles.
---
The only thing the fans did to help make the decision was maybe pissing blizzard off seeing how popular private servers got from their material. 
---
Of course now they are playing the part acting to “work” with the community when it’s only a pathetic attempt to stay above water with the fan base. 
---
PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT if you think the people/fans changed or won anything with this your delusional corporate will eat your bones for a buck.
---
I want to pick something with a move speed increase like shaman, druid, or hunter. I'll be going horde because that's all I've ever known.  
---
Warriors are cool but they don't have any real cool abilities. Rogues are cool too but don't interest me at all. Warlocks are kind of awesome with all their niche abilities from soul stones and pets. Mages are also awesome and can get around a bit faster with portals. Paladins get the mount at 40 just like warlocks which gives a huge bonus to not have to spend gold that early. Priests are awesome levelers and have nearly 0 downtime in between pulls and they have some get out of death free cards if overwhelmed.
---
I usually just pick whatever race I want or goes better with the class. It doesn't matter as much as people make it out to be. No one is going to tell you no because of a race. They'll tell you no because of a class though. Maybe if you're on the bleeding edge of raiding, but I don't think anyone here is lol. 
---
Esfand tbh is the ‚best‘ of them. He trollls so much People think he‘s trolling even if he‘s clearly not
---
That's is the indicator for 'epic quality youtube content creators'
---
It's all about whether or not it can fill that 10 min clip time - they truly care about the topics they present during that timeframe
---
end of Irony 
---
And you don't want that, you want to strafe right away.
---
Night Elf Rogue as well...!!
---
They look like shit and the mounts are huge and look slow. Played a gnome warlock to 60 in classic and always wished I was human
---
I laughed in vanilla.
---
Old machinima was so bad yet so damn good
---
Troll for sure
---
Two weeks for me. This will be epic :D
---
Is Blood Craze worth it? I checked different calculators and one says it's 12% hp maxed the other says 3%... Which is the real lol.
---
The Haunted's self titled album and "Shithead" in particular and Vaelestrasz. Also time of Warcraft Movies songs but I don't listen to those songs as often.
---
While leveling you will likely be asked to tank.  And quite frankly outside of actual pre raid BiS items while create friction with potential group mates.  
---
Just quit it months before release and find new one after you lvl up to 60. Ez
---
Oxhorn never gets old
---
I’m gonna say it’s a pretty safe bet there will be some sort of promotional thing, either an open beta or a free weekend some time after release. 
---
What trolling he's just seems like a boring neckbeard to me that makes fun of people going super hardcore need while he does it himself
---
There is is
---
Side note: are these usually random drops (think this is the case) or quest items? Would be nice to have a list of the best +shadow/+frost damage from easily obtained gear. (If somebody who isn’t me wants to do that?)
---
Also 
---
Spell damage trinkets? 
---
Used to have 2 with separate cooldowns for TBC, I think they will share cool downs on classic if I remember correctly? Are there any exceptions to this rule, or are they any other trinkets that are vastly superior? 
---
For pvp I will have the pvp trinket and a spare slot, is it worth having a spell power trinket or is the damage increase lacklustre in pvp compared to other possible trinkets? Cannonball runner was super fun! 
---
 I’m not starting a new thread about shadow priests 😅
---
So this how guy who fucks my mom on the internet looks like.
---
I’ll have you know that paladins were statistically the most played at one point in vanilla so ha! 
---
I was an undead rogue :/ 
---
If I had money I'd reddit gold you - 90% of the people who were talking shit about Blizzcon demo never even stepped foot in retail vanilla. 
---
You probably still had a better experience than we did on launch day...
---
It is a skill where you carry around an avocado seed in your pocket, and use it to distract enemies so you steal stuff from them. Rouges only unfortunately 
---
Once the servers are up and running (how ever many that maybe) , do you think you will be able to see live demographics for your particular server?
---
At some point I'd look to create an alt and I think it wound help my decision to choose based on the live number of each class.
---
For instance, if my server had a low numbet of druids for the alliance, I'd maybe role one as an alt.
---
Do you think this live info will be available?
---
&gt;For instance, limit the CastSpell and UseItem to be usable only during code initiated by keypress.
---
That's how it already works in the old API btw. Smart buttons is cancer for pvp. In original vanilla, 99% of people just didn't know how to abuse it.
---
Why the fuck not?
---
You could literally *never* see that functionality if you wanted to avoid it. It does not effect your experience *at all*.
---
This meme is really funny, i dont know why but it just is. Might be cus he either got worlds best pokerface or he really thinks it was 3000 years ago. 😂
---
I had maxed out everything on my character.
---
The only thing I might not max out this time is First Aid, since I have a healer this time. But I probably do it, because of my OCD in gaming.
---
Fishing is great after a stressful day at work and fishing/cooking just go well together. I also want to be able to get the Zul'Gurub boss for my Guild.
---
Also pretty funny if you get some Off-Hand Fish trophies. My Guild-Officer and I would have a competition who got the biggest trophy.
---
Also a great way to help out your Tanks with the Stonescale Eels. And of course you can get Essences in big Water Pools in Azshara, which is always nice. 
---
And last but not least, the best cooking recipe in vanilla: Savory Deviate Delight, I need this recipe so bad.
---
Fishing is a great thing in Classic. I love it.
---
ahh if theres ONE thing I dont want to experience again its ..
---
Doable but difficult. AOE threat is good but single target threat is low. You also lack a taunt and run out of mana pretty quickly.
---
No usually these stories of bans are bullshit and the banned person has a history of bans and isn't telling the entire story.
---
On the way up to 60, I wouldn't spend too much time in prot spec. Dungeons aren't good for leveling and you'll want to spec arms or fury for 1 to 60. You can always take 5 or so points in prot if you really want to but it's not at all necessary.
---
At level 60 switch to prot and start tanking. It's not as hard as people make it out to be. Just read up on the fights and watch them on YouTube before you go into them. You'll be fine. 
---
Have fun trying to convince 4 clothies to fight over gear while you keep all the leather and mail to yourself.
---
I doubt it, I would have given much and more to be able to cast just one Fireball on a wolf in Northshire that day.
---
Well there's no way they would use raw numbers just because of how easy it would be to quantify total players, which blizzard is pretty against at this point. Using percentage of total players would be nice but I doubt they do that as well. 
---
Game won't be the same if I don't get stuck in Zeppelin loading screens
---
Based on my experience as a mage, I used to be very circumspect about using Evocation. Lately i found out it's really worth picking it up ASAP and use it almost on CD while leveling. It will speed your leveling process quite a lot.
---
Always shield never renew. 
---
&gt;PVE they're good, it's just that paladin, priests, and shamans are all better.
---
Then what makes them good, exactly? If they're the worst healer?
---
By the way what was wrong with Elwynn forest I always thought it was pretty cool - although there were glitching taxi mounts all over the place
---
I mean, it's against the rules to let someone else log into your account, but if you're talking about paying people RL money for dungeon runs then yeah i guess but i doubt it'll "plague" Classic. You'd have to pay me a lot of money to run someone through dungeons all day every day for days
---
TIL you can multibox 5 characters on two accounts.
---
hehe funny comment, in reality i mainly played undead rogue and my "alt" was a orc warrior!
---
//vector
---
I was waiting for this moment everyday for about 3 months!
---
Given that ranking is dependent on the amount of people playing PvP I'd say it's pretty much impossible for ANYONE to tell you how long things may take.
---
something like that yes hehe!
---
Dont know
---
but i guess yes.
---
It was the case for all of vanilla, that’s why hunters had feign death trap macros
---
You guys know this is photoshopped right? I mean how is a dog supposed to sit like that
---
thanks sir!
---
 Patch 2.0.1 (05-Dec-2006): Traps can be set while in combat, but require a 2 second arming time.
---
didn't it let you to /script CastSpell() on /in beforee 2.0.1?
---
I don't know, maybe it's a higher up decision. + It's probably more simple to just include it for free rather than making it a separate payment 
---
You can level tailoring to get stuff to DE to get mats for lesser wand. Then drop tailoring for whatever you want.
---
Well thank you, sir. I was doubting myself
---
Impossible to say yet. A trial account for classic would be horrible though, you cant speak to anyone (except /say), join guilds, trade etc. For bfa this is standard behaviour but not for classic.
---
You're right
---
$15/month also isn't worth as much as it was in 2004.
---
$15 today is worth about $10-$11 in 2004 money, so they're basically charging $5 less per month, which is reasonable. Sure, they aren't adding any new content, but they still gotta keep the lights on and pay all their GMs and all of the people porting it over to the retail client and probably even more that we don't even know. Plus, of course, they want to make a profit. I think paying the equivalent of 2/3rds of the monthly sub that I paid in 2004 is perfectly reasonable.
---
Nope never played that early on. But I do have the alpha build on my computer, it was interesting seeing certain areas before they changed it to what it is today.
---
Hi, /u/KozedyrKare
---
The post you're looking for is above this one
---
what do you mean on /in?
---
Yes you could use CastSpellByName() in scripts as those are initiated by a keypress. Using CastSpellByName() inside a combat log event for  example is whats not possible. Same with targetting functions.
---
No.
---
Oh god such an amazing point. There is absolutely no tech in the world that they can use to have 2 players who want to play together to see each other even through sharding. Oh wait there is. Just group up in a party and there you go.
---
Thanks a lot for your feedback! While I haven‘t experienced it myself, I already heard about gold being an issue for warriors, hence I was thinking about a second character on a different account to level alongside my warrior. 
---
Yeah, one that I know of was thunderclap I think, which pretty much is a bread-and-butter ability for AoE-tanking in Wrath. I guess you have to make use of tab target switching + sunder and shouting to hold aggro of packs in vanilla for the most part, right?
---
Compared to vanilla, most of the DPS classes in Wrath were a bit more complex than playing a tank, so tanks would naturally make the calls instead of damage dealers or healers. I‘m happy to hear that a tank in Classic doesn‘t have to be the raid leader so he can focus more on what he should do and not what every single player in the raid is doing. 
---
Thank you a lot, you just made me even more motivated to become a successful tank!
---
Thanks for your feedback! I‘ll be sure to check the video out. As for leveling, I was planning on leveling as DPS anyway because I heard prot was even slower than arms or fury and tanking dungeons seems to be possible without a pure tanking spec. 
---
No. Although if the only condition is to "survive the fall", a mage can negate fall damage with Blink or Ice Block as well, so surviving the drop from Tanaris into Un'goro is pretty trivial.
---
Its %3 at max level. Yes very worth it in pvp. You want enrage so have to put some point to go down in fury. Its only getting better with more gear/more hp. Between increased demo shout and increased battle shout, blood craze best for pvp
---
Yeah don't play on there too much. Just friendly advice.
---
Thanks for your response, I guess I should have worded my title a bit more clear since I don‘t intend to level as prot.
---
Why not? Just because you wouldn't use it? Toggle it off and you wont even notice it. 
---
Warriors will almost never need leather gear throughout leveling. Quest rewards, mob drops and dungeons will supply you with plenty of mail/plate.
---
I don't want anyone who doesn't play to see it in screenshots, videos, streams. Nothing.  
---
I don't want anyone to see Classic and draw any similarity to the trash that is retail. Additionally, I don't want those Disney characters to be associated with WoW. If I ever have a conversation about the game with someone who doesn't play, they'll say "is that the game with the Disney characters that you play?"  
---
The new models and animations are horrible. They look like kids running around in suits. Retail might be partially bearable if it wasn't for these horrible modeling decisions.  
---
Meandro and Perkulator were better rogues.
---
And that Tauren lady walking throughout STV was the plains running trainer
---
I can't answer all of these completely, but:
---
&gt; on what patch was mute playing the rogues and recording the videos?
---
I believe the 3 most popular WoR videos spread across patches, but were earlier in the vanilla cycle
---
&gt; will this type of (op) gameplay be possible in classic/1.12 ?
---
Not completely. Rogues are still very powerful in Classic but diminishing returns affected stunlock potential. 
---
&gt; when were rogues nerfed and how (during classic)
---
Eviscerate scaling never changed to my knowledge, which is what made the high damage possible even with no gear equipped. The most significant change were the implementation of Diminishing Returns. 
---
&gt; what spec did he use?
---
Pretty sure he went into assassination to get cold blood, then put the rest into subtlety. Don't have an exact build though.
---
I honestly didn't know this. Thanks
---
I logged in all my old chars during the free weekend 2 weeks ago to see what blizzard has done to them and tried to hide the helmet and cloak, but it seems this is no longer an option.
---
oh I thought it was when you go up to someone and convince them that their pocket is their enemy 
---
I have played Vanilla private servers for 4 years and NOTHING can ruin the fresh hype!
---
Aww yeah, let’s fill these piss jugs boys
---
Same with Hero classes, there was a LOT of hype surrounding them.
---
They were even referenced in the manual
---
Whys that, just because it gives you false impressions of classic or another reason?
---
Wife just booked the family a week at Disney w/c 15th July so that's as good as confirmed.
---
Depends on a lot of factors. First off, Night elves got a stealth improvement racial, rogues got 7 potential talents to slot into improving stealth (although they are rarely maxed out, maybe you grab one or two for pvp), also you got some items that can improve stealth detections (heads mostly iirc).  
---
But as a general rule, you will see a stealthed druid before you see the Rogue, atleast if he is PvP built.
---
&gt; I guess you have to make use of tab target switching + sunder and shouting to hold aggro of packs in vanilla for the most part, right?
---
Yes. I would absolutely suggest taking engineering 100% to help with this. You will be a far better warrior with it in every capacity you play.  
---
&gt; I‘m happy to hear that a tank in Classic doesn‘t have to be the raid leader so he can focus more on what he should do and not what every single player in the raid is doing.  
---
I would not count on this. Many guilds use tanks as their raid leader. I just personally disagree with the practice on a functional level. At the end of the day, the best raid leader is the guy who is the best at leading raids, regardless of their role in the group.  
---
Read the reply I made above.  
---
Also I think vanilla looked great. I'm not the first to say that either.  
---
I see, thanks!
---
How long will it probably take to get into dungeons as a DPS at the launch?
---
That's the only thing I'm really worried about rolling a lock
---
We have listened to the panel. The thing is, the wording used is intentionally left vague.
---
They never stated which zones specifically (they said early zones IIRC, not even starting zones, so it could also extend to Barrens/Westfall/Darkshore/Silverpine, for example). They never said specifically how long (all they said was time limited). They never said they wouldn't use it again at a later date (all they said was they would use it in a limited way).
---
This is EXACTLY me back in vanilla getting boosted/helped with the Whirlwind Weapon quest that you did as a warrior! Stayed up waay to long looking at the cool ass axe. 
---
Thanks Booshea!
---
I listened to a lot of Gorillaz and Placebo while questing in Stranglethorn!
---
Doing the opposite actually, played on them for years now done with them to refresh myself for classic.
---
Duskwood still has its old 2001-2002 building models
---
Yes the experience will not be legitimate unless you take a boat and by the time the loading screen finishes you are back at your starting location.
---
He's worried about getting burnt out of the game.
---
I've had many opportunities to play games that weren't available yet, and I never took them (including beta invites)  
---
I never understood doing things like that. You download a file and it gives you only a tiny bit of the actual surprise.  
---
I'd rather experience the entire package all at once.  
---
I'm glad the game I experienced back then was the entire package all at once (*wink*) instead of partially spoiling it.  
---
I hope you find what help you need, and get that one hug.
---
I did but now taking a break until the real deal, so I can build up the hype... its hard tho..
---
Because Blizzard has over a decade of bad faith and haven't explicitly said they won't use it past launch. That's why we don't trust Blizzard to not use sharding again.
---
I'm not entirely sure which logic Dampen Magic operated on in 1.12. The curious thing about Dampen Magic is that prior to a certain patch it scaled based on raw values, where as at a later point it started following some weird limitations in how much damage it could mitigate.
---
For example, I vividly remember farming those lightning elements in north-west Silithus (I think they may use a dust devil model, but they did lightning damage). The thing was, they didn't hit hard, and all they did was magic damage. The result was that you could cast Dampen Magic on yourself and take almost 0 damage. You could easily AoE farm them despite them even having a Hurricane channel and not exactly wanting to cooperate with kiting, just because you could simply stand still, tank them and Arcane Explosion them down with no risk at all.
---
So basically, assuming that 1.12 still follows that logic, it may be worthwhile on a fights where the tank is constantly being hit by low amounts of magic damage. The average amount of magic damage that the tank takes basically needs to be less than half of the average heal amount, and enough total amount that the physical damage doesn't outweigh the magic damage.
---
I don't think there is any fight where this is actually the case however, although I may be wrong on that.
---
I played on Pvt server The big N  and loved it. It had been a decade. Once shut down I stopped but was thinking of starting up on another pvt server the N D one but didn’t because of Classic announcement. I’m rolling the opposite being horde this time and am starved, rabbid and absolutely salivating for Classic now haha 👍
---
Orc. Troll racial looks better, but you have to be at reduced hp for it to actually be worth it.
---
God. This tired insult again.  
---
For once I just wish someone would say something really fucked up. Something that really makes me step back and feel embarrassment or shame. Like really fuck me up, you know? That's some shit I could have respect for and really make me feel people aren't completely brain dead.  
---
I'm on the opposite side.  I wasn't actually aware of wow classic until early this month, when I was trying to get back into MMOs.  I'm currently giving SWTOR another shot, but after roughly 1.5 months, I'm already bored.  I'm tempted to pick up retail wow to explore what happened between WotLK and now, but I think I'll try another game until classic launches.
---
Oh yeah good point. Didn’t read throughly haha
---
I agree with you. Recently leveled a paladin for first time on vanilla-ish server. Am at like level 22 rn and the grind is getting more serious. Don’t want to burn myself out either. 
---
I was legit uncertain if this was troll or not, which makes this troll even better. Sarcasm done right /clap
---
So like most of us, just more attractive... 
---
The troll priest spell, it can. This is one of the reasons people say troll shadow priest is busted. 
---
Rogue cheap shot, hex has 3 charges and the rogue hits you procing hex and hopefully one of those 3 stuns them 👍
---
FYI if this works in Classic, no one know but we’ll find out soon! 
---
It doesn't cause shadow damage directly, so no.
---
Go play a fresh pserver then. Thats what you are looking for. Never in Vanillas history did it involve 800 people in Northshire. You are confusing what was Vanilla with what your Vanilla pserver experience was like.
---
This is why I'm glad I only work 3 scheduled days (without picking up any additional shifts).
---
The odds that I will be off are better than not! 
---
..and if I'm not then I'll just have to have one of my kind co-workers swap with me.
---
Launch is going to have the biggest population of people leveling/doing dungeons than probably any other point in classic's history. There will also be a ton of warriors out there, many looking to learn vanilla's tanking mechanics, and most of them probably won't give up and reroll until around lvl 30ish. 
---
What about third party sites like realmpop.com? 
---
I never knew how accurate they were, but it would be cool to at least see the faction balances if possible. 
---
It’s a random roll up to +30 at max level on most pieces. 
---
Sadly yes on use trinkets share a 30 sec CD bit on hit do not. 
---
Scarlet Leggings says hello.
---
Alright. This seems alright, but I feel like you're not getting potential out of the elemental tree without the 1 second casting time reduction to CL and LB. 
---
Highly doubt dynamic spawns was much of an impact considering he was way ahead of the pack most of the time.
---
&gt; I mained a mage and I really began to despise the huge number of people begging for food since they never learned to cook
---
That shouldn't be something that bothers you or any other mage. Cooked food requires materials and especially on later levels it should be used for the buffs.
---
In a group, for example for a Dungeon, you should always provide water and food for everyone. It doesn't cost you much time to make it at the start, but it increases the efficiency of the group, because it is much lighter on the healer, when everyone is drinking and eating between every other pull. Basically you decrease the waiting time for everyone, because your healer won't have to drink nearly as much himself.
---
A County band
---
In the beginning didn’t you have to go to your factions Battleground base to queue? Or am I misremembering. Like Ally have to go to Ashenvale to Queue WSG
---
Don't check out retail. I stopped playing after ulduar in wotlk the crusade raid just ruined the experience. I have had the wow bug now every exp and gotten bored after reaching max lvl. Ive been disapointed every time. Me and alot of friends are now hypeing to play together in classic as we did eons ago. 
---
Does the priest talent "blessed recovery" work in shadow form?
---
Holy spells cannot be cast, but it is a passive holy talent. Does anyone have any insight on this?
---
I don't think there's any database that allows searching for such niche stats. I could do something if I had all item texts, but I'm not aware of such a resource. Most of the +shadow or +frost items are just "of Frozen Wrath" or "of Shadow Wrath" though.
---
As for trinkets, damage-increasing trinkets share cooldowns in 1.12. PvP trinkets also have a 5 minute cooldown, which makes it optimal to just swap trinkets constantly. And there's tons of incredibly useful trinkets, even outside of raids. There's [various video's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apeiIc3Nd0w) that discuss [a ton of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBrTw7NaUs).
---
Aye if they had focused more on player involvement and community growth and less on catering to the more casual market (which I do under$tand why they did) then the game would have much better longevity to me. With any luck they’ll treat classic as the more involved version of Warcraft and never add the deathblows like LFG
---
Couple of questions from a noob: 
---
1). What's the best repertory website for 1.12 Addons? I really need a auto attack bar addon and  the one that puts the location of all quest with a exclamation simbol on your map. What addons are you going to use?
---
2). What are your "WoW Blog" websites? Back in Cata I used to read a lot of these comunnity blog websites that had articles about hidden stuff in the game, or bizarre stories like the Gnome March or the Hakkar incident. I would LOVE to read this kind of stuff while playing classic. Podcast works too.
---
3). Can I tank lv 50+ dungeons as a paladin?
---
Your personality sounds exactly as the old WoW models.
---
I am only getting the time off because I am like 70% certain I'll get sacked otherwise for missing work.
---
Been refreshing my memory of the starting zones and getting a feel for what class I want to play.  I dont what to clown fiesta around trying to find shit.
---
Also, I found out that Mulgore is a huge empty shit show and Durotar gives me a headache.  
---
A friend of mine downloaded that. Was so thrilled seeing the world for the first time even though it was an empty shell of the real deal.
---
I think it's wording. You do wear them from level 29-38,  maybe slightly longer if drops are not in your favor and you can't get your hand on scarlet, so the next one will be plate to replace them.
---
The kickbot that I know of relies on a lot more than just CastSpellByName() and there has been kickbots around even after Blizzard disabled CastSpellByName(). In order for a kickbot to work it should be able to detect if a spell is being cast, and a smart kickbot should be able to detect what is being cast.
---
&gt; Well, sort of. They'd just require an extra button press to work in combat.
---
I haven't played retail for a long while now, but I don't remember addons being able to equip items for you or detect item cooldowns and stuff like that. Correct me if i'm wrong :P
---
&gt;  The api is an exception as they had to use the modern client
---
Sure, but that doesn't prevent them from re-enabling (some of) the old API's, does it? Blizzard said that they are aiming for class balance and pvp/pve experience to be the same as it was back then, and I personally think that macros and addons play a big role in that.
---
Superior?  
---
I disagree. My personality is shit. It's not like the old models at all.  
---
I get called names on the internet sometimes and I'm with you on this. The act of name calling and cringe/yikesposting is, in and of itself, complete surrender of the point; an admission that the person has no ideas with which to contend and so they must attack with tired ad-hominems. It is enthusiastic advertisement of the limited intellectual state of the name-caller. Thus it does not serve to hurt me in the intended fashion but, paradoxically, it actually *does* hurt in a way: I always find myself somewhat sad and disquieted at the state of the education system that is crafting such limited people who lack the ability to express themselves in an intellectually forceful manner. 
---
As you say, it would be interesting to have somebody hit back with a rejoinder that really cuts into something that is true. 
---
none of the old addons will work as far as I know, they were written for the 1.12 client (and earlier) and Wow Classic will be running on the modern client.
---
Healers shouldn't be too brutal to find. Tanks *will* be very difficult to locate though. Tanking in vanilla is a lot more challenging. Majority of warriors/druids will find it too intimidating, and a majority of those who don't will immediately become frustrated with DPS making their life much harder.
---
So, likely it will be difficult.
---
Well I'm glad I'm not a nostalgia junkie who's entire Classic experience rests on character models and other visual fluff.
---
Assuming both players are level 60, 150 resist equals a 33% damage reduction, and 300 resist equals a 50% damage reduction on average. The reduction isn't consistent however, as resists can be either 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% resists. There's also a number of spells which are known as "binary spells". Frost spells from mages are binary, for one. What this means is that they only have 100% resist, or 0%. As such, against a frost mage you simply have a 50% chance to resist if you have 300 resistance.
---
Omg lollocaust. That's amazing
---
Yeah that was my understanding as well from the very little I know of him.
---
The mount bit would make sense - that's how I afforded my epic mount in Vanilla...except since they are releasing in 1.12, I believe the whole "riding skill" system is in place (in which the mount is cheap but the skill is expensive).
---
Without the mount discount, without the random BG queues that come in later xpacs, there is no reason for AV haters to play AV.
---
It was debated back in the day too. The majority of hunters I knew that went survival did it because 0/21/30 was the superior PvP spec and they justified it to their raid lead by telling them the personal increase in dps was worth losing TSA. 
---
It would still be their choise. And the new models are a bit too cartoony for my taste, but they made the game age very well, and are miles ahead from the old things. They just take some getting used to.  
---
Vanilla looked *okay* for it's time. Just that. Even then it didn't look great. Blizz knew that, we knew that. Everything was relativated for gameplay. 
---
Jesus fuck man. This sounded like the beginning of a sociology thesis. I don't think I even understood it. You used words like "rejoinder", and quite honestly that is way beyond my social class.  
---
Kind of irrelevant imo since casting shadow word pain doesn't do any damage on the initial cast, but can proceed blackout immediately
---
Not related to the game itself, but would you recommend me reading the WoW Chronicle book series? I thought it'd be nice to kill some time until classic releases, but I'm concerned that the books have too many retcons or stuff from later expansions. I really want to focus on the classic lore. Should I read the older books, like the Warcraft ones, instead?
---
This
---
I'll never get used to the way the new models bounce around like children.  
---
Hard no.  
---
I suggest Outward. 
---
he said fucking cunt
---
It's kind of funny to see old PvP videos like this again. It shows how much people improved at PvP in general.
---
I just rolled on the fresh yesterday on launch to test my duo leveling route. Only a handful of people were ahead about 5 hours in, and those guys were getting help via mob tagging and stuff. Good enough for me, come launch.
---
There are times when you want to use hots and times you dont want to. A good druids knows when.
---
Hey hey, A/S/L? 
---
Hmm, I recall doing /in 2 /cast Moonfire, and it worked. And after some patch it started to moan that it's tainted or something.
---
Hmm... maybe blizzard code (SLASH_CAST) launched by OnUpdate event wasn'T considered "tainted" back then?
---
tq;du: I agree. 
---
For alliance it’s extremely frustrating to play against will of the forsaken rogues who can ignore your fear. Better hope you have great friends who will protect you. 
---
Having said that priests are my favorite class ever. But i will roll Paladin this go around because they are the better healer in PVP. 
---
&gt;Then what makes them good, exactly? If they're the worst healer?
---
Because they are not the worst healer. They just play different from the rest. They are only "bad" because people insist on using healing meters as some ultimate measurement of performance. Having the ability to hot up every melee on encounters with steady incoming aoe damage (there's quite a few of these) can be invaluable, and smooth out the incoming damage to allow other healers to land their heals.
---
Omg dude, acronyms are my trigger so I'd appreciate if you refrain or else I may have an attack.  
---
What’s the name of the gnome fruit vendor in ironforge?
---
Damn old man Time straight up robbed that lion’s mane Reck had back in the glory days.
---
I’m a little worried that the overflow from 1-10 zones will be so strong that we have to shard 10-20 and maybe even later zones.
---
I’d hate to see Classic’s entire low level experience be like the demo.
---
I think the biggest most telling question at the moment, is what kind of server stability were working with. Obviously it’s 2019 and technology has come a long way, but in a capacity sense, the servers could be weaker than they were in 2004. They have updated their server technology to work in modern WoW, where there are multiple shards of every area. 
---
I’m sure they’ve thought of this, but it’s one of the few things that I’m a little uneasy towards, at the moment.
---
No one is refusing op to do it. It's about whether it's a realistic goal or not. If he's lucky enough to find peoole willing to go along with it, it'll be an uphill battle. Refusing to acknowledge this is what has people calling OP out, not the decision itself
---
No it’s not. Blizzard themselves said it’s for server performance. 
---
&gt; Mail anything worth selling on the AH to your bank alt.
---
This by the way includeds many, many items. Usually if something isn't "grey" one should always check what they are for, and possibly check the AH prices for it.
---
&gt; Don't spend gold on spells unless you need them.
---
This advice can be ignored entirely. Players who are otherwise using their gold well can buy all of their skills.
---
&gt; Don't buy anything from the AH except for your starting wand and quest items.
---
Most important advice IMO. Many players are wasting precious gold to upgrade their leveling items.

What are Disney characters?

Time enjoyed is not time wasted, especially when you don't lose progress by playing other factions/characters. Start out as Night Elf, and play until it's no longer fun. Play as Orc until it's no longer fun. Just have fun!
---
Somehow the persons character name is always conveniently left out of these these posts.
---
Loot council. Mix could work. Depends on ages of the raid and how much the people care about gear vs progression. 
---
It took you 2 years to get to level 18?
---
liking your character is much more important, imo. As for zones its not like you completely unable to access them as alliance. you still can come there and experience the atmopshere and stuff, or raid cities :).
---
also female orcs are upright, pretty cool model. with a helmet they pretty much lookk like normal humanoid character.
---
Hm, Funny how tastes are different 
---
I’ve been changing my mind several times but I have settled on Paladin and my friend is going warrior. In vanilla I was the warrior and my friend was the paladin. It’s time to pay back the pocket heals and allow the class fantasy to take over. 
---
Wording is all you have when reading a comment though :p
---
... and then wow again in summer! 
---
I really hope this doesn't happen too, the new models will look really bad with the older armor/items that are available.
---
I hope things remain as the same as a lot of the classic servers will be a blast of the past. Lots of nostalgia will be a driving force for many, changing the models and update the spell effects will take it away.
---
You'd be surprised how many of these "I was suddenly/wrongly banned" posts leave out the entire story.
---
Awaiting JMod smackdown. 
---
Lumbar support you mean
---
I was first a gnome mage, then rerolled gnome warrior as my computer managed around 10fps and I thought the better armour of a warrior was more forgiving than cloth. 
---
Hell yeah, thanks for the tips. 
---
IF it uses the legion engine.... I am sure someone will be able to easily mod in new models.
---
it doesn't matter because if you get reported by many players in same time it works automatically. Me and my friends were muted in game many times when selling dungeon boosts for gold by competition or salty players that don't want to pay but want to get boosted. 
---
I wouldn't wear Scarlet Leggings over Triprunner, but maybe that's just me. I prefer the increased crit and overall \*more\* stats.
---
Rolling a mage and had a couple questions. Does dampen magic/spell resistance apply to ice barrier/mana shield? Also, if I have ice barrier and frost ward up and get hit with a frost bolt, will it hit the ward or the shield first?
---
Pretty sure even the old models "bounce around".
---
Unless you aren't wearing a bra. :V
---
That beast monitor LOL. Takes up 1/3 the frame but still gets cut off frame.
---
Had one around 30" just like it, it weighed so much that it permanently arched my comp table towards the center. Still using that table now, the arch is a reminder of the good old days.
---
I'm sure something like that would exist but it's probably based on variables that aren't the most accurate, just to give a range of players. 
---

In my experience these professions are best for money making that fit a cloth wearer well:
---
**Herbalism + Fishing + Alchemy**
---
Very good money maker if done right, especially since everyone and his mother is learning engineering + mining or skinning + mining.
---
To make the best use of this combo it is advised to research/explore when and where certain fish/herbs are spawning. Reguarly check AH prices for fish oils, herbs, consumables etc. and focus your farming on the ones that do well.
---
**Skinning + Tailoring**
---
Solid money maker, convienient and consistent. You can sell gear, skins and most importantly bags on the AH. It is a nice, low effort combo.
---
**Enchanting + Tailoring**
---
The investment here is significantly larger than with the other combos, but enchanters can demand good tips if they have the right recipees. Also instead of vendoring gear (soulbound/worthless on AH) you can disenchant it to get precious materials. Might be a slightly better money maker than the first combo but also requires more investment.
---
I think nobody really, not even the OP thought of wearing Dungarees to 60 though as warrior. :D Nobody can be this noobish - hopefully.
---
Was that for 1.12.1? When I tested it earlier on a certain undocumented server it did not work in OnUpdate or OnEvent scripts.
---
I doubt finding a tank will be any different that what it is on retail. If anyone is new to classic, it can take a few encouraging words from other members to tell them they'll be fine. There will obviously be no fast-paced pulls, at most they'll be tanking 2 mobs at once and when they get the hang of LoS pulls, any warrior/paladin/druid will use that as an advantage to get into groups.
---
This is the "normal" type of macro that I spoke about. The thing about this macro is that if you have it on button number 1 in battle stance for example, and you have intercept on button number 1 in berserker stance, what will happen if you press this button twice or more too quick, is that you will charge and then instantly intercept your target. This happens A LOT - if you are against another warrior you want charge him before he charges you, and if you see a mage casting polymorph on you in the distance, you want to try to interrupt that with your charge. In reality you are not going to casually click your charge button once, no you are going to smash that button 900 times to make sure that your charges goes off the second you are in range of your target. Eventually this causes you to click one too many times and then we have the problem.
---
In todays wow, warriors got that talent "Double Time" which adds an extra charge to your Charge ability. Luckily Blizzard made it so there is a tiny cooldown between those charges so that players wont accidentally charge twice in one charge.
---
I can only hope that Blizzard will replicate that for charge and intercept in classic wow, if they don't enable the old api.
---
I think I tanked Scarlet Monastery with a whirlwind axe. Hah 
---
Yep, gorgeous girl playing wow. All you need in life. 
---
If you wanted to purchase the items then yea you could queue from Ashenvale but you could queue up from any major city. 
---
/u/HawkBog
---
I'm gonna go ahead and just disagree with this. Defiance is the single biggest threat improving talent you can get in Vanilla. Due to it multiplying your 1.3x Defensive Stance threat by 1.15, you get an even better improvement than you may suspect. You can get 5/5 with Cruelty 5/5 and it'll make your life in dungeons way easier. Plus, having improved Bloodrage and Anger Managment means you can pool rage and start fights with full rage. 
---
Check out [this build] (https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSMzefQNATADzkAw). In my opinion, Last Stand and 1/3 Improved Shield Block aren't needed for 5 mans. So, you might as well go 5/5 defiance, which you can get with only 15 points in prot. You still get all your PvP goodies. And Cruelty just synergises too well with impale to skip it. 
---
Ok, one cannot talk about illegal danish without talking about the precursor, Zinwrath.

Wont sharding only be in the starting zones? So people dont have to fight over the starting zone quest mobs ect? So people can actualy play?
---
I am holding off till classic and it hurts so much.
---
I hope after 14 years, they have smart enough designers to automatically:    
---
     
---
1 consider IP source: If you get reported by a multiboxer, It will most likely all come from the same IP.   This should just set a flag for manual inspection.            
---
        
---
2 look at guild tag/party:  If you get reported by multiple people from the same guild/party, it ought to set a flag for investigation rather than auto ban.  At least, limit the number of reports accepted from a guild towards a single person in a set time frame.       
---
       
---
3. for bonus points, the system ought to save the last 100ish lines of text and all whispers from the last hour for all participants.         
---
         
---
Hand out solid bans for people that abuse it, and let this be known.   The system will regulate itself largely after the first couple guild wide week long suspensions are handed out.
---
Good point. I guess I knew silence can’t so this makes sense to some degree 
---
I read alot about Paladin tanking the last days, so I hope I can give some insight.
---
I think the general consensus is that the Paladin is a good dungeon tank but not so much in raids. He has a lot of problems when it comes to raid bosses, like not having a taunt, not getting enough defense rating and things like defense and parry actually working against his own kit. But all that doesn't affect him too much in dungeons. As long as you have some key talents (Righteous Fury, Consecration, Redoubt/Shield Spec) and fitting gear, you should be able to tank any dungeon as long as you're reasonably geared.
---
I tried it myself with a 31/20/0 talents, because I wanted to see if a full holy pally would be able to tank dungeons, and it worked just fine. If you have an impacient dps, you can buff him Salvation instead of whatever you gave him before and that'll help alot. If you lose aggro you can divine favor + holy shock for burst threat. Mana isn't an issue as long as you use JoW and know when to use SoW. Also, you can have a macro that BoPs your target of target, so you can smash that in an emergency and hope you're the second on the list. Now that sounds like a lot of hassle but it really isn't, usually stuff sticks to you because of JoR, ret aura and consecration, and if it doesn't, gear with more spellpower will help alot, since your threat mostly comes from your Holy damage.
---
Also, there are some controversial opinions on Paladins tanking, but I think it's mostly regarding raids. Check out [this guide/discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a2iq9n/a_discussion_on_protection_paladins/). I think it's the most unbiased one I've seen. He's talking really critically about what's wrong with Tankadins but he's also talking about what they're good at.
---
Wasn't that around when the core 2 duos came out? I had one of those and it was actually super decent.
---
I keep trying to install it on my MacBook but am having no luck getting it working. Otherwise I’d give it a shot.
---
Human. I tried a Gnome once and ended up quitting the character around level 35-40 because they just feel so stupid. Other people also didn't take me seriously as a result. But maybe that was just my personal experience. 
---
Absolutely. You just gotta cast slow fall when you're close to the ground.
---
You say that but I've come across too many retards on private servers. The amount of hunters that instantly multi-shot and mages that hop around with arcane explosion are staggering. I swear there is an inbreeding problem on these servers. Their brains just aren't functional at all...
---
Imagine, despising players for expecting you to use your kit. Whats next, crying about sheeps?
---
For the *demo*, yes, that was the primary purpose of using sharding. However, Ion explicitly said during Blizzcon that they were considering sharding for the release because there would be tourists and they would affect server pop. He did also mention that it would help with the server load in the early zones (but they don't need even sharding to do that since they could just use whatever they methods they used before by dynamically adjusting server queues and increasing server pop over time, and/or release more servers).

Just please tell me you have a taller desk now.
---
I feel exactly the same way, so you're not alone in this. 
---
Same, but to around 40. Ended up re-rolling as a human because the race seems to stupid it ruined the games immersion to me. Each to their own though.
---
I’ve read the first one, have the second and plan on reading it and the third before classic hits. Yes there’s some retcons, there’s also some info in them that pertains solely to MOP. I’d still highly recommend them though. They’re a really neat look into the lore of the world and universe and if you aren’t familiar with the story as I wasn’t it was a really good time reading them. I feel like when classic hits I’ll already have more of an appreciation for world, and I haven’t read 2/3 volumes yet. 
---
Also the artwork in them is stellar. 
---
I always really enjoyed Enchanting while leveling. It was also a fantastic profession at 60. Highly recommended.
---
Lol I had a similar situation playing runescape with my cousin
---
Leggings of the Ursa
---
I didn't have any such addon, at first I thought it was built-it in the game.
---
But then, I tried without addons, and it didn't work. So, probably some library that some addon included.
---
If Blizzard were to include the updated player race models, should they also include updates to the non-playable races and creatures? Ever since Cata, Blizzard’s been slowly updating models for older creatures. Often times because those creatures are relevant again. We’ve seen updated models for things like scorpids, boars, yetis, hyenas, I think moonkin, and a bunch of others.
---
So if Blizzard allowed optional updated player models, what do you think about optional updated creature models?
---
That might be enough for rank 10, but for rank 12 you’d probably have to up it to 5-6 a day. 
---
It’s also massively pay to win. 
---
How many spawns and how often do Black Lotus's spawn?

I hope it does so spergs like you could get triggered

I can smell that mattress from here

Oh it’ll get you the flag with relative ease. Whether you make it out to midfield before you die depends on the support of your teammates.

Jews are greedy though. Now you're just being dishonest

Leveling speed being hardcore
---
As much as I've enjoyed the recent (almost all positive) news lately over classic, I doubt this is going to change much.  Costs a lot I guess for decent customer service.  Which kind of blows.  
---
Salem?
---
Not enough DoTs....
---
To this day I still don't understand the plot
---
You are correct. No traps while in combat. Also don't forget the dreaded deadzone for hunter range, which made you virtually useless in some circumstances. 
---
I was part of that vanilla movement on the private realms.  There were hundreds if not thousands of like minded fans that did what little we could to fight the wall of no.  I agree for years we were shunned for trying to progress the emulation scene, posting our opinions and trying get our voices heard.  What Nost did was to combine great advertising and hype with efficient realm management and created a monster.  Many look back on Nost fondly, I look back on nost as the realm that brought our scene to the mainstream and in turn pushed the vanilla movement to a place it was so prominent Blizzard HAD to react.  I thank the Nost team for being that group of individuals that pushed private realms to the point where players demanded professionalism.  Sadly what happened after Nost in the private scene was actually very saddening and embarrassing.  The profiteering and scamming has now almost destroyed the scene, with very few projects actually being run out of passion for wow and emulation.  
---
The reason for Classic is a combination of many factors, and I think the OP made a pretty good analysis of the latter stages, I personally would have liked to have seen more credit given to those that have pushed public updates to the emulation cores, as they are the real heros that gave Nost the tools to work with.
---
I was wondering that too since Blood Elves weren’t in Vanilla 🙄
---
This is great, thanks for sharing.
---
I don't. AV was better pre 1.12.
---
If you have good DPS it can go very smooth. The OP was asking about PUGs though, where most DPS will actively make tanking frustrating.
---
To tank a PUG in vanilla you need to actively manage, educate, and discipline DPS. Not everyone wants to do that.
---
I guess not. Same server content or bust.
---
Lol zinwrath throws plots out the window. 
---
Exhibit A: “Abraham Lincoln... yep. Abraham Lincoln...”
---
&gt; In order for a kickbot to work it should be able to detect if a spell is being cast, and a smart kickbot should be able to detect what is being cast.
---
I was thinking more of smart kick macros like only cast interrupt if target is casting and cast is at 99% and is interruptible. UnitCastingInfo() (or combat log parsing for vanilla) would work for this if CastSpellByName() isn't blocked.
---
&gt;I haven't played retail for a long while now, but I don't remember addons being able to equip items for you or detect item cooldowns and stuff like that. Correct me if i'm wrong :P
---
I think you're right about spell cooldowns, but you can have an addon create macros for you like /equipset name [stance:3, combat]) or /equipset name [swimming] and so on and have them all trigger when you press a single button. TrinketMenu seems to be updated for legion but I have no idea how the auto queue works.
---
&gt;Sure, but that doesn't prevent them from re-enabling (some of) the old API's, does it? Blizzard said that they are aiming for class balance and pvp/pve experience to be the same as it was back then, and I personally think that macros and addons play a big role in that.
---
99% of people didn't know how to abuse these macros/scripts back then so it's still mostly the same imo. You can't compare it to private servers.
---
Anyways, my point is that if you unlock things like cooldown checking for TrinketMenu, it has side effects that you can now create a button that does your entire rotation for you for a lot of classes. For equiping items, you'd end up with addons that automatically equips Skull of Impending and uses it before getting sheeped, scatter shot etc, or Eng reflect before a fear (Even if CC is instant it's still possible to dodge due to spellbatching delay). The side effects would be horrible for pvp. I don't see how blizz could prevent this unless they create the addons themselves.
---
You can also enable PvP on normal RP right? What is the difference anyways?
---
To split hairs, they should be even.
---
for reference 5 = 1 level i.e. Lv61
---
Prowl and Stealth are both Lv60×5=300
---
MoD and PI are both +15 so that's a wash
---
If a Rogue picks up 2 points in HS (which would be stupid imo but to each their own)  they recieve +6 detection.  Druids get +10 detection on their PvP gloves to counter.  Any offset items both can wear so that's a wash.
---
+5 for being Nelf (both could be, so wash)
---
Detection only applies in an 180degree cone in front of your character.  The real winner would be who ever is behind or equipped nightboots/poped catseye pot etc.  
---
Druids have an easier time dealing with lost stats for gimmicks like detection gear, more Druids are Nelf than Tauren, more rogues are Gnome/Dwarf than Nelf, and Druids likely have PvP gloves in situations where it matters while Rogues unlikely took Heightened Senses.  Rogues only retain the option to pop Vanish for 170 stealth bonus if they like to gamble.
---
Statistically, I think Druids are the better stealth class.  But, both classes really have the same opportunity afforded to them.
---

lots of people can play for long periods of time before getting burnt out. Just play on the private server until you get burnt out it's different for everyone 
---
What is the highest Fishing skill you can have?
---
Funny, these are the only two I remember word for word. I’m sure there’s another one about auto run?
---
&gt;with only one slow fall cast at the very top
---
I asked specifically for the cast done when you just took off though. 
---
In other words: Is the crater so deep that you will not reach ground before the cast expires?
---
Awesome insight. Since I am forced to pick SoC for leveling, would it be imposible to tank early dungeons as pally? Again, thank you for your insight.
---
Nefarian in his human form just talking shit 
---
Place a freezing trap, wait 20 seconds, pull the monsters and freeze one, feign death and freeze another, double CC
---
I'm playing on an instant 60 pvt server to see which one of my preferred classes I will end up playing. Because on Classic Server I just want to pvp at lvl 60. 
---
Yes.
---
I was also one of the ones that had everything maxed at 300. I don't recall Cooking really adding or providing significant raid buffs (as in retail) until later on around AQ/Naxx time frame if I recall correctly. As for Fishing I remember it being an insanely boring grind. The cast time was longer, you had a high chance of failing and when it failed it didn't count as a skill up. So the grind was real.
---
Holy! That's a real game changer that I didn't know. So that would mean 0 addons at launch?
---
I've never experimented with this but the tradeoff would be too big to take it for this reason.
---
No. Taurens have the same numerical value for their melee range and deadzone size. The difference is that their model is bigger, which means that everything is farther forward, including the deadzone. This bigger model size also means that you can be hit from farther away. 
---
This is a disadvantage in PVE for fights like Thaddius/Onyxia where you could be really up close, and either an advantage or a disadvantage in PVP depending on the situation. 
---
[This archive from TBC](https://web.archive.org/web/20080319141926/http://tkasomething.com/deadzone.php) offers some pretty good explanation, as that mechanic didn’t change in TBC and it was more heavily researched because of arenas. 
---
Nice ND footage lol
---
No, there is no chance blizzard will ever even comment on the popularity of classic as its population (at least for the first few months) will certainly overshadow BFA and in all fairness, that is a bad thing from a marketing perspective 
---
Poor guy is stuck playing FO76 now.
---
&gt;Actually, considering that you can't 100% partial resist the ticks, I suppose a binary initial application isn't really unfair.
---
The behavior I saw on Ebbnflows 300 shadow res Druid video was full resists for dots would tick for 1.  It's worth another look.
---
&gt; Got a source for that? Because in that second video, you can very clearly see &lt;10 people report an enemy in a RBG and have them kicked off.
---
Just my own experience, when we silenced our guildlie to test the system it took more than 10 to silence them, however this was in the open world, not in a BG. I can totally see a BG having different thresholds as for example in RBG's there's generally only to be 10 players possibly reporting someone since the format is 10 v.s. 10. So it would be kind of weird to require more than 10 reports in a BG. 
---
&gt;  It also sounds like you tried reporting them for chat abuse.
---
When we were trying to get the guildie silenced i think thats true.
---
When we tried to get the new account banned we tried every option in the book.
---
&gt;  It's also worth mentioning in that same vein that you claiming to have been unable to do something, doesn't really prove anything either. We have videos showing one thing, and you claiming another.
---
This is true ofcourse, however i thrust my own observations more than movies that could be altered / edited and the likes. For example, the report i mentioned earlier about the guy claiming to be banned after being right click reported during wpvp around X-mas was edited in a way that it looked like he could actually be banned through right click reporting. I feel that ppl are going off about movies way to fast, without actually testing stuff out themselves. 
---
&gt; Here's the thing either way, a disconnect and a silence in Classic WoW may as well be a ban for many players. Not being able to chat for 24 hours means you'll be able to participate in any group content outside of your guild, and you can't engage with trading outside of AH. Being able to talk is a very, very important part of vanilla. But what's just as bad is the disconnect. Disconnecting an enemy who's tanking a world boss? Well, the damage will already be done, ban or not. World bosses like Azuregos has mechanics that means if you wipe you can't re-engage right away and you might've just given the other guild the kill.
---
Now yes, this might have a impact. This is also why this should be monitored closely. And ppl abusing the feature should be banned themselves imho if they try to use it for a (competitive) advantage. 
---
Plate w stamina is huge on your levelling game.  You can have a few pieces of huge leather upgrades though... I wouldn't skip inviting people because of it.
---
The difference lies in the fact that PvP becomes another threat in game out in the open world no matter what. It adds another element of always being on the hunt or being hunted. 
---
I think op's memory might be off by a few years.

Frost ward will get consumed before ice barrier and the damage that gets passed to you is calculated after dampen magic. 
---
I’ve played a mage on Vanilla priv-servers for years now. That being said, what I am about to say may or may not be 100% accurate in Classic WoW. 
---
To answer your question(s): 
---
I’m not sure what you mean by “apply to ice barrier...”. Dampen magic reduces the magic damage (and healing) affecting you. So if I understood you right, yes, it does affect Ice Barrier but not Mana Shield. E.g. a frostbolt will hit you for 80 instead of 100 thus the Ice Barrier will last longer. Mana Shield only protects against physical damage, so neither dampen magic nor spell resistance will “affect” it. 
---
IIRC, it will be the frost ward that gets broken first if you get hit by frost spells. Same goes for fire ward if you get struck with fire spells. 
---
Ice Barrier/Mana Shield - Ice Barrier gets struck down first if you get hit with physical damage. 
---
I have it on my EU account and don't really care... only wish they would link items EU to US and back.. 
---
I'm just excited because I still have the same SOAD tour shirt!
---
I know some craigslist BBCs that can do all of those things for you sweetie.
---
Hey don't bring us players with Aspergers into this. Some of us are quite interested in having updated graphics and shit in classic. God knows I want the current gnome and female dwarf models to be in classic.
---
No, but I’ve been thinking about it. I want to keep myself clean for classic release. I just play other games. However classic can’t come fast enough.
---
but WOW was using only one core, anyway
---
Or maybe all the people you were annoying by reading your carry messages.
---
Yes, that P.E. gym smell
---
Mine has gone too large, thanks to the gym.
---
Yes, it works! It should’ve said “does not work in shadow form” or something similar otherwise. 
---
that's Carbonite map
---
yes
---
Aren't all the bop recipe robes prebis? And then there's bloodvine in VG which is ridiculously good (but very ugly)
---
I really don’t think it’s necessary to remove. It’s just too useful. People overblown how abusable it is. Most of these posts are completely lacking in evidence. It also requires a lot of coordination even if it really were abusable. The odds of someone getting wrongfully punished will be so rare that it justifies using this. It’s not going to be used every single day on everyone all the time. You can literally look to retail to see how it’s not a realistic problem. 
---
Depends on what kind of beta blizz has.  If app developers have beta access most of the popular add ons will be available.
---
Inshallah, RP-PvP shall be available from launch come Classic 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
---
Thought about it, I'm in.
---
Nelf warrior. Weird looking back.
---
The sound of cooking always made me hungry for steak. 
---
I think as leveling DPS clothies they really don’t care too much about getting loot. They can’t afford to be picky. Maybe the healer can but that’s about it. While leveling I think most people regarding all armor and weapon types really want to complete quests and loot is optional.
---
This sounds like private servers being private servers. I can't recall seeing a 1 damage tick in all of my retail gaming experience. I didn't play a Warlock but I've seen plenty of Pyroblast DoTs or ignite ticks in my life.
---
*Tinder Flashbacks intensifies*
---
Deadzone size remains the same, just the range is changed to 8-15 yards, instead of the normal 5-12 yards.  Yes, this difference is noticeable .
---
This means you have an easier time going in for a wingclip than you do jumping back for a concussive shot.
---
This also means enemies can melee you back from 8 yards away instead of 5.  To put that in perspective, melee attacks have 62.5% longer reach against Tauren.  This is also why Tauren Druids have a more difficult time travel form shifting out of hamstring spam vs nelf Druids.
---
The disparity is very noticeable when two Tauren duel as both of their hitboxes apply.
---
Bis chest for priest, lock and mage for a while. Mooncloth CD makes a little passive gold. 
---
IDK about locks, but mage and priests can make some superb epic robes for MC raiding (arguably beyond). Also dont underestimated the value of bags in classic.
---
Lol. I honestly think we won't get anything since literally everyone expects it
---
They're going to actually announce the release date, but everyone will think it's an April Fools' joke which will be the joke.
---
But you can't look to retail because of the anonymity afforded by retail. People get VERY salty in vanilla WoW. And after the run is over, you don't just slip away never to be heard of again. You see that same person that trolled you sitting in town later that day....and he /rude's you. 
---
People are going to be spamming the hell out of this feature for so many different reasons. Take my gather node a couple times? spam report. Members of rival guild? spam report. In game enemy/rivals? spam report. There is so much less interaction with other players in retail that I can see this feature being fine for that game. But this is not retail and this feature will be awful in classic.
---
So many people on this sub are the same boat lmfao. People at my job think it's hilarious that I'm taking a week off to play video games. 
---
Robe of the Archmage is very good. Bloodvine is ugly as sin but BiS in ZG. Bags are good steady help and mooncloth makes a little gold every few days. 
---
&gt; just the range is changed to 8-15 yards, instead of the normal 5-12 yards.
---
The deadzone is between 5 and 8 yards. 
---
Yep, I played a druid in Vanilla and I thoroughly enjoyed mindlessly ganking in Red Ridge. Druid was perfect for RR because you could hit the lake, seal form, and disappear. Best part of this was all of the white knights flying in to help their buddies. They'd look like fools because you could pretty much gank their friend and get away right in front of them. 
---
I think bags are going to be big sellers, people are spoiled by the number of bag slots on retail.
---
Can’t speak to the Mage or Priest one, but for Warlocks Robe of the Void is fantastic.
---
Make it classic #nochanges, hardcopy! 😂
---
I thought the orc racial was better for rogue?  I don’t remember specifics as I haven’t played in years.  I do remember all rogues basically rolling combat swords though.  At one point I had a Gnome rogue - because I like gnomes and I like rogues and I don’t care about the meta.  And I got blasted for running subtlety with daggers.  It fit what I envisioned my characters persona.  I left that guild.  They were toxic.  Play what you want is my opinion.  Of course I never raided Naxx, nor did I ever care too.
---
So I never messed with cooking and fishing in classic but picked it up when I returned for WoD. 
---
Recently playing on a pserver I tried to make a pretty dedicated effort to keep my cooking up... but it seemed around 50-75 there was only a single recipe I could cook that required INSANE amounts of materials.
---
Anyone got a guide out there for suggested recipes to avoid just ENDLESSLY grinding plainstriders or whatever? The meat sources seem to get dramatically outlevelled pretty quick..
---
kys
---
Lock can banish if fear pulls an add. Forgot about this, but used to do that :D
---
But is there a difference in rules comparing PvP to RPPvP then? Or is it that you want likeminded people in a single server?
---
You will look silly in bloodvine gear anyways for a long time during raids, better hiding it in a gnome instead.
---
Are you trying to tell me that dog isn't actually playing WoW? Lying shit.
---
That confirms is then, warlock was the only one I wasn't 100% sure about.
---
Naw the dogs actually looking up porn.
---
tanks priests hunters and rogues look pretty good in bis
---
Not to be snooty but if there wasn't a difference then we'd only have PvE servers.  Some RPers just want the additional experiences that PvP servers bring added to their core RP fluff.  A majority even, by the latest polls.
---
Dang. I think I'll have to pick troll over undead now. Taurens are my fave but can't be many classes I like. 
---
Agreed!
---
I remember having to disable a bunch of other addons just to get my game to run with Carbonite, just for those in-game google maps. 
---
Just don't phase out the old animations like retail did.
---
You had an old model checkbox but your character still had same animations.
---
Agreed, nothing more to add.
---
Blizz pls gives us at least one RpPvP server for NA and one for EU. There are clearly enough players to fill one server.
---
We aren't sure, as graphics can be determined by quality of assets, and there have been many in play over how's history.
---
Though the devs did say they are working with the 1.12 version of the game, so I'd assume it will have those graphics settings and art assets.
---
I’d rather not figure out how to get my Tauren to Gnomer. 
---
Thanks! Maybe I’ll make a run at the chops. I’m planning on going alliance, but the best cooks are courageous lol
---
You're probably right.  I'm so excited to test stuff at launch though.  Lol
---
It's about the community basically. RpPvP servers tend to be less competitive and players care more about immersion and taking the game slowly. Also there is no xxLegoolasxx and Shadowhuntar around. It's just genrally a different experience than regular PvP servers and some players prefer that experience. 
---
Right on!
---
I’m looking forward to giving it a shot. I’ll be rolling warrior, so I’m hoping it will come in handy.
---
Sure if wow was their very first video game.
---
Shadow guard and hex of weakness are two diffrent things. Shadow guard does proc blackout and spirit tap, but hex does no damage thus it can not proc any of the above.
---
For bgs, do you consider yourself a very technical player with a lot of pvp experience enough to were you can fully manage a pet and yourself?  In vanilla your pets is basically another player.
---
If you see yourself as this type of player who loves become very technical with your game play then play sm ruin spec, just google it you’ll find what you need.
---
If you see yourself as a casual player that isn’t very technical but you love pvp then play sl nightfall.
---
If you’re a player who like to play bgs at an all or nothing type of gameplay where you might get destroyed but you can also 2 shot people play full destro

Live blizzard hosted page to view? No

But, if they open the API like 8.x version then you will see sections on [https://realmpop.com](https://realmpop.com) or some other service that pings for stats.

But that IS if they open up that functionality in the API.

That´s not true. Battlemaster were added in 1.6, before that you had to go the the battleground entrance.

You'll be surprised (or disappointed) by just how many people roll PvP servers and then spend the bulk of their time moaning about the inconvenience world PvP has on them.
---
This is the reason Blizz continually put up barriers to world PvP as Retail wore on, and we can only hope they don't eventually end up doing the same thing to Classic.
---
Honesty I never got a chance to really give it a go like I have for all of the other “meme specs” Blizzard has had. Im looking forward to getting in there and figuring out what works and doesn’t work with the specs. If they’re like Outlaw and Survival were in Legion then yeah they are a carry class. If you can actually overcome the deficiencies with good gear, speccing, and rotations then great. :)

dude this is my point. You have no evidence that this will actually happen yet you talk about it like it is a guarantee.

After bloodvine are there any good craftable tailoring pieces.  I have full bloodvine so what i want to know is should i save mooncloth for better recipes or just sell them
---
If the person who won the roll has a full inventory the item stays on the mob instead and anyone can pick it up at that point.

What about the guy who got DC'ed and silenced for saying "I love World of Warcraft", which his guildmates reported?

Woops thank you.  I was just trying to dump everything in my head all at once.  Lol
---
&gt;As a priest, I hate when people beg me for fortitude since they never bought scrolls of stamina off the AH.

and for the surveillance features. It was showing the position of all other guildmates, who had this addon, even if they were not in your group.

But well.... BLAH!

Gonna have 2 characters.   A hunter for farming and my druid for end game healing.  Druid to 60 first then efficient rested xp grind on the hunter.
---
O.o Do you need more coffee this morning.

Uh. No? You can multibox 2 characters on 2 accounts. . AT a TIME that is.
---
Curious as to how you think you can load 5 characters into world on 2 accounts though. 
---
Worry not, my bovine friend. There's a quest at Orgrimmar's engineering trainer which allows you to teleport from Booty Bay to Gnomeregan.

Great, thank you for the perfect explanation!

i know yogscast litterally had encrypted guild chat because someone reported something edgy in chat to a gm.

"We have re-evaluated the plan for Classic WoW and since we don't want several MMORPG's to maintain at the same time Classic will instead be a goblin teleporter that allows BfA players to visit the old world instance in their current gear."

"Or maybe it's because you were annoying! /whine /cry". He was trying to sell his services/items. Who cares if he is annoying? 0 justification for a report.

Everyone should always have First Aid trained. Mana is limited, and the Healer is not omnipresent when you're grinding. It would be like forgoing the ability to give your car free gasoline, since mobs drop so much cloth you're basically drowning in it.
---
4 discs or riot.

Warlocks can actually do quite well.  In either area for demons (Winterspring Gorge or Blasted Lands) they can enslave an elite and tear through the other demons with the enslaved one as a pet.

I mean you still have other options

1. NO. Do NOT roll back. And you can do some of what you want to do with Gnome Sequencer today. So its till there.
---
2. WHAT? Ok, this hurts no one and gets people into the game quicker. Mind you the download will not be as long to get all assets as the assets are smaller than current 8.x But what? 
---
3. Yea.. ok.. Because so many people used that in the first place. It was niche but its nice to know they are replicating it.
---
4. We don't need moonwalking. Bug fixes are bug fixes.
---
But all this was to just say. API will be modern to protect the playerbase. Provided the modified API works similarly to 8.x then just use  GSE: Gnome Sequencer Enhanced : Advanced Macros.

I can't speak for RP PVP realms way back when, but from MoP to Legion there was virtually 0 RP on these realms. They were simply PVP realms.

Massive Attack - Mezzanine (the whole album).

How does t2 not require a huge time commitment lol.
---
"Disk Access Throttling" wow... I've been out-WoWed this time
---
I really don't understand their reasoning for not including at least one RP-PVP server for both US and EU. I don't see how it could hurt them financially and I guarantee those servers would be have a stable community.
---
I multibox 40 on retail and have never abused my ability to mass report on an actual player but there are several bots that always seem to be farming in my turf so I’ve tried reporting cheating and name x40 and seemingly nothing happened. No dc and the bots were all still there every day for the past week.

I’ve seen this “wow classic” photo before on another reddit thread. I don’t believe that this is OP without a recent photo

Couple questions, been a lot of years I've forgotten some things.
---
Was instant-quest text a feature during 1.12, or did it come with TBC? If not, I recall there was an addon (questhelper?) that automatically made text show instantly.
---
On that note, can we expect old-school addons such as AtlasLoot, Gatherer and all those top addons to make a comeback again?  There was also a really cool addon which kept the original player portraits but made the inner bit animated, so your character's head was moving around. Pretty cool.
---
Because of the influx of Chinese farmers that were farming honor on ppls accounts while they were offline to grind to Rank 14, would you say that players win trading in wsg when matched against other ATK pre-mades was a necessary evil to compete with people whos accts were being farm boosted.
---
Hmmm, what a dilemma
---
It’s pretty frustrating watching guys that never played vanilla talk about it like it’s the greatest thing.     
---
Commenting like they’re historians and have no idea how we even got to vanilla Warcraft. They should be making videos on EQ, SWG, and Lineage 2
---
Yeah OP is coming off as very selfish and clearly doesn’t sound like someone I’d want to group with. 
---
I sure hope so. But if not then whatever that's okay.
---
Love how the original Outlands it on there
---
Some bosses fear. also while trolls are a little better at PvE, undead are leagues better at PvP.
---
Enjoy\~
---
Welcome to our camp mate, good to have you!
---
Almost certain it was in the game. You just had to turn it on, in options.
---
I went there [once in tbc](https://i.imgur.com/7aeTq3Y.jpg) while doing some exploring. (Although this is facing away from the area)
---
It's weird because the terrain was completely normal whereas most out of bounds areas are flat, this was a properly crafted valley that was completely impossible to get to without walljumping.
---
Probably a scrapped part of desolace or something I guess.

Haha no, but that guy went to my high school. I'm the one talking about Horde

Holy mother f\*ck sh\*t balls. They seriously removed those options!?

Yeah dude, I'm not surprised that someone as toxic as you is surrounded by other toxic people. That's why your evidence points towards toxic use.

Druids don’t solo it, they 2-man it with a rogue once they are decently geared (stuff like full T2).

Hell yeah! I rocked a 2008 era Inspiron as my main PC during The Burning Crusade (I started playing Jan 2007). That thing would not die. Literally played hundreds of hours of WoW on it and tried to pawn it off on different friends and family members. It always came back to me and never died. 
---
One year a thief stole our car right from our driveway on Christmas Eve with the laptop in the car. We got the car back but the laptop was held at the police station as evidence or whatever. I never went to inquire about it thus the end of my Dell Inspiron.
---
Fast forward to 3 months ago my dad gives me his 2013 era Dell Inspiron and it's the total spiritual successor! Great specs, 17 inch, etc...
---
Can't wait to use it if I ever raid at a buddies house or whatever.. it will be like old times!!
---
To Dell, for making the most ruggedized, WoW-friendly laptops known to man.
---
They aren't that bad man, sounds like your biased without being immersed in them. I have a word models patch for a few of the bigger private servers and it was great. They do not look like kids. This guy may been too far gone for reason though so maybe we should just leave him to is false thoughts and ideas.
---
I always feel that awesomely overwhelming excitement when I see Teldrassil. It was the very first place I saw Dec. 2004. I am so pumped to play through Teldrassil again.

[Mine just arrived.](https://imgur.com/gallery/99JSecy)

I'm stuck between melee and ranged classes. How was combat back then for both. Especially with the new spell batching. I'll do pvp and pve. (priest for ranged or rogue for melee)
---
I’m wondering if people base it off of pservers or retail.
---
I believe all of the T2 raids have weeklong lockouts. If you got one piece every week, that’s 6 weeks at minimum.
---
If one piece for your class drops THAT consistently, you should have played the lotto.
---
Now consider that you have multiple of your class in every raid. Unless you’re the guild leader (or a steamer 😒), the rest of your raid isn’t going to be happy that you’re the only one getting consistent gear....so the likelyhood if it taking less than 2-3 months is very, very low.
---
Nice shirt
---
Defias Brotherhood EU had tons of RP from Wrath to WoD where it sorta died out. 
---
I am a school teacher. I am just hoping for a pre-august release.
---
I believe in has said they were only going to use it at launch and they are well aware what sharding can do to a community.
---
Yeah it sounds absurd and I couldn't believe it as well since they seem to emphasis working on your looks/mounts and pets to be some kind of content, but for the live of me I've been reading every single possible option about 10 times and couldn't find it.
---
I don't have anything against streamers and I did watch some demo streams.
---
But the moment Classic lunches, it will be a long time before I think about watching streams again.
---
As for being in the same server as streamer... "laughs in europe".
---
Check out the retro-wow private server. Instant 60 and it helped me get a feel for what I think I'll like. Odds are you'll still end up with a bunch of alts but it definitely helps to narrow it down.
---
Warlock peaked in mop and I can't even enjoy the class anymore with what they've taken away.
---
RP-PVP is the best server type because the people on it can type complete sentences and they also aren't afraid to mix it up in a fight.
---
What they said was "in a limited way" and "in a time limited way". That doesn't mean ONLY launch. The wording is intentionally left vague.
---
Likewise, just because they say they know what sharding would do doesn't mean they won't do it anyways. For example, a thief knows they shouldn't steal, but they do it anyways.
---
Thanks, I still have it. 
---
Me, toxic. Good one bro
---
As a druid back in vanilla, I was pretty content with just doing mara princess runs by stealthing to her and then also killing rotgrip.
---
On a further note, I would also just hunt devilsaurs back before I had any idea of what a devilsaur mafia was... the sets would only sell for like 50g/75g for gloves/legs but it added up quick.
---
The few times I did try doing tribute runs, I would mess because I was a shitter,  or it would just take too long and not net me as much gold as other strategies.
---
There is none yet. As far as I know, their last statement still states "summer 2019".
---
Thank You!!
---
Blizzard's community severing policies were already in full swing by MoP.  (cross server dungeon finder, etc)
---
Does that mean that taurens cannot abuse other hunters' deadzone?
---
This is the kind of thing that I don't even expect confirmation for because I assume its going to be there. There is absolutely no reason not to have some, but since there hasn't been official word on it, people assume that it might not happen? Current wow doesn't have realm types so wouldn't every realm type be up in the air with that logic? I kind of think of this like.. they haven't said that you can make a human paladin. It doesn't have to be confirmed because it wasn't even debated on. Of course it is going to be there. 
---
Watch mostly uncut videos for each run.  
---
Watch the longer ones again.  LBRS, UBRS are first to come to mind.  
---
If you know where you are going, and act like it's old news, you'll be MT in MC in no time.  
---
Tab target tanking is only as hard as the DPS make it.  
---
You certainly don't have to be raid leader or GM, but in smaller groups just expect to be leader and marking targets.  
---
It is also not uncommon for the guild bank to pay for the MT's enchants / repairs / consumables.  
---
Know the run / mechanics, and be reliable on attendance and you've just outclassed a huge chunk of other tanks.  
---
Best of luck
---
I was gonna edit that, but your reply is better.
---
I think we Europeans have a very glorified picture of American college
---
Holy shit this looks amazing, thanks!!
---
I bet there will be add-ons for classic for better graphics
---
&gt;Kind of irrelevant
---
Not really, look at the language of the talent.
---
&gt;Gives your Shadow damage spells a x% chance to stun the target for 3 seconds.
---
It doesn't say "chance to stun the target on dealing damage," it just makes it so when you cast a spell that does shadow damage you have a chance to stun the target, so casting SW:P can proc it while the ticks themselves don't.  
---
Since Hex of Weakness does no damage, it's not considered a shadow damage spell so it won't proc Blackout.  Compare that to Touch of Weakness or Shadowguard, both of which have an "apply aura proc trigger spell" effect, meaning when you are hit, the aura "casts" the damaging spell for you, so they also can proc Blackout.
---
It was most peoples first MMO and the hardware we were all playing on was bad also. it was a different time, don't judge with todays standards.
---
Agreed. Plus he had the big beard that bled through every helmet. It was the worst! Love the class though
---
My apologies you’re absolutely right 
---
You can do ragefire at level 13
---
The execute and BT lines intersecting around 1500 AP seems to be throwing me off a bit, but in general the concept makes sense.  The Execute line seems to reflect an opportunity cost of the rage while the other lines seem to indicate just the damage as a function of AP. I could be totally misreading this though.
---
Another potential conclusion would be that low rage executes are worth prioritizing, even at extremely high levels of AP - curious for your thoughts on this.
---
This guide is a great resource and is very well written - thank you for sharing it!
---
I max out cooking on all my characters.  I only max fishing on one character though.  I play Horde, and this is what I do:
---
1-50: Whatever meat is available when you're starting out.  UD and Tauren can kill wolves, Troll and Orc kill boars.
---
50-100:  Buy the recipe for Strider Stew I think it is, trade vendor is xroads sells it.  Kill all Plainstriders around The Barrens until you reach 100.  Innkeeper sells the apples and water.
---
100-125: Same vendor sells a recipe for Thunder Lizard tails or something like that.  Once you're in Southern Barrens you can farm up tons of them.
---
125-175: The butcher in Crossroads sells recipe for Hot Lion Chops.  You can farm the cats in Hillsbrad while questing to get the meats.  You can also do Soothing Turtle Bisque.
---
175-225:  Mix of recipes, basically anything that involves cats, dogs, and raptors.  So you can get Roast Raptor and Curiously Tasty Omelete for raptor meat and raptor eggs.  Jungle Stew for tiger meat, Hot Wolf Ribs and Carrion Surprise from dogs.  These recipes are sold in Grom'Gol (Roast Raptor and Jungle Stew), Ghost Walker Post (Carrion Surprise), Hammerfall (Omelete), and Feralas (Hot Wolf Ribs).  You can also get the wolf ribs recipe from the Super Seller robot that patrols through Desolace, if you're lucky.
---
This is also the level range where you can make good gold off cooking since the mats to make each food is around 2 silver if you were to vendor the meat, 3 silver if you cook it and vendor it.
---
225-300:  Usually I have enough Tender Wolf Meat from killing dogs that I can make Tender Wolf Steak.  I basically just mail all that meat to an alt until I'm ready to cook it.  It's not worth vendoring the cooked meat here so, for me, I only make this food to level up cooking and to supply my characters with 12 sta food buffs.  Recipe is sold by the goblin in Tanaris that gives you the artisan food quest.
---
Even on a fresh start, I can max cooking this way by the time I'm around level 40.  After that I just cook the level 25 foods (that give 8 sta) and vendor them.  Combined with Skinning, you can make a lot of gold just vendoring skins and cooked meats.
---
You have to do it through a transmog NPC now. 
---
I have it narrowed down between rogue, warrior, mage, or priest. They're all classes that are actually good at their roles, and they're also all classes I'd enjoy playing in both pve/pvp. The main debate in my head is whether I should play the same thing as I did in vanilla(rogue) since I know how great and fun it is or do I switch? 
---
Then there's the question of whether expansion will ever be released. I say this because hunter, druid, and warlock are all imo pretty meh and sometimes even a bit shit but they all become ridiculously good in TBC. Warlocks are so overwhelmingly better than mages in TBC it's unreal. Hunters are a top tier dps class with literally only one button, and TBC resto druid was so fun and also effective. 
---
You can also enable PvP on PvE right? What is the difference anyways?
---
Yea, that whole zone was nice.  Not only did it look awesome, but I like that they put various quests in caves and dens in keeping with the natural theme.  Plus the rogue quest where they put the satyr you have to kill on a branch hanging over the side of teldrassil was a cool touch.
---
Thanks! This has been really helpful.
---
Unfortunately I’ll be rolling Alliance (it’s what my friends want to do), but this is an awesome guide!
---
Unfortunately, I don't know much about the leveling phase since I'll be leveling with a Warrior friend who will do the tanking part.
---
I guess the most important talent is Consecration as it will enable your tanking and help your damage as Ret aswell. I'd rush 11 in Holy for Consecration and then put the rest in Ret, so you'll be level 31 when you hit SoC (11/0/11). Without the prot tree though, Righteous Fury will not be as strong so I don't know if threat will be an issue.
---
Is Druid in typical deep resto?
---
No, since taurens can hit from farther away but can also be hit from farther away. Read the link I posted on top of the thread. 
---
&gt; However, a Night Elf Hunter and Tauren Hunter will always be in range to fire or melee each other at the exact same time, since both are using targeted abilities that take into account their combined displacement values.
---
If they have never played before, making a free account and leveling to 20 might help.  Sure, it will be different due to expansions, but it should let them know how they like the playstyle.  Or have them try out a private server briefly to get a general idea.
---
Thanks mate. I noticed you didn't have pre-raid MH or OH listed. The OH would still be the Drakestone of Shadow Wrath. MH will be Witchblade dropped from Darkmaster Gandling in Scholomance. Prior to Witchblade, you'll want to grab Inventor's Focal Sword from Tinkerer Gizlock in Maraudon (easily solo'd at 60)
---
Instant quest text was in the game. Even prior to 1.12 
---
It has nothing to do with pservers, they have the same lockouts as retail vanilla.  I agree, there’s no way you could be a casual raider and just be given 8/8 t2.  The more dedicated priests will get their sets first, then you might finish it by the time AQ launches.
---
I really hope there won't be new graphics in Classic. It's also a great way to distinguish retail and classic for newcomers.
---
At some point your dungeon will get cancelled due to a group of better geared players just messing around in the area murdering everyone repeatedly.
---
They moved the option to do that from the Options menu.
---
You now have to visit a transmogrifier to hide them. You can also hide shoulders, and soon will be able to hide any item except pants.
---
It’s free to hide those slots, if you transmogrify them into a visible appearance there is a cost associated with the procsss. 
---
Man, this setup reminds me of my TBC days. Every friday after school my friends and I would go to our friend Sams house, his garage more specifically, and do 5v5 arenas. The funny thing is only Sam had a desk in there, the rest of us had to use whatever we could find as a desk and chair. My go to set up was the ironing board and apple box. 
---
As said in the post if you make a copy of your own you will see Alternatives listed in dropdown menus. 
---
This includes these items :)
---
Boss: *We're under attack! A vast, ye swabs! Repel the invaders!*
---
NA Emerald Dream was one of the best and most populated RP-PvP servers. It isn't what it used to be now. Well, most servers arn't what they used to be.
---
There isn't really any 'sweet leather' for anything other than endgame.
---
I'll admit that if I'm trying to form a group I'll try to whisper some classes that don't give me much competition, but I'm not going to be overly douchey about it during leveling instances.
---
I do LOL at warriors who are looking for a tank though. It's one thing to dps for a group that already has a tank, but you shouldn't be playing warrior if you refuse to tank imo, especially with how much they are needed.
---
I have almost every CE pet in the game minus TBC, OW and BFA and i'd be more than happy to buy another CE for Vanilla as my little zergling has followed me through my adventures for a very long time and i'd love for him to be able to continue these adventures.
---
Maybe if they are standard on Classic and HD ones on retail for people that collect pets on retail but still different between Retail CE and Classic CE to keep the " Muh prestige " people happy as i think more people should be able to get one of these unique pets without forking out $2,000 + depending where you live.
---
I dunno Maybe you could also toss in Classic Beta to entice more people to buy it, hey Blizz **HINT HINT**
---
Ah okay my bad. Fair enough
---
Omg I feel so stupid right now :/
---
Can you pm me the name of the server? It's against rules to post it here but you can PM me and is it any good?
---
T2 requires turning up to raids regularly. 3 hours of time for 2-3 nights per week. I imagine that to obtain r10 you would need to spend a lot longer playing. 
---
Fair point
---
I wouldn’t. It was a menu option for 7-8 years before they moved it.
---
It makes sense to have it as a mog option, instead of a menu option, but I can see how it would reasonably be unintuitive for a returning player. 
---
Dampen Magic was nerfed in 1.12 to always let 50% spelldamage pass through. And before that you could use it for the Sons of Ragnaros phase to dodge the manaburn aura of the sons and aoe bomb them away. This was quite a secret in vanilla raiding. Was fun while it lasted I guess. 
---
You're absolutely correct. It's been a long time and had in my mind it being shadow spells. Which is dumb cause I know I've never heard of mind control stunning someone.
---
Good looks!
---
Well to be fair, mages are quite addicting once you get the hang of them. But how can one hate the master piece that is Dun Morogh? Blasphemy!
---
You look way too much into the exact grammar of people. I think people are just running out of shit to bitch about and people always need something to bitch about.
---
They won't shard the AQ event after everything they've said already. Doesn't make any sense for them to do this. There is no logical thought process that points in that direction... 
---
Sounds like a good compromise.  People who want the improved models can have them and the diehard purists can glare silently at that box whenever they're in the options menu.
---
unless you remove the combat log, people are gonna know your dps regardless, so i dont really mind that one. 
---
Cooldowns, I guess you mean weakauras? Which I'd absolutely agree on. 
---
Threat, don't care either way personally.
---
As long as I get to change my button UI, I'm happy
---
If only...if only...
---
I played more characters and also some other horde characters before i played blood elf. What im trying to say is how much i played alliance in comparison to horde. sorry if it seems a bit of, ofcourse it doesnt take 2 years to get to 18
---
Youre right. Guess my mind is to much towards retail where everything is about the endgame. In classic it is about the journey :)
---
No problem, thanks for the tip about Tinkerers MH
---
Oh I invented that for myself, my raidlead never let me tank anything tho.
---
There was a quick comment from a blizzard dev video where they said there aren’t plans for an RP - PvP server for classic. 
---
I agree entirely that this should be an option. However, I do wonder why so many people here want the new models. Anybody mind explaining why they prefer them?
---
I think they're way too silly, and it feels like they're made of goo. The faces are especially "gooey" and "floaty", and most races' running animations make me question if they have bones in their bodies at all. I get the old models are dated, but the new ones just feel way too comical and out of place IMO. I think it's especially bad with human females and undead males.
---
We all learned how to raid the first time around.  I don't see why you couldn't as long as you have the time and inclination.
---
Thats true. I can go to every zone, especially as a rogue ;) also i would like to quest in zones like Duskwood which i never did before. Thanks for your reaction, i think im going night elf :D
---
It's not that different for Alliance.  I rarely play the faction but 1-50 is again whatever is abundant in your starting area.  
---
After that you just work with whatever recipes you find in the next zone you go to, like I would assume Darkshore has lots of cats, crawlers, and bears so there's likely a recipe somewhere between there and Darnassus that will get you to 100 or so.  I leveled up a Gnome Mage to 60 a while back and had no trouble finding recipes and leveling the skill using whatever local beasts will drop the meats.
---
Like one I didn't mention:  If you're grinding jaguars outside Stonard for xp and mount gold, you can kill the spiders, and likely will have to due to aggro at times, then cook Spider Sausage for 12 sta buff and leveling.
---
For this grind, I advise mailing all Tiger Meat to an alt standing in Xroads or Grom to do the tiger meat cooking...or have an alt mail you the water and apples from those spots.  Spiders also drop spider silks that Tailors and Leatherworkers will want around 35-40 for things like Spider Belt and Swift Boots.
---
Can the resulting thistle tea be sold though?
---
I still use "Blit" to this day
---
Theres no logical thought process that turns Vanilla into the garbage fire that is BFA, and yet here we are. Blizzard has over a decade of terrible decision making under their belt. It isn't far fetched for them to make another terrible decision.
---
And those exact specifics are important, because while a company will never outright lie to their players, they will twist the truth if they can. Like how EA said it was possible to unlock everything in Battlefront without paying, despite 1000 hours to unlock Darth Vader being completely unrealistic. It was technically possible to unlock him without paying, but that doesn't make what they did okay. 
---
Until we have specifics, given Blizzard's track record, I absolutely do not trust them with sharding.
---
If you flag for PvP on a PvE server you just get ganked. You don’t get a chance to initiate world PvP simply because no one else is flagged. 
---
Interesting. I wonder what the reasoning there is. Since RP - PvP servers are basically just pvp servers with the added tag, I cant see why they wouldn't have it. Its just basically couple of extra "rules" and to make it easier to coordinate all the people who want that on the same server. I can imagine that if they won't add those that community will choose one realm for that purpose anyway. By the rate they are going about all the issues, I really doubt that this will be the one that they won't do, but we will see.
---
Yep,  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0bZxxMoZVtsoeq0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0bZxxMoZVtsoeq0o)  is the one he runs in that video.
---
Man you just reminded me of when I use to be a gold farmer as a teenager farming DM as a warlock. My parents always wondered how I had some money without a job. 
---
That's bannable
---
RP Started out strong, ended without closing.
---
For someone who wants RP-PVP but couldn't commit to an entire post I must ask, do you really want RP-PVP? 
---
Would be lovely if mana burn procced it
---
The only way I can back a new models option is if the new models get heavy adjustments to better mirror their low-rez counterparts. The HD models we have now take way too much creative license when they should be as close to 1:1 perfect upscale as possible.
---
I don’t want any traces of my modern WoW human’s stupid spiky pineapple beard (and other such dumb changes) coming to classic. The only HD models that should ever be an option in classic should be nearly indistinguishable from the old models with detail levels being the only change.
---
Omg Chamillionaire! Yessss
---
I'm guessing the rogue would evasion tank the fights? 
---
We don't know yet if Blizzard will allow DM: North to be soloed. They might change it.
---
Other than that, I think you're better off farming something else (If druid solo is even possible. Never heard of it until I saw your post)
---
Every company makes bad decisions but blizzard's toxicity towards wow didnt start until WotLK. However I believe that is an arguement that only revolves around opinions. 
---
I just think you're looking way to far into this.
---
 "Ion said blah blah blah blah but he left out 4 words and its because they plan to use sharding through out classic.#
---
Blizzard = illuminati 
---
Illuminati confirmed 
---
ALIENS
---
Oh man, some good pvp in Stranglethorn Vale with Disturbed on. 
---
I have my bank alt parked at the AH 24/7 while playing on my main. I have 9 other alts parked at rare vendor spawns. I can monitor the AH for deals, flipping opportunities, and cycle through 9 toons to see if Pattern: Mooncloth is up, or if the Felcloth vendor has items all without missing a moment of play on my main character.
---
Those 10 toons will be parked where they are as of like 10 hours into the servers going live. That's hundreds of hours of dibs on these items (as soon as i get a small amt of gold to send to each)
---
All without impacting my main.
---
DUDE, he's in the basement, where all WOW players LIVE.
---
Go for it!  Interacting with people is definitely the best way to experience the game, even though it won't always be positive, especially on a PvP server.  
---
Wotlk was 10 years ago. Like I said, theres been a decade of bad decisions.
---
And if you think it's a conspiracy theory for someone to think that a company that has made 10 years worth of bad decisions would make yet another bad decision, well...
---
Honestly I expect something like this to happen. I don’t have a wow sub right now but I’m renewing when classic rolls out
---
You’re a master chef
---
Yes absolutely. I’ve played many games on many server types and WoW RP - PvP has always been my favorite followed by anything RP. 
---
When me and my brother first talked about leveling together on Classic I asked him what server type we would roll on and he looked at me like I had 6 heads. There was never really a question that we would roll on anything other than RP - PvP. 
---
Consideration of racials was *much* less of a thing in Vanilla. I'm sure it happened, but the vast majority of people playing at the time didn't know/care which race was mechanically best for which class; they just played whatever they thought was cool.
---
I just hope they have 1 server for each region. 
---
The only fight, which is King Gordok, yes. They stealth past everything else. 
---
Just getting back into it after years of not playing, what are good huds these days for setting up your attacks and keeping tabs on player Heath? I used to know all the good stuff to keep great in game information on my screen, but I feel like I'm starting as a noob all over again
---
hey guys, just posted a video about the current discussion regarding rp-pvp servers. I think we can definitely get a change to the blizz policy here, just as we have for previous issues. If you have strong feelings on the topic, please do vote in the poll here:  [https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-what-many-are-trying-to-achieve-is-getting-an-rp-pvp-server-when-wow-classic-releases?expired\_session=true](https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-what-many-are-trying-to-achieve-is-getting-an-rp-pvp-server-when-wow-classic-releases?expired_session=true) 
---
If you really never played alliance in vanilla before it would be a shame not to roll it. There will be plenty of nostalgia playing shared zones, dungeons etc. Alliance has some of the best quest lines in vanilla and is great for exploring  the intricacies of nilla. I wish I could roll on a new side of the story now, definitely don't skip that option!
---
I usually put buyout just above starting bid. The goal is quick turnaround. Long auctions with high buyouts will get undercut. 
---
Aye it’s a timed thing before you wipe. As for the gearing, in my experience the rogue needs to be T2 gear and the Druid just needs to be decently geared with blues and some purps. The thing is you can also just buy AH pieces with +arcane damage on them and those are probably your best pieces for this bursty fight for you. Rogue needs a lot of FAPs. 
---
Make sure to check out Stranglethorn Vietnam!
---
The Bfa ones?
---
Oof, I wanne disagree with that.
---
I won‘t mind some updates and refurbishment, but I really don‘t want it to look like bfa at all.
---
Classic had a special artstyle, which will be affected by that.
---
I also think they're goofy, but the old models are SO low-res it's almost unbearable. And also for the critters and mobs and stuff, it could give the vanilla experience a fresh look without changing anything to how the game played, and it's also completely up to the players, so to each their own.
---
Is there maybe a way we could set up a fluff filter for this sub (like how worldnews lets you filter out Israel/Palestine or Trump news)?
---
I do enjoy a lot of these screenshots and art and memes and stuff, but sometimes I just want to skip straight to serious discussion..
---
Thanks for reminding me of this song! Holy s\*\*\*balls the nostalgia feels. My troll rogue in arathi highlands with this on full blast! Those were the days!
---
Played on Defias a bit on vanilla and all of tbc. Had some amazing RP!
---
Whats with the “No Change/No Extra Content” circlejerk?
---
Like after Naxx, the games gonna be stuck with no content for years. 
---
I think these No Change circlejerkers are just are blatantly ignorant like flat earthers/anti vaxxers, they dont see logic where it fits. 
---
Really?  I haven't played retail since wrath so I have no idea.
---
I puked
---
Play a stealth class
---
Play a rogue, stealth to avoid engaging.
---
I already have an addon, that lets me accept quests even with non-instant quest text, made up for the Classic API that was on the demo - just waiting for them to enable addons.
---
I'd say the best spec. With a ret pali and other palis down ranking judgments of the crusader you would do insane damage. Only downside no crit modifiers and no hit talents
---
True, but I assume he's talking about outside of dungeons.  I remember getting random trade requests from people nearby and then a whisper asking for food and water.  Many people just assume that as a mage, you constantly have a full bag of conjured goods to hand out.
---
Yes it’s possible to tank without being deep prot. However for 50/60 I highly recommend you get the additional threat talent in the protection tree
---
Why does engineering help as a tank? Does dynamite help with threat? For some reason I thought damage from items was treated differently from ability damage and didn't get a threat boost. But it has been nearly 15 years. 
---
we havnt won till i login and there is no mount or wow token cash shop
---
Yeah Ion basically said that RP-PvP were too niche and they didn't think they would be doing a server for it.
---
Amen! Crossing my fingers we'll get an update about this soon.
---
Depending on where you are in the pack of levellers I imagine there won't be much pvp in the beginning of the game. (The faster you level the less pvp you will se). Pvping will lose you levelling time eaven if you win. And there will be no twinks and almost no ppl at higher level
---
So much Warlock post, is everyone going to roll Warlock :o ?
---
One spec i would like to try is duel wield mace stun warrior. Obviously for pvp. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LAGxzhbVZZxbts0hzo
---
If you're fighting another warlock, you'll have your felhunter out, which gives you spell resistance, Devour Magic on an 8 second cool down that you can use to try to dispel fear from yourself and Spell Lock on a (I think) 30 second cool down if you want to interrupt the fear.  Also, warlock pvp trinkets can break fear, charm, and sheep.
---
On the other hand, as a lock you have no way to get out of a *physical* stun (you can dispel magic stuns like HoJ), so the 25% chance to resist stuns as an orc is huge.  Suppose a rogue is trying to stun lock you, so they open with Cheap Shot then get 5 combo points and use Kidney Shot.  As an Orc, because of your racial you'll resist one of the two stuns about 37% of the time, you'll resist *both stuns* about 6% of the time, and you'll be stunned by both only around 56% of the time.
---
In a lock vs lock fight, the skill and gear level is going to decide who wins.  In a lock vs rogue fight, getting a lucky stun resist can be the difference between winning and losing, and even though it's rng, the 1 in 16 chance to resist a full 10 seconds of stun lock can be insane.
---
That said, I think locks have the best looking sets in game, so I would only ever play as a race where I can appreciate the look and imo, undead &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orc for aesthetics as a caster.
---
wow this is quite the list!
---
Tuesday’s were the bane of my summer vacation. I’d typically end up playing the WCIII campaigns or customs matches to pass the time tho.
---
There are some of them that joined the Argent Dawn right?
---
I believe you're talking about Asmongold, he made a video about it.
---
Paladins are considered the best PvE healers in Classic
---
ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOOO
---
BGs Guitarist was a wow gamer himself :)
---
I always used to play on RP-PvE, beause the general quality of players was better than 'Normal' servers and I wasn't a fan of PvP.
---
The only thing I've enjoyed in BfA is War Mode, and I want to roll on PvP in classic, so RP-PvP is the perfect niche for me.
---
If you see some of the recent polls you would allmost believe it. 
---
There goes the "free" raid spot :p
---
Just the thumbnail alone tells me its Illegal danish super snack, that movie was so fucking good. ARCANITE REAPER!!! HOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Don't pick rogue like the other guys are suggesting. You get farmed if you get caught out. What you should do is stick with your buddies and level together. Strength in numbers. People won't try to gank you guys and if they do, they'll lose unless they are a 4-5man aswell.
---
TLDR: Choose what you want and level with your buddies.
---
&gt;Additionally, I hope Blizzard release the names of the servers soon, so we can start deciding where we want to go.
---
I just want to avoid the terrible streamer servers, I can't imagine anyone above the age of 18 wanting to see their entire server become about a streamer in every chat
---
Biggest thing about no change is we’ll get there when we get there. If we say, ya let’s go straight into BC who knows how fast that is. Maybe as a community we want to do BC years later or maybe a completely new server. At least that’s how I’ve seen others put it and I agree. This is a classic server not a progression server.
---
Man that old Outlands exploration Movie was awesome!Had some great music :)
---
If someone got a name I'd be grateful :)
---
Dinged 60 listening to Asia - Heat of the moment
---
Maybe you are misremembering when? I know in wotlk hots stacked. When did that change? Burning crusade? I don’t know. 
---
Couldn't speak for before Wrath, I wasn't on that server until then! But yeah, it was a great server until it sorta died out.
---
You gonna raid and get bene? 
---
They are cringey af and pretty badly written songs tbh.
---
Nothing is worth that grind to 14 unless they change it.
---
&gt;You get farmed if you get caught out.
---
lol no
---
get good and learn how to res
---
I mean, at AQ40 all r14 weapons become obsolete. Most of them even during BWL.
---
Mana is not really limited, since I don't need mana to kill stuff.
---
It's really not that big of a deal. You people pretend like mass reporters are just going around for fun to mute people. 
---
Not to mention the larger spell batch windows will likely help with performance as well.
---
So many soulstones
---
Aiming for rank 14 is like saying goodbye to your life, but if you care about the "reputation" you'll get from being THE Grand Marshall go for it, imo the weapon is not that good as a counterpart for loosing all touch with the real world
---
I don't actually believe there is a straight answer for your question, because it's subjective to how long you're willing to wait for your profit. If you're willing to wait for the Auction to run it's full length with no buyout option you could potentially get more money, just less immediate gain.
---
There are 7 computers in my home. 0 optical drives.
---
This was an event orchestrated by the guy himself.
---
Deciding between raiding and pvp, to be honest. Benediction was one of those items I carried with me as we sadly moved farther and farther away from vanilla and for nostalgias sake I’m sure I’d try and acquire it again some day. 
---
Holy shit, Grand Marshal Nineteen???? Roc, night elf rogue here.
---
But....the epeen. What about that sweet sweet epeen?
---
As a rogue, I can't use a sword or mace in my offhand ? only daggers?
---
Then 60% of the time would be spent playing a shittier game :D I'm all for resetting the servers though.
---
I'll never forget winning Ardent Custodian on a greed roll in RFK.  The value of a mid 30s one hand defensive mace was immense /s
---
I suppose I’m at a crossroads between deciding if I want to commit to raiding or pvping full time 
---
You can also enable pvp on pve right? What is the difference anyways? 
---
You're correct! The graph seems to be giving a lot of people trouble, so my job today is to have it in a manner that is more easily understandable.
---
As for your conclusion on the prioritization of low rage executes, you're absolutely right. Execute damage efficiency is lower the more rage you have - that's why you always want to Execute as soon as you can and not pool rage, and also why Execute switching is so good as it enables you to maximize your rage allocation.
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
Yes, your offhand can wield any weapon a rogue can use.
---
THE Grand Marshall honestly does sound quite appealing, and it’s hard to say why. I think it’s just such a vastly different kind of achievement than what’s available in current retail and that intrigues me. 
---
I mean in general. WoW didn't even exist.
---
Aug 1
---
I think the generally agreed-upon preference is to just release new classic servers so people can start over again.
---
One of my biggest issues with D&amp;D for the longest time was trying to min max. I never enjoyed played with friends more than when I immersed myself in the character. I might try to do the same this go around. Planning on playing mage. Might let my DM roll some d20s with me and our group could decide our fates this way. 
---
? It's always been bannable to alter textures, and for good reason. You could make, for example, the flag in way mega huge, so you could always see it. Or other similar stuff that gives an unfair advantage. Guilds have been banned for modified textures in the past, even vanilla.
---
The way I see it, from when they would announce TBC being a thing to when it would release, I would have time to level one, I don’t want to play hunter or warlock in vanilla even though I’d play them in tbc, so I don’t want to take away from my vanilla experience to try and bet on tbc
---
If you are playing alone at any given time, try grinding or questing in a zone you're slightly out leveled for. This will often give you 2-4 levels advantage, or more, on enemy players, making it much less likely you'll be engaged.
---
I mean, the guy didn"t have any GM bribed, did he?
---
I really want to play a priest, as it was my main back in vanilla, but I remember constantly being broke. It was easy finding dungeon groups, but I remember it being really hard to make any money. You can’t farm, and even gathering profs are a pain, especially on a pvp server. 
---
I also spent a lot of money speccing back and forth between shadow and holy. It felt like I had to be shadow to do any solo content.
---
Is it as bad as I remember it?
---
I want to downvote this so much but I know it's not your fault 
---
Well, we're going to be playong classic, not retail. On retail, there is no real difference between PvP and PvE servers, so there was no reason to choose PvP realms over PvE realms. On Classic it could be completely different. Also RpPvP servers were massively disadvantaged due to being released later than regular Rp servers during Classic.
---
God...I haven’t felt this much pain from a shitty idea since I watched The Last Jedi 🤮🤮

Go for it...!!

Comparing a video game opinion with flat earthers? Give your head a shake dude. 
---
This. A lot of dps coming from retail and not having played vanilla will have problems. Hate generation was a bigger issue back then, with things like Feint and Fade needing to be used. Even healers would pull hate.
---
Agreed
---
They lose literally nothing by doing this 
---
I want to play on a rp realm and I want to engage in world pvp, I'd be disappointed if I couldn't do this both at once. 
---
Just give us one rp pvp realm, it wouldn't make sense if they don't. 
---
cringe
---
Your offhand can wear the same as your main-hand unless its a weapon that say "offhand" or "mainhand" only.. that means that specific weapon is slot-bound. 
---
Yeah i'm feeling the same, the title in this style like scarab lord or the undying are just a proof of how much you commited into the game and when you saw someone with it it was so impressive, nowadays just go down ragna and you'll be the firelord it takes you 15mn and you're done
---
“Thy ICC be done?” I believe I may be at the wrong church...
---
Reason iirc was their data showing those servers were dead the quickest and had to be merged. It is sadly far from a given that we are getting one, which is genuine shame if so.

---
you aren't getting r14 sorry
---
Ah, fair point. I suspect it’s what a lot of ppl plan all the same
---
No change doesnt necessarily mean "no more content post naxx". 
---
No change is in regards to the game we know, and it actually being the game we know and not a modded version of it. 
---
As for content past that, its a way deeper discussion than "it will just stop. Its illogical to not want more content past naxx!".
---
Also the comparison to flat earthers/anti vaxxers is quite damn bad I gotta say haha.
---
you talk about it like its easy to get and you can do it if you want
---
that isn't how it is
---
&gt;Hunters are a top tier dps class with literally only one button
---
I'm sorry to tell you but if you think a hunter is a one button class then you're absolutely mistaken. TBC Hunter was actually quite difficult because we still had auto-shot clipping. I'm been a Hunter from Classic throughout WotLK and I've been one of those theory-crafter you've read numerous blogs about (if you were a serious hunter back in the days). While you could certainly do well by playing wrong, it's been far from an easy thing to achieve proper rankings. 
---
However, what makes Hunter truly awesome in the TBC sense is that all specialisations have had their viable moments throughout the patches of TBC. I loved starting out as BM to be able to surpass it with MM only to switch to SV for Black Temple onwards and back to MM on Sunwell. This constant changing is what made the hunter the most memorable to me from that time.
---
Not really
---
Oh yeah they’re done for buddy. 
---
Classic is being built off the patch 7.1.5 engine, so I'd assume most graphical options will be similar to that patch.
---
You are... entirely stupid
---
There's no Alliance equivalent. The Barrens is huge, has way more leveling content than any other zone in the game, has three dungeons, and is the default zone for three of the four horde races to level in from level 10+. It's huge population is the reason why chat devolves into typical Barrens Chat shenanigans.
---
Use an addon like Auctioneer and keep scanning the auction house - once it's built up a good history you'll make a lot of profit.
---
come back at me when they get AOE healing spells
---
sounds like diablo 3 with old tristram event holy shit i would puke if that was real
---
Nope
---
I genuine hate RPers with passion and consider them second rate gamers.
---
That being said, they still deserve their own realm. 
---
Best one so far. Everything about this picture is rad
---
Yep.  I was in the top raiding guild there at server launch and I have so many great memories.   The world PVP, the RP guilds and events, AQ gate opening...
---
Oh, and I also happened to meet my wife there on one fateful day on a scarlet monastery PUG.
---
ED changed my life man.
---
Technically he he said nitch not niche xD 
---
Paladins can, albeit on the slower side, but being demon helps.
---
+ For RP-PVP servers. Can't imagine not being able to play on one. Just one single server would do.
---
That and a Mountain Dew for all your gaming needs 
---
Sorry to hear that but that’s for the support anyways! Do you usually play PvE or PvP and how “hardcore” do you consider yourself? 
---
I am aware that even a want of it and a commitment to 50-60+ hours a week past rank 10 with the help of a pvp guild and premades doesn’t guarantee anything. I guess I’m just trying to put myself in the right mindset as far as where and when and even if to begin the excruciating grind. 
---
Yeah im waiting to re-live that moment I had with first 10lvls in open beta
---
Those flatscreens must have cost a fortune.
---
Any pvper serious about it needs to raid at some point in classic. Depending on class/spec, a lot of great gear drops in raids. As a healer you can join a casual guild that will accept you healing without changing your pvp spec. Just make sure you have some good pre-raid gear. 
---
If you’re lucky and the guild has loads of warlocks you might even dps thanks to the priest shadow dmg increase debuff.
---
Nah, they just got Goldshire.
---
Benediction / anathema are pretty damn close to R14 weps
---
This is probably entirely true, but those people did have to make that decision at some point to go for it and set aside whatever resources necessary. After all, classic isn’t even out yet. 
---
June 26th is my assumed date of release, it's few days after summer break starts for schools and a perfect time for release.
---
Jesus man how long did it take you make this?
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. 
---
LFG Hogger
---
It isn't authentic vanilla unless I have to go to Walmart at around 3 hours before release, stand in line for that long, giddily rush home blaring music loudly, and stay up all night playing it with my friends after we all get home at the same time. 
---
I present to you John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.

---
The audience density of most Alliance zones is by default, small in relativity to the Barrens, which greatly reduces the important reaction process of creating the Internet Fuckwad. It's not to say it can't happen, such as in certain condensed cases of Goldshire, but that's more the exception than the rule.
---
The kettle boils faster when on top of the already struggling case fan. 
---
It's mostly the same honestly. 
---
The difference is having PVP always enabled adds to the immersion. It makes the world dangerous and interactive. On PVE servers you could be out in the world and someone from the opposite faction runs up to you, who isn't flagged for PVP, jumping all around and taunting you and there is nothing you can do. It totally ruins the experience and immersion. It's very anti-RP.
---
\#NOCHANGES
---
Yeah I would hope there is atleast one. I never knew they were so unpopular, especially because I remember EU had "Defias Brotherhood" or some server near that name that was usually always full. I can imagine the less popular ones dropping but I cant imagine that there isnt enough people to fully support one for a long long time.
---
I feel like people want the game as it was and then we can talk about where to go from there. 1.12 has enough content that most players won't even likely finish. Only the hardcore crowd would really get far enough to say theyve done it all and want more. I would personally like the OSRS approach to community polling on what content to add.
---
bro thats kinda cringe
---
But your healer needs mana to keep you alive.
---
i know man im just repeating that guy's ridicilous question and applying it to a slightly different situation.
---
savory deviate delight
---
Westfall chat was pretty derp. 
---
I just want to be a Tauren Druid and not look horrible in cat form. The WotLK model would do it for me...
---
Like seasons in D3 or leagues in PoE? 
---
Stay out of our city, cow!
---
This is what I don't understand. Why wouldn't they include at least one? It's like limiting our access to certain aspects of the game. I want to have all content available personally.
---
Cold Mountain Dew in hand, anything was possible...in the world...of Warcraft 
---
Agreed, but correctly so. Nothing need be said as a conclusion there, it speaks for itself.
---
making it to thaddius with the mp5 coghammer from mc, some people really were carried back then and nobody knew
---
*"Accounts who were first created during 2004/2005 will be eligible to play Classic first, starting on June 1st."*
---
I mean, 99% of the game companies try to exploit early access anyway...
---
It's not just about that though. If you go on a RP server you don't have access to World PVP the same because people have to flag as hostile, which breaks immersion. If you go on a PVP server......your not able to RP properly because it's not a committed environment for it and you end up getting trolled etc as a result.
---
I am a 20 year old woman and i've always been in the Horde. Most of my friends are men tho...
---
Girls play alliance because they have pretty races. Source: gf picked human female. 
---
add a wyvern string on top and fear a beast. congratulations you've crowd controlled 4 targets.
---
&gt; I do wonder why so many people here want the new models. Anybody mind explaining why they prefer them?
---
It's like you're asking for someone to explain why they like rap music, it's personal preference. It isn't really any more complicated than that.
---
Damn. Do you know if you can do everything in this spec? Like heal dungeon/raid and maybe tank dungeons? That would be pretty legit
---
Ah, missed that part. Apologies. 
---
Yeah. Many people aren't playing classic to go through all the expansions again. They're playing classic because they like classic. 
---
Someone leaves the guild and the whole guild report bans him. No way this is going to get abused.
---
cool. reminds me of a crystal cave on the mountains of mulgore i wall jumped to in vanilla. they got rid of it in cataclysm unforunately
---
also do you know what the red area is in the middle of the ocean in the eastern kingdoms map? in the southwest of the image
---
Night elf hunter was my original as well as my first to 60.  Ended up sidelining him except for PVP to play dwarf paladin and gnome mage.
---
This is probably the closest thing. 10-20 zone where most alliance come to level.  I typically travel across continents when I play night elf just to level in West fall/duskwood 
---
maybe but it sure as shit wont be until lvl 20. 
---
&gt;Pog
---
keep yourself safe for speaking like this
---
Druid solo anything is a waste of time if the goal is to earn gold. Better off grouping up to twoman DM:East jumpruns, tank strat live for orbs, heal strat life for orbs or run around and herb.
---
I was thinking of doing the first combo with my warrior. Is that a stupid idea?
---
As far as I know the API will be based on the 7.3.5 (Legion) API. Things like /script-macros won't work as they did in 1.12 and devs will have to rework their addons.
---
My guess is that it'll take some time at release for all the usual addons to be released, especially the ones currently only available for 1.12, as they probably require the most rewriting.
---
I for one just hope that "SmartPet" will be available :D
---
best class for rogue on either faction
---
the only reason i'm wary of new models as an option is that when blizzard did the option for both in their main game, they totally mangled the old models and apparently fixing it wasn't an option because they then proceeded to remove old model option. if they can avoid that, i'm all for it
---
Friendly reminder: There never were cartels of this nature in Vanilla and there won't be in classic.
---
Since there are no diminishing returns, Druids are great at farming devilsaur. I did it as well just to mix things up in farming.
---
I love it.  I made some conditional formatting rules to show whether a class was Alliance (Blue), Horde (Red), Class (Yellow), Everyone (Green), anything else plain.  It makes it much easier to identify which quests are available to you.
---
The main problem I have is that the HD variants of several character options look completely different than their low-rez counterparts… when the new models came out I had to re-customize a ton of my characters just so they didn’t look like crap. In Vanilla there’s no barbershop, meaning that if I design my character to look good with low-rez options, it’s going to look like crap to everybody with HD models turned on. I’ll have no choice but to design for HD even if I don’t want to use HD models myself.
---
One of the biggest examples of this that comes to mind are a couple of female gnome faces where the originals look fine but the HD versions have massive bags under their eyes and have their mascara smeared all over.
---
Many will reroll when they get constantly passed up for 5-mans.
---
I've seen groups take 2 rogues before taking 2 warlocks, and rogues were waaaay more common back then. Many like to think that warlocks are comparable to mages, but decurse is so huge that not only will groups pick mage over warlock, they will also pick druid over warlock.
---
Once you get vanish you'll do fine as a rogue but druid would be a better choice if you're playing a class just to avoid PVP.
---
Np man, cheers.
---
I sure hope so and people not wanting better graphic makes my head hurts. 2004 graphic look like fucking ass. 
---
Completely agree dude. Modern WoW graphics, models and animations are honestly below trash. I haven’t even bought Legion and BFA for the sole reason of how repulsed I am by the graphics. Everyone I know agrees. So weird how this “vanilla” subreddit is always so pro-modern WoW whenever a chance arises.
---
I used RMarkdown, which does use Latex in the backend! Good eye :)
---
This is incredible dude! Ever thought about adding coordinates to the list?
---
Huh I never thought of it before, but how is purchasing gonna work? I bought WoW during vanilla am I gonna need a new copy? Or is it just gonna cost the monthly fee?
---
I actually have plans on making something like you describe here. I've been playing on a private server lately and doing PUGs instead of guild runs since it's hard for me to commit to a raiding schedule. After doing a decent amount of PUGs you end up being member of a bunch of discords and it gets easier to find raids, but I do think it would be nice with a website where you could have an overview of PUGs on your server and the possibility to signup. And of course it would work just as good for other dungeons and quests as well. I don't really want to make and add-on to automate the process further, because I want this to just be a tool outside wow and not like a in game group finder replacement.
---
Since a lot of us have a more busy life now than when we played vanilla, it would be nice if you know you have 2 hours a certain night that you can host or join a group/raid beforehand instead of wasting your time to find that tank or healer but instead can sit at work and get your group filled up.
---
&gt;  (I mained a mage and I really began to despise the huge number of people begging for food since they never learned to cook)
---
as someone with 130+days played on a mage main, this is absolutely absurd
---
though i know we had a lot of odd behavior back in the day - remember meeting a Hunter who refused to Trap in dungeons because they didn't trust them anymore... was kind of like meeting someone with PTSD and wouldn't get in a car anymore
---
Mage is listed as a playable class for dwarves
---
Show us your CRT monitor for the first.
---
Yea, there was a small window where you had to go out to queue up. BGs came out in 1.5 right? so it didn't take long for them to change that. 
---
Ty that helps alot!
---
Bene is a really amazing weapon and it looks super cool. But you are going to want to get R13 for all the armor right? How much more work is the last step to you. Will you benefit yes, is it a must? No. Will your E-peen grow 5 sizes with the R14 under your belt? Yes. However, either way you are gonna get bene. MC is a joke and every priest is gonna have access to it which will make your pvp journey easier. And you seem like you’ll have the time, what else are you gonna do? Level an alt like a sucker? No, why do that when you could spend all that time in AB? You know you are gonna get R14 like a boss. Then buy the weapons and say... “I like bene more” then go womp some more alliance ass in AV. 
---
For the horde!! 
---
NotLikeThis BibleThump
---
I don't see why one faction would have more than the other. I could easily make the argument that Alliance has more neckbeards because it has the pretty waifu races
---
Horde is the same as Alliance (I played as a hordie for more than 6 years and later changed factions to Alliance). The only difference is that PvE servers tend to be more populated on the Alliance side (that's why I had to change factions).
---
It’s not classic.

im pretty sure anyone was able to roll on anything. a priest rolling need on a 2h sword is a ninja.

keep yourself safe

unconfirmed how many players per server but it should only be 2500 per. it wont be too bad securing a name.
---
what are the basic points of speed leveling? 
---
does it really boil down to " never don't be killing a mob"? quests are optional? what level (+/- of your own level) should you be grinding?

Are school kids still the target audience for this? I might be wrong since I haven't played a lot on private servers, but aren't most people excited for classic people that are now in their mid 20s to 30s?
---
Tfw you skipped school only to find out about patch day.
---
Meh pack shards and you will be good peopel are lazy and a free sum wont easly be passed on
---
The times as a lock I had to wait on the other  to come over and help sum is stupidly high :p.
---
But its true the more locks the less beneficial they are in dungeoun content but this holds true for most classes, bit of everything is preffered as it the spice of life variation.
---
Pffft 3 hours, what is this amateur hour? Gotta be the first in line.
---
Everyone is debating whether it is good or not, but if you are for #nochanges, then the way forward is very clear, isn't it? It wasn't in classic and should not be in classic now.
---
Stay out nelf scum. Westfall is for humans.
---
rather see more vanilla content that they wanted to release back then. TBC was my most memorable time in WoW but   id rather them not. Expansions were a bad idea in the first place, nothing epic about 10 lvls just to raid log and arena.
---
I had to do like 4 double takes to make sure that wasn't me or my friends back in college. We used to crowd around the one guy that was in the alpha watch him. Or just drink and take turns playing the classes available at the time. 
---
Nema na cemu, mozda se vidimo u igri:) 
---
The few females that play WoW mostly gravitate towards PvE servers and Alliance races.  So yeah, expect a lot of peen.
---
It's just the subscription, you will most likely (read: for sure) download it on bnet.
---
Youre on crack. A druid over a warlock makes no sense. One is a healer, one is dps/utility. 
---
also, maybe they took 2 rogues because as you just said, they were way more common......
---
You need decurse for like one 5 man instance, undead strat. Youre over exaggerating a n00b
---
13-17
---
I'm betting they announce that they're adding LFG into classic for April fools
---
It's bundled with the normal fee as far as I know. It's downloadable through the Launcher I would assume.
---
Ally scum
---
Do you guys remember the old interactive Azeroth map on the website back in the day? It ran on Flash and it had the level ranges of every zone for you to click on. Wayback Machine has the original site but not the Flash content like the vanilla PvP rewards page which I miss.
---
&gt; It isn't really any more complicated than that.
---
I mean it sort of is. I gave my reasons as to why I don't like them. I'd like to hear why someone'd disagree with that, and additionally, what positive features draw them to the new models. You can for example say "I like rap because the way rhythm is a part of the music makes me feel good" or something along those lines.
---
What about implementation of the new models/effects  from retail? 
---
You dont joke about Classic’s release date... You just dont 😆
---
Useless no, annoying yes.
---
We going back to Kalimdor!
---
No, but he had a (full) raid of ppl reporting him on his command. 
---
Druid is arguably the fastest leveler and bears are the best 5 man tanks so you can get a group quick.
---
I respect that you can play WoW 100+ hours a week without work getting in the way, but it's not for me. 
---
Yea you got it right mostly, but quests are very important, since they lead you between grinding mobs you benefit from via the quests as well.
---
* all mobs are full of XP, kill all mobs in your patch (at least until you get your mount)
---
The quest direction generally brings you into a region where the mobs are useful both for grinding XP but also for the quest drop/slay requirements, or ones guarding an item or altar, etc. Making the mobs sometimes Green and sometimes Yellow but very rarely being Orange and never being Grey. Key being the lack of downtime while also gaining XP during each mob on the way to-and-from the quest hub.
---
Well we're not getting logic back in our macros, that's never going to happen. You just have to make sure not to press the macro twice.
---
Overall it's a huge net win, having the ability to write entire addons in macros was a huge flaw.
---
My pleasure, I spent like 2 hours today with this, totally worth it
---
Horde is cool i never played alliance. back in vanilla i played hunter now in classic i will play shadow priest.
---
same for me a different game. but i dont switch faction.
---
your idea to enjoy the game is the right choice 
---
higher resolutions are more punishing on GPU, and eases up on CPU
---
I am the healer lol.
---
This is blasphemous!
---
Haha those are my memories too. I'd spec back and forth at least once a week, sometimes twice if I had the gold. I remember being broke too but also remember it not being too hard to farm 100g as shadow. I had a spot up in Everlook with yetis that was fast. But I was on a PvE server so my experience might have been different.
---
This time around I think I might try and find a hybrid spec that would allow me to have fun in PvP and also be strong in PvE. Until, of course, I'm tired of compromising and want to go full shadow again &gt;:D
---
That would actually really screw me over. LOL
---
When this goes to manual review by a GM that multiboxer will be banned to pieces since it's probably not the first time he's done it.
---
“Best of all, it will be a specially zoned instance that is only playable on your phone.”
---
They don't really ban for that sort of thing. People on the WoW general are posting with all manner of (usually lewd) mods constantly. It's certainly in the TOS that it's bannable, but blizzard clearly doesn't give a fuck. 
---
So a big part of it is knowing what quests are worth it and what quests you can ignore because they'll have you spend more time running around than grinding?
---
Ha I had those headphones, they we're garbage.
---
There are consequences for organized false reports though. A guild doing that to someone who leaves would result in the entire guild getting banned once manual review is done by a GM, I don't think it's worth it.
---
If they did that I wouldn't even be mad
---
Could you give an overview of what this guild plans to do before I click on your Discord? 
---
Just a mention...  while fishing for the deviate fish u will undoubtedly catch a few perfect deviate scales.  These are the mat for a very sought after lvl19 twink belt.  Do not vendor!!! 
---
Seems to be similar to how Warriors talent "Blood Frenzy" works which is in the Fury tree, and isn't technically a cast spell but a proc.
---
I maimed hunter in tbc in a sunwell clearing guild but OK.
---
You think you don't, but you do.
---
boy wants that pussy YEET
---
make azeroth great again!
---
Maybe some took it far but I was more surprised to meet woman who played games. Young and the gaming scene was very very different back then. 
---
If it was something I did inappropriately do you think I would come into Reddit to announce it?
---
Most women who play horde are fat. Most woman who play alliance are actually male.
---
16th july, the tinfoil is strong in this one. 
---
The internal faction conflict of alliance is why I play horde 
---
We would like to cover as many aspects of the game as possible, PvP and PvE included. We still haven't decided on a main server yet, its up for vote. So joining earlier rather than later will allow you to have some sort of input on what direction you would like to move in. If you end up joining the discord you can ask more questions there to the Guild Leader directly, we do have a questions tab for that as well as some links to solid accessible resources most people should look at before playing classic, considering it is essentially a completely different game.
---
depends, if you are a magic class I wouldnt bother trying to kill a felhunter cause high magic resist. 
---
I think it would only make sense for a mage to sheep the warlock, kill the pet. But as a long time lock player no one does this.
---
If youre a rogue for sure you can sap the lock, kill the pet.
---
sometimes my pet would die from warriors aoe strikes but they didnt focus is usually.
---
Someone posted the complete list of banned names a couple days ago. Too lazy to look it up do it yourself
---
Raiding until i get a full set of T3. Let the long journey begin. 
---
Seems like there's a shift towards Warlock amongst experienced/hardcore players (vs back when Vanilla was around), but I'm sure the class makeup of the average player will be similar to what you'd expect.
---
Just seems like now there's more knowledge about the game, the more hardcore players want to play classes with either more nuance/build options, and/or that are clearly "the best" at their role.
---
Rather than choosing purely on aesthetic/flavour/'fun' reasons like you average person does.
---
I don't play retail, but just found out that apparently you can still hide your helm and cloak, but you have to talk to some transmog NPC or whatever.
---
no matter how much time you take off from work you will never reach rank 14. rank 14 requires 16hours of pvp all day every day for months
---
What PvE content would you feel comfortable healing as a hybrid? Do you think you could do MC?
---
I really hope blizzard staff see this because it's absolutely true.
---
British or Australian? 
---
No worries! I agree with ya.
---
This response is appreciated more than you know. I appreciate your positivity and encouragement and your upbeat outlook. Like many things in life, the journey might be absolute hell, but with traveling to hell and back comes the badge of honor having done it. Thank you, my friend.

Can anybody tell me about that place on the east coast of Arathi Highlands? Looks like some kind of pier?

UK mate
---
I disagree, I played on similar sized servers to you, Rebirth and Nostalrius.
---
On nostalrius it was international, there was english speakers(US and parts of Europe), chinese, and russians for the major populations.
---
You stick to your own kind. I 100% would run into people I saw all the time. With these large populations too we wouldnt need cross realm battlegrounds. I think its way more fun to run into people you see in your server in BGs, rather than some random guy with a -server name at the end you wont see again.
---
Ah. In that case, first aid helps your group keep active in case you're low on mana, but the DPS isn't. Ideally, the DPS would first aid themselves, but I don't like trusting non-healers to not be idiots...
---
Only for the weeks/months necessary to grind the rank hah, trust me when I say I’ll have to make some sacrifices to do it. And I think that’s just it for me...it’s the feeling of being among so few who are able and willing to do so that makes it worth it. 
---
The game came out in late '04 and early '05 in Europe. I have no idea why so many people refer to Vanilla as '04.
---
28 female Horde player. I've met awesome dudes on horde side and we are irl friends to this day.I tried to play alliance once and it wasnt very pleasant experience in groups.
---
NOTE: The "OMG girl in wow" meme attitude doesnt play a role since I always play male undeads.
---
So no white-knighting or acting you know ...like neckbeards.
---
I'd recommend a Druid over a Rogue since you also have heals, travel and aquatic forms, and ability to escape roots and polymorph.
---
I wouldn't call that "getting the magic back", but "correcting old mistakes" instead.
---
I think everyone, that has played previously, will be doing the same. Come on, most of us didn't read quest texts, skipped most group content at leveling, and never made got any item from raids.
---
Intentional server crashes and five hour queues for an authentic launch experience.
---
Were the battle ground holiday weekends Fri-Mon inclusive? 
---
Or were they just for the Saturday and Sunday? 
---
What was the advantage for playing those battlegrounds on those weekends? 
---
"Won the figh" oh boy... fight against whom? Blizzard?
---
Blizzard has just come to the conclusion that releasing WoW Classic will make them so much money that it's actually worth the effort of running essentially a second MMO. They never fought against Classic, they just didn't deem it a profitable investment until recently. Classic will either fail or it will succeed... in which case Blizzard makes a lot of money from Classic subscribers so in the end they win. 
---
Hey u/gael_the_druid why are you trying to spoil April Fool's Day, HUH!?
---
I need to find a Rule #9 to ban this post before you spoil my fun...
---
Actually it is, just dont click the little box in the options and bam! It's all good for everyone.
---
But alas, there is one among us each week who will achieve it. 
---
I signed and spread that petition! Hail Nostalrius!
---
Hence why I said I was free to farm devilsaur leather solo.
---
I only learned about devilsaur mafias a decade later in private server land.
---
Man that spread sheet has a great layout. Any clue if there is a warrior and mage version floating around?
---
That's a part, yea. 
---
I remember the first time I leveled a character strictly to a leveling guide and there are moments when you think "really.. do this?" and then a couple levels later you realize just how much time you saved by getting that FP randomly or skipping through a zone just to get one quest item before doing another thing where in reward you sometimes turn in like 8 quests at once. Grinding is real useful but mostly as a means to get someplace while gaining XP - before you get a mount anyway. 
---
And if you're a Skinner, killing all mobs makes even more sense $$$
---
you'll get banned as a prank
---
PLEASE be 26/06 release. That's my birthday.
---
Die heathen! 
---
Absolutely! People claiming otherwise are simply wrong, the Alliance equivalent was Goldshire, more of a /s congregation than a zone chat, better in my opinion.
---
You've got to put a foot down and set a general direction.  What's half your members to do when PvE servers are a deal breaker?  You're creating potential divisions and drama that will likely destroy your guild before it even gets off the ground.  You should decide on some objectives, regroup, and pitch be idea again at a later time.  You can't be the guild that does everything with no foundation.
---
Just my two cents.
---
In PVE, melee is generally more engaging than ranged. Casters have very simple rotations, especially while raiding. Hunters have depth though.
---
Aside from the obvious, this also reminds me of Willie Wonka.
---
I keep mine in a shoe box in the attic for these special moments. 
---
from *unholy* undead dk to *holy* undead priest.
---
We have a few months to decide on anything, if what we ends of deciding on doesn't tickle your fancy, you can leave. No drama needed, and wont really be tolerated. 
---
;_;
---
&gt; I'm glad the game I experienced back then was the entire package all at once (wink) instead of partially spoiling it. 
---
The innuendo aside, that's way too mature a view, I was fourteen back then and would have eaten asshole lasagna for just the first starting area. 
---
You really can't?  You don't even want to take a crack at it there chief?

I’d be down to play TBC because I missed out on that as well 
---
I'm switching faction too (to alliance) but keeping the same class (rogue). 
---
I mostly just want to be NE really bad, as the entire time i was an UD, I wanted to be a NE. I didn't have the option because my friends were horde :( but I will this time!
---
It will be cool though to have different zones and quests to level in. 
---
I forgot that talk about "certain things" was against the rules.
---
I wouldn’t call your post ‘shit’ I would just call it ‘lame’ 
---
Try smthn new
---
How does a hunter solo tribute run and how much does gear or spec matter?
---
Thank you!
---
I’ve stated over and over again in this thread why you still can NOT compare WoW Classic to the Pservers.  I’ll run it down again for you. Pserver vets are not the only ones interested, and are not the only ones that will stay. Trying to draw a comparison between a very particular group of people and the entirety of the Classic WoW community just doesn’t work.  There are too many factors being left out, and and any conclusions taken from that are flawed.
---
OBLITERATED!
---
Thought about it, but unless someone knows the algorithm to accurately convert world coordinates to zone coordinates, I’m not going to try.  It’s not bad for people smack in the middle of goldshire, but for all the NPCs on the border, it gets wonky.  That’s why on classicdb people at Nijel’s point show up in Stonetalon.  
---
A lot of people started in 04, though I didn't get into it until fall of 05 because I was playing FFXI before
---
Imagine the arrogance of wanting people to pay twice to enjoy something because you don't like them.
---
I’ve never done RP in WoW but I’m interested in trying it. If I do, I’d much rather have an RP-PvP realm to do it on.
---
For me it was and is Durotar. It was my first starting zone, so obviously there's a bias at play, but I like the warm colours and soundtrack. But I don't really dislike any starting zone. I guess it depends on what you see in each. 
---
My rank order of Vanilla starting zones is:
---
1. Durotar
---
2. Elwynn forest - Trisifal Glades
---
3. Teldrassil
---
4. Mulgore
---
5. Dun Morogh
---
And if TBC Classic happens, then Eversong Woods would slightly beat out Durotar. Eversong is much more impressive and feel bigger, but again, nostalgia bias keeps Durator so high for me.
---
That's a no from me
---
A week-ish, hour or two a night.  
---
Is there a way to see enemy casting timers like add-ons allowed in TBC?
---
I want to kick spells right before they finish casting.
---
NO
---
Wow, you must be ~~fun~~ horrible at parties.
---
Can not be installed on a ssd for Speed authenticity 
---
Reddit is still upset that TLJ didn't play out like their fanfics? Lol 
---
Oh no pay twice for 2 different games.. How horrible 
---
Well 
---
Probably going to announce the Collectors Edition as a Blockbuster Exclusive.
---
I forgot how chilling and relaxing was playing during the night back in the day
---
Nice touch adding GM Island.
---
That's a hard pass from me and I don't even play bfa. Stupid decision all around.
---
For the reason given? Yeah. That is a problem. 
---
Choose your class based on what you like to play/want to try. Not whether or not they are strong in a particular gear phase. Well, that's just my advice. I've rolled enough characters in Vanilla to know that yields the most satisfactory experience.
---
They are the same game, just different versions of it...
---
What's your top 2?
---
Did anyone see the messenger???
---
In name only 
---
You have to realize that the multi boxer MAY get 2 or three people disconnected but he will then be put on a list for perm ban. People just dont do this very often and the 1% of cases is seemingly the only thing we are looking at here.
---
I haven’t kept up too much, am I still going to have to deal with a lvl 40 dwarf killing quest givers south of Thunder Bluff?  I Fucking hope so, I loved that shit. It took thirty of us to chase that fucker down and beat his short chubby ass. Then back to liking harpies in the hills and hoping for greens. I miss those days. 
---
It depends on the spec, but IMO real skill (and communication among the raid healers) overrides talent point optimization. So if you're good and trust your team and bring appropriate consumables/mana potions, then you should be fine with most hybrid specs through all but the hardest content.
---
The thing with priest talent trees is that they're not quite that fleshed out lol so at level 60 there can seem to be big variances in specs that are actually quite similar. It boils down to personal preference.
---
This one is very PvE heavy, but gives you lots of survivability and utility in PvP pre-mades.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAioobLthc
---
(key disc talent points here are improved mana burn, power infusion, improved inner fire, and mental agility for casting lots and lots of dispels. in holy tree, divine fury and improved healing are the key talents for gheal efficiency, which will let you excel in raids.)
---
this one is a new meta on the private server scene. because it include both improved mana burn and silence, you will be VERY useful in pvp groups; also, with spirit tap and mind flay, you'll be a better grinder. note that it would be easy to switch some of the shadow talent points around to get shadow weaving, if your guild wants to give their warlocks a DPS boost. i just don't care for shadow weaving unless it's a full shadow build.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsViZbZEMrzcz
---
of course, none of these specs are "damage dealing" specs. for that you will need to go full shadow, and either respec a lot, or learn to live with slightly sub-optimal healing spells. ask yourself before you respec to full holy before each raid: do you/does your guild/ really NEED you to be full holy to clear this content? 
---
This looks cozy as fuck
---
There are many stereotypes about the two factions, and they're 100% true 10% of the time.
---
Remember to degauss it.
---
*published on Feb 17, 2006*
---
bit more than that chief
---
So everyone does this different but I personally get INTO it hard core. I am Horde and you are Alliance. I will kill every single alliance I encounter. Imma damn axe wielding blood-slashing orc for Thrall’s sake. And I love PVP. 
---
Excellent guide, thanks for the resource!
---
Oh, for sure, defiance is one of the key reasons to go down the prot tree for PvE. When the OP said that he was considering a few points in prot though I didn't imagine he wanted to invest enough to get to defiance.
---
If he's interested in going all the way to defiance then that is great but it would somewhat hamstring (hehe) him in PvP.
---
Countdown to Classic had a very interesting episode about WoW Addiction where a caller talks about a similar situation. 
---
[https://countdowntoclassic.com/2018/12/12/episode-86-nostalgia-wow-addiction-mental-health-spell-batching/](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2018/12/12/episode-86-nostalgia-wow-addiction-mental-health-spell-batching/)
---
This guy is correct, the ranking will depend completely on everyones standing on your server. If you get into premades you can for sure obtain rank 10 with those hours played ~20 hours of solid pvp a week, you would just have to be consistent. 
---
There is also a patch where new blue pvp sets will get released. What is dank is that the original priest set has a 2 set bonus for +23 damage, and so does the new blue set that comes out later. So you can equip 2 pieces of new set, and 2 pieces of old set to get double +23 damage bonuses. 
---
You also mentioned "with other epic pvp rewards". You will have none, epic pvp rewards start at rank 12. This is classic, epics arnt handed out like welfare in america. It will take some raiders 6+ months to be in full epics that are good.
---
Entirely up to you. Be a ruthless killer and end them when they're weak or engage only in honorable combat. U choose. 
---
Sucks that warlock didn't get decurse over mage. Would have made more sense
---
I want to play a gnome, but I love to heal. What would be the best alternative support class to play as a gnome? (Warrior, mage, lock, or rogue?) 
---
Thinking more PvP wise. 
---
&gt; I still stick to the same tenants, but I go on wide tangents when I level because I like to run dungeons and whatnot.
---
right. i'm the same way. but i've avoided leveling past 40 on any private server so i'm kind of more interested in end-game content since i've been leveling exclusively for the past few years. so part of me is thinking of just trying to get 60 right away on my priest main.
---
think 6 months x 4 raids a week is 24 raids. Even if you got an epic every other raid you wouldnt be in full epics in 6 months. 
---
So it sounds like it is really good for the price and the heat is manageable especially since a game like that will be a lot more demanding than classic wow. That's prob the only game I'll be playing Haha thanks for the info appreciate it. It's much cheaper to install ssd yourself opposed to buying a laptop already with one. 
---
What? Why? What if I'm someone who's set on playing Classic, but I also want to be able to play BFA, either for roleplay or incase the game gets better, why should I have to pay twice?
---
And honestly, based on this suggestion you're the sort of person I wouldn't want to play Classic with.
---
Blizzard is in -8 timezone (PST) and has always operated from there. You kiwis are 20-21 hours ahead of their April Fools Day.
---
Dj tiesto while leveling as a hordie
---
I don’t agree with your reasoning but aside from that I’m surprised blizzard didn’t have some sort of cost to go with classic. I think they deserve it for all the work they have done on it. An extra 5$ a month in sun or something. 
---
If you haven’t seen the Ahead of the Curve documentary on Netflix, you should. It’s about flat earthers, and it’s not narrates, it’s just interviews and following Flat Earthers and letting them tell there side. It’s fairly neutral, but the editing and camera work really lets those goofballs embarrass themselves. 
---
Does someone know if 2 handed wep specialization is absolutely necessary in the arms tree for a warrior? I am only finding conflicting asnwers. Some say the 5% extra damage is a must because it applies to everything, some say it can be ignored because the points can be better spent elsewhere. Or does it come down to personal preference in the end?
---
This is an immense amount of work, but I thought there were more? Wowhead mentioned something to to tune of 4100 quests, unless those include each step of a chain?
---
Yes sir Daggerspine indeed
---
Hard truth: Blizzard will be balancing classes so they might not be the same class you played during vanilla and I'm ok with that.
---
Youwannato
---
There is so much unused space.
---
I've always felt like Fishing+Cooking was the absolute power couple. The shift from "killing kodos in desolace for kodo meat to eek out a few more cooking points" to "just fucking fish and cook and then go to the next fishing vendor and fish and cook more" was a wild shift.
---
If it's red it's dead
---
I would buy it in a heartbeat. My favorite expansion by far (I never got to play WOTLK) and I feel its totally a possibility if classic takes off. 
---
I would say the same as has been said before. Engage on sight or only if they attack first. Honestly you’ll get to know what the opposing faction is like after a while and that’ll affect how you react to people more than anything. 
---
I love Dun Morogh (all though it was my first starting zone so obv bias)! The music at night is probably one of my favorite parts of the vanilla soundtrack.

I’m torn between a rogue and a hunter. How were they in classic? 
---
I had fun with my hunter but I was so bad at the time I don’t remember how I stacked up damage wise in raids and dungeons. 
---
Rogue was fun but because I was primarily a jerk in STV.  
---
bloodvine set is bis until t3 and requires tailoring if you want the set bonus
---
What do you call "honorable combat"? If the other player was like 2-3 levels less than you, I don't really know if it would still be honorable
---
2 hours? That's impressive, how did you do it?
---
I always loved the fact that I could be a ruthless horde slaying murderer 99% of the time...but every once in awhile I would see someone of another faction struggling and help them kill their tagged mob and both go about our separate ways. Kind of an unspoken pact of listen we both don’t have time for corpse running right now. That being said I’ve encountered those very same folks maybe a few hours later and for whatever reason that red name would be a bit too enticing and I would say okay time to meet your maker buddy. 
---
To be fair arena alone holds up a large chunk of the subs
---
We dont even have an equivalent to mankriks wife
---
For horde, it's close enough where if I'm using 1h weapons from a previous tier, and a 2h from the current tier drops, it's probably better to go 2h. There's a lot of factors that go into it and it's hard to say at what point it's advantageous to switch. Generally though, if you've invested in getting Edgemasters handguards and/or you happen to have a lot of hit, stick with 1h and let your other warriors get the 2h weapons. I remember using a spreadsheet that would take various factors (fight length, spec, buffs, gear, etc) to help me decide which items to go after.
---
Yes, but so is alliance...
---
But then it's not classic?
---
An honorable kill is 10 levels.   Aka a battleground.
---
This is 100% false unless you are an rp player during the darkmoon faire. Even then its not even able to s ratch the itch
---
We do. That dorm doesn't look different from a US prison cell. Especially those industrial looking white big ass bricks do it. What college costs you in the US, you'd think you'd at least get a nice finish on the wall.
---
Quite eloquently put, my good sir. It is, indeed, the most prestigious realm category to adventure on. I guess we shall meet each other on the battlefield and fight with respect, no matter which side it happens you're on.
---
Thrall wouldn't be very proud to see you gank lowbies :3
---
I love bloody alliances corpses
---
I would LOVE a toggle. As long as the gameplay is the same, I'm fine with pretty visuals.
---
Attack anytime.   Which also means you can be attacked anytime.. like... 2 seconds away from completing a quest you spent 20 min on.
---
Again, they are alliance. I have always loved the hatred between the factions. Level is irrelevant, don’t play on a PvP server if you aren’t ready for that is my advice. 
---
I always help people, and then kill them as payment for the help
---
Yeah defias brotherhood was one of the most popular realms in eu. then in bfa they got rid of pvp realms and defias brotherhood started sharing a shard with argent dawn
---
Yes, if it gets enough upvotes today, it will make it to the top tomorrow, don't you think?
---
in my experience if its just 2 randoms of different faction questing they often will just leave each other be.
---
if one is high level he will go for the kill , if one has friends they will often go for the kill.
---
but often if its just 2 solo similar level players focused on leveling they just leave eachother be.
---
mostly because even if you gank the guy he can come back and bother you questing.  
---
i dont pvp leveling because i fucking hate questing so i just keep questing and ignore reds , if i get ganked i just do another quest and com back to that one in like 5minutes.
---
even if someone tries to kill me and i kill them its still annoying because they often come back and want more or wait for me to be fighting mobs.
---
those gankers are the worst the like im so shit i need to wait for you to pull two mobs ones
---
On my server the only people that got 14 were some college kids that literally played in shifts on the same character. You’d see the same pre-mades no matter when you logged in. I really hope they make the system less ridiculous than it was back in the day. 
---
My wife and i play horde.   
---
Mage or Rogue for pvp. Warrior is good too due to Gnome racial ability.
---
It seems that fate has directed me to reply to you once more, mister Quadstriker. I am glad to hear that you met your significant other whilst adventuring in vanilla times.

Haha yes that’s actually pretty awesome I like that middle ground. The kind of move that gives them a rollercoaster of emotions lol.

June 23rd to September 23rd.

Expect it to be released September 22nd
---
As a company? Releasing around when school lets out is a wise decision whether its the day or sometime after as it'd most likely bring in more customers.
---
Sure, the guy doesn't just represent the reddit hive-mind, you also exposed his exact reasons for disliking it. 
---
WRECKED!
---
Back in the day, it took me quite a while to realize that in-game time of day was related to my local (real) time of day. Granted, I didn't play much if at all during the  night but it blew my mind once I realized.
---
There is something so serene and relaxing playing in the Barrens, late during a hot summer night, with the game's soundtrack quietly running in the background and just grinding the levels away.
---
Yeah horde definitely don't have that at all
---
Rather that they should've just let the Star Wars movie series rest after. But gotta recoup that IP acquisition.
---
Yeah I’ve heard quite a bit about account sharing to reach it :/ it is pretty ridiculous that it is seemingly more and more impossible the more I talk to people about it. 
---
Sorry /u/ChimlyChannel While I appreciate your passion your outlook is skewed and can't help being skewed. 
---
You make some very broad sweeping remarks that just are not based in historical data. True blizzard historical data.  Please see [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4bxmo/research\_wow\_realm\_type\_break\_down\_by\_type/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4bxmo/research_wow_realm_type_break_down_by_type/) for research into actual number of PVE vs PVP servers that range from launch to when this data was irrelevant.
---
Saying that the truest form of the game must be pvp flies in the face of millions of players over the years who do not see it that way. It is an attempt to alienate one group of players. Back in the day we where called carebares, and there is no call for that. We can be passionate about our view without denigration. YOU did not denigrate.. But it feeds the cycle. Mind you people in the PVE crowd can be just as careless with labels. 
---
I believe an RPPVP server should be offered, but not because its the "truest" form of the game. It should be offered because people need a choice.
---
Thanks for hearing me out man. Please don't stop your passion or posting. We are one great big family of gamers who LOVE classic!
---
I've switched so much between official and the other category of servers we do not speak of that I don't even remember when they actually removed the day/night cycles. When was that?
---
You're right, I think that a good option would be to attack based on the opponent's race. E.g. since I'll be playing paladin, Undeads would be my greatest enemies, but peaceful Tauren are okay-ish unless they attack me
---
If it's red, it's dead.
---
See the post above mine.
---
Rise against and Sum 41. 
---
Also, Gnarls Barkley Crazy listened to that on repeat during BC lol 
---
About a thousand are various form of raid quests, reputation quests, darkmoon faire, opening on Ahn’Qiraj, battlegrounds, deprecated AV quests, and so on.  All those I specifically excluded because this is mostly about catching quests you miss while leveling.
---
I played in the High Warlord pre-made group on my server in 2005, my guildie got rank 14 on his rogue by playing 100+ hours the week he was rank 13. I think he went a bit overboard, but he wanted to make sure he got it that week.
---
mostly just chuck norse memes
---
im still not sure what happens when chuck noris kicks the immovable object
---
LFR. Go big or go home.
---
Im going warrior tank. I wanted so bad to be a druid bear with a mage side character. I have realized just how pivotal a role a tank is going to be. I know i can make raid times any day of the week. I know what gear i need for preraid. I understand what gear will be given to the maintanks of a new server. Im going to be taking off work to play this game and race to 60 the first week. 
---
If you are not ready to be competitive and play a role that depends on you for success of an entire raid. (Try pugging a 40 man with no MT) then maybe role a dps class. The amount of people asking to role a tank and be casual is absurd. They are in demand on every server as inevitability they get bored and want to dps or pvp for gear.  Tanks are a filthy class to handle. Very gear dependant and very team oriented. If you have a pocket healer you will do very well leveling. IF YOU CANT STANCE DANCE GOD SAVE YOUR PARTY/RAID. this is not retail. You will have to work and fight to get your shit. You will have to dedicate time to helping others because that whirlwind axe aint gonna be done solo. 
---
I cant role a bear and be ready to tank rag as no one else in the raid will be geared enough to have smooth runs on a new server. Its very time consuming to gear a feral druid for raiding. I have done it several times in zg bwl and mc but if youre raid isnt up to par its a shit show. 
---
Tldr hard work or easy money.

This isn’t Dark Souls PVP, no Boeing, chug your pots all day, murder them on sight.

I’ll be in stealth in the bushes in STV.

Guys about this situation here: [https://i.imgur.com/f3HDGlY.png](https://i.imgur.com/f3HDGlY.png)
---
As you can see, the dagger blade of cunning gives more dps than carving knife of power, but  when looking at the power stat the carving knife gives me 2 more points than the cunning dagger. So my question is, in my OFFHAND slot, which weapon one should I use?
---
Generally, when I'm leveling I don't like to waste time. If I'm not trying to PvP people, I'll hit them with a /salute. 70% of the time, they won't attack me, and we can go about out grind without issue. 30% of the time, a Night Elf Hunter has been shadowmelded in a bush for hours waiting to jump me. They usually win and I have to go somewhere else to grind for a few minutes (and make a 15 minute corpse run through STV). Rarely, I'll attack someone unprovoked, and we'll fight it out. If you do that, try and be aware that that person is coming back to kill you. Keep invis potions or some other way to stealth handy, so they can't get the jump on you. 
---
Too bad you cant make marks or anything on the maps, but is still unreal! thanks for sharing!

It would have to be the reverse: new models only as an option if it doesn't fuck up the old models.
---
i mean that’s like a 3 month window in which we all expect it to be released. not a release date. 
---
Hi, /u/ProbablyAPun
---
Anyone who hates it is a filthy dwarf. 
---
Ah, I see. That's a poor mentality unfortunately :(
---
Stam and int are easily the most important stats. Stamina is great for PvP in general no matter your class or role. Intellect is particularly good for druids because shapeshifting costs a lot of mana and druid need to shift a lot to be effective in PvP, especially for the kind of versatile playstyle you're after.
---
Exactly. old AV was the biggest draw for me. If it’s going to be a run last Zerg fest I’m not even interested in Classic anymore. 
---
I like that
---
When I was an orc, I usually would let the cute gnomes live, but would kill every cocky elf and smelly dwarf.  Humans were a bit of a 50/50
---
RP-PVP makes more sense than RP-PVE anyways. Roleplaying a Human Paladin and not being able to fight the Undead of  the Horde? Doesn't make sense to me.
---
And that feeling of playing all night until the morning. I remember the sunrise in mulgore on my first toon. Ironically, those first memories of WoW are by far the clearest for me. 
---
Had a “friend” trick me into killing a dragon in Tanaris that gave me hated with a faction....That was a terrible grind to fix...
---
So if I focused on intellect without agility, would I even be able to do any damage as a kitty?
---
Blood and thunder
---
wich server are you playing?
---
If you think they wont, you have never played any game where you compete for limited ressources
---
I said this a while back, got downvoted to hell.
---
I fully agree with you. 
---
Prove it
---
Look at the cables. I don't think he did it voluntarily :) 
---
That’s rather damn rude dude. Some people like warrior dps and hate tanking. Why should they be forced to do something they don’t enjoy? It’s attitudes like this the that will cause people to just quit playing classic rather than put up with judgemental dickholes who think they get to dictate how strangers get to play.
---
Keep in mind most consider tailoring min/Max not just to get bloodvine but also for set bonus. Hit has less value for mages since you have talents so your other gear would likely be the decider for you. I'm honestly bloodvine has sick itemization and if you're a min/Max person you need tailoring. If you're like me who wants to be efficient but not trapped into something like that then do your own thing
---
Tanks are always needed for 5-10 man dungeons, while melee dps is more replaceable. For raids you don't need a ton of tanks, and melee dps don't bring any essential utility. 
---
With that said, I think warrior is the way to go unless you want to play solo pvp. I've been eyeing a fury prot hybrid build which I might use for endgame in order to be flexible with dps'ing or offtanking. 
---
I'll be so disappointed if RP-PVP isn't available at launch!
---
Well, wPvP sounds like an aspect of Vanilla WoW that is too big to miss... Yet if I play on a PvE server while being PvP flagged I'll always get attacked first so that's annoying. I don't mind being ganked sometimes, but if it gets recurrent then that's a problem. Is it the case with the original server caps or is it only happening with the private servers?
---
Eh, I get where you're coming from, but as someone that played mage at the tail end of vanilla and mid way through BC, I don't think you're quite understanding the sheer scope of the issue that is causing mages to dislike making food for everyone.
---
It takes 3s + 3s + 3s + 3s to conjure a stack of food and water, which doesn't seem like much, but a lot of times people will demand two stacks, which is half a minute of casting, then trading. So, 35-40s. Mages just need to git ovir it, rite?
---
Except everyone wants food and water. *Everyone.*
---
And they *demand* it.
---
Giving someone fortitude takes half a second, and you don't get dozens of people demanding fort every time you step into a city, like it's their god-given right to be handed a fort just because they logged in.
---
I don't know about you, but I'm not spending half an hour every time I step into a capital city making food for demanding, aggressive assholes.
---
Which causes people to go cry on forums about how mages 'refuse to use their kit.'
---
Just try to see it from the other side, man- it's not a big deal to you, but mages get absolutely *assailed* with this bullshit, and then they have to deal with people cursing them out sometimes just because 'no, I don't want to do you a favor you demand of me, random guy that did the equivalent of stopping me on the sidewalk and demand I give you lunch.'
---
Or passing those bandanas to rogues that you met because here’s a helm item friend. 
---
I am actually doing the same thing! I was an alliance hunter, going horde, either priest, shaman, or warrior. And a hunter for money making :) 
---
play as pure feral till 55, then start gathering int and healing gear, respec into resto at 58, heal dungs till 60. You can heal almost all 5mans as a feral so dont worry.
---
Oh hey, I actually remember seeing a NE  rogue named Roc. You worse those giant T1 shoulders, right?
---
Looks nice, but only have time to skim it right now. I see you are missing info on 2H fury. I'm particularly interested in how much better the weapon needs to be to beat out duelwielding, for horde and for alliance. 
---
Warrior, rogue or hunter?
---
First of all, all I said was that the human racial does not add up to an extra epic, which it doesnt.
---
Second, even with Blue Dragon you're not gonna get an average of12.5 mp5 from the +5% spirit. A priest would probably have 200-300 spirit, depending on the patch. At 300 you're looking at 15 spirit, which on average (with the Darkmoon card, 3/8 T2 and 3/3 meditation) would maybe grant 5mp5 and +4 healing. Hardly game changing, even at fairly optimistic values.
---
While FW is indeed irrelevant on most fights, the fights on which it is relevant it's crazy good. Having a FW in certain fights can, with some frequency, be the difference between a wipe and a kill. It's certainly far more impactful than +5% spirit.
---
I mean, ennemy around your lvl, not when hes fighting a mob etc
---
I remember wall jumping to a roofing the horse fortress on my hunter and just going to town on alliance fuckers with volley.
---
for $900 you could build a machine that would run 12x wow apps at the same time with no trouble. People use to play on potatoes. But nowdays $900 will get you pretty close to a great gaming pc. Hell your macbook might run it just fine.
---
HotW spec for healing dungeons and be good in pvp
---
Care to link it?
---
I'm taking enchanting later.  Just mail your greens to a bank alt and use gathering gold to make up the difference.
---
If you want all of your gear enchanted as you level with +3 stam and stuff then you can take it from the start.  But I personally, even as a completionist type of leveler, find that to be very unrewarding.
---
That's not true. The drop chance of eye of divinity is somewhere between 25 and 50% (have seen both, so  not sure which one is right) and eye of shadows 1% from the demons in winterspring. If RNG screws you, you can still purchase it through the AH when you do the necessary farming. At the least you will get it from Kazzak in phase 2 of classic, as he drops it 100%. In phase 1 it'll definitely take some weeks until you'll see the first priest wielding it, but this number will increase by the week. 
---
R14 takes way more than just getting lucky with loot/rolls.
---
Hunters are top tier class only if the hunter knows how to play it.

My first toon was a Night Elf Druid.  I got him to level 8, fell off the side of Teldrassil, died on a branch halfway down, had NO idea how to get back to my body, and rerolled.  LOL
---
Boombox? That you bud?
---
Still remember my first 1337 crit, eviscerate in hillsbrad, it was near the AV entrance. Strange how I can remember that happening 14 years ago but i can't name a piece of my hunters armour in BFA aside from the heart of azeroth. 
---
Leet
---
Ok so you’re gonna learn real fast that the opposing faction will gank you always. While you’re killing a rare, doing a quest, drinking water, AFK in a neutral area, landing at a flight path, etc... People do not care what level you are. You will die a LOT, being gangbanged by a group or a level 60 when you’re level 12 in Westfall. 
---
However, this should give you some insight :P There is no common courtesy given to you, so don’t give any to others. Usually if I’m trying to grind a quest and I see a group of Horde, I leave them alone and run to a safer spot. If I’ve been killed 409 times in a row and I’m seeing red, I’ll attack anything in sight and try to murder everyone I see
---
I generally avoid fighting unless I have to. There are no rules though, and always expect to get ganked. Don’t get mad, get even. 
---
Yeah, I wouldn’t mind sticking to a mac since I do use Logic Pro for music stuff. But I’m not crazy about the current mac book pro options, especially for the price. I don’t really have a huge desk to play at on my small apartment but I feel like having a desktop setup with large monitor could add to the feel..I use to play on a shitty massive dell xps haha my current MacBook Air can’t support WoW, at least not retail currently and it’s only 11 inches
---
Iv never built a machine kinda nervous about that haha if anyone has experience using a mini pc just looking to get some input on options 
---
Go rogue if you want to do endgame and raid a lot.
---
In the end however, play what you think is most fun, of course hunter will work in raids too but not as sought after compared to rogue and warriors.
---
They're fools if they don't open at least one. Isn't RPPVP more popular than RPPVE anyway?
---
They hated him because he told them the truth.
---
Oh man have they mentioned true day night cycles yet!? 
---
This is hilarious the engage as soon as you eat to full health is the cherry on top.
---
This is huge.
---
Sure thing brother. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/DbxUi8G) and album after logging in to check on my old characters. If you want more proof, don't be hesitant to ask.
---
Feel stupid?
---
Awesome series of screenshots man!
---
50-100 is probably the most annoying to grind.  I just make it a point to kill every plainstrider I come across while doing other quests until I finally get 100 skill in cooking.  The same goes for Southern Barrens, I kill thunder lizards while running in between quests.  Cats in Hillsbrad, every time I have to run back to Hillsbrad Field, I kill all cats.  It's easy to bake these grinds into your leveling.  Once you hit 175, every level 30 zone will drop something that can get you all the way to 225.  You just farm them while you're questing.
---
TIL there's about 3000 quests in vanilla
---
Do you think you will need multiple bank alts to do this? I've never leveled enchanting before so I dont know how many mats are needed to reach 265, but does 1 char have enough bag space for that?
---
Thank you for your service
---
It is a pier! It's home to a quest chain that has some not bad rewards but requires a lot of swimming and running back and forth to STV.
---
Good video!
---
According to a 10,000 person poll, yes. 
---
Question, how did a guy rob your guild bank when they didn’t exist? 
---
For mages and warlocks who raid mostly with gear that doesn't have stamina like bloodvine set, can that be a problem?  Or do buffs provide you with enough HP to give your healers enough time to heal you?
---
i dont know how generalizable it really is but my female friends always pick "pretty" characters, preferrably female ones if possible. the horde doesnt really have a pretty race to chose pre-tbc, i.e. these girls would never want to play on that faction.
---
&gt;small PP PvP server

&gt;big PP RPPVP server
---
I mean... quite so, good sir. In fact, I have heard that players who often congregate on servers that allow both worldbuilding and epic battles are, in fact, stallions when it comes to bedroom matters.
---
Do guilds that use DKP also use that system for ZG and AQ20?

Do guilds have 2 raids for ZG and AQ20?

---
I had a lot of different gear but I typically wore 5pc Nightslayer and 3pc Bloodfang when I pvp’d and I’d rock that 120 energy daggers spec for the sweet burst, so I think those giant T1 shoulders got a lot of love.
---
But my main spec was combat swords, and I had AQ40 t2.5 shoulders.  I had the sword from Chromaggus and Iblis, the offhand from Naxx.
---
That UI bro....my eyes are bleeding
---
same way you *need* WOW Classic. You don't.
---
I think people are overpreparing. There's a video guide on every single little thing these days.
---
People are all about "no changes", but the biggest violation is just knowing everything there is to know in advance. IMO that goes against the spirit of classic.
---
Personally om gonna keep away from these guides and learn along the way. Then hopefully I will actually be surprised in game by stuff, rather than taking this up as some sort of work project.
---
As all druids should be?
---
I don't think they removed them.
---
I think I was watching a video comparing classic to current or something like that, and the difference was that there were some ppl who didn't like playing at night so blizz just made the night more brighter. 
---
I don't know when they did this but I think I watched the vid after legion came out 
---
I had a friend of mine get 13 on Hyjal but was never able to get 14. He even switched on and off with his GF at the time and wasn’t able to make it. He talked to the people that got it and they told him about how the only time they weren’t online was during downtime. They had about 3-4 people playing in shifts to ensure they got 14. 
---
For someone who did not play Vanilla and has no desire to raid at all in Classic --- How much fun do you think Classic will be just purely as an old school PvE MMORPG for a player whose focus is entirely on other things like questing, crafting, leveling up alts, and maybe light RP?
---
I think it is a disservice to the rest of the player base to not fulfill a need that you could easily fulfill.  Nothing rude about it, just reality.  And the reality is that you'll be waiting longer for groups on the average.
---
You'd have to simulate DPS specifically to get an accurate answer. 
---
It all varies by weapon, but to put it broadly: 2H is a lot more viable on horde than it is on Alliance due to Windfury. For Horde, you should watch out for BRE and The Untamed Blade, as those are generally pretty good due to the procs. For Alliance, the only really viable 2h Weapon is BRE.
---
Keep in mind this is assuming your other 1h weapons are comparable.
---
Still using default ui though.
---
Or, unfortunately, they won’t say anything about classic.
---
Careful he's a hero
---
If they’re a rogue and especially if they’re undead they’re going to kill you. Most people roll them for PvP because of Will of the Forsaken. 
---
Got him. Fake story. 
---
Thanks, I thought you could craft mail, I just couldn't quite remember.
---
Not much. Druids aren't really great at dealing damage no matter how they are geared though. Probably the most effective gearing strategy for a druid focused on versatility is stam = int &gt; + spell dmg and healing (not +healing) &gt; &gt; everything else. That way you can shapeshift a lot and do good damage and healing with spells.
---
You'll still use cat form and bear form a good amount even without much str/agility. For example it's usually smart to start off stealthed in cat form to open on someone and dump all your energy before swapping to another form. And if you're ever kiting or line of sighting someone and drop out of combat you might as well swap into cat form to stealth and get another opener. 
---
Bear form has feral charge and bash so it will get used a lot no matter what you are facing. Also if you are getting attacked by physical dps or being focused by a bunch of people you can stay bear form to survive longer while getting a lot of rage for frenzied regeneration + maul and swipe spam.
---
If you don’t care about meters and enjoy ‘playing your part’, resto druid is a fine choice. You’ll constantly be at the bottom, however this does shift once you start getting AQ (and some ZG) crit gear as Moonglow spec becomes more effective. AQ also has more movement during encounters and poisons so using HoTs makes sense then. Naxx is where druids really shine and their t3 set bonuses are fab. Question is, are you gonna be around long enough to make it that far?
---
I forgot how beautifully complex Feralas was. 
---
Thanks. :)
---
This is amazing!  Thank you for sharing this!
---
you are... you know what you are right. was just about to watch it. thanks man!
---
The best cases of this occur when support gets on and posts their racist chat logs to shut them up. 
---
That's when I innervate myself. Although I will Tank the first month being 60.
---
I might only get it, because I love to max everything on my main.
---
Don't worry about me guys, I know what I'm doing.
---
Kill all enemies on sight.
---
Wait for them to get full HP? I guess if you're RPing a nerdy Paladin who cares about fairness.
---
You won't have enough space on one alt unless you're serious blowing cash for early bags and bank slot unlocks.  It doesn't take long to pump out a couple Lv1's and run them to a city.  I'd highly suggest having a couple alts just for sanity.
---
You only need to be Lv5 to learn enchanting and disenchant any gear, of any level, that is BoE your alt receives.  This way you can count the stacks and do a little math ahead of time if that helps you.
---
Played on Lightninghoof (RP-PVP).
---
RP-PVP has RP, but it really is just a PVP server that removes all the toxic players. 
---
Well yeah I can see that. Considering most of the intended demography will have their summer vacation during that time.
---
I do believe the warriors $15 a month states they can play whatever the hell they like. It’s a greater disservice as a whole to force players to play something they aren’t interested in specially while levelling. If you meant end game raiding you might have a point  but levelling anyone can play whatever they want provided it’s not ret.
---
A majority of the game was just leveling, crafting and alts. Many people never even stepped into the raids, and only casually did pvp once the battle grounds were easier to queue for. You should be more than fine without raiding.
---
In theory you can chuck the BoP greens in your bank and horde them up until you swap. In practice you're going to be flat broke without the added vendor gold.
---
Gathering proffs will probably be very slow to level. Will probably be stuck farming a few hours for the last 5-10 points of each breakpoint.
---
Had a buddy of mine on Hyjal who practically lived in BGs to get to 13. He had his GF play him while he was at work even. He still was never able to break into 14. Turns out there were a couple guys who were friends in college and took turns helping each other get to 14. The only time their toons weren’t on and grinding was during downtime. 
---
The closest is Westfall.
---
The UI is what sells the whole screenshot.
---
That doesn't make much sense.  You're paying a subscription to play WoW.  The subscription rate has always been $15.  Why should it cost less when they're adding a feature by player demand?
---
I got one of those too in AV, [some time before patch 1.10](https://i.imgur.com/WBrnGJy.jpg), I took a screenshot because it was on our server's biggest asshole.
---
I eventually got [luckier](https://i.imgur.com/9EMyC2g.jpg) and [better geared](https://i.imgur.com/64oxTfJ.jpg) too, but apparently I was never good at making a decent UI or drawing dicks in MS Paint.
---
Oh no, stop...please stop. 
---
I have one of those cheap external usb 3.0 dvd/blue-ray readers. Maybe used it once :D
---
Will Southshore vs. Tarren Mill (the actual open world version) be a thing again in Classic, or is the patch they're starting with going to be after whatever changes caused it to no longer be worth it any more?
---
You'll love it, a huge amount of play time in Classic is dedicated solely to the journey of questing/leveling up, professions are very useful in Classic as well since some of the items you can craft are BiS for at least a while. PvE in this game is also rewarding, there are 19 dungeons you can traverse while leveling up, 6 of which can be continued from the mid 40s or 50s until max level. Alts are very fun as well, there are many different zones to level and different paths you can take to keep it fresh each time, and plenty of things to do to waste time and/or make money. And if you feel like delving into PvP you can play casually in Alterac Valley which also has PvE in it.
---
Soloing classes... hunter and warlock are probably best? Throw Druid in there too because of healing, stealth, and travel form?
---

I always give people the benefit of doubt. I don't necessarily engage in open world PvP if I see some poor schmuck doing quests by himself, but everyone is different
---
That’s literally what I said while reading it. 
---
meh
---
Its kinda meh when you first get it, hitting for 84 instead of 80 won't change anything really. But once you get higher level and start hitting for hundreds it matters more. So you can bypass it at the start but you're going to want it eventually.
---
For those who don’t know how it worked. The Vanilla PvP reward system gave you a rank based off of the total score that you got each week. The rank you got was how your score compared to the total score for your faction on your server. Each rank had a bracket range and in order to get Max level at 14 you needed to get within the bracket for rank 14. 
---
As others have said, you'll probably have a great time without raiding. Just want to point out though that leveling dungeons are not like they are now, and sometimes took serious time commitments. I remember my first dungeon ever was wailing caverns and we were in there for like 3 hours.
---
So do what you want then, no need to throw a fit
---
I don't know the specific spec, sorry. Google HOTW spec. 
---
It's essentially a Feral/Reato hybrid. 0/30/21 or 1/29/21 depending on your needs. Again, INT and STAM is what you want to focus on. AGI and strength may help but as someone else said, as a Druid your goal is to survive people to death. 
---
Since that spec gets you all of the main resto spells you can essentially heal early raids with healing gear then go out and tank a dungeon with tank gear, then take either gear set out and PVP some. This video is a very good intro to it; https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh_6Cxf6ehU&amp;t=538s
---
It's the spec I'll be rolling at 60. 
---
Fucking 1:1 screen ratio with that UI goddamn I love this shit
---
Usually guild leaders would have a character made like a bank alt, for the guild. So the GM was the only one that could actually rob the bank. But no one else would really know about it.
---
Watch Stormx and Finalflash druid PvP montages. Cat form is not used much in PvP.  Stam&gt;armor&gt;int for WSG.
---
Yes, on the old 1.12 client. The new one is slow as fuck loading in.
---
There’s actually 4342 in the tables I pulled this from.  A quarter just happens o be things that aren’t really related to leveling or cut out quests like “collect 10 night elf asses in AV”
---
My hope is that if I did send all my greens to an alt that the added gold I get from another gathering profession would balance it out or even put me ahead. 
---
Feign Death Trap Macro...

Thats really surprising. I cant imagine someone not liking the original day/night cycle.
---
As a Druid LW is pretty damn awesome. If you don’t have time to farm every piece of gear you can make a bit of healing, a bit of feral and a bit of tank gear for yourself. Also you can’t drink potions in animal forms!
---
My point exactly. There's so many forgotten details to look at. I.e. notice how everyone is sobering up in the "chat log". Farming different potions, flowers and fish, and so on, was a major part of being an end game raider back then. Unlimited buffs was in reality a horrow show. 
---
There's even an addon that keeps track of "offline" count, as people dropping out, due to bad connections, was a major issue back then.
---
I've heard several people say this, but I can't find any sources for it
---
I'd go with agility. Gives you armor, crit, dodge and attack power
---
Usually officers have access to it also. 
---
That timer in the top right, what UI addon was that apart of? Looks familiar.
---
LW is super cheap to level, fairly uncommon too. Might be able to really turn a profit on shoulders/helmets and the random high agility pieces.
---
Not sure if you meant weeks instead of months, but 6 months of 4 raids/week would be 144+ raids
---
It's only a sausage fest if you roll Tauren. :V
---
It has similar applications like vanish, in PvP you can force the enemy to de-target you, and even waste their spells. Unlike vanish, you can't nullify spells after they are cast.

During Vanilla there were an abundance of Rogues, so while they were useful in groups and raids, you had competition. Not just from Rogues either, but Fury Warriors being top melee DPS took up a lot of room, and I remember 5-mans where Warriors would not want Rogues there to compete for Swords and being Warriors they would often get their way.
---
While there were a fair amount of Hunters, many sucked and because this I never had problems finding a spot. I eventually found a good guild and went all the way up to and completing/farming Naxx. So while Combat Sword Rogues (Combat Daggers too, but I remember Swords being better) are tier 1 DPS along with Fury Warriors, there was a lot of competition.
---
Either way Hunter or Rogue, if you're a good player who knows what they're doing, there will be room for you in groups/raids. It always helps to make friends with tanks and healers, and find a spot in a good guild if you have the time to dedicate.
---
Shapeshifting costs a fixed percent of your mana. So more intellect won't actually help much.
---
Don’t gank lowbies.  Some will do this; they are dicks.  
---
Can't remember. If I recall correctly, some of our late game addons was made for internal use but im not sure if that's the case with that one. 
---
It seems that will of the Forsaken is the reason there are more hunters on the alliance side.  Hunters and Warlocks fill a similar "easy leveling pet class" niche a lot of players like.  
---
There are always more warlocks on the horde side, because alliance does not want to have to deal with the Forsaken racial talents. So it seems 3 % or so of the players who enjoy the warlock/hunter pet play style will be opting to play hunter on the alliance side instead. 
---
From what I remember is they were weekly. O e week wsg, another week av, another week ab and then darkmoon fair

DRUIDS SOUND AWESOME
---
I will be leveling in a duo playing a warrior my cousin is undecided in his healing class. 
---
That was the dumbest thing I remember.  Joined a group for mara as the tank.  While we were waiting, they made some explanation about loot while I was afk on a gryphon.  First drop we get is plate with warrior stats and I roll need.  They throw a bitch fit because I, the only warrior, rolled need on the warrior gear.  They kicked me.  Their healer said they were retarded and left with me.  I got a item and they spent an hour in general looking for a tank and healer before giving up.

Wrong. Shapeshifting costs a fixed percentage of base mana. Which is the player's mana before factoring any bonuses from intellect or anything else.
---
Took me a second to realize that "Skabb" (nice name by the way) was not a Forsaken Shaman; his portrait just happened to share more or less the same space as some Forsaken in your party.
---
Why overlap two party portraits? In Naxx!
---
Sure, they are very useful in a 5man when you can be sure they will get value, or in pvp when any instant cast spell comes in handy. In a raid with a bunch of holy pallies and priests with twitchy fingers hovering over 1.5 sec heals desperately looking for any red bars to heal; no, hots are not worth casting.  
---
It takes 3 seconds for the first heal to land from a rejuv. You would be very lucky to get 2 useful ticks in a raid, meaning they are definitely not worth the mana to cast.  The only use of hots in a raid is weaving in a regrowth to setup up a swiftmend in a place where you know there will be a spike.  
---
If you want to be a good resto druid you have to know your strength. That is downranked HTs with tons of +healing. Slow efficient heals. I wouldn't say you should never cast hots, but if they're more than 5% of your healing of mana usage you're probably not playing as well as you could be. As discussed many times with meme dps, whether that matters or not is between your raid and you.
---
Dual Wield Swords with Combat spec was and probably will be the main Rogue DPS PvE spec in Vanilla/Classic.
---
It's too lucrative, there will be many servers with devilsaur cartels.
---
I guess my server was the exception then, and no, it wasn't an RP server.
---
I got no problem driving to a store. :D
---
DKP guilds will use DKP for everything unless they are hosting a PUG. Players will always need things from ZG so they will always go back and do that. By the time AQ is out, the other raids should be on farm and cleared quickly so having multiple raids on one raid night will happen for sure. Depending on your guild and raid schedule 
---
My guild had 4 characters that were our bank. Usually each character was for specific mats. We kept a spreadsheet to track everything.
---
Your statement coincides to my own coital experiences, thus I must conclude it is, indeed, a verified fact. 
---
Dude I enjoyed every single minute of farming Exalted with Timbermaw! Not everyone feels the same way
---
A wierd bug that occured and never managed to fix during the naxx days without overhauling the raid specific addons. Tight schedule back then. 
---
This may be the worst ui in the history of wow
---
Don’t you have a phone though?
---
General rule is r13 for casters r14 for melee.
---
Each class is a bit different, believe Hunter r12 gloves are BiS forever.
---
I forgot that there was a minimap for bgs...
---
Yeah it's a bit like PW:S. Absolutely terrible spell for efficiency, but if you only have one global it's your best spell. So it can come in handy once or twice a fight, but if your priest is using pw:s constantly they're playing terribly inefficiently (just like a druid and rejuv).
---
Another thing is to pick a faction and see about getting all available classes with the fewest races. For Alliance, that would be Night Elf and Human to cover the 8 classes. Horde would require Tauren and Forsaken.
---
I say this is more so of a problem in retail if you are very talkative/troll a lot in LFG chat. At the start of BFA, everyone was talking about politics and I just chime in and then before you knew it I was muted. Which was frustrating to say the least as no one else was muted. Are we not supposed to bullshit and troll around in chat? One thing I loved about vanilla is for example the iconic barrens chat. It won't be the same with this system. 
---
It must be removed.
---
The Molten Corgi.
---
Seems like a no-brainer to me...hopefully they are just pacing their release of information. 
---
Hopefully. 
---
Dying on the far west side of Ashenvale as a horde, and the spirit resser was on the right side.
---
That alone was almost a 10 minute run
---
it shows the quality of map design when you see it like this - it looks like a pretty real world (apart from the obvious crazy colours etc)
---
Needs more early 2000s metal music.
---
1 hour and 21 minutes?? Too long for me.
---
Harsh Truth: I needed on items for vendor money, and will do it again.
---
Just put it on in the background while you grind in a pserver
---
As far as I can tell the evangelical no change supporters are primarily driven by a lack of trust in Blizzard/Activision. Nobody is going to buy a 10,000 rpm magnetic head drive and install Windows XP to play WoW. People understand there are going to be differences however they generally don't trust Blizzard to decide what those changes are.
---
The two side characters are great....they are probably what people who never played on an RPPvP server think of when we argue for one. 
---
This is quality content
---
That sounds amazing but I'd hate myself for the rest of the day doing something like that now. 
---
I wish...
---
Only disturbed or it doesnt count.
---
Its super easy as a feral druid to get enchanting to 265, you stealth in uldaman etc. Dont save too much on bank alts just make a few runs through an instance like shadowfang keep when you are 55-60.
---
So take herbalism + skinning while leveling, and drop skinning when you are getting close to brd or at 60.
---
Would you mind sharing as an update to OP's work?
---
Note how at some point, lifetap moves from a sidebar, to main actionbar, to a keybind.
---
I entered MC in greens, and leveled 1-60 without really using lifetap. "What a stupid spell, why would I want that?"
---
I my defense, I was high a lot :D
---
Wow I did not know that last portion. Thank you for that info
---
I have one in a drawer at my desk, i took it out and opened up my PC to reinstall Windows a few months ago.
---
I remember the first time I saw those three whilst levelling as a lowbie dorf priest, wondering why three Horde players were walking through Loch Modan!  Took me all of 30 seconds to realise they weren't players, at which point I turned and ran like hell :)
---
Still remember running in to them a few times during over the years, running my many alts through there.
---
Are you fury spec without bloodthirst? So confused by the PvP with no 31 point on your bar...
---
This is the one "improvement" I have been most concerned about... more than sharding or loot trading. 
---
Giving players a way into the banning system is too much
---
So he basically confirmed the problem?
---
They never talk about the true duo God comp... And I won't either...good... good.
---
Well said. 
---
If you can't dance, play alliance and have your fear ward ;)
---
What quest addon will you guys be using?
---

---
I like watching these videos purely for the nostalgia, but your point is still valid...  
---
Maybe I'll go watch some dungeon run-throughs instead. 
---
He said it was "Yolostomp"
---
Well that's enough to evidence to prove that he may be slightly retarded. It could be down to the brain damage he likely received from when his mom used to smack him about.  
---
TLDR:  
---
1. Paly/Lock - Infinite mana/hp lock just dots everything in range
---
2. Mage/Mage - frostbite shatter stacking is nuts, aoe all the things
---
3. Druid/Lock - Basically same as paly/lock but druid gets a dot (or two) to add
---
4. Arms/Enhancement - Cleave, wf, shamy has some range/wolfy to help pulling  
---
I think it's a bit odd he skipped hunter. If you're just talking speed I would think double hunter would beat all these, and hunter +druid/shamy would as well. For levelling it's very hard to go past BM hunter. I guess he just thinks hunter is boring I duno? I have to admit lock + healer does sound fun. Obviously slow walking to lvl 40 is pretty sad but the kill speed 40+ could well make up for it.
---
No, alliance were more mature than horde back then.
---
With how easily people believe things nowadays, this warning could save lives. O\_O
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
Can't be certain for Mages, I can't recall. But I remember Stamina being verrrrrryyy important for Warlocks. 
---
This is my impression as well, but there will be alot more competition for good 1h's than 2h's, so it isn't unlikely that you will be able to snag a higher tier 2h. Obsidian Edged Blade vs Dal'rends? BRE or Untamed Blade vs Brutality Blade? 
---
I suppose the supporting gear also plays a role, hit chance and weapon skill in particular. I doubt every warrior will be picking up Edgemasters in practice. 
---
In addition to WF making 2H better on horde, i think the lack of blessing of salvation plays a role as well. In addition to Bloodthirst and Windfury, duel-wielders will spam Heroic Strike, and create a lot of bonus threat. 2H will use Hamstring or Slam instead. 
---
Battleground holidays occur during all weekends, starting on Thursday night at Midnight and continuing until early Tuesday morning. During a holiday, emissaries from the featured battleground are found in the major cities, and honor &amp; faction rewards for performing objectives in that battleground are increased.
---
And he's a rogue so there's no raid frames...
---
Now I know why some people never play healers. 
---
You don't need the trinket if you don't want it. You can tank just fine without it.
---
You can get a vigilance charm, or just get a dps trinket - that's probably what i'm gonna do.
---
Having different combat logs open is actually a pretty neat way of keeping track of crucial actions.
---
Even if someone else actually needed them?
---
only 3 combat logs? you some kind of casual?
---
I've gotten a lot out of Kargoz's videos. I'll be duo-leveling a warrior with a priest. Should make the grind to 60 a bit more bearable. Fewer corpse runs are always welcome!
---
Bruh, iS tHaT tHe LiOnHeArT hElMeT~~? 
---
LEET
---
Damn, I get chills just by looking all these places.
---
Yeah all of the points you bring up are very valid. That's why it's hard to give an answer to a question like that, it very much depends on all of the circumstances around you. In my opinion, I'd keep an eye out for good 2Hs and make the switch if I thought the competition for other weapons was tough. On alliance side however I'd only go 2H if I could get a BRE.
---
sausage is typically pork.... if that's what you were going for. But I commend your unique take, albeit a lil nauseating 
---
^ this
---
Well to be fair, there have been about 5000 other crits and armour pieces you've come across since then
---
I remember this too, but i can’t remember if it’s in 1.12 or 2.0. Before that you could not cast a spell on the target as there was a stronger spell on the target
---
Can we trade friends?
---
Most off them is dragged out powerpoint presentations that explains quests chains that got 5 steps
---
6-8k? spent too much time on pivate servers with this pop, im cursed and dont wanna have less
---
Haha trust me, you’re better off
---
I will genuinely be upset if there isn't an even 1 RP-PvP server. Like.. up until now, I hadn't even considered not having one a possibility. Just one. That's all I ask for. Please
---
When I came back during WoD and I was in a garrison. Alone. Doing free-to-play style quests that only improved my garrison and has no bearing on the world.
---
Also, when I booted up Wrath, and realized how streamlined every quest hub had become. Once you see the pattern, you’ll never in-see it.
---
Same here, my friend. 
---
i think not. but im pretty positive that they are gonna implement it like it was back then.
---
Didn't auto shot clipping literally get a one button macro for Steady Shot to min-max damage in TBC? Or was that later. 
---
Not saying they're one button btw just remembered it. 
---
because there were probably some people who could only play at night and didnt want to play in permanent "darkness".
---
I want to main Druid, i really like class abd all 3 spec. But i hear a lot of bad comments about druids. I have plan to mostly do leveling and pvp, very casualy pve. Will i be less viable in pvp ? And how about Nelf or Tauren for pvp ?
---
Ah so you actually believe that flagging yourself on a RP realm, people will not take advantage of that?
---
I like your optimism.
---
Nightfire is such a vanilla name as well.
---
R14 only takes time 
---
Grinding rank 14 isn't good for your mental and physical health imo. Not worth it no matter how much pride you get from it. Hopefully they will change the system somewhat.
---
Oof 
---
What level do you need to max leather working though? Isn't it 35? I plan on leveling skinning and herb or mining on a character and taking the corresponding crafting professions on the other. 
---
Something to keep in mind in classic vs TBC and after, nothing really crafts BoP. So, if you plan on having more than one character, it can be a good idea to employ some synergy. Double gathering on my better farming class can come in handy.
---
I keep a "live and let live"-policy, names on my shitlist excluded. If you won't bother me, I won't bother you. Tho I will be keeping an eye on you, in case you try some funny business.
---
Wow hemo performed pretty well, huh??
---
what do you mean? thats just some 3D holographic effect, so the maintenance message is displayed propperly.
---
maybe this will help a bit 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNRZZL5nViU
---
Kargoz loves hunter! I think he's planning on maining one come release of classic. I would guess he skips it because of its self-reliance; they dont really need anything to support them, and due to the movement speed differences it probably ends up being a slowdown.
---
It's definitely worth a mention, though, with the combos you said.
---
Hemo...
---
Your quest chain column helped me a solve an organization problem with my own quest database. Thanks for that.  
---
Yeah. It also made me think of 007 Nightfire, that game kicks ass. 
---
They won't.
---
&gt;Are you fury spec without bloodthirst? So confused by the PvP with no 31 point on your bar...
---
It's in his sidebar, bound to F. 
---
Ya. All alliance chat.
---
In my mid 30s, so yeah, was knee deep in undergrad when wow came out. 
---
i can somewhat understand the pve servers for the pussies, but a rp pve server is just self contradictory. rp is all about immersion, pve server are the opposite of immersion. it just makes 0 sense to me.
---
Probably mid wotlk. Wrote a ticket to a GM asking if it was possible, got rejected.
---
That isn’t true. You could eat and drink at the same time at all stages of wows release, including day 1.
---
Read the title, and then read the comment that I replied to.
---
In pure dps fights, such as Patchwerk, I would normally lie slightly below the other rogues. The idea was that one rogue (me) ran hemo specc to boost all other melee. 
---
I'm a woman, and I'll be rolling Horde for the first time in classic. I think I always chose Alliance because I'm not a very aggressive person--competitive, yes. Aggressive, no. And the Horde races were way more violent than the Alliance races, lore-wise. It wasn't a "oh, pretty humans, ugly orcs" thing. It was a lore thing.
---
being able to kill clear naxx without any keybinds an this kind of UI really confirms the fact how much of a joke the classic bosses were.
---
It still is
---
Damn man, getting me stoked to roll my Lock on classic launch
---
Bik yikes
---
you were 100% &gt;that&lt; guy that always died to void zones, and now I know why. 
---
Typical Horde can’t 1v1 😉
---
Hunters have it easy imo.
---
Free great weapon from AV.
---
Tier sets are actually great (except 2.5).
---
PvP gear paired with a survival spec tanks you up nicely.
---
DM gear fills the gaps with amazing succinctness.
---
Trinket options are easy (2% crit/PvP trinket/engi).
---
Can sit in the back spamming viper sting and putting your cat/bat/wind serpent on a healer. 
---
Stock up on anti venoms, FAPs and pots and enjoy.
---
Nay.
---
It's on the innermost right-hand side action bar. Mapped to the F key.
---
They never have? The only thing they removed was when it would randomly rain in zones. 
---
Wasnt like it is now in Vanilla tho
---
It’s not about them taking advantage. Getting the jump on people is some of the fun which you cannot do if they aren’t flagged. 
---
Have you played a PvE server and ran around flagged? Most people just pass you by. 
---
Compare that to a PvP server. 
---
There are about a dozen now. If you decide you don't like one just try someone else. Frostadamus seems to be the only person liked across the board.
---
The game is not too hard to start. I would check out a guide to affording your mount at 40, maybe a leveling guide specific to your class. 
---
There still is. Shift m 
---
Indeed. Ran one log for all actions, one for actions towards my target only, and one log for just my actions. 
---
You're gonna be there with us other old fucks to show these kids what for, right?!
---
Same faction sure.
---
Any hint of cross faction collusion will cause bans in the same vein as win trading.
---
Being friendly is a risk, since it potentially ruins an advantage; however, there's always a chance that the other guy could have already attacked you beforehand.
---
There's also a risk in starting a war in a leveling zone, because unless you're about to move locations, they may spitefully (and rightfully) spawn in and try camping you when you're weak. 
---
All that said, it's all a part of the leveling process, so you really need to base your decisions off the moment. If you're low and see an enemy who could easily finish you off but doesn't, then that might mean you should leave them alone too. Not everyone has this mentality, but it's basic social etiquette to me.  
---
One thing that helps deter world-PvP while leveling, is having a buddy to level with. Enemies are less likely to attack, and if they do you might have the advantage...or at least a chance. Why would you avoid PvP on a PvP server? Because sometimes you just want to level or make gold. 
---
I like world PvP, but not if it cripples any other progression I'm trying to make.  
---
I don’t feel that old, but my elbows do. But yes, I’ll be there with bells on.
---
PSA: don’t do lots of heavy triples and singles on bench press in your 20s. It’s not worth it.
---
Not only the tips. But the loading screen art as well! 
---
Ion just tweeted that he doesn't want to release an RPPvP server at launch.
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1109832561704878081
---
Let's break down the arguments and lay out why it's a good idea to release *one RPPvP server at launch.*
---
1: Ion says he wants a lean realm list. Just 1 additional RPPvP server, or converting one RPPvE server to an RPPvP server, would be more than enough. Not having a server type is outrageous.
---
2: Ion says it will "be like 2004." Classic WoW was never designed to be like 2004, he is contradicting himself to weasel out of this.
---
Classic WoW was designed to *recreate 1.12, the definite version of Vanilla WoW.*
---
Why are there no 1.0 talents? No 8 debuff slots? No 12 hour queues at launch? No server crashes?
---
Because it's meant to be 1.12, not 2004 launch. **And 1.12 had RPPvP servers.**
---
3. He says he wants to see if there is interest. **How can we show interest in a server type that doesn't exist?** Absolutely absurd.
---
 There needs to be at least 1 RPPvP server. This is so basic that I guarantee you that 99% of people took it for granted that it was going to happen.
---
Please, everyone, tweet at Ion. Post on the forums. Make your voices heard, **because today, Ion does not want to release Classic WoW with any RPPvP servers, going against how it was during 1.12.**
---
Forcing so many players to wait and see if a server is released, to reroll, for some guildies to not reroll, splitting guilds, alienating friends, dividing communities that want to play together... it's just a complete disaster. But they have been humble, they have made changes, they have heard us.
---
GO TWEET AT ION, POST ON THE OFFICIAL FORUMS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE, LADDIE.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/rp-pvp-realms-reconsider-one-realm/130723/330
---
Man anything over 5k is cancer. I really hope it's around 3-4k.
---
They also need to bottleneck the network and make servers crash all the time. 
---
Not a big deal if they level together they won’t be as gear dependent anyways. 
---
Druids are very capable in pvp, high damage and roots are invaluable. In pve they are also good, just dont expect to be at the top of any charts unfortunately. They have great heals but get sniped by faster heals of priests and pallies. 
---
*All* of your time, to be exact. Benediction doesn't nearly come close in time investment, and I'm saying that as a soon to be priest main who's obsessed with that staff.
---
It’s true the paladin will be better at group pvp content and the shadow priest will be better at solo pvp content. 
---
You have to weigh it carefully. 
---
Nope they had actual invisibility which broke on spell cast.
---
If you need proof, search “nerf the Mage wow beta”.
---
Update is he still doesn't want to do it.
---
I broke down line by line why it is a good idea to release one RPPvP server at launch and why the current arguments against it are misguided.
---
They've been humble and made 180s on things before. Loot trading, content phases, spell batching. There is still hope they will see the light with this. But TWEET AT ION.
---
Just like they said they wouldnt do classic wow huh?
---
i remember packing my PC and monitor onto a wooden waggon ( the kind of you can pull little kids around) and walking a 40min walk to a friends house so we could play together when BC released.
---
You can enable PvP on a PvE server, right? What is the difference anyways?
---
I feel ya there. Lore wise, as an Orc, I aim to be a follower of Thrall's style - peace and respect when possible. Tauren seem pretty un-aggressive culturally too - a strength when necessary kind of thing. 
---
Play on a pserver. Leveling is definitely harder. It is nostalgia fueled for sure but I’m excited regardless. 
---
Someone posted time-stamps in the comments.
---
It's not hard. Just time consuming.
---
How’s it like with that many people ?
---
I'll look for the post where they said they will balance classes. Why would anyone in their right mind think they would leave some classes and specs unviable? 
---
aotc owning a flat monitor.
---
Ion has no intention to release with an RPPvP server. Blows my mind. Like you, 99% of people including me never imagined they'd do something to ridiculous.
---
There is no way I'll play 2 months and then reroll, or whatever. It's going to sever my guild, fragment my friends, some will reroll, some will stay on some random server, total disaster. 
---
Tweet at him and make yourself heard.
---
will be as it is now, in classic, i think
---
Ya your lay out is a million times better then the others. The pre raid bis and post raid bis is much easier to look at along with showing the changes between patchs. I think they should follow your design.
---
I especially love coming across a couple.  Kill the guy, then help the girl.
---
Keep killing the guy, keep helping the girl.
---
The more the better. 
---
It's not nostalgia.
---
I play with only one addon (for UI) the amount of text here is so painful.
---
Yeah, but what makes it awesome compared to the current game?
---
Reckoning/holy build let's you pull out a 2h and one shot somebody. Then just swap back to healing. Hilarious.
---
What's a pserver?
---
Play a dk, love tanking, and hitting hard in pvp (which we can't do anymore for some reason o' retail.) warrior is an easy choice 
---
dude you only get one life, do whatever the fuck makes you happy, don't shame yourself for others' opinions
---
I remember an ele on Hordeside (alleria) that was one of the only pvp eles I would ever see.  He stacked crit and would just destroy people mongo style in AV. 
---
It was fun to watch.
---
So there I was... yeah, these are the healing pants

---
I don't think you know how the system work if you think 1-11 is half way to 14. 11-14 requires MUCH more work. Constant premade teams, and you absolutely need a good standing to rank up.
---
You are misunderstanding the topic here. What is the difference between flagging yourself on a RP PVE server vs doing it on a regular PVE server?
---
Nice, milking the value of that nightsky cowl :)
---
Its not so much that i specifically miss Classic content. It has alot more to do with the feel of danger, the dark feel of the world, and how the game felt pretty brutal in general. Also, doing anything required large amounts of effort, and character progress actually made you proud. Retail wow, is just way to easy, to convenient, less gratifying. Also, Classes don't feel unique anymore. It just feels like i'm playing the same class, and there are only a few variations. 
---
I’ve done warrior shaman I think my cousin is leaning priest I think they’re both solid picks. 
---
Anyone seen the Messenger?
---
Nothing was quite like the Barrens, but Ironforge was maybe the closest.
---
I went through Westfall first, and the Barrens was straight up a different experience.  There is something about the atmosphere, size of the map, the large level range that got you in the perfect attentive but still sorta bored state of mind that created that kind of chaos.

I don't give a fuck about other people's opinions. Especially not about whatever games I like to play.

&gt; Quests don't appear on the map, they don't show you where to go, you're forced to read them and explore your surroundings. You have to group with people to do a dungeon. The fear of dying is real, you're not unstoppable and you can't take on the world.
---
Mage/mage might be fun for leveling alts to be able to port us eventually. I plan to run a second account and eventually have a 60 lock for summons and 40 mage for ports. Also probably going to level alts to 35 eventually way down the road for multiple transmutes. All to fund my warrior which I’m leveling first. 
---
Yes, but will Classic have Hobbits or not ???
---
I am confused. Wasn't all for Classic servers when Nost was shut down?
---
NA Emerald Dream alliance was the best back in the day. Goldshire was always poppin'.
---
there is not really a lot of good gear to be made by lw other than ony cloak, devilsaur and hide of the wild. none of the recipes are extremely rare, only the mats are quite expensive so you won't cash in on big tips unless you're one of the first to craft those.
---
herbing (no real need to go alchemy as well, since again, the mats are the rare part not the recipes) is the better and more reliable moneymaker.
---
RP... 
---
I work at a high school and the biggest factor in whether a lot of kids will pick up Classic or not is how many big streamers play it. Currently there's not really any interest that I've seen from my students, but if some big names started streaming it, they'd check it out. 
---
I'm going to split hairs here and draw a distinction between "fun" and "rewarding."
---
Classic WoW is absolutely *not* going to be "fun" the way I think most people mean the word nowadays.  It's not going to have the constant action of games that many are used to.  It's not going to have the same crazy power fantasy that retail apparently does.  What makes the game great is how rewarding it feels to accomplish something you've been working on for hours and hours.
---
It's one thing for a game to throw a mount at you, and have players think *"oh, okay, I can go fast now.  Neat."*  It's entirely different to make them grind for dozens or maybe hundreds of hours to finally earn that mount and let them think *"ohhhhhh SNAP!  I FINALLY GOT MY EPIC MOUNT, WOOT!"*

The appeal to classic to me is the effort/feeling of accomplishment. Yes, it may take some players 6 weeks to get to 40 and get their mount. BUT, they will feel alot of accomplishment for getting it. The thing about classic is that there are objectives that are clear cut and take alot of time to work towards. Players feel rewarded for reaching that point and remember the journey. The problem with retail, is that it is so convenient and constantly dumps rewards on you that you never have that feeling of accomplishment.
---
I find the description a bit over dramatic...
---
1. You will find lots of ret pal, enhancement chaman, shadow priest that will accept to res, as you accept them in a group even if they bring a non optimal spec.
---
2. If you gain sharp with hots, a priest would have gain aggro otherwise. Plus, if you play alliance, you can shadowmend pre pull even with hots on the target. Moreover, you can continue to drink while the tank has pulled and let the dot continue their effect, + swiftmend 2 or 3 seconds later, quite efficient in terms of règne.
---
3. Swiftmend, plus, the best mobility in the game...
---
4. True... I often found my 4.4k hp were not enough, as you don’t really have defensive cooldown, appart from nature’s swiftness and swiftmend. But still, you have quite a high survivability if you are not stunlock.
---
 5, Quite true but:
---
- in 1.12 you also have swiftmend which allows an instant cast on a pre hot target. Definitely quicker than a priest flash heal.
---
- when you are really Geared, you downrank to HT rang 3 (even 2), even if your +heal is not fully useful then. With this, you can clearly compete with priest “healing” or flash heal, which is not mana efficient.
---
Overall, you are right, Druid hav weaknesses, but not as big as it seems.
---
Retail is basically a mobile game on a pc while Vanilla is an awesome epic MMORPG game.
---
&gt;Unless you are top 1% it does not matter at all
---
Except for when the difference determines whether or not you actually down raiding content in an iteration of the game where over half of the world interaction has been sacrificed in favor of instanced PvE content.

Repentance was a prot talent back in the days. Also, it required 5 points in Improved Seal of Justice to unlock.
---
How this fatass is still relevant is beyond me 
---
I remember during the moonglade festival I read the quest-text as being able to teleport there under ‘moonlight’ so I tried every night for days, even convincing my dad to let me stay up until midnight. Turns out I had to stand in the moonbeam in SW 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Cassandra's Grace. Helmet with a crapton of +healing while only being a 46 or so requirement. Pretty sure it is pre-bis or the next best thing.
---
Oh yes it was
---
hey man thanks for the comment :) The whole "truest" thing is just my opinion and i appreciate you recognising that I wasn't trying to tell others that their opinions are invalid.   
---
That data is very interesting, thanks for bringing it to my attention - I wasn't actually referring to how it was back in the day though, since I wasn't around then. I was referring to how the majority of players seem to do things nowadays - very interesting to see the split was much more equal back then though!
---
I really miss the rain. One of my earliest and fondest memories in WoW is fishing while raining in Elwynn Forest on my paladin. 
---
I had a dream that on launch day, there was one RP-PVP server, and it was overwhelmingly the most popular and was the sole server with an outrageous queue.
---
I don’t even want to play rppvp, but the prophesy cannot be denied now
---
Private vanilla server 
---
Being as hardcore of a raider I can be without neglecting my family or career.
---
lol 
---
Wow. So we definitely have their attention! 
---
You can be for Classic but still not want to play
---
I’ll definitely be making a 19 again. 
---
Troll hunter.
---
When I couldn’t find a solid group I knew I picked the wrong char. 
---
imho it's better to take it at the start to disenchant every quest reward you don't need and get points and mats from doing so.
---
i assume you didnt play back then if you dont understand that. 
---
its just basic nostalgia imo, even if it is hard to grasp on a game u dont have much nostalgia for
---
Personally,  I think I'd prefer 5-8k. Anything &gt;10k would require changing spawn timers and I don't think Blizzard is willing to modify the game in such a way.   
---
Altough with a large number of servers with high cap (ex 15k) I think there would be a natural distribution of populations: you would have low pop and high pop servers and everything in between so ppl who prefer certain populations could choose a server they like. Then most servers would have medium pop compared to the cap, which would probably please most ppl.  
---
Don't lie, you loved that UI, everything was exactly where and like you wanted it to be!
---
Me and three other close friends are going to get classic when it comes out (we used to play burning crusade back then) we are going to all go orcs and have a group with a tank, healer, and two dps. Will it be possible to just grind dungeons till lvl 60? Can we level quickly as a group or will have to solo play and goto dungeons just for items?
---
oof
---
What is the best class to OWN people with alongside a shadow priest?
---
Warrior and shadow priest combo?
---
The difference of armor (about 600 in bear form) is quite huge. Vigilance charm is quite bad (2% dodge is nothing) and you will not use a dps trinket often.
---
Kargoz does longish streams and is way too lazy to spend time cutting them down into watchable videos so they just get posted in full. Tried getting through one of them the other day since it was only an hour and a half or so and I was interested, but he spent more time talking about how amazing it was how many people he had in the stream than he did about the subject of the video. Got so fucking annoying that I couldn't keep watching.
---
I plan to resurrect my Orc Warrior as a Shaman this time around. I really enjoy the idea of a powerful warrior enhanced by the elements. What are some stories and experiences you had as/against shamans in Vanilla? How about some realistic expectations for endgame pvp/pve?
---
Yeah it’ll be fun to an extent.  You have to keep in mind that it is a grind. Every part of it. But it’s a grind that rewards you in the end because you know you’ve earned what you get. 
---
Gonna have to wait a while. BGs won’t be released for some time.
---
Thats super awesome. What made you pick a shaman? Asking because i still can't decide what class i want to play.
---
Hunter doesn't need a duo, they're already duoing with their pet. If anything you will slow yourself down by leveling with someone. Although running with a druid wouldn't be too bad since they can keep up better while traveling and can heal your pet or tank in bear form if needed. 
---
Lionheart helm?
---
hit 60, buy helm, you're set for 3 tiers of raiding, gotta love it
---
The fact that it's not a lobby-based "MMO"RPG is enough reason to make it more awesome than the current game, not counting all the other flaws introduced every expansion.
---
Druids are really fun to level and are such a unique class. If you like playing them, then I’d say go for it - there are always matchups that you are good or bad with, no matter what class you play. Additionally, I’d say look at what character models you like more - I prefer the night elf forms a lot more over the Tauren ones, so that’s the way I’d lean because I think they’re more visually appealing. 
---
Sure you will. 600 armor is a few % at most, it's very very close to 2% dodge if you do the math. And as a bear tank you're there to do huge threat, you're not gonna be tanking a mob that hits that hard. A dps trinket is awesome for that.
---
I've tanked MC with a dps trinket specifically to do the highest amount threat possible, with no noticeable reduction in survivability.
---
RP-PVP servers a good if you want to pvp, but also avoid the most toxic players who are now in their 30's but still act like they're 14 (like in private realms).
---
I guess I was close to 200 days /played those days. 200 days of in-game UI perfectionism. 
---
Heres the issue, just talk no number s. How about show us xp per hr grinding and xp

Nothing screams awesome and epic like 90% of your gameplay being running or doing nothing.
---
Its a better MMO but its delusional to call it a better game.
---
Stolen silver still hasnt dropped for me.
---
Is there something special about that number?
---
I have a strong desire to smash people with my lightning hammer, Thor style. Simple and sweet.

Know that if you give them a chance to fight fairly when you stumble on them low health, they will not return the favor when they stumble on you being low health. 
---
If you haven't played on a PvP server then you're in for a different experience all together. In general, you will be ganked. It will suck (for you). Especially in zones with brutal distance for your ghost walk. That being said, each time you're ganked, your hatred for the opposing faction will grow stronger. It's totally up to you, but I have no problem killing people 5, 10, 20 levels beneath me. It only adds to their own hatred for your faction, and thus making end-game world PvP all the more common. Part of what makes leveling fun (to me) in a PvP server is that you are unable to \_fully\_ relax. You're always panning your camera around looking for a red nameplate...or on the lookout for a trail of wolf corpses, etc. It's really exciting, and if you have to die a few hundred times throughout your journey, so be it. 
---
As a Horde player, I loved teaming up with Shamans. They can really elevate their groups.
---
I plan to go Shaman as well, but am worried that shaman will be the most popular class, and I cant be a special snowflake :’(
---
RDX
---
I think pet classes like Warlock and Hunter are very friendly to new players of vanilla.  Expert solo and for leveling, but then they have the added benefit of being classes you can really put expertise into once you are familiar with the game. 
---
This poll is bad. I want around 5k and you’re making me choose between two bad options at 2k-5k and 5k-8k. 
---
Eventually yes. Looking at 39 or 49 bracket first. 19 is fun but I prefer to have a few more useful abilities on a char
---
Statistically about half the enemies you come across will be high level than you, in groups bigger than yours, and will come across you while you're fighting mobs.     
---
   
---
What was that about kill them on sight? Oh right no one actually does that, they just like talking like a 12 yo gangster on the internet.
---
chuck norse reaps skulls for the skull throne
---
I’d also say a big part of speed leveling is doing quests that make sense together. So if you are in a zone, maybe make sure you do a big circle around an area, killing a lot of mobs while also knocking out 6 quests in one swoop. You come into town an hour or two later, sell, repair, rinse and repeat. I think it would help to have a quest addon to show you markers of where all your quests need you to go - that may not be a purist mindset, but I enjoy the achievement of leveling more than reading and understanding the quests, personally, so those addons save a lot of time and headache. 
---
I had a 19 drood heals and a 39 ret pally
---
Mainly the fun of playing again and experiencing the old quests and dungeons.  I would like to raid again at 60 since my guild was just clearing MC in the week leading up to TBC launch.  On the other hand, I've talked my gf into playing it, so it'll probably be more stop and smell the flowers than power leveling to 60.
---
It would take a lot longer for you to just grind dungeons. The fastest way to level is by doing quests throughout both continents. You will also be able to pick up a lot of quests for dungeons along the way and be able to do that together too. Have fun! 
---
Oof
---
I love the RP vibes. The people are so much more into the overall lore. They also tend to be really mature because they’re looking for a fun experience. Guild events or community events that take place outside of Battlegrounds or Raids really make the game come alive. Walking around UC and seeing people discuss their characters plans for battle and such was always so cool. Also, legit names are a huge plus. I’m always take so long planning my ideal character name and seeing people named “Memelord” or “xXLegolasRebornXx” really ruins immersion.
---
Alliance get Duskwood. No chat but the best zone in the game.
---
I love the estethics of Loch Modan. Such a lay-back place.
---
I'm hoping it'll give me an edge over all the night elf Hunters/Rogues in Ashenvale, and the mass of warriors in general.
---
This is before paladin talent remake in patch 1.9. Repetence was the 31 point talent in protection at that point, and divine favor was 11 points into holy. So he has reckoning in this video.

If you get camped in PvP, just log on your alt for 30 minutes. I never understand why people rage 
---
Based on pservers, I think shaman and Druid will be the least played. We’ll see though 
---
I think the short answer is no, but something that people enjoy about Vanilla is the ability to even attempt stuff like this.  You do you.  
---
Charge, hamstring.
---
Horde. Played girl for 18months, met 5 (online and IRL afterwards on guild meeting) girls in ~60 core members guild. Was immerse fun syncing our periods.. ;)
---
I guess numbers will be different this time, more like 15% female.
---
ahh right!  i was around from something like 1.2 or 1.3 onwards but i never knew that :O didn't play a pala at the time so i wouldn't really have paid attention
---
Very busy at all times of the day, and the starter zones are always full of players.  Personally I think its a bit much, but you certainly don't have to worry about a "dead" realm.  
---
Why?
---
Is there a hugh gap between 9-10?
---
Yeah what do I know. I have only played wow since 2008 and emulated Vanilla since 2015.
---
Fun is one of those things that is subjective.  I believe it will be fun for me.  
---
I did a hunter the first time.
---
I was sick of getting lumped in with the idiots and a hard time getting Raid spots.
---
Going holy priest this time around. I love healing and never played a priest before 
---
I am pretty sure I have figured this out. For PVE players, the enemies are on the screen. For PVP players, the enemies are *behind* the screen.
---
I understand being a little cautious, but I don't think Blizzard - even today's Blizzard - would make an April Fool's joke about sharding on Classic. 
---
Unless it's a joke on how *sharting* will be disabled in Classic.
---
Thats a good desire. May you get many procs 
---
Can you please read some more context next time so you actually understand the whole topic?
---
This is probably a dumb but also curious question.
---
(Will Orcs still have straight backs in classic?)
---
I only ask because its weird that its the same race since classic and knowingly that they were originally broke back Orcs from the beginning, they would still add that feature since the Orc should've been upright as well in the first place. 
---
Logically Bliz would stick to the script and keep broke back Orcs, but it just doesn't seem to make much sense. All these years and the Orcs finally figured out how to straighten up?
---
Thats what im thinking yeah. But i dont remember it ever being the place to hang. 
---
Really having a fun time making these Lore videos about the Dungeons, and learning a lot too. Hope you all enjoy them as much as I do making them.
---
I usually just act in my self interest. Ill leave people alone if Im not sure I could take them, or if having them hostile to me would probably slow down my questing. But Ill definitely pvp to take a spawn on a long timer
---
Bug
---
Why they do him dirty like that? :(
---
they will (most likely) have the original broken backs
---
thanks :O i just said to another guy i was around taht that time but i never knew (or dont remember) that repentence was in prot
---
Are you being intentionally dense? Or can you seriously not understand the difference between the server types? PvE and PvP realms are different. The same applies to RP versions of both. Read through these posts here and you’ll get the idea. You wouldn’t tell someone who wants to partake in World PvP all the time with other like minded players to roll a PvE server would you? Then why are you asking why flagging on an RP - PvE server is not a good solution? It isn’t even close to the same experience. 
---
This screenshot scares me. Every time a pic like this is posted people mention healers and how horrific their UIs are and I’m considering playing healer.
---
Never head of this but it seems pretty interesting. I was wondering what would happen if you stacked spell gear and used scrolls lol.
---
Did you run hemo your entire raid career?
---
Opinions can't be delusional...
---
I plan on it, but alot depends on population/bg distribution. Probably a 39 or 49 though. 
---
Yea, I didn't realize most ppl prefer sub 8k. I should have put more options around 5k to see the nuances.
---
Assuming the game will be released on a Tuesday, they usually go live after the reset around 9 or 10 in the morning right? Or is it midnight? I was there for a couple crazy caffeine grinds but I forget exactly how it works. 
---
The reason I'm curious is to see if it's worth it going into work on Monday. If it goes live at midnight, then I probably won't bother.
---
No, not until I got the maces from Naxx. Ran swords before that. 
---
Honestly, rested does not accrue fast enough to really warrant swapping between two constantly. I guess it depends on your weekly playtime though. If you are not in that big of a rush to level, you can push one to 45+ and then let it rest some. 
---
Hunter and warlock are both pretty self sufficient.  I've always like mage in general and it should be able to find a role in pve and pvp.  Also, any of the healing classes are always in demand.  I don't think there is a wrong answer unless you just hate playing certain classes.
---
Doing God's work here. Thank you.
---
My wife and I are on a pserver right now, and this will help keep us from finding ourselves in a questing dead zone.
---
Plenty of people do it. What classes you choose is entirely up to you. I'd recommend some combo of fast leveling classes though, like lock/hunter so you have minimal downtime. Or one slow, (Warrior) and one fast leveler. 
---
Professions are whatever, just don't double dip. You can either have a dedicated farmer alt (You can use a macro to switch between different gathering tracking presumably. Or just use a gathering addon) and a main with just standard proffs (like Alchemy/Eng) or split the work if you are going to main both (Mining/eng, herb/alch). It's just preference and how *you* plan to play the character
---
You'd be wrong. Student will live in concrete block buildings and they will like it. I mean, between these living quarters, and their leftist professors, is it any surprise that the college kids think the Soviets did nothing wrong?  /s
---
It's good to hear that, considering that I plan to be a very active member of the community.
---
no, I mean it as you can do MC and BWL once a week, and onyxia every 5 days but lets just say 7 for easy math.
---
So in a month you do all your raids 4 times each. In 6 months you will have done MC and BWL 24 times each(I guess really 26 cause 52 weeks in a year). Chances of getting an epic item every single week after week after completing all your raids is pretty slim.
---
It's going to blow your mind when you realise you can put sprinkles and chocolate topping on your ice cream at the SAME TIME.
---
I love these albums. You can just imagine the journey from noob to slightly-less-so! Makes me wish I'd have kept my old screenshots.
---
This time, the journey definitely won't be the same, but I'm gonna take an unhealthy amount of screenshot. Shoot, I might just keep OBS running so I can press record if anything cool happens.
---
Prepare for a midnight release.
---
Omfg shoot me
---
No offense but this is kinda wrong, u only need 1 bank account. U don't even have to use money on bags at all. All you have to do is send them via mail, then you don't accept them on your alt (let them stay in mailbox) this way u have 1 month of "unlimited" bag space and after 1 month (even if u are not level 60 yet) u can just return them all and send them back to your bank (not this will cost 30 copper per item per month) but tbh that is nothing.
---
Of course they can but that's not the point. 
---
Spamming Frostbolt is not complex, engaging or interesting gameplay. YOU might like it more which is fine but its objectively worse than any other expension after Vanilla. 
---
Grinding mobs is not complex, engaging or interesting gameplay. Quest design is objectively better every expansion after Vanilla. 
---
There is a reason not a single game nowdays bases their entire gameplay around just grinding mobs.
---
Its going to be worth it within the first half-hour when a spider parries you 5 times in a row.  
---
The nostalgia argument gets thrown around too much.  Sure it's a part of the equation and tastes evolve over time, but a game is either enjoyable or it isn't.  We won't know for sure until after launch, but I feel confident in what they want to do.  Even if you're on the fence, it seems worth playing for a month to find out.
---
Do it on a staycation one night!  It's fun every once in a while. 
---
That’s so bad ass that someone has the same thought process as me. 
---
I mean literally the exact same, as a decade long warr main I’ll be resurrecting my old warr Arudas as a shammy this time around 
---
I think grinding dungeons will be slower because you're  always dealing with elite packs and without the quests, you'll be getting much less XP/hour. I think your best bet would be to do some questing and mob grinding. There are a few youtubers who are big about duo-leveling ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4) is a good one), so you might even consider splitting into pairs to do some efficient grinding.
---
That said, remember that vanilla is as much about the leveling experience as it is about the end-game content. So you might want to consider taking things a little more slowly if this is your first time through the vanilla content. One of the big reasons many of us have wanted vanilla back for so long is that the later expansions have all been about the end-game, which creates this disconnect with the world. I would seriously suggest you all just enjoy the ride. It's a bit slower, but so it's half the point of vanilla.
---
Don't get me wrong, I understood my role in the guild was to make food and drink for everyone and I always did so without complaint. I'm talking about the sheer number of people who would demand food and drink because I'm a mage and they are just too lazy to get it themselves. 
---
Keeping an eye on your target target's was a big deal for melee dps in Naxx. Usually it wasnt "that" bad. 
---
Playing sham on p server and realizing that as a kid i was too dense to understand the playable but now... it’s bad ass enh runs the 1v1 PvP scene 
---
Was anyone else expecting "get guys, it's tips"?
---
Eh? I played back then, I don't get how this have anything to do with what I just said. I played the shit out of vanilla and I have very found memories of it, shitty graphic isn't part of those found memories.
---
The only time(s) I was ever banned/punished was because of players abusing this system which was back in Cata when I used to raid with this guild who had 1 female druid who every male used to froth at the mouth over. She was absolute dead weight, put in minimal effort to improve and had all of her pots, elixirs, enchants, BOEs etc purchased for her with the guild bank money and was just a general hindrance to our overall progress. She even used to get certain male members of the guild to log her account and do the netherwing dailies for her. (more on her in a moment) 
---
Me &amp; certain members of the guild used to do weekly runs of various instances in order to get the mounts and on one week this dead weight druid decided to tag along on one of our tempest keep runs for some transmog pieces. As by pure chance after around 50+ runs the ashes of Alar actually dropped and she instantly demanded that she should be given it as it's been her favorite mount since BC and to my horror all of the other guys in the raid who like me had spent 50+ weeks running it were all in agreement that she should be given the mount. Naturally I disagreed and once they had all passed I hit need and won the roll. There was a mass guild drama on vent and I was demanded to put in a GM ticket to have it transferred over to her which was never ever going to happen and resulted in me being kicked from the guild. 
---
Over the course of the next 2-3 weeks I was temporarily muted twice, hit with a 1 day ban for "player harassment" and also had to change my 2 main characters names because they were all of a sudden deemed "offensive" despite having them for years with no issues (The names in question were Zargov &amp; Khazgul.) I knew it was them as I used to get snarky whispers saying stuff like "Nice name :)" from 2 level 1 characters both of which had taken the names of my mains that I was forced to change. Anyway I got the last laugh as after all of this I would spend lots of game time just following her around on my new fancy mount spamming /flex and to top it all off she couldn't afford the fastest flying mount speed so she could never get away once I was following her. 
---
Finding cover and making a fire with my wolf in Feralas 😢
---
For one thing, it's the original.  Numerous games have tried to be WoW or at least adopted things from it.  It really says something  that after all this time, WoW is still the top of the chart for the genre.  Plus, even though they're rolling back improvements that have been made, they're also rolling back the gradual changes and bad practices that have irked people about the latest expansions.
---
Just expanding for myself, the fast off hand you might want could be [Alcor's Sunrazor](https://www.wowhead.com/item=14555/alcors-sunrazor)
---
The [Volcanic set](http://classicdb.ch/?item=15749) might be nice to wear with this if going FULL proc gear set
---
I'm not sure if warriors can aquire the feralheart set, but some pieces might be nice if they can, since they have +spelldamage and strenght. 
---
Druids are a ton of fun in PvP! As a true hybrid class, you can make some really fun builds and have a large toolset. Other classes will almost certainly do individual things better than you will, but you'll be able to do most things pretty well. Since PvP is about people instead of scripted events, the variability of your responses will be great. My main in vanilla was a priest, but I leveled a druid just for PvP (originally a 29 twink and then up to 60 for other PvP content) and they're just a ton of fun.
---
So how many people are playing this amazing game in 2019?
---
Lmao gosh, apologies I mixed my spells I was speaking for Shadow guard. 🙈. Appreciate the clear up and the correction to misinformation 
---
Don't give them ideas, we were joking about the new Diablo title being for mobile only few years ago too and look what happened.
---
If it's my opinion that the earth is bigger than the sun, then my opinion would be delusional.

Considering Boogie said the Holocaust had some good come out of it, I'm not keen to listen to anything he says.

Berserking is the best dps racial for horde, so yes it would work great
---
As long as you're top dps, who cares about ui?
---
It's just a different artsyle. People prefer different things, that's all. I'm sorry that you find it complex, but it really isn't. 
---
Unless thousand others do exactly the same as you

---
Seems that way so far, their original 4 stage plan was going to have Battlegrounds come out with BWL. I don't think they've said specifically on that point with their revised, but it should be within 1 phase of BWL if that makes sense. I would be shocked if bg's came out with phase 1.
---
Better = more fun.
---
Vanilla is better than retail.
---
So cool! What was the 'lock set at the end, there?
---
Even if they're only playing for the PVP (like me) it doesn't mean they necessarily care about ganking while levelling plus orc is just as viable for PVP as undead is.
---
Thank you for taking the time to make the content!!
---
That is the very reason I took some time out one day to work on this project. I had started to notice a trend that all pservers where pvp therefore there was a understanding that that is how things have always been. There is nothing wrong with playing on a pvp server. But we must always look at all perspectives and realize that our fish bowel is not like others, so to speak :)
---
Okay, you are another drone incapable of understanding simple concepts, never mind.
---
I see no reason why those couldn't work as long as you have people dedicated to it.  The tailor guild would be tough unless you have a group willing to monitor the AH frequently to buy and sell as needed to manipulate prices.  But that assassin's guild would be cool.  Not sure what sort of price or business model you would need, but there have been times where I would have handed over some gold to see someone get ganked for a while, and the RP aspect would help.
---
I REALLY looked up to Thrall when I was playing my Orc Warrior back in the day, so it'll be fun emulating him. When I start a guild during those chaotic initial months, one of our ideals will be to represent the guild, and the Horde honorably. Although I plan to do a lot of world pvp.
---
I was convinced that I wanted to roll Warrior this time around because of all the videos of "Warrior master class". So I leveled on to 40 on an "undocumented server" and I'm glad I did. I couldn't see myself rolling that as a main in Classic. I don't like the plays style very much, and such a demanding leveling and gearing process.
---
Why bring boogie here? His [opinions](https://i.redd.it/nh3ey82jk6x11.png) are better left ignored.
---
I played a ton of vanilla and I only went on a handful of raids. Loved it! One really big part of vanilla is the leveling process and as long as you get yourself to stop focusing on end-game you can have a really good time. The world is much richer before the expansions because you spend so much more time in it. And there are always other players around in the low- and mid-level content, which helps so much. 
---
For classes, I would suggest you look through them and figure out what *type* of character you want to play rather than worrying about getting recommendations for any kind of "best". You'll be spending a lot of time with them, so just play. When people talk about a "best" class it's usually for a specific purpose (BGs, quick leveling, raid DPS, etc). **Every** class is suited for solo and group content if you're not worried about min-maxing or shooting for topping DPS meters against raid bosses. You can also just create characters and put a few hours into them to see what you like.
---
I can give you suggestions based on your preferences, though. Picture your character. Do you want to do damage, support other players, smash faces with a big sword? Do you want to have a simple character or a robust set of options? Do you have a faction preference (Horde vs Alliance will also determine if you can play Shaman or Paladin)? I'll be happy to be a sounding board for you. Or you can go check out some Classic content on youtube. There are lots of content creators that discuss choosing a class.

Mage is universal, and good for everything, and if you decide to swap gears you always have him as a gold farming char. 
---
gameplay is quite straightforward, and its really hard to mess up as a mage.
---
imo the best entry level class. also fairly gear independ in pvp, so you start being impactful instantly, easy gold making, your own food/water and portals.
---

speaking of warlocks and hunters that ppl are suggesting, they are much more complicated. a lot of things with pets, warlocks are food in pvp for melees, hunters expected to do some pulling, kiting and more advanced job, and a lot more technical in many aspects in general. aswell as knowledge how pets work, how to level pets abilities and so on. pvp is complicated and require ton of nuanced knowledge experience and approach. dead zone is frustrating, you die from dots and so on.
---
both also got trashy dps in raids, warlock only start pwning in later tiers, in first raids both of these are two of the worst dps, actually. 
---
hunters are always trash and also you need to sweat like a bitch in dps just to do something, casting abilities between autoshot timers. 
---
Yes, because thousands of people on 1 server will maintain 2 accounts while farming the same 9 spots.
---
I didn't mean to direct the comment to you specifically, just to everyone generally. I never did enjoy farming in un'goro though. Winterspring was always my jam.
---
Blizzard will kill it deader than BFA, make no mistake about that.
---
Take a look at Skarm’s Impale-Prot build for leveling, or just go straight up Arms if you want to PvP while leveling. It’s not necessary at all to be Prot to tank at low levels. Totally up to you and the playstyle you want from 1-59. Once you reach 60 though I woulda suggest a full Prot build or Impale-Prot build until you get real good gear.
---
Gotta be able to emergency re-format windows.
---
Also worried about the API. For instance, all /script macros are not allowed in combat
---
Verigians Fist at 20 is ridiculous.
---
A lot of people will have alts camped outside vendors that sell resources.
---
I have the same memories, but in Mulgore. That place was the shit, I loved Mulgore.
---
But, they are dungeons
---
World of warcraft classic feels more like the World of warcraft instead of the videogame of warcraft
---
I'm going to roll a shaman for my alt. I can't decide between elemental and a hybrid elemental/enhancement spec for leveling (I know in later levels I'll go for a 30/0/21 elemental build). I don't care overly much about leveling speed, but does anyone have any suggestions or considerations I might be overlooking (i.e. strengths, weaknesses, gear requirements) for which spec I should choose? 
---
The alt will be enchanting / leatherworking and my main will be tailoring / skinning, so I'll be able to craft up-to-date leatherworking gear as I go.
---
Whenever you fight any money ever, get married, miss, then dodges 13 times in a row while never getting enough rage to heroic strike. Around then probably.
---
I like your ways of thinking. 
---
Got a special copy of 7 with m2 drivers preinstalled in there to. You know, for safety reasons.  
---
I've been considering multiboxing just so I don't have to level up more than once.  
---
I wonder what the stigma will be like.  
---
I still think classic will be like a twink server. 
---
Does anyone know if meeting stones will be active on launch? 
---
Haha thanks!:D
---
nice b8 m8

---
I'm leaning on Tauren Shaman, may we have mother nature heed our call for help.
---
&gt;Do you all agree that is perfectly fine to tank while leveling with an arms build? What about thru the 5-10 mans
---
Yes. You will be able to tank just fine pretty much up til upper lvl 50 dungeons. You could probably do most level 60 dungeons as arms, depending on your parties skill/comp/gear. 
---
&gt;Any suggestions on trees that allow me to tank while leveling &amp; 5-10 mans and still be competitive PvP? 
---
Any leveling warrior build will be able to tank while leveling.
---
&gt;Should I just accept that it is impossible to be good enough at both PvP and tanking? i.e. inevitably I will have to make tradeoffs to be above average at both but not good enough at either to justify the middle ground
---
Unless you have a ton of gold to respec often, yes. Prot for 10 mans and raids is required to tank. Prot spec has 0 use in PVP besides AV. 
---
Wow! Awesome resource, thank you for taking the time to respond.
---
What professions should I take as a mage ? 
---
Yea drain life doesn't become good until around level 45-50 when you have some shadoweave gear and shadow mastery talent. After 50 I found drain life to be more efficient than wanding.

It's not really about fairness but for the sake of honor and to have a bit of a dignity. I wouldn't do things in video games that I don't feel like doing irl, and acting as a dick is an example
---
Yes. Many people will have one or two alts parked. Alts that they will need to take a break from their main to visit.
---
I will have 9.
---
I will also be able to visit each once every 5 minutes without impacting my normal play
---
There's quite a difference there.
---
Shaman only seem underrepresented because they're just available to horde.  Having like 5 or 6% of level 60 characters as shaman isn't the same thing as having 5 or 6% of level 60 characters as druids.
---
Among horde characters, shaman will probably be played more frequently than druids, about as frequently as priest, lock or hunter, and less frequently than warrior, rogue, or mage.
---
Now they are. But I’m Vanilla they were 10 man raids. Same as UBRS. They weren’t raids by definition back then but you still needed a raid to go in. They were where you went to gear up for MC. 
---
Thiiiiiiiis. 
---
I'm fairly certain all the dungeon set 2 armor (feral heart) is specific to each individual class. It also wont be available until after AQ40 comes out which will be well into Classic. 
---
Wisp is a fun little boost. Will it make a big difference? No, but it's something unique and you definitely notice it when you have to run back from a group wipe and you're the first back and have healed up before others even get back to their bodies.
---
It's just a phasing bug. Classic is going to exist in the same game world as retail, but be completely phased so people from Classic and retail don't know they're standing on top of each other.  
---
We'll see the occasional bug here and there where a random level 120 strolls past you in The Barrens.  
---
You should mention timezone
---
Maybe the AQ and Naxx events won't be slugfests either.
---
April 1st. Blizzard: "We can finally say that our Classic prank is now over! New expansion for mobile phone wow gameplay will now drop."
---
10g says that'll be the april fool's joke this year.
---
Elwynn Forest then Westfall for me just for Nostalgia. Cant wait to hit deadmines again. After that i will just go with the flow lol.
---
You are a bad person. 
---
Thrall was the one that sought peace between the factions and worked together with the Alliance. You might wanna go with Grom next time. 
---
Reposting because I was auto-purged for mentioning the name of a certain illicit server:  
---
Anybody remember how long, in minutes, it took to fly (taxi, gryphon) from THAT CHAPEL IN EASTERN PLAGUES to Booty Bay? I think that Rut'Theran to Cenarion Hold is about 12 minutes... roughly the same?
---
More
---
This is not the case. It’ll work how the PTR works, different servers, different content. They are NOT the same game world as retail has dozens of zones that don’t exist within classic, as well as the Cata revamp.
---
Everytime I listen to the original Legends of Azeroth track. It just feels me with all those feelings of exploration, mystery, and adventure. I guess it's because as a kid the game made a bigger impression on me than usual, so I can tie a lot of emotion to different aspects of the game, such as the music.
---
Thanks for the response! It has been a while since I played so I might be hazy on the order of difficulty, but so with a non-tank spec I could probably do Sunken Temple, BRD, LBRS, DM, but then for Strat, Scholy, UBRS, etc I'd need to go full tank spec?
---
Sorry buddy. I know you want me to be wrong, but I'm simply correct :(  
---
I know what they are, And I am old and might be forgetting, but I dont think they where 10 man. UBRS yes. But again.. I just don't recall that. Because we always 5 manned them.
---
Going to do some searching, cause now more questions are rising in my head. Like the Barron run.. and stuff like that.
---
Attack anyone that yields honor upon death.
---
Okay then I'll prepare myself to run/attack depending on my level everytime I see a red player :p 
---
But still, I won't lower myself to the level of idiots who gank lowbies just for "fun". You get nothing for it except ruining the others' game experience, it simply sucks
---
Started in vanilla and got hooked.  Played straight into BC and really enjoyed it.  Wrath was where it kind of dropped off.  I leveled to 80 and wasn't really feeling the general vibe.  I ended up making a DK and leveled it to 80 as well.  After that I steadily realized I was bored and called it quits.  I came back for a few months in Legion and mostly enjoyed it, just not quite enough to commit long term.  For me BC was the top of the hill.  I liked all the cool environments in outlands, especially exploring with flying mounts.  I got to make a shaman while staying alliance and it became my main for a good while.  My guild was much more successful at raiding than in vanilla.  All in all, the game was just more fun to me in vanilla and BC.
---
its not fun in a usual sense of the word, its rather painful and pushing through suffering, struggle and repetition and grind and boring stuff, overcoming the world, the circumstances, yourself, the enemies, the odds  and everything. being something more, than you.. maybe thats why  people like this game so much, and it stands out for them, and the experince they seeking. It feels rewarding, satisfying, immersive and addicting. not "fun".
---
Sometimes i'm thinking vanilla players are type of masochists. its fun, but in a special way :).
---
Pservers seem a little worse because they are global and there is never downtime for zones. When one country goes to sleep another is waking up. That being said some weirdos get a hard on for being a notorious dick who only logs in to gank people 30-40 levels under them in low level zones. It wont be a problem at first since everyone will be leveling, but in the future if you're gonna be making alts you will likely be ganked a few times. Redridge, Raven Hill Cemetary, and STV (specifically Nessingway's Camp) are the three most common I've noticed playing as Alliance. 
---
They were capped at 5 players in 1.10, so they will probably be only 5 man in Classic.
---
I enjoyed DH, but otherwise I see what you mean.  Coming back and finding out they replaced the original talent trees felt weird and wrong.
---
Get your facts straight OP  
---
Speaking of a tailor's guild, there was a guy on my old server back in Vanilla that had the only pattern for the rich purple shirt. He used that as a marketing tool to build a personal brand, and a lot of people bought his shirts.
---
It meant something to see the tag &lt;created by x&gt;. He was always on trade chat in IF selling his wares, telling jokes, and generally being a presence on the server.
---
Perhaps that could be a source of inspiration for you to draw from.
---
&gt; It's not really about fairness but for the sake of honor and to have a bit of a dignity. 
---
its a video game designed specifically around horde vs alliance conflict
---
i think you're overthinking this
---
It wasn't in classic so most likely not going to be in classic.
---
This is really awesome. Thanks for sharing! How does classicdb identify quest chains? Is there some kind of unique identifier that would allow users to sort by the entire chain?
---
Brewfest was added in BC, so that won't be there.
---
The following will most likely be in Classic:
---
**Feast of Winter Veil** - Added 1.2.0
---
**Noblegarden** - Added 1.3.0
---
**Children's Week** - Added 1.4.0
---
**Darkmoon Faire** - Added 1.6.0
---
**Harvest Festival** - Presumed to be added 1.6.0
---
**Hallow's End** - Added 1.8.0
---
**Lunar Festival** - Presumed to be added 1.9.0
---
**Love is in the Air** - Added 1.9.3
---
**Midsummer Fire Festival** - Added 1.11.0
---
We’ll be on the same server but in different phases so if you’re in stormwind  on a classic character you’ll be in vanilla stormwind but on the same server you can play a retail character in retail stormwind. You won’t be able to see or trade each other but if you’re on the same server you can send whispers 
---
It's a good idea, plus if you killed somebody and that person catches you later when you're in a weak position you might end up getting camped. So yes, I'll make sure to have a good karma ;)
---
At least. But so far their attention is: we don't want to release RPPvP at launch! How absurd is that?
---
Please, tweet and post on the official forums, even if brief. Every bit helps. Our voices have already done so much, loot trading, spell batching, content phases, etc.
---
I noticed this in Stonetalon Mountains yesterday. There's an escort with a Tauren chick being guarded in a tent by the baddies, yet every time she respawns to start the quest, they up and kill her.
---
Pretty sure you're right.  UBRS was 10, school and strat were 5, and I think LBRS was also 5.
---
It's not a drop
---
I heard a story here of an all Paladin guild that would defend people getting ganked and help lowbies with dungeons. Sounded ballin'. I'd like to do something similar with a guild of only healing priests that come to support Azeroth's champions in their quests.
---
Lol, so obnoxious your post got removed for just saying the name of a place ingame 
---
They're just pulling your leg.
---
Hey thanks for the great response man! You're totally right, we've been getting excited for the game lately and alot of the info we run into online right now is all about the fastest and optimal way to 60, but you're right, you definitely helped shift my perspective to just enjoy the game and the whole leveling experience, thanks!
---
All depends. Are you questing and willing to risk being ganked back and chance he will bring friends? Or just wave and hope you both mind each other's business 
---
Thank you for the advice :) Good to know that you can emote and try to communicate a bit with the opposite faction
---
what a relief!
---
Obviously. Good necro.
---
Yeah. It won't be as easy as lower level dungeons, but assuming your gear doesn't lag too far behind for you and your party definitely doable. You can give scholo and strat a chance. 
---
Essentially I would stay keep tanking as arms till at least 50, once you start having issues with wipes and such you can respec after that. A LOT is going to depend on multiple factors. Your group comp (do you have lots of CC? Polymorph, banish, sap, shackle, etc), are you an experienced tank, is your healer experienced, what gear you guys obtain while leveling(though you plan to 5 party dungeon, so all your gear should be up to par at 60 imo), etc. 
---
Why does this make me sad for the future?
---
this
---
Actually classic will just be one big timewalking event.
---
right in the feels
---
Kinda sucked as an Australian on NA servers, but mostly didn't worry about it at all
---
Another fun one was dual weild the Hakkar axes, life stealing on both, then the life steal valor set bonus, +bloodfury regen on attack 
---
I'm dad serious about this tbh.  
---
Elite = Leet = 1337 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
What does multi boxing mean? 
---
I rolled my eyes a little lol
---
Seems like the charm of wPvP is that you can't predict what's going to happen. At any moment you can get ganked by a rogue, then someone who passes by saves you, and that creates social cohesion and faction pride. Ofc it's probably not going to be that perfect but I'll be really excited to try it out :p
---
Thanks for the challenge. 
---
Ok.. here we go.  
---
They where in fact 10 man with patch 1.3. However, the quests where not raid quests.
---
Then as /u/Gorshun said they made the change to 5 in 1.10
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.3.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0)
---
&gt; **Dungeon Player Caps Edit**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches.  
---
&gt;With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:  
---
&gt;Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members  
---
&gt;Blackrock Spire - 15 members  
---
&gt;Dire Maul - 5 members   
---
&gt;***All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members***.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of thischange. In addition, will have their loot improved significantly for the next content patch. 
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.10.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0)
---
&gt; **High-Level Instance Changes Edit**  
---
&gt;Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. ***Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.*** 
---
I can already hear that stealth sound in my head
---
It doesn't matter if shamans are the most played healers, every warrior will drool over WF totem so you will always have a spot in any dungeon/raid.
---
You control two+ accounts/characters at the same time. Can be the same class or different, though I hear it's harder with different classes. You can set up macros/keybinds to control them seperately or together. 
---
For instance:
---
Imagine 3 warlocks running at you in AB, and suddenly you have 3 rows of debuffs and dots. Or one fears you and the others just DPS you. Etc.
---
i wouldnt bother either, i hate daylight irl so might aswell hate it ingame.
---
I would say rogue if you’re mainly interested in support for pvp. The best rogue players are the ones sneaking around taking care of objectives in battlegrounds (guarding flag in WSG / assaulting points in AB). As a mage you’ll usually be more on the front lines sheeping / counterspelling healers and attacking. 
---
I'm fine with overpreparing, there isn't anything innately wrong there. 
---
Your problem is probably with the content creators who are in an arms race to have covered every facet of the game. We have video guides for druid's bear form quest and Dartol's Rod of Transformation...
---
How do you see the fire to dodge it?
---
Probably, they were relatively useless in vanilla tho. It wasn't until TBC that they became useful and could summon people
---
wowhead says it's bind on pickup
---
They removed the rain?! what possible reason could there be to do that?  
---
I remember the 'weather patch', it was epic.
---
i got antsy in my pantsy and started playing on a private server the other day. i made a rogue and as soon as i had enough cache i bought a second dagger.
---
"you cannot equip that"
---
wtf do you mean i cant equip that?
---
no instant duel wield in classic. 
---
thats tier 1 (Felheart)
---
Same. My then girlfriend (now wife) went human priest. I was already Alliance, but having quit during the middle of WotLK and now fiend'ing for Classic, I asked her about faction and she said she wanted to do human priest again, so...
---
Because 2D rain looks like shit. Idk if epic is the word for it. 
---
Jeez. I didn't know their was a white knight class in WoW. That's pathetic man. Glad you got your mount. And yeah that's how this report system could be abused for sure
---
it'll be fun for ppl who like it. 
---
but i agree that, all these ppl claiming they gonna play classic, won't even get to 60. i mean shroud, summit etc. i gurantee you, these guys VASTLY understimate how hardcore classic is.
---
they play for a week and give up. maybe come back to it few time in a month time. so he is right about those.
---
i expect soda to get 60, cos he's hardcore and got ps experience. not even sure asmon will get it, i can easily see him giving up in mid 40s. saying its just boring, stupid and he not feeling it and so on. but well he prolly get carried as usual and get to 60 eventually.
---
think about it lvl 44 is a half point. and lvl55 to 60 takes a much time as 1 to 30 level.
---
This is awesome! Thanks for sharing. Does the Quest Chain field also identify when a quest is unlocked by completing another? I'm thinking of quests that aren't part of the chain, but become available after one is completed. 
---
It's an april fools joke from the deja character stats addon I believe.
---
and also on the screens 
---
True. I feel like chatting is so censored now but that's more of a cultural shift that's present in America now. We used to shoot the shit but now people are much more cautious with their words. Not just in video games
---
Those are all possible and really sweet ideas. It all depends on if you have enough people willing to dedicate to the idea!
---
This is really pretty neat, thx a lot! Gonna use this in comb with  joanas guides. And vote this dude's post up, he deserves it for sharing his work!
---
I saw an SSD for 29$. Kingston. Not very fast but still faster than HDD. 
---
Sounds about right as I quit pretty quickly after AQ was completed.
---
Still, I would't do to others what I don't want done to myself. And if we are going this far, Alliance values are based around justice, Horde's values are all about honour, so it doesn't make sense to attack the weak
---
Tailoring for bloodvine and Engineering 
---
That gives my stomach a sinking feeling.  Don't know the dragon or anything about that... but I feel for you.
---
Blame the devs for the system they implemented that gimps Warrior gold, and allows paladin healers to roll on tank gear. 
---
Vendor money was needed from DPS pulls and healers rolling on my gear.
---
Sweet, thanks :)
---
Well it depends on what spec you are playing, you said group pvp so I assume resto. Because thats the best group pvp spec. And in that case it's stam/intellect. The tier 1 and tier 2 sets are both ideal for this, just look at their stats.
---
Classic NA player forgetting timezone. 
---
Looking for CST players.
---
retail still has night based on server time
---
Ah it must have happened after I switched to Horde. Back when I was Alliance I got as far as ZG. I remember UBRS, Scholo, and Strath being 10 mans because that’s how you got .5 sets. Now that I look at the tier sets I see that they’re called Dungeon sets. It has been 14 years or so since I raided in Classic after all. 
---
I swear retail still had rain, it just lasts 30 seconds.
---
just watched all your lore videos. loved them!! subbed and excited for more
---
That depends what you want out of your professions.
---
If you go  hardcore, Tailoring + Engineering is fine.
---
If you want to go casual, taking Skinning + (Mining or Herbalism) might make most sense.
---
If you enjoy levelling your profession and want to be somewhat self-proficient, Tailoring + Skinning or Alchemy + Herbalism works.
---
If you never want to have money again, Tailoring + Enchanting is a nice combo.
---
Pretend to be friendly until they're in a tough situation , that's when you show up and gank them. Like if they pull a group of mobs. Justify it to yourself as really needing those mobs for your quest and the opposite faction guy slowing you down. It was his fault really, you'd be there forever if you had to compete for spawns, right?
---
I’ll probably rock a 29 or 39 Druid at some point :). 
---
There are 3 kinds of player mentalities in the open world(of warcraft): 
---
1) Griefers.
---
2) The pacifists.
---
3) The honorable.
---
1- Red is dead is their motto, will kill anything that belongs to the opposite faction, regardless of level/situation or location, often ganking in groups if they feel they aren't strong enough to kill solo, these players are always the source of grief on forums and surprisingly occupy a large portion of the population on both factions.
---
2-  Won't attack anyone who doesn't attack them first ,unless they see someone from the opposite faction ganking someone much lower level than them or someone stealing their herbs/ore, in that case they go nuts, pacifists are found much less often than griefers and are often referred to as female cats.
---
3- 1v1 fair wpvp, never ganks anyone below their level, never attacks a player who is fighting a mob or isn't full hp/mana , never interfere's with other people's 1v1s so long as they are deemed fair , is often the better skilled player who engages multiple people of their level at the same time to prove themselves, battle hardened tacticians who seek the thrill of defeating equal level opponents at their prime and anyone that tries to grief them ends up running to their corpse soon after. These types of players are far and few , the biggest minority of them all.
---
Hopefully widescreen support will be better in Classic. Get yourself a good UI and it's not bad at all being a healer.

The link above is probably from a private server but is definitely better than trying to fit healing on a 17" 1024x800 monitor.
---
If you're looking to play on an RP-PvP server I invite you to join &lt;Orc Forge&gt;. We too plan to do a lot of WPvP.

That being said, making 4 to 5 levels in Scarlet Monestary is very authentic, at least on Horde side.

Similar here. I wouldn't exhausted, because I'd get my sleep regardless, but for that I'd shift my day/night cycles by living at night and sleeping throughout the day. Obviously I can't do that anymore on non-weekend days outside of holidays, because I'd lose my job these days, but even when I can get away with it, I don't. I've grown out of that type of chaotic lifestyle. Living at night f\*cks with you mentally in more ways than one. Not to mention that such a lifestyle forces you to give up other stuff that you'd want as well.

Playing \~3 hours a night for 2 months vs attending every raid for months only to see 7 pieces on priest tier drop. All of them are pants.
---
49 bracket is where it’s at!
---
damn thats Epic lol
---
leet and epic, anyone get it lol? 1337? looks like leet
---
I tried useing DKP and it don't really work very effcient. I don't really like the idea of just showing up gives DKP. Often I found that in vanilla  dkp guilds will be missing pre-raid bis gear/ pots/ enchants. 
---
And most people who are dedicated will leave for a more fair system, like loot council
---
And a good one at that
---
yeah before people constantly named themselves after mumble rap and narcotics. Us gamers will never get this.
---
Hah! Exactly.
---
What did it cost?
---
Everything...  Nobody invites me to raids :P. 
---
Ahhh gotcha, I completely forgot when they were made useful. I remember them being kind of like a LFG system
---
You should atleast mention what class you're going to play, hard to tell you like this
---
lul
---
Because you think you do, but you don't. 
---
That's the mindset. We're getting the BARE MINIMUM from Blizz on Classic. They don't think anyone will play on an RP-PVP server and it'll be dead in a week and they can't really merge that because which do you merge to? RP or PVP? 
---
This is ALWAYS a problem with subs that start growing, the karma farmers come in and it's not even worth browsing anymore.
---
Something needs to be done eventually.
---
my body isn't rdy
---
no play mage 
---
Stay in PvP spec all the time if your just doing dungeon and not raiding. You can tank all dungeons and a few raids in any spec you want.
---
What a dirty bastard he is.
---
I included those as part of the chain.  Generally speaking, if something unlocks because another quest is completed, its included as part of the chain.

Why does the druid have to be a healer for 5 mans? druids tank 5 man phenomenally well and their utility isn't anything to sneeze at.
---
Blacklist is starting early, boys.
---
What is wrong with that opinion?  They're bad parents.
---
Would be keen to see such a post. I believe they were asked about balancing at both Blizzcon Classic panels, both times saying they have no intention of doing any such thing.
---
From my memory, as a horde warrior, 46-49ish since I ran out of quest and the same at 58ish, when I also ran out of quests. I did meet two great friends out of it though, doing the same thing, we kept each other up all night group grinding until we were all 60.

you aren't gonna get r14 as spriest sorry

I think even that is an understatement, *most* people never raided. When my guild startet raiding back in the game, we were the third guild on Horde, fifth on realm to raid MC. The first was already at Nefarian. (This was in Europe, so we had 2 and half month less between MC and BWL.) As I recall, this was more or less typical for a medium pop realm (i.e. queues only on the weekends)
---
I'm really looking forward to see how this changes in Vanilla, where more people might have the view that raid content is core content.

Wow, epic! Upvoted because classic, and a classic fan myself I Love this content!
---
Yes, when WSG first dropped. It ended up crashing the server.
---
They forgot to mention you can get rep with each BG faction which comes with their own PVP rewards, which are pretty good compared to the rank rewards.
---
Feels like many people are influenced by retail and think locks are godmode , wonder how long it will take for most to realize otherwise :p
---
I mean sure they're a good class, but I bet you anything once they realize how op mages are they'll be rerolling in droves.
---
A way to know wich realm to play on before it turns into a 20/80 faction ratio? 
---
I don’t know a thing how old realms worked and I’m only familiar with cross-realm. I remember when I just started playing I started talking to a fellow nooby but when we wanted to add friends we could not because it said (...) behind his name :(
---
I just want to make sure or low pop factions on certain realms were a problem and or there is any way to avoid it. 
---
Nothing economically focused but I was in a guild before called Stampede that was all animal based classes, so only druids, hunters, and after a vote, shamans were allowed due to the ghost wolf technicality. 
---
I wanted those maces so bad on my shaman. I don't even remember why. Probably for the pre patch for TBC
---
Again, top 1%
---
In terms of current wow, thats most mythic raiders. And 90% of the time, its still going to come down to mechanics. (unless you are literally going for world 1-10)
---
Some good did come out of it, you donut.
---
Yes, there was a terrible amount of bad and evil, but also good.  You must remember that every situation that could ever happen has a silver lining.  If you can't realize that then you've got a lot of wisdom still yet to gain.

The holocaust provided us with a tremendous amount of medical and technical knowledge.  The amount we as a world learned from the tremendous evil that took place is nothing short of miraculous.  You could almost make the argument that at some point in our history, an event like the holocaust NEEDED to happen.  It's not really a matter of good and evil, but given the way humans tend to tribalize themselves, this event was necessary.  We should be happen it happened BEFORE we had essentially perfected the war machine.  Imagine if the holocaust, or a similar event, happened after we had designed nuclear weapons.  Imagine if it had happened after we had a vast knowledge of chemical warfare.  I'm simply making the argument that it was inevitable that at some point on the timeline of a humanity, a powerful nation would rise up and alienate a specific group of people, and then attempt to exterminate them.  It has been happening on the small scale for all of human history.  We're lucky it happened so early.  The entire world was made aware of what happens when regime's such as the Nazis, rise to power and are left un-contained.  Now that it has happened, the whole world is more sensitive and aware of what can be released upon this world if no one is watching.  Yes, 6 million or so people died.  Yes, thats horrible.  If that type of event were to happen today, the deaths would have been in the hundreds of millions.
