On the plus side, idiots are likely to attack a super well-geared druid without knowing their peril and smart players will hold back attacking druid because they can't tell at a glance how powerful they are.  Besides, nice looking gear is mostly for standing around SW or OR in human form showing off the bling.

&gt;Reckoning Bombs. 
---

---
Even if it will be limited to 5 hits total, reck bombs are still going to be a thing in Classic, right?
---
I already remember the way in the barrow dens in night elf starting zone.
---
And, I even remember some of the quest texts...

Greetings. I am conservator Ilthalaine. My purpose in Shadowglen is to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained.
---
The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest beasts to flourish, while others suffered. Unfortunately, the nightsaber and thistle boar populations grew too large. Shadowglen can only produce so much food for those beasts.
---
Journey forth, young Druid, and thin their numbers, so the balance can be preserved.

I had so many great memories pre bc and during bc for that matter. Here is context for the time. worked in a popular cyber cafe at the time, would work 14 hour days every day. Didn't feel like working because I just played wow and DotA with my best friends all day lan. Most of my friends were top tier gamers, two on pro SC/wc3 players guy who ended up selling brutal gladiator title every season in the future, guy with 100% bis items in all vanilla and bc, including thunderfury, warglaives. I was not quite on their level but in very respectable guilds during the whole game basically. Anyway, on to your question, my favorite things was building my paladin to be the best healer, possible. For example near the announcement of details of TBC, it was revealed that raids wouldn't be 40man anymore, which made many hardcore guilds break up into smaller factions of players. As a result many of my guildies stopped logging in for raid, instead of 40 for naxx, we would have 18 people ready... So we just started selling runs in t1.  People would pay tons of gold for boss kills and a gaurentee of a few epics, meanwhile my tank/gm is casually tanking all zg/mc/aq20 with his two hander, topping DPS haha. It was great. We would que for wsg on our pvp day and he would cap flag with my accompanying as his primary healer and literally 5-6 people would attempt to stop him, only to be shattered, most of the time without needing anything more than blessing of freedom. Another was playing on the same server with at least 30 people you know in real life. We were bored so we would get drunk and have a few 5 man's together to collect mats or gear an alt. Mind you, with 4x full t2 people... It isn't like you can die haha. Or if somebody was being a dick, we would casually walk by their toon to find out exactly where he/she was, then proceed to spawn camp him and pretend we have no idea what's going on. Before you ask, yes we almost all had multiple accounts.  So many great memories, I can't wait for classic to launch again, it's literally been haunting my dreams.
---
Like Anakin, you will bring balance to the force... by murdering the young.
---
I'm guessing you haven't played retail lately.  Every single class feels like a reskin of several others with the exception of maybe demonhunter and disc priest
---
&gt; Blizz has been as of late
---
Regarding state of WoW, it's coming back to the Classic state more, if anything. I literally don't get how people from this sub actually hop on the hate train, other than being peer pressured and hive-minded.
---
Ion is a big vanilla WoW fan and old-school raider.
---
You don't like long grinds, relying on RNG to item drops and not having "unique" legendary weapon as everyone else and their mothers? You don't like class identity over spec identity? I guess ***you don't like the direction WoW is going but you actually won't enjoy classic at all then.***
---
These are actually big concepts in Classic.
---
4k is awesoe for coding! You can see huge part of code at same time(less scroll needed) and you can handle multiple system windows.
---
Coding and painting req huge screens. 
---
For gaming full HD(1080) is enough.
---
[removed]
---
I would say it is highly unlikely.
---
That said, changes to respec costs seem to be amongst the most common #changes made on pirate servers so there's clear evidence that such #changes are popular with that crowd and do not lead to the end of the world, the total breakdown of class identity or mass hysteria.
---
I think the core problem is that there ought to be a price to be paid in order to go hardcore in PvE and PvP at the same time, so there needs to be some kind of barrier there. But at the same time it's really bad that to be a PvE healer or tank you basically have to give up your ability to do anything else well, while still needing to farm for raid consumables and repairs,  while the DPS classes get to have it all.
---
In my unattainable perfect world, PvE healers and tanks could dual spec to something they could farm with, but DPSers would have to pay if they wanted to respec.
---
Agreed. The problem is, the bigger the screen, the bigger you need XÐ
---
Ah i see. There just isn't anything interesting to do outside of raiding in BFA right now, thats my opinion at least.
---
Okay then you’re also okay with changing population caps in response to population trends?
---
I’m with you - I’ve bought a lot of games recently that just haven’t been hitting the spot. Enjoyable, for sure, but nothing that truly resonates with me.
---
So I’ve been watching an unhealthy amount of YouTube videos about Classic the past couple of months. I’m even re-watching some and not caring. I’m tempering quality expectations slightly to avoid a chance for disappointment but it still really can’t come soon enough.
---
Can we really complain about gutted classes on a classic subreddit?
---

---
What is there in vanilla ?
---
Yeah, sure, game developers design content for it not to be done. Makes total sense. Briliant, what a genius feature.
---
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Well, if arguments fail you can always sreech "go play retail" I guess. 
---
Druid, Mage, Warrior, Warlock, Rogue have the best 1 vs x potential. Strictly 1v1 Druids are arguably the best class. If you are talking 1 vs x I think your most likely option is mage.
---
they disband after the first drop when the hunter rolls on the + healing pants.
---
yup no issue at all with either of those 
---
I think alot of people are having a nostalgic view of Vanilla raiding since it happen before 1.12. 
---
On pservers with 1.12 MC, BWL and especially ZG is pug material from scratch and guild alt-runs with a few reserved items on weekend. 
---
If you want to raid you have two options in my opinion. 
---
1. You join a casual guild and do dungeons and ubrs+raids on weekends, maybe joins a few pugs. You will clear some content but its a bumpy ride. 
---
2. You join a semi-hc guild. You are expected to arrive prepared on what to do and with plenty of buffs. Instead you stomp the content in one night (even &lt;2hrs) and get the best gear. 
---
Personally I prefer option 2. In the end its not that much more time spent but more efficiently if you are prepared. 
---
Patch 4.0.1, old world but new client. Anyone got experience?
---
Sooooooo true, I've hired a babysitter in advance for day's I'm off but my wife works so I can raid XD
---
It's a buff to Mend Pet.
---
I did something like this the first time I played WoW I never played another MMO and went Diablo 2 -&gt; WoW so even rolling was a new experience. I didnt understand Soulbound at all and thought my warlock could maybe someday learn to use an Axe and needed a Taskmaster Battle Axe in Deadmines.
---
It's not slippery slope, people will literally bring friends to pugs to roll on gear for them. It's going to happen.
---
You're one of these limp-wristed betas that's going to let classic be ruined because you, for some unknown reason, actually trust Activision-Blizzard.
---
You do have a phone, right?
---
better look down or you'll get 2fps
---
“Just tough it out”
---
“Tough what out you moron I’m dead!”
---
DM:E farm as soon as it’s released literally creates gold from thin air.
---
Get a Mage to 60 and max herbalism before Diremaul release (fuck Blizzard if DM is included at launch... that means I’d have to rush 60 and max herb without casually enjoying my leveling experience)
---
My plan is to farm enough gold early on to have me set into a possible WotLK server
---
But it was never better in classic so people kind of shouldn't expect it to be better xD 
---
that happens to all highrate servers, and most x1ones
---
Also, on pservers, nobody does that Ómen for Lunar Festival - because that "what will it give me no epics, no gold, so why?" attitude
---
he did say "most"
---
Yeah because you either have 1) a few specs that are useless or 2) every class is the same. Right. No in-between.
---
/s
---
Hint : TBC Class balance was better than Vanilla. No one spoke back then about how classes feel the same.
---
Unless you want to spend 1 hour trying to kill 5 wolves, because 200 other people are killing them also, sharding will be necessary in the starting areas.
---
incels downvoting is lulsy
---
Well in vanilla mazing out professions required a lot more time and effort than newer xpacs.  
---
Are you new to the world of warcraft? The whole concept of the game is the player can do whatever they want and there is no linear path to follow..
---
Ish'Nulah weary traveler?

That is not really a fun end game activity. It’s not social at all. If I want to grind single player , I play darksouls instead

People sometimes don’t even realize that Druid’s are around taking care of dispel duty as well. Druid’s have dispel curse which will piss off any warlock, hibernate which is a kind of proactive dispelling of pets, and abolish which will piss off rogues. I think Alliance has a bit of an edge in that a well geared Paladin and Druid basically can’t be killed and can just run around dispelling and healing to their hearts contents.
---
Vanilla has less content then BFA. So if your asking what is in Vanilla. The answer is compared to modern wow... Not much. That being said very few people on classic servers ever complain about content. The reason is pretty simple.
---
In BFA you can play like you are playing COD. Solo que into everything then quick grind it out. So when you are done your stuff. You are done so what happens? You get bored and, bitch for content.
---
In classic wow this is not an issue because you can't solo que or get everything done on your own. That means you will be helping other people with their "content" as well as doing your own. It makes the content go much further. All of the grinding also seems like less of a chore because you have to meet people and, be friendly so they continue to show up and, help you in the future.
---
Read rule 4. Oh, and rule 1. Maybe a little rule 2 if you have the time.
---
Really bfa has ques for arena rbg and mythic raiding and mythic + ? I don’t need to join a community anymore to play it ? I resub now 
---
It _did_ strike me as odd when I first started playing that here I am a druid being asked by druids to run around slaughtering wildlife.
---
Only people who love Activision-Blizzard are allowed to display any interest in Classic WoW.
---
This. Less is essentially more if you are willing to put down day and time. 
---
The problem with Druid is that it has trouble with classes with high burst potential. If a mage, Warrior, or rogue incapacitate you, you can run away and try to heal, but if they get two or even three cracks at you, it can become almost impossible to pull it back. Especially mages as sitting in bear form while you get mauled can at least help somewhat, whereas a mage who PoM Pyros you has you dead to rights.
---
The fact is that basically every class is quite competent one on one. They all have strengths and weaknesses and the best players compensate where they can and take their lumps where they have to. 
---
Overall I’d say I fear the pet classes the most because every battle is 2 v 1. Hunters especially are annoying with their traps and slows. That’s not determinative of course.
---
The rogue does cause they are all crybabies if they don't get everything. Good thing rogues are easily replaceable and provide no support in 5 mans. Some rogues are really good but 99% of them are worse than huntards.
---

What use would it be to relist popular and topical criticisms which you even admit yourself to being aware of? They are common knowledge (and therefore don't necessitate citation) and your only goal is to muddy the waters by getting into specifics, with the intent of avoid the main issue of the thread (the merits of trust or the lack thereof in Activision-Blizzard). 
---
This is the irony of people such as yourself who are quick to call "troll" - the sorts of argumentative tactics you engage in are completely anathema to constructive discussion. 
---
what vanilla server isnt on patch 1.12?
---
Y'all are cray. I'm definitely going to toggle on the old graphics to drown myself in nostalgia for a day or two but then I'm definitely switching to the newer graphics
---
you're an incel
---
So no changes except for the changes you're okay with?
---
&gt; I don't care about your damn meta that developed on your pserver or your top guild back then. I really don't care. My experience, and many others experience was different.
---
You're pretty naive if you think Classic is going to be any different. 
---
But anyways I hope you find the people you'd like to play with :)
---
More like this, I like this. This is good.
---
I know you are being sarcastic but, it kinda feeds into my point. Those are the only aspects of BFA that might make you want to form a group. Slogging through the alone and, isolated just to get to that light. Isn't gonna do it for most people.
---
Keep in mind too that leaves absolutely no group play for anyone who is even 3% casual. I'm not here to shit on BFA. If people like it good on them but, that is why classic wow players dis like it. You spend almost all your time alone with nothing to do.
---
&gt; That is obviously not what they intended, so this is disingenuous.
---
No, it's not disingenuous, it's just pointing out an alternative. Calling me disingenuous is, in fact, disingenuous.
---
&gt; Snowflakes always seem to think they are terribly special and unique for playing something bad, and anyone who is not terribly impressed with their "creativity" must be an intrinsically boring and closed-minded person.
---
I _know_ I'm not terribly special.
---
&gt; There is a time and a place for everything. There are loads of single-player games and skill-based games where you can dress up however you like and take on whatever handicap you like and more power to you.
---
Right back at you. There is a game with lots of Warcraft themed specs where each one is good at raiding. Classic isn't the time and place because it's a restoration of a different game.
---
&gt; A gear-based MMORPG where your contribution to a group matters a lot to other people's experiences and where what you are doing is simply mathematically bad seems like a weird place to try to express that kind of creativity.
---
Then turn the numbers off and don't look at them.
---
&gt; And a deeply weird place to get this deep sense of entitlement you obviously have that you are owed the ability to do this, and that this entitlement is much more important than the desires of people who want to play the same class and be useful in PvE.
---
I feel no entitlement. Whatsoever. For raiding guilds, there's a _tension_ between the good of the group and what players might want to do. That's part of the game. Some guilds will need to be strict about a lot of things in order to meet their goals. Others will want to get a bunch of people together and have fun. There's room in the world for everybody.
---
&gt; This is at best a half-truth. Raiding is the endgame.
---
It doesn't _have_ to be. At. All. An endgame for me might be to level one character of each class to 60. Or to clear Naxx as a resto druid in a hardcore guild, then switch my focus to kitting out a balance set. You're making an assertion about the game that only pertains to players who approach it the way you do.
---
&gt; Read the OP again, genius. They were asking about PvE raid comps. That is the topic.
---
Again, I offered an alternative. There is nothing wrong with that, no matter how much my alternative upsets you or offends you.
---
&gt; It's not some weird kind of entitlement for someone who levelled their paladin smashing evil with a big hammer to want to smash evil with a big hammer in Naxxramas.
---
That's subjective. The original Vanilla team would flat out disagree with you, here, and it is _their_ game that Blizzard is restoring.
---
&gt; Seriously, would it really make your butt all that sore to have to find a different way to suck?
---
It would suck for the only way to play Vanilla to be to roll on a crappy private server with huge latency run by criminals.
---
Would it really make _your_ butt all that sore to play Vanilla again as it was, _warts and all_?
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
The worst part is that sharding is essentially non-destructive, smart realm merging/splitting in realtime. 
---
Would you get dazed if hit from behind and/or below the 4 stam 4 strength leather belt?
---
The Spirit of the Kekistani thrives in my server
---
the term you want to use is "semi-hardcore"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It describes guilds who still expect min/max play from their members, but only raid on a strict (typically shorter) schedule.  something like 2-3 days a week, 2-4 hrs a night.
---
There are already quite a few talented groups playing 2 days, 3 hrs each and clearing most Mythic raids.  Also the semi-hardcore guilds tend to compete quite well with the other "serious" guilds out there.  
---
While semi-hardcore will rarely get server firsts due to their relaxed schedule, they almost always clear all content due to the skill level of the players.
---
Really it all depends on the spec, gear/server progression. If I had to bet my savings on a 1v1 dueling tournament I am taking Druid almost every time in classic.
---
I think you did not play retail in a long time. People group for everything from doing Herold of the titans , warfronts rare groups , bounty hunter and so on. Even casuals do most of the time atleast low mythic +. 
---
And since the community feature got introduced you are one click away to always having groups. 
---
The only difference is. No one can force you to play with people you dislike since their is with cross realm always a alternative 
---
I'll be on 9-12 pacific time most nights. We can be stoner wow friends. 
---
I remember the day of pre-patch for BFA. Just your average day in Orgimmar on WRA..
---
**When Suddenly the Alliance attacked!**
---
It couldnt have been more than 30 people going around and slaughtering NPCs and anyone that tried turning warmode on. 
---
BFA which was to focus Alliance vs. Horde
---
BFA which was bringing some attention to world pvp.
---
Day 1 of pre-patch and it could barely handle these 30 people romping around Orgimmar. It wasnt even frame lag either it was straight up *dude running in place for 20 seconds just to suddenly be on the  other side of the zone*
---
Certainly framed what BFA was going to be like.
---
No. I’ve played since vanilla. When blizzard sets a time it will be there. Especially for this one. It would be a massive error on their part to delay it. When was the last time an expac was delayed? 
---
As someone who played BFA very sparingly and at low levels recently, I am 100% positive that the reason the game sucks is because there is no challenge and no danger. I was a level 4 priest and I was able to kill two level 10 boars at the same time, it was fucking absurd. If you even fart in the general direction of a mob three levels above you in classic, they will be wearing your kidneys as earrings.
---
It’s ironic in a sense that Asmongold has recently started playing Dark Souls and his fans have been requesting it because DS is the diametric opposite of WoW. DS is a relentless and ruthless game that rewards skill, ingenuity, patience, and prudence. From everything I’ve seen of BFA, that couldn’t be further from the truth.
---
I never said that. You said you moved on ten years ago when that’s laughably false 
---
I'm skeptical of playing Classic WoW after everything Blizzard has done this year.  
---
Could you spawn poison clouds to force players into the center of the play area?

---
Do you think it will be that different? 
---
Vanish removing hunters mark is huge! 
---
Bleeds scaling better with attack power isn’t. 
---
What else changed?
---
I stopped playing after Cata for the reason I stated. I think you hit the nail on the head with the "force" line though. A large portion of wows fan base. I would even dare to say the lion share of wows fan base is pretty heavily introverted. The old game forced you to play together and, have fun. The new game does not. You can play together but, for the most part you don't have to. 
---
Also to be clear when I say party up or play together. I am including the use of words. Not just queing up and, being in a silent party. Which was the norm when I quit. 
---
Lol it's a joke, but if you've played since Vanilla you might remember that "soon" was a meme, and they NEVER hit their deadlines 
---
Ive played on rppvp server without battlenet or transmog on defias brotherhood. Was nothing like you suggest. I hope you are wrong.
---
Oh boy where do I start?
---
It’s in the like northern most part of searing gorge iirc 
---
rofl. enh shaman is so bad they can slowly walk towards people and fish for windfury procs. ele is much better.
---
Can you elaborate more on number one? Why would that happen? 
---
What makes you think I've cared about WoW since then, other than your own bizarre projection? I started following the development Classic WoW because it's a game I liked from my childhood and they are bringing it back.
---
Again, what are you finding so confusing about this?
---
Hate Bread. 
---
I’m not sure how popular this was but I don’t think it will be back. 
---
We used it on ninja looters mostly. 
---
Get people in your guild to help. You all buy cheap bread from the inn keeper and send it to a person in singles. We would routinely get 8-12 people to mail 2 stacks worth to a person and they’d have to manually remove each piece of bread from their mailbox. 
---
You would do it on an alt and delete the character after lol. 
---
Some great times lol 
---
&gt; Right back at you. There is a game with lots of Warcraft themed specs where each one is good at raiding. Classic isn't the time and place because it's a restoration of a different game.
---
OP was asking how it could be changed so that more specs would be viable in endgame raiding. Sorry if OP started a thread about a topic that does not interest you, but you don't need to threadcrap all over it just because it is not for you.
---
&gt; Then turn the numbers off and don't look at them.
---
We've gone beyond the mere stupidity of "lol everything about this deterministic computer game is just a matter of opinion" and into the true idiocy of "if you close your eyes the numbers in the computer game don't exist".
---
&gt; I feel no entitlement. Whatsoever.
---
A minute ago you were whining about how selfish people were for wanting offspecs to be viable in raids, because it would spoil the fun you thought you would have by playing them in raids and sucking balls.
---
&gt; It doesn't have to be. At. All.
---
Here is a complete list of ways to kit yourself out in a full set of AQ40-equivalent purples or better without raiding:
---
&gt; Again, I offered an alternative. There is nothing wrong with that, no matter how much my alternative upsets you or offends you.
---
The OP decides what the topic is. If you really think the world needs a discussion about a different topic you can go start your own thread titled "DAE enjoy playing failed specs in endgame PvE so much that they don't want them fixed?".
---
&gt; That's subjective. The original Vanilla team would flat out disagree with you, here, and it is their game that Blizzard is restoring.
---
Actually we have Word Of God from multiple vanilla designers that they wanted every spec to be viable and they failed to achieve this. So if you really want to fulfil the desires and vision of the OG designers you should support class revisions to achieve that.
---
Let me guess: Suddenly you no longer GAF about what the vanilla designers intended.
---
&gt; It would suck for the only way to play Vanilla to be to roll on a crappy private server with huge latency run by criminals.
---
But your goal is just to be a special snowflake by deliberately playing a PvE raider who is bad, right? Why do you have to have Blizzard hand that to you on a platter for you to mindlessly follow? I am *sure* there will be some way to deliberately suck in PvE raiding in Classic whether or not they fix the broken specs.
---
&gt; Would it really make your butt all that sore to play Vanilla again as it was, warts and all?
---
OP asked about how it could be changed to make it better in a specific way. That is the thread topic. What did you expect people to talk about?
---
Yeah Paladins are a VERY boring solo class, group play is much more engaging.  On the other hand, you can easily watch shows or movies while leveling a paladin with very little effect on gameplay!
---
I'd like to think yes, or some debuff that shrinks you 20% and reduces strength. 
---
On that note too, truck nuts should do +10 stamina, -10 int. 
---
Keep trying to make yourself believe devs actually create and put many hours of work into content that's actually not intended to be played. Maybe one day it will work. 
---
Don't lie, you enjoyed it.
---
As you balance out some things other things get messed with. 1.12 Had very well balanced PvP, you can think of situations where every spec shines. So everyone's viable somewhat in raids, but PvP was balanced and more importantly interesting, every class feeling unique. (Which got lost around WotLK sometime.) There was also something like karmic balance in the game. Warriors were tough to level and tough to get to pre-raid bis, but after that they were kingly. Hunters were easy to level, very viable in early raids, but become nearly useless in the later raids. Mages and Warlocks have it easy the whole time, but are boring to raid as. etc
---
Lel, that's amazing
---
You basically have to work as rsham, but priest have it ezpz. For example, as a guild leader, any sham you recruit will almost positively at some point want to respec dps. Then you don't want to be an ass and say ehhhhhh I'd rather just recruit another rogue, mage, lock, hunter... So you let them raid offspec, they pull the boss and everyone hates you. Versus, priests, even if they want to dps, shadow isn't pulling ag haha... So there's still some benefit without much effort... Idk, argument both ways but priest is better for healing hands down.
---
Hell in vanilla I would get killed by something my own level occasionally if the wrong RNG of misses or enemy crits rolled out lol
---
You utterly just proved my point with so much redundant vernacular that was obviously pulled from the thesaurus.
---
But here it is - you are complaining about a gaming company on the internet within a community that enjoys (albeit with all prior criticisms pointed out) their game. You are also doing so without being a single sensible argument other than “come on, you know all their issues...”
---
The only difference you can truly make is not to buy their product.  Cause your simply trolling
---
If it's 100% authentic classic then blizzard stock may actually uptick.
---
Source is me on Guldan Demonsoul and Auchindoun (Auchindoun was technically BC launch though)
---
&gt; which level is the most efficient to kill
---
Yellow mobs, always. Preferably squishy, low HP humanoids between +1/-1 your level. 
---
Warrior types and high HP/high-armor beasts like bears and turtles are bad for XP/HR.
---
unless you are a priest and just hang out by the elevators. Mind control is awesome.
---
The first two were things that were changed. Reck bombs now have a limit and don't stack infinitely, and the weapon swap rogue one was a bug where you could have a 2.8sp weapon equipped and weapon swap/ambush at the same time and ambush with that really hard hitting 2.8sp weapon causing waaaay more damage than it should.
---
I dont think I've ever been this excited for a game in years. These next 5-8 months are going to feel like the longest I'll ever wait.. I feel like a little kid waiting for Christmas lol 
---
I remember the Alliance having significantly shorter queues than the Horde in BC. Not sure about vanilla.
---
The whole "shut up and speak with your money" conceit can really be shortened to "shut up" - because it's always used to silence criticism. Of course, if you don't buy the game then the same fan will accuse you of being unqualified to pass judgement by virtue of not owning the game. It's all circular!
---
If you don't want any criticism of Activision-Blizzard on this subreddit then take it up with the owner, not me. Because as far as I'm aware it's not against the rules to not be a fanboy yet. Maybe Activision-Blizzard will start paying the mods and you'll get your way though. We'll see!
---
I'm thinking of doing either that or using the Dalaran crater pink bubble wall
---
As someone who missed out on playing WoW years ago, I am excited to try this out. Any advice for a complete noob? 
---
Then the tank wins the roll.      ITs fOr fUrrY bRo!

Not roughly the same damage output, but same viability for dps slots. In theory, the classes with less dps would bring a unique utility, and you can see some attempts at this in design - feral 3% crit, moonkin 3% spell crit, sanctity aura, vampiric embrace. In practice, these buffs aren't critical and only justify a one-of even if they are.
---
They never really solved this issue, either. It felt better in 10- and 25-man raids, where a one-of was good representation for any spec. They also handed out 'unique utilities' like candy. Every spec had something: mana regen, crit buff, or a debuff for bosses.
---
The problem was an intense amount of overlap between the classes on these buffs, part of their "bring the player not the class" philosophy. You needed a frost mage **or** a shadow priest, and the lesser of the two shortly found themselves no longer viable.
---
If not for that overlap between classes, it would have been the best balanced version of WoW. Every single spec had something unique to bring to the table, and there was no "meme-spec" because you really couldn't go wrong with a one-of anything. The retadin may suck and do no damage, but he gives the raid 3% haste so no harm done.
---
&gt;What else 
---
Pre-nerf spirit of aquementas.
---
This is honestly one of the reasons I've never been interested in Druid.
---
This sub gets a little closer to r/teenagers every day...
---
You clap are clap currently clap bitching clap about clap it clap this clap very clap instant clap!
---
FFS
---
Honestly this is where loot trading should ONLY be allowed is on master loot. It should not be triggered on need before greed rolls.
---
You couldn't not name a single hunter, nor could you provide any video evidence with a more efficient levelling route. Prove me wrong, I'll wait.
---
Thinking of maining a Warlock or Shaman come Classic, leaning a little more to Shaman since Warlock's been my main since forever in retail. 
---
I want to roll Enhance or Elemental due to those cool PVP videos, but I'm definitely going to have to spec Resto to raid right? 
---
I'm not going to be able to go hardcore like I used to so farming gold for constant respecs might be a problem, would Alchemy/Herbalism be a good choice for gold farming/saving? I'm also curious how much time others spent farming, are we talking all day grinds or maybe one-two hours or more a night?
---
"Other guilds getting given the same raid ID, leading to some epic ~20v20 pvp battles INSIDE Molten Core for the raid ID."
---
This one I experienced and it was amazing. I was alliance and we were all zoning into MC and all of the sudden a bunch of horde started zoning in as well while we were waiting for the rest of our group. I remember there was total confusion on vent and in chat and no one had a clue what was going on. Then one of our warriors charged....and all hell broke loose. I WISH I had my old screenshots from vanilla....
---
same here, joined wow late wrath and started playing vanilla during wod and now I prefer it over every other wow expansion (well, I didn't get to play tbc yet) 
---
You have to realize pservers and retail vanilla are so different that you can't even begin to compare the two especially when it comes to speed levelling. Pservers do not use accurate stats, values etc. It's all guess work and bandaid fixes. I get that you probably started playing on those private servers for a few months and now you think you've actually played vanilla wow.
---
yeah right 
---
:)
---
Oh yeah, 1.12 classic, it's not Vanilla.  It's not the real deal.
---
lv48 are green for 60s, so not unlikely
---
Not yet.
---
Can you guys believe it!?
---
1.12 never will be.
---
It will never be 1:1. 
---
And you will never know what you missed.
---
Why do you seem like your proud about cutting out video games to go to raves and be a hippie?
---
It’s played in vanilla so I won’t miss anything. 
---
Do you have any server recommendations? 
---
Never said I don’t want criticism of the company - but criticism without merit and factual points is useless. I honestly don’t care what’s posted here. (Otherwise I would report and not comment) 
---
When I opened the thread I expected a list of grievances that proved why someone can s**t on them. I got “You can’t trust them; look at the past 15 years!”
---
If you want the real reason you can crap on them it’s their propensity to giving into the player base. After BC  they made the endgame more accessible to the masses. Before that they made decisions based on whether the changes where good for the game. 
---
Circular: every argument can be considered circular. But the “don’t buy the product” does turn in to less profit for the company and HOPEFULLY they realize they failed. 
---
All of them. I just kill boars to hit max level.
---
Bro previous poster COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR. He acknowledges the distinction but also points out that when working in conjnunction, THERE IS NO DISTINCTION. Sharding on live results in never, ever seeing the same players twice - because you are simultaneously sharDED AND cross realmed.
---
Implementation of both was one of the very worst things that has ever happened in video games.
---
Well then it's evident that you were such a n00b that you have forgotten what 1.05 was like; and how much fun we all had raiding MC without DM gear.
---
/blocked for nonsense
---
It was a lot of fun....
---
Yes, and? Eventually you'll get it I think but it may take a while. The Socratic method and all.
---
Escort quests, elite quests in caves. 
---
I always do escort quests, but they take way too long and are endlessly frustrating.  I kind of do it for the challenge. 
---
Quests were you clear a whole cave or den full of elites are never worth doing.  The quest rewards tend to suck, you need a balanced group to do it, and if you wipe, which you probably well good luck every recovering.  They're just not worth the time and frustration.  Just run a dungeon instead.  
---
Were there different class quests in 1.12 than there were previously? A quick search on the wiki tells me that the aquatic form quests have sent you to Darkshore and Westfall until Wrath.
---
-Druids don't need threat management, feral arguably has the best TPS in the game.
---
-Prot paladins do need more threat management, but what they need more is a defensive cooldown and way more damage mitigation.
---
-Balance druids could use better mana efficiency, but that's already sort of manageable using copious amounts of consumables. The main thing holding them back is that their base damage output is simply too low.
---
The problem is that if you focus on fixing those issues without additional changes, it will cause other balance issues. Since vanilla has only 41-point talent trees, it is incredibly easy to blend different specs in a way that wasn't possible in later expansions. 
---
For instance, a holy paladin can easily function with just 20 points in the holy tree. If you give prot paladins more mitigation and a defensive cooldown, holy paladins can use their remaining 31 points to get the same benefits. That's a great way to make arguably the best PvP healer even more overpowered than it already is.
---
Druids have awesome mobility, self healing, solid CC and good melee dmg soak thanks to bear form. Although their damage isn't the greatest, druids are one of the best 1v1 classes thanks to their ability to outlast the opponent. There already is an extremely solid deep balance PvP spec, increased damage capabilities and mana efficiency would make it way stronger.
---
I'm not saying that the PvE presence of meme specs would be impossible to balance, but if you wanted to do it without messing up the rest of the game, you would have to change much more than just a few talents.
---
Whether it will be successful or not we'll have to see, but i know for a fact the launch is going to be insane and I can't wait to experience it. 
---
There are still many areas I haven’t been to, and dungeons/raids I haven’t done! And I even played Vanilla for a whole year.
---
I'd say warrior tank and she can go pala, it's one of the strongest duos if you plan to PvP.
---
*laughs in elemental*
---
#A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES
---
There's a reasonable expectation of such criticism being common knowledge on a place like this, meaning such a list is neither warranted nor necessary. Indeed as I explained it would actually prove to be counter-productive and a means to derail the thread by directing discussion towards irrelevant specifics.
---
A more general way to describe the point of the thread would be - "if Activision-Blizzard did this before, why should I trust them not to do it again". 'This/It' in this case being, among other things, the criticism you yourself listed - which again is why it was unnecessary for me to mention it, because anyone who cares enough to read/post in a thread like this would have heard it before. 
---
As for the point about profit, I see no reason why paying customers should be precluded from criticizing the company whose product they utilize - which is what the "don't buy the product" argument does, by implying that the only legitimate form of criticism is boycott.
---
Absolutely.  My guild had several melee hunters.  One with used the Hand of Rag and the other with Dual Thunderfury who used a magic cat that shot fire from his eyes and lightning from his asshole.
---
Holy paladin can afford to put 31 points into Ret or Prot without losing any really important stuff. Hell, even if they moved Illumination deeper into the Holy tree, a healer with no points in Holy and 31 points in Ret would be more beneficial than a Ret DPS.
---
The real vanilla experience.
---
They're fun in some group pvp situations and solo play, still not as a good as say using your gun.
---
They were nerfed because too many couldn't figure out how to do them and/or how to complete them.  "Too hard."
---
I remember the mage quest in DWM was nerfed -- but it was one of those that was wonderful, you had to use not only your own skills, but some of those other trinkets that would help, i.e., sleep, net or stun.
---
The one quest for the druid swimming, I believe, took you into MoonGlade, diving into the lake, and there were elite creatures along the areas where the item was located.
---
Quests will always give the same amount of exp regardless of color, unless it's gray. Red, orange, yellow, or green the quest will give the same exp.
---
To hardcore players players that have no idea already are invisible, so you leaving is just the status quo.
---
As a melee hunter you can be viable as a free HK
---
It’s NOT about PvP’ing against enemies of your own level.   It’s about mercilessly getting ganked by high level sadists, who gank lowbies because they lose to other max-level players. 
---
No.
---
My guild had sometimes had an &lt;Empty Slot&gt; joining the raid. It's not like his performance was really astounding, but we even managed to kill KT with 39 people, and even once he invited his friend - a second &lt;Empty Slot&gt;, so that we downed the boss with 38 people. This directly implies that &lt;Empty slot&gt; is a viable raiding spec because you can kill bosses with it anyways. 
---
Also it was very nice of him not to ask for any gear since probably he managed to understand that there are people who carried him and they should be rewarded.
---
Melee hunters have some of the higher Nightfall upkeep as they can spam wing clip. Also pet damage is allright with pre nerf Lupos (and the pserver focus bug).
---
So altough their personal dps isnt good or as good as a normal hunter they do provide a good support roll. (In a caster heavy raid setup they even add more dps than a "normal" hunter).
---
Other hunter? What 5 man has ***TWO*** hunters?
---
Classic is running in the modern wow engine. I would be surprised if you can do 1080p 60 fps with a 7950. I'm running a 1080ti on water overclocked and barely keep up 144fps in 1440p. Whatever FPS you get in modern wow will be pretty close to what you'd get in classic.
---
The below quote seems to be a common thing I see in this sub very often:
---
&gt;doesn't matter that there was a best cookie cutter build, you could make a build that was fun and still functional.
---
but I don't think I believe it. Just last night I was reading a thread about how Ret is a meme spec and doesn't belong in group content because their DPS is lower than tanks. They're not wrong, because any class that is able to heal was forced to do so and class balance was *extremely* poor. Just respec at the trainer, you say? It was expensive to respec, do you remember that? The price escalated each time you did it. And gold was hard to come by back then. Sure, you can play whatever you want, but you'd better be ready to play alone or find people who'll carry you. This was mentioned multiple times in that thread.
---
Another thing that bothers me about your comment is that there's a "finish line". It's an MMO, there shouldn't really *be* an end, that's kind of the point. I don't love the gear treadmill WoW has become either, but let's not pretend that there should be an "ending". Brings to mind the end of the Make Love, not Warcraft episode of South Park where they ask, "What do we do now?" What do you do when you hit the "finish line"?
---
Stromgarde Badges.
---
The badges have an ~15% drop rate from elite mobs, fairly closely clustered, many of which are stealthed. Even a good hunter would have difficulty taking out these guys at around same level. You need 15 of them. They generally drop one at a time, occasionally you'll get 2. They arent shared between group members. The quest doesn't even have a good reward.
---
Avoid at all costs.
---
We're just as bored now as we were back then.
---
It’s not about image size, but about image \_quality\_. All monitors and graphics drivers add \_blur\_ even if scaling ratio is integer.
---
The [lake quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=29/trial-of-the-lake) has been around until 3.3. I can't find anything hinting at there ever being elite mobs at all.
---
There was a class quest nerf wave in BC or Wrath, but I can't find any evidence of them getting nerfed during vanilla.
---
went through some screenshots and remembered how awesome the colors of this 15 year old game look on modern monitors. one reason why i oppose any graphical updates. there's nothing to improve, you can only alter the experience. 
---
Chicken escort quest in Tanaris. It takes 20mins to escort the chicken. But not only that, the chicken may bug out and dissappears in the distance. Respawn is 30mins iirc. Or maybe horde ganks you. Or maybe some genius doesn't understand the phrase "DON'T START THE ESCORT UNTIL EVERYONE TURNS IN THE PREQUEST".
---
A melee hunter is only ever used as a nightfall bot spamming wing clip.
---
I’ve always felt like for lore night elves were the race with the most expansive lore
---
Sylvanas if you're tank/melee and Wrynn if you're anything else? :v
---
ARE YOU KIDDING ME THAT'S AWESOME
---
I've thought this as well.  It was my assumption that Dwarf Priests were superior because it's an incentive to balance the Alliance faction to have more offensive dispels against Hordes Shaman.  Purely speculative.
---
I think many will agree that Wrath of the Lich King was the best version of WoW. Perhaps BC and Wrath are down the road if Classic is successful. 
---
"collect 10 rat fangs" type of quests.  
---
  
---
On a fresh server it will be painful.
---
They're both bad. 
---
To me its more than a game, it sounds weird but i deeply care about classic wow.
---
I know blinking can still make you fall in some places on BFA. My char was stuck for 2 days in Legion (blinked on stairs) so yea, somewhere it's still broken
---
To me its more than a game, it sounds weird but seeing classic be a shadow of what it should be will depress me
---
Either that or I need someone to adopt my 2 kids, wife, and lend me a lot of money. Either works.
---
No spec is bad period.
---
Yeah, it will definitely depress me a little bit having it not be as good as it could be, thankfully nothing leads me to believe it won’t be fantastic.
---
I'd be down for that man
---
That 8 stam was bis for 19 twink kf any class.
---
Be ready for the pain! I went on a private server last night...holy shit! I forgot about so much. Quests don’t auto populate on the right side. Quests don’t hold your hand and tell you where to go...mobs take forever to die (playing a warrior). Picking up quest items is about 5-10 secs longer...no auto loot... 1-5 took me an 1.5 hours. But a lot more fun and when you go to gold shire the tavern actually has people talking...You feel like you’re inside the game...you’re completely immersed...no rushing...have fun and don’t quit! 
---
That’s what makes them so good.
---
Shoot, thought I was in /r/hearthstone at first.
---
I leveled as a warrior in vanilla and can attest that prot spec is painful. When I switched to DPS it was like taking the brakes off, and i could tank dungeons just fine.
---
But as usual, you do you.
---
I'm going to playing feral ne druid. I have interest in doing gathering profs until 60 then switching. Can anyone recommend professions that I can level easily and will provide something at 60?
---
Pretty sure regular paladins are cloth paladins 
---
The thing is, despite only getting 20% xp for green mobs, vanilla 'loremaster' is a really fantastic journey and if you've never played the original WoW, or you forget what it was about, it was the journey and not the destination.
---
For a lot of Roleplayers the RP aspects of RP-WPvP is immense. Those "imaginary terms of engagement" are a crucial part of the Roleplaying experience that takes place during these events. Tales will be told and recorded on the forums about dark and brooding rogues and valorous and honorable warriors! Over all this whole event is about creating a story about two factions in a fantasy world struggling to out-perform each other on the fields of battle (that and I VASTLY prefer the lore found in Vanilla than that of MoP and later expansions) and although regular WPvP may be easier to obtain I feel that the experience is cheaper than having a real and official battle that takes place over several weeks or months or maybe even years. Taking the mage tower for hours on end is fun, but to systematically dominate a faction all over the globe and have it make a meaningful impact on the RP community as a whole is worth so much more! I'd rather see talk at the tavern about the war waged in the plaguelands and about crazy stories in which players do amazing and unexpected things than about how "they were in Ironforge again". I appreciate your input but I think you may have overlooked the value of the RP part. Also thanks for making that guide I'm a fan! 
---
For the Horde!
---
I plan to play Horde, after playing alliance for more than 10 years. It Will be a whole new world !
---
Meh, full dps all the way. Don't need Stam when you one shot people! 
---
That's a fantastic input. Thanks for the comment! I guess narrowing it down to a certain goal was just my way of having a clear and decisive "victor" to then tie into that broader idea of having a world conquest map.
---
I could see it as and interesting PvP prospect. I can imagine a warrior fighting through a concussive shot, a frost trap, a scatter shot, only to run into a hunter with a ton of strength and stamina and no interest in creating distance.
---
Ive quit several characters on private servers around 20. That's when I start thinking about how long the road to 60 is and usually decide I have better things to do since server will die anyway. Last 60 was on nost.
---
Expect a lot of that for people who arent massive vanilla fans.
---
Being a young kid who decided to play as a night elf and discovering the journey I had to make to get to Ironforge and Stormwind to play with my friends. I figured it wouldn't be that difficult to get from one Alliance capital to another, but figuring out the path I had to travel from asking other players and looking at the map felt like an actual quest. It was a serious journey and I died a lot in the Wetlands. I knew like nothing about the game and figured it all out from other players, signs, and the map, it felt like I actually traveled a great distance though dangerous wilderness. It was awesome. 
---
It's a blast!  I think there's a broad spectrum of what hunters can do given the right thinking and skill.  I find the vanilla hunter to be pretty versatile in dungeons.  I like your idea there, but I'd almost say distracting shot one into freezing trap, and have your pet tank another mob.  2 ccs!
---
I thought you were being serious and was about to comment on hunters using Maces until I read the second part of the sentence and realised you were trolling.
---
I like you. 
---
So... all the players from Asia are planning on being hardcore raiders on PvP realms, roll Female Undead Priests, and have 4 or more alts.  Gotta love small sample sizes lol.
---
Thanks for posting the results.  There's some interesting info in here.
---
I love the idea of there being slightly upset Night Elves monitoring reddit waiting for someone to misspell that and then just whip out a quick correction.
---
Patches. Discovery. Exploration. Not knowing my pre raid BiS 1 year before launch. 
---
I was always curious if a hunter had 2 of the dragon's call swords + hand of justice and stuff if it would be any good dps spam wing clip for max up time on ur dragons. Could be terrible but I was curious.
---
As a teenager i subscribed to r/teenagers i am offended.
---
Take your upvoted and get the fuck outta here
---
Nope, out of the 3 Paladin specs they are easily the worst one in Vanilla, and absolutely never used in raids. They are okay in 5 mans (not the best though), and can perhaps level faster than the other two specs with AoE grind (I never tried this in Vanilla, it was very common in TBC), but that's it.
---
One shotting people is hard when every other twink stacks insane stamina
---
I don't know, between the two clearly one is a dick and it's not the Ret. Just based on the screenshot. 
---
The first WoW Npc I ever interacted with. I remember being so excited gathering stuff off those boars. I was sure they'd be worth something!
---
tl;dr if you loot a bop item and you didn't get it by need rolling, you can trade it to anyone else who could've gotten it for 120 minutes.
---
Literally nobody knows yet.
---
My money's on "oh, that sounds reasonable" once they release details.
---
Not that I recall, maybe they've changed on private servers now if people twink there, &amp; I did play a twink Rogue then though so probably not a surprise that Ambush one shot them and if it didn't, the following Evisc did.
---
That's one of the versions implemented, esp after personal loot was a thing. There have been others.
---
[seal of saurfang]
---
+10 stam
---
+10 spirit
---
+10 strength
---
+10 empathy
---
use: become a green boy for 30 mins (It's not easy).
---
Your a hunter, you have like 2 buttons and you want to press even less. 70% of your damage is from autoshot. Do you just want to sit in your chair and DPS? Play a ret paladin.
---
Can i ask the point? If your worried about trying to make vanilla look crazy beautiful in a way it isn't already, then it might not be the game for you.
---
all gear in vanilla was hunter gear 
---
this is mostly a joke but trust me it will make sense when you start running dungeons with random hunters. 
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Thanks! I guess since im in no way in a hurry to 60 Engi/Mining seems like a good idea. Like i said in another comment i think im going to create an alt for spamming early lvl mining and skinning. Tailoring seems like an awesome idea but engineering is just too damn fun! I was thinking of having a lvl 5 Bank alt with enchanting so i can disenchant on that char. Maby ill make him a tailor aswell so i can sell bags. Thanks for a rly helpfull comment.
---
This is incorrect. We know the details from the Blizzcon Classic panel. I quote: "Loot Trading. So this was a system added in Wrath of the Lich King where if you've looted an item from a dungeon or raid boss there's a two hour window where you can give it to someone else even though it's bind on pickup who also participated in the boss kill"
---
Which it is right now....
---
Technically none of them, lol. 
---
The money comes from vendoring grey items.
---
The gear comes off AH by searching " of the *the affix you need* " 
---
Quests are here just to point the next grinding place. 
---
Okay, so, as a warrior could I have my mate the druid roll need on a plate helm then trade it to me? Or only other plate wearers can roll need on it?
---
True, but until we hear otherwise, I think it's reasonable to assume the way it worked in legion (which is the version they're forking from) is the way it's going to work.
---
&gt; So this was a system added in Wrath of the Lich King
---
and then changed several times over the next few expansions.
---
Which version are they going with?
---
In pre-BC all classes could roll on everything. It was a community enforced rules that stopped that. 
---
My experience on a private server is that most warriors are leather wearing dps specs
---
This is a video of a list of 10 OP abilities in classic.
---
Does anyone remember any others?
---
I played a Warlock and was surprised to find that I could use "Enslave Demon" on world Elites. Pretty awesome to have a temporary pet that can hit like a truck. 
---
But Legion uses personal loot, which has many more implications for loot trading than when it was first implemented in wrath.
---
Honestly ive played so many pservers and retail vanilla, that it all gets muddled up. The majority of my twink exp is in tbc era where its actually sword spec you want to run as a 19 rogue, only because there is a better 19 sword than any other weapon
---
They could all roll on it, but they wouldn't be able to trade it after they needed.
---
Given they want it to lessen GM time it is most likely it is going to be Wrath version where all loot (need or greed) is trade-able for 2 hours. 
---
Used to weapon switch iirc though that might have been for L29. 
---
If I had a 4K monitor I would gouge my eyes out before playing at a 1080 resolution.  1080 is for morons that don’t understand that 1080 is for TVs not computing. 
---
I haven’t used a resolution smaller than 1200p since 2006 (1920x1200).  And haven’t haven’t had anything less than 2k since 2009 (2560x1600). 
---
It’s 2019 and people still think inferior panels the companies are pushing to save money are worth their salt.  
---
Legion dungeons yes, but not every dungeon had personal loot, classic dungeons still ran with group loot.
---
The talent tree rework was pretty substantial. Goodbye, thrown weapon mastery! Hello free weapon skill.
---
Lol for some reason I'm being downvoted. I'm not suggesting it's good. I'm asking if under any realistic circumstances, could it be. The answer appears to be no, although the 2x dragons call idea was pretty interesting.
---
I got mine for sub $10 each a few months ago.  They are climbing slowly even still.
---
Just saw this for the first time. Thank you for sharing.
---
Sooo, I’m gonna lose myself in the game? Cool. 
---
I'm actually looking forward to having a (hopefully) set and static end.
---
There's still a lot of content to go through, and with less play time than I used to have, it's going to take me a long time to do.  I never got close to doing all the quests before they changed.  Love the old bgs.  Then there's alts and rp and more.
---
New content is fun and all, but at the same time I got burned out on the whole quicker reset thing as wow expansions progressed...felt like I had to rush and work really hard to do everything before the game moved on.
---
Yes.  I'm sure some people are going to clear all the content very very quickly.  There will be a 'absolute top min/max build' for every class for every situation.  None of that applies to me though, or bothers me.
---
There are so many wacky gear and talent combos.  Most people aren't going to be able to clear all the raid content quickly...or even for a long time.
---
People are going to be running around with horribly mismatched and less than optimum gear sets for a long time...and getting to rejoice in getting new stuff for a long time.  Then there's the return to situational builds in pvp that don't care about the 'most efficient' or 'most dps'.  Then playing around with weird builds to make the next dungeon work for your group of friends.
---
TL;DR  There's a finite amount of variations and stuff to do in vanilla wow.  That still adds up to years of playtime for me :P
---
As a hunter from vanilla in 2004. I LOVE THIS. 
---
Stopped after 10 seconds. 
---
Is listing out the 10 abilities too much? Is that too hard?
---
I’m sorry, I refuse to burn IQ points by listening to some moron millennial talk for 15 minutes about nothing. 
---
10000% skip the Faldir's Cove quests unless you have a water breathing ability or ally. 
---
People stop playing past 30 because ganking makes it impossible to actually play the game. Why log in to be ganked for a few hours. It's just not fun on the high pop server past 30. Unless you are the dominate faction 
---
Nice.
---
THIS x10000
---
So you're an anti-social sadist.  Good to know... :P
---
It's alright for pvp pre aq.
---
Farewell, Captain Placeholder. 
---
Nithe.
---
So holy pallys, is the only viable pally option. Hum.
---
dammit
---
Thankfully, there's all kind of players and groups out there.
---
This only happens when a 'for fun just want to try this' player gets into a 'let's do this right!' group.
---
At least twice a day do I lose my shit over how excited I am. 
---
And they also won't beat anyone in PvP.
---
I'm taking my hard earned two weeks of vacation to sit at my computer and just play nonstop. I'd like to see someone try and pull me away. 
---
Arcanite Reaper was so good if you got it before speed normalization.
---
Not knowing what loot a boss was going to drop. 
---
Charging into 20 players and Intimidating Shout when it wasn't capped (or was very high)
---
That was fucking incredible
---
&gt;And at that level you can start farming your pre-raid BiS so you can spam dungeons if you don't want to quest.
---
This can't be stated enough. It's seriously such a lifesaver for the last 3 (5 if you're lucky) levels. Really breaks some of the monotony as well. Getting good gear pre-60 feels great.
---
That's the reason I never play on a pserver, the kack of permanence. Now that you know that your toon will be safe, will you try and go past that?
---
Not in the northern emisphere, which is where Blizzard HQs are.
---
Warrior takes 40 levels or so. But that's just because MS is at 40.
---
This is pretty wrong, 40 is huge for Frost mage especially. Ice barrier is a game changer.
---
Play as rogue. No pet. Medium armor. Great in PvP. U can even train Bows/Crossbows at weapon master ( dont remember if guns ). And simple to use.

Looking at how far Blizzard has fallen, I wouldn't get too excited. They are bound to fuck up Classic sooner or later.
---
Books are nice if u don’t have 2 monitors
---
Doubt it, see stickied census.
---
Low level PvP that isn't entirely twinks.  You used to get normal people who were leveling up queued up for the 10-19 and 20-29 WSG.  There's no joy in doing a BG where everyone there has gear that puts them as far ahead of you as another 10 levels would.  BGs used to be a break for me while I was leveilng, something to break things up and change up the pace.  Now I do 2 turn ins worth for the XP in each bracket and then stay out of BGs the rest of the game (unless I need to do AV for a piece of gear there).
---
This is an excellent video (not done by me btw), and good information. 
---
If you're not interested move on. 
---
It's slower than questing alone if you have a self-sufficient class.. a mage, for instance, could solo level faster probably. However, having a group and spamming dungeons is something I've done before and I think it's what I'll do. It's easier, involves less thought, you always have good gear, etc. But questing will show you the world. 
---
A lot of people say to only do dungeons if you have the corresponding quests, but a group of players spamming them together is my go-to. It's a way to level that requires minimal thought. While questing, you have to read the quest logs and figure stuff out. Navigate your way through mobs and zones. All that. Dungeon spamming just run the same one over and over until the next one. 
---
The only content isn't dungeons and raids, and even in dungeons people were much more lenient until you were doing harder ones while undergeared.
---
There's only one instant 60 pserver that has more than 10 people online. It's the first and pretty much the only thing that comes up if you google it.
---
5 gigs is pretty much nothing today, if anything, that won't be a factor.
---
In retail you might switch 1 talent once a week if you're doing a particularly aoe centric fight, other than that you never change your talents ever if you're min maxing.
---
oh damn... black skin blonde hair warlock... sounds awesome

While i havent played druid past like level 30, I have recently played and capped a holy paladin on a private server. I leveled as Ret and kept heal gear set and was able to heal dungeons as Ret easily until around 51 or so when i respec. I am not sure if i could have kept healing as ret but around that level is when you actually start acquiring some level 60 BiS gear so i just went ahead and made the switch. I will say that leveling as Ret is pretty boring. It takes forever to kill stuff but you also dont die. Just maintain your seal and hit shit. Paladin is the better healer. On my server guilds were always looking for priest and paladins. Like some others have said, Druid is more of a true support class and its healing numbers are usually the lowest out of all the healers. Paladins have excellent heals and are extremely mana efficient. You also have some really useful tools/buffs and can be really annoying and sometimes impossible to kill in pvp. Warrior/Holy paladin together is ridiculous.  
---
I don't think you can call someone a tourist who hit lcl cap, that's an achievement in itself.
---
Delegating 1-2 healers to stay 50 yards outside of the encounter and be Out of Combat Rezzers
---
Inb4 Gates of AQ sharding buzzkill
---
You ever run a 5man with 2 Hunters? You fucking wreck it. Hunter Pets can solo tank 5man elites without much trouble as long as you're BM 
---
To add to this i usually hate healing but i loved playing holy paladin in vanilla. Something about being a tanky ass healer was fun. The main gripe with vanilla paladin is that holy is so good and prot/ret is so meh (especially ret) that you are forced to play holy. Cool thing is if you do raid/run dungeons etc as holy you can pick up ret gear eventually for when you do want to go full meme youll have BiS for it lol.
---
Certainly if my life permits me to play more than occasionally. As things stand I wont be on at launch and when I will have time is no certainty.
---
That's why I get angry whem people talk about adding shit to the game once the full time gamers finish the content. I could end up missing the gane I've been trying to play again for years.
---
Right?!  Each hunter is 2 ccsf, freezing trap and pet tank. 
---
First, I don't know how you can say that "I don't like it" isn't a valid reason, because it's literally just as valid as "I do like it", which is the opposition.
---
Second, they very well could have a reason to bring it back, which worries people. The Silithus content release and AQ launch event will both bring massive influxes of people to a single zone (especially if both are done simultaneously, which is currently the plan IIRC). Those events are famous for their ludicrous crowds, and the experience will be greatly diminished without them. They could easily result in higher player density than launch.
---
Third, I don't work for Blizzard's technical department, so I can't say for sure how their servers are programmed, but saving computing costs via smaller shards is definitely plausible at least. The less interactions a server needs to check, the less processing power you need. And players are capable of many complex and unpredictable interactions with each other, so reducing number of possible player interactions will save on servers.
---
Lastly, just going to add one more reason to not shard at launch: streamlined questing experiences are the default for the game. Given time, zone population in questing areas will move towards reasonably low player density. For players who are looking forward to massively crowded zones at launch, Sharding removes their only chance at this experience. They can't get it later. The players wanting to play the game normally can. Essentially, it's deleting a unique gameplay opportunity for more of the same. I can't get behind that, even if the "massive crowds" fanbase is only 5% of the playerbase - I'd rather take away 5% from 95% of players, than 100% from 5% of players.
---
Only actually good if you have a ton of warlocks, which of you're min maxing you will only have enough for coe/cos/recklessness and blood pact for tank.
---
Dont group with them, and dont constantly gank them and you wont be known at all..
---
Rekbombing is amazing don't be afraid to go ret if you wanna be a world PvP god.
---
Back in vanilla I played Moonkin spec (but would usually just heal in 20-man raids). Personally I feel Classic should stay as close to the original as possible, which means not making any specs "more viable". The whole game was kinda balanced around these specs not being optimal and it would impact the game a lot. 
---
Let's hope there will be a TBC Classic release as well in the future for playing all classes and specs as optimal as possible, since TBC was balanced around that.
---
I skip every escort quest there is, except for the one in Swamp of Sorrows because it's fairly short and you kill a lot of shit doing it. If he dies though, that's the end for me.  
---
But they release games all over the world.
---
True, but I had in mind the mobs that will likely need to be killed to complete said quest. The level of those mobs relative to you is more important than the color of the quest, I think.
---
Greed roll + unequipped = tradeable for 2 hours

Yea that's funny

Perfect! Thank you!

Typical millennial response. Short attention span and low IQ lol You have a lot of growing up to do if you hope to survive as a millennial brained nothing in classic, bud. 
---
That Ban'ethil Barrow Den one was a nightmare for me recently
---
Because people have no fucking idea what nostalgia is.
---
I myself like to occasionally play an old-school games like Doom/Quake/NFS (first parts) and alike, or watching some badass 80's movies in a long winter nights, so I know what that is. 
---
Let's make an example what's wow nostalgia would be like. You'd create a character on a private server. Run here and there, finish the first zone, get some class quests going, grab your first bags, some of the first greens aswell, spend a few talent points, do a run through The Barrens... And you're pretty much done at this point, ready to forget about the game for another year or two.
---
You wouldn't write a brand new addons from scratch, commiting hundreds of hours.
---
You wouldn't make a 30 pages guide, constantly revising it.
---
You wouldn't commit tons of hours to raid, inventing a new strategies, making an excel-table with a loot wishlist with a possible enchants.
---
You wouldn't seek a way to be a better player, to constantly learn your class and improve (the game kinda pushes you to do so lol).
---
But you do.
---
And there's no amount of a fucking nostalgia that can give you THAT much of an energy without if you're not *really* interested in what you're doing. 
---
So, yeah. We play this game because it's still remains a good game even in 2019. Period.
---
I play on a private server on a 55" 4k OLED tv at 2160p
---
How incredibly rude.
---
So much Wrynning.
---
I mained a lock through Vanilla and I'm playing it again.. The gameplay it self is relatively easy with a lot of fun "gadget" spells.. I would recommend going undead, the lore is more fun imo.. For PvP if is better but Orcs are slightly better for PvP..
---
BFa lock and a Vanilla lock are VERY different playstyles.. I loved my lock in Vanilla ( and I still have it as main)
---
No you won't. Unless they take a really unexpected turn.
---
This debate comes down to what you want out of RP. There will always be people who treat WoW as a glorified chat room and do whatever they want. But if you want to immerse yourself in Warcraft? You *can't* just ignore current events without RPing in the past, and then that becomes your guild's defining trait.
---
Frankly, you are strawmanning the Classic RP argument and all but saying "You think you do, but you don't." It seems like when someone expresses an earnest interest, you question if they are a 'real' RPer.
---
BfA and retail WoW have only improved the game's quality as an animated chat room, at the cost of it's story. Classic is an opportunity to return to a time when *Warcraft* was a setting, rather than a theme park that repeatedly shines light on glaring plot holes, forced characterization for the sake of evoking player reactions (Blizzards own words), and the bastardization of the settings greatest mysteries, the Old Gods and Titans.
---
If you prefer retail RP, more power to you. But I would trade every convenience in retail WoW to return to the roots of Warcraft that I fell in love with.
---
Best version of WoW would be vanilla with TBC class design, the ability to visit TBC areas as expanded 50-60 content and extremely limited flying. 
---
I was a pure teenage no lifer in vanilla and I don't remember EVER doing a full brd clear. Was always a certain type of run specified before we started. Same with a lot of the other mega dungeons. But still, dungeons were without a doubt way longer back then.
---
That's a pretty weak answer, but okay. 
---

---
It's cute how high level and attentive you think the general users of classic will be.
---
Withered Thtaff
---
You don't have to convince me that TBC made a lot of improvements, I personally liked TBC even more than Vanilla but this isn't a tbc remake it is a vanilla remake. 
---
The Horde quest  "Protect Kaya" quest in Stonetalon Mountains is a trap. It's actually fairly easy but the NPC you're escorting has almost no HP and dies in just a few hits. There's a point where 3 mobs spawn at once and attack her, not counting anything else that might be spawned in the area. If you don't have 1 other person helping you out don't bother with it. That said with some planning and foresight it is completely soloable. 
---
Lol. I feel like this is what bring is a hunter us like.
---
Heh

Only thing hunters are good for in raids is nightfall wingclip spam. Misdirect. And you can blame them for almost everything. Hunter is a bitch class. They carry around repair bots because they wipe the raid most.

---
Yup, funny thing is that I am just gearing up right now to do some rousing rogue pvp in redridge. (I don't target anyone green or in the teens because A) I am NOT a jackass, and B) When I lose to them I will delete my character in frustration)
---
Yea, just don’t give up! 
---
Desktop real estate
---
Yeah Kevin said it was too similar to all the other strikes the melee classes got but he added it back to the spec in TBC so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
I don't like to fight warriors in pvp at my level because it's not fair to them, I just let them quest. 
---
I’m okay with not making class balance changes but I really wish players would also be more honest about the fact that it is broken. 
---
Kevin Jordan himself, on the ClassiCast, pointed out that they bungled Ret and Prot Paladins in the big Paladin patch (1.9) and then decided that since Holy was the more popular spec, they weren’t going to revisit Ret and Prot until TBC. 
---
It’s all fine and dandy to want to play a museum-piece for nostalgic purposes, but this idea that the game was well-designed and that everything was intentional and polished is ridiculous. 
---
In that same interview, Kevin states that the old devs would most likely want nothing to do with Classic because to them all these problems aren’t quaint, or cute or whimsical. 
---
They’re placeholders that were left unfixed until a later date. A date that evetually came. 
---
This is why I keep trying to tell people: The best version of Vanilla is TBC. 
---
Calm down, angsty.
---
yeh man
---
i play melee hunter. NO RANGED WEAPON. NO PET. PURE MELEE
---
its actually really good dps. mongoose slicer is insane face metler
---
I’m not entirely sold that crowd pummelers are necessary. Does anyone have some sort of comparison between when and when not using them?
---
It's his subtle way of bragging that he has a real life now. Which seems almost productive until you read everything after friends.
---
So in short hes basically just doing drugs all day.
---
Major life transition 
---
If you go to his comments in the video he says it's only a 60-100 dps. Overall I think he could hold back on bosses that are on farm, giving him less pummeler runs. However 50% is alot of attack speed and omen procs, ESPECIALLY with bear druid. Pummeler is amazing for bear tanks. I can't say much hopefully u/shedothedruid chimes in.

---
&gt; first kill of Ragnaros... with me as the main bear tank
---
Am I correct to say patch 1.12 bears are superior to warriors for Ragnaros?  The Warrior's shield block is completely useless in an all elemental damage fight while Druids are bigger hp sponges who can easily charge back into melee when they get punted.  The reason Druids didn't tank Rag originally is because guilds were long past MC by the time the 1.08 Druid revamp patch arrived.
---
Be prepared to cut on IRL friendly activity.

I did the exact same just after Christmas. Dungeon Guide and Atlas came in and the strategy guide and Master Guide are on their way.

I actually might wait a week or two until after launch. I only trust blizzard as far as I can throw them.

Shaman being enhancement is fine as hopefully he took the +5% mana talents! Clearly healer in heart!

This.

Criticism where it is warranted is welcome, but I'm not jumping on a hate train because of how a company has treated other projects I haven't cared about for a decade.
---
For now, Blizzard are making all the right noises about this project. The only blizzard title I am still interested in.
---
Viva La Barrens.
---
In PvE yes, Nightfall bot, although it’s pretty sad:
---
In PvP... kind of. Check out Corossity on Youtube. In one video he shows double Dragon’s Call and yes it can proc a lot by spamming wing clip and it hurts quite a bit when it does but we don’t know if the proc rate on pserver is correct.
---
It’s probably better if you can get a good 2h, 2/2 Savage Strike for the big Raptor strike crit. Then it depends on your build, Intimidation is strong but survival has good melee tools with Dissuasion/Counterattack, Immolation trap can also hit pretty hard and proc Entrapment on each tick... Then you can use stuffs like Tidal Charm, guardian summoning trinkets, Goblin sapper charge... Depending on proc rate other 1h weapons might be good, like Silent Fang. But since you mostly use your range weapon, your melee weapon setup is very versatile so you should be using a skull of impending doom in offhand against some classes, can’t do that if you need a 2h for damage. Basically a good hunter with a good 2h can destroy a rogue and another hunter, you’ll see in the video that Corossity beats Monkeynews in r14 gear so it’s even possible to beat a geared warrior in melee, but against casters or melee hybrid it’ll take engi/trinkets/consumables and even then it’s just easier to OOM them from 41 yards.
---
Or you can check « spellpower melee hunter » on Youtube. Even if you could acquire that kind of gear in Classic, I don’t know if the proc rate will be the same, and Blizzard might nerf it. Spellpower ranged hunter is also a thing. 
---
41.0 yards ≈ 37.5 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

Fresh TBC server blizzlike, enough time to grind a lvl 70 and see a few TBC dungeons /raids before Classic
---
What about an OPGA (Old People Guild Alliance)
---
You've got your "Old People" like me (33) who have jobs/families/etc but still want to have that "Vanilla experience".  
---
So we join a "Old person guild" where there's a bit too many members on the raid team (I'm talking like 65 people that are geared for raiding and that guild has set raid days).
---
So that "Old person guild" joins the "Old person guild alliance" where there's 8-10 guilds working in tandem (2 or so guilds have their raid nights each night) where if one guild is short the PUG comes from the other guilds and vice versa.
---
If it gets too big, one guild starts a concurrent raid and conglomerates the "raid orphans"

I haven't enjoyed retail since before Activision. I just want Classic, no bells no whistles.

As long as one server is no changes I'll be happy. 
---
&gt; It seems like when someone expresses an earnest interest, you question if they are a 'real' RPer.
---
That’s not what I’m doing at all. I don’t think I ever even used the phrase “real RPer”, and haven’t even tried to imply that people aren’t “real” RPers for not RPing my way, or whatever.
---
Someone tried to tell me BfA is bad for RP because the low level zones are irrelevant in the grand scheme of the game. But the current state of levelling in BfA has no impact on RP whatsoever. That’s like saying BfA is bad for RP because the difficulty of Mythic raids is too hard, or something. It just doesn’t make sense. That’s why I asked if they RP, because it’s apparent they don’t understand what it is they’re lecturing me on. It’s a reasonable question given the context.
---
Besides, no one has shown any kind of positivity or interest in response to my post. All I’ve gotten is a bunch of downvotes and some hurtful replies, despite doing my best to be polite and helpful. Whatever discussion I was hoping for hasn’t happened, and I feel much worse off for even having bothered. What I was trying to do was shed light on what it’s like to play on a RP/RP-PvP server so people know what to expect going into Classic, while also pointing out that BfA is generally the superior choice for RP if that’s what you want to do. Fuck me I guess.

I will probably level as fury and still tank. Always thought the prot tree was needed at 60 just to be able to keep up with the threat dps classes suddenly started to dish out at 60
---
Good to see more videos, will you be doing any streams anytime soon?
---
Night elves are a good choice for tanks, but i will be a pretty casual player so the increase in reputation gain of the human race might suit me better. Also the sword/mace skill is amazing

They might make it different to how it worked in WotLK or retail (if it didn't change at all since then).
---
They might not.

I'm disappointed we haven't heard anything to clear this up, but whatever.

Hope they at least say something down the year, before the launch. Or whatever advertisement campaign they make, if any.

You will always get 5 water breath potions from an earlier quest or u can buy on AH.
---
I don't understand why having a build be viable is such an issue for you. Yeah sure if you go and do some ridiculous build good on you, but these are actual basic talent trees in the game that aren't intended to be your hipster custom ordered macchiato of a talent tree. If the only thing that makes these builds interesting for you is the factor that they aren't good then why should you be any sort of authority on balance whatsoever? Why can't these commonplace talent trees be viable?
---
You can use water breath potion. You get 5 for free from https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2078
---
TBC feels like they took care of all the things they had on their table for finishing Vanilla they they held off because an expansion was approaching. After that they had to be creative and think of new things to put in so it didn't necessarily all fit in so well. Down to the situation we have now, where they introduce artifact power or whatever and then replace it with azerite or some other grind they came up out of thin air.
---
Everquest. Divine hammer from Griegs End. 
---
Good times haha
---
You assume that's why they reference those zones. To me, it seems they are pointing out that these zones span huge amounts of time, and you can never find a "current day" zone unless it is being actively used for new content. The Sha'tar are still fighting Illidan's forces outside Karabor, even though we know it's generally peaceful now with the Broken in charge.
---
It's an extension of why people like the idea of Classic RP in general, and something that the person brought up in their post: Consistency, and a simpler time in the story. There's no need to theorize what has happened to a 1-60 zone since Cata. Yes, people RP Scarlet Crusade guilds-- But they are playing themselves consistent with current story as the last bastions(Army of the Truthful on MG), rather than claiming to live in a populated monastery because that's how the zone looks out in the world. The state of 1-60 zones *is* irrelevant on retail; It seems the person you responded to wants them to be relevant.
---
As for your last paragraph. I scrolled back through the primary comments on this thread, and at least half of them are expressing an interest in RPing on Classic and explaining why. So I'm not sure what positivity you are expecting that you aren't seeing *any* of, because I am seeing plenty of positivity in response to an all-around negative post.
---
You said it yourself: You are trying to convince people to RP on BfA, that they don't know what they are asking for in RPing on Classic. "You think you do, but you don't." Several primary commenters have explained why they want to RP on Classic, but you brush them off(or latch on to a single aspect of their reply), then play the victim(nobody is lecturing you...) because you didn't convince them? I'm very confused what it is you are trying to accomplish in this thread.
---
I think you're coming at this with in bad faith, purely intending to 'convert' people, with an attitude that isn't conducive toward the discussion you want to happen. Maybe instead of writing a long post explaining why people shouldn't want to RP on Classic, you could ask what it is that interests them and try to work through why they can't fulfill that desire on BfA? I've been planning on forming a community for Classic RPers, so the topic of pros and cons of retail and classic RP have been on my mind a lot.
---
I'm not an RPer so I don't have much say in this. But I do want to roll RP-PvP in Classic to give it a shot. However, I'm only doing that because I want to play Classic, and want to choose to try and RP in Classic. I'm not doing it because I want an ideal RP experience. So it's Classic&gt;&gt;&gt;BFA, then if Classic, RP-PvP
---
Thats wrong. You are thinking about BoE loot from Cata and not Loot Trading for BoP from Wotlk.
---
No, it's a viable spec for raiding. The only problem is you need one shadow priest for Shadow Weaving for warlock face melt. 
---
No, you're not alone in thinking this.  It's just that there have already been plenty of threads about this and the general consensus is "no changes".  Classic WoW as a museum piece is far more important to most people than having a class where every class is balanced for \*one facet of end game play\* and the rest of the game be damned.
---
No love (hatred) for Deep Ocean, Vast Sea?

Tauren spine protrudes 2 feet above their heads, and their heads are completely in front of their torso. No males on the Horde have proper posture. It's probably from all the WoW they play. The females probably aren't as addicted to video games.

That would make no sense if they want to reduce tickets...

&gt; Only thing hunters are good for in raids is nightfall wingclip spam
---
Out of all the hunters I’ve seen on pservers, including the ones that were in guilds clearing Naxx in 2h on release day, there were only two that ran Nightfall. One was in a naxx on-farm guild messing around with NF alongside and the other is on an NA instant-60 raiding server that have been progressing through Naxx for months. There’s more ret pallies than melee hunters in raids. 
---
&gt; Misdirect
---
That’s TBC. 
---
Oh and hunters still bring decent utility and middle of the pack DPS throughout Naxx where their scaling is the worst. Good luck clearing BWL and AQ40 without a tranq shot or two as well. 
---
I suggest you get whatever you have stuck up your ass out by the next time you comment.  
---
Twinks had insane stamina in retail to! Stamina was an easy yet effective stat! And also a lot of stamina enchants! 
---
"I'll show them the power of prot pvp"
---
I had the same thought. On my hunter or rogue I never had to respec - I just built whatever was good st the time and i was generally good to go for farming or pvp or raids. 
---
My healer though? 
---
Respec twice for raids, respec for farming, respec for pvp...

The gold disadvantage you're at as a result of being a quintessential piece of a raid group is phenomenal. It was frustrating then and it will be frustrating again. But that seemed like thats what people want (I wonder how many of them actually played in Vanilla or as a healer/tank class). 
---
People want "Classic" with all of its blunders and failings. I loved vanilla. But it was slow, painful at times, and had its serious problems and failings. I stepped away from WoW shortly before Mists of Panderia came out, so I dont know what the community has been going through, but it must be pretty bad if the #classicunchanged crowd is the predominant opinion 
---
millenials will cry while being ganked by boomers, and the cycle will continue
---
This cannot be emphasized enough.  When people bitch about spec balance, they're ignoring that:
---
1. The devs could've buffed off-specs when doing each class's major talent review and chose not to.  That's pretty daming evidence that not every spec was intended to be a raiding spec.
---
2. Some of those "non-viable" specs (and really, most of them were just not optimal, not non-viable) were nuts in other aspects of the game like BGs or WPvP, leveling, gold farming, or 5 mans.  And while, for instance, Druids were the weakest raid healers overall, they were great for Maexxna and Loatheb.  Shadow Priests for Razuvius, etc.
---
I understand that raiding is literally the only meaningful content in WoW these days and has been since Wrath.  Heroics have been a joke since then.  BGs are a waste of time, except to get some welfare epics for raiding.  WPvP simply doesn't exist.  Gold farming, well, gold is pretty much infinite at this point.  Leveling can be done in a day.  Arena and raids are the only content that has any purpose now.
---
But that was not Vanilla.  And there is no logical argument that can be made for turning Vanilla into that.  It doesn't help Blizzard bring back the players that quit in disgust at what they've done to WoW (and more importantly for them, it doesn't recapture that sub $$$$).  It doesn't preserve Vanilla as a museum piece, which is one of their stated goals.  It's just an argument used by selfish, thoughtless people that doesn't stand up to any serious examination.
---
Theh
---
Took me a sec but boy was it worth it.
---
&gt;You ever run a 5man with 2 #non-retarded Hunters? 
---
Fixed
---
Hah, bet you’ve never been over 1600 arena rating. Keep telling yourself millennials are trash though, might make you feel better when you’re getting ripped in BGs and meters 
---
Since launch day the dev team said they would make prot/ret more viable. Pst they never made it viable during Vanilla Lol. 
---
shamans are more like offensive off healers than proper healers in vanilla pvp, you will wanna be elemental and put a lot of pressure on the enemy team with shocks,purges and big burst combos. your biggest role as a support is using defensive totems and throwing out heals whenever your warrior/warlock/mage is in trouble. 
---
priests are not that squishy in vanilla and have more survivability than shamans because of shields and dispels. both classes are insanely important in any vanilla premade and you wont feel useless with either.
---
Hah, I bet you only played TBC like some kind of casual scrub lord. Buddy, you have a lot of growing up to do. Why don't you PM me when you defeat Van Cleef for the first time in vanilla and I'll be happy to give you some pointers on how to get Onyxia attuned. Until then I'll be chad walking my way through BWL, ya dig? Please don't bother me any more, I have way more important things to do such as going to parties and getting mad laid like a true vanilla player does. Thanks buddy. 
---
What exactly would be a strong answer to you?
---
(slowclap)
---
No a tryhard would stay in it, this is people who are shite and have no patience.
---
Been playing since vanilla. Anyone who uses the word “chad” does not get laid. Enjoy being a scrub come classic, virgin
---
Is there a source?
---
Wrath has the best storyline to me. Killing Arthas always felt like the real goal of WoW because of Warcraft 3. After he was dead I honestly didn't give a fuck about any villains anymore.
---
However, Wrath also added group finder which was the start of the end for the good days of WoW. 
---
Theft of items that could be shared with cohorts.
---
Yep, that's correct, though this was before the gates of AQ opened so was way before 1.12.
---
Even so though, Raggy was a fight where druids were at least as good as Warriors, if not better. The Molten/Lava leather pieces were well itemised for druid tanks so a bear could get high fire resistance easily, the damage intake was smoother, and feral charge was just generally easier to use than stance swap intercept (mostly it was safer in the event of lag).
---
The key element of Bear tanking back then was making the community understand what bears were good at and where they were at least on par with warriors, and why their clear disadvantages (being crit/crushed primarily) was offset somewhat by the huge armor if you geared right. It was a time when noone thought druids were viable for anything.
---
So conversely, little things like choosing Mark of Tyranny instead of Blackhands Breadth, and goign Enchanting for Smoking Heart... were two "minor" choices that completely crippled your survivability in the endgame if you didn't take them as there were no equivalents.
---
Bear tanking was MUCH easier than warrior tanking. Less buttons, much easier to hold threat, no stance dancing bar hte occasional powershifting or swapping to caster when not being hit. The difficulty lay in two things - a.) actually getting the incredibly specific pre-raid blue BIS set that was miles ahead of the "average" feral gear for survivability, and b.) educating people.
---
It doesn't matter if it fits into the philosophy, it wasn't in the original game. This game is supposed to be as close to that game as possible. It doesn't belong. There is already too much sharding even if it's limited.
---
Ha, me a scrub virgin? I beat General Drakkisath once so um maybe go have a long hard look in the mirror buddy. Peace out, girl scout! 
---
&gt; This game is supposed to be as close to that game as possible.
---
Neither were streamers in the original game. Are you for prohibiting streaming of the game too?
---
So you have a schedule like anyone else here.
---
You can raid progress with that amount of time.
---
Imo, a lot of people agree that classic class balance is broken but accept it for what it is.
---
Long term sharding IS an issue for me. I thoroughly plan on participating in massive WPvP battles and sharding directly has a negative impact on everyone's experience at the event. 
---
Bs. That is plenty of time to do more than casual.
---
Mc is in one evening clear on Saturday on Sunday. 
---
What are you people doing that you can only join a casual raiding guild. 
---
&gt; Imo: It ain’t really broke
---
You know what, I'm going to take the time to prove that you're full of shit. First of all, class balance exists in current content, this is pretty easily proven with http://www.simulationcraft.org/reports/T22_Raid.html. Worst class does 80% of the best class' dps. Well into viable territory. 
---
Now that this is out of the way, you claim that classes "feel like a reskin". I'm only going to look at caster dps, because I'm already going to be taking a good 10-15 minutes to look through this shit and I can't be bothered to do it for every class and every spec.
---
First of all, balance druid. Balance druid maintains DoTs on its target, and has a *balancing* mechanic between solar and lunar spells. 
---
Next, arcane mage. Arcane mages use their mana as a ressource, unlike other casters. They can drain their mana to do a lot of damage, but at the cost of it being temporary, which fits the spec theme. They will switch between burning their mana for high dps, then evocation, and then conserve their mana until the next burn phase. 
---
Fire mage, I can somewhat concede on that spec, it used to be very RNG/cleave based, which fits the theme, fire being unpredictable and spreading around. They removed most of the RNG element when they changed combustion because bad RNG felt awful. 
---
Frost mage, throwing a ton of tiny frost pellets all over the place while having great cc for pvp. Frozen orb is one of the few rare "skill shots" in the game. 
---
Shadow priest, I'm just going to copy paste because I'm getting tired of summarising everything: "The Shadow Priest rotation revolves around a build and spend/sustain style of play. You use abilities that generate Insanity until you reach the appropriate threshold (60 with the talent Legacy of the Void Icon Legacy of the Void, 90 otherwise) to cast Void Eruption Icon Void Eruption and enter Voidform Icon Voidform. Once in Voidform, you use a slightly different set of abilities to stay in Voidform for as long as possible. Once you reach 0 Insanity, you exit Voidform and the process repeats." You can't tell me that's not a unique and flavourful mechanic. 
---
I could go on, but I think I've made my point. If you think you're playing a "reskin" when changing classes, you're playing wrong. Every spec in the game has specific mechanics relevant to their class lore. 
---
Much less of a "reskin" compared to vanilla mage frostbolt spam and vanilla warlock shadowbolt spam. 
---
That was great. Funny because it's true. STV is brutal for a warrior. Hunters and mages will be a magnet. Rogues your level tend to leave you alone for the most part just because with WW axe overpower will two shot most rogues. I find it best to engage any hunters you see first and don't let them get the jump. 
---
Even with just traps, you'd have all the cc you need in most situations. Only problem is trap resists if you aren't survival
---
and if it isn't this system the net gain for Blizzard is zero. They want this to not have GMs deal with loot issues. Putting in the system where need binds it to you wouldn't help them. For them to be able to get out of deal with Loot they have 2 options. No loot trading (my personal preference) and just close tickets with an auto message that deals with loot or open loot trading for the 2 hour window.  Any other options only slightly decrease the loot tickets. 
---
Hey I whipped up a potential spec for you. https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/hunter-talents/?tal=0505000051511000000000000000000050250510303130
---
Essentially this build would be all about delaying combat with melee opponents until they get up inside your butt, then you can try and finish them off with melee prowess. For fighting against ranged characters I think you may want to get up close. I have no idea. You may still do more damage ranged with this spec. I also threw in a lot of pet upgrades because god knows you'll need it. If you happen to come across a mage who polys your pet just throw a rejuve pet on him and he'll pop out of it with that one Imp'd mend pet talent. If I had all the time in the world I'd give this spec a try but I don't. That being said don't let people shit on you for playing this spec. If you want to live that Rexxar truth then do it. A guild may even let you raid with them but remember not to be mad if they only gear you up with unwanted gear. You're going to be a burden for them.
---
Bruh, don't hate on a dude because he likes to relax and party, He probably Slays more in a week then you have in your life. so keep your shit attitude out of my game
---
&gt;&gt; the biggest problem I see on this subreddit regarding sharding is that people don’t actually know what it is
---
&gt;
---
&gt;You mention it might help on log in queues but sharding won’t affect queues, crossrealm does. How about understanding them yourself?
---
I'm not OP, but this is not necessarily true either? If there is a cap of a certain amount of players since that is the maximum that starting areas can handle, queues could keep the amount of players below that cap. If sharding is implemented, starting zones can handle more players and queues can start at a higher cap, right? I'm not trying to assault, I just want to know how things are working.
---
This guy could use a Tranq Shor, which happens to be necessary for several 40 man raid bosses!
---
YOu misunderstood me. If you're playing classic for the long term, then sharding (the short term, 1 to 2 week only) is a non-issue. Long term sharding would be very bad for Classic.
---
First time ever playing Classic WoW (I played ~50 hours many years ago during WotLK, I don’t remember anything about it).
---
Currently I’m considering the following specs/classes
---
- Ret Paladin
---
- Prot Paladin
---
- Tank Shaman
---
I fully realize these aren’t optimal specs but for some reason they sound really fun to me (based on the videos and guides I’ve seen about classic wow).
---
Anyone played these specs that can offer insight?
---
&gt; As for your last paragraph. I scrolled back through the primary comments  on this thread, and at least half of them are expressing an interest in  RPing on Classic and explaining why. So I'm not sure what positivity  you are expecting that you aren't seeing *any* of, because I am seeing plenty of positivity in response to an all-around negative post. 
---
I mean, the majority of comments are negative criticisms with insulting undertones, but whatever. Frankly I don't really understand how my post is negative (what part of "Happy New Year!" screams negative lol. I clearly came here with good intentions). It's been taken the wrong way by many people, hence the countless insults and criticisms, sure, but I have since explained myself to try and clarify my goal. I was trying to be helpful. I'm not out here looking to "convert" people or tell you that you "don't know what you're asking for". I'm not trying to be an asshole. I'm here to inform people, and give my opinion, so you can make your own decision. Case in point, my post is twofold: what to expect playing on a RP/RP-PvP server, and my thoughts on why BfA is better than Classic for RP.
---
&gt; You said it yourself: You are trying to convince people to RP on BfA,  that they don't know what they are asking for in RPing on Classic. "You  think you do, but you don't." 
---
See above. Also I disagree with the comparison to J. Allen Brack's "You think you do but you don't" quote. I don't think I ever said or implied that sentiment.
---
&gt; Several primary commenters have explained why they want to RP on  Classic, but you brush them off(or latch on to a single aspect of their  reply), then play the victim(nobody is lecturing you...) because you  didn't convince them? 
---
I disagree again. I haven't brushed anyone off. I've responded, joked, argued, and even agreed with commenters (which I got downvoted for lol). I've only just now "played the victim" 24 hours after my failed post - rightfully so considering the amount of shit people have given me for it - and only in response to you criticising me instead of my post. Fuck me for defending myself, right?
---
Frankly, I'm tired and want people to leave me alone so this thread can die already.
---
I don’t have kids but I have a wife and am taking part time masters classes so I know the time crunch is real. I prefer it this way, though. It feels more precious when you can play instead of mindlessly grinding for 12 hours a day with nothing to show for it.
---
Git gud and you won't have people leave. People don't leave good groups. 
---
"Just fucking pull omg."
---
How many of these kids will we still see after wc? 
---
Didn't know Lupos could do so much damage..
---
I believe you mean barmans shank in BRD?
---
What a diva
---
There will still be tons of players fighting for mobs, it's just how things are on new servers. Whether it's EQ, ESO, WoW, whatever...
---
Sharding becomes a thing when an instance of the zone gets overpopulated. It doesn't give you the zone to yourself, it has you and (an example) a 100 other players in it, then a 100 players in zone 2, etc.
---
It will do nothing to lessen your experience (unless your goal is to not be able to do anything), while it will help not ruin the experience of others who want to have something to do.
---
I've been playing time-locked servers on EQ and EQ2 for 3 years now.
---
Nostalgia is great, but people who think that the games should be released with all the bad stuff as well... That's just beyond me.
---
Why would anyone want server queues, unstable servers and 1000 players in Westfall fighting over 7 mobs...?
---
It's absolutely absurd, and would only drive players away.
---
thank u both!
---
currently lvl 12 on private server and feeling 100% the same. will be the longest half year of my live :*(
---
No changes means no changes. 
---
Servers crashing while you are on the boat and falling through the world with 100 other players lol. 
---
Not a bad pun. Clever. Have an Up.
---
Maybe its me, but i don't see any stickied census sadly, then again, if the census is only held is this subreddit, who knows how accurate it is as the results could be biased.  
---
so much truth in what u say.
---
you can btw autoloot with shift click :)
---
Are we talking Pug BGing? You can't really rely on a random BG group to dispell people yet alone expect a heal. I mean it's great if you can get them but never expect it.  
---
 
---
Any NaMMers????
---
He isnt hating
---
Are you not aware that like 90% of the users here are /r/wow users as well? And I'm pretty sure he's directing this towards the actual hundreds of posts here suggesting stupid changes so that classic will be more convenient or whatever 
---
I think your take away from this should be that you feel you are presenting something different than what people are taking from it. Like the saying, when everyone around you is an asshole, it's probably you. Not saying you are an ass, but I've been in the position where I feel like I'm making an argument in one direction, but that's not what is being responded to. It's beyond frustrating.
---
Beyond that, I'll respect your wishes and drop it.
---
Some people have lives and *some* people don't.
---
Doing an escort quest is like a gankers wet dream.  
---
Sure.  But if they did that they'd get a bad rep and no would run dungeons with them.  
---
That was the one :)
---
Why the hate?
---
Weapon chain
---
You laugh now but wait until the hunter in your group wants your cool stave for rping. 
---
I member
---
Lol it's a lot more than just a "feeling". Its historical precedence. When has blizzard ever NOT used the cheaper and easier option to solve a "problem"? ofc they will use sharding as they please!
---
Really depends on the class, but id say on most classes you want to be ~same level. On a new server as a fast, good levelup class you kill mobs that are above your level if it doesnt slow you down in downtime. And on slower classes like warriors you might want to be above the mob by a level or two.
---
But that depends on the playstyle too. If you hamstring kite, the mob level doesnt mean that much.
---
Can't wait to be tanking SM again for a hunter to roll need on the SM mail because they unlock mail at 40... oh boi the memories..
---
Congratulationth 
---
You won't be able to tell since their PC will still be on and you'll still see them online so you'll try to out do them then die aswell. The circle of WoW.
---
Grathz
---
For gear it's not ideal, but Hunters have by far the most DPS pre-60 because of how strong the pet is.
---
Boomers will cry because the game is too time consuming and on we go
---
What if the leavers are bad though. 
---
I don't think classic is for you if you want to change class balance. 
---
If your schedule allows for some flexibility I'd recommend the opposite of what most people in this thread do; go for a serious minded guild, not a casual one.
---
A casual guild is not going to care, probably, if you need to duck out early or what not, but if that mentality is alright you'll also probably get fuckall done, end up clearing MC and ZG ad nauseum when you'd manage to kill hakkar and Ragnaros a few times.
---
A more serious one though would be able to breeze through raids once tactics are down, hell we'd raid 8 hours a week on *beep* over two days and clear MC/BWL/AQ40 and Naxx, then half an hour to 45 minutes to clear AQ20 or ZG each. 
---
Playing with people bothered with efficiency is going to be more effective for you, but it also requires that you can put away the 3-4  hours undisturbed needed for raiding, and some time on the weekend/whatnot for consumables farming.
---
that place gave me literal chills 
---
Maybe if they had put on their glasses they would have seen the situation more clearly
---
Is it too much to just ask if a game runs smoothly? We do not all want to run the game on our old CRT monitor.
---
This post has been removed because it is not specifically relevant to Classic. 
---
Shadowmeld + amishot used to be amazing OPed, but they eventually nerfed it by auto targeting the hunter when he/she started the cast.
---
Orc's stun resistance used to be around 35% with rogue talents and an orc rogue that speced maces back when maces between 15% or 20% stun chance was pretty much unstoppable.  I used to beat warriors to death without even starting in stealth and other rogues were a joke with that much stun resistance combined with mace stun procs. 
---
Same to you, buddy.
---
Difficult to judge really. Wrath was fun but had major flaws. I loved the introduction of achievements, but it also brought in loads of spam titles and things like that. DK's where ludicrously OP, dungeon finder was released, multiple raid difficulties suck the fun out of raiding.
---
Multi size raiding did help small guilds survive but at cost of balance. Ulduar was a masterpiece and the hardmodes there was phenomenal, same with Obsidian Sanctum. Questing was great if a little linear, and phasing was a little annoying but really helped tell the story. Dungeon design varied, bosses where fun but no dungeon had the epic feel Classic ones did. I don't recall any particularly interesting things from crafting, unlike in TBC and Classic.
---
Lots of ups and downs. 
---
Same with TBC
---
positives:
---
+ class balance
---
+ professions
---
+ Questing (again a bit linear though)
---
negatives:
---
+ arena
---
+ flying
---
+ mediocre story
---
+ shattrath
---
I found Prot very viable... in PvP while healing.
---
I have a Magic Carpet 
---
Crusader was theory crafted to be the best back in the day.
---
Weapon skill does a great many things to several stats. It gives some crit, some hit, less chance of boss to dodge/parry/block and it reduces the glancing damage penalty. Cap for weapon skill is 315 but the bonus it gives has diminishing returns meaning the first 5 skill points from 300 to 305 gives you more raw DPS than 305-310 or 310-315.
---
In summerize it very roughly, you can expect a raw 1-2% dps increase for each weapon skill point from 300-305 after which it starts to fall off. Thus, a human tank (or fury warrior) with sword or mace will do 5-10% more damage than a gnome.
---
A paladin with Concecration and Improved Righteous Fury can tank any dungeon and never losing aggro.  
---
Shaman on the other hand, I'm not quite sure.  
---
They probably won't have any issue holding aggro on a single target, but will be much harder on multiple target I assume
---
Job? Social life? Family commitments?
---
The Chinese guilds often tend to make wierd decisions all over the place though. I've seen Naxx geared healers with intellect enchants on their weapons instead of 55 healing, and thats just the start.
---
My point is: Retri paladins is bad, even though nightfall makes them slightly less bad, but it is still a net loss on raid dps instead of having offtanks with nightfall spamming hamstring.
---
This is highly unlikely. It will be on needed, soulbound items. 
---
Here we even have a technical argument: the game doesn’t know HOW an item ended up in your inventory - it only knows whether it is boe, bop and or soulbound. You can have ffa, n/g or masterlooter, but the loot trading mechanic should be the same.
---
The real reason it makes no sense for actiblizz to limit loot trading to “greeded items” is that this is a comletely marginal case. If it is only on g items, loot trading is practically irrelevant. 
---
Misinformation.
---
There has been some testing on this. And YES, non-nightfall melee hunter can output some really good dps if well geared.
---
If on top of their good dps, you add Mongoose Bite capable of being cast on a 2nd target and they can compete closely with other pure dps classes.
---
The BiS weapon for a melee hunter is Corrupted Ashbringer.
---
Don't ask this subreddit. Every one here is hardcore into min/maxing and will hate you for even mentioning the wrong spec. Search elsewhere for your own sanity. 
---
I fail to see how you got from that post to claiming that sharding fits with the original team's philosophy. That post says the changes are a necessary due to Blizzard's cost management practices and policies, not a thing is mentioned about design intentions.
---
Besides, the original team's philosophy is frequently of questionable importance. Yes, it was their philosophies that created the game we love, but their intentions do not always align with how it went in practise. The debuff limit was a performance limitation, yet many people argue that the limit increases gameplay depth by adding to the list of things one must considered when composing a raid. I don't care to turn this into a discussion regarding the debuff limit, but this is just one way in which aspects of a game can be regarded as positive, despite the developer intending otherwise, as well as vice-versa.
---
The developers of Super Smash Bros. Melee certainly didn't intend for the various glitches such as wave dashes, but many of those glitches are what have kept the game's competitive scene alive for so long.
---
The point is, original design philosophies or intentions are not hard rules. What matters is how it actually played, not what the developer intended or was thinking about but never got around to.
---
I completely forgot about Distracting Shot.  Duh, I remember now.  That was the defacto way to do it even back then for the ones that remembered that skill.  Based off what I remember, I think Hunters had a wider gamut of skill, or whatever counts as skill, than most other classes back then.  In other words, the skill floor was low, so you saw a lot of stupid ones (which seems to be the case for most MMO archer classes), but the better ones did seem to stand out.
---
Based on what i am hearing i'm thinking that will be the best answer. If the raid is a Tuesday i should be able to get away with it saying "I'll need 3 or so hours tuesday but then not be on the wednesday" to the mrs lol. Pugs always wound me up back in Vanilla/TBC when i played as is. Lost count of the amount of times i wanted to kill people in TK pugs cause they would just leave after one wipe.
---
If I'm going to look at a butt for hours and hours, I'd prefer a female one
---
Dwarf Beast Mastery/ Marksmanship hunter was the very first class I ever played and is going to be my main character. 
---
I appreciate it that you feel that way and the effort you put into the post, but I prefer vanilla wow because it doesn't feel like a reskin to me like current retail does.  I'll even give you an update for making a quality post (beyond saying I'm full of shit).  I would add shadow priest to disc priest and demon Hunter that somewhat feel unique in current form.  
---
I mained mage in cata and legion (with playing before bfa) and every spec feels the same despite minor changes.  I can't even stand to try to play my warrior since it feels like a shitty rogue mostly. 
---
I played at a high level pushing mythic raiding and top 50 m+ times.  So I'm too familiar with different specs and play styles of classes.  Maybe my problem is that I've played an unhealthy amount and I'm a bit burnt out, but even between cata and legion the balancing &amp; skill pruning efforts resulted in me feeling the reskin effect.  Add to that the standardization of limited potion use, removal of buffs limited battle resses. Fights requiring 2 tanks no more no less, every healer having a "tranquillity and every tank a shield wall and the interaction and value of each class is washed down a lot (not to mention the reductions of raid size).  
---
That said there's a reason beyond just MMOs being out of style that wows subs have fallen to where they won't publish them.  There's also a reason many others are "full of shit" and feel like every class feels like a reskin, and we prefer vanilla.  It's 3 am here and I don't feel like making the effort to respond to your post beyond be this, but thank you for a quality response.  
---
We don't need to buy anything to play Classic.    
---
We just need a subscription.
---
$15USD/mo isn't exactly a massive risk.
---
And if they do end up fucking up Classic, we'll just jump ship back to the private servers.
---
Druids and priest can farm Dire maul east, warlocks got maraudon princesd mushroom and winterspring eyes. Hunter has tribute if its not fixed, and maraudon if it is. All classes can farm frostmaul ekos in a raid or use herbalism.
---
Druids and hunters and rogues can herb farm in ZG with a blood scythe.
---
Rigues can farm brd. All classes can farm world stuff like elemental earth
---
Didn't Seal of Wrynn used to suck before a certain patch? I recall it was like +4 Stamina +2 Spirit, and the item was uncommon quality, before it was changed
---
There's a dev somewhere right now going 'Man... That was what I meant all this time' 
---
Dispel Magic not on list... I get it's not flashy but still
---
I know how you feel. I have been obsessing over Classic ever since November 2017, and the wait is killing me. Sometimes I still cant believe Classic is actually happening after years and years of being told no. Since a summer 2019” release could be any time between June to September, and the first day of summer is June 21st, we still have anywhere from 5-7 months or so until the server actually launches. 
---
I agree, you can enter the world now and be amazed that it still feels really cool and immersive, like a real RPG should feel but you will sadly never get the urge to just run around and explore every corner of the world.
---
It already isn't 100% authentic classic. It's damn close though, still good enough for me so far.
---
Hunters only equip mail on retail -
---
Doesn't that make it relevant to classic?
---
yes
---
&gt; The gold disadvantage you're at as a result of being a quintessential piece of a raid group is phenomenal. It was frustrating then and it will be frustrating again. But that seemed like thats what people want (I wonder how many of them actually played in Vanilla or as a healer/tank class).
---
Some people like it, and it takes all kinds. I do think they get a raw deal though compared to the DPS classes.
---
Rogues of any level can stun 60s. It really pisses them off judging by the prolonged attempts to kill and camp me from even a single stun.
---
I agree completely on the whole static end. As a college graduate student who is much busier now than I was 12-13 years ago, I sometimes look back and really miss when I first played Classic back when I was a middle school kid with no obligations, no job, and not too many real life things to worry about, unlike today. 
---
I will have less time to play Classic than I did over a decade ago, but thanks to never having to worry about another expansion rendering all my level 60 gear and quests obsolete, I will be able to take my time and experiment with just exploring Azeroth, grabbing every quest I can find, seek out rare hunter pets and rare world gear/weapons drops, try out raiding on several characters and maybe even trying world PvP and try to get some PvP ranks on one or two characters. 
---
Path of Exile. It's honestly one of the best games I have ever played once you get passed the first few acts.
---
They have fucked up on some thing lately, but the overwatch team hasnt given into Activision shenanigans. They legit care about the game first. The classic team seems to be the same way, but I am a little worried too. The demo they released should not have been released because of how incredibly unfinished it was. I know many of those bugs will be fixed, but it makes me wonder of Activision made them release a shit demo just for the $$ and if that is the case, what other shenanigans will we see for a quick buck?
---
I'm optimistic that the actual devs have a solid, playable vision. I dont trust the higher ups in blizz/acti to allow them to see that vision made a reality. With how little information we are getting all we can do is speculate.
---
Thats what I am going to do, if I see Sharding, Loot trading or any other of that shenanigans I'll cancel subscription and go back to a private server. The best vote is with your wallet.
---
It's hard to screw up a recreation of a game.  Don't worry.
---
Funny thing I didn't have free infinite time at all back in vanilla. In fact, I'm gonna have more time (still limited, though) this time around 😅
---
Mor’Ladim was the bane of my existence. I spent a lot of time in Duskwood, and I swear if you even looked anywhere near his direction he would charge straight at you and brutalize you. I was so satisfied when I finally got the quest to kill him, and got a nice ammo pouch from it. 
---
I'm really into this. It also makes a great experience for low level players who happen upon the zone while leveling. They organically encounter a goddamn warzone with chaos and skirmishing, just as it should be. Does the lowbie stay in the zone to try and witness the glory? Do they just stubbornly keep questing? Do they get the hell out of there to protect themselves? Whatever the outcome it's sure to leave a vivid memory and make for a great story.
---
Same in Vanilla for most classes. Mages switch to fire in AQ and rogues switch between dagger and sword depending on gear. Other than that you're doing cookie cutter all the way to Naxx. The class with the most choice is probably the warlock who has three viable PvE specs but the warlock is such an outlier and quirky class, which ofc is why I play them! And the 10k shadowbolt crits ofc.
---
The classic team seem to genuinely love classic wow, that’s all we can ask.
---
Prot Warriors can grind multiple mobs at once. Granted they are not the fastest at killing mobs, but if handled correctly, they can earn good gold if you find a good farming spot. As long as you don't mind taking your time leveling up, it's always a solid choice. (Plus you will always be able to run instances)
---
From what you have said there, Pally sounds more like your flavor. They bring a lot of utility. 
---
spellpower and hunters never worked..thats a private server thing.
---
In short you get less XP per mob, but because you can kill more mobs you net more XP overall. You can also get through quests much quicker and lots of quests require a group.
---
The same people when classic isnt turning out to be that very specific iteration that only they can remember
---
i dont really want this, cause i  think they would fuck it up. plus of course it would not be the real classic experience.
---
I'll be honest with you, you're unlikely to be able to constantly respec, as it becomes VERY expensive. You can level up as one specialization and then respec at end game, however beyond that requires a lot of gold farming. I remember when I first got to 60 in Vanilla I spent about a week grinding for gold, just so I had enough to maintain my character for a decent period of time. Selling potions is always a good money maker. However if your going Warlock, skinning might net you more gold in the long run.
---
Skinning and leatherworking will gear you out while you level and into end game gear. Any extra skin you get can be sold for gold.
---
i hope u are right
---
/r/whoosh
---
People probably wont take you seriously as a tank shaman.....however.......I do distinctly remember playing with a tank shammy that was really good and impressed me with his skills/ability. Paladin is very versatile and you can pick between any role, while still providing decent amounts of utility.
---
Not in pvp
---
My hero.
---
I doubt you one shot ambushed hunters who had 1,7k health.
---
What changed is that people go to different length in twinking. Getting the medical pouch from Felwood is no rarity, 2x +100health on legs/head is often seen. 
---
The health is seriously crazy
---
One wipe does not necessarily constitute a bad group.  Leaving after one wipe and no social animosity makes the leaver childish and impatient.
---
&gt; TBC was so perfect too except for the flying.
---
It... really wasn't. It was damned fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed it and approved of all of them at the time, but the seeds of virtually all the negative changes to come were first planted in TBC, and flying was arguably the least of those.
---
TBC was when the focus of development shifted from world building to endgame. When leveling-as-the-game gave way to "the game begins at 70" and daily quests, max-level dungeons and raids centering around a unifying BBEG story line. This represented a fundamental shift in design philosophy, and because endgame dungeons and raids became the driving force behind the game's direction Blizzard eventually (and completely reasonably) wanted to be sure everyone would get to appreciate all the great content they'd put so much hard work into, which laid the groundwork for dungeon/raid finder, cross-realm grouping and everything else later implemented to make that content more accessible, thus minimizing the importance of community.
---
It was also when PvP went from a largely unbalanced but glorious mess focused on big, dramatic battles to a tightly-tuned esport that robbed it of all flavor. Quoting /u/JuanLob0, who [said it] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a7ctcf/survey_what_would_you_like_classic_to_be_and_to/ec2h4yn/) much better and more succinctly than I could:
---
&gt;On the one hand, arena is one of my absolute FAVORITE past times in WoW.
---
&gt;On the other hand, I think we can really trace the complete erosion of class identities to balance changes forced onto Blizzard by how much fun arena was / is. Arena is what ultimately required Blizz to give just about everyone an interrupt and hard CC, and for balance purposes blizz had to bar many classes absolutely iconic abilities (like bloodlust or warlock infernal).
---
&gt;Finally, and the absolute worst, arena really forced blizz to stop making weapons/trinkets with really fun effects and had to limit just about everything to flat, predictable, and homogenous stat boosts. RIP Thrash Blade and its ilk, RIP windfury, RIP RPG.
---
As I said, I enjoyed the hell out of TBC back in the day and cheered for all the changes it introduced at the time. Even now I appreciate what it was and think there's a lot of good to be mined from it content-wise (to say nothing of class design and spec viability). With the benefit of hindsight, however, I also see how TBC was the sea change that first set the game on the path it's followed to this day.
---
I was thinking about the same but just couldn't wait, my brother and I are now 2 lvl 30 rogues kiling everything that comes into our way and we're having a blast. I don't even think a moment about lost progress, as I'm just having a lot of fun
---
&gt; You're pretty naive if you think Classic is going to be any different. 
---
Indeed it's not gonna be different that the experience I had. Because I did not befriend everyone, specially not the best of the servers, nor the people that were intolerent. You have a lot of people in a huge game like this one.
---
And thanks yes I'll find them, sure about that. Needless to wish you the same :p
---
I recall going into the 2004 beta (not long after having completed the WC3 campaign and Frozen Throne) and I was in awe. To be able to explore the RTS games open world. To be able to walk through the mystic forrest of ashenvale. To be able to kill boars in Durotar just as I did with Rexxar in the WC3 campaign "The founding of Durotar".
---
Good times.
---
Each expansion of WoW has almost been like its own game, even though the core stays similar enough, so I wouldn't think of time spent in Battle for Azeroth as diminishing or repeating anything in Classic.  Don't worry.  If anything, you can see what the original story was that Cataclysm continued in each zone, which I think is still an interesting perspective.
---
Awesome bitch class. You nailed it lolol. So you rolling a hunter then?
---
wow social score?
---
I used to think it was a little hypocritical to use new graphics in Classic WoW, but you know, I realized each person has their own reasons for enjoying Classic, and graphics don't have to be one of them.  So yeah, I'll probably do the same thing as you.
---
Mage / rogue are the class that have a lot of possibility of farming.
---
Rogue can abuse stealth and pickpocketting. Mage can AOE a lot.
---
The best farmer in the game is mage 100%
---
did you forget to switch accounts??? LOL
---
For PVP weapon chain is highly underrated. Against any other melee, a good proc of that and it's insta-win.
---
It is pretty funny to me to see Classic fans hating on Legion/BfA for grinding when WoW in 2006 was still basing some of its design on the old era of MMOs where literally all you did was grind, and it showed in stuff like: the Argent Dawn/Scarlet Crusade tokens, getting almost any reputation to Exalted, the crafting materials needed for damn near anything at max level or just certain items (useful or not), all for stuff that was mostly not even comparable to gear from simply standing around half the time in a raid if you were a needed role or class.
---
The only actually bad thing I've seen from Legion/BfA (without seriously playing either one) is Titanforging.  Warforging is fine, in my opinion.  I like the concept and intent, but Titanforging's upper limit goes way too high.  Ideally, there'd be only Warforging, and it'd only go to +10 ilvl most of the time and only rarely to +15 and no higher ever.
---
Yeah I mean, dare to wipe 1 time, and you're a bad player that's not worth playing with, even if you don't wipe ever after. Right?
---
No mistakes are allowed. Ever. Even once. It's a game after all. Right?
---
No one needs to learn, you're either perfect or you're bad for life. Right?
---
Should I continue?
---
most items you can craft aren't that strong, I'm currently leveling a rogue with mining/engineering and I'm lvl 30 with eng on 220. Sometimes grendades can be usefull but it's not like a huge game changer, meanwhile the early head googles are kinda nice. Also just by beeing a miner you can get a lot of gold and pay for your mount at lvl 40 instanly
---
Hunters can farm dm solo if they're enchanting, tons of large brilliants. Best farm I know, rogues can go brd and pickpocket, but imo large brils are better
---
but that's also why you can sell the ores for far more than leather.
---
Good ol' warriors, always showing leadership when the situation needs it
---
That might be a good idea. We'll see when we get closer to launch! 
---
Well, they do have great sustain and damage. So surely there's a lot of great places to farm for warlocks!
---
This won't really answer your question, but there's a lot of outdoor places you're perfectly capable of farming as a lock.
---
Just a few outdoor farming examples that seem rewarding (to me) as a lock:
---
* E'ko farm mobs in Winterspring
---
* Shadowsworn Cultists in Blasted Lands - cloth and potions drops
---
* The ogres in Tanaris in the ruins - lots of cloth and potions drops
---
Not the best gold output, but hey it's something! Also not very well-known, so probably not a lot of competition.
---
Also, if you take enchanting for example, doing RFD runs could be rewarding. Lots of small radiant shards if you disenchant the blue boss drops.
---
Probably not what you hoped for, but it's something :)
---
I think I agree with a lot of what you're saying here really. It sums up a lot of great points but it was so extremely fun still. Arena was also my thing. The class balances they did to make arena work imo didn't take away from how the classes felt either. Idk I just thought it was really well executed with not a lot to improve on. I don't think it would be possible to do that with vanilla class balancing, as much as it worked in a non esport environment. 
---
I don't agree that the game started at 70 though. I think a lot of old content was still super fun and interesting and wasn't too far in the past yet to make that statement.  Sure people probably thought that way, but they probably also thought that during vanilla too. My only negative was that people couldn't enjoy the vanilla raids the same anymore. That was a really sad thing for me. 
---
Even though I was 70, I still hung out a ton in azeroth helping low levels from getting ganked in STV or elsewhere. To me TBC was truly expanding azeroth and not creating an entirely new game like I felt wotlk was doing. 
---
Okay so I was wrong saying it was perfect besides flying :p Got a little ahead of myself, but it was such a good expansion! 
---
They can do maraudon 3 boss farm, tinker, princess and rotgrip. Is about 40g/h  depends on the bleu's that drop. You just vendor them. Not worth disenchanting. 
---
If Dire Maul isn't released on launch it's the best way to farm gold for hunters and warlocks. That I know of
---
1-30 is gonna be the main period of this imo
---
Get AV snowballs and toss them at the tank to outperform him on dps with your two dots stealing debuffing slots. 
---
Yeah you gotta look close for the benis though 
---
That’s true, but personally I like to have more reliability and frequency with my sales. That’s just me though. 
---
Those things are already confirmed to be in though.       
---
We just don't know the details about how they'll work.
---
ncsoft has it's mobilegame now which is making them far richer than ever before
---
The funny thing is that more than half the time, in my experience, it is the bad players that leave.  It kind of makes sense if you think about it: If they're bad enough to not be able to do a dungeon, then they're probably too stupid to know how bad they are.
---
I wish every person that causes problems in whatever game or wherever could leave the same way, but of course it's not always that simple.
---
There is obviously two sides to this. I've played way too much of this game (both in retail and in ... less retail servers) so at this point my patience for people learning this game is pretty small. I'm happy to explain things if someone has questions, but I'm not gonna be the tutorial for some guy, there is other groups and guilds for that. I just want to get things done in a reasonable amount of time nowadays.
---
Haha you can always try to meme spec kill people, no doubt you'll be able to get some people. But a hunter without his bow is less than half his potential.
---
Having played a frost mage I get that impulse even in bgs. Even if a warrior runs towards me it doesn't feel quite fair to kill him 
---
Don't even start then.
---
You could always just pick a different class and faction than you plan on playing on classic. Maybe try out a meme spec for the lulz. 
---
There are also TBC and Wrath to consider. Even insta-max servers if you don't want to spoil the vanilla content so you can still enjoy raiding and pvp without spoiling vanilla content.
---
Yes, if you want to play on a pvp I recommend that you choose a pvp server but if you prefer a pve server I recommend that you choose a pvp but if you prefer an rp server I recommend that you choose an rp server unless you prefer an rppvp server because then I wonder if anyone is still reading but anyway because then I recommend a rppvp server.
---
I'd add in Ulduar style hardmodes, a slightly stripped down achievement system (dungeon ones where great imo, and things like loremaster, but we don't need 100 meaningless titles and forced achievement linking), and the wrath style of story telling was great. Phasing was great for story telling but made it annoying to quest with friends, so I'm on the fence with that one, love the cut scenes, although classic questing was so much more abstract it felt more natural, no here is a quest hub that leads to all quests and you never come back here.
---
I've been playing Overwatch and EUIV, also trying to collect old legendaries, just got Shadowmourne yesterday!
---
This. I was in the same spot. Played Warcraft 2 a fuckton and then when warcraft 3 was launched I was so exhilirated because of heroes and THEN World of Warcraft came and the feeling of wonder and awe. Actually being the Hero in this World and meeting all the awesome characters. Man this is the only thing I wish I could be able to do again! 
---
And how the fock is that relevant to warlocks?
---
Back in the days we picked the Server by which one is in the nearest datacenter. 
---
From over 20 years of gaming, my experience is that it is more satisfactory to fail some times, figure things out and overcome it all, than to get it all 100% right the first time and move on.
---
One of the greatest runs I had was a 4 man BRD clear, where we had a leaver (after two wipes) and we still managed to beat the boss 2nd try. 
---
When and where did they confirmed that? Post a link to a quote or video with what time stamp.
---
you do know that you can get a bigger screen without needing higher resolution...? They’re not strictly correlated...
---
It would make a lot of sense if their goals are to reduce tickets while preventing people getting fucked over.
---
Data center?
---
The main thing I'll be doing on the day before I pick a realm will be to check this subreddit to find out which realms the streamers will be rolling on.
---
So I can avoid those realms.
---
Given activision blizzards record you would be better off playing on a private server for free
---
I prefer pve so what now?
---
Though warriors do scale well with gear, you'll find that skilling blacksmithing while leveling is not particularly helpful. Blacksmithing is a very expensive profession and it's unlikely you'll have the gold to buy the mats you need for relevant gear recipes. You would be much better off going double gathering to ensure a mount pickup at level 40. 
---
But this is just my experience. Play the game however you want, blacksmithing on a warrior is great class fantasy
---
Ha, that exact thing happened several times.  I think what usually happened is that he could roll equally on any gear that no one wanted for their primary role if the group was nice, or only on gear that no one wanted at all if they weren't so nice.
---
This works out because if you need a replacement, it's usually because people are tired of doing the same thing every week and already have a lot of the gear they want, so you're really just raiding for a few special things like Drake Fang Talisman or Ashkandi.
---
In germany, all the wow servers were spread to different datacenters across the country. We picked the one in Frankfurt which was the nearest city to ours. That way we knew our ping would always be fine. 
---
--&gt; r/wow
---
woops, sorry
---
The thing is, having to solve tickets for loot mistakes is a made up problem. People claiming GMs would accept all loot 'mistake' tickets back then are either lying, didnt play vanilla, or heard about it from some friend or guy on the internet who supposedly did it. The truth is that back then, just like on private servers today, if you put in a ticket asking to trade an item to someone else, unless its coming from a know guild master, it gets ignored. Especially if its not the first time you're doing it. And its good that way. Only legit mistakes from a master looter in a 40 man raid should be corrected. Everything else, too bad. 
---
Blizzard dosent *need* to dedicate any manpower to answering loot tickets, they can just use trashcan. They just *want* to do it because it panders to the modern wow players who wont accept to be told no.
---
The whole 'wait and see' approach has 100% always turned out for the worst. Sharding will invade all aspects of the game and loot trading will kill the pugging scene.
---
It took me a moment to understhtand the joke, then I loled while brewing coffee at thickths AM. Take an up vote my friend.
---
Could you explain some more, I'm genuinely interested in how this works. Is it weaving in raptor strike between AA and normal rotation? Also mongoose is only when you Dodge ... I don't really get it
---
Can I borrow your crystal ball some time? 
---
Where did they confirmed that? They said looking into sharding..
---
Or simply they are bad, they know it, and they don't want the rest of the group to lose their time.
---
I'll keep trying to make it know that those things will ruin the game. If they do a demo and those things are in it. I'm out
---
Mara 3 boss runs are popular.
---
DM E you can solo lashers and satyrs by enslaving one of them.
---
DM N you can solo the first guard and doggos.
---
You can solo Incendius (not great gph)
---
You can solo scholomance (not great gph)
---
If you got enchanting ZF can be nice aswell depending on the math prices on your server.
---
I don't know how they all compare exactly next to mafes or hunter but know if you can hit the lockout within the hour it doesnt really matter that mutch.
---
Other warlocks ocer at the classic warlock discord might know some more: https://discord.gg/D6TrRkq
---
Spellpower gives bonus damage to arcane shot and volley. T2.5 gives hunters some spellpower (by which I mean plus spell damage) for that reason.
---
I've decided on priest but really not sure on race.
---
Night Elf is an option, not got the best racials but shadowmeld seems good. Plus I like the models.
---
Dwarves have good casting animations and have some strong racials, though they can look a bit goofy.
---
Humans are an option too, somewhere in the middle between both.
---
For Horde, Trolls have cool lore and cool racials, but they don't really look good in cloth armour most of the time IMO.
---
For Undead, they have cool animations and decent racials but they do seem overplayed. 
---
Dunno man. 
---
That leaves more dps slots open for me :D yay!
---
You could try wearing mail, a lot of it is more caster oriented, metal looking, and it's not like there are shamans in the Alliance.
---
[Loot trading](https://www.wowhead.com/news=288407/blizzcon-2018-restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel)
---
&gt;"Loot trading - in wrath we added the 2 hour window where you can trade. This will remain - you won't have to put in a ticket if you looted something accidentally. We couldn't take up the CS time."
---
Was wrong about sharding being technically confirmed, but they look upon it as a good tool ["especially in those early days"](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769548630#post-15)
---
roll rppvp
---
As someone set on rollin a troll warrior on launch I am so down with this haha
---
I raided naxx back in vanilla, i was also around 15-16 then. Ive also been raiding on private servers for around a year and a half now. I currently clear naxx every saturday with my guild, and we alternate BWL/AQ on sundays.
---
The main thing I can tell you is that if you're serious about raiding, its all about being able to commit to a schedule. Guilds dont just raid when they feel like it, they have fixed times every week. If you can keep 100% attendance to a guilds schedule, it won't be a problem, even if its a quite hardcore guild. Youre gonna have to find some off time to farm consumables, which might be difficult if you want to play a tank, but its never impossible. A lot of it will depend on your knowledge of the game and ability to get things done quickly.
---
You could always do what I'm doing and take it slow. I'm  not gonna speedrun the leveling and only level when I don't have anything else to do, maybe even run a dungeon or two if I have the time.
---
When I reach max level and cleared out the dungeons of my pre-raid BiS I'm just gonna find a guild that will run once a week and set aside a night a week to raid and then farm for the next raid, sprinkled in with making money and doing quests in my additional free time.
---
I'd say the best solution is to just implement sharding but say that they didn't since Noone will be able to tell anyway 
---
My youth
---
This is such a weird comment. Everyone has lives, some people play WoW, some people play hockey, some people do whatever other people do.
---
Why is your SCSI CD-ROM device listed as the yet to be released BD-ROM?
---
What do you mean, "far worse version of other character"? I didn't know that other classes could cast better versions of Blessings of Protection or auras.
---
Ohh my good, like, the adventures you can have in this game is so mezmerizing. Like, you can sit by the sunset and feel  the breeze and maybe make some life-long friends while youre drinking a cuppa tea in the sunset. Like oh my god this game is so beautiful I dont need a real life. 
---
Not entirely related, but I love how "tryhard" and "elitist" have become meaningless words used to insult people for not being assholes.
---
thats is something i also thought about. i will play on a normal pvp realm, but i am scared i will end up on a realm that is maybe dead after a few month. and character transfer like now will be not possible i guess. i am scared that could hurt me a lot, but i cant think of a way to avoid that possibility.
---
Like bros, lets just go for a stroll in the barrens today, can you imagine the amazing sights and sounds we'll see? like, animals walking by and then we can ding together.
---
Sooner or later the festivals, clubs and raves will start to bore you like nothing else.
---
Plenty of time for Classic then. 
---
Another factor that made the world so big was spending AT LEAST your first 40 levels only able to get around on foot. When it takes 10-15 minutes just to pass through a zone, you had to really plan and experience your journeys.
---
LIEK I CAN SIT ON THE COMPUTER WHILE STILL SITTING IN THE SUNSET I CANT WAIT FOR VANILLA TO FILL THE VOID IN MY HEART
---
lmao
---
If you can squeeze two raid days into a week, id say you are golden. Its the levelup + prebis stuff that takes more time than content like MC or BWL. In private servers people spend 1h+ getting buffs for the raid and then do sub 1h BWL and \~30-40min MC.
---
In AQ and Naxx, the thing you have is TIME. You know whats coming, so you can start preparing for the new instance very early. Gather potion materials and gold for months before the launch. If blizz does same scedule as in vanilla, you are going to have PLENTY of time to get everything ready and not do much materials grind when the instance opens (and you need to spend time running them).
---
I'm pretty sure it's used to insult people for being assholes. 
---
I had a deadmines run two days ago where we wiped nearly 10 times because only me and the healer were somewhat competent. Worst of all, I ran the entire dungeon just so I could get a drop from Cookie (the last boss) but when we wiped once on Cookie everybody left the group so I couldn't kill him.
---
It really seems like you have to make your own groups or else the group leader will invite basically anyone. Our group for example didn't even have a single leather armor user so everyone had to compete for loot. I'm worried for Classic to be honest, it's already hard to find competent people on a private server...
---
&gt;always clear all content due to the skill level of the players.
---
And you have loads of private server people that literally know the fights inside out, playing them for years.
---
Why is doing your job being an asshole?
---
Did you not see the posts in this comment chain? Re read them.
---
Dude look at the ops time. This is around 20 hours a week.
---
How is that casual. What does that have to do with having lives.
---
Boomkin is obviously a burst damage spec built for PvP. Most of the talents in the Balance tree that don't touch pure dps seem to reinforce that idea, like the Starfall cast time reduction associated with a stun chance "for some reason (PvP)", the Moonkin form with a gigantic boost to armor "for some reason (PvP)". And it makes sense because why would you design a limited ressource spec for sustained dps/PvE when you already have an infinite ressource spec (cat form) for sustained dps? 
---
The way I see it, the people who try to bring moonkin or elemental shamans inside raids are the same people who try to bring arms warriors instead of fury warriors inside raids.
---
Nothing everything revolves around raids and the most efficient talents for them, pretty sure in this context the person up above was talking about any other circumstance.
---
What has that to do with what I wrote?
---
If you can play around 20 hours in a week. 
---
Than you are not a casual player. 
---
What does that have to do with a job??????? 
---
&gt; Further to that and relevantly to Classic, why is it good/bad? 
---
Nobody HONESTLY know how and if blizzard is going to do it. But people complain just to be sure that they get what they want. Im 100% sure there will be a PTR of some kinds or open beta, you will know ALL of it before the launch.
---
But since you dont know whats going to happen, people speculate. And then bitch based on that speculation.
---
I am pretty sure alot of the devs have stated they where not happy whit clas balance in vanilla but fixing it is not a small thing. You need to look at talents and gear and you can't just look at pve. This is why we got huge talents and gearing changes in TBC. Now this is not me saying I want any changes to balance in classic I don't I wan the game as it was. Just don't use the argument that blizzard was happy whit clas balance and that's why it is the way it is 
---
Yeah i raided a lot back then, but i remember spending 10+ hours of constant wiping in Naxx... Was brutal. If i can get a raid day once in the week and one at the weekend or something i can manage the schedule (Big unavoidable things not withstanding, Weddings etc but i know them months in advance haha) 
---
Well i remember i used to farm for stuff fine back in vanilla as prot warrior, Though i think i teamed up with my mage friend and the two of us used to go farming to chill and farm. Also him being herb/alch and me being min/eng meant we could get profession stuff while we were farming other things we needed.
---
Also known as the Lemming Strategy.
---
Not everything revolves around raids and the most efficient talents for them, pretty sure in this context the person up above was talking about any other circumstance.
---
Because you're usually being a dick about it. 
---
Lets assume that's the case, did you consider that maybe they wouldn't have to be dicks about it if people weren't being assholes in the first place?
---
[Check this video out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEMYXPmW4kc)
---
Sorry you asked 'what are you people doing that you can only join a casual raiding guild'. Looks like i took it out of context.
---
&gt; There will still be tons of players fighting for mobs, it's just how things are on new servers. Whether it's EQ, ESO, WoW, whatever... Sharding becomes a thing when an instance of the zone gets overpopulated. It doesn't give you the zone to yourself, it has you and (an example) a 100 other players in it, then a 100 players in zone 2, etc.
---
I never asked for your help to explain what it does. 
---
&gt; It will do nothing to lessen your experience (unless your goal is to not be able to do anything), while it will help not ruin the experience of others who want to have something to do.
---
Yes it will. You fail to see the bigger picture. 
---
&gt; Why would anyone want server queues, unstable servers and 1000 players in Westfall fighting over 7 mobs...?
---
Your biggest problem is that you are so fucking stuck up in your own asshole that you can't for the life of you see any other solution than your own. 
---
I wish I had an answer.
---
Back in the day I had a guild before release and the guild leader made the choice. 
---
Probably pick a random pve server with medium or low pop on release. 
---
Fury being (mostly) a joke and arms being King.
---
Hunters being the anti-rogue (pet mechanics, hunters mark, flare CDs).
---
Really just the whole chain of flavor of the month for class mechanics.  The majority of vanilla WoW was not class balanced(especially dps/threat) the way private servers/1.12 are.
---
&gt; Those other people trying it out at launch and quitting because they can't actually do anything? Sharding will chase those people away for good which is bad for the Classic community.
---
&gt; 
---
If they are chased away because they have to wait for a respawn in the starting zone then they will quit by Westfall anyway. I fail to see the point here. 
---
This is a virtual CD ROM device created by the software DAEMON TOOLS PRO.
---
I have to say I'm not 100% sure here but i believe you will be able to play classic whit a subscription only. (Comes from blizzard saying that everyone whit an active bfa subscription will be able to play) This is not saying there might not be a collectors edition to buy 
---
&gt;Our group for example didn't even have a single leather armor user so everyone had to compete for loot
---
Thats pretty uncommon, if im on a alt, doing a instance i WONT get invited if the group lead is the same class as me. Even if im overlevel and overgeared for it (well he cant know this, but still).
---
No, I want to see everyone. Absolutely everyone, not 50, not 500 - I don't want the cheap MMO experience, I want the FULL experience. The massive multiplayer experience. 
---
A bunch of drunk Russians managed to get 13k players on a stable launch, don't tell me Blizzard Entertainment can't do the same. 
---
Keep in mind that Orcs get an extra 5% pet damage. That is really useful.
---
How did you find out where the data centres were?
---
Where servers live for all different types of companies. Usually the buildings are secured with bio security.
---
Human's have always been the most visually impressive priests in my book. 
---
AA, WG, Raptor and potentially Mongoose.
---
Get a warlock's doomguard to hit you while you're dpsing boss. There's a whole guide somewhere on how to make sure its doesn't die, positioning, threat, etc..
---
P.S. There also a small chance Unconscious Dig Rat could attack in Vanilla, which would help also.
---
Maybe you just have to buy WoW. And a subscription. So no expansions but just the original game.
---
Oof, Daemon Tools. I remember that tool fondly, it's a shame they eventually turned out to be spyware; at least that's what I was told.
---
Even for tank/melee losing out on 4 stamina but gaining secondary stats (agi, spirit) is a good tradeoff for leveling.
---
Rogues can have problems with a soul link warlock in decent gear, you gotta burn through the locks natural high hitpoints, soul link, master demonologist and magic armour then you also have double sacrifice and healthstone whilst you're being whittled down by pet damage, corruption, agony and immolate. It's pretty brutal.
---
Didn't they discontinue that? Until bfa you had to buy the Battle Chest (which was classic+tbc+lk) + whatever the current xpac was. But now with bfa you only have to buy bfa. So, as of now, there's no way to buy a "wow" base product.
---
Where did you find the data center location? On the wow page?
---
&gt; maybe they wouldn't have to be dicks about it if people weren't being assholes in the first place?
---
No. People are dicks when making understand people they should do their job correctly, instead of helping them to do so, which is the base mindset of any MMO.
---
Elitist and asshole, are words used for people that don't consider WoW as a game, but as something else where people either do exactly the same as them, perfectly, 100% optimised, with no mistakes, or they reject those people and/or think them as bad. There is no in-between for people like that.
---
They could just stay quiet, do their perfectly refined thing, try to play with less good player and help them, or rather stick playing with their perfect friends or guild. But instead they flame people, tell them to get good, they do their best to shut down everyone that does not play perfect classes in raids, even if they are not directly concerned by that. And a lot of them, yes, will leave dungeons upon the first or second wipe, even if it was common 14 years ago to occasionally wipe in dungeons. And even worse, they think their opinion should be the norm, and speak loud everywhere with pride and arrogance to tell people they should think like that.
---
Those people are elitist assholes, 
---
This post is underrated.
---
How funny! I love things like that - it really shows how creatively you had to think as a 40 man group.
---
It's only a subscription and you won't have to buy anything. 
---
Current retail WoW servers are available for free up to level 20.
---
If you subscribe, you'll have access to (eventually) WoW Classic and all content that isn't exclusive to the current expansion (BC, WotLK, Cataclysm, MoP, WoD, Legion).
---
If you buy the box for the current expansion (Battle for Azeroth at the moment) then you'll get access to the content that is exclusive to that expansion as well. 
---
&gt; Those people are elitist assholes.
---
Sure, but those aren't the only people being called elitists.
---
Aan, could be don't know tbh. But in that case, if you don't have an account where wow was bought on then I guess BFA and subscription. Doesn't seem logical to just use subscription if you didn't play any form of iteration of the game itself.
---
Same, I hope there aren't that, many big streamers that stick with classic, with no arenas ir achievements etc hopefully they move on quickly
---
&gt;Also any NPC rogues yo u could pay for information?
---
I'm 99% sure none exist, unless you mean paying NPC Rogue trainers to "inform" you about new skills.
---
So, you suggest to code on 27monitor with 1080 reso?
---
Can you at least imagine how symbols will lookd here?
---
Cool, do you think NSA might be watching my Excel spreadsheets?
---
100% maining a warrior named Miketython
---
If you get lucky you can find hardcore guilds that don't raid much but manage to hang(or even surpass at points) with the top guilds on the server/faction.  I think for both EQ2 and WoW I managed to find the unicorn guilds that raided max 3 days a week for 3-4(? been a while) hours while keeping up with the hardcore 5 days 3-4 hours a day guilds.  Really did wonders for my life balance and when it was raid time everyone was dialed in.  Much less turn over too as people did not get burned out nearly as much.
---
I donno, grow some balls? lololol
---
That could work!
---
I feel pretty much the same. I have ZERO faith in Blizzard these days. Their recent shenanigans were the last straw. I've played since mid-vanilla and quit permanently a couple months into BFA because the game is just an empty husk of its former self. Tired of them dumbing everything down and sacrificing fun for profit.
---
It's become a mindless loot grind. It might as well be a single player game because nobody ever talks, and if they do it's usually toxic bile.
---
I'm a #nochanges kinda guy. I don't even want battlenet integration. I want it to be exactly as it was, bugs and all. It won't happen though. 
---
I don't understand why they're changing the loot rules... Ninjas will be ninjas and the best part about stand alone servers was that people would get a bad reputation for stuff like that and then would never get invited to groups. 
---
You could get server famous back then by being a bad ass. Guilds were well known. Individual players became well known crafters on their respective server. 
---
Anyway... I could rant for hours. But all said and done, blizzard need to fuck off and die... or cut the shit and give us what we want. 
---
Well *somebody* has to check whether you sin with VLOOKUP instead of our glorious INDEX|MATCH-overlord.
---
*random player runs in and starts the The Blackrock Stadium event while people aren't ready*
---
*random player accidentally pulls the whole room before The Beast*
---
*Random player starts attacking mobs in BRD tavern and aggro's the whole damn room.*
---
You wont need anything but a battle.net account and a sub for wow to access classic, they changed it recently.
---
You did absolutely nothing to answer anything.
---
But nice job on the internet insults.
---
What exactly is "the bigger picture" if there is sharding for 2 weeks and then gone once the servers stabilize? Do tell.
---
Damn! I remember having 256MB RAM in the Beta I think. The Gryphon-Ride from SW to Westfall always ran in like 0.5FPS.
---
*mental note to avoid STV and Tanaris*
---
*launch day arrives and goes to STV and Tanaris anyway*
---
*Get's ganked. I am extremely angry now and I want revenge*
---
*Precedes to waste time in STV/Tanaris for hours instead of leveling*
---
Now you got a super computer with almost instant load times to play a game with 12 year graphics :D. 
---
In raids I had to zoom in and look at corners/the floor to get better fps. :(
---
Well a 7950 is not really a 2160p Card, but Classic WoW shouldn't be too hard on the GPU. 
---
Im pretty confident that most streamers will roll PVE servers, so im good there. Because they will get rekt in stream sniping all day, every day.
---
It used to be when connected to a server (simply being having server selected ie in character select/create screen) you could pull the ip address and run a tracert. 
---
I only did this when on US servers as, being a brit in britain, all EN-GB servers had fantastic ping for me considering the size of this island.
---
Whether this method will even be relevant is another matter. The doomsayers claim blizzard are going to try pulling cloud hosting which, not being all that knowledgeable, sounds like a bad situation.
---
It's silly that Blizz made all 2h sword users bad in pve though
---
Hakkar isn't exactly "the content" I would be interested to see prot tank naxx and AQ
---
Dont wanna sound like a douche here, but these are so easy peasy. Just need to stay at certain locations
---
Your raid was given the same ID as another raid, so you both entered the same instance. Nothing more to it really.
---
I could look at this for hours and still love it
---
So if I understand correctly, one price for both retail and classic? Retail pending on if we own the latest exp? 
---
Or getting teleported under Alterac Mountains on the boat after loading screen instead of the correct destination.
---
I can't believe I have to keep explaining this. The #nochanges ship has sailed. 1.12 mechanics and talents + 1.12 dungeon itemization + MC as top end content is already a massive change. No changes is simply not on the table anymore based on what is confirmed by Blizz. You get two choices:
---
Radically different environment + original MC tuning = shit game with changes
---
Radically different environment + MC adjusted to compensate = good game with changes
---
People obsessed with the numbers are idiots. The numbers DO NOT matter. The experience does. Recreating the EXPERIENCE of vanilla is what matters. That means wiping, that means slowly progressing through the bosses. Those are the experiences that forge guilds. A Classic with different tuning values that delivers that experience is more authentic vanilla than a slavish devotion to copying every detail of something that is already drastically different than what it was. 
---
I feel like I'm having an argument with Groot here, except you guys only know 2 words instead of 3.
---
Couldn't you queue for BGs as for example level 29, ding 30 while in queue, equip full level 30 gear from the auction house and then go in and wreck?
---
Oh my sweet summer child
---
Yes. 
---
Classic and all of retail except the latest expansion: 15$ a month subscription
---
The latest retail expansion: 49.99$ one-time purchase
---
Ranged Hunter is barely viable as is. 
---
Oh the nostalgia . . . and the slightly tragic awareness that I can place that quote better than I can remember most things I've studied. Imagine if they made an MMO of English Literature or Computer Science . . .
---
So many idiots thinking that Nightfall [insert shitty spec] works.
---
It does not.
---
Which I acknowlege if you read my comment. For everything but raiding the talent system is pretty sweet, except maybe the 50g respec cost.
---
Sure. It's called the wow forums, or MMOChampion. There's multiple crystal balls out there in fact!
---
You know how they say the tourists are going to check out classic and then drop out?
---
Well this place is going to be their graveyard for so many.
---
&gt;How is sharding cost cutting?
---
My guess is simply that they don't need to "fix" it, which means no development time to remove existing features from the current engine.
---
Trust me I'd rather have lag than sharding, but I've a feeling Blizzard won't agree on that.
---
Yeah but the whole pvp thing?
---
That is genius, and is how I will deal with all my enemies lol
---
For some reason when it comes to classic I just trust Blizzard that we won't see phasing in these scenarios. No clue why.
---
Surprised they actually did it that way 
---
I believe thith would be the proper pronunthiation. 
---
I did play vanilla and can prove it if you like. You didn’t say soon. 
---
Here here!!
---
You can farm Eye of Shadow in winterspring/blasted lands with fear/enslave demon.
---
Because you cook up false premises with server queues/unstable servers when its proven that this does not have to be the case. 
---
None for you, friend.
---
&gt;pronunthiation
---
pronunthiathon
---
Pick one with a name you like. 
---
And they refuse to cc, as its not as fast to just charge in and aoe everything. 
---
Im hoping most of them will accidentally drop their Hearthstone in the middle of Gnomeregan. 
---
Where did I suggest that?
---
Tryna go priest as it's always been my main. Going disc at 57 until a raid comes out after MC/ony.   
---
Really conflicted because I want to go feral druid and tank instances up to and including lvl 60 dungeons and MC/BWL if they let me. Being a feral as do or tank sounds super exciting. I especially want to do this if tanks are in high demand on the server. However making it work will be alot of work especially on the DPS side.   
---
Only ever played feral druid as a twink in TBC @ every bracket, so making it my main would be exciting
---
Realistically, there is only one ability available to do DPS, raptor strike, and it is on a 6 second CD. MB requires the hunter to dodge an attack to activate. So, what you have is a rogue with no special abilities at all doing white damage and mediocre yellow damage every 6 seconds. So not viable at all. At least a Retardin has some dedicated melee abilities intended for sustained melee dps. A hunter has none.
---
20 alliance and 20 hordes zoned into a 40 man raid, which acts the same way as any other zone, so world pvp inside the raid. :-)
---
They were always used for that. 
---
Sounds amazing, where did you find this info or did you tested yourself ?
---
If you put in the time you can do anyting. Except maybe moonkin and Ret as far as raids go
---
I had this scenario recently too. Playing my human warrior, lvl19, tanking in DM on a private server. The rogue keeps ranged pulling three elite mobs and expecting me to instantly drag aggro from all three while he DPS as hard as he can. By the time I've taunted one, generated rage and pulled the other two using sunder armour, the priest is OOM from healing the rogue and we wipe. I said to the party that the rogue needs to stop doing this and ALL 4 other party members blame me for not being fast enough at pulling aggro, being a shit tank, etc.
---
This was a pug, they weren't friends or anything. All blamed me. I am going to do my best to run classic with a priest friend and if I'm a warrior, if some random DPS pulls in the instance fine. If they refuse to change and keep pulling, we'll let him die. 
---
Wrong, spellpower affects serpent sting with a high, full coefficient. Also affects arcane shot although arcane is a hybrid shot that iirc benefits from spellpower but also from talents that improved your physical shots. Fire traps didn’t benefit. And then there were plenty of proc items that could benefit from spellpower. 
---
Sacrifice/Feign death/ice block not being in the list is really sad.
---
Or Asmongold
---
what should we do? burn down blizzard hq?
---
I have a feeling most are going to go back to their original servers, as classic guilds are reforming. My original guild is getting back together after breaking up during TBC and we are all rolling right back on Sargeras. 
---
There are some searches you can do to find the populated realms during the good ol days and I’m sure they will be like that again.
---
This really is the beauty in the whole thing. For once we actually have some leverage.
---
I have no issue with sharding in the starting zones, past that I would not play the game.  Posts like this that are just whining and have no solution are pretty worthless.
---
Omg, when I was a N00b and playing the first toon I got past level 20, a ret pally, I got this off the AH and  I thought it was the best thing ever!  A more experienced friend just shook his head at my noob-ness and told me about [Verigan’s Fist](https://www.wowhead.com/item=6953/verigans-fist) and that I should’ve just gotten that for free. 
---
How would they get into MC together? How would they even get on the same id? Was this like a 1.1 bug?
---
&gt; sharding it will ruin everything.
---
&gt;this would stop me and my friends from playing the game.
---
&gt;  the game to be ruined
---
Actually I would be happy not to see hysterical AA++ hyperbolizing people in game. But sadly you are going to be playing this game anyways, because that's the nature of whiners. 
---
If you're a tank you should be the group leader always so you can kick people like this.
---
Sharding doesn’t exist or exists with specific rules on RP servers. The work has already been done to limit its use in situations where it significantly impacts the world as it is intended. The code exists and won’t require massive change to implement.
---
All they have said is that they intend to use it initially to deal with the starting zone rush.
---
Repeating “you’d better not be lying” doesn’t serve a productive purpose nor will saying it have any impact until they change their stance. It just makes blizzard put you on their ignore list.
---
This charming interaction about the respective merits of dicks and assholes reminded me of this legendary speech: "We're dicks! We're reckless, arrogant stupid dicks..." https://youtu.be/zcAaertdaQk
---
Blizzard is very aware of this community’s opinion on the matter. They’re either going to listen, or they’re going to do their own thing. They’re not doing it out of spite, they’re choosing what they think is best for the game, whether they’re mistaken or not. 
---
No amount of these threads restating the same thing over and over is going to change their opinion. They’re most likely no longer reading them, because they are well aware. 
---
&gt;Wipe on cookie
---
I'm sorry you what
---
This threads is awfully familiar to every single other thread that's like: "in my opinion these changes wont change anything". Opinions, people, different, box, pandora....things and stuff...
---
Yupp. But since the raid had a cap of 40 players, only 40 out of the 80 players who tried to join would get it, so it could be 1 alliance 39 horde for example. My guess would be a random number generator generated the same ID twice and gave it to two different raids. Think about it as throwing a dice, sometimes you land on the same number twice in a row. Was a bug at one point, not sure what they did to fix it.
---
Sharding in the starting zones is a good idea, stop being over dramatic.
---
I don't think anyone has a "real" life, and my life is definitely not for everyone.  
---
The festivals and raves aren't all about the drugs but more about the music and the people.  
---
One of the reasons I love Classic so much is because of the social aspect of it all and how connected the community is...I find a lot of that in the rave culture as well.
---
He's not your friend, guy!
---
This is an awesome idea, and probably what I'll end up doing. I want to level like I did back in vanilla and not care about how fast I hit max level and just enjoy it all at my own pace.
---
i want to play a game where i am actually able to do 40vs40 world pvp and not being phased into another shard while fighting lmao. so no i wont touch this game if sharding stays after starter zones
---
Lol I understand how rng works. I play WoW after all.
---
If you spam sunder amor to take aggro back on 3 mobs after a dps pulled, you're indeed a bad tank :/
---
tbc is a great time, the introduction of Arenas was a game changer, as well as more manageable raids.
---
"Cutting" was probably the wrong word to use...it's more like I just don't put aside as much time for them as I used to.  
---
I'm not proud of having less time for games now, I'm just happy with my life overall. I think that if something makes you happy and it doesn't cause suffering to those around you, you should do it, whether it's videogames or bike-riding or whatever.  
---
And there's nothing wrong with being a hippie my man ☮
---
Dude. As a no changer... these are the QoL changes we need. 
---
&gt;here we even have a technical argument
---
It is 100% in their power add a couple lines of code that supersedes BoP/BoE for loot trading; they could easily have it like u/hansjc says, pretending they can't is just disingenuous. 
---
Any1 know when they release it? 
---
Did you read any of the AMAs here in this subreddit? Vanilla devs literally admitted some specs being completely unviable for raids was NOT intended. 
---
The only time I left a group  was in WC before we started the "real" instance. We were outside going to the instance portal and we decided to kill the goblin for the alcohol bottle quest. I didn't had the quest so I asked to share like 10 times and not a fucking one of these dumbfuck shared the quest... once the mob was dead they all shared it, I left
---
Actually saw an interview with Metzen the other day, where he legit started crying because he talked about the characters of OW. He fucking loved that job man.
---
And yes, they are currently trying to fix the shit that OW got, and it seems they are trying to go in the right direction. 
---
And Blizzard's ignore listen hold more than 50....
---
Classic server will be less populated than Pserver so I would go with the good old farm like E'kos, Satyrs, high lvl humanoid and earth elemental 
---
Does that sell well?
---
Just means that pservers get better since they have a more recent client to build off of. So more stability and less bugs for pservers, and we don't have to pay blizzard money if they fuck up classic.
---
Yeah I was thinking more dungeons but I will research more out door stuff too. I guess depends on how popular the sever is.
---
I will have a look over there too. Thanks for the information.
---
Hmm, going through content patches I can clearly see the main focus of the ongoing WoW development, even if you just take vanilla. 
---
It's quite obvious to see, and it's NOT leveling. 
---
I disagree and I'm an experienced roleplayer who still currently roleplays on BfA. The main thing I disagree with is extra lore: the lore has gone to complete and utter shit in game. It barely makes sense half the time and the endless monotony of repeated near-misses of total world destruction in the form of Deathwing, the Legion returning and god forbid every single little thing written in Warlords of Draenor, the world feels a whole lot less compelling and enjoyable for me to play and write stories in. 
---
I love Classic WoW because the story and world feels alive, it feels significantly more open-ended and everyone just feels a little less "world breaking important", over all it just feels more real to me--- which, yes, I understand its high fantasy and asking for low fantasy in high fantasy is ridiculous but sometimes high fantasy can be taken too far. 
---
The Defias Brotherhood, the Bloodsail Buccaneers, the Syndicate, a lot of the in-game factions just felt more present and there and there were many enemies in the world instead of just one, and some of the 'bad' factions actually weren't even that bad: like the Defias Brotherhood. 
---
It just seems better to me for roleplay from a story perspective. Yes, I'll miss transmog, and various little QoL things that have been added in the game since that help with roleplay, but if that's the price I have to pay for a world that actually seems fleshed out and enjoyable to me, its the price I'll pay.
---
Of cause anything is possible. Is your strongest argument that loot trading is only for g items because it could be?? Not very strong at all. Wishful thinking at best.
---
I can count the number of times in dungeons in which your version of loot trading would have been used om very few hands: zero.
---
Just imagine that not just 1 or 2 DPS players perform as bad as a Ret, imagine most or maybe just half or just a third of the raid's DPS deal as little damage. You clearly start to struggle with progression then. 
---
A meme spec that's naturally performing badly requires the rest of the raid group to perform better than what's usually needed for that raid. Impact might be smaller (if it is just one meme spec or the players play their class exceptionally well) or bigger, but it's still getting carried. 
---
Get one in your time zone. It should ensure you get a good ping, and peak time will likely match up with when you're available. Raiding in particular is painful if you're in a different time zone. 
---
Thats like half of the quests though lol
---
I never made an argument, just pointed out yours was clearly wrong.
---
When running from one continent to the other, sure
---
and also because Kurzen's Compound is inspired by Vietnam film Apocalypse Now
---
One ligitimate reason to keep sharding around after launch: it daves money on server cycles. U never heard that before huh
---
Man I agree so much. The older I get the less interested in video games I am. I essentially played everything that interests me and there are not that many new games that I'm interested enough in to try them out.
---
But Classic WoW is essentially the only retro game that is still on my list. There is so much left to discover and to try out.  I just want to go back to that world I could never experience fully.  Just half a year and we can play it. I'm so excited.
---
I think you do not see the big picture here.
---
What we know for sure is this: sharding will be limited to the first few weeks, and only for starter areas.
---
You are "pretty sure" that it will stay afterwards.
---
I am pretty sure that it won't. Why? Well, simple : if sharding will be permanent, Classic WoW will be the fastest DEAD game in history. Which means that Activision, the greedy corporation that killed Blizzard, will lose a big, fat income source.
---
I am not even going to mention Blizzard from now on, as an entity. Blizzard no longer exists. Activision wants MONEY. And with Classic, they know exactly how they can make money : Classic being as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
Sure, they are starting with 1.12 and everything it means (itemization, debuffs, talents, etc.). Sure, they plan a weird content release. Sure, they plan loot trading (we still don't know how and even IF it will be actually implemented in Classic).
---
But all of the above are ACCEPTABLE enough to the vast majority of Classic player base.
---
Sharding on the other hand...it's a red line for a HUGE part of the players. If Activision keeps sharding, Classic will die, and with it, the income source.

Activision is a greedy corporation...but they aren't stupid. They can do whatever they want with retail WoW, Overwatch, Diablo, etc. They can sell red dots and mounts, and skins, and heroes, and whatever they want, and make loads of money...BUT outside Classic WoW, because the ONLY reliable source of money from Classic will be off subscriptions.
---
Sharding is an option that saves money...but not for Classic WoW. Because WITH sharding in Classic...they won't have a game that saves money.
---
They won't have a game.
---
Period.
---
It’s kinda hard to do a dungeon run with people who don’t understand the dungeon if you normally get through it with friends or your guild quickly with zero issues. 
---
I basically will never run with a PUG unless I know the healer or the tank, usually I don’t go unless the group is at least 3/5 people I know.
---
&gt; OP was asking how it could be changed so that more specs would be viable in endgame raiding. Sorry if OP started a thread about a topic that does not interest you, but you don't need to threadcrap all over it just because it is not for you.
---
I didn't. I suggested alternatives. Most grown ups tend to appreciate this.
---
&gt; We've gone beyond the mere stupidity of "lol everything about this deterministic computer game is just a matter of opinion" and into the true idiocy of "if you close your eyes the numbers in the computer game don't exist".
---
There's nothing stupid about it. The objective of playing a computer game is to have fun. We all have different ways of reaching that objective.
---
&gt; A minute ago you were whining about how selfish people were for wanting offspecs to be viable in raids, because it would spoil the fun you thought you would have by playing them in raids and sucking balls.
---
Show me a single example of "whining." And, no, I didn't say it would spoil any of _my_ fun. I said that buffing offspecs impacts many other players besides you who have different motivations. As an example, I used the melee sorceress in D2 to illustrate my point.
---
&gt; Here is a complete list of ways to kit yourself out in a full set of AQ40-equivalent purples or better without raiding:
---
Then raid!
---
&gt; The OP decides what the topic is. If you really think the world needs a discussion about a different topic you can go start your own thread titled "DAE enjoy playing failed specs in endgame PvE so much that they don't want them fixed?".
---
I wasn't off-topic. I suggested an alternative.
---
&gt; Actually we have Word Of God from multiple vanilla designers that they wanted every spec to be viable and they failed to achieve this. So if you really want to fulfil the desires and vision of the OG designers you should support class revisions to achieve that.
---
It's not unreasonable for the original designers to feel like they could have made the game even better in some manner. However, this is what you said:
---
&gt; &gt; It's not some weird kind of entitlement for someone who levelled their paladin smashing evil with a big hammer to want to smash evil with a big hammer in Naxxramas.
---
The designers of vanilla decided to make paladins smashing evil with a big hammer in Naxxramas very difficult.
---
&gt; But your goal is just to be a special snowflake by deliberately playing a PvE raider who is bad, right?
---
Nope, my plan is to be a worthwhile raider that helps clear the content. I'll go back and kit out meme specs when I've cleared the game. I've got a long term view of this game. I think you keep trying to put that "special snowflake" label on me, as if all you have to do is get it to stick, and you've won the argument. "Special snowflake" is a _child's_ argument.
---
&gt; Why do you have to have Blizzard hand that to you on a platter for you to mindlessly follow?
---
I don't.
---
&gt; I am sure there will be some way to deliberately suck in PvE raiding in Classic whether or not they fix the broken specs.
---
I am not intending to deliberately suck, even when playing a meme spec. If a player gets the most out of the kit they're given, that's not sucking. That's also the point you cannot seem to grasp. But more and more I think it's not that you can't grasp it, actually. It's just about keeping this game of ping pong going as long as you can.
---
I don't think someone sucks if their "numbers" aren't as good as another spec. The specs weren't well balanced, so assessing someone's skill must be based on the kit they're given. It's all relative, my friend.
---
&gt; OP asked about how it could be changed to make it better in a specific way. That is the thread topic. What did you expect people to talk about?
---
How to have more fun with meme specs.
---
To be fair they overhauled all talent trees
---
None of these spec trees are worthless. They often provide some early tier talents that help other specs. Other times they're workable for PvP but not PvE. Still other times they are good for farming, leveling, etc. Every spec is useful, not every spec is ideal for raids.
---
I'm not taking a stance on what _I_ think would make Classic more ideal. I'm taking a stance on why it doesn't need to be changed.
---
&gt;im pretty sure it will stay even after the release
---
Well, if you have already decided to just view everything Blizzard says on the matter as a lie, then I don't get why you are even interested in Classic at all. 
---
every spec is viable, no changes necessary
---
&gt; I want no changes  
---
&gt; *only big changes that totally affect gameplay for everyone*
---
they already said that they not gonna change anything
---
I'd guess people would play private servers.
---
This is how the cookie crumbles (the group)
---
I've been playing a private server for a month now, it's a very different feeling than current wow, or even wow 8 years ago. Each class is actually unique, every class brings something to the table that no other class can bring. It's an immersive experience, the world feels so much larger than it does in current wow. You're not the chosen hero that kills a god, you're an adventurer that helps a farmer kill some wolves or bandits.  
---
But yeah picking a class is the hardest choice, since every class feels good in their own way.  
---
Rogue is my choice, and actually feels like a rogue, lockpicking and poisons are skills that you need to level.  
---
Saying "old reckoning" is kinda ridicules since infinite stacking reckoning was in the game for VERY little time before they capped it to 5.
---
There is no Blizzard anymore. Activison took over. Blizzard is just a name.
---
I am extremely skeptical about Classic, but in the same time, I am betting on Activision GREED to deliver Classic WoW as close as possible to Vanilla.
---
Because if they don't, they won't make money off Classic.
---
I agree with that, then again your Raid and Class leaders should know what's going in. 
---
because only some months ago they mentioned sharding and we are not talking about blizzard anymore btw
---
I've been doing the exact same thing haha!
---
Why do you advise against using 4K for programming?
---
Why does every spec has to be viable? It just doesn't make any sense. Just like in the real world, we are not the same.
---
This shit didn't fly on my tiny server, LFD enabled this behaviour.
---
I hope classic will maintain this. I still remember to not invite anyone from &lt;people of honer&gt; and that Fatiih is a shockingly bad Paladin with even worse English.
---
Sadly I am not 100% sure (since Blizz did not explicitly confirm it), but we know the following:
---
-WoW (base game and all expansions except the current one) doesn't require a purchase. Just an active subscription. Purchase only needed for the current expansion.
---
-Classic is included in the WoW subscription.
---
So in conclusion I think this option:
---
&gt;Does that mean that 1) there will be no purchase required (apart from the subscription)
---
is how it's going to be. 
---
Alas no pet tab so storage is at a premium
---
I played Vanilla for 1 1/2 years and I have no memory of ninja looting. 
---
I've seen the majority of people who chime in on this topic over the last year say that it either never happened to them or that it only happened to them once. 
---
This is a case of peoples' imaginations creating a situation that needs to be solved. 
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
I started in TBC and played vanilla on pservers as well. Its so so good
---
its just that cookie typically happens after VC which is by far the hardest encounter in the dungeon
---
so i dont get how that commenter can see cookie as some type of groupbreaker when hes an optional boss to begin with
---
I guess I haven't played longer than I thought. 
---
I hope the recent drop in subs makes them push for an earlier release, the only concern with that would be bugs, but I mean BFA was buggy af. I just want to officially experience original azeroth again.
---
Spending a year or two clubbing and raving is fine.. But after that it becomes very sad
---
My biggest issue with buffing the oomkins, ret pally, and enchance shaman and whatever other spec you want to play thats not viable is the unforseen effect it will cause on some raid encounters and what it does to pvp.  It will lead to a chain of buffs and nerfs until we get to some type of actual balance that will end up in sonething that doesnt even closely resemble what the game was like 12 years ago.
---
When you need on a BoP item that is obviously not for you, the scam is both obvious (so people can choose to stop playing with you) and not very profitable, because all you can do is disenchant or vendor it.
---
When you scam someone with loot sharing, it is both hard to detect for the person being scammed, because you needed on an item that just as well might have been an upgrade for you, and it is very profitable, because you got your friend a real upgrade.
---
Apples and oranges.
---
You're missing the advanced style scam. If you have ironfoe already, you can equip something else and run with a mate who needs it. Both of you roll, even though you already have it, and that gives your mate an increased chance of winning. 
---
The whining about loot trading is one of the stupidest whines I've seen on a video game forum, and man were there some dumb whines in 2018.
---
If anything loot trading will AVOID frustration and accidental ninja'ing. You no longer have a mere 30 seconds to figure out who all is allowed to roll and for what reason. If someone fucks up a roll you can trade it to them. It will significantly reduce loot drama, not increase it.
---
Oh no, three guys from &lt;Maids of Honor&gt; all rolled on Ghostshroud, but only one of them is a dr00d! Guess what? Just.. blacklist that guild or whisper one of their officers or something. Smaller community punishes ninja'ing and if anything it will be even easier to vigilante justice ninjas than before - no more "lol it was an accident"
---
Game is on.
---
See you summer 2019 😎
---
Quick check on the database:
---
Boars go from level 1-11, 14-17, 25-26, 34, 37, 48-50, 52-53
---
The middle is entirely Razorfen downs. Might be a challenge to find enough boars!
---
Devs already admitted that some specs just being THAT BAD for raids was not intended. 
---
Why would you say it's sad? All that music, all those people, all that love...I don't ever want that to end. I've met some amazing people in the rave scene.
---
They won’t last long with reputations to uphold. Or blizzard can fuck it up and do sharding so no reputation is needed and everyone can be a huge dickhead and have zero negative affect for being a dick. 
---
good point :) 
---
Very accurate especially the last one
---
&gt;My girlfriend's boyfriend got me hooked.
---
...wut.
---
This is the only argument that can be said against making specs viable.
---
Balance changes always have huge meta implications. You see this in online games all the time. 
---
Could be healer going afk and forgetting that there's still a boss left with rest of the group soldiering on. Maybe tank was a bit special and fell down to the water, with cookie promptly following and pulling all the skippable trash...
---
We just don't know!
---
I completely agree.  People are going to find a way to be jerks regardless of the rule set.  Since there will be jerks on whichever server/faction I choose no matter what - I prefer the option with no changes so I can experience the same kind of jerks as I did 14 years ago.  Hows that for nostalgia?  But I will still play without batting an eyelash if loot trading is involved.     
---
At least I got chicken
---
People keep cheering about the Classic community being so great. 
---
Yet when it comes to loot trading everyone and their mother is seen as a dick who was just lying in wait for the opportunity to plan their scam and screw over others. 
---
This. Don't confuse the two please.
---
A true tryhard player will try to do their best and try to lift others up with them. An impatient shitter will pull while the tank is clearly waiting for group mana and then complain about the wipe.
---
I tend to go pretty fast in dungeons (usually tank and group leader) but I also adapt our run speed, pulls techniques etc. heavily to the condition and limitations of the group. Have had plenty of people go and pull or try stupid aoe shit in dungeons then complain about death or wipe.  
---
If I tell you to not pull, you don't pull. If I tell you to sheep that axe thrower you will sheep it. If I tell you to focus fire that ghost before it splits you will nuke it as hard as you can. If you fuck up easy instructions like that I'll tell you again and try to teach you. But if you rage about your own mistakes and blame others I'll boot your ass because the run will be more pleasant with 4 even if we can't just replace you within 2 minutes.
---
Of greater concern is an ally passing by and deciding it would be fun to ruin your escort quest hahaha
---
That last one is why I am so excited for Classic. So I can actually rp as a character without being warshipped 
---
I wouldn't say that I'm missing it, I'd say that it'll be rare and I'll probably express my intention to roll on ironfoe upon joining the group.  If it looks like there's a group of friends and one of them wants it too, I'll probably find another group.  
---
Calm down Sylvanas.
---
A regular physical dps melee hunter can easily pull as much dps as a ret pally in early content (because ret pally really doesn't do a lot). 
---
There is a super rare spellpower lifesteal onhit spec (only using items that are confirmed to scale with spellpower, not that private server nonesense from a few years back) that does somewhat competetive dps, but is extremly costly to maintain and really hard to gear, because you need some really expensive items and spellpower gear that people don't like giving to hunters. Also requires you to play on ally for raiding and a pally to maintain mana judgment on the boss if fights extend past 2 minutes. Also, it doesn't scale well after ZG patch, but then again, hunter has shitty scaling anyway.
---
Why wouldn't they just continue to play private servers?
---
When inviting people for levelling dungeons I usually just invite by role. I don't care if there is loot overlap because the levelling dungeons are there for the quests, not for the loot. If someone is concerned about levelling loot I'll usually not take them because they're too likely to cause trouble.
---
Nailed it.
---
Right? Current wow has no freedom. If I wanna play as an undead warlock who is genuinely not so nice a person, I'm forced to be a good guy!
---
Classic just leaves you alone.
---
Loot trading would fill up like 1/3 of my "fuck it I'm out" bar. I understand why it doesn't bother some people but, to me, it indicates a fundamental mindset within the development team that will inevitably lead to further meddling. 
---
I'd see Classic as impermanent like private servers are because, in Classic, I'd be waiting for them to chip away at the game with needless changes until I don't want to log in. That's why I've never played private servers: I'd be waiting for corrupt admins to do something to chip away at - or blow up - the experience until my character becomes useless.
---
In either case, my character is impermanent. The entire point of this was that Blizzard would be in charge and would give us a real experience. Now BNET integration and loot trading are announced and sharding is likely. I can't fucking believe it. 
---
Prolly because the only people who join meme guilds like this are bad players and meme speccers, and you only allow the best memespeccers but allow any shit fury warrior to join.
---
You get a huge boost of exp if you managed to do all 3 so what I do is if I had gotten the other 2 done I will do tanaris last. If not I skip It.
---
The thing I really liked about TBC was that I got to play with all of my friends and we all raided together.  Sure we were far behind the curve but everyone could participate.  We all grouped together, gathered new friends to help and slowly pushed our way through the raid tiers.  You had to finish one tier to start the next in many cases which felt really awesome.  There wasn't some looming next raid that would be released and make all your current progress feel worthless.  We were behind the curve, you would probably call us bad, but we all got to play together and had a great time.  We killed Illidan and got 4 bosses deep into sunwell before WOTLK came out.. still look back on that time fondly.
---
All classes were viable in Vanilla, I hope they wouldn't change that
---
&gt; Now you got a super computer with almost instant load times to play a game with 12 year graphics :D.
---
It's a double edge sword. Now I don't get to read the loading screen gameplay tips. :(
---
IIRC lashers weren't actually supposed to drop loot, maybe you should make sure that these spots are actually viable before leveling a character just to get a bit more gold per hour.
---
The "genius" idea was to make every class the same. 
---
Well that may be the case then! :) But am I a bad tank for not stopping him not dying after he pulls three mobs? At lvl19, what ability other than sunder armour is best to spam when no mobs are attacking me and I can't generate good rage? ((Genuine question))
---
Humans behave well because of some combination of law, social pressure, and internal morals. I don't steal for moral reasons, others don't steal for fear of the camera, and others don't steal because their friend would ask them what the fuck dude.
---
Some % of humans weigh law heaviest in their ethical makeup. If the WoW looting law allows and encourages cheating then they will cheat. Ninja looting via grouping up to funnel loot to friends incentivizes people to ninja loot. If X=20%, 30%, 40%+, then ninja looting becomes the dominant culture of Classic and the social pressure and internal morality people either participate in that new culture or are cheated by it.
---
Guilds aren't going to do anything about ninjaing once it becomes the default culture. 
---
Where are you forced? By killing innocents with plague ? Killing your own soldiers ? Invading farmers ? Burning down sacred trees?
---
And that is why I'm going to be hosting my own emp runs as tank with Ironfoe reserved and loot on ML.
---
Good read, thank you for this.
---
I feel you man, it’s one of the reasons why I was scared to tank as a kid when I played WoW even though I was good at it. Esp. when you’re young it’s hard to argue with a bunch of people older than you and it’s stressfull.
---
Nowadays though I’m always group leader when I tank. So I can kick anyone who doesn’t adhere to my rules.
---
I can pretty much guarantee there's going to be sharding in the starting zones the first few weeks.
---
I’m not sure there’s a fix for it really, it’s the players who are the pricks not the system. The worst abuse I ever seen of this was in wotlk, people rolling for stuff they already had or didn’t need just to then whisper you and offer it for a price, I quit the game over that as it just seemed a giant waste of my time. Don’t get me wrong, I was in pugs and if I had a guild it wouldn’t have happened but you should be able to lug without wanting to uninstall the game due to arseholes. 
---
This kind of posts is why no one takes this community serious 
---
It's not always possible, but yeah noted! 
---
We do know, well I do at least haha. It was because some dps (the group leader I think) accidentally pulled even more trash than there already was. And like I said they all did jack shit for damage.
---
Read the dev AMAs. Massive imbalance was not intended. 
---
And meme specs becoming viable does obviously not mean every class is the same. 
---
Yeah, because someone pulled even more trash than the ~2 mobs already close to Cookie. And because my group barely did any damage we couldn’t kill the trash before wiping. Tank couldn’t hold aggro for shit.
---
You have to be careful though. You can under level zones pretty easily if group to finish quests making eventual solo play really difficult. This is remedied by going to another zone, but yeah.
---
When people roll just to be jerks, they get instantly know as malicious players and their reputation on the server gets tarnished. When you have loot trading you can trade after the fact, hidding from plain sight and noone will be the wiser that a ninja situation just has taken place.
---
tldr: Loot trading is still bad.
---
Because what's the fucking point of having them in the game if you can't play them? Might as well take Prot and Ret from Paladin, Enh and Ele from Shaman and Feral and Balance from Druid. Why allow them at all? 
---
This is a retarded question.
---
Nah they're totally about the drugs dude. Try going to a techno rave and not taking drugs
---
Become tank. Host your own runs. Reserve it. Masterloot.
---
Rinse. Repeat.
---
Classes like warriors run dungeons for the loot alone though...? You seem to be using a retail mindset. I only run each dungeon once but I notice that almost every time most of my groupies have already done all quests in a previous run.
---
It’s not uncommon for warriors and even other classes to run a dungeon ~5 times just to get a BiS upgrade.
---
It does get annoying if you get 2-3 warriors who all need the same loot. They started fighting which only furthered the chance of the group breaking up.
---
I don't know how you guys expect this game to be playable for the first week or two without sharding in the starting zones.  It's a necessary evil at launch.
---
Beyond that, I've seen no indication that Blizzard intends to make sharding a prominent feature of the game, so I don't understand the hand-wringing about it.
---
Identify real-world locations of servers and choose one that is physically close to you. Blizzard sometimes designates "timezones" for servers that _don't_ match where the servers actually are. Ping is what matters, not what the in-game clock says.
---
You might also give some thought to whether you want to play on a server with a major streamer. Arguments can be made that servers that are "youtube popular" might not necessarily be very good to play on.
---
Check this sub come launch. I'm sure there will be a lot of discussion. Painful as it might be to wait...a couple days spent watching things unfold rather than locking yourself in on day one, might pay off six months down the line.
---
Forgot where I was and what century we were talking about. 
---
Oh yes and get all that shady drama, monthly fresh, tech problems and bugs for free too. No way at all I would ever touch this shit again if Blizzard releases at least something close to what most people expect of Vanilla.
---
This is just objectively wrong unless you mean that for certain roles, every class was viable. Hybrid classes were designated as healers or utility. https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs?t=464
---
This is exactly my plan.  I will tank groups and reserve gear prior to the start, and make sure any competing spec understands the terms.  As a scrub in vanilla I was happily a member of a few groups with warrior tanks who reserved gear.  I didn't care as long as I could get some scraps and come along on a decent PUG.   
---
awww, someone's LFR trinket didn't titanforge :-(  
---
maybe cheer yourself up with a cash shop mount! 
---
Why are you going to extremes? Who is saying "Massive imbalance" is fine? Who is saying devs intended it? Today's class balance is a joke, most classes can heal, most classes can res, most classes can lust, etc, etc........ I just don't like that. It is OK if you do. But it is one of the many reasons I want vanilla back. Every class felt special because every class was different.
---
&gt; How
---
Plug it into google.
---
For example: http://et.worldofwarcraft.wikia.com/wiki/US_realm_list_by_datacenter
---
They already did that, so i guess your out......
---
Instead of: Come on guys tell your friends to log in we are short a few for Mythic Ul’Dir. come on guys this is the only time I can raid this week.
---
Say: Ok we’ve got 50 people online who want to raid who are we cutting?
---
How does it feels to use more than two buttons ? Writhing must be feeling like marathon after a raid day 
---
I just had to upvote this :)
---
Hilarious and spot on! :D
---
Theres a questline that starts in Shimmering Flats that sends you back and forth across the world about a dozen times.
---
I can't say I've gone to a "techno" rave, but I've been to plenty trance and house shows and had an awesome time, drugs or no drugs.
---
People still played them. If YOU couldn't, then just don't.
---
I very much enjoyed the last one. Let's go back to basics. No one's a superhero anymore. We are all travellers, searching to do right in the world. 
---
i don't get the reference, it must be a world of warcraft thing
---
I have found on private servers that leveling without skinning is a huge waste, so I strongly recommend that for leveling.
---
It depended on the server.  My server horde outnumbered alliance and pvp queues were long for horde.
---
I don't see how sharding the starter zones, which might be the current plan, nothing confirmed yet though will invade all aspects of the game. Its not something i like though, but i also don't see any better alternatives being coined. 
---
Loot trading will depend on the iteration. If they keep the iteration where if a need roll was done the item becomes soulbound and you can trade only items that were masterlooted or greed rolled i'd probably be fine with it. 
---
As someone playing vanilla for the first time the shoulder one is so relatable.
---
Because vanilla WAS massively imbalanced. The hybrid classes were reduced to pure healers. You know, hybrids that are supposed to be able to fill mutliple roles. 
---
And classes can be all different even if all specs are viable. YOU are the one that's going to extremes by claiming making unviable specs viable makes all classes the same.
---
And I'm not even talking about today's class balance for reference, but ok..
---
Farming a dungeon during levelling is nearly never worth it because you'll just replace it within a few levels. Of course Cookie's wand would probably be nice to have for you but rerunning deadmines a bunch of times, sometimes with bad wipe-ridden groups, simply isn't worth it.
---
Lots of different blessings come into play during a fight.  You can use RF to grab aggro if you have a stupid clothie, BOP as well to make a DPS drop aggro (especially fun on rogues if they pull aggro.. makes them stop DPSing like you can put them into a penalty box). 
---
There are many ways to be useful in group PVE content, and group PVP is of course a whole different animal.  It's not for everyone but I think paladins are one of the most fun classes to play in group.  So many ways to support and impact the fight. 
---
I agree completely with your social commentary on human behavior.  I disagree about dubious looting schemes becoming the "dominant culture of classic."  I don't have much faith in humanity but I think most people who act this way won't be able to muster 2 willing accomplices very often.    "Hey man, I really want ironfoe from BRD.  Will you and Facepwner come with me to do something shitty?"   
---
I didn't advise against using 4K for programming, you people have an odd tendency to make up stuff about what I've "suggested" or "advised". 
---
I was pointing out how ridicolous it is to buy a 4K monitor purely for coding. High resolution should never be the focus when purchasing a monitor for coding. 
---
Warriors are SO MUCH FUN!  However.. they have an extremely hard time leveling.  Pull more than one equal level mob to you and there's a good chance you will die or spend a long time eating afterwards.  It's similar to leveling a rogue except you can't stealth and you have no short CDs to use frequently to help with the occasional accidental pull.  Be prepared with information on where you're going to get your leveling weapons.  There are quests, auction house greens, and duengon loot that can help a lot.   You will be pressured into tanking a lot so be prepared for that, but on the nice side of things people will often whisper you "Hey want to tank Ulda?  Princess run first boss is dead and we can summon".  It's basically a free shot at some loot for a group that lost their tank.  This will happen all the time and it feels nice to be useful.
---
You've described 3 zones post Cataclysm, and the experience of 1/2 of players in BfA. You're "Horde is evil" criticism for BfA is missing about a decade of storytelling, and is missing the point of someone not wanting to be "The Hero of Azeroth."
---
Or wrong...
---
We dont know how dungeon farming will turn out, but there will be ways to farm as a lock, thats for sure. You wont beat a mage and maybe not a hunter but every other class handily and you can farm whatever is high on demand since you can just aoe dot everything. DM and Mara are the most well known dungeons you can farm as others have said already
---
I type with two fingers so joke's on you.
---
The problem with loot trading is that people will ninja items and you wouldn't even know that was a ninja. 
---
Let's take UBRS for example, I'm a rogue and I have 2 other rogues/hunters/warrs with me, I already have both dal'rends or even a felstriker, I can just unequip it at the start and roll need on items that I have just to give it to a friend, while they can also get items for me, and people will never know you did it.
---
Or... the server will say "THAT GUILD group rolls on absolutely everything don't group with them" and everyone will stop grouping with them, just like what happened with every other ninja or every other guild of questionable morals in Classic/TBC. 
---
Plus, say you are in a pre-made of 4, and on the first drop, EVERYONE rolls for the blue staff for the priest. What do you think the 5th player is going to do? He's either going to quit, or he's going to roll need on every other item in the entire instance just for revenge. And while the odds still strongly favor your group taking all the loot, that guy still has the possibility to counterninja your ass.
---
It just is not remotely going to be the problem you think it is.
---
What should I be focusing then if I want a monitor to use for programming?
---
I have terrible eyesight which is why I covet 4K so much.
---
Say: Ok, we've got 50 people online, lets do 25men split runs for Ony for more epix!
---
You are only talking about pve, the implications of changes run far deeper than damage meters.  Should you buff pally threat and mana efficiency but completely remove their ability to heal in raids?
---
Going to be straight forward but when the tank stands near market 2-3 mob pack for about 10-15seconds and just does nothing instead pulling , i get agitated badly. 
---
I did not make that claim but OK. We can agree to disagree.
---
This isn't gonna happen though. People with that mentality will gtfo of classic before reaching lvl15.
---
The gameplay is significantly slower than Retail, so a lot won't even make it to lvl10.
---
There will be no faceroll groups, so this behaviour will quickly filter out people who won't enjoy the classic experience. They'll just get bored and quit.
---
How often do you get called that ? Ah yeah ONCE.
---
And you said you want to play a evil undead. 
---
But you can be evil as alliance too if you look at the quests. 
---
But I know it’s easier to hate and make stuff up or.?
---
Can't wait for triggered BfA players talking about how this is not true at all.
---
Depends from which perspective you look at it from. 
---
Sad that everythig except M+ x and mythic raiding is pisseasy in retail.
---
Say with me: Raiding isnt the only endgame in vanilla.
---
This is why I’m excited for classic, retail has no community interaction except shitty jokes in general or trade. Going through dungeons is a chore especially since people never talk anymore 
---
You've got the answer to the problem right here.  Run your own groups, and master loot.  Understand that if you're going along with someone else's group, you're not in control and shenanigans may ensue.  
---
You've got a mad inferiority complex if you're coming here to gloat about BfA class design
---
Stop being a stooge and just play your game
---
Once? We're called "Champion" as pronoun on a regular basis, ever since WotLK. 
---
Exactly. As long as the melee DPS and the healer are ready for the next group, I'm gonna pull if I dont need CCs. Mage can drink to full and get into the fight halfway in. 
---
So you mean like all of classic ? Like the raids are on lfr level. But you will say my expirience doesn’t count because private server numbers are wrong. And Arena rbg is easy ? Mage tower was easy ? Pet battle dungeons are easy? 
---
And were is this magic end game of vanilla out site of raiding. You made no example yet 
---
&gt; \*Literally nothing the whole dungeon\*
---
Man that's so on point. Dungeons used to be fun, now they're just an awkward chore.
---
The tank probably did not want anyone rolling on Cruel Barb, Smites hammer and the leather jerkin that good enough for mail classes because of its stats. Thats why he only invited clothis.
---
spell batching
---
Getting my first shoulders and bandana is my most fond memory from World of Warcraft, I can't wait.
---
As we know, people will always come and go for plenty of reasons.  As a guild’s core group advances, departed members need to be replaced by new members at the current stage of progression.  Continuing to allow fresh 60’s to raid in the main raid group will result in becoming a “stepping stone” guild that only does the earliest content, and every decent player leaves for a better, more cohesive guild.  
---
wrong its not "we'll need to cc that mob on the right" its "sheep moon"
---
The real problem with this scenario is puggable raid content, and "wild-west" style PUG leadership.  I did a couple PUG TOC runs in WOTL, and the guy running it had everyone /roll for the drops 1 at a time.  When I joined that group, it's what I was signing up for.  
---
Commented under a post taking shots at retail. Gj 
---
Instead of: hearthstone ready every 5 minutes 
---
Say: aw man, I have to run from thousand needle to orgrimmar 
---
&gt; Like the raids are on lfr level.
---
Lol wut? Remember what happened at the 10 year anniversary raid?
---
&gt; raids are on lfr level
---
Seems like you never passed MC 
---
&gt;rbg
---
Competitive pvp isn't easy in classic
---
&gt; Pet battle dungeons
---
Ahhpfffffffff
---
Get a grip or better just stick to BFA and collect some mounts
---
Odd I can’t seem to find were outsite of magni and khadgar. Can you show me ?
---
Just make a habit out of it to NEVER join "LFMs tank".
---
From my anecdotal experience a good 25-40% of runs start to hiccup somewhere inbetween when I didnt make the group.
---
If I set the group up myself, they are a success from start to finish in 97%.
---
From loot rules (I always set the rule that everybody rolls need on everything outside of BoPs to prevent ninjas) to dumb people etc. 
---
I only ever join LFMs when they need a tank for the endboss like "LFM Wyrmthalak/UBRS drakki/baron, everything is dead except boss".
---
I understand how the scam works.  I'm saying it won't be common, and you can make sure you don't end up in this situation by running your own groups.
---
You mean people get dced and kicked out ? Dispell having high cooldowns ? And still people did not wipe once ? Yes I remember. 
---
And dispell having high cooldowns is important here 
---
The thing is though, for ninjaing like that to work, the item has to clearly be an upgrade for the person who won it. Yes it might be a paladin rolling on Briarwood Reed for healing, and then passing it to his mage friend, but that Paladin was entitled to roll on it anyway. 
---
I don't disagree that loot trading will happen, but the circumstances to engineer it are going to be rarer than people think, and there WILL be blacklisting. 
---
Personally I'm fine with it because if you're someone specifically going after a certain piece of loot then you'll likely discuss it with the team before you go. A wise party is one that knows who'll roll on everything before it even drops.
---
The convenience though of being able to instantly resolve mistakes is far better than classic. People seem to be forgetting the reason they're doing loot trading - its so you DONT have to petition 
---
"oh sorry i hit need by accident" -&gt; you'd have to raise a ticket, and might not get the item given anyway. The person might get a rep as a ninja too.
---
"oh sorry i hit need by accident" -&gt; "but nevermind, here you go, here's the item"    Instant resolution. 
---
If nothing else it will make sure that people make friends and group with people they trust. You want that Briarwood Reed? Make enough friends that you can get a full team of them to help you, or be open and honest when recruiting to the team that it's why you're going.
---
Yes if blizzard actually balanced classes properly I would consider playing a hybrid again.  If they don't I'll be playing a pure class.
---
Making your own UBRS can be hard because farming the key isn't that easy. You'll end up in a pug most of the time.
---
Yep assholery doesn't care about loot rules.
---
Yes, dispell having a high cooldown is the important part in a world where everyone can dispell and mass dispel exists, and not wiping once? lmao people spent 12 hours in there without being able to finish.
---
It's the only expansion I decided not to buy. Not completely Blizz's fault- the game is so different from what made me fall in love with it back in vanilla.
---
I think you might be on the wrong sub. I like BFA, but if you hated Legion, you'll probably hate BFA even more, so I'd stay away.
---
Do you have thunderclap at this level? I thought sunder armor does not really generate threat like in the old days.
---
So you havent played it?
---
LF1M Healer = LF 1 Druid/Priest/Pally/Shaman
---
LF1M DPS = LF 1 Mage/Rogue/Hunter/Warlock
---
LF1M Tank = LF 1 Warrior
---
I feel you. Tanking is just sooo much more than just marking mobs and pulling them.
---
You often become a social worker mediating between conflicting parties, keeping the group intact, soothing heated conversations etc.
---
Def get a weapon chain. After that crusader is good if you pay attention to the proc and use other cds with it but agi will be more consistent 
---
Totally. There is a point where they need to change how they operate though if they ever hope to progress though. The guild I was in just had bad leadership. The one I joined afterwards was one of the better guilds and distributed loot much more fairly and didnt require people to sacrifice DKP if they didnt want to. You were expected to manage your own bids for loot and holding out could cost you your raid spot. Of course though 40 man raids rarely had the problem of too many people trying to join, it was usually the other way around lol.
---
&gt;and there WILL be blacklisting
---
How do you blacklist someone rolling on gear they "need"?
---
what's the leverage?
---
You get about  what? 2 rage per hit when tanking at level 19?
---
Rage generation isnt normalized, so 60damage at lvl 19 get you the same rage as 60dmg at lvl 60. 
---
Doing 20damage with your crappy 1hander gives you the same rage as 20damage at level 60.
---
Rage generation is abysmal at lowlevels. 
---
fucking loved my gray brocade shoulders 
---
They don't report numbers to public and their internal reports surely will contain distribution between classic and retail play time, so they won't fool anyone.
---
We use the term "morally grey" around here.
---
There arent any. Hes talking out of his ass, probably never tanked before. 
---
You and I know that you can be happy to apply sunder every 3seconds with 2mobs hitting you, because rage gen is so bad at lowlevels.
---
What does that have to do with anything and how do you get to the conclusion I would support something like this?
---
First of all I clarified I am against balance changes because of the meta implications. Secondly even if I were hypothetically open to the idea, what would that change you talk of achieve? Making paladin a viable tank but then an unviable healer? Then we have the same hybrid balancing problem, just it's reduced to pure tank instead of pure healer in case of paladin.
---
What are you doing? 
---
they didn't invest anything in classic and so they aren't asking much in return(included in subscription).
---
classic will be just milking the cow till it's dead
---
Ah right yeah maybe thunderclap would have done a better job. I think it generates less threat to 1 mob, but it would have been spread across the three. Yeah maybe it would have worked, but I think the failure of the party was not due to my bad tanking :/
---
&gt; If anything loot trading will AVOID frustration and accidental ninja'ing 
---
First, there is no accidental ninjaing. It's like saying that some guy robbed a store by accident. We are in 2019, right? people KNOW so much more about gaming...right? So...if they know so much, how could they click need on an item that is clearly NOT for them?
---
However, some people might actually accidentally click need. But clearly those accidental need click will be extremely, EXTREMELY rare. In fact, they will be so rare, that implementing loot trading is absolutely illogic. To avoid one in 1,000 cases of miss clicking, they are implementing a system that ENCOURAGES ninja looting, under the guise of miss clicking.
---
Furthermore, there is nothing that forces anyone to actually trade the item they allegedly miss clicked need on. The system ALLOWS players to trade the item...not forcing them.
---
&gt; Oh no, three guys from &lt;Maids of Honor&gt; all rolled on Ghostshroud, but only one of them is a dr00d! Guess what? Just.. blacklist that guild or whisper one of their officers or something 
---
Blacklist that guild? Really? How about NOT having loot trading, and blacklisting A SINGLE player once in a blue moon, instead blacklisting 3 guys every single day or entire guilds? If the blacklist would be endless...it might work. But with 50 spots only, pretty much everyone will have their blacklist FULL in couple weeks.
---
I would understand a loot trading system that works EXCLUSIVELY on raids and ONLY with master looter on, so a miss click from the master looter can be fixed. But loot trade for every circumstance? That is stupid, and it will create a bigger problem in order to solve a very small problem.
---
Nobody quits Classic because of a ninjaed item, that might happen once in a blue moon. But many people will quit Classic because loot trading will obviously create a meta that have no place in Classic : making ninja looting official.
---
&gt;  no more "lol it was an accident 
---
Nope, it will be replaced by : "So, wanna pay X gold for this item?". Ninja looters were NEVER punished by ToS. And never will be, because every played have to have all options available (need, greed, pass) and equal to other players.
---
Only the community can actually punish ninja looting players. However, with a limited 50 slots for ignore list, a player will be able to avoid grouping with ONLY 50 ninja looters...and with loot trading in place, there will be FAR MORE ninja looters than 50...so a player will have to do what?
---
Keep a text file with player names? That is unrealistic, and a lot of players will quit Classic before even thinking of making an additional blacklist.
---
This is not about AVOIDING ninja looting. Ninja looting is UNAVOIDABLE. This is about NOT ENCOURAGING ninja looting, which it will be encouraged if the loot trade system is implemented outside raid master looting.
---
Hes a tricky boss because 99% of groups jump down to him. Have a lvl 17 healer priest in the group and its a sure fire way to pull the patrol. If the patrol is between them and the next group, you have high chances you will chain aggro not only the patrol, but also the group next to them.
---
Have fun fighting the boss and 4 elites.
---
Similar story here. I started playing late TBC and I saw those vanilla mechanics, changed but still similar. I loved them and it was sad to see them go. Gonna enjoy them in more pure form. I played private servers and I loved it, the only reason I'm not playing now because I just don't want to spoil things for myself, I really want to repeat the discovery and learning process, so I just hope that there won't be a lot of those stupid minimaxers forcing everyone around to cut their fun.
---
Jaina used to say it quite a lot
---
Going back to P-Server and Activision aint getting the Money?
---
It will be rare? More rare than ninja looting without loot trading?
---
No, it will be FAR FAR more often with loot trading in place.
---
It will say your character name in text chat, they call you champion in lieu of your name.
---
Yeah but a lot of people here can't see past the massive hard-on they have for vanilla to realize that, in fact:
---
&gt;vanilla WAS massively imbalanced. The hybrid classes were reduced to pure healers. You know, hybrids that are supposed to be able to fill multiple roles.
---
If you don't agree with the hivemind here, you will be downvoted into oblivion. Watch this comment, I promise you it will be downvoted.
---
Look at it this way, when the game launched it didn't have loading screen tips, so it's just a more authentic experience =P
---
He's apparently trying to show us how cool it is to play current wow.
---
Even in your opening comment you imply making all specs viable is somehow the opposite of "not being the same". 
---
And after that, when I pointed out vanilla's massive balance problems, you only reacted by saying every class is the same, as if that were the only alternative to vanilla imbalance.
---
Well that’s on you. But no not everyone can dispell curses 
---
So he's saying it's  ok for  blizzard to do things like sharding because they need to save money?
---
We have maybe 4 quests with her. That doesn’t really sounds like an issue
---
Mind control diamond, sap star..
---
I played a Paladin in vanilla, that's WHY I know what happened to them and I remember being told I had to be in holy spec wearing cloth and mail and not even wearing Plate armor, which I paid 40g to be able to do, thank you very much.
---
Who said anything about this being easy?  Making your own group for basically anything is hard.  Is it worth the hardship not to get cheated out of loot?  If No, then don't complain if it happens.  If yes, congratulations for stepping up - enjoy your loot if it drops and you win it fair and square.  
---
Mikethython
---
Greetings Traveler LMAO.. 
---
But I earned Champion god damnit.
---
Druid's can tank most content in vanilla
---
its been a while i couldnt remember the rest. nuke skulls then X second 
---
Thanks for the statistics.  Wow... double "FAR"?  That sounds pretty serious.
---
Nah there’s a video from 2007 (TBC, but still) of a frost Mage doing the farm.
---
But even if DM:E isn’t broken gold farming in Classic for some reason, I really enjoy playing Mage and there are plenty of other grind spots.
---
I may also level a hunter for gold farming instead
---
Then what is the point of your post?
---
And no curse in MC mattered enough to dispell if the difficulty truly was LFR level.
---
That's so right haha.
---
Don't really think this post belongs on this sub since it really has.. nothing at all to do with Classic, but I'll chime in anyways.
---
If you didn't like Legion, you won't like BFA. BFA took the good parts of Legion and took the dressing off, so now its just a bare, obvious loot casino game. BFA's content in itself is exceptionally underwhelming.
---
I had some fun in it playing arena, levelling alts, and running old raids, but I did almost none of the content new to BFA, and unsubbed in December when they "released patch 8.1" but timegated 80% of the patch content behind an arbitrary "season" release date in mid-January.
---
I enjoyed it for a month or two, but the content is clearly going to be exceptionally sparse for this xpac and dripfed to us as slowly as possible, so I gave up and won't re-sub until classic.
---
TBC lingo IIRC
---
I always felt better about another player in my guild getting gear when they were going to be raiding with me for a long time.  In my good guilds, guild mates getting drops was good for me. In those stepping stone, mass invite guilds, it was gear that was wasted.  
---
The leveling is fun, and the zones are *really* cool.  The best zone design since Pandaria imo.  I can't speak for the raids or this patch, but my problem for it was the end game non-raid progression was very boring.  Island expeditions were interesting at first but they became boring fast and the rewards were garbage.  The world quests were all basically rehashes from last expansion and were just do these 4 easy tasks to get a piece of gear.
---
So if you want to level up your alts you won't be bored, but the game overall doesn't feel like a step forward like legion was, more like a step back. 
---
I've played Wow since it came out, but not the new content. However, my interest in Wow has been waning since Draenor. 
---
Yeah, FD and IB were incredibly annoying to go up against.
---
Sheep moon, sap X, Banish triangle, ice square, and shackle star!
---
Is that all right? Haha.
---
TRAP BLUE TRAP BLUE
---
You mean square?
---
YE TRAP BLUE
---
You're a super hero WHEN YOU EARN IT!
---
Look sharding post #231
---
Lifesteal MH / Agil OH is what both ming and happyminti used
---
The display size has no bearing on how hard it is for your hardware to drive.  
---
Why do you say starting zones when Blizzard never said starting zones?
---
&gt;They know that sharding will be detrimental in zones other than Elwynn and Durotar.
---
Then why did they say early zones which include zones past what you just said? 
---
It seems you don't even know Blizzards stance yet you defend them.
---
People will also be jerks and ninjas WITH loot trading, so what is your point?
---
I play BFA, pretty much nonstop since it launched, and still having fun. Don't listen to all the "cool kids"  who  jumped on Blizzard hate wagon because some streamer told them to, or because they've been reading too much /r/wow and can't think for themselves. Decide for yourself.
---
It's early zones not starting zones.
---
If you hated legion, you'll hate BfA. I didn't stop doing world quests in Legion because I was bored of the individual quests, but rather the world quest system as a whole. BfA has the exact same system, but instead of killing 10 naga and destroying 5 crates, you kill 10 pirates and destroy 5 barrels. It's pretty much a copy paste expansion. 
---
Who hurt you?   Seriously, tell us your story(ies).  
---
Tryhards? They're not trying very hard if they give up that easily.
---
I'm on an RP server, so I think I can do all this easily.
---
I resubbed a while back to see how shitty the game was.
---
End game PvE is pretty much an abysmal failure unless you like islands and mythic+.
---
PvP is ok
---
I’m leveling my original class on my original server for nostalgia (if you can call it that with the state of the game), and the leveling is a bit of a shame. You get maybe 1/4 through a zone before going to the next expansion’s content; pretty immersion-breaking imo
---
Draenor suffers from pretty substantial tuning issues (several quest NPC non elites are chunking me for 10%+ max hp, one did this several times per second)
---
Legion was bad to me, BFA is a worse Legion 
---
My examples:
---
\- twinking (getting fishing hat, Feldwood medic pouch as lvl 19 etc. etc.)
---
\- wPvPing for months on end for PvP videos
---
\- world dragon 400 v 400 PvP
---
\- t0,5 questline. Costs about 500-800g and a weeks of running 5men dungeons and quests outside
---
\- ranking (even this is a bit hardcore in the time compartment for most)
---
Or, if you are worshiped, you're worshiped by the community for being fricken amazing, instead of by NPCs for having a pulse.
---
Are they not fun to do? Can I do them as Undead?
---
We had a Warlock in my guild who we got to Phase 2 on Netherspite before he admitted he was color blind.
---
I'm torn on this.
---
I want as few changes as possible, but some stuff in Vanilla is just poor game design.  Having most people of Feral Druid's finishing moves *not* scale with attack poor was a poor decision that made them completely useless max level.  Stuff like buffing Lacerate for survival hunters so their end-tree talent would do more damage than a Warrior's Rend wouldn't be bad changes imo. 
---
I'm guessing you never played MoP. She was an important character during ToT
---
When I tanked, it was "start on skull.  If we're on skull, X is next.  If we're on X, skull is next."
---
you rekted yourself so hard, even swifty banned you from his chat
---
Kinda dumb question, but does a weapon chain on either weapon prevent disarming entirely?  I thought disarming just removed the MH weapon?  Or does it "technically" remove both weapons?  And a chain on either weapon will prevent that?
---
&gt; Highlord Tirion Fordring yells: My congratulations, champions. Through trials both planned and unexpected, you have triumphed.
---
Highlord Tirion Fordring yells: Go now and rest; you've earned it.
---
_
---
&gt; Highlord Tirion Fordring yells: Welcome, champions! You have heard the call of the Argent Crusade and you boldly answered! It is here, in the Crusaders' Coliseum, that you will face your greatest challenges. Those of you who survive the rigors of the coliseum will join the Argent Crusade on its march to Icecrown Citadel.
---
&gt; Nozdormu yells: Hurry, heroes. In mere moments Deathwing's Cataclysm will complete what he begun and end the world. Join me in the attack, now!
---
&gt; Wrathion says: How do we bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict? I believe the answer lies with heroes like you.
---
The banner fades as Wrathion takes his seat.
---
Wrathion says: We must ensure that you are up to the task... and then equip you accordingly.
---
^ This one kicks off an entire prolonged questline based on the idea that you are Wrathion's singular champion. Similarly the Isle of Thunder is a solo scenario in a way to make it seem like you are the singular hero that helped the Horde/Alliance NPC heroes (Veleera/Whoever the Horde one was) set up the foothold. 
---
Not to mention the entire Expansion based on the idea that we would leave our factions (Alliance/Horde) behind, form our own class orders as the leader, and take up several artifacts of power on par with several legendary items of the past. Like imagine if you just got Atiesh, Thunderfury, Benediction, and Corrupted Ashbringer as an introductory part of the game? 
---
most of us are doing it now and i dont see actiblizz going out of business.
---
&gt;What we know for sure is this: sharding will be limited to the first few weeks, and only for starter areas.
---
You don't even know what you're talking about. They said early zones. Why is it that everyone that defends Blizzard doesn't even know what they said? Or are you lying to just prove a point? This si the third person just in this post pushing the idea that Blizzard said starting zones and not early zones.
---
My go-to farm for warlock back in vanilla was actually DM:W for libram of focus drops. The trash mobs there in vanilla were fearable and also infinitely kitable by exploiting terrain. I could even kill the first boss on my warlock, although it took a lot of patience.
---
On the pserver where I play now unfortunately they made a bunch of modifications to DM:W to keep warlocks from farming it. They added pats and made everything fear immune.
---
Be aware though that your optimal farming spec is SM/DS, which while okay for dungeons is not a raiding spec. Some classes have the ability to farm efficiently in a pure raid spec even without raid gear. For example, priests with holy nova can farm DM:E lashers pretty easily; all they need is enough int to cast enough novas.
---
I leveled my Paladin to 112 and realized I didn’t enjoy wow anymore. Aside from gameplay, the story is horrendous. Aside from the art team, everyone at Blizzard made this expansion blindfolded.
---
Well your job as a tank is trying to keep aggro and keep it even if your mates are dumb and don't listen to what you say, it's not easy task but letting dying someone on purpose is never the good choice, but hey it's my opinion.
---
For your question about threat generation on multiple target, Battle Shout is the answer, it generates 55 threat per party member buffed divided by the number of mobs in combat so waaaaaaay more efficient than spamming sunder armor even in a combat versus only one mob. Once you're fighting more than 7 mobs, you're better using Demoralizing Shout since it generates a static 43 threat not divided by the number of mobs in combat like Battle Shout (which is limited to 275 threat due to the party limit being 5 players). On Pservers (LH, ND, K,...) this works for every appliance of the buff so you can spam it, on classic it will probably only work on the first appliance of the buff (if party members are already buffed it won't generate threat) but with 2 min duration this is still a good trick to use at the beginning of each fight and in the middle if it lasts more than 2 min.
---
If you have question about tanking, feel free to ask, contrary to those disliking my comment, I have experience in vanilla tanking ;)
---
&gt;All they have said is that they intend to use it initially to deal with the starting zone rush.
---
No they didn't. They said early zones. How about you actually go and read again what they said.
---
I miss the days of the tank or healer being a dick and not being able to do anything about it because if you kicked him he'd camp inside the dungeon not letting the 5th player in after you already spent 45 minutes trying to find a replacement.
---
:( Those were the days my friend.
---
BFA is legion but they took out all the good parts (or at least made them worse)
---
You're bad and you should feel bad for spreading bad information
---
Go to town and spam trade about their activities.  Make a macro about it and mash it once every time you log on.  "Facepwner of &lt;Maids of Honor&gt; (rogue) ninja'd loot in BRD, then said "lulz itz mine now".  Don't group with him."  That guy will have a reputation soon and his guild will probably disown him (or get branded as ninjas too).  It may sound fanciful, but it happens.   
---
I've also seen it where the GM will tell you that it has been addressed internally, and to please stop mentioning it in trade.  There can be actual consequences, you just have to make them.
---
And shamans can tank until 45 perfectly fine.
---
That doesn't really mean people wanted them...
---
They said early zones not starting zones. They also said they might use it for events.
---
If you have a constructive suggestion about what we can do to prevent it then post that. Otherwise whining about its potential happening is pointless. 
---
I was a shady ninja once.  I took a break from the game after BWL to focus on university.  Logged back in after a long while and joined a group to help out a BRD run needing a tank.  Something easy to get back into the swing of things.
---
We're quickly moving through the place as I was a T2 geared tank.  We kill the first boss, Golem Lord Argelmach, and Naglering drops.  The stats on the ring were changed since I originally ran the instance so it looks like a pretty neat tank ring to have.  I say so in party chat and roll need.
---
Apparently the unspoken rules regarding loot changed since I originally leveled my character and was pugging groups.  People on the server collectively decided to refuse to use the group loot roll system.  Instead, each time a boss was killed, everyone should pass and then discuss who should get the loot.  Then once an agreement has been reached, that person may loot the item.
---
Such a system seems bonkers to me.  A discussion after every boss kill?  That would add a lot of unnecessary time to the clear.  And it would leave the group incredibly vulnerable to a greedy player who could ninja the item off the corpse.  Why not use the system in place.  Need for main spec, greed for offspec, pass otherwise.
---
However, there I was, as a raid tank with realm first accolades to my name, I was berated by my peers and kicked from the group.  My apologies were not accepted as I was a dirty loot ninja.
---
In my experience, RP is best done with imagination, text, and Dice. Classic has all of those
---
Everything here is true, and I want to add specifically that warlocks are not very good at DM:E lasher farm compared to mages, priests, and paladins. There are several reasons, but IME it mostly comes down to the frequency with which you need to sacrifice VW vs the opportunities you get to recover shards and wonky spec you prefer to have there to make it more safe (AOE damage + stun proc).
---
It’s funny you mention this as I NEVER remember my guild doing split Onyxia runs. I’m not saying it never happened, but when you get into BWL and the gear is quite a bit better tha Onyxia, I think people started seeing it as just an easy source of t2 heads as well as funds. People would intentionally sit out and we would bring players in to get their Quel Serrar or Onyxia heads or what have you.
---
Maybe someone can share their experiences but I think split Onyxia runs are far more prevalent on PS’ than they were in Vanilla.
---
Alternatively, have you tried not sleeping?
---
That leather chest reward tho 
---
Im embarrassed that it took me as long as it did &gt;_&lt;;
---
&gt;I don't see how sharding the starter zones, which might be the current plan, nothing confirmed yet as they are still looking at alternatives, will invade all aspects of the game.
---
Are you alll Blizzard shills? Blizzard **clearly** said early zones and not starting zones. You don't even know Blizzards stance yet are trying to say it won't invade other aspects even though it has already gone beyond what you think it has. They even said they might use it for events.
---
You're half-way there.  People are jerks with our without loot trading.  No matter which loot rules are put into place in Classic, some people will still be jerks and find a way to take things that you want.
---
But the post is about all classes being viable in vanilla... they are.
---
Now really tell me as I'm also genuinely curious. 
---
The outside parameters were as follows:
---
1. Rogue pulls group of 3
---
2. Warrior cant charge because group is too close to another one like on the boat where its quite backed
---
3. Warrior bloodrages and gets his first sunder/ shield bash off
---
4. He taunts the 2nd and now has to wait for sunders while the rogue full on tunnels into the first mob
---
5. Warrior will now have to wait 10 seconds to taunt the 3rd mob off while the rogues hit repeatedly by the elite
---
6. Priest is likely in white/some green gear and does not have much mana
---
7. Priest runs off, group dies. 
---
So could the tank have done better?
---
My first shoulders felt more special as I made them myself on an anvil. I couldn't find replacement for those babies for sucha a long, long time
---
On the alliance side, theres a quest in the loch that makes you go gather 3 machine parts for a gnome. 
---
Do not do this quest if there is competition.
---
Sheep moon, Sap circle and stun lock X
---
If you want to be a tank, you're going to need 90% attendance. If you want to be in a good guild, you're going to be devoting 4 hours, 3 nights a week once AQ40 is out.
---
You might get a spot in a good guild as a bench player but don't expect to get much raid time or loot
---
I did not like the outer space and green and purple glowing everything vibe of TBC.  
---
Out of all the potential races in the WoW universe, yes fokking spacegoats and another, far more annoying version of elves. 
---
I loved Kara, though. It felt like vanilla content.  Except for the Spacegoat-demon boss at the end.    I was like... “tsk...really?”
---
1.  Rogue pulls group of 3 
---
2.  Warrior cant charge because group is too close to another one like on the boat where its quite backed 
---
3.  Warrior bloodrages and ~~gets his first sunder/ shield bash off~~  Use Battle  Shout
---
End of the story. Read my comment below.
---
That’s how I remember it.  God I cannot wait!!!
---
As much as I want some TBClike class changes I am worried they (activision blizzard) will fuck it up since they don’t know how to properly make games anymore. I would love to see Dreamstate and Unrelenting Storms in classic.
---
Maybe better mana regen for Ret and prot paladins. Equalized treat generation and defense stat for druids and paladins to warriors and taunt for paladins.
---
BUT since they are things I want and other people want other things it is unrealistically to ask these things. So I’ll take the base game.
---
What ? You never have to pay 40g to use plate armor.
---
I played and quit on launch day for BFA, reached level 112 on my Paladin and realized I wasn't enjoying myself at all. They stripped any progression/gameplay design they made in Legion, essentially making you feel weaker at level 120. Aside from gameplay, the story is horrendous and imo the last saving grace retail wow had. 
---
More like LF1M Tank = *Oh please dear god, we've been looking for 30 minutes and will take a Hunter /w tank pet at this point.*
---
It's a combination of things. Small number of needed quest items on slowish respawn, all guarded by packs of 2 or 3, deep underwater. Another problem quest is to loot 4 items across two ships that are packed with mobs. 
---
Another one has you kill two 40 water elementals at once and some classes get caught very off guard because they resist so much and hit hard and immune to bleed (mages and warriors especially suck here).
---
The last quest is fighting 3-4 waves of 3 mobs each. It's basically impossible to solo because the mobs despawn very quickly so you have to fight them as they come, leading to fighting 6+ mobs at once. 
---
It's fun in that it's different than most wiest hubs, but the quest are above average difficulty and pure masochism if you can't breathe underwater. 
---
This isn't normal looting practice, certainly not anymore where nary a word in spoken in a group.  I could see it in a guild group who is gearing up, or among friends.  It's their fault for not telling you about their weird process.
---
Or dont listen to somebody on reddit trying to promote garbage when pretty much the whole world telling u not to play it cause its trash and its clear than activision is just trying to milk your wallet with minimal effort.
---
Angry and dumb are a poor combination.  I said I dont have an issue with sharding in the starting zones.  Blizzard has made vague statements about early zones.  We don't know what they classify as early, yet.  
---
I did it like the following:
---
Skull = first kill
---
X = second target
---
Moon = sheep
---
Purple diamond = sap
---
Blue square = frost trap
---
Yellow star = shackle
---
Come to think of it I never did get too many markers to banish.  Maybe because damage didn’t interrupt it or something I don’t know?  And I was a lock main. I guess it would be a whatever was left over thing.
---
Don't you feel like you're missing out? I can't go to a rave or party where I know everyone else is on E and not feel like I'm missing out.
---
I mean, you know how good a time you COULD be having...but you're not.
---
And then the priest starts healing the mobs barrel roll straight  to the healer. Have you ever tanked?
---
T2 gloves, Crusader MH, 15 AGI OH or +5 DMG MH dagger, 15 AGI OH
---
Early is more then starter. It's that simple.
---
Three factors:  You want that gen socket to proc also.
---
&gt;Should you buff pally threat and mana efficiency but completely remove their ability to heal in raids?
---
I don't know what you are trying to say.  I think all of the healing specs are fine, but specs like Feral Druid and stuff were straight up terrible. 
---
Yeah once the warrior is in melee range, that hunter that isnt creating distance is going to melt. 
---
This post was removed because it seems to be entirely about modern WoW (Rule #1). Sorry for the inconvenience, but please try r/wow for purely-BFA discussion.
---
Do not use thr term "retail scrub". Instead, use the PC term of "New Azerothian"
---
All classes are viable in Classic.
---
I can't fucking wait to get my level 16 tauren warrior some cloth shoulders.
---
I will endulge your entirely theoretical comment. If this is about pve we have to look at classes that I would view as "unviable" I will not speak on optimal, just viable. 
---
The goal is to make the most minimal possible impact on the meta. 
---
Paladin tank - give them a taunt and increase holy threat from righteous fury by 20%. (The idea is to allow them wiggle room for more def gear)
---
Ret - this piggy backs onto prot paladins but a small attack power coefficient on concecrate would be good. By small I mean 1.5% at most. 
---
Enh. Shaman, the struggle is the RNG nature of the class. They need to many different things to minimize game changing impact I would remove the debuff effect from stormstrike and have it give a buff that increase shock spell damage to the player instead.
---
Elemental - despite what most may think elemental is a very good spec on any fight shorter than 3mins. With proper gearing prioritizing max Mana pool it can chain lighting on CD for fights shorter than 1.5mins and with minimal down ranking can be net positive for Mana. (No changes needed)
---
Boomkin - this is the biggest hurdle, with the most game changing implications. Starfire is just bad. It has low damage, slow cast time, and very Mana expensive. Also a major problem is the talent nature's grace. The way it works in reality with spell travel time is the boomkin needs 2 consecutive crits to benefit from the reduced cast time. 
---
Spriest - a small buff to mindflay base damage or it's spell coeffecient would be good. Although probably not needed.
---
Let us know what game you end up playing instead.
---
Yeah i will play if classic is classic and stay classic. The only thing that i would like them to change is the balance of classes, and make the unplayable one actually playable. I don't want every god damn tank to be warrior, but that again is only my opinion, and i'll play even if they don't balance anything. But if they add sharding, loot trading, lfg or shit like that, it's an instant byebye
---
&gt; i am actually able to do 40vs40 world pvp and not being phased into another shard while fighting lmao
---
that... that's not how sharding works.
---
Yth said early. Other, higher people, have said it's an option they're looking at for starting zones, at launch. Why cherry pick one and ignore the other?
---
You are dumb. Read my post again.
---
Yes, that is why I prefer the transparent system without loot trading. Atleast the I know when I get fucked in the arse.
---
Then you realize there is a flight point. Then you realize you’re broke so you’re still running.
---
Totally agree...
---
It’s much more “try-hard” to stick through messy groups and get it done than to bail at the first sign of adversity
---
Come to think about it lately, and I have no problem with "Champion", since it only implies that you are somewhat of a better sellsword.
---
However, this is heavily context reliant. When you are told that you are a great friend to the family and you can interrupt their grief with your purpose, you clearly want to be called by name.
---
On the flipside, khadgar called everyone "Hero", which implies, that you do heroic deeds. This really makes me uneasy, since it is much more of a stretch, than being a trusted envoy that can handle combat and is loyal to a certain degree.
---
&gt; This is the third person just in this post pushing the idea that Blizzard said starting zones and not early zones.
---
because aside from this Yth comment, literally every other person has said its for starting zones.
---
The bizarre part is that the new Naglering was clearly a tank ring; stats were stamina and defense.  No one actually wanted it when I apologized and asked.  They were strictly offended because I broke the social code.
---
&gt;From over 20 years of gaming, my experience is that it is more satisfactory to fail some times, figure things out and overcome it all, than to get it all 100% right the first time and move on.
---
This rings true with life in general. 
---
No, its not that simple.  Early can mean a lot of things.  Stop whining.  
---
Way out of the loop here. Is blizzard releasing a vanilla remaster or something? What is classic?
---
Because it is obvious they are looking at more then the starter zones and have said so. They even talked about using it for events.
---
Feral Druid is not terrible at all. Pvp they are one of the easiest to rank. Open world they can solo elites that many classes can’t. They can escape any pvp encounter they choose. In pve they are great group tanks and can even rank encounters in naxx. 
---
I have been playing vanilla on private realms for close to s decade and played all classes at level cap. There is zero issue with druids unless you decide you want to be a pure dps and even then it’s been proven they can match pure dps classes. 
---
Druid is jack of all trades so hardly In Need of ANY buff. Sure a dps pure class may do 5% more damage over a raid but they can’t OT or heal or switch mid fight
---
Sounds to me like you pretty inexperienced in the workings of classic wow and are just circulating rumours that are not in fact true
---
I don't see why are you on this sub.
---
Because it is crystal clear that you are unable to see the implications of buffing or nerfing.
---
Tank should have lead for marking anyway.
---
Idiots like the rogue mentioned here need to chill and sap something before the pull
---
Couldn't you only banish demons and there weren't a ton of them in relevant content?
---
If they meant starter they would say starter. Early zones imply more then starter. They're WoW players and know early and starting doesn't mean the same thing.
---
But they have talked about early therefor it isn't just starter which everyone is making it out to be.
---
I’m just imagining all the human players going to do the Murloc quests in the northeast at level 9, dying repeatedly and quitting the game
---
Won't skinning prices be very low when everyone is skinning? 
---
Yeah people are so rude on the internet. Cheers 
---
No, they kept it vague because they dont know what is needed yet.  You are throwing a hissy fit with about 5 different people over this right now and its sad.  Chill out, guy.
---
*ISHNU ALLA, WEARY TRAVELLER*
---
I think you could also Banish Elementals. Iirc, warlocks were useful for Garr in that regard.
---
Thank you for proving my point
---
I'm of a similar opinion, though the Champion line is typically in the context of some larger purpose and scale than "trusted envoy." 
---
Who cares about him again? He is almost as unimportant as kungen 
---
I want no changes (that i dont agree with, mine are fine though)
---
I can't wait to grind out my pre raid bis.
---
While I didn't even bother to enter a second mythic in BFA.
---
&gt;Literally nothing the whole dungeon
---
Was somewhat of an industry standard and made it so much more rewarding to get something that improved your overall game.
---
Also most of the times you could even benefit from joining in on your friends group in one way or another.
---
What do you mean you CAN'T play them? Ofc you CAN. Just play THEIR NICHE.
---
What you want is impossible to be realize without changing Classic into something worse than BfA. Have you EVER played Vanilla, or you are talking out of your ass?
---
Have you seen what a Feral Druid, or Ret Pala or Ele/Enha Shammy or even a Boomkin CAN DO in PvP? Guess you did not. Their are beasts in PvP. Buffing their PvE side will also buff their PvP side...and make them basically way overpowered.
---
Than what? Nerf them ? Buff ALL the other classes? 
---
It will be a clusterfuck. And it won't be Classic. it won't even be BfA. It will be worse than BfA.
---
And elementals 
---
Lmao, I get what you're saying. I love rolling, but you gotta be sparing with it and take care of yourself because it can fry your brain over time. Knowing what it feels like though allows me to put myself in that mindset almost and just get lost in the music. I have to go sober sometimes to remind myself I'm not just there to get fucked up.
---
Hahaha. Oh god that’s the best you could come up with ? 
---
I'm looking forward to this. I've never really played wow, so all of this is going to be new to me. 
---
(ffxi was my old school mmo of choice, so this is probably gonna be the closest thing)
---
If you want to tank pre 50 you have to be arms, tactical mastery is without a doubt the best tanking talent warriors have access to (in a 5-man scenario at least)
---
Hey, thanks for your answer. No hate from me, I was asking the question genuinely so thank you for giving a genuine answer. 
---
I didn't know what you said about battle shout generating so much rage, in multiple mob scenario at my level which is 19, I usually thunderclap, battle shout (if its not already applied), then see how many stacks of sunder I can get up before the mobs die - I hope that this doesn't make me a shit tank? lol. In the scenario I mentioned, it was more of an "oh shit" moment, so I taunted, bloodraged and just started sundering trying to grab aggro before I went rage-oom which was of course immediately. But I appreciate that I obviously have a lot to learn! 
---
&gt;No, they kept it vague because they dont know what is needed yet.
---
So then why are 5 people so sure it is only starter then?
---
Yea for sure. The unique thing about banish is you couldn’t break the cc which made it.. I don’t know, easier I guess and took less precision.  That coupled with the fact that it was only like DM that had demons you really had to worry about for the most part.. and Mara.  
---
As a lock If shit got super real fear was a CC of sorts but you’re obviously really rolling the dice.  How I usually handled fear CC as a lock is I’d notice the healer getting beat up so I’d DPS that mob and start running backwards in the dungeon to area  we had already cleared (hopefully fully for this reason) so the mon would have some area to run around a little bit.  This was only reserved usually for when things went haywire like we pull a pat or second group or something.  Back in those days if you could live through two groups you were a super solid group but best believe you were hitting every cool down you had.  DPS has to be on point too because shit had to die quickly so the tank could get some damage reduction.  But if the tank didn’t have shieldwall or the priest wasn’t full mana going in that’s going to be a wipe most likely.
---
Quited mop there already because it was to much grind for me and league had a good season so I can’t say 
---
I think the practice developed in the event no one wanted the item, an enchanter in the group could shard it and the shard could go to a roll.
---
Yet
---
I know that you don't get it. It's ok. Not everyone can actually understand basic logic.
---
They already fucked up by not allowing a Classic only subscription
---
Banish diamond.
---
It's purple, warlocks are purple! 
---
Ok so you use your Battle Shout thus generating 275 threat divided in 3 = +-92/mob, you have the 3 mobs hitting you so you're generating rage (not much but still), Bloodrage is still generating rage and you hit one mob at the same time, you can nearly cast a second Battle shout in the next second putting your threat à 184/mob.
---
The formula for threat generated by heal is amount of heal \*0.5 divided by number of mobs. So since there is 3 mobs, the healer should already have done 1104 of heal in the first 2 seconds which is highly improbable since that more than the average HP of a lvl 19 tank and 3 mobs don't do that much damage in 2 sec. 
---
Any more question?
---
I actually did a UBRS with a shammy as one of the tanks. Surprisingly it worked pretty well. 
---
I think vanilla will be a huge shock to younger wow players lmao. 
---
Tbf, by that point your character helped kill off yogg'saron and the lich king. It's like citizens calling veterans "hero"
---
&gt; I know addons similar to this exist, but they only go so deep as to tell you your xp per hour as a whole and not which level is best to kill.
---
xp/hr is the correct metric, though. Time taken to kill mobs is only indirectly important, what matters is how much xp it ultimately earns you per hour. Looking at just ttk doesn't factor in mob density or other overhead when picking what mobs at what level to kill.
---
Might have been me! Hah. I used to tank 60 dungeons on my Shaman for a long time. Became an obscure, fun pastime. I did UBRS a large number of times.
---
At one point the joke was to give me all the spare tank gear that I could use during BWL and AQ.
---
Defently not^^ but see it always as learning cause you face much more of those people later on
---
If you buff the classes the absolute best bis will be unstoppable.
---
Cat balls
---
You're reaction was what most tank would have do :) Bloodrage into Battle Shout is the best reaction in oh shit scenario, you can then apply sunder armor and still have your taunt for a potential patrolling mob or whatever happens. 
---
PS : threat isn't equal to rage
---
Yeap.. the wait is fucking killing me right now, and I don't have anything to play.
---
Will probably roll on that new tbc "illegal" server who is opening tomorrow just to kill time til classic.
---
Pretty much all the class and spec viability changes got postponed until the 2.0 patch.  This is why I think there should be a 1.12/2.0 blended talent system, i.e. 1.12 depth with some 2.0 talents added or replacing unused talents.
---
This whole shitshow was the beginning of the end. Diversity is king. Homogenisation is the great evil
---
Why are you worried about population balance on a PvE server?
---
“DAE miss classic and hate the game now?”
---
Gurl, fear ain't so bad. Just toss recklessness on them if they start flirtin with disaster.
---
As per our last correspondence I have requested the iris scans and filed and notarized requisition forms 302-D and 419-F. Barring any unforeseen issues, ill be sending them via courier post haste. Please read section 10c of my 302 carefully as you will see that wipe was not my fault. I look forward to hearing back from you and hope my application for "LF1M DPS Deadmines no leather" has met your satisfaction. 
---
Sincerely,
---
Grimwaddle
---
To me I’d always be safer to just run em back and hope for the best that way I can focus on DPSing 
---
That's what was great about it.  People were allowed to make choices, such as whether to be helpful or to be a jerk, and you got to know who was helpful and who was not.
---
Just play what you really like and be happy dont over complicate it :) Ill be going horde for the first time when classic hits to try somthing new despite being a die hard alliance player all the way to Live 
---
So...what's your point?  Do you want people not to be jerks?  Or are you saying we should have loot trading because it won't make people jerks?
---
If you want people to not be jerks...play live.  Part of Vanilla is that the community decides how to deal with people.  You have to deal with drama.
---
With that said, loot trading does make it easier to be a jerk.  So you're advocating for people to have more opportunity to be a jerk.
---
?
---
You were teleported outside of the dungeon if you got kicked from the group. 
---
Well, 6-9 months, hoping closer to 6 obviously.
---
"Trap Square"
---
*chain traps the mob for the entire pull*
---
*mobs all die, everyone is drinking*
---
"Do you have improved traps?"
---
"No"
---
"Oh weird, we must have got lucky"
---
*cries in the corner*
---
Which for min/maxing guilds is an absolute must have.
---
Then they said they're going to shard the starting zones.
---
Nah that came later.
---
&gt;  However, Blizzard still does have some freedom when it comes to the decision of options.
---
Well, Activision have become a bigger part of Blizzard over the years, especially with current events. Just look at how they made Immortal, clearly not for the fans but just for the Chinese market as a way to make money. That is *not* the old Blizzard philosophy, and now Activisions influence has had consequences for one of Blizzards biggest franchises, Diablo.  
---
I still believe in Classic and Blizzard wanting it to be right, but what about in 1 year? or 2? If Activision keeps getting more influence they might think microtransaction will give more money to them. They already showed they can ruin a game with greed, so who knows?
---
I'm not afraid for Classic at launch, I'm afraid for Classic in the future.
---
Most raids will not allow Lupos because he consumes improved shadowbolt charges.
---
Like when they took the "PvP" specs and buffed them in Wrath to be "DPS specs", without nerfing what made them good in PvP.  So you go from frost mages having incredible CC and survivability to also being hard-hitting.  Royally screwed the balance over.
---
Because there is content that requires a group to play with and getting a group isn't very easy when there are no players on your team 
---
Have u been under a rock, they are recreating it as accurately as functionally possible to how it was back then. Scheduled for release later this year
---
Exactly. I don’t want to be the tired old trope of going from a nobody to the prophesied chosen one/garrison commander/class order hall leader/champion of the Alliance or Horde/savior of Azeroth, Draenor, Argus, etc. It doesn’t feel special to be the big hero in WoW since everyone is. I’m totally fine with being just a foot soldier/grunt. 
---
Well if you can have 4000 people on a server, and 3000 of them are Alliance, and you picked Horde, that's a lot less people to play with in PvE content. You better hope you can find a guild among those 1000 people that has a raid schedule that fits your schedule, otherwise you're fucked.
---
Oh definitely. I remember always being so nervous about it at first and my DPS would suck because I’d be so worried about it breaking and killing a healer and wiping the 40 people in raid lol.  Good times.
---
WTF, what on earth has a "tank priest" got to do with anything now? 
---
I haven't paid any attention to WoW since Burning Crusade. 
---
I was swiping through r/popular and saw this post.
---
That's super exciting yo!
---
xxxDDDDD
---
[you're right, they look pretty fucked](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ATVI/activision-blizzard/revenue)
---
&gt;because vanilla never had a situation quite like this        
---
           
---
Like what, exactly? Lots of people wanting to log in and play at once at launch in the same zones, competing for the same monsters? Because that was *definitely* a thing in vanilla, up to and including unstable and crashing servers.
---
This would be amazing
---
But how do you know that the player didn't really need the item? 
---
With Loot Trading you offer to buy loot with gold or irl money. That means that ALL dungeons and raids become GDKP. Many p-servers have banned gdkp because its an incentive for RMT and now Activision introduced loot trading in classic while Blizzard choose not to use it in Vanilla and TBC... Weird huh?
---
Loot Trading can have a HUGE impact on classic on top of the extra ninja griefing it will bring.
---
Yes (?)
---
wPvP is more entertaining than retails dungeon crawling
---
Hey,
---
Right now im playing on a fresh server which is on ZG patch. I use pummelers in BWL+MC and farm 14-15 of them per week. Once AQ is out I will quit using pummelers in MC and will keep the number of pummelers at the same, 15 or so.
---
Pummeler runs take around 3mins per run for me, 15 mins in total for 5 runs, which gives 2-3 pummelers on average, so about 50% droprate. I've been playing now in an even better guild with higher raid dps and faster kills than during the time of the video, and I've dealt already same average dps in both bwl and mc with a lot worse gear. **After first BWL with world buffs enabled i was rank 9 of all the rogues on the server in average dps.** And this was without Warchief's Blessing and with half green half blue gear.
---
About the consumables. My consume list is basically the same as for rogues, but I bring pummelers and mana pots. Then again, rogues also need to get thistle tea, poisons/sharpening stones and what not. So the difference isnt that huge. It's pretty much the pummeler farm that makes people shiver at even thinking about playing feral cat. But 15 mins for 2-3 pummelers isnt that bad imo. You can utilize the wait time for instance lockout to level alt, do irl stuff, go herb or whatever, play a battleground.
---
Yeah, actually, my account has been active since 2004. It's been that long since I played vanilla, however. I played with the flow of each expansion. I never went to private servers, and didn't PvP past Sergeant rank.
---
It's been 14 years since then, PLEASE forgive me if I don't remember EVERYTHING about a game that I haven't played since I was 17. Fucking pretentious prick.
---
Ret paladins, if you somehow get top-tier gear (tier 2, 2.5, naxx weapons/off pieces)  are PVP monsters. 
---
Same with elemental shaman
---
Feral druid can be competitive melee DPS and offer a bajillionx more utility than a rogue, and more utility than fury warr as well.  (though fury warr are still useful as temporary/emergency offtanks)
---
That leaves prot pal, enh sham, and balance druid.  Certainly less 'potentially useful' but here goes
---
Prot pal is a top-tier leveling spec for tanking dungeons or grinding AOE mobs.  They could also AOE grind in certain instances I bet as an end-game farmer.. But kind of limited utility sure.  PVE utility in raids is extremely limited, otherwise you are healing.  I have seen some talk that 30/21/0 spec is pretty viable for being healadin while having some AOE tank ability on trash pulls or whatever. 
---
Enh shaman-  Best (only)  shaman leveling spec.  Can off-tank instances while leveling, or even be main tank if the shaman is VERY dedicated and skilled and well geared.  PVP is fun but very gimmicky, and can't be considered a top-tier PVP class.  Easily burst down/focus fired and very limited healing ability vs resto or elem.  PVE Dps is ... not good. 
---
Balance druid-  Can be really nice in PVP if you have a ton of great spell power gear.  Extreme mobility of the druid, combined with very quick burst (wrath 1.5s cast + moonfire is nuts with good gear) and starfire crits/heals if you free cast.  Still go OOM quick but this isn't nearly as much an issue in PVP. 
---
So all of those specs are at least playable in some way. 
---
Yeah then you can be disappointed how blizzard fucked up vanilla. 
---
I'm not sure what this has to do with the comment you're replying to.
---
There are a lot of moves that didn't scale at all in Vanilla, or if they did scale, they scaled with stats you weren't picking up.
---
* Rogue and Druid finishing moves - don't scale with AP
---
* Hunter shots - scale with spell power
---
* Mend pet - doesn't scale at all
---
These were changed in TBC or Wrath (except Mend Pet, I believe) and those classes felt better.
---
One thing to consider is that it doesn't have to be a buff, necessarily.  You can take an ability that does 500 damage and doesn't scale, and make it deal 200 damage + 50% of attack power, so that it doesn't do as much for the rogue with only white gear and a level 1 dagger, but it does more for someone in T2 and T3 gear.
---
The biggest class balance issues I see in Vanilla are scaling issues.  Druid tanks fall behind, hunters fall behind, other classes scale better and start to pull ahead.
---
\---
---
I'm on team #nochanges, and I don't think they should implement these changes until TBC, which I would like to see.  But I will play devil's advocate and say that affecting scaling is not necessarily always a buff, and that it has different implications than general buffs to the class.
---
(For example, making Rip and Ferocious Bite scale won't affect balance, bear, or resto).
---
People seems to miss the point that Blizzard will probably fuck this up.
---
So because you were told. Great.
---
In raids, Nightfall is a top 10 debuff, bringing more DPS than any individual player.  Hunters have the highest uptime on nightfall due to Wing Clip spamming, so even though their personal DPS contribution is small, it does work.
---
I think you had to train for it? Not sure how much it was.
---
Would you join a UBRS run with Group Loot and Loot Trading?
---
I never played "later", and I very distinctly remember it. Patch notes, all the way through BC don't mention it either, so I guess it was there from the beginning.
---
Because that's what blizzard did with their bring the player not the class bullshit. You think is going to be different now?
---
What? This reply doesn't even make sense. If I wanted to raid, I had to be in Holy spec with certain pieces of gear, which included cloth and mail intellect/mp5 pieces. Yes. 
---
But why would I play classic for that? 
---
Well, if a spec is there, it should be viable.  But the question is, what is "viable".  In my opinion (therefore I can't be wrong) the minimum you need is that:
---
1. Each spec is viable in some area (i.e. it might be useless in solo and raids, but is great for PvP)
---
2. Each class has a spec that is viable in some area (i.e. a Warlock leveling as demonology, DPSing as destruction, and PvPing as Affliction)
---
If one of these conditions is not met, then something is wrong.  So if you have a class where there is a spec that is not used at all, then that spec needs something to do.  Or if you have a class that simply cannot effectively PvP or has nothing to offer a raid, then you have a problem.
---
Actually AQ is the dream patch for feral where you get vast majority of your BiS items. Naxxramas is where cat starts to drop a bit since there are so few upgrades and the other classes get insane upgrades. But then again this does not matter that much because once naxx is cleared the game is pretty much over
---
You shouldn't be avoiding streamers imo.
---
I don't like streamers either but I don't wanna end up in a dead server.
---
Asmongold and soda are planning to be on the same server but different factions, that'll make a big server with great balance.
---
Hey, thanks for actually explaining instead of just assuming everyone knows everything about the fucking game. I appreciate you for taking the time to type this out.
---
So we're in agreement that every class had a minimum of one viable spec for raiding, which means that every class was viable.
---
What you're looking for is "every spec was viable".  And in that case, yes, but not always for raiding.
---
I was very undergeared compared to a lot of my guildmates, I was not even close to BiS gear at the time when i recorded the VODs and you can do really well in AQ and also in a lot of fights in Naxxramas. The more movement there is the more mana sustain you have since you regenerate mana during the downtime to dps
---
The entire vibe has changed in those games. You're part of a group of heroes who is known to have killes many great foes. And this in part makes you an anti-hero at worst.
---
Let the PLAYERS decide who the heroes on their server are. 
---
Like you, I have no issue with sharding the starting zones for the first 2 weeks.
---
What I have issue with is the precedent it sets, if they'll shard any other high-volume events.
---
Are you implying that op's post is not true or do you just find the tone belittling?
---
So do research on realm pop before you pick a server!

---
Sheep pull or stun goblins or they will spawn robots.
---
Not really. You are known to be part of some battles. Canon wise the kills are split between factions , organizations and really rarely a specific group with names. 
---
Read the new illidan novel there you get a good example of how raids really are 
---
50:50
---
I'm pretty sure I never went into UBRS without a master looter unless it was a guild run, so it's not THAT hard for me to comprehend.
---
I've been planning on making a mock-up of what this could look like.  Stay tuned, as posting it here is tantamount to sacrilege and it will get downvoted to hell.
---
In Vanilla the heroes are the players who have played a shit ton and have the best gear and rarest mounts and have earned their status.
---
Classes ends early June, then nothingness until early September. Right smack in the middle of that is Classic - Life's good.
---
And here you can find the logs for that first BWL with world buffs on the new server:

---
-9 downvotes shows that the community is well situated to ruin WoW a second time.
---
I LOVE doing that as a challenge. Or just 4 dps and a healer.
---
Did WC with 3 priests and 2 mages. Was hectic, but surprisingly easy.
---
I'm 100% joking 
---
I’m a little late here, and even though I had a level 60 rogue and warrior, I only really know about being a Horde Druid and a tribal leatherworker. If anyone has any questions don’t hesitate to reach out to me I’ll be happy to answer them time/work permitting.
---
Exactly, the it really is a problem once sharding is introduced, because then the line can be moved. Personally I totally get sharding at launch, but not if it means it might come for later events. Even if they promise now things might change after a year. I don't want that "fear" over me.
---
Honestly, I've tried server launch that had more than Blizzlike population and obviously they had way less money to buy stable servers than Blizzard. It was actually fun to me with fighting for mobs, but then again, I played a hunter and I really like that sort of stuff. I can't blame Blizzard for trying to make a "proper" launch.
---
Yes.
---
&gt; The doomsayers claim blizzard are going to try pulling cloud hosting which, not being all that knowledgeable, sounds like a bad situation.
---
We know too little about the architecture of the game to tell whether or not a cloud solution or dedicated realm servers would be better. Also, "cloud" can mean a lot of different things, ranging from  in-house private clouds or having the complete infrastructure run by Amazon.
---
People like to claim that cloud instances are small and less powerful, but that's just conjecture. You can get quite beefy servers from cloud vendors, and with a private cloud, your instances can get as powerful as you want them to be. It's not about cloud vs. dedicated machine. In either case, the question is simply: how much is Blizzard willing to invest?
---
tl,dr: we don't know the impact cloud hosting has/would have on the game.
---
Shoulder Slot should be Head Slot! iirc it's level 30 before most classes can get one (not including AH!)
---
&gt; sharding will be
---
When did Blizzard ever use the word "will" when talking about sharding? Can you show one quote or video?
---
So you admit it's somewhat true?
---
Because its a laggy mess that cant support more than 60players on the same spot in retail?
---
Because everybody runs around with 10 defensive CDs, so you cant nuke them effectively? 
---
I played on a p-server with 12k people online at the same time on lanuch day. They used dynamic spawns and that solved that.
---
Except it is. Numbers in BFA are so inflated it's damn stupid.
---
"Oh look at this nice green cloth bracelet on the AH - Price 7000 gold."
---
1. Not entirely true since people compare gear with each other or post best in slot items. Specially if it is from a new raid and good looking
---
2. legendarys don’t exist in bfa 
---
3. inflation is part of every mmo. We should be proud that blizzard was able to keep it reasonable over the years. Other games abandoned gold and use rare items to trade 
---
4.  ccing is not really much better than nothing, social wise. But we shouldn’t compare classic dungeons to normal dungeons in retail. Compare it to the most played ones, which are mythic + and most people talk in them.
---
5. that is not true specially not in bfa were every persons insults you as unknown stranger and you have to work and get their trust 
---
I knew a really good Shammy tank up until late game content. He was arguably better than most prot warrior I grouped with.
---
If you get felstriker in UBRS with Master Looter with Loot Trading people will now whisper you and beg for it, offer you thousands of gold and maybe 500usd. Do you see any problem with this at all?
---
Nuking is so much fun and good gameplay. 
---
Most classes have 2 deff cds
---
Classic and retail will run on the same engine and it lags mostly only if people try to make it lag or there are 100 people spamming abilities and toys 
---
Ah yes, when gold has value.
---
Server choice will be jointly chosen with the other 39 tbd people I plan to play with, whether it's PvE or PvP I don't really care all that much tbh, I was never super into PvP but it was fun from time to time, though I plan to play healer this time so I won't be a monster in PvP this time around.
---
My first ever server was Stormscale-EU, which upon release was horrible with queues and everything so I'm not looking back on it with fond memories, more so with The Maelstrom-EU where I spent all of my time since it started.
---
I could not care less about streamers and what they do as long as it doesn't interfere with my own playing in any way.
---
I wouldn't say warriors are good at 1vX, simply because having more enemies often means enough abilities to kite the warrior. 
---
1vX I'd probably go with mage, lock and a skilled hunter (but mostly the first two mentioned).
---
You can look at the top upvoted post on r/wow for the teaser that was released at blizzcon 2017.  Enjoy the hype with the rest of the comments haha
---
Sound, but you only have proven that it isn't entirely like that.
---
Do I suppose if you strip away the exaggeration..?
---
Anyway, no point arguing about that, hope to see you in the summer.
---
tfw hibernate
---
Don’t bother - this kid is in every thread white knighting BFA like he’s getting paid.
---
Thanks, great advice!
---
So you're admitting you DO in fact claim what you just denied? 
---
And no, it's still wrong. Classes are not "all the same", even when specs that weren't viable before become viable. Did you even play TBC or Wrath? 
---
A third option would be to not have loot trading and to discard all GM tickets.
---
Noobs have to learn someday.
---
The problem is. Stripping the exaggerations away and the false informations would remove the reason for this post. It was meant to show ways in which classic is better not different.
---
But yeah no point arguing. Have a nice one
---
It boggles my mind that something so miniscule as sharding in starting zones at launch could actually make people want to go back to poorly run, could shutdown-at-any-moment, corrupt-as-fuck private servers. It's actually hilarious. 
---
My guess is the people saying this never played on private servers. At least with Classic you'll have a character that lasts and a fair fight instead of corrupt GM's. 
---
I was playing a druid during beta / pre-release of Vanilla.  One of my class quests took me to MoonGlade to retrieve something from the lake.  As I would dive down to retrieve it, there were elite mobs that would aggro near or on the bottom.
---
And yes, the Shaman fire totem fight was nerfed as most couldn't either obtain the items and/or kill the elite boss in a timely manner.  This was done around the same time that mobs were being removed from instances so that the instances could be cleared without wiping.
---
Probably during Classic. I'm done with private servers and retail until then.
---
I wonder how many know where this is located.  :)
---
Exactly. And in vanilla there will be constant fights with 200+ people. Not only for fun but for contesting world dragons, wiping enemy raids in BRM or AQ entrance etc.
---
Nuking indeed is a good gameplay mechanic. Nobody should survive 2 enemy DDs hammering them.
---
The arena minigame made it that way, because they couldnt sell 15second PvP engagements as E-sports even though its crazy fun if you clash, you go all out, one survives with 10% HP and the other bites the dust.
---
I'm mostly excited for low numbers. Yeah old talents and all the other jazz is nice, but returning to characters that don't have a million health is going to be refreshing. Along with that comes manageable stats on gear, getting an extra 2 stamina from any piece is an upgrade you could actually feel in your character.
---
Any quest were you need to collect an item off the ground with a 15 minute minute respawns like Bingles Missing Supplies in Loch Modan and A Refugee's Quandary in Coldridge Valley. Both are huge bottlenecks on most private servers with people standing in a circle around the item spam clicking to get it or else wait 15 minutes for another go. 
---
You have managed to avoid the biggest shitshow of discussion concerning a game in a very long time, I almost wish I didn't know about it and just stumbled upon it few days before launch.
---
Oops lol, looks like I'm sleeping on the couch...
---
This is what I remember except banish could be triangle or purple diamond too 
---
No, I don't pick based on performance. But then again, I play hunter - tranq shot for PvE and fine in PvP.
---
So what are everyone's predictions on when the beta will start? I'm hoping March at the latest, if not February. 
---
=P  OK good.  Tough to read internet context!
---
This is what i was used to, and on the other private servers players followed this
---
I'm going to research all the popular streamers and what servers they'll be rolling on. Then I'm going to stay the fuck away from every one of those.
---
Yeah was just trying to highlight the spec is much better a bit later then a lot of options and not to base starting class on your awesome video. The spec has poor item choices earlier on do to bad itemization.  Once you can get Draconic Maul and DFT you start to gain momentum. 
---
Me too (unless every other server is dead)
---
what is this new server?
---
You're completely wrong, and clearly never played vanilla.  Either that or you're just not looking at things correctly.
---
Vanilla launch was COMPLETELY different.  For one, we still used physical CDs back then.  Which means people had to go physically buy the game, come home, install it, etc.  This in and of itself caused a metering of new players joining, saying nothing of the myriad technical issues people were experiencing which also metered the player-base.  Second of all, Vanilla had about 100 servers at launch - they've announced that Classic will only have a handful.  
---
This is a completely different scenario.  You're arguably going to have MORE people wanting to play in the first week of Classic than you did in Vanilla, there's going to be more immediacy in those people joining (everyone will have instant access, as opposed to trickling in over the course of a few days due to purchase time, install time, etc.) and you're only going to have a fraction of the servers that we had at Vanilla.
---
So tell me again how this is the same situation?
---
I really hope blizzard implements some controls to prevent servers from becoming too one-sided.
---
With ATVI's stock price I'm praying for a early June launch to hopefully pick up some subscribers before earnings.
---
I also PM'd you regarding the new server.  
---
Played some on Light's Hope but would like something "new". 
---
I will forever link to u/duckst0rm's [comment on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ab7ikk/remember_we_are_the_target_audience_for_the/ecydg8p/) because I think it's the most persuasive and sane take on this whole issue.
---
You skin and vendor it. No one will have ANY money if you play at launch so its pointless to try to sell it. 
---
Elementals too. Banish was crazy powerful in BRD
---
Just my guild that used Jaffa cake then? (circle)
---
You need to learn how to read. He clearly says he does not want changes, he wants to know if there were rebalances, would people play another class. It's a hypothetical question that could be rephrashed as "if it was not for balance issues, would you still play the same class?"
---
Yep, there was always that one DPS who just didn't get the memo and you always had to adjust on the fly.
---
I mean, I started playing Christmas 2004 so I guess I wasn't in literally at launch, but even a month afterwards and beyond we were fighting server queues, crowded start zones, and downtime. I had several days of free time credited to my account because of the latter.          
---
              
---
But really I was just looking for the explanation as to why you thought vanilla's situation was so different and you gave it, so thanks.
---
It is called hyperbole.
---
And of course. TBC for life!
---
I love casual pvper like you, no idea what they are talking. But aslong as it is big and flashy they are happy :)
---
Horde rogue sneaking into west fall for the bandit mask
---
lol, how did you end up on r/classicwow ?
---
Like what for example?
---
r/popular
---
Believe me, it's not going to be comparable.  The player counts and concentration are going to be completely incomparable to what we experienced at lauch.
---
And I played Week 1 in vanilla.  The biggest hurdles back then is that servers have queues and were super unstable.  So while zones were crowded, they weren't overcrowded.  The server queues prevented that.
---
So unless you want server queues that are about nine hours long (because the player numbers on a per server basis are going to blow away what we saw in vanilla), sharding is going to be necessary for the first few weeks in the starting/low level zones.
---
&gt; Paladin tank - give them a taunt and increase holy threat from righteous fury by 20%. (The idea is to allow them wiggle room for more def gear)
---
Regarding giving Prot Paladins a taunt, here's what Kevin Jordan had to say a couple months ago on the ClassiCast podcast:
---
&gt; “We wanted his taunt to be more of a rescue operation than a direct insult, right? Like, a Warrior is just like: ‘Hey you, you’re a jerk, come attack me.’ Very direct. I’m intimidating. Whereas for a Paladin the idea was: ‘Oh, one of my friends is in trouble, I’ll cast a spell on my friend and it will transfer the threat to me and get that monster to come over.’ So that’s more in mind with the thematic of: He’s a protector and a saver, rather than, you know, like a direct yelling and screaming.
---
&gt; So that’s was the thematic approach. The mechanics were difficult because it was much harder to switch targets and use an ability on a friend without the smart targeting stuff that eventually went in. It wasn’t just, you know, hit taunt on the thing that you were already targeting, so we had some mechanical difficulties. He was fine generating threat as long as the thing was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat—whereas the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt, you can’t take it away, right? Like, anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? Why would you do this to us? Just give us the thing back! It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. 
---
&gt; We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt so we were still experimenting and learning as we went, but our goal and our philosophy was to always do it different; make the bear tank a certain way, make the Paladin tank a certain way, make the Warrior tank a certain way, and to a lesser extent make the Void Walker tank a certain way. Just have him feel differently, have them function differently, so that they give a different experience and it changes the dynamic of the group and how people have to play and there’s different things going on.”
---
1 minute of semi useful but widely know info, 5 minutes sucking the dick of PvP servers.  We get it, you want to gank lowbies.  FFS get past it.  
---
I am slightly curious how PvP servers will do longer term when people know at launch they can be avoided.  I know so many people that were only on PvP servers because they didn't know better and were committed to their toons.  But this go the majority of people said they wanted PvP and would roll PvP.  I hope that happens, and I hope everyone enjoys their choice.  But I suspect those servers will go to shit when there aren't unwilling people to gank.
---
Either way I'll be enjoying my PvE, quest in peace, carebear realm.  In fact they should name a realm US-Carebear.  That's where I'm rolling!    
---
This is my plan too. Already started on a pserver and havin fun playing it slow.
---
DPS was just fine. I was consistently top 5 dps in MC/BWL and top 10 in AQ40. It was only in Naxx that the scaling was atrocious. 
---
While what you are saying makes sense I feel like you are forgetting the reason then. A change just for the sake of change is always a bad idea. What exactly would the reason to add scaling without buffing be? Also, at what point is "not a buff" considered? If it scales it might become better with BiS. If you scale so it won't then it's overall a nerf for most people. 
---
Simply put, if you add scaling and *don't* want it to be a buff then it will be a nerf compared to static dmg. 
---
So why would anyone *ever* want that?
---
Never played No Man's Sky but I have 250 hours in PoE. The game is incredible. GGG actually give a damn about the game and you can tell. It also has a great amount of depth and complexity if that's your thing.
---
He's saying you've never been in a position to manage a real world project with budgetary constraints.
---
Go back to running errands for your boy-king, Alliance scum.
---
Just spit-balling but maybe faction specific server queues (in the early days) or advertised temporary faction exclusive XP bonuses (to encourage re rolling on that server) once the populations are more stable.
---
Nightmare scenario though:
---
Activision CFO: "You think a couple million people will play this thing?"
---
Devs: "Yes!  It is great!"
---
Activision CFO: "So if we charge them all something nominal, say $10 for the download, how many WONT play?"
---
Devs: "... well not too many, but we told them..."
---
Activision CFO: "Great!  That's an easy 10-20 million in the books!  Thanks for the meeting."
---
While everyone here would be quick to say "I'm not paying $10" you KNOW that $10 is nothing and you'd pay it anyway.  Something to consider.  
---
Any game will never be 100% perfect and developers will always have things they'd like to improve. But vanilla WoW is one of the greatest games of all time. Fundamentally, it works very well, and is not "broken." 
---
Even the original WoW development team caused major problems with well-intentioned changes. Modern Blizzard would be far worse. 
---
I've already planned my whole level 60 gear progression from BiS preraid to post KT. It'll be interesting to see how far I get!
---
one day, you'll come back to these comments and your face will turn red
---
&gt;Go to town and spam trade about their activities.
---
And when the guy replies back that *you* are the ninja and now you just troll and he has his friends backing him up on it? Then you get the reputation of a ninja and you don't even have your loot.
---
&gt; Fundamentally, it works very well, and is not "broken."
---
Then your definition of broken isn't the dictionary definition of broken.
---
That's fine to want to redefine a word to mean what you want it to mean, but it's still wrong to the rest of us.
---
&gt; I'm saying it won't be common
---
You have no argument for that, though. Human history says it will be rather common.
---
&gt;  running your own groups.
---
So let me get this straight, you think Blizzard should spend time making a change from vanilla and then players have to totally avoid a part of the game (PuG) just in order to not encounter this change? How in the world is it not just better to not make the change then?
---
I don't remember vote kicking in vanilla, but [googling shows the party vote kick system was implemented in WotLK](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vote_Kick). I've tried to find what the pre-lich king party mechanics were, but haven't yet.
---
I'm confused, people are talking about being a character in modern World of Warcraft.. Not how the lore portrays the characters but how NPCs interact with your character.  It's no secret that as a character you are regarded as a hero who has killed really big and evil things, regardless of the canon. 
---
Exactly. 
---
I prefer the MMO in an MMO. Not playing chess in a  3v3 environment. If I want competitive e-sports, I play wc3 or CSGO, not WoW. 
---
I want to play 50v50 who can stay longest in Astranaar before one party gets kicked out.
---
Damn haha probably better than mine, i remember massive square tiles all over the floor and endless crashing when walking into Orgrimmar, now this is my new PC just bought 2 months ago: [https://imgur.com/a/dYJZFU2](https://imgur.com/a/dYJZFU2) , might be a bit overkill but hey ho.
---
&gt; People keep cheering about the Classic community being so great.
---
Classic will have a great community, I have no doubt. Just like Vanilla had. But vanilla also had a shitton of idiots, and so will Classic.
---
I like the idea of the faction specific server queues.  It could solve the problem of random people wanting to roll there, while allowing for the people that are part of a group to have to wait (if only for a few days/hours).  
---
The xp bonus I think would be poorly received because of the simple fact that it's not vanilla. 
---
It's an interesting problem for sure.  Beyond faction imbalance, we'll be faced the aftermath of the initial wave of tourists, hard-core #nochange-purists that will find fault with something, and people that just plain don't like it.  It'll be interesting to see how it's handled.
---
Ever heard of pressing enter after a few thoughts?  Come on man.
---
I can agree with his statements. Instead of a direct taunt could give the paladin a way to cast a taunt on a player to match their threat (or 105%) then give the paladin a short duration buff increasing holy threat for 5-10s would allow the paladin to judgement and Max rank concecrate to snap the threat. It would at the very least be an engaging tanking mechanic.
---
There will be either official or a community armory like current legacyplayers.com where you can check the equipment history of the character. 
---
Yes, you will be able to loot an item to your friend once, but if you get caught (which will be super easy thing to do) then it's a huuuge rip. 
---
You would put it on your off hand afaik. I played a warrior so was 2h.
---
The gear options for feral in early content are quite the same as for dps warr. Just few items less, but having access to pummeler already makes up to the lack of gear very well
---
Summer is till the 21st of september though, Launch could be anywhere between the 21nd of june and the  20th of september. I'm hoping a early summer release also, but i don't think Blizzard often launches stuff before the summer holidays, usually late august - september. 
---
Late april im guessing
---
Well, technically anything they do to fix this isn't going to be "vanilla" because this was an unsolved problem at the time. 
---
I trust blizzard to do whats best for the longevity of classic as long as its in the spirit of vanilla even if "omfg this line of code didnt exist in vanilla".
---
But I do agree that an xp bonus isn't in the spirit of vanilla.
---
Not in bfa. Most people talk very unkind ingame to your character. We are strangers to the kul Tiran and zandalari. 
---
I'm just throwing arbitrary numbers here, but it will get the point across.  Let's say your average player at level 60 has 500 attack power.  A player who is well-geared from dungeons and world drops will have 700 attack power.  Tier 1 player will have 800 attack power, Tier 2 will have 1000.  A fresh level 60 may be down at 300.
---
Now you have an ability that does 1000 damage.  So instead, you take that ability down to 400 damage + attack power.  The poorly geared player will see it as a huge nerf as it goes down to 700.  The average player gets a slight nerf and goes down to 900.  The well-geared player sees it as a buff and goes up to 1100, and so on.
---
By the time you're in Tier 3, it becomes a buff.
---
What this means is it's not just "oh, you made it scale so everyone is stronger."  It's "oh, you made it scale, so now gear matters more for this ability."  When you adjust the scaling, and compensate the base value, then there will be a nerf for some and a buff for others.
---
The idea is to make it so that in Tier 3, the ability doesn't fall behind to the point that it becomes useless (and often the class with it), but without making it stronger in the lower-geared content where it was already pretty strong.
---
Sweet jesus, a bit overkill?  That is one sweet VR porn machine you got there.. I don't think I'd ever leave my house.
---
Let him die.  He'll learn.  Eventually.
---
How do you propose to pick a launch day server based on his criteria?  It was a perfectly laid out scenario and completely legit concern.  Picking a server that goes 4/1 against you is a terrible handicap.  It affects progress at all levels from starter zones to endgame.  
---
Thick leather will always be valuable because leatherworkers can turn it into leather gear which vendors for a high amount.  Most of the money you make from skinning is vendored through leatherworkers.  You'll see it from the first week "Buying thick leather 1.2g per stack COD anytime" because they can turn it into more gold.
---
I just wanted to hop in and say that I'm the same way.
---
I'm waiting for the fruit to ripen, so to speak, on Classic.
---
They're both BiS for their level range. 
---
Yep, it's similar to Righteous Defense, which commanded up to three mobs attacking an ally to attack you instead—added when they finally got around to revisiting the spec in TBC.
---
If you want to pvp in BGs the queues will be a lot faster if you are on the minority side.
---
Ahh, yeah I haven’t played BFA because I heard it was a dumpster fire.  But I played legion for a few weeks and the way they talked to my character made it seem like I was on par with sargeras lol. 
---
Yes, this so much. This is what people don't get, you have way more time for other stuff in the game, if you raid hardcore. 
---
Lol. I think I saw that most often used for saps.
---
It really depended on the class you played. And it was mostly khadgar who talked like that. The wardens , valajahr, nightborn and so on expected you to work hard to gain their trust. 
---
And people call every expansion a dumbstar Fire. 
---
Remember garrisons ? People like them now days and miss them 
---
Why?
---
Classes are more balanced than a lot of people think. The balance philosophy of Classic is different than of modern wow or other mmos for that matter. Every single class is capable of contributing to PvP/dungeons/raids. The classes however are much more heterogenized than in BfA. Every class has a clear role to play. Not every class should be able to dps on a higher level. If Paladins and Druids could tank as well as Warriors, Warriors would be almost obsolete.
---
Some classes are good at Soloplay (Hunter for example) others are very adaptable and can take on different roles, however they don't excel at any of them (druid). Others are essential for any group but have difficulties in soloplay (warrior)
---
Every class in Classic is there for a reason. The game is pretty well balanced, it's just the balance philosophy that is different.
---
Also most specs are actually useful if people stop looking at raiding only. 
---
Every Warrior spec is viable in game
---
Every Hunter spec is viable at some point in the game
---
Frost and Fire spec fore mage are viable and Arcane adds some usefulness to the other two
---
just a few examples. Most specs have some place in the game. Just because we don't see all the spec in raiding doesn't mean they are useless in other aspects of the game.
---
Almost everyone gets one character to the upper levels if they truly enjoy the game. I usually get two characters in the 50-60 range before my speed slows.
---
I love so many classes though, so I always have a bunch of 30ish alts.
---
I honesty didn’t play WoD either but you have to admit the hate for BFA seems to eclipse the hate WoD got at the time.  People seemed to like legion even though it had a couple faults.  As for the way they talked to you in legion I played near the end as a rogue and holy crap I felt like a god because of the way I was talked to.  Even illidan himself made me feel super powerful. 
---
Except it doesn't as they're configurable cloud servers.
---
They don't need to fix or remove it, they can just turn it off like they have for current RP retail realms.
---
6 months is optimistic. I set my 3 of my 4 vacations for vacations for last week of July, last week of August, and last week of September. 
---
Playing a lot of survival games with my GF to pass the time

I wouldn't play at 4K personally, I stay at 1440p even though I have a RTX 2080 Ti [https://imgur.com/a/dYJZFU2](https://imgur.com/a/dYJZFU2) , not only is it a lot more fps but you can get a much better 1440 monitor with a 144 refresh rate whereas most 4k have only 60.
---
Well if you fail to see the difference between the mess that non-sharded starting zones will be vs the defias messenger quest I don't know what to tell you.
---
Astral Recall saves the day.
---
asmon said he'd play on pve tho ... didn't he?
---
Need much ventrilo
---
Yeah I'm worried too because of how Blizzard fucked up basically everything in 2018. 
---
The thing is, if Blizzard fucks up even Classic somehow it's free advertisement for the other MMOs and private servers, because BfA is terrible so only minority will go back to retail. The rest will start searching for a new MMO.
---
Wod was a good Expansion raid wise and after seasons 1 was fixed pvp was okay too. The problem was our site of raiding and pvp there was no other content which made people stop playing. Which is kinda ironic saying that here , since classic has the same problem they accuse Wod to have. 
---
Legion was called the best expansion since woltk, and that during its life time. Give it a few more years and it will be more loved than mop and maybe woltk. 
---
I played a Druid in legion and my order hall i was just one more archdruid helping other archdruids. Out site of Argus and khadgar i don’t remember much hero calling.
---
Bfa has a lot of stuff which could be done better. But realistically we reached a point were the bfa hate is more a meme getting hyped up by streamers. Bfa is not a bad game but legion was such a surprise that people expected a lot from bfa 
---
Hi, /u/ithilras
---
Netherwing
---
what
---
I'm going to play Horde on a PvE Server. No queue times in BGs. That would be my true Classic experience.
---
Never bothered me, being in the minority.
---
Perhaps you aren’t from the US so the context is lost on you.  The Vietnam War is our historic war that most strongly resonates with jungle warfare.  Not just jungle warfare, but guerilla jungle warfare.
---
I wanna roll a Dwarf Priest.  Disc or Holy is the way to go?  My main goal is to be a healer.  And what would be the best leveling and lvl 60 professions for this?
---
Champion, in the context WotLK used it, told us as players, that our characters were the best that the Alliance and Horde had to offer. We are the best fighters on the planet.
---
Cataclysm told us we were not *just* heroes, but ***THE*** Heroes. We, the players, saved Azeroth from Deathwing. Not like how the Alliance took down Onyxia or even made it first to the top of ICC, canonically.
---
We were the elite soldiers, begged by Varian Wrynn himself, to save his son. The elite brigade who tagged along with Khadgar through the portal, the generals who command the military and naval fleet. The sole hero, canonically, entrusted with an artifact weapon given to us by lore characters.
---
And now we're the lone savior of Azeroth. Boring.
---
It’s not the streamers that are the problem, it’s the brain dead masses that will follow them there.
---
Most wont roll on pvp servers so that’s an option.  I’m planning RP-PvP myself.
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/broken
---
Oh? Which definition are you using? I'm using it as "not working properly." A game as popular and beloved as vanilla WoW certainly "works." I don't see "has slight imperfections" on the list. 
---
1/10 bait.
---
i never experienced this at all since i played on a PvE server in vanilla.  By the time i leveled characters on a PvP server the lower zones were empty.  I leveled on Tichondrius from 1-90 and only had 3 or 4 runins out in the world.
---
There is no real stigma against any race or gender. Our guild leader in Vanilla was an undead female but most assuredly a dude in real life. You might occasionally get some mouth breather whispering you calling you a name for playing a female character, but I promise it is not a real issue.
---
Just play what you want, you’ll be welcome. No Pandas for you though.
---
First of all that was only ever an issue for Diremaul, in Patch 1.3 Blizzard reduced the maximum number of players that could enter an instance, 40 for raids, 15 for UBRS, 5 for Dire Maul and 10 for all other raids. The mechanic that teleported you out of the dungeon for not being in the group was also a Vanilla thing, I remember this specifically because I had to create a system of juggling 1 or 2 extra players in dungeons (By making a few remove/invite player macros) so I could run a 6-7 player party (so we could do quests and just steamroll the dungeons) and I needed to juggle players to constantly reset the out of party players teleport timer.
---
I mean, I may not always say it - but I'm that guy.
---
If we're planning or coordinating, sure man, no problem.  But some dudes just move ridiculously slow.  If we're handling the mobs well, I like to see the group accelerate the pace.
---
Actually, no.  I think blizzard shouldn't introduce loot trading at all - but if they do it's not going to break the game and make it unplayable.  Also - it's still a PUG if you start the group, master loot, and make agreements with players in your group about reserved loot (as a condition of being in your group of course).   If I play classic for 2 years and I run into this loot problem 2 or 3 times, I would consider that to be "not that common."  You may consider one occurrence to be the end of the world (OMG HOW COULD YOU BLIZZARD /WRISTS).
---
Make some about her or youre gonna have a bad time.
---
“I don’t have time to video game anymore”. *plays candy crush and pinterests all night*
---
female dwarfs priest in a robe in many ways look pretty much like female pandas. cute, humble and curvy. could be a decent alternative for you.
---
I don't know what discord that comes from, first time i see it though. But i was going off https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w which to me is a bit more official, since it was on a official Blizzard media event. And there they cover some of the biggest concerns with stuff like "There should only be one Kazzak" and "Players should be fighting over a limited resource". While not 100% definitive, their stance clearly shows in that clip to me. He also mentioned stuff like Valley of Trials and Elwynn which are starter zones  to me as i believe all 1-12 zones back in the day were said to be the "starter zones" in the official guides, then again i reckon Early and starter can be used in the same way.
---
I would like to see no sharding, however we can all agree that Vanilla launch was a shitshow with the queue's and the server crashes, downtime, unexpected maintenance, and a bad one at it, they have stated quite a few times that they don't want to repeat that. And Classic probably will attract a lot bigger crowd on launch day. If theres a better alternative to sharding i would like to see it, however i haven't hear anyone actually having a better solution that posibly avoid or lower the amount of queue's than sharding. Sure some ppl have mentioned dynamic spawns, but those forced every 1 sec respawns as seen on some pservers at launch are a lot more immersion breaking than Sharding is for 1-2 zones. 
---
This is always the gamble.  You want to be on a popular server, but you don't want to end up on one of those with queues.
---
I haven't played Retail in ages though.  Do servers still have queues, or has hardware advanced enough to avoid that?
---
Smart, get in combat so they can’t drink 
---
Whats the fuckup? I actually believe that a single "WoW Sub" is actually the best thing they can do. I don't think splitting the subs would help at all. 
---
If I trusted the player who was master looter I would.  If I didn't trust him/her, and I needed to run UBRS, I would put a group together myself.  If I didn't trust the master looter, but went on the UBRS run anyway, I do so understanding that loot shenanigans may take place and I accept the risk rather than assembling and running my own group.  
---
I have completely run out of other games to play. I have exhausted so many different options. I'm an old Counter-Strike guy and recently picked up CS:GO just so that I wouldn't lose my mind. I'm actually doing more real world stuff now while I wait for classic to come and suck the life out of me again. This is quite the cycle.
---
And THEN what if he says something disparaging about your mother!?!?!  It'll all be over for you then, better transfer servers.  
---
Ugh, both that druid in Darkshore with the horn you have to toot periodically, and the guy in the cave in Redridge Mountains make shudder just thinking about them. The Defias Traitor is a must, but then you're usually a bunch of people and Moonbrook is often full of people anyway.
---
There's a comment on wowhead along the lines of "this quest is why Nelfs get wisp form" and I agree 120%.
---
&gt;however i haven't hear anyone actually having a better solution that posibly avoid or lower the amount of queue's than sharding
---
This isn't a problem that needs to be solved though. That is the issue with people pro-sharding. Seeing issues where there isn't one.
---
&gt;Or, if you are worshiped, you're worshiped
---
I thought this was taking a much more goldshire inn-y turn. 
---
Oh? I thought that people associated warriors as being raging alpha males. But, I appreciate the feedback and thank you for the reassurance. Sucks no pandas though :/
---
As someone who just leveled a druid to 60, tanking every instance along the way, I can confirm that this server is full of impatient as fuck dps.  Hunters are bad, but mages are even worse (in general).  Always pulling, always doing stupid shit, always popping all cooldowns on trash packs because they have 6 elites wailing on their asses.
---
Stop aoe'ing mobs before I even have enough rage to swipe.  Stop pulling with polymorph.  Stop shooting your load in the first 2 seconds of combat and then kiting all the way back to the start of the dungeon because they are all chasing you.
---
This server is bad for these types of players.  There are tons of them.  Tons.  And Classic will be even worse, by far.
---
I want to pvp primarily and always be able to get in bgs and premades, but I don't want to have to respec for 5mans or raids. I am looking at warrior, mage, and paladin. Any of these able to fill those requirements? Any other classes that fill those requirements?
---
Well, there will probably be forums and surveys doing this.
---
There's also no shame in rerolling on a new server.  It's what I did in TBC so I could play with my friend.  A few months into TBC I abandoned my 70 hunter to start over as a druid.  Best decision I ever made (not going hunter -&gt; druid, but playing with my best friend).
---
I wonder what it’s gonna be like leveling without access to BGs.  I started actual vanilla well after BGs and did a lot of pvp leveling up.  With them not in classic release from the start it’s going to be quite different from my original experience.  I was exalted with Warsonf Outriders somewhere in my 50s I did so much pvp and was probably close to revered with AB when I hit 60.
---
Your made legitimately made me laugh XD.
---
Farming furbolgs from 58 to 60. 
---
hmm... back then, I had no care about how humans look like IRL, but black skin with blonde hair and beard looked weird, like a black chocolate cake with glaze XÐ or something
---
ooh damn, now I just recalled the time I entered the character creation screen for the first time. And I looked at orc and said "basically cloned Shrek" XÐ
---
I literally made a topic on this exact consideration months ago.
---
Great post, but you forgot to mention how &lt;Empty raid slot&gt; also reduces the amount of healing necessary on fights with AoE raid damage. It also makes positioning easier on fights where damage can chain between players. Too many melee on C'thun taking massive chaining eye beam damage? Never again with &lt;Empty raid slot&gt; on your side!
---
Hahaha thats funny!! I was thinking more of tauren but the female is pretty ugly. Female dwarf could be a nice alternative! Looking at some screenshots, they are pretty cute!
---
and it was. After killing a few, I had like a few copper, and thought of the hard work it would be to get 72 copper for some item from some vendor. Then, I learned that you can sell your items to him, and suddenly had 3 silver or something
---
Thats bosses not mobs
---
January is a 60 day month of course, but once thats over february is short.  The weather turns a little better in march, april, easter time (eggs are in the shops already). May and june, weathers feeling nice now.  July, were there guys.  
---
Not gonna lie, this gave me a chill up the spine.
---
Remembering every edge-of-your-seat pull in Stratholme - the Hunter edging forward, eyeing his prey, waiting until that perfect moment to shoot; my finger hovering over *Shackle*, and mentally preparing for the shit to hit the fan
---
Goddamn i'm ready for more of that
---
I suck at Index and Match, I shamefully admit.  
---
yes. When I first stepped foot into Darkshore, I hated it. Almost all bears are rabid, corrupt things here and there.
---
Once I entered Ashenvale, it felt much better. And... the XP was much better too XÐ
---
Then, I went to Darkshire if I remember correctly. And leveled all the way til 60. Then 70. Then 80, 85, 90, 100, 110, 120...
---
Darkshore feels so awesome and epic now.
---
yes, though the third quest in the chain clarified that "Killing the bests of Nature is a necessary evil for all who share the land"
---
That's sad
---
may Elune light your path.
---
I'm going to be building one a bit less powerful than yours. I'm pretty excited. I know my current PC could run Classic but I don't care lol, I want a fresh new PC.  
---
So you are saying that launchissues  like queue's, crashes, downtime won't cause complaints? All players i've spoken to alteast want a smooth launch, not another shitshow as we don't have time anymore like 14 years ago to wait in queue's. 
---
&gt;Farming a dungeon during levelling is nearly never worth it because you'll just replace it within a few levels. 
---
This is just completely not true.
---
What can I do for you? Do you require a hearthstone?
---
* clicks the quest *
---
Heroes must keep their strengths up, and spirits high. For to neglect the peace of body and mind, is a sure path to failure.
---
So... rest.
---
* decides to log out for now *
---
Exactly what Madscientist916 said
---
You make it sound really good, but I think I'm going to save &lt;Empty Slot&gt; for my alt class and play something else as my main. I think my guild will have plenty of room for &lt;Empty Slots&gt; on alt-eligible farm runs.
---
Yeah I think legion was great for what it was.  There was a good amount of content, PVE was fun and accessible.  PVP was kind of fucked up but it wasn’t too bad.  But the thing that separates later WoW from classic (and TBC/WotLK to an extent) was that the journey to max level was a huge part of the game.  The later expansions have you leveling up through the content so quickly that it’s forgotten about just as quickly.
---
I also agree slightly with your stance on BFA hate being hyped up but I think there’s more to it then just the hype.  The global Cooldown change will go down as one of the worst changes ever made imo.  And pruning abilities is not fun either, I’ve read about people feeling weaker at max level in BFA than they did 10 levels prior.  I also have read that PvP is beyond messed up.  
---
But again, this is what I’ve read, I haven’t played BFA so I won’t say for certain what is wrong with it and what isn’t but it’s hard to ignore how universally hated it is.  The WoW subreddit has a post everyday about how people who have been playing since vanilla or TBC without ever stopping are unsubbing because of how disappointed they are with BFA. 
---
**I got permanently banned on my MAIN account for posting this on the official wow forums long ago because the video references "Cocaine" and "Drug Deals" in Spanish.**
---
That's a really cool video.
---
I think the effects on sharding may be a more precise study for what the classic wow playerbase would like to see.
---
We could see how cancerous anything after WotLK has become due to min/max'ing profits.
---
Your video brings back some fun memories of how "features" can make a game challenging to an impossible point but also cause creative people to try and solve the issue that was never meant to happen.
---
 No changes approved.
---
Clearly truth is clear and absolute, poor souls with brains, begone!
---
thats a bait to not bring too many people
---
No.  Simply that if you strut around in T2 or T3, or even a level 60 on a warhorse, the other players will look at you with awe.  Or if you do dungeon run and you're an absolutely amazing tank or healer, or you play the mage really well and keep the healer hydrated.  Or that Paladin or Druid that solos the boss after a wipe.
---
Players need other players to cheer for, but they also need other players to hate.
---
Jup. Sadly people are often dumb... And if you perform well with talent they don't understand, they fail to acknowledge that.
---
Wait, you mean classes will be buffed and nerfed all the time...? It sounds exactly like vanilla 1.1-1.12 lol
---
You gotta understand what sharding is: an optimized use of servers aka “shards”/cloud servers, that minimizes their number by collapsing the smaller ones.
---
Votekick was implemented in WOTLK when group finder was added. In Classic, you formed groups manually, so the leader just uninvited the person being a jerk.  Then you all hearthed to Orgrimmar to shout "Scholomance group LF tank" for 45 minutes because no group finder, then the healer gtg sry and you disbanded because now it's 11pm and not really worth trying to find a group at this hour so might as well go farm Dreamfoil in Feralas.
---
And the first shoulder slot is usually a level 17-18 grey item, but you still feel excited about it lol
---
Lacerate doesnt exist 1.12. 31 point survival is wyvern sting.
---
You're the one saying it *isn't* broken. 
---
I'm 100% in agreeance with you admitting that Classic doesn't work properly.
---
Fairly good chance they'll be just fine and only want it to be fast because current content is so braindead easy you dont need to take time with it.
---
Problem is Classic servers will no longer have any lee way in regards to their legal status once Blizzard has a version of classic available.
---
Basically the only reason private servers are allowed to operate currently is because Blizzard doesn't offer the same product anymore therefor they have no rights over it. When blizzard finally offers classic they will re-gain full legal control over ALL classic content and be able to shut down any classic private server at anytime with legal force.
---
You will have no option but to play blizzard classic or move on to TBC private servers.
---
I feed on your tears you elitist turd, memes are dreams
---
Yeah. I got a lot of books on Christmas for myself to keep me busy until Classic launches, but then it is pretty much Classic all the time, boyz!
---
I'm kinda torn between mage and warlock. I had a lock from BC (when I started) till Cata (when I quit for good) and loved it, but the QoL spells of the mage is very appealing to me knowing how things are/will be in classic (food &amp; teleports for instance) + it being supposedly pretty strong as frost specced both in pve and pvp.
---
The thing is, everyone says mage is crazy boring spamming 1-2 spells. I mainly plan to do pve, would love to do raids later on, and lock just seems more interesting to play. Besides the souls shards taking up alot of space in the inventory which is mandatory, nothing else really driving me away from it (okay maybe being the hs vending machine seems pretty painful in raids, but I suppose I'm not supposed to make 39 of them after every wipe).
---
Question is:
---
\*Is mage really that boring to play? 
---
\*Is lock not that much? 
---
\*How occupied these classes are in an average boss fight? I have no problem with cc'ing or doing whatever kind of support instead of damaging, I'm not aiming for the top of the chart, just wanting a meaningful role that takes effort.
---
Also, do we know yet how many debuff slots will bosses have? 8 or 16?
---
Thanks in advance
---
time to chat with your guild, or the guy you were questing an hour ago... while see others travel on the same path as you as well. Welcome to a huge alive immersive virtual world, welcome to old azeroth.
---
yeah, i get it now. 
---
i saw it in the larger sense, i.e. one side is hopelessly trying to enforce their regime by invading a peaceful country, which doesn't quite represent the clash the horde &amp; alliance have there by chance of both being present
---
&gt;All players i've spoken to alteast want a smooth launch, not another shitshow as we don't have time anymore like 14 years ago to wait in queue's,
---
Don't play the first week then? 
---
&gt;Might be me, but i'm getting more and more the feeling you weren't even there 14 years to witness the shitshow that was Vanilla Launch.
---
I actually wasn't. But do I want to see it? Yes. Did I go through queues when Blackrock was full? Yes. Did I see the AQ40 event? Yes. All the lag and crashes were fine with thr AQ40 event because it was worth it.
---
Wait... " Procs proccing procs, leading TF to be a one-shot wunderwaffe with the right gear. "
---
Is this not how Windfury works...? In Vanilla I mean. Surely it's going to work like that in Classic too?
---
You are weird.
---
Eh...
---
My hunter had a pole arm that would proc fire damage. You could spam wingclip and raptor strike and do a surprising amount of damage. Hardly going to work as just melee but it was a potent defense!
---
Agreed on the time. I myself don't believe it, but showing you are fine with Christmas release is kinda negative vibes to Blizzard if they check the subreddit rather than hype for July 16th... Let's hope, then.
---
\&gt;Finally we all know that salty feeling when someone who did 200DPS rolls a BiS item while people who did 800DPS don't get anything in reward
---
But then, what if this player doing 800 dps is a meme spec ?
---
But sometimes oomkins and retadins are &lt;Empty raid slots&gt;
---
Dude I hope it’s June, sooner the better
---
Well... good luck I guess.
---

Devs are not free you know. They have to implement the stuff that comes from above - stuff like loot trading, because there aren’t gonna be any gms left by summer - and then they have to convince themselves that the game wont hurt from it, although it will. Hell - it will even be a begger product without gms! A similar process - powerlessness mixed with personal identification with a company - will convince some players/fanboys that it wont hurt the game, although it will.
---
That is exactly what happened in the demo fool.
---
So I asked "Would you join a UBRS run with Group Loot and Loot Trading?" and your answer "If I trusted the player who was master looter I would"...
---
I hear that about dropping locks for min/maxing all the time, but what's the reasoning?
---
Lock dps is infinitely easier to manage than  mage ignite dps and warlocks have a higher threat ceiling than melee inherently by not being in melee range of the boss. This feels especially true late in Naxx when locks get 6 piece t3. 
---
Warlocks like mages are extremely easy to gear quickly compared to melee. A bloodvine prebis lock has much better damage potential than a comparable fury just on the basis of them being so weapon dependent. (even for as good as Dalaran's are for melee pre-raid)
---
Why prioritize other DPS?
---
If you try to join a raiding guild that turns you away after mentioning a spec, that's a problem. If you have people insult you and disrespect you because of your spec, that's a problem. If people say gear should be given to you last once no one else needs it because of your spec, that's a problem.
---
IMO you overestimate actiblizz in respecting players wants for classic. They will put a cash shop for realm transfers - because that’s the most convenient place to put it. Do I have to explain what happens next. 
---
Aye. Minority faction on a pve server is the easy life, PROVIDED there is an active enough population that putting groups and raids together isn't impossible.
---
The last good fresh servers before Classic WoW,so I highly recommend to play on it.
---
Did you play with A Team
---
Or more generally stated, pick a server whose peak time matches your playtime (generally 7p-11p or midnight server time).

I was a night elf male warrior in Vanilla, and while I regret it for aesthetic purposes, I did not realize how much help Shadowmeld was for emergency afks. I leveled a human warrior recently and I would come back from an afk dead about 90% of the time. Shadowmeld is very valuable for the casual dad/mom. I do think human will suit you better at max level, however.
---
This is categorically wrong.
---
I had the same experience as you. I thought that surely the quest guide had made a mistake, why should i be in this god forsaken land? I could see no end to the ganking... 
---
Few hours pass by and im steamrolling horde players with the only 4 other alliance players in the flat, ending up with 140 HK in an evening, was hella great.
---
That's vanilla. Vanilla isn't splitting that server up into groups so what you group up with completely random players without any control of your own. You can increase the spawn rate of the messenger to 1 second if you so need players to complete that quest, but sharding them away from each other ruins the reason why this is a great game. 
---
Fuck sharding. 
---
Thanks for being so specific. My testing on deadmines have led me to postponing it to lvl 20 or 21, and demanding a 20+ group. This will reduce the risk and speed up the run. It didn’t slow me down more than a little, as a mage.
---
But then again, I need the SW rep rewards, and the quest reward and possible drops are pretty neat. I did, however, waste time on BFD (will definitely skip) and Dun Modr. Stockades are fine too though. Probably wont be doing gnomie - will you?
---
Let's be honest. Classic is Blizzard's last breath. They take it or leave it. If Activision cucks step on them, they have to retaliate or else they will all die, together with the piece of shit parental company. 
---
This same statement is posted here daily.
---
The is the first option I stated.... . No loot trading and just closing tickets with an auto message that deals with loot
---
Woahh, TIL fear can be stopped with a Curse of Recklessness. Oh and I just learnt that mobs that run away in fear will run in opposite direction they're facing... No more chain pulls for me! Just when you think you know all you can about vanilla.
---
You'd be shocked by how many minor details are missed on private servers. Although the grand scheme is similar, they are not authentic Vanilla. 
---
World bosses were tethered in patch 1.12 iirc.
---
Mini-bosses were still kitable. Things like Teremus the Devourer from Blasted lands.
---
With the point being gutting gameplay is ok if it means ensuring financial success of the game?
---
You aren't considering the potential leveling speed you get from the blues from the dungeon though. Some items from Wailing Caverns I've kept up until my mid 30's. 
---
So although running the dungeon past the first time won't be very beneficial, if you aren't planning on being World first, I'd say the advantage for a casual leveler is a big plus. 
---
The amount of money they'd save by sharding is negligible (which is they still don't shard most zones in current retail RP realms), it would actually LOSE them money in classic considering how many people would quit if they implemented long term sharding
---
Level 15 grey shoulders are legit the most hyped you'll ever be for a loot drop in all of classic. 
---
It's a truly amazing experience, next to how great it is to get a helmet, neck piece, and then a ring that has your actual class stats.  
---
Hey buddy, this may be a long shot but you should contact them one last time and point out that even more recent bot bans have only lasted 6months to a year and that you've been banned for more than 10 years.
---
Yupp!
---
[Heres a link to my old post describing exactly this problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8k5tw0/i_thought_i_did_but_i_didnt/). I found that the magic was mostly in the unknowns and now that everything is known and optimized there is no room for discovery or experimentation that used to happen.
---
&gt; Stockades are fine too though. Probably wont be doing gnomie - will you?
---
Likely skipping Gnomer, it's fairly trash. There's tons of xp quests, but you have to do gnomer.
---
The Stockade is great. 14K quest xp, with quest givers and turn in reasonably close, and a densely packed quick dungeon? It'll likely get a favorable nod, even with shit drops.
---
Not when the dungeons have been out for 14 years. 
---
Sharding for the first 30 days, and then literally never again, is fine. 
---
This is why you roll a crafter, so you can grind that shiz up to the point of crafting that elusive white helm or shoulder item so you can be the envy of your friends. You can craft them for your friends too! 
---
You keep regenerating while in combat while you drink. 
---
Every caster will know what it means to spam press the drink button once he has killed Rajaxx and wants to drink between waves. 
---
That but less spammy is applied in dungeons. Fight ends, casters sit down to drink, tank pulls and fights where casters may get in combat due to the vicinity but dont get harmed by spells which interrupt the drinking.
---
There are also quest rewards of pretty good 1h/2h weaps that you might be able to utilise.  There's one in Redridge you mention for killing that group of elites, really good 2h if I remember correctly.  Early on in a server, you will definitely be able to find help for that quest.  The quest goes yellow at like, level 25 or something if I remember correctly but obtainable WAY before. 
---
Quest reward 1h or 2h weapons from dungeons are totally sick though.  I think the difference in kill speed is way better than 10% or so, depending on how low level you are when you get it.  Even the crescent staff from wailing caverns is really nice DPS, and stam/spirit.. Good warrior stats!
---
There have got to be other really good, early obtainable quests in the open world for weaps as well.  Having top-quality weapons will definitely help your kill speed and help you avoid deaths as well.. Plus probably make it more fun.  Is fun an objective?
---
Nothing except nonstop posts, day after day, explaining the well-trodden points of what the community hopes to avoid?  What else can be accomplished in the brave halls of a subreddit?
---
If meme specs was actually good no one would complain. I mean there is a reason people talk about ret palas all the time and not feral druids...
---
If you're indeed rushing, you'll need to consider that you might have a hard time finding other rushers of equal level interested in running instances.
---
And if you're ahead of the pack, because you have an ungodly strategy for fast leveling, there might not even be any players at your level at that time. Meaning you would have to wait for them to catch up.
---
Imo, skip dungeons. You can always do it slower with dungeon runs on an alt.
---
Right. I’ve played since release and knew all that. The conversation at hand was a dude chilling in the dungeon still and, by how it was said, apparently preventing from adding another person. That’s what was trying to be figured out.
---
The moral aspect is pretty fresh.
---
The EU or swiss court ruled that Current Wow is a different game than Classic wow and if blizzard no longer offers the classic wow content then the rights to that content fall on the player that purchased it. Classic servers are only legaly hosted in some countries and you are only allowed to play on them if you already own a copy of vanilla wow.
---
The whole point of making classic wow was so blizzard could re-gain full control over all parts of their IP, shut down all private servers and force people back into their subscription model. Its funny that people think Blizzard is making classic out of the kindness of their heart.
---
&gt;You  bring up some fair and good points, but please also note that the vanilla wow servers were individual blades in a chasis.  Blades are cool and all for keeping costs low but they weren't clustered, they weren't utilizing top of the line hardware, and their software wasn't as optimized.  Back then we still had 32 bit servers with a max of 4GB RAM.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Now we can have physical server clusters managing a single 'server', we can have easily 256GB RAM per server, more CPUs than we know what to do with, and can 'auto scale' with cloud servers if needed.  
---
&gt;With all that said, I expect the opening to be a complete shit show like the original was for the reasons you mentioned.
---
No it's literally not, that would ruin the entire fresh server experience. I would much rather have 10 fps and fight over every mob than only have 10 people in a zone.
---
I generally tolerate the newest WOW expansions but that last one is the most lame thing for sure. "Champion, come over here!"....ugh..like let me live! 
---
My concern isn't that the hardware can't handle the load - my concern is that the zones simply don't have the capacity.  
---
This topic is starting to overwhelm the sharding posts
---
Eh, My bad.  I probably would not go to UBRS with 9 strangers for group loot.  
---
How high is the pop?
---
Fair point but I’m hoping just the damn spawns are fast. It SUCKED waiting for the god damn rabbit to spawn so you could kill it and get lvl5 from your quest. If they can fix spawns I’ll be pretty happy. How about you?
---
Yeah for the Mallet at Zul Farrak if I remember correctly.  Also one going to Booty bay and back a whole bunch.  
---
Sometimes it's worth it to get the "back and forth" quests- easy XP each time you happen to be there.  Just don't make a trip unless you have to, abandon if it gets grey or if you need the sapce. 
---
We have a different understanding of the game it seems
---
I think the OP is saying that the pservers will have a official Blizzard 1.12 client to take data from to improve upon the pserver accuracy.
---
&gt;then see how many stacks of sunder I can get up before the mobs die
---
One tip I can give when tanking multiple mobs is to figure out at what point you can safely switch away from the primary target. No point in spending rage on a mob that's below a certain level of HP. Start getting more threat on the next target up; best case you'll already have enough threat that the first mob stays on you until it dies, worst case you loose aggro right before it dies and it hits a melee once.
---
Petpo Row    (switch the Ps and Rs)
---
That is a lie. Loot trading existed in all of classic. You had to open a gm ticket and both players had to agree to the change and the item would be traded.
---
1) It's melodramatic to say that they're *gutting gameplay*, so I disagree with that premise.
---
2) To quote from the post: 
---
&gt; “Without these cost control measures, Blizzard might only run the Classic realms so long as there are enough people playing to offset the operational expenditures (assuming they'd greenlight it at all!). That means we'd be right back where we are with private servers, which is uncertain about the long term future of our time investment.”
---
You don't, though. People roll need and "oops, missclick lol" and you lose your item. With trading, you just open trade and either get your item or you know that it was 100% intentional.
---
Not only that, but most of the fastest rushers will be DPS classes. So those players well ahead of the curve won't just have a small pool of people to run dungeons with, they'll have a tiny pool of tanks and not much better for healers. 
---
Oh, if that's his point then yes! He's 100% true, Blizzard needs to get fucked if they try and swindle loyal customers. 
---
I agree.  But *that* part at least reminds me of the vanilla experience lol.
---
I don't want dynamic respawns.  I think that breaks the immersion.  But a slight acceleration, at least temporarily, may be a possible solution.
---
I dunno, I'm not too butthurt about the whole situation.  Given the circumstances, it's going to be impossible for the Classic release to re-create the Vanilla release - so I've made peace with the fact that the first couple weeks will be a modern day experience.
---
OP is saying that after they release classic p servers will have access to the accurate data
---
Yikes...  
---
Anyway, Blizzard will enforce their copyright and trademarks in all jurisdictions where they are able. Unless the server is making some sort of profit, this usually will entail a simple cease and desist letter. They don't have to release official Classic servers to "re-gain full control over all parts of their IP"--they already control all parts of it. They shut them down to protect their IP.  
---
Or, as J. Allen Brack said:  
---
"Why not just let Nostalrius continue the way it was? The honest answer is, failure to protect against intellectual property infringement would damage Blizzard’s rights. This applies to anything that uses WoW’s IP, including unofficial servers. And while we’ve looked into the possibility – there is not a clear legal path to protect Blizzard’s IP and grant an operating license to a pirate server."
---
The same occurred in classic. I know a warrior who was pretty geared but if he was talking for a pug he would roll need on crappy blue 2 handlers "lol need for my dps set" just so he could vendor them after the run. You never knew it happened, but it did.
---
This is where I come in, knight in shining armor, to help you poor low levels out in your predicament. Of course, being ret, Deadmines is about as much progress as I'll ever see.
---
The server is not out yet. It's launching, tomorrow at 19:00 CET.
---
Defensive dispel is a HUGE bonus to battlegrounds or small group PVP.  You are effectively nullifying significant CDs of the other team by an instant cast, ~100 mana, no cooldown ability of your own.  Or at least, very important CCs that can be broken easily. 
---
Blind?  dispel
---
Polymorph?  Dispel, over and over again!
---
Fear?  dispel (only warlock fear is dispellable, priest/warrior is not)
---
Seduce?  Dispel.  Repeatedly.  
---
Silence? Counterspell?  Dispel them both!
---
Cripp poison?  Dispel
---
Mind control?  Can't dispel unfortunately... if it's someone on your faction, they turn red, so dispel doesn't work =P.  
---
Can also dispel important DOTs (corruption, siphon life, ignite dot, SWP, etc) to provide extra heals as well
---
I dispel allllll the time.  Sometimes it's more important to dispel than to heal.  It's extremely important to any situation. 
---
&gt;Of course Cookie's wand would probably be nice to have for you
---
And even in this case, a Greater Magic Wand should easily last you until you can grab the quest wand from BFD.
---
&gt; Is fun an objective?
---
My fun starts at 60.
---
And I agree there are tons of great quest rewards for weapons, its one of the reasons I'm making this. At level ~18 I can get that elite quest in redridge for an 18.2dps mace - or TRY to get the 19.7 Smite's hammer in The Deadmines.
---
So The Deadmines section will have a comparison of easily attainable options. [Orc Crusher](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6093) should be about on par with Smite's hammer, BUT it comes with 2,550xp and is guaranteed reward.
---
&gt;I think the difference in kill speed is way better than 10% or so, depending on how low level you are when you get it.
---
I may need to rephrase that. It's not particularly 10% faster killing that I'm looking at, it's 10% faster leveling. A good weapon can decrease kill time, and give 30% more kills per hour, but normalized with recovery and travel, it might only be 10% more xp per hour.
---
Paladins get Verigan's fist at about 20 which is an Astounding weapon. Demolishes mobs 20-25. But it takes 2-3 hours to get with minimal XP gained. My math and testing have normal quest rewards getting from 20-30 in about 13 hours. Verigan's fist starts out about 2 hours behind, but then gets to 30 in 11 hours. So it's about a wash to that point, with Verigan's having an edge 30-34 until Bonebiter.
---
Lol okay. I don't think "work" means what you think it does, but at this point I'll let you research and figure it out for yourself. 
---
It's all relative though? 10g is to 10000g what 1000g is to 1000000g.
---
Both examples are just some...numbers. Are numbers stupid?
---
Forgot fear 
---
That was always pretty last ditch.... I didn’t use that unless I absolutely needed to.
---
I think we have a big problem in the community. People praising woltk and classic at the same time. Woltk was casual and classic was more for the people with time. Tbc tried to find a good midway and cata tried to do the same. But cata got tons of hate. And they abandoned the old ways. Since woltk was loved and cata not. 
---
Legion was a good start tho 
---
Private servers have the moral high ground anyway since they're not charging 15 dollars a month to play a 15 years old game with next to no development costs.
---
Purple is fear
---
&gt;Random player falls off and pulls a shit ton of whelps in UBRS
---
*Gets knocked back from orcs on top level right off the edge*
---
"Idk what happened bro!"
---
Fear is pretty strong Since The mob Will always run away from The one fearing it. Used it alot when i played private servers
---
Until it runs into more trash and wipes your group.. in my experience with vanilla the mop ran willy nilly.
---
Here's a great resource I found that lists out efficient weapon progression for warriors from 1-60: https://youtu.be/gtxX1WQILnM?t=1312.
---
Even if a dungeon ends up being efficient with the raw data you are looking at, there are also variables such as getting a group within your level range (SM quest @34 is extremely unlikely) as a speed leveler. The other players around your level - assuming you are ahead of the curve - may not be trying to run dungeons. There will also be plenty of PVP action at every dungeon within contested areas. 
---
Ew you slap star? That's disgusting 
---
That's the common setup for the whole time I played classic and BC
---
They dont :D good luck when classic hits :D
---
heres hoping blizzard survives until then :/
---
So much of the end game is PvP. Fighting over resources, world buffs, world bosses.
---
Definitely a neutered experience to play PvE. Obviously personal preference is what matters, but a few hours of grief doesn't seem worth throwing away the majority of what made vanilla good. I imagine more players being disappointed they rolled PvE. 
---
Atop the north western peak, surrounded by Orcs.
---
&gt; with next to no development costs
---
This particular section feels very incorrect.
---
Haha! Real friendships have been forged while auto-run was active back in vanilla. 
---
Demo looks like shit tbh, a complete different game with a new client, not looking good !
---
Pservers will be the closest we get to a authentic vanilla experience.
---
There you said it:WEEKS
---
Fuck that, if they have the sharding option they ARE GOING TO FIND EXCUSES TO USE IT.
---
Okay. Sounds like a bad idea, but you wipe your raids. I’ll keep spamming /oom as you wipe us :) 
---
You're making a mountain out of a molehill.  They're not going to be sharding STV or something.  They'll be sharding the starting zones.  Maybe stuff like Elwynn and Westfall.  But by the time you reach places like Redridge, etc., there won't be any need.
---
Keep watching tips out and other shit youtubers who never actually played the game
---
Probably why I don’t end up wiping in dungeons. 
---
I wish it had ended up being a winter release.  The 3 whole months of summer that i get i want to be out fishing, etc.
---
I'd rather be grinding away now when the weather is shit :(
---
It won’t make much difference. The database values at this point are very very close to vanilla. 95% of the current PS discrepancies are scripting problems that the release of classic won’t at all help with.
---
It would be more common if anything, since it's less obvious, more people will be inclined to abuse loot trading.
---
Why does everyone hate loot trading? I thought back when it was originally implemented, classes that could actually wear the item could roll Need and you could only loot trade items you won via Greed.
---
Is that not the case?
---
You can't need something and give it to your buddy with that system, even if they could wear it. You can only trade loot won via greed.
---
&gt; Not only that, but most of the fastest rushers will be DPS classes. So those players well ahead of the curve won't just have a small pool of people to run dungeons with, they'll have a tiny pool of tanks and not much better for healers.
---
Running a paladin, so at best, I'll still be behind some DPS. I still expect to be well ahead with the big guys tho, and being a healer has benefits in getting into dungeons a tad lower than the rest.
---
Some specs aren't designed for raiding.  That doesn't mean the spec doesn't have use.
---
Trying to make every spec viable everywhere is how you get some of the most overpowered specs, because you take something that works in PvP and give it buffs to make it stronger in PvE, and now you have something that is even stronger.
---
Or you give it buffs in PvE and nerfs in PvP, and now you can raid on any spec but the PvP suffers.
---
Or you can PvE and PvP in all specs, but only because they all bleed into each other and feel the same.  (The exception here is hybrids, of course).
---
And you mention some problems.  Who is the problem here?  Is it the game?  No.  The game gives your class the means to be effective in a raid.  If you choose not to use those means, that's on you for making that choice.
---
If a guild turns you away, is it because the game is badly designed?  No.  It may be justified for the reason above, or it may be that the guild hasn't seen you in action with your spec.  If you play that spec well enough that a guild should accept you, then a guild will accept you.  Maybe not the first one you apply for, but you will find a guild.
---
People put too much responsibility on the game to allow them to do everything.  A little bit of that responsibility falls back on the player.  That becomes a personal decision to make, and a community decision regarding whether to accept you with the decisions you've made.  
---
If you have a spec that's useless everywhere, that's a problem.  Ret is good for leveling and PvP.  Boomkin is okay in PvP, and Restokin is a viable healing build.  I'm a bit fuzzier on elemental but I imagine frost shock and earth shock are quite powerful in PvP.  BM hunters scale horribly, but are considered the best class for leveling and top 1 or 2 classes for farming at 60 (the other being a mage).
---
The specs are viable.  They may not be viable in the corner of the game you're playing, but they ARE viable.
---
That’s nice. When you front the 10 million cash to make Classic you can make it exactly the way you want too.
---
That's nice. Only allows the "crap I needed that." &amp; only affects you when everyone else greeds.
---
I remember a guy named Totemtank that did tank some raids. I saw his gear and it was really cool seeing someone do something they love with a guild backing them. I believe he didn't tank past ZG however...
---
"Almost..."
---
I believe that if you want to rush to 60 and you plan on playing from day 1, then leveling through dungeons will be the fastest way. Yes gnomer and uldaman are a pain in the ass, but it will be faster than having to compete for mobs. If Classic server population will be anything close to pserver population then competing for mobs is going to be hell. 
---
I have leveled in pservers and competing for raptors, murlocs, crocs, and hoggers in dustwallow marsh was a huge pain and felt like days to gather the resources to turn in for quests. 
---
But I like your breakdown and I am interested in more!!
---
Verigan's requires like... 3 or 4 different dungeon runs, good luck doing that in 2-3 hours!  
---
How do you know that? What difference does it make if 2000 people are in the orc starting area and 2000 people in STV? Both would geta sharding cause servers cant handle so many people doing quests and pvp.
---
I'm sure being level 2 for several hours is "fun"
---
TBC got rid of the notion of shaman tanking. Vanilla retained rockbiter and earth shock threat. The final nail in the coffin though was when they removed extra threat from frost shock (they moved the +threat over to this) and their parry reduced their threat... :(
---
I'm going to push even further and play as a Horde on a RP-PvE server. I suspect H:A ratio to be like 20:80 xD We'll see how it goes.
---
Rockbiter was retained throughout vanilla but i do not believe it was always in it's original form by the end.
---
yes having things readable is important
---
Recall math from grade school - always bring terms to lowest form with factoring, their is no reason to have something cost 100 when it can cost 10. aesthetics are important in designing good Loops
---
Gnomer is not as difficult as people claim it's just that people constantly try to run it when they are too low. 
---
You can get the quests at level 26 but the final boss is level 34 so nobody below level 30 has any business being in there. 
---
Gather a group of people 30-34 and you will breeze through it in a little over an hour. 
---
Because you won't have 2,000 people in STV.
---
Just calm your tits and think through this reasonably.  Blizzard knows that there's going to be a tremendous infusion of tourists when Classic launches.  A lot of people that never played Classic, but are curious about it, will flood the servers.  The majority of them, IMO, are going to quickly realize that it's not their cup of tea.
---
Now, keep in mind that it takes about 24 hours /played to get to level 20 or so - especially for people that aren't aggressively leveling.  It's likely around that same level that the majority of the "Not For Me" people will have bailed already.  So by the time you're getting into the 20's and 30's zones, the player numbers will have dropped precipitously just because of the outgoing tourists.
---
Now also consider that people will be leveling at different paces.  You've got the bleeding edge folks.  They're going to quickly outpace everyone else.  Then you've got the aggressive levelers.  Then the more moderate people.  Then the people that are smelling the roses and taking their time.  Then the people that will get about 15-20 levels in and decide "Eh, I'm gonna switch classes."  The end result is that you're going to get a natural metering of the player base.  The concentration that you saw in the starting zones isn't going to still exist by the time you get to 20+.
---
In other words, there will be no reason to shard beyond the first few weeks and/or starting/early zones.  Blizzard knows how the players feel about sharding.  They're not gonna use it more than they have to do so.  There's no gain or advantage in it for them.
---
I'm honestly curious how you think vanilla raiding works.
---
For example bat or snake trash in ZG. Nobody needs caster to spam AoE when the melees just cleave everything down. 
---
I do not speak about healers as I stated. Just about mages specifically. Warlock just life tap and are full mana always anyways after fights, but nobody needs all mages at all fights.
---
If you need them for stuff like sheeping axe throwers, you wont just run in without checking caster mana, but you dont need the casters on the fight 100% of the time.
---
Sharding is fine as long as it gets shut off eventually(at a certain level hopefully). Loot Trading is a big nothing burger.  If people engage in it and are caught then they'll get blacklisted by the community same as we did with ninja looters back in the day.  No biggy.
---
I cannot agree more, we do not need a shit software, we need the core mechanics in the best software we can get.
---
This nostalgia is bullcrap. Vanilla has serious mistakes, BC was perfect. Blizz screw up the game into bad mechanics and we want the old game, not the old software.
---
Original Mortal strike, original pvp unbalanced for 1x1 and arena, original dungeons with difficulty and group cooperation. Ofc summon stones are welcome, anti cheat, anti bot,  old talent trees (with corrections).
---
The game value is in its design and core, not into the software technology.
---
The talents are there but not many chose that path and instead went for 2h windfury, which was awesome in its own right. Nothing funnier than seeing someone try to summon people at SM with a warlock only for a shaman to lumber over and oneshot the warlock. I explored shaman tanking myself and it works. It's an avoidance based tank sorta like a druid but the armor and hp are lacking. With non-raid gear, I had about 33% dodge with agi totem, 5k armor, and 4.2k hp. I dont recall parry or block but it was probably about 5% parry and 10% block. Shamans can definitely push out threat but survivability is the problem since it's impossible to reach def cap. I used eye of the storm procs to help with AoE threat besides the constant tab auto swings and earth shocks.
---
I bought BFA after not playing since wotlk. Immediately boosted a Pandaren Monk to 110 and was worshiped as a legendary hero of the alliance. 
---
I had literally done nothing...
---
We made it boys!
---
Thanks a lot
---
The first half of this year is going to Kick ass. Between Avengers Endgame, GoT and WoW. Once April hits its going to fly by!
---
True, but I'm very optimistic at the moment. 
---
If you think AQ and Naxx progression is not going to be work, then it’s probably not gonna be something you experience. 
---
 Instead of: hearthstone ready every 5 minutes
---
Say: Die and respawn near town's graveyard in order to avoid using Heartstone because you will need it 10 minutes after that.
---
It is 20 , but it's not all together if that makes sense. I will get 20 mins, Then not play for 45 mins - hour then get another half hour. On a weekday or something. etc etc. 
---
However it is true at weekends i have plenty of free time (Mrs is at work and i'm not so..... lol)
---
I don't know about that one chief. You can't do any Naxx without the full team. and Progression raiding is about the same. 
---
I think that they plan on releasing classic early june-july but they just said "summer" in case they need extra time they can extend their release date without people getting angry

If you are running as a paladin, i suggest you do the quest for the 2H mace that you get around level 18 (might a lil bit before and a lil bit after im not sure) it's a very good weapon that gets replaced at around level 40-45 and since you will be 18 by the time you get the quest, i'm pretty sure you wil lfind a lot of people rushing like you (before they give up) and usually, from what i remember in live and what i saw on private server, paladins are looking for other paladin to do the quest so you all get your mace together.
---
hope this helps
---
Wtf that comment start, little kiddo? Ok.
---
STV is a huge area and 2k people is totally possible even weeks after launch. Lots of 60s, then everything from lvl 30 to lvl 46.
---
For me even the option of sharding makes me afraid that I will not see my whole server population around me.
---
I see lots of reasons to shard if sharding is in the client: BIG world pvp clashs, city raids... mainly world pvp or rp things with lots of peopele from tehe same server involved.
---
Roll as a female dwarf priest with pigtails because when she casts spells her pigtails twirl around in the air.
---
Here is a video: https://youtu.be/9P-o9FGn67s
---
Just fast forward to when she is casting spells and you will see her pigtails twirl around like crazy. :)
---
So where is the problem here?
---

I don't know what to tell you.  You're wrong.
---
Hi, /u/Pazool24
---
&gt; Do servers still have queues, or has hardware advanced enough to avoid that?
---
Sometimes.  It's rare though.  There were fairly long queues at Legion launch for certain servers.
---
lol.
---
Running LBRS with a guild group, my mage's pre-raid BIS drops. Healer needs (they were confused for their pre-raid BIS). Accidental ninja, or misunderstanding? Or how about it's 2 am, melee dps gear drops, the tank thought the rogue greeded so he needed for offspec.  
---
I don't know what made you so jaded to assume there's going to be cartels conspiring to prevent you getting any loot, but it's hilarious that this sub spouts "in vanilla you have a server reputation" and "everyone's an anonymous ninja"
---
Can confirm ice trap as played vanilla hunter.
---
The advantage is this will likely get classic players to play retail
---
You haven't explored either based on your statements here. Lightning shield is only good for the initial pull due to high mana cost. You forgot to even mention rockbiter and the totems. Also, the totem that "taunts" has very low hp, doesn't give the shaman any threat, and won't pull anything off anyone unless very little threat was generated by them. Chain lightning for group pulls and lightning bolt for single. With paladins, you don't even mention blessings/seals/judgments/auras. Max ranks generate more threat. Only rank 1 holy shield if you just want to mitigate instead of build threat. You have to actually think and plan to play these classes this way, and your description shows me you've done neither.
---
I'm totally down with this level of theory crafting but the fundamental flaw is that there are too many outside variables you can't account for. 
---
Dungeons can be a nice break from the open world if it's really crowded and you find yourself competing for mobs and quests. 
---
Also a run could go smooth and take 30 minutes or someone can be a total newb and wipe your group and then people start leaving and you never even finish.
---
Same with drops, you might the lucky recipient of a smite hammer your first run which lasts you all the way till your high 20s and makes the run totally worth it. 
---
I personally like to speed level but not at all costs, I usually run each dungeon at least once to break the monotony of questing/grinding if nothing else. 
---
I thought that this predictability of a fleeing mobs direction only existed on p-servers. On real vanilla, a feared mob would really take off in a random direction. Please correct me if I’m wrong though.
---
It's weird, I saw ninja looting maybe 10 times the entire time I played Vanilla.  The person went onto my ignore list and the next time I ended up in a group with them, I let everyone know he's a ninja looter and soon he wasn't in the group.
---
Yup, people in 2019 will already have access to Classic because they pay $15 for retail, and Classic will be right there are the Bnet launcher for easy installation. You are correct that this increases the amount of people who will check it out at release but have no real investment in that iteration of the game. 
---
Another factor is that every streamer and their brother has said they are going to be streaming Classic at release. Even guys that mostly play shooters, like Summit1g, have said they're going to be streaming Classic. This further increases the chance for tourists at release, because all of the sycophantic fanboys are going to want to try the game their favorite steamer is playing, and possibly play on his server to interact with him. If a huge streamer like Ninja decides to stream Classic (he has recently streamed FF11), we are in for a complete mess of kids wanting to check out the game. 
---
When the only barrier for entry is $15, and millions of retail players are already paying that $15, the number of tourists Classic WoW might get is absolutely immense. 
---
There is wide consensus on Nightfall being a top tier raid DPS increasing debuff.  This is proven through theorycrafting as well as practical experimentation by Keftenk on a private server.  If you want me to explain it I am willing, but you have to be receptive to the concept.
---
That's still not even true because it's much more beneficial to just have an off tank use one and just bring another actual dps.
---
If you skip deadmines, that means that you won't get the long follow-up questline in SW that takes you through Stocks and beyond. You end up cutting off a lot of SW-related quest content, including some thousands of XP for doing nothing more than walking across the city.
---
Similarly for Ulda, if you skip it you miss a ton easy experience later in Tanaris for the follow-ups to the platinum disk quests.
---
Hey guys... what’s your overall thought on rogue mace/sword PvP builds? It seems dagger is superior but I’m JW your .02!
---
Welcome to our humble altar of Vanilla-appreciation that is this forum! I hope you will find peace and enjoyment, come summer of '19.
---
It involves the 1st boss in Deadmines, like 5 minutes into SFK, and mobs around the entrance of BFD. If you're running with a few other paladins, it's quick.
---
And if it takes more than a few hours, it's not worth it at all if you're trying to go quick.
---
This is perfect. You clear MC and BWL when your GF is at work. You need like evening for raiding, that's it.
---
Pugs on private Server do this.
---
And when you have 20 or 45 mins during the week, you hop on your horse and farm mats for raiding or do a quick dungeon.
---
I mean unless you plan on clearing BRD in one go, that's where you need like a whole day.
---
But pls, don't join a casual guild, like someone already said, they don't clear BWL and MC in one sitting and the people get bored without progress. There is just too much fluctuation. Just join a Semi Hardcore Raid. And turn up for raids when you have the time:
---
PROFIT!
---
What news 
---
I paid 700g for mine.  Prices tend to vary.
---
Rockbiter still gave extra threat in vanilla. I'm telling this as fact.
---
We have no idea how loot trading is going to work. More then likely it will only be in items greed rolled on 
---
I get what you guys are saying, and I also like the idea of being an Adventurer who is just traveling the world. But let's be real, it would be stupid to *still* just be an Adventurer in retail, after 12 years of slaying powerful foes, saving the world and working alongside our faction's leaders.
---
Lol it's a game design problem.
---
Just hop on that struggle bus.
---
It's a demo that was most likely rushed out to show what progress had been made. And if you expected Classic to use the 1.12 client (not saying this is what you're implying necessarily) then you're delusional.
---
Not released yet on my server. We are working our way through BWL currently.
---
You are enabling those jerks by allowing loot trading.  How do you not realize that?
---
Yeah, if you think anyone at level 30’or higher is going to risk being blacklisted over one or two items people are kidding themselves.
---
Nobody is going to ninja loot any more than vanilla with or without loot trading.
---
&gt;yes having things readable is important
---
"7000" is perfectly readable for me :)
---
Also, there was a quest "You have served us well", that awarded some "Wizard's hat", which was not only the first item I could war on my head, but also was so epic with the wizard-like look... so epic, that I took a screenshot, and posted it on social media.
---
Social medias weren't any close to what they are today. There was MySpace, though nobody now about it or how to operate it, and there was some local social media website, where you had to register through your school - that's what I, and generally we, used.
---
And... the picture is still there:

---
Your just missing a ton of attack  power for lack of strength, 2 ap per point that scales with HotW and kings.
---
Gonna go ahead and file it under meme spec. 
---
Glad you had fun with it, but I think it's disingenuous to pitch it to newcomers as a viable option. 
---
Initial development of Classic certainly has a cost, but ongoing development costs post release should be near zero. The whole point is moot though as you're paying the sub to get retail access with Classic as a bonus.
---
I'm like not a rusher, but I'm a very efficient person and I like the math and theory behind games.
---
I would be very interested in that list for the Horde side.
---
I would be interested especially in Dungeons like the Sunken Temple, it's a very controversial Dungeon. Maybe you find out that it's actually super efficient to visit it. That would be hilarious.
---
We want to have the attitude of strategizing instead of blaming. Classic will be filled with try hards unless we ease up a little on the "requirements"
---
I'm with you
---
&gt; I believe that if you want to rush to 60 and you plan on playing from day 1, then leveling through dungeons will be the fastest way.
---
That's one of the things I want to test. If it's accurate, great, if it's bunk, there's sauce for it.
---
Let's say there's 100 elite mobs in The Stockade. Level 23 average. 165 base XP for a level 23 player, elites so 320. *1.4 for group bonus is 448, /5 for group penalty is 90xp per mob. 9,000xp per run (assuming 100 mobs is accurate) - 30 minute Stocks runs for 18,000xp/hr at level 23 ain't bad. But Stocks is fast, others not so much. We'll have to see.
---
One big thing I'd like to at least have firm answers for is "This dungeon is worth ####XP the first go-through and ####XP thereafter @ X level." so we can figure out if you're right, and if dungeon leveling IS faster.
---
All I could think of was this clip from team America.  https://youtu.be/y2GwrR-4Q9E
---
Indeed!
---
I still think back to that moment looking down. I was in so much awe playing wow back then. 
---
I remember seeing my lvl 50 buddy roll up to elylwynn forest on a mount just being stunned st how bad is he looked and how unimaginable getting that far I  the game was to me 
---
Well I'm not sure a chain of buffs or nerfs is necessarily a bad thing - a lot of the balance of 1.12 doesn't closely resemble the balance of 1.1. For example, prior to 1.4 shaman's windfury could proc off itself, and windfury had DOUBLE the base bonus attack power (latter changed in 1.11). Warriors weren't even a good PvE DPS until 1.6, and it really took the dual wield changes in 1.8 for them to shine. So at least for much of the time when MC was out, an enhancement would outdps a warrior (assuming he didn't pull aggro from chaining multiple windfuries together and die, which is admittedly a big assumption). Compare this to private server logs, where in progression MC, fury warriors are pulling over double the DPS of enhancement shamans, and you have a state of balance which is totally unrecognizable in 1.12 compared to what it was just a year earlier. That's just what Vanilla WoW was - constantly rebalancing. Hell, the rogues didn't get their talent buff until 1.12, the very last patch of the game!
---
But lets forget about that, and say that we are worried about continuous balance changes, and we are worried about the effect on PvP. For the meme specs, there certainly are some we should be worried about but others not so much.
---
Elemental shaman - very troubling to buff if the buffs also effected PvP, because elemental shamans are optimal on horde premades.
---
Feral druid - Somewhat troubling because it is optimal to take a feral-ish druid for flag running in WSG.
---
Ret paladin - Not really all that troubling since they aren't optimal in serious PvP, so there would have to be very significant buffs to make it all the sudden shift the PvP Meta.
---
Enhancement shaman - They are extremely bad in serious PvP groups (even worse than ret), so insofar as serious PvP goes, we really shouldn't be worried about all but the most extreme buffs to them. 
---
So if we're worried about PvP and don't want a series of balance changes, that is a good reason not to buff ele or feral, but it's not a very good reason not to buff enh or ret.
---
figure out where the big streamers (and their fanbois) go, then avoid those server
---
Verigan's Fist @ level 20 - GREAT mace. Won't quite last until 40-45, SM has an Axe (and a ton of XP from quests / kills) that can be had mid 30's. Verigan's might not be worth it if I can manage a group for a quest chain in Astranaar for Glacial Stone.
---
 The most well populated pvp server possible 
---
LEEEEEEROYYYYU JENKINS!!!!!
---
Congrats
---
It depends.  If you have a very caster heavy raid, the additional Nightfall uptime a hunter can provide may outweigh anything the off tank and an additional DPS could provide.  Otherwise yes, it's better to just have your off tank swing it and have the hunter go pew pew.
---
That’s complete nonsense 
---
as long as you don't run the Warrior talent that automatically puts a debuff on crits (which would take a debuff slot from the raid) , and play Pally as a healer all 3 classes would be good enough to stay in a PvP spec'd build for PvE content. PvP premades will probably get picky making sure you run good builds and professions but the PvE side will be much easier now so it shouldn't be a issue. If she does run a Healer then playing a Warrior would be a great time for you, they destroy in PvP with a pocket healer to back them up
---
You're absolutely right. Classic's initial launch population is going to vastly dwarf Vanilla's.
---
Damn that's brutal, and it's crystal clear to the players that will backfire. If they screw up classic I will avoid all Activision blizzard products forever out of pure hatred. 
---
That isn't how IP laws work at all.  As far as I know all of the private servers are hosted in countries that don't care about US law and any requests to the government of those countries to shut the servers down are pretty much dumped in the trash.
---
Because I was there.. Owned a club ran my own festival... This is fun for a while.. But after some time you just keep chasing a high that you won't find.. People keep dropping out and you need more and more drugs
---
&gt; I'm totally down with this level of theory crafting but the fundamental flaw is that there are too many outside variables you can't account for.
---
Agreed. But what I hope to have is data for options. If I'm expecting 30,000xph at a certain time, and it's so crowded that I'm averaging 15,000 --- and there's what looks like a *good group* forming for SM Cath which has 24,000 base xph from kills, it might be worth jumping in.
---
I just like mathing out options. It's fun for me, and helps bide the time until launch :P
---
Nope there was no 40 v 40 pvp in the demo. So it’s not even close to exactly what happened in the demo.
---
1st time playing was during beta. I won the same competition that joana won where they picked the highest levelers. I think it was 2 per class per server. I am still trying to find that website where they listed peoples names.
---
Deadmines = VC
---
Just a joke, we have coinciding goals for the year and she knows I'm really stoked about Classic. Her goal is to get her business off the ground, which starts at home in her case.
---
Yes, I understand the idea of scaling and why scaling is superior for balancing compared to static damage. That's not the point I'm making.
---
You said that it's possible to add scaling without buffing, but now you are saying it *is* a buff for some gear. It is also a nerf for other gear levels, which is a problem considering some abilities are not even worth using with green gear (feral rake for example).
---
I'm simply pointing out that nomatter how you do it scaling will either make some classes stronger / weaker or it will do nothing, in which case why bother pissing everyone off with changes and then they won't even help anyone.
---
I'm not sure if you read the post.  I'm not supporting loot trading, just reminding you all that people are jerks no matter which loot rules are in place.
---
I mean, I do this in retail during M+ runs if the group consists of meta autists; it's a complete waste of my time otherwise as the key is depleted
---
Whats the point of telling us that, thats common knowledge and it honestly comes across as softening the blow of loot trading
---
To each their own.  So much NONE of the game was PvP to me and my friends, unless we wanted to do something as a guild.  And then we just flagged up and went to BGs or wPvP somewhere.  Even people on a non PvP server can't resist an occasional scrap when a bunch of flagged people show up in their city.  The main difference to me was NO GRIEFING.  None.  Keep your flag off and ignore opp faction.  BGs were a small part of the game and wPvP even smaller.  
---
Compare to private server that only offers PvP where I'm constantly harassed by people who are more interested in preventing my game than playing theirs.  Or making preventing me from playing their whole game.  I've been killed over resources maybe twice of the hundreds of times high level asstards with no business in a lowbie zone killed me for zero challenge.  Forced PvP is only fun for assholes.  
---
Debuff limit will start at 8, then probably get increased in later patch
---
Mage is kinda boring to level compared to Warlock but both have good utility and usefulness in a Dungeon run.
---
When it comes to raid both will have a very simple rotation like most classes
---
Everyone will love the Warlock that joins their dungeon group and goes early to summon the slow pokes in the group, just like they will love the friendly mage in guild that will help teleport them to other cities.
---
Warlock would probably feel a bit more special to play since a lot more people will roll Mage
---
sick burn lol
---
I'm not up all the kids' new fangled slang. [Drage?](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Drage) Which definition should I infer about the warriors in these vids?
---
&gt; A word to describe a person who is slow, or lame.
---
or 
---
&gt; The process by which intense partying, otherwise know as raging, is carried out during daytime hours.
---
&gt; it's not going to break the game and make it unplayable.
---
So you are saying as long as it doesn't directly make the game unplayable it's okay? Let's delete rogues then.
---
&gt; If I play classic for 2 years and I run into this loot problem 2 or 3 times, I would consider that to be "not that common."
---
It's like you didn't even understand what I said. You have no argument. You are throwing out numbers that makes your point look good. I can do the same. What if it happens 2 times *every day*? That sounds bad and would mean I couldn't ever get geared.
---
&gt; You may consider one occurrence to be the end of the world (OMG HOW COULD YOU BLIZZARD /WRISTS).
---
And again, based on random numbers you just made. Only now you choose to try and ridicule me to make your point seem smarter than mine. It really just makes you look super unintellegent.
---
It's good there are pros and cons to the different specs.  It's good there are areas where they excel or don't.  It's good that you can think about how to make your class more viable in a different arena.
---
But you're not willing to take responsibility for your part in it.  You just want the game to let you play what you want.  As long as its viable in a raid, that's all you care about.  Guess what?  The game ain't all about raiding.  
---
Lol judging fans of streamers then playing on an RP server.
---
So you honestly have no response whatsoever and went with that? That just proves my point that your "solution" to the problem is flawed as hell.
---
Whatever pvp server has the highest population 
---
Off tanking as a Druid for raid is very doable, just know you will have to farm Gnomergon for the Weapon that gives 50% haste buff like it's your job :) 
---
I don't think that will ever come back with classic. That idolation was from the rarity and wonder of seeing those things. You still see it in retail with brand new players. But most classic players will be accustomed to those things
---
Not to be negative but how do you know it’s good? 
---
Are you saying that in classic fears didn’t make mobs run aimlessly?  Because that’s patently not true.  The direction was very much random.  Sometimes they’d b line it straight to the next pack of mobs. Trust me I played a lock for years.
---
Yes thats rights. Banish also worked on elementals but similarly elementals werent a big deal in most dungeons (mained Warlock in Vanilla). And that sorta balanced it because banish is really good CC
---
Shaman tank dont have great Aoe aggro so plan to mark things and talk groups through kill order, because you need your spells for most your aggro they cant keep a Raid Boss tanked for long. I'd suggest going the with the Pally route since you will be able to mess around with both Ret and Prot.
---
Yes I know, lots of pummeler runs. I'm still gonna go with my plan. Play with my friend on my priest and play druid to not outlevel each other. Probably won't get to raids for several months with druid or priest. We'll see who wins out.   
---
I aim to help break the stigma of feral druids. As for pallys shams and boomkins, sorry guys lol
---
&gt; If you skip deadmines, that means that you won't get the long follow-up questline in SW that takes you through Stocks and beyond.
---
The Unsent Letter for 1050xp. The follow-up, Bazil Thredd, is shareable. So SOMEONE needs to do The Deadmines. The chain is 12,000xp, and I'd get 11,000 without The Deadmines and getting shared step 2
---
And like the Platinum Disk chain, follow-ups will all be noted as associated with dungeons. The disk chain is like 12,000xp, which might be worth it if you can work it into your route as it's quite a bit of travel.
---
If you're planning on leveling in Tanaris at that point, great, if not, is 12,000xp worth going from Badlands to IF to Tanaris to IF then back to where you're leveling?
---
At level 40 you should be managing 20-30k xph easily within a single zone, 30 minute detour for 20 minutes of xp?
---
But the data will be there. Right now the general consensus for dungeons while leveling is "**¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ maybe?**" I've got time and resources to at least put it into a digestible guide.
---
I have retrieved these for you _ _

I remember the first day I started, it was the day of BWL release. I saw the advertisement for it and thought it was the coolest shit ever. Took forever for me to hit 60 and actually see BWL for the first time.
---
Can you link it?
---
Noone really gives a shit about loot trading or sharding (assuming they will only use for starting zones) except bunch of elitist jerks. Vanilla servers will die after the release.
---
They fun away randomly But always away. So if your lock is good He Will fear safely
---
Are you sure that Bazil Thread is universally shareable, versus shareable only with others who have completed its prerequisite? Many quests in vanilla can be shared but only with people who have completed the prereqs; others get an 'ineligible' error.
---
Classic ain't worth $15 a month when PServers are free and I don't want to support modern WoW. 
---
I don't get this "splitting the community is bad" idea. The community is already horribly split.
---
Pet battlers
---
Mythic Raiders
---
Mythic +
---
Casuals
---
Collectors
---
none of these people really associate with each other anyway.
---
I'd pay a few bucks a month for Pet Battles but I'm not interested in anything else in retail WoW.
---
Owning a club and going to a club are two very different things. I'd never want to own a club.  
---
Side note, you don't need drugs to have fun at raves or festivals, I've gone sober more times than I Haven't and it's always a blast.
---
almost every Profession brings something to the table at 60, it really depend what you want to do with them. Most the Crafting professions have Pre raid best in slot items, everyone needs enchants and potions made from people who spent time to get the rare recipies, Engineering is great for PvP. The easiest route for a druid would probably be to level up using Skinning and Herbalism (possibly keep all the materials from each incase you want to use them to level a profession with them) then at 60 decide one of the 2 to drop and replace with a crafting profession 
---
One of the many reasons druids have it so easy on a new server: quick leveling, travel, and a spammable ability to tag mobs all while being fantastic tanks for five mans and decent enough healers.
---
Because it was hilarious murduring nasty looking horde as a Kate Beckinsale rogue.
---
They've been scripting this server for over 3 years and they also tested it a lot,so I am pretty sure this server will be really good.
---
They're already morally bankrupt and don't make good games any more. I'm sure they can survive on Candy Crush and whatever war series they release. Point is, as a good games company they're pretty much dead already
---
All I did was explain things... I forget that this sub has the mentality of "If I didnt see it, it didnt happen" and "If I cant do it, it cant be done" and "If I don't think it works, it's a memespec." Where did I once "pitch" shaman tanking? You bring your own delusions in when all I did was explain that it works with some stats I had. I never shaman tanked raids, however, but I did explain you can't def cap as a shaman.
---
this is so true, which is why I plan on taking 2 weeks of vacation from work to do this haha
---
This is why I see no problem in warlock tables mage tables and guild banks. Make them cost reagents and just be done with it. I'm typically a no changes guy nowadays but this just feels like a no brainier. I see no downside of doing mage/lock tables, it saves the whole raid alot of time.
---
Not having it. Activision doesnt deserve a cent
---
No they take up healing. That is mana that could be spent on a contributor
---
Fairly certain, but hopefully testable during a beta.
---
Even if it isn't there'll be data to compare whether time spent doing deadmines and then Stocks to work on the Lescovar chain is worth the 12k xp it gives. If you can manage 25,000xph in duskwood at level 23, anything more than 30 minutes spent doing that to open the chain is wasted.
---
Lol it's still a game design problem
---
BGs will almost certainly be cross realm.
---
if you run Nightfall (2 hand axe than makes boss take 15% more spell damage) people would probably take you as a Enhance. Reaistically most groups would want you as Resto but there will be many chill guilds who will just be happy with taking anyone who shows up consistently since the content wont be hard to the point that min maxing is required :) find a cool guild and you can probably roll any spec
---
Except for glancing blows, and guesstimate hit/resist tables for bosses. Plenty of old posts directly state the oppposite of what pservers do as far as static hit/resist tables for every boss.
---
TL;DR, just like you can play Diablo II on BNet today, Classic will be in a decade.
---
Guessing this is on a PVE server? 
---
But MY FUN is more important than YOUR fun1!@!!!  ^^/s

"I prefer windfury, but rockbiter is not bad either."

I think all expansions had some flaws attached, its just on the individual player at how much those flaws annoyed them. For me in Vanilla, for example, I felt like the grind to 60 was *too harsh* in the sense that there wasn't even enough quests to complete to reach 60 and the grind became more of a burden for me, rather than me having fun. Also the rep grind in Vanilla was very difficult and felt even more of a drag to grind. However, some people (like a lot on this sub) didn't mind the extra grind it took to get to level cap and it felt more rewarding for them as well as grinding rep gains from the different factions. 
---
All in all WoW, especially from classic ---&gt; Lich King, most, if not all can agree that time period was the best in WoW history. People just have specific memories and likes/dislikes about each of the first 3 expansions. I just happen to be less bothered by some of the things introduced during Lich King than the other expansions (although you're right some of the things released in Lich King, ended up being the demise of WoW)
---
I'm pretty sure I remember feared mobs running in any random direction so I think you're right
---
As far as rogues are concerned, rushing Deadmines at 20 with a group of 20+ and no other melee dps is worth it. 
---
Not only does it take drastically less time to run it than with a lower level group, but the [Tunic of Westfall](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2041) is BiS until lvl 31 or 35 (31 if you get the lucky world drop, 35 if you can find a Wild LW to craft you [Nightscape Tunic](http://classicdb.ch/?item=8175)). And since it's a quest reward, you're sure to get it.
---
Then on top of that, if you're lucky enough you can get [Cruel Barb](http://classicdb.ch/?item=5191) off VC, which is BiS until someone puts up a [Viking Sword](http://classicdb.ch/?item=3186) on the AH or you manage to get your hands on one while leveling (whether off a lucky drop or a Heavy Bronze Lockbox).   
---
Unless you go Horde in which case you'll definitely want to do the quest to spawn Baron Aquanis in BFD ([Amongst the Ruins](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=6921)), so you can get the quest that yields the sweet [Outlaw Sabre](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16886) as a reward. That quest starts off an item he drops for the whole party too, so you can also just tag along in a group where someone has the required quest to spawn him.
---
Now as to the matter of "will it save 45 minutes over the next few hours?". The answer is definitely if you're Alliance and manage to get Cruel Barb (it's roughly a 20% drop chance). You can probably catch up to someone who'd kept on grinding while you ran the dungeon in about 3 hours, then pass them. If you're Horde, I'd just skip the Deadmines completely and aim solely for BFD asap (though it will take a while to do so, the quest to kill Aquanis can be stealth rushed at 23 if you bring 2-3 other rogues with you and kick him in sequence so he can't cast for shit)
---
&gt; But then, what if this player doing 800 dps is a meme spec ?
---
... then it wouldn't be a meme spec.
---
That is not the case and not how loot trading worked at implementation. If you can’t trade need rolled items loot trading is pointless to add as it solves nothing as far as misclicked or master traded loot.
---
There are simple reasons why people complain about loot trading.
---
In Vanilla, think about it, loot trading could grant you what, between 2 and 10 golds per item sold to the NPC, maximum, right?
---
With loot trading, you have 2 new solutions that are way better :
---
1) You can give it to a friend in the group that needs the loot more than you / that needed it in the first place, so you came in the group to increase his chances to get it.
---
2) You can roll for it although you don't need it (and even not look as a ninja by needing some gear you can actually wear, and temporally hide your better real gear), and sell it to a group member that needs it really bad. Sometimes you will be able to sell it for waaaay more than a few gold like you do at the NPC. Like 50+ or 100+ gold.
---
It isn't hard to understand why it motivates a lot to ninja with those possibilities imo. I won't do it personally, but I am 100% sure more people will do it with loot trading than without. You can't say it will be the same than in 2004-2006. Back then there were very few ninja according to general opinions (I personally can't even remember to have seen one tbh).
---
farming as Prot is a terrible time, if your time is gonna be limited you will probably be able to enjoy the game more as a Hunter
---
&gt; The answer is definitely if you're Alliance and manage to get Cruel Barb (it's roughly a 20% drop chance).
---
So definitely maybe? :P
---
played prot pally in private server and people were soo antsy about me drinking in between pulls but noone rly ever said anything cuz tank 
---
Yes I want to punish people who were not paying attention. Knowing what you need, communicating with the group, etc. I don't like the idea that people can just always trade stuff and "fix" it if they didn't focus or talk to each other.
---
Sharding is not fine if it affects contested zones at all. Outside of that it’s minimal inconvenience.
---
Loot trading is a bigger deal than sharding by far, engaging and getting caught is likely to never happen with loot trading. 
---
&gt; The real problem with this scenario is puggable raid content 
---
To me not really. The real problem with this scenario is PuG dungeons. All the time when you'll be farming your precious pre-raid gear, you will face that situation. Knowing how hard / long it can be to actually loot a piece of gear you want, there will be nothing more frustrating than imagining/realizing someone ninjaed it from you for some money or to give it to their friend.
---
And as the other guy says, "then do dungeons with friends/guild" is not a solution. I should be able to do PuG dungeons. Vanilla was like that, and was intended that way. Why couldn't I do it?
---
Loot trading is bad. Better remove GM tickets that won't happen that much compared to actual ninja stuff.
---
I'm kinda confused. Isn't this how the game should be? I've braved Blackrock Mountain and defeated an elemental lord and the black dragon flight. I've purged the Qiraji threat from Silithus, fought back an invasion of undead, lead the charge into a foriegn world and stopped the legion from becoming a threat, and traveled to the coldest parts of the planet to finally put an end to the undead threat to our world. Shouldn't NPC's treat me like a freaking hero? It's ridiculous to think that I wouldn't be known by every soldier that enlists with the Alliance / Horde after everything that I've accomplished.
---
I don't get why people complain so much about sharding meanwhile they are totally fine with dynamic respawn on private servers. Sharding is litterly ONLY for a very short amount of time in the starting zones only, meanwhile on private servers we have a constant of dynamic respawn (2 hour respawn on rare mobs instead of 8 hours etc) and people are like "private servers does it better" almost. Come on, private servers are way worse then what we heard blizzard is currently making. Ofc that can change....
---
Exactly.
---
Shadow priest are great in PvP and both would have that dot style rotation but in raids with debuff limits is probably gonna be just using 1 spells,  Warlocks utility will really make you feel useful and appreciated tho 
---
One fear I have is that it will start a culture where people are discouraged from needing for offspec and are instead told to roll greed and pay the person who won it to get the item.
---
Yes, we have no idea. Then it's important to be vocal and make blizzard understand we don't want loot trading in cases we are describing, where you can literally scam people easier, and with better rewards by clicking need.
---
If they haven’t worked that out by now they are never going to. 
---
I don't think you know what loyal means...
---
Most liely, that's their initial deadline, but they cannot announce it yet, because they are not sure if they'll make it. And, they won't say "Planning for July 16, but not sure if we make it", that's not what good companies say, right?
---
But still, they somehow wanted to hint the release date, without officially announcing it, and without compromising themselves on stage.
---
&gt; If nothing else it will make sure that people make friends and group with people they trust.
---
You didn't need to have that mindset in Vanilla. You could PuG, without having to think about that. I loved PuG, I want to do that again. Why should it change? To hell GM tickets. No people I know nor me used that at the time, and there will obviously be way more ninja stuff people will complain about than actual error GM tickets avoided with loot trading.
---
10 people per zone, they didn't even say how many yet... Also u might be okay with long queue times &amp;  long wait times for quests, but not everyone who wants to try classic again/for the first time want to use 50 mins on a "kill 10 boars in Valley of Trials"
---
Forgive me. 
---
Sorry but I've other things to do. In Vanilla it was way simpler. It doesn't need to change just because of GM tickets. Just remove GM tickets and don't put loot trading. People will concentrate and do less mistakes. If they do one, it's on them. But let's not encourage people to ninja.
---
Priest main here. I'm stuck between feral and priest. Raids as warlock you will spam sbolt. Raids as spriest would be hard to land a spot. Warlocks seem very unique and less common on alliance side. Warlocks are so damn useful in classic due to no dungeon stones, summoning is so important. Now's a good chance to change your flavor up.   
---
   
---
However, if you like having the option to heal and need that option for a main, it changes the whole decision
---
The problem comes with classes like Pally and Druid (and to a lesser extent, Shaman) that can use a very wide variety of items as (sometimes) Pallies will wear Priest cloth, while Druids get their usual gear pool + rogue gear.
---
While I plan on being a Feral druid, I know I will be fighting against rogues for most of my gear because of how I intend to play mah druid.
---
Druids 100% have to farm Gnomergon, the weapon is BiS it gives you 90 seconds of +50% haste which is worth more than the attack power from Ateish, Farming stuff as druid will be super easy and Shadow Dps is a god in PvP 
---
No, don't waste your time choosing that stuff. Good you have it planned out if you want to nab names fast and get ahead of the curve
---
If they use the same old server names it would be interesting because old friends might be choosing it too! 
---
Go 30/0/21 spec sham. Apparently works well into bwl. Resto in the streets, ele in the sheets
---
while I like the idea of hating gnomes it might be tricky to explain why an Orc is helping the Alliance after he got transformed
---
Thanks /u/Muufokfok, My friends are 50/50 with Alliance vs Horde, but that actually makes me loads happier to hear both sides of it, for Spriest and Lock.
---
"Now's a good chance to change your flavor up.", that is actually a fantastic point.
---
Thank you for such a detailed review on both, It does make me want to side more with Warlock!
---
That seems fine, when the game has a foreseeable end and a natural reset. Yet when the game goes on for 14+ years, where do you peak? Am I the guy who just spearheaded the defeat an intergalactic army of immortal super monsters, and now I'm back to fighting wolves and pirates? 
---
Most RPG games of this style would end, and you'd either replay it or wait for a sort of "reset" caused by something like a sequel. Like your powers would be lost, or you'd be playing as a different character entirely. Thinking Final Fantasy, TES, or Dragon Age franchises. Yet with WoW we don't have a compelling 'reset' happen very often. Outside of the ability pruning we saw a while back, we're just growing in power, gaining more levels, and getting more and more powerful items. The first compelling reset we had was the loss of our artifact weapons in Legion, but we were still already at a demi-god-like status before that. So it still kinda falls flat of the mark.
---
A basic story arc is 
---
1) Exposition
---
2) Rising action
---
3) Climax
---
4) Falling Action
---
5) Resolution
---
Yet it after Vanilla it's felt more like we go from the resolution, right back into rising action. We never really a solid "bottom" to rise back up to. We're just rising into the stratosphere. 
---
I took off my clothes and started dancing in Northsire.

---
Confirming inbalance was not intentional. 
---
I can verify that it was there in Vanilla. Possible it wasn't in from the very beginning, I didn't start playing until 1.4.
---
Thanks for the reply /u/Antidomeitic, Muufokfok also mirrored that Warlock utility is much desired in Classic, and I will admit I forgot about the debuff limitations. Thank you very much for your response. I definitely feel a whole lot stronger with going Warlock!
---
yeah I was more talking about boomy when I was saying you can fuck shit up, its good at kiting and has great damage, the problem is going oom really fast, but if you're smart about how you choose targets and play it can definitely be strong
---
Ah, you are a star, thank you for finding that
---
This is the exact one I came to be happy about. These characters are gods, yet they are constantly struggling while receiving little to no help from some of the strongest people in the known world. 
---
Hmmm I did turn casual dad a few weeks ago, will keep it in mind!
---
To me the most fun part is pvp too, but like you said to each of their own. I love fighting for resources, world bosses etc. Sudently having 2 huge raids fight eachother over a raid boss, or fighting for the skinning the Dinos in Un'Goro. On PVE servers i can't do that, then i will just sit spamming to skin the mob right after losing cause some alliance player is sitting next to me waiting for me to loot to steal the skinning.
---
I personally also love the PVP interactions when i just meet someone, if someone kills me i find it super fun to find the guy and get my revenge. I can understand why some people don't like this though.
---
Thanks I actually never played vanilla haha. Been playing a lock up to 35 on a pservers to get my kick out of the only class I haven't tried besides Hunter. Always played necro in D2 however not crazy about maining a DPS class. Warlocks are super awesome utility.   
---
I suggest trying an instant 60 private server and play some of the BGs they have. Get a feel for it. I did a shaman and realized I'll never like shamans even though I love their utility
---
Yeah if you go Ret or Prot and the only thing you can offer is a mediocre dps/tanking and a 10/30 min buff and an aura you are pretty fucked. Just go Holy, wear clothes like some lame peasant priest and do something useful.
---
Im not saying that it shpuld change, but thats the reality. Some classes are just better than others by a wide margin, period. Dont go to vainilla expecting real diversity or a semblance of "balance", both the state of the game and the druid spec.
---
Or maybe Dr Age?! Your guess is as good as any :p
---
Can’t wait for kids to get 1-2 shot by a trash mob and rage quit 😂 
---
Started in January 2006. Things I remember that stand out to me about my first weeks:
---
* I read most of the manual during the first weeks of playing. I remember the illustration with the heights of all the different races, and a line about female and male characters being equally powerful and that appearance was the only difference.
---
* Spent a long time on the character creation screen, reading through all the information about roles and racials. I picked Night Elf Priest.
---
* The first time I died was in the spider cave in the starting zone in Teldrassil. 
---
* When I reached about level 8, I entered Darnassus for the first time and the music felt so epic.
---
* When I reached level 10, my friend (who had a level 60 and was raiding Molten Core) gave me 1 gold and I thought it was a massive amount of money. I never asked for, or was given any more, but grinded my own money. I learned to use the auction house early and tried to sell just about everything.
---
* Kept forgetting to spend talent points. My friend kept reminding me. At level 20 I had 4 or 5 to spend.
---
* After the Wetlands Run™ this weird grey/yellow/red suit of armour popped up, and I remember thinking it was probably related to how I'd leveled up, because new things kept happening when I leveled up. Was fully red and kept dying like a fly before I learned about repairs...
---
* It took me about 3 months to level to 60. 
---
Instead of 
---
&gt;"Sweet, I got exactly what I wanted on my first run!"
---
Use:
---
&gt;"You fucking troll! I'll make sure you never raid again on this server you shit-faced fuck jizz! Fuuuccckkkk!"
---
Is this on retro wow or something?
---
Giving PvP advice when you apparently never do any pvp at all, amazing.
---
Oh boy times were sure different.
---
Which class will generally get the most loot from PVE? I know its weird to try and base my class depending on gear but I played nothing but Rogue back in the day and remember how much of a struggle it was to get gear. I want the feeling of being able to get what I want lol. Im interested in Shadow Preist, thoughts?
---
There is no more need to dream on some old memes, check out this  new one!
---
&gt; Why does everyone hate loot trading?
---
The reason why is because of how it can be abused. Pretend there's a 2-handed weapon you really want for your warrior while in a dungeon as you're leveling. The tank also wants it for himself since he doesn't tank normally while leveling. Your friends, a Paladin and Hunter, can also use the weapon but want to give it to you.
---
4 people roll "Need" on the weapon, and the Paladin wins the roll. He then gives you the weapon. 
---
This immediately ruins the spirit of the loot system because one player effectively had 3 rolls.
---
&gt; I thought back when it was originally implemented, classes that could actually wear the item could roll Need and you could only loot trade items you won via Greed
---
No, you could never trade anything that was BoP.
---
Too real
---
But.. but?! I thought AQ40 and naxx were impossible to do with memespecs in it?! What is that travesty?!
---
I remember when they used to do free server transfers for people who were on overpopulated to target low population servers, not sure if thats still a thing. 
---
Way to go to maintain the hype and have people that will play the game you will play on release if it works. Nice.
---
I think the whole selling items under the table lost them the moral high ground long ago
---
Your argument has some merit but...
---
Clearly you seem to think that most guilds will be able to rush through MC in no time and that it wasn't like that back then so it would screw up the "vanilla experience". That's where I disagree.
---
How do you explain that Conquest got the world firsts on 5 bosses (Gehennas to Sulfuron) the very same night? There goes your theory of "progressing slowly through the bosses" being an authentic "vanilla experience". Just because that wasn't YOUR case, doesn't mean it was the case of some others. And even nowadays on pservers some guilds manage to wipe here and there coz of a random mistake made by someone in the raid.  
---
Granted the 1.12 itemization WILL make MC easier than it used to be, there's no denying that, and thus you are right to think that as far as the majority of the casual players is concerned tuning MC upwards will make it more "entertaining" so to speak as it'll feel closer to what they remember from back then. But there'll always be the hardcore gamers who won't give a single crap about MC being buffed, they'll just rickroll through it like a breeze. Coz these people are the ones who used to welcome challenging raids and weren't whining for Blizzard to nerf things over and over "because it's too hard". So yeah, they'll just shrug and do their thing.  
---
Teleport!
---
Woops, I had read it otherwise. Sorry !
---
But can I tank as a Paladin or Shaman?
---
You mean the entire Pserver fresh experience.
---
By looking at their gear. 
---
Looks like a mob kill in D3
---
Yes it is absolutely nice, some guilds even do split Onyxia/MC runs with 10 or even more empty slots to increase the amount of loot they get! 
---
Pirate servers will never have any moral high ground. 
---
&gt; You didn't need to have that mindset in Vanilla. You could PuG, without having to think about that.
---
vs. 
---
&gt; there will obviously be way more ninja stuff people will complain about than actual error GM tickets avoided with loot trading.
---
These seem like two contradicting ideas. Either you don't have to worry about ninja looting in pugs, or more ninja loots will happen than misclicked master loot items. I don't see how you can believe both. 
---
What makes you think that Loot Trading scammers will not face consequences? Ninja looters are getting caught too, right?
---
I'll be here ready and waiting to upvote you soldier. Personally believe that no class needs a Nerf, just more classes need A LOT of love, hybrid DPS, late game hunter DPS.  
---
I think it's 4 parts actually, belsum or beldrum or something I think? And indeed people camping the tools + gnolls hitting you when you finally clicked first.... 
---
Shevra hooves
---
No. Private server quirks do not equal retail classic. 
---
The *Test of Faith* and another *tests* in Thousand Needles.
---
It was really unique experience when you got teleported to a top of that "stone tower" you are not able to reach otherwise besides doing this quest. 
---
People who are smart enough to scam via loot trade are smart enough to not get caught. If you can’t prove it, or don’t catch them. How are they facing punishment? Sure some will get caught and be punished via community but most wont. There weren’t any ninja looters that weren’t getting caught in Vanilla.
---
If you’re smart enough to unequip gear so you can roll on it for your friend, you’re smart enough to not get caught wearing the gear until you have plausible deniability on the loot.
---
Druids can solo princess / mushrooms too.
---
Yeah strength is 3.036 AP with kings and zg but agility is worth 3.3-3.4 AP with kings and zg. The thing is agi gives 1 AP but it also increases your crit and the value of agility depends mostly on what is the value of crit to your abilities. Each abilty have their own crit value which changes each time you add more crit or more AP. I have done all the theorycrafting and created a dynamic spreadsheet for vanilla feral cat to find the exact stat weights with any gear combinations.
---
Agility stays higher than strength in AP value until you reach soft crit cap which is 54,4% when you are hit capped. Abother thing would be if you used Rip, then strength would be of higher value. However you cant use Rip due to limited debuff slots, it is never an optimal debuff.
---
Well, for one rogue out of five it'll be worth it. Question then becomes, are you the one?
---
Well met
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
This shit needs to be kept out of Classic. Nothing was more retarded than playing on the EQ TLP servers and people say "just buy a krono to instantly gear up!" like it was acceptable to toss down 18 dollars to get some decent gear instead of working for it.
---
Tank shaman is barely viable in 5 mans when very geared.
---
Please, do go on.  Your tears nourish me.
---
Yes I remember that, pre-flood 1k Needles is the best!
---
If you pvp a lot don't consider night elf because desperate prayer is your best friend, especially if shadow.  Humans will be at a disadvantage vs rogues.  Dwarfs are stoic monsters.
---
Best regards, 
---
Every Private Server ever.
---
Activision Elemental
---
Rogue would work very well in this setup so you don't have to share gear and you would benefit greatly from shaman always in group.
---
They can just unequip the item that their buddy needs from the dungeon before they join the group. 
---
Mages are very boring to level and raid with.  However in pvp they are tons of fun and aoe farming is pretty engaging if your attempting 20 elites at a time in brd  =D.  I have fallen asleep multiple times while raiding on mage and there are a few twitch vods of others doing so too.
---
If you go the pvp route all classes are meaningful.
---
&gt;Debuff will start at 16.
---
It's not still a thing, but if memory serves, it didn't really have the desired effect.  It essentially just created ghost-town servers instead of balanced servers.  That's when they went to connected realms which is nice in theory, but has it's own set of problems.
---
What are you expecting server caps to be???? In Vanilla 2,000 people in STV would mean damn near all of the online players were in a single zone... I don't think they have flat out said what server populations will be limited to, but I hope its not like private servers where you have 10k people on at once....
---
&gt; I didn't. I suggested alternatives. Most grown ups tend to appreciate this.
---
As you go through life, you may discover that people do not think you are actually being helpful and grownup if they ask for information about how a house is built and you respond with a long-winded opinion about how it is purely subjective opinion that being in a house is better than standing in the rain.
---
&gt; There's nothing stupid about it. The objective of playing a computer game is to have fun. We all have different ways of reaching that objective.
---
If you have the brain function I expect of a reasonably bright five year old, you can grasp that different games facilitate certain kinds of fun better than others. If you want to express your mime skills you are better off playing Charades than Bridge. If you want to screw around with a failed build option you are better off doing it just about anywhere other than in the collective action portion of a gear-based and class-based MMORPG.
---
And thinking you are entitled to have build options deliberately kept bad in such a game so you can have the "fun" of being terrible in a raid is just magnificently self-centred and perverse.
---
&gt; The designers of vanilla decided to make paladins smashing evil with a big hammer in Naxxramas very difficult.
---
You appear to have reading comprehension issues on this point. They did not decide to make ret paladins in Naxx terrible. They decided to make ret paladins viable *and failed to achieve their goal*.
---
&gt; I'll go back and kit out meme specs when I've cleared the game. I've got a long term view of this game.
---
But why the entitlement to be able to fuck around in this way with meme specs in particular? Like I said, if your goal is to fuck around with bad characters there are lots of ways to build bad characters other than having meme specs handed to you on a platter. Raid with no pants or shirt, or don't spend your talent points at all. Wear the items so bad they normally get sharded on sight. The sky is the limit if you only use your imagination.
---
&gt; I am not intending to deliberately suck, even when playing a meme spec. If a player gets the most out of the kit they're given, that's not sucking. That's also the point you cannot seem to grasp.
---
I do not grasp it because you are making no sense. You can play a dude who wears no shirt or pants and make the most out of it. You can spend no talent points and make the most out of it. You can adopt any arbitrary handicap you like and then make the most out of it.
---
Why does Blizzard have to pander to your weird goals by giving you meme specs to make the most of, when the number of dumb builds or ideas you can make the most out of is unlimited?
---
To be raid-viable you need Blizzard code support. To make the most of something stupid you don't need any support at all, you can do it all by yourself.
---
&gt; I don't think someone sucks if their "numbers" aren't as good as another spec. The specs weren't well balanced, so assessing someone's skill must be based on the kit they're given. It's all relative, my friend.
---
I think you are being deliberately obtuse. Someone not pulling their weight is sucking in the sense I obviously intended, regardless of whether they are not pulling their weight because they are bad at hitting buttons or because they are good at hitting buttons but are self-indulgently playing a snowflake spec in a collective gear-based enterprise.
---
Enter your mom's credit card and it gives you a random legendary
---
The Ancient Egg questline, which ranges from killing a few non-elites in Feralas all the way up to LBRS bosses and warns you about Hakkar in ZG. Finishing that one is a bit of an accomplishment because getting the egg itself is a pain and all but requires a group and the Avatar of Hakkar is a machanically complex boss for vanilla.
---
a random group of 4 people (none who are streamers) could be shit talking you in whispers or voice coms anyway, and for any stream with a decent viewer base they will probably have their own guild and play with friends or viewer over a random they would mock anyway
---
Wow seriously? I love that! Is that a private server thing? Do you think that will be in Classic? I'm so sold if that'll be in Classic.
---
I guess yeah if you find other Pal to do it with.  Otherwise it's kind of lame to bail from two different dungeon groups after 1st boss. 
---
Hope your hard earned work doesn't vanish in an instant
---
Yeah for sure.  I just wish pre-bis had more stats instead of flat ap.
---
Just tell them to heal themself since they can do it.
---
Wow, a decent resto spec shaman jumping into melee combat vs a warlock.  Difficulty, "easy".  Nice. 
---
It doesn’t have to be 100% or even 50% of the people who do this. It does turn everyone who already is an asshole into a more effective asshole, though, and without others really knowing, unlike a ninja looter.
---
I like that a classic community can band together against blatant ninjas. I don’t like a classic community that is skeptical of and disappointed in each other for abusing a system in secrecy.
---
I admit I'm kind of drawn to tanking.
---
Back in FFXIV (I know, not a comparable experience at all), when I spent most of my playtime maining a DRK, everytime I'd go into a dungeon the time spent waiting was literally zero, so it was real nice in order to get rolls and fashion. Maining DRK was also how I met whom I consider today my bunch of best friends ever. I also had many events in other MMOs in which playing some sort of warrior has led me to amazing things.
---
I'm kinda infatuated to go through leveling hell, aren't I.
---
lol you shouldve just said theyre fucking retards and left the group, gl finding another tank to stick it through with them
---
I quit before the game got too out of hand, so I don't know what you mean by intergalactic super army.
---
The power climb seemed natural in WoW*. Onyxia and Nefarian were the children of Deathwing, not actually aspects themselves. The Qiraji were an ancient threat, but they were still being lead by a creature on its death bed, and Naxx was high ranking undead that were sent at us.
---
TBC had us fighting some powerful lore figures, but technically, we were fighting the losers of WC3. Wrath had us fight the winner and it made since that we fought the rank 2 guys before we fought the rank 1 guy in Northrend.
---
*Okay, having to level up every expansion was pretty dumb, and fighting wolves after stopping powerful demons from entering our world is unexplainable.
---
lol r you the rogue
---
I was a loyal Blizzard fan until they forsook my loyalty.
---
They don’t deserve support currently imo
---
/waves 
---
It's typically best to do the whole chain with other paladins
---
I have a soft spot for The Scythe of Elune!
---
Because a ninja is painfully obvious. Loot trading though, you would never have an inkling of an idea that it happened. A possible solution would be to have a message sent to everyone else who was viable for trading so people know it happens. I still think it would happen so much that the community would be desensitized to it that the collective outcry would drown out any one offender.
---
I can see that, though as a Lore buff I have a bias to put more emphasis on the power of certain characters. Archimonde could literally one shot people on a whim, and leveled a city with a sand castle spell. Then Kil'jaeden, his equal, shows up and we just knock him back into the Sunwell like it's wack-a-mole. I guess I just overall have lots of standing issues with how "power" works in WoW and I'm taking it out here. I do this a lot lol
---
That last one reminded me of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H1Koac9s\_I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H1Koac9s_I).
---
Well, considering how long WoW has been running, titles do seem to breed titles.
---
Except it’s the elitist jerks who will abuse loot trading the most, because they’d fuck other people over for pixels.
---
I miss old school ZG too, the zandalar tribe rep grind!
---
for Dungeons it only depends who you bring with you so I'll assume you mostly wanna know about Raids. Most guild will do a DKP system where attendance has the biggest effect on how much loot you get and how quickly. As for other cases the Tanks get a decent amount of priority on gear to make sure they can survive bosses, for a Shadow Priest specifically most people will want to avoid giving you gear from raid since it isnt the best dps class and becomes viable later when you get a talent to increase the dmg warlocks do. This will mostly be a problem if you are in a hardcore guild tho, most guilds will be pretty casual about it and give you equal gear to other caster dps if your attendance is good and you spent the time before raids to get consumables and most of your pre raid BiS so it shows you put in effort  :)  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Zt8bueFk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6422](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Zt8bueFk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6422) Kevin Jordan also said that on Classic Cast.
---
What's that about?
---
They will ruin it. If not at the outset, then soon after.  Activision always takes a short-term, exploitative view on games.  
---
Because Warlock DPS sucks in MC/BWL compared to a Mage
---
You can hop on their beta test server and test it for yourself, I've tested some end game content and also asked a GM to level me to 1 again and tested a few starting zones, it looks really polished so far.
---
But yeah, we have to wait til the launch to have a 100% opinion on it.
---
He’s not your guy, buddy! 
---
I think a lot of it will still exist.  Maybe less worship and more respect.  Respect for the dedication it took to get that good or to get that gear (depending on what it is you notice).
---
I miss Shaman tanking in an earthshock build.
---
Gear been able to make up for the lost time will be a case by case bases and honestly it'll depend on class/route you plan to take. Its impossible to say but in general I'd say no. If you can get a weapon drop off a quest in a dungeon that gives a decent DPS increase and you know that no quest can give something akin to that , then in that case go for it.
---
For speed leveling though either skip it or dry run on a private server.
---
I want to be geared quickly, is Priest viable?
---
they may also wanna give good Priest items to healers first , also less popular classes will have less people fighting over items to compete with. Most raids wont have many druids so they can easily nab their set pieces where a Warrior will be fighting against 2 tanks and 6 dps for it
---
I don't think you understand it, if you think that it will affect the entire class the same way.  What it does to the class is dependent on other factors (mainly, gear).
---
If you are undergeared it's a nerf.  If you're overgeared it's a buff.
---
So if you take a class that is way too strong without gear and way too weak when it has gear, then you balance it out by buffing scaling and nerfing the base values.
---
It's not about balancing the class in a snapshot in time, but balancing the progression of the class.
---
He's not your buddy, friend!
---
I imagine they would keep it. Did anyone play the classic demo that can verify?
---
I’m pretty sure that the cracked silithid carapace is a 100% drop rate from the silithid ripper but horde only. 
---
Even semi-hardcore will barely be 60 in a month.
---
I’m not familiar with Diablo II’s MMO-style of multiplayer. Does it have realms? Does population matter? Are GMs still active?
---
But isn't that more a function ofages just having free hit from talents at that gear level?
---
Mages also out DPS furys in budget gear and in early content, that doesn't mean that you forego bringing furys. Doing so gimps your end game progress. Min/Maxing to cater to the first two raids while hurting later progression doesn't seem that efficient.
---
You could do lower level dungeons with 5 hunters. They'll all probably be better than average players since they're rushing too. 
---
Ah we finally go back to simpler times :)
---
Properly buffed/geared shaman tanks can come close to a bear tank's stats.
---
If you want to know if it is worth it.
---
The difference in time to kill per mob multiplied by the number of mobs. Then you've got the difference in time from completing dungeon quests versus the time it would take to gain that XP from leveling. Deduct the time to hand in those quests if you have to go a location you would have otherwise not gone to and deduct the time to travel to and from the dungeon. 
---
I seriously doubt it's actually worth doing dungeons. Fast leveling is about getting ahead of the bell curve and staying there. If you come out of a dungeon you may end doing quests with others in the middle of the bell curve which will significantly slow you down.
---
If it's the one I'm thinking of, he is referring to the Sven's Camp questline. Sven, an NPC who was chased off his farm (or something) sends you all over Duskwood collecting clues to his family's past. It comes out later that the Scythe of Elune is what created the worgen in Duskwood and both the worgen and the WoW equivalent of LOTR's nazghul (those undead horse riders?) are looking for the Scythe. 
---
You never actually see the scythe, but it's very lore heavy.
---
It's player-created 8 player games that come and go. Just agreeing that simplicity has made it stick around so well.
---
I have been playing melee hunter for quite a while now. I and a few other people are the "forerunners" of the specs and have on multiple occasions surpassed other dps classes.
---
I made my first toon (night elf hunter) in like, 7th grade from a free trial and I was in awe of the scenery and the gameplay. Going to enjoy that again for sure
---
more than likely classic will save bliz
---
You people need to get over this. I was at launch, and parts of beta and yes, I want Sharding in the fucking start zones. Past that, no, but when it takes an hour to get the wolves, vermin and workers you need get done half of northshire that is more of a detractor to the fresh start than seeing 30 people instead of 120, and allows us to advance. If they shard cities or any zones past the first then I'll join the mass quit and continue to play private servers, but I want functional NA servers and don't want to waste time with the same fuckery I did in 2004 trying to level. Call me whatever names make you feel superior, but I have my opinion and as long as Blizzard isn't lying to us then I'm fine with the Sharding. 
---
Every class gets a quest that sends you unto sunken Temple at 50, the rewards are unique and pretty good even after you ding 60 (not pre bis though). Its a dungeon with tons of quests but a bit time consuming, shade of hakkar requires a quest to summon and eranikus is fcking hard at 50ish. All in all speed levelers wont touch that instance but it is great for everyone else. Be sure to have skinning for the drakes
---
I see, that would make sense, I stayed out of Duskwood for the most part.
---
Priests are typically considered the best healers so people like to give them gear, but they are also the most popular healer so you will have more competition
---
BE COOL MON
---
For Christmas one year my family got me a guide on how to play WoW.  Not only was it outdated, but I had a more detailed understanding of the game than anything in that guide.
---
(This is when I had spent the last 4-5 years playing the game 50+ hours/week...and spent another 20+ hours a week talking about the game or looking things up on wowhead/wowwiki).
---
Narrator: *He quit after level 45*
---
If Classic isn't 100% accurate, how will the private servers be?
---
I agree with you on the moral high ground.
---
Group 8 is the short bus for the retadins and oomkins to fend for themselves.
---
That's for the scenario of launch. Which in that case you'd be right. It would be a massive hindrance as you'd set yourself back. But if you're in the area and a group is forming, and you have the quests or they can share them, I think it'd be a huge plus in many scenarios. 
---
As much as people shit on Gnomer, the amount of XP you can get from there and the items can be carried into end game (primarily talking about the water breathing staff). Now I don't know if being able to breath underwater will offset an hours worth of much better xp you could be getting but I sure as hell know it will save you a bunch of time in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Once you hit the 40's some classes heavily rely on being able to run a dungeon just so leveling is smoother. Am I saying dungeons are the best way to get XP? No not really. Do they have a bunch of benefits that will ease things up for the not as hardcore leveler? Of course. 
---
I think twinks use and has better stats for some classes.
---
That's great! I remember?
---
But why would you want to skip a ton of content and interacting with other plays just to get to 60 marginally faster and in a much more boring manner? 
---
ahh, I couldnt remember of it was 8 or 16 thanks for the correction :) 
---
Thanks for this reply, it's becoming something I look forward to.
---
&gt; As you go through life, you may discover that people do not think you are actually being helpful and grownup if they ask for information about how a house is built and you respond with a long-winded opinion about how it is purely subjective opinion that being in a house is better than standing in the rain.
---
As you go through life, you may find that many people you meet are able to see through terrible analogies.
---
&gt; If you have the brain function I expect of a reasonably bright five year old, you can grasp that different games facilitate certain kinds of fun better than others. 
---
Sure, what makes MMOs special is that the world offers so many different styles of play. You can be motivated to explore, or PvP, or craft/trade, or do speed runs through dungeons, or, yes, raid.
---
&gt; If you want to screw around with a failed build option you are better off doing it just about anywhere other than in the collective action portion of a gear-based and class-based MMORPG.
---
I don't want to screw around with a failed build.
---
&gt; And thinking you are entitled to have build options deliberately kept bad in such a game so you can have the "fun" of being terrible in a raid is just magnificently self-centred and perverse.
---
I don't think I'm entitled to any such thing. Blizzard is not changing the specs. That's about all there is to it. And there's nothing magnificently self-centered and perverse about wanting to play a spec that isn't as good as others, so long as the group agrees with an understanding of the consequences of having a suboptimal spec.
---
&gt; You appear to have reading comprehension issues on this point. They did not decide to make ret paladins in Naxx terrible. They decided to make ret paladins viable and failed to achieve their goal.
---
I do not have reading comprehension issues, and that's just a dumb high school debate tactic.
---
They did not once during 1.1 to 1.12 ever decide to buff ret paladins sufficiently to make them well suited for a raid DPS role. They also didn't lack the imagination or understanding of how to do so. The developers were very clear when they talked about hybrid classes. Paladins, for instance, were meant as a class that was more fun for beginners, so that they could try different things out. Funny that, not having raid performance at the top of their mind.
---
&gt; But why the entitlement to be able to fuck around in this way with meme specs in particular?
---
Can you elaborate on what you mean by entitlement? Once Naxx is cleared, what's wrong with getting guildies together and running meme specs through the raids?
---
&gt; Wear the items so bad they normally get sharded on sight. The sky is the limit if you only use your imagination.
---
"Bad" -- there's more of this black and white absolutism. You seem like a player that thinks "good" == "ideal for raiding" and "bad" == "undesirable for raiding." To be honest, this is such a stubbornly simplistic perspective that I can't even find a cell in my brain that can relate to it.
---
&gt; Like I said, if your goal is to fuck around with bad characters there are lots of ways to build bad characters other than having meme specs handed to you on a platter. 
---
You literally can't get the idea that meme specs are inherently "bad" out of your head. Melee sorceresses weren't "bad" in Diablo 2 just because they weren't nearly as good as traditional caster sorceresses. They couldn't clear content as well, but when you got it kitted out, it was a fun playstyle.
---
Consider that _everything_ you're saying rests on the belief that meme specs are "bad" because their numbers suck. You are actually missing out on an entire universe of gaming possibilities because of that fixation.
---
It's true that guilds need to weigh the freedom of players to chose their spec with the hard constraints of boss encounters. Two things: 1. raids are just one part of the game, and specs that are bad for raids can be great for other things, and 2. guilds don't have to be in a rush to clear Naxx as fast as possible, and many guilds may very well prefer a more drawn out PvE endgame that comes with a more casual approach.
---
&gt; I do not grasp it because you are making no sense. You can play a dude who wears no shirt or pants and make the most out of it. You can spend no talent points and make the most out of it. You can adopt any arbitrary handicap you like and then make the most out of it.
---
I'm not talking about arbitrarily handicapping myself. I'm talking about the fun of exploring specs that weren't too popular. You don't see the difference, and it's making this conversation difficult.
---
&gt; Why does Blizzard have to pander to your weird goals by giving you meme specs to make the most of, when the number of dumb builds or ideas you can make the most out of is unlimited?
---
They don't have to pander to me, and they won't, and I wouldn't want them to anyway. However, what they _will_ do with the game, irrespective of our input, is give us exactly the same specs we had during vanilla.
---
&gt; To be raid-viable you need Blizzard code support.
---
Indeed. Blizzard's code for zoning into raid instances checks each player making sure they're attuned and of the required level. Last I checked, every single spec can zone in to raids and attack mobs.
---
My guess is that your definition of "raid-viable" is similar to your definition of "good" -- i.e. narrowly catered to min/maxing guilds, ignoring all other play styles (including those with no intention of ever raiding).
---
&gt; To make the most of something stupid you don't need any support at all, you can do it all by yourself.
---
I'm guessing you think playing a meme spec is "stupid" because meme specs are "bad." More of this stubborn nerd intransigence again.
---
&gt; I think you are being deliberately obtuse. Someone not pulling their weight is sucking in the sense I obviously intended, regardless of whether they are not pulling their weight because they are bad at hitting buttons or because they are good at hitting buttons but are self-indulgently playing a snowflake spec in a collective gear-based enterprise.
---
No, I'm not being deliberately obtuse. I'm just saying things that contradict your point of view.
---
It's up to _each and every_ guild to determine what "pulling your weight" means for each player. For a casual raiding guild, that might mean showing up reliably on time with decent gear and consumables. For a hardcore guild, that might mean having to heal. That _was_ a decision that every hybrid player made in Vanilla's endgame. So... want to play a balance druid? Find a guild whose definition of "pulling your weight" accommodates hybrid DPS specs, and then play that boomkin to the best of your ability. That may be 500 DPS for you, and it might be 1200 DPS for the mage next to you, but you're going to have to find a way to calm your ego down and be proud that you played your spec to its potential.
---
Install finished at midnight. I couldn’t stop playing but eventually did at 4pm. Next day at school friends told me nightelf was lame and to reroll horde 
---
T2 gloves prevent disarm
---
ding, ding, ding!
---
Can we add Char/Toon to this list? the word "toon" offends me
---
Even if it's fairly close I reckon it'll bring a heap of players back.
---
Quite possibly!
---
Np, the little changes and no database yet makes it impossible to choose a class.
---
All I'm gonna say is this...
---
For those of you who rush to 60 without gearing your toon, don't expect dungeon invites and to be carried through the higher instances while you do level 40-ish damage.
---
People run these dungeons to gear their toons, but your lack of caring for your class by not gearing up through SM, ST, LBRS and a few others puts you at a disadvantage.  You can't carry your weight with the group, and that's not going to fly with a lot of people.
---
So while you are leveling, do the dungeons for your blue items, your blue boss drops, and quest rewards.  Many of those dungeon drops and blue quest-reward items LAST YOU until 56-58.
---
And do not expect to tank and/or do a Dire Maul run unless you have some gear from the dungeons.  I am sick and tired of trying to keep a (he thinks) fury warrior alive with level 35 / 45 gear off the AH during the Tribute fight where the boss can and will one-shot you.
---
Yea and the Battlegroups used to have a mixture of all realm types, PvP, PvE, RP and RPPvP. I was on EU-Cyclone battlegroup on the realm Stormscale, and I remember the RP realm Earthern Ring was definitely in it
---
&gt;just a fyi if it helps, vanilla wow released with 8 debuffs but around patch 1.17 I believe, it got moved up to 16 debuffs. Or something like that.  I was hoping they'd allow 24 debuffs personally.
---
Cause I want to?
---
Another important aspect is that your gear upgrades from dungeons may just be what lets you win the pvp battle later and saves you 10 minutes of walking to corpse and getting camped.
---
Who that
---
A good community and some ninja looters aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
First time was in june 2006. I used the free trial and started a Tauren warrior. Played a couple of hours to lvl4-5 then I found how to open the world map.
---
Seeing the little dot I (me) and how small the area I played for hours (starting camp) was ... I could'nt believe it and I knew at this very moment that it was the beginning of a fantastic journey. Gosh I want to go back to that moment and enjoy that feeling again ...
---
&gt; It just is not remotely going to be the problem you think it is.
---
It's crazy being old enough to be told the exact same thing about predictably destructive things a second time around. People like you were defending the stupid shit they implemented late in Vanilla and in TBC, Wrath, and Cata and always used that stupid line. 
---
you sound like you want to play old school runescape lol, sorta like classic for runescape, lots of nerds doing maths on best xp methods over there too :P
---
Classic community was not necessarily great. Rather, there was an actual community present in Classic.
