Well then that bot needs to learn its place.
---
---
---
Thanks for the reassurance! I guess when I look back to vanilla when I levelled on a normal pop pvp server it can't have been bad because I still remember specific pvp incidents. Right now, playing on a high pop private server they're just blurring into a perpetual multi-zone gank.
---
My guild on our pserver is currently the most Naxx progressed guild on our faction, full Naxx clear, obviously very hardcore.
---

---
But we don't get every single wbuff every time. BL buffs, DM buffs, and DMF buffs (when available) are a must, and the core consumes are a must... but beyond that it's still optional.
---
People get songflower too... that's just so insanely tryhard imo and you start running out of buff duration!
---
When we farm MC we don't even bother with *any* world buffs.
---
It's a mixed bag. They're there for those who will use it. A good "payoff" for those willing to invest the time into it as a team. I don't think it's as unhealthy as some people make it seem, as long as it's content gated (which seems like it will be the case after the last blue post.)
---
Great in BG's yes.
---
Great in big fights no.
---
It does. But it gives a ton of threat to the tanks. The hateful strike was based off health, not threat. It hits whatever player has the most hit points aside from the primary target. Which is why you tank him near the poison so the dps can take a dip if their health is too high.
---
Not me for sure
---
We don't really know but there will be plenty of addons to fix stuff like this 100%.
---
I think the custom is to give two weeks notice. 
---
It got married and has three kids? That's what I call a successful monitor.
---
&gt; He'll be "the" boss for quite a while
---
No he won't. He'll be dead by the end of week 2 at the earliest and by week 3 at the latest. People aren't going to stumble for months finding how to douse runes to summon him or get a strategy to beat him.
---
I don't disagree but the question of importance is exactly what to fill the cracks. 
---
&gt; At any rate I'd imagine launching new clients/servers in any progression they want down the line would be effortless for them given their 14 years of MMORPG experience they now have.
---
I think the specific experience they need for this policy is from the last two years as they made WoW Classic and realized that they really should have saved their work.
---
Rolling ignite was a bug. Which is why I mentioned it may not be in the game. Maybe it will be. We'll have to see!
---
Okay what about lack of taunt and having zero raid itemization?
---
While I believe some skills can be rebalanced without losing the vanilla feel or overpowering a class I can’t see them making changes like this. They’ve said they’re going to stay away from changing the code.
---
Not to mention the reckoning change would pretty much ruin pvp reckoning paladins which is one of their most iconic builds. 
---
There are also some fun mechanics that have been played with over the years on private servers that could almost be seen as a bug or unintended in blizzards eyes. While they’re rebalancing skills like that they could very well “fix” issues like spell damage scaling on procs, or start nerfing engineering and alchemy potions because they’re way more game changing than originally intended. God help us if they start changing things like that. 
---
it potentially wouldn't be that hard to allow some certain capabilities that were available in vanilla, depending on how they've structured it.
---
...they're making a fresh GAME for us right now!
---
1. They still don’t have a taunt
---
2. They still don’t have gear 
---
3. Protadin is already viable. They can tank any dungeon and some of the lower level raids.  After that, they drop off in favor for Druid OT or Warrior MT. 
---
Nothing wrong with that. Almost every spec has its place and few of them are great overall in both PvP and PvE.
---
Just accept paladins as they are and you can begin to enjoy the “balance” of Vanilla. If you want homogenized Holy Warriors, just hold out for TBC Classic or try BFA.
---
that's easy 
---
war.....riors :]
---
How about instead of us all talking about what is better what is worse, let us pick? 1k capped servers, 2.5k capped servers, 5k capped servers, 7.5k? capped servers.
---
If they leave item stats in their previous state then you run the risk of invalidating diremaul items making the delay seem pointless.
---
&gt; Those against changes like this under the argument “but it wouldn’t be classic anymore,” by all means feel free to provide a valid reason for your belief.
---
So folks wanting a best-effort recreation of classic as it was are wrong? That reason in-and-of-itself is wrong? I don't get what you're fishing for here.
---
There are loads of ways to balance classes/specs. The argument has never been about *how* to balance them -- it's *should* they be balanced. 
---
I would be fine with an extra popup that asks "Are you certain you want to give [Item] to [Player]"
---
Well that would be changing how paladin works, both talents and skills, it would be a complete rework. Why do you feel like prot paladins needs to be viable ? 
---
Ok cool you fixed pallies (you actually didn't btw, they got 10 significant buffs in TBC and still weren't as good as warrior for raid tanking). Now what about shadow priest dps, ret dps, hunter scaling, warlock dot playstyle, hots not stacking, ridiculous warrior rage generation, 1 button raiding rotations etc etc.  
---
  
---
Why did you just pick prot pally and decide that was a necessary change but all the other broken stuff in vanilla is completely fine?
---
Did you end up with that SO?
---
My CRT got disposed of by my mother like a decade ago, it's actually a shame because the image quality was real crisp and the response was better than anything since, though the colours looked washed out compared to newer screens.
---
But with that said, the thing was only 17 inches and it was fucking massive, I don't even know where I'd put it. I'm not on board with the "lets take a Pentium 4 PC and a 17 inch CRT from 1998 and roleplay that 2005 vanilla wow experience".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Embrace the technology... Though with that said, old consoles look a lot better on old TV's.
---
Pretty sure this is a multi press macro. The charge will succeed on subsequent presses.  
---
This is actually a pretty good solution. I like it.
---
But that guy back there is a dwarf priest.
---
I need more information about this if you will.  
---
pfUI has a successfully working focus functionality in vanilla?  
---
I need to do this so badly. 
---
It was pretty fucking stupid to make one class a "hero class" though. 
---
On the item gating vs progressive itemization
---
I am very upset they're not doing real progressive item stats. There are still 1.10 dungeon gear that makes diremaul and MC items irrelevant.
---
Lol I didn’t even see that guy. NE hunter on the right. 
---

**&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance** 
---
**Introduction:** 
---
We are a casual raiding guild built from a core of WoW veterans. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. Our leadership has previously led other guilds to great successes, and have raided at an extremely high level in retail. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, while competing with the best guilds in the world is unlikely, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible. If you're an adult, have a limited schedule, and are good a video games, then this is the guild for you.  
---
**Expectations:** 
---
We expect that all members put in the work that is necessary in learning their classes, and understanding all raid encounters prior to entering the raid. While we are not a hardcore guild, we still expect every member of the raid to preform well above average and come to all raids with the appropriate enchants, consumables, etc.. We are a close knit diverse guild with members spanning all across North America and we expect that new members only add to our already friendly community. All members must be respectful to others and work towards helping the guild rather then hurting it. No member is better then another. We are a team, and any bullshit will be handled with a gkick.  
---
**Looking For:**  
---
We are currently looking for players of any class that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at a level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be. In terms of particular classes, our preference would certainly be to recruit the most optimal class/spec for the role; however, we are much more concerned with the player behind the class and will take the less wanted specs into consideration, yes even ret. It's important to note that this is a fresh guild that is also looking to add to our officer core. We are looking for experienced leadership members that can bring unique ideas and help our guild towards the goal of clearing Naxx.  
---
**Looting Policies:** 
---
We will be using a fair and transparent loot council system for all 40man raids. A set number of individuals from within the guild leadership team will take on the role of the council. The council will distribute the loot based on the following factors: 
---
1. Role Priorities 
---
2. Main Item Role 
---
3. Upgrade Size 
---
4. Future Needs
---
5. Member Contribution  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Friday - Evening Sunday - Afternoon/Evening  We are still in the process of setting raid times; however, we have committed to Friday as our main raid, and Sunday as a spare day during progression. It's very likely that we will select evening hours for each raid day. 
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and all necessary raid attunements are met.

When one of pservers rolled fresh not so long ago there was no sharding. They actually had dynamic respawns based on amount of players, groups and whatnot in vicinity. Even that wasn't enough for Barrens to pretty much have no living centaur. Having much smaller realm pop will help if it will be actually smaller than &gt;=4k
---
Preach 
---
Is this BFA's road map for the next year?
---
&gt; **World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.7.0 (2005-09-13)**  
---
&gt; Using /random will now send the text to your party or raid wherever they are instead of the local area around the player that used /random.
---
Can't expect a hunter not to shoot at stuff.
---
This made me cringe so hard I almost threw up. 
---
All of them. Cheap shitty ones, but they are there. 
---
I like gnomes. Gnomes are awesome. I'm choosing gnome.  
---
depends. do you like gold? if so, go Warlock. basically free mount. If you hate gold and wanna respec all the time. Go Shaman
---
End of week 2? Idk about that. 
---
It will take around 8 days played to get to 60. Not including getting tank sets for the warriors. I’d say he dies week 4. 
---
Nefarian will drop the day BWL opens. 
---
&gt; Making prot pally viable is easy  
---
Yes it is, go play BFA and they're viable.  
---
Could you est the time to do the entire map for classic?
---
I'm fkn seething to see this sub be so fkn pro sharding with arguments like "but it's only for the first few days/weeks/zones".
---
Or people who complain and admit they would be one of the stupid ones to stand around and wait for camped mob spawns for hours. JUST MOVE ON. That's how a launch of wow is supposed to be. If you wanna keep lvling, just move the fuck on, do another quest or grind mobs if you have to. 
---
If you want to do every single quest then there's going to be plenty of time. The zerg only lasts for a few weeks so you can always come back and lvl another char.
---
Fuck calling this game Classic World of Warcraft if it's going to include sharding and all this shit. Shit should be named WoW:Remastered or sumshit.
---
Isn’t that part of Durotar more so than Valley of Trials
---
Agreed. The only thing that will really make you obviously not a full resto shaman is that extra mana totem, so most people likely won't notice.
---
the size of the screen doesnt matter, its the resolution and aspect ratio :)
---
You really think you could just about double the pop of a server without having the change spawn rates? Change those and you  change the economy. Change that and mess with every other part of how people play. #nochanges is a meme but can we at least push for #fewestchanges? Server pops were not a problem before why fix what isn't broken
---
No, it sounds to me like everyone else is an arsehole.
---
All I did was point out that I have a differing opinion and everyone goes off at me. 
---
Nat Pagle says that fishing is fer sissies.
---
This is becoming a cringey meme at this point.   
---
Yeah, i still have my 17" crt, but i'm no Luddite....
---
I was already 30 when i started playing wow in spring of 2005... so i suppose the childhood nostalgia isn't really there for me... i love the technological improvements that have happened since then and i'm in no hurry to return to the dark ages &gt;_&lt;
---
The best theory that I have heard is a little convoluted but it seems reasonable and suggests that July 16th is release day.  I don't have the source post for that theory though.
---
Gnomes are one I don’t know too much lore about outside of they would spend all they’re time in Gnomeragan building gadgets and what not.
---
My old Hunter basic one was

---
/cast Pet Attack
---
If you want to min/max PvE then engineering, but as a mage if you aren't going hardcore then not really needed.
---
For engineering/something for endgame professions you would start with mining/skinning at leveling, stash mining results on bank alts (and some leather by the end too). When you reach 60 or close to it you drop skinning for Engineering (you can stash some skin that can be used to train Engi). Craft whatever you need from engineering and then think about dropping mining. If you stashed cloth on alts then engin/tailoring is an option. You can make money as a mage from farming ads, fishing and selling bags and rare/rep gated tailoring crafting fees. As mentioned by others - tailoring doesn't have to be a permanent profession.
---
But if you can pass on engi then if you want alchemy then you go skinning/herbalism and if not likely skinning/mining and decide what to stash and what to vendor (skinning or more). You can stash mining mats, then start engi and craft as much green guns as you have mats, drop engi pick enchanting and DE all of it, then pick tailoring as second profession and do similarly with stashed cloth. You end up with classic enchanting/tailoring on a cloth caster. Not really a PvP config nor an easy gold maker. Enchanting rely on rare or raid recipes as well as standing in city and selling services (plus oils and mats selling).
---
Alchemy/herbalism/fishing is a strong money making combo and can supply you with many custom consumables. Free action potions are worth a fortune in PvE and PvP overall and that's just one thing.
---
Not to mention that you can level an alt to some degree and have some professions on him as a synergy with main. Or rely on the help of guildies.
---
NO LOOT TRADING!!
---
Gnomes were once robots corrupted by the curse of flesh.  That makes them the best.
---
What makes you think there were stealth nerfs? Surely there's some sort of evidence. Am I supposed to sign on to this currently baseless claim?
---
&gt; As the Cynical Brit, Totalbiscuit once said... **STOP. PUGGING.** 
---
Yeah. Nothing wrong with loot trading. Just throws a whole social interaction out of the window.
---
&gt; You're going to have nothing but a bad time when grouping with random players 
---
Dude, don't talk to other like they have not played the game once upoin a time back in 2005. It really destroys every points you're trying to make.
---
I mostly PuGed in Vanilla. So do many, many, MANY other players. I want to do the same in Classic. No loot trading. Simple. This is a much higher problem than a few people missclicking. You can't refute that.
---
Yeh so how about a ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GIVE (ITEM NAME) TO (PLAYER NAME)
---
Lmao
---
I trust them also to shard big cities, BRM, EPL on launch of SotN. Especially AQ opening will have to be sharded because of too many people. /s
---
I've started to hate this sub. What the fuck happened to Classic being similar to vanilla? This is WoW: Remastered and has less and less, the more I read from official statements, to do with vanilla.
---
Hell to the no.
---
:)
---
According to logs warriors aren't that special after BWL though so unless if you want to constantly change your guild roster that won't work well. 
---
I dont think they will get rid of it, but I think we can make it better. Everyone who is tied to the instance ID the item was looted from should get an automated whisper and in game mail notifying them which item was traded, and who traded it. This would fix everything.
---
What was it with the 2000’s and long hair? 
---
Yeah, it did happen, I am just saying that it wasn't common place.  It required a core group of geared players essentially opening it up to pugs after they had filled critical roles.
---
None is playing 18 hours a day to get "respect" we don't do it for you we don't give a fuck what you think. 
---
I mean, you shouldn't gimp yourself with garbage gear, and some fights you'd prioritize something else, but it should be available by the time you're in BWL and it should be automatic for warriors by the time you finish BWL.
---
Even without MCPs Bear threat is higher than Warriors. However a warrior can dual wield tank and that brings their threats to about equal 
---
about to run off to work, but just leaving this here for reference as I plan to finish this off over a few hours later tonight.
---
You’re cynical and an idiot. 
---
I've probably invested about 9 hours into 3-4 zones.
---
Probably a few months if I want it to be good, not rushed work,
---
which it will be, hopefully I can stick it all together on one huge map!
---
Also the clear front runner for farming. If you're farming elementals for instance, Put your pet on aggressive and they will run towards the mobs before they spawn and tag them with their instant cast.
---
Hateful Strikes Don't Crit if I recall correctly, even back in the day.
---
Just move on? Move on to what? The next set of camped mobs so you can move on again? Do you understand how busy it very well might be?
---
World of Movingoncraft: Classic
---
Don’t underestimate no-lifers. Back in the day, no lifers didn’t get any attention or revenue; now, they’ll be live-streaming to their followers. They are more incentivized than ever to speed through all of the content.
---
 If MC isn’t cleared in 20 days from launch I’d be shocked.
---
I'm an episode behind and playing catchup. Cant wait for this one though.
---
The trolls where here in da beginning mon.
---
Idk, I’ve always really liked the trolls in wow. I like their tribalism and Jamaican accents.
---
But I’ll probably end up recreating my female orc shaman from vanilla.
---
Tailoring simply for the Bloodvine set when it is released.
---
Lol CRTs are for Melee and nothing else!
---
From the chat: “Where are you Athleon?” I can only hope they wrote that because of the pure chaos that is vanilla raiding 
---
Paradise. 
---
does the casting bar not indicate what was being learned?
---
As everyone has stated already. Generally if you are tanking, you are off tanking. That isn;t to say you cannot MT, but geneerally speaking warrirors are better MTs for many fights. And thats fine.
---
As a dedicated off tank you will:
---
* Do more dps than a prot OT when you need to dps
---
* Take less dmg than a fury warrior who has to OT a fight
---
* Can Heal fights
---
* Can Decurse
---
* Intervate and Battle rez
---
* When tanking will generally have much higher threat than a similarly geared warrior(assuming the warrior isn't DW tanking)
---
Yeah I really don't understand how everyone thinks sharding is a good idea. Its one of the worst aspects of current wow and people want it in classic.
---
I'd rather wait on a quest mob for 4 hours if it meant there wouldn't be sharding.
---
Warrior will be far and away the most popular class. I'm not worried about tanks.
---
Did I miss something where is this post from blizzard?
---
Also couldn't that mean everyone just runs master looter and ninjas on demand now?
---
The more I look at it the weirder it gets
---
First of all, don't call us "Hordies".
---
Secondly, I love the maps, keep them coming!
---
Sadly I think loot trading will be staying. But since that's probably the case, they should implement a system where anytime an item is traded, all players tied to the raid ID the item was looted from will get both a whisper, and an ingame piece of mail telling them who traded what and when. This would help the community police itself when shitty players act shitty.
---
i leveled as DW once on a pserver. It actually went quite smoothly as a human.
---
just spec fury but the only difference picking up some points in DW spec.
---
Fucking dragons are no joke. 
---
Not just the bosses. But the casters, and the whelps too
---
Late response. Depending on the synergy of the class. For instance I am running a War with my friend playing Shammy. Not only are we both dealing damage thus killing mobs faster, I don't have to sit and eat, I take most of the hits so he only has to heal me. So not only are we killing faster we also have zero downtime, and I can pull 2-4 mobs at a time depending. Its more than double the speed of me or him alone.
---
Amazing! Any way you can do Deathknell? (Undead starting zone) It's my favorite!!
---
All you saw was the yellow flash that occurred when they learned a new recipe.
---
I think it’s less of the wow community and more just gaming in general. People want to win. Any advantage and usually they will take it. And to be honest, I don’t blame them. If it’s within the rules and they’re not technically cheating, then it’s just a strategic move. My issue lies with Blizzard not foreseeing how it could be abused and not implementing it in a better way (or not at all).
---
“You’re cynical and an idiot.”
---
There is your answer, GrouseONE.  This sub is being taken over by the retail “wall of no” people - who demand things to be the way they want - and look what they did to modern WoW. 
---
They are more interested in getting their way (e.,g., with sharding) than getting the authentic experience of Vanilla WoW.
---
I want the game to just progress to BC and then Wrath. I don’t see why anybody would want perpetual 1.12 with all content unlocked and everybody in full Naxx gear. Sounds like a dead server after a while. 
---
2500 is perfect. Anything higher ruins the entire experience.
---
No
---
I know the "purists" will disagree, but I would love to see a classic server with more viable specs. The only reason I could see anyone saying they **don't** want it is because they are scared the devs will fuck it up and make things OP. 
---
To me, so long as the changes don't make say prot paladin the best tank, then all that really changes is you have more viable off tank options, which doesn't sound horrible. But I do understand people not having faith in Blizzard to properly balance those things.
---
&gt; You could log on at anytime of the day and find a group to run endgame PvE.
---
Sounds awful, no matter what time I play everything is camped to hell.
---
2500 or bust.
---
Just replying to say Rest In Peace. I hope you’re doing well. Cya in Azeroth 
---
I mean I don't even necessarily agree with OPs changes but you are being ridiculous. Someone should not have to outline how to fix every single problem with classic (and yes, unviable specs are a **problem**) to outline potential fixes for one thing.
---
Pally tank should not ever be made viable.  I don't care how easy or difficult it hypothetically would be.
---
Could not agree more. I tried a private server and every spot was contested and I thought "This isn't what I remember at all".
---
Why do you feel they don't?
---
that'd be terrible. Friends can easily roll on stuff they don't really need then secretly trade to each other. 
---
They can allow as many people as they want in a shard. Could be 100. Could be 30. It could depend on the zone.
---
I'm sure the ideal would be something like: sharding in beginner areas to make it feel full, but not ridiculously over populated.
---
On a private server launches are a *dasaster*. You may have 1 named mob that everyone needs, and 300 people bottlenecked at this quest tab+1ing repeatedly to get it. It's really awful.
---
private server babies plz go
---
After playing on a busy server in retail vanilla, and now on some private servers, 10-15k is way way too many people. However, 2500 was also not great. It ment that if your regular play times weren't peak times, you'd never find a group for anything. I think 4000-4500 would be optimal for vanilla. However my only concern is if we ever get a TBC or WotLK classic. These expansions weren't built for a server pop of 4500. I think they should start with 4000-4500 in classic, and then IF we ever get a TBC, they can quietly lower the server caps back to say 3k.
---
&gt; . Yes, it's no longer a new game, but it feels like many on this subreddit gets "circle-jerked" into believing there won't be any noobs playing because everyone knows everything. W
---
It's just private server babies who have no idea what they're talking about.
---
Warlock
---
30/0/21 SM/Ruin is great in PvP and PvE. Warlocks level well, are not too gear dependent to be good in PvP. 
---
While 30/0/21 Ele/Resto for Shaman is good, it requires 2 sets of gear to dps and heal. If you want less gear to worry about Warlock all the way.
---
However if you don't mind getting a little bit of gear I think a 31/0/21 Shaman would be a boon to any PvP team, decent dmg/burst, and decent heals, hard to want more from a player
---
The WoW Diary, as I interpreted it, mentioned this Hero Class concept as the original blueprint for WoW.  Blizzard wanted you to be able to play your favorite heros etc.
---
It’s such a better name. It took me a while to used to classicwow 
---
You mean optimal, you really only mean optimal instead of viable. They are completely viable all the way through all content as offtank, they are in no way optimal but they are fully viable.
---
Sneaky bastard
---
You don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry but I'm not even going to properly reply to your nonsense. 
---
Inverse: Water Totem Quest
---
Gnomes are the least lore talked about race other than Goblins. Basically the Titans forged an army to fight the Old Gods on Azeroth to purify her because they were so enormous any attempt they made to remove the Old Gods also injured Azeroth. So they made an army much smaller like Odyn, Lokken, Tyrion and Mimiron (I'm sure there are more) who said fuck all this mess we will also make smaller things to do our work and Mimiron made dwarves and gnomes known as Earthen and something else for gnomes and both got the curse of flesh and then took on the names dwarves and gnomes and forgot their linage.              
---
             
---
Dwarves went on to do a ton of shit, gnomes didnt do much of anything besides get their asses kicked by troggs and then one crazy fucker decided to gas every one.

---
The post specifically says that they are going to be holding off on putting those 1.10 items in the loot table until that stage.
---
No I didn't go out of my way and waste a bag slot on a crap recipe on the off chance I could be a shit fuck.
---
Yep, obvious private server babies spamming to make classic like their shitty private servers instead of an ACTUAL classic wow experience.
---
Private server babies plz go
---
Couldn't agree more, this is literally history repeating itself. Casual retail players whining endlessly to change the game to be a lfg/pug simulator of playing with npcs and not a small tight-nit community of people who all know eachother.
---
Can these people just stop? I would prefer if the game wasn't ruined twice in a row by their rampant crying.
---
Huh? Are you suggesting we should do passes over all classes and mechanics to fix these things in Vanilla? Because if you do that what you end up with clearly isn't anything like vanilla. It would be pretty close to the 2.0 pre patch vanilla, but no content was ever made or balanced for 60 for that so most people wouldn't call that vanilla.
---
Recently checked out all the casting animations. F dwarf wins.
---
&gt;  but I would love to see a classic server with more viable specs
---
every spec in the game is viable and great at something, unless you're talking RAIDS specifically. I'd love some arms warrior and elemental shaman buffs!
---
No? I'm just suggesting that its completely ok for someone to have an idea to make qol changes for one aspect of the game...
---
History is literally repeating itself, and I don't understand why.
---
I see why my teachers for history always told me history is so important.
---
Woot!!
---
Oh, right, free pool party after.
---
^^ This guy gnows what's up 
---
&gt;  unviable specs are a problem
---
how would you suggest buffing Arms warriors?
---
Well I guess I should probabaly clarify that I am absolutely talking about raids when talking about viability.
---
There are still items in the game at launch that get buffed in 1.10 that become better than what's available before that
---
Get the fire resist buff from LBRS before joining BWL and you should be fine (assuming you don't die from Vael or supression room) tooooooooooo
---
There's two perfectly fine ways to deal with this and the problem is which one you pick.
---
A) Everyone needs. Everyone benefits equally from the gold that Edgemaster gives. Literally, the warrior saves say 1000 gold, but everyone else gain 1000 gold for winning. So everyone gets the same with the same chance.
---
B) Warriors gets it and equips it, because it is his class or whatever.
---
I pref option A) because option B is kinda wacky. What about rightous orbs? If I have brilliant shards and a enchanter does that mean I get priority on orbs? Hell no. 
---
Coming from someone that has a fascination with WoW and no game has ever held my attention post-WoW, Josh’s podcasts have made me analyze the game in a way I never had before. Such a though provoking podcast and he’s just my favorite interviewer. 
---
Some classes you can go 4 to 6 levels before going back to buy spells. Having a bank alt is a great way to hold patterns you find that you want to later use. Or cloth you want to hold on for later to level up your bandages. Or things you know will sell well later, or even gear you find that you want to gift to an alt. If you're a skinner, it's the best way to keep your leveling bags empty while also making maximum profit while leveling.
---
If you're going herbalism, send yourself all that dreamfoil you find and save it for when the economy starts roaring and you can make thousands.
---
How the hell should I know? I'm not a game designer or on a game balance team, nor have I or do I intend on playing a warrior at all for classic.
---
I'm like 99% set on resto shaman
---
Its only cringey if you never experienced the wonders of the CRT life.
---
I’d love to see some of the really atmospheric ones like your interpretation of duskwood or ungoro 
---
Rok is better than bloodseeker though and it will take fucking forever to get xbow, most hunters will end up using bows more than they do xbows just because of that.
---
Very tiny? It's 3% hit.
---
This is basically +9 damage scope at the very worst.
---
Perfectly implemented sharding &gt; no sharding at all &gt; shit sharding
---
This is obviously the first section of the yeti cave in Feralas.
---
Same. I am fascinated with WoW, and no other game has ever held my attention post-WoW. Josh’s podcast has made me analyze the game like I never have before. It’s such a thought provoking podcast and he asks the best questions. Couldn’t thank him enough for this podcast. 
---
I want to know if the Countdown to Classic community is planning on playing on the same server together. I’d love to play with people like Ayle, Orcbit, North, Taladril, all of them. 
---
it’s really hard to predict how many players will play, so we don’t really know what blizzard plans. There should be plenty of people around though. It definitely wouldn’t be you and five other people; itd be a lot more 
---
No. Just no. 
---
that leads you down a very weird path of buffing some of the absolute best specs in the game. thankfully no one plays a spec in vanilla they play the full class
---
I don’t know what is so hard to follow. If you fix one spec, you have to fix all specs. If you fix all specs, you no longer have vanilla. The point of Classic is to recreate vanilla. Therefore small qol changes to one spec don’t make any sense for Classic.
---
Ask your employer/HR if you can have a month longer to decide. If not take every Thurs/Friday off from July onward.
---
I used to do this all the time when I did AQ20 for the books ;)
---
It depends on how the items changed over time.
---
I’ve done enough software engineering to know that sometimes you make decisions that are well thought out and academic...and other times, you just make the shit work and pretend you’ll come back one day to improve it.
---
In the case of Blizzard’s itemization, if they copied the old version of the item, changed the stats on the copy, then reference only the copy moving forward, then they could conceivably still have stats prior to the final version. It’s also conceivable that a dev could just run an update statement and boost stat values during Tuesday maintenance. If they did that, there’s no going back - especially since this entire game is based off a single random backup.
---
First of all, congratulations on being able to defeat Ragnaros.
---
It doesn't matter how long it takes to kill him, he's still the final boss (aka "the" boss) until BWL.
---
I was reading the staff from the Mauradon quest (opposed to the thrash blade) was a nasty 2h for a warrior or enhance shaman.
---
Thunder Bluff is easily the best city for bank alts. The distance between the mailbox and the auctioneer is the lowest in the game.
---
DW fury prot definitely generates more threat than a druid
---
That's not true at all.
---
Jason mamoa looks terrible here
---
No they need the space to promote the mod's podcast... -_-
---
&gt; The fact that the guy's rotation is completely incorrect is not an emotional caricature, it's a fact.
---
Extrapolating from it that everyone in the raid was working at 33% efficiency is the caricature.
---
&gt; There's also the fact that pretty much every Vanilla PvE video (including videos from the best raiding guilds) features people who are doing things very wrong.
---
Like I said, if you approach it the way deniers approach moon landing videos you can find things to mock. But I do wonder how much of it is due to a lack of understanding on the part of the viewer - there's this one video of a priest healing on C'thun that idiot pirate server kids keep trying to make fun of while showing how little they know about raid healing.
---
But as I said, *I* was getting this stuff right by 2006, and I was nothing like in the top 1%.
---
&gt; If you're limiting your argument to MC speedruns, you should address the fact that there don't seem to be any MC videos from retail Vanilla where the raid is actually going hardcore in regards to buffs and raid composition (as in doing an actual speedrun by optimizing performance, not just spending less time pissing around and calling it a speedrun). Do you have any videos like that?
---
No, but if I'm not the one claiming 300% better performance by mashing the same frostbolt key.
---
Vaniller 
---
relax
---
no one 
---
If master looter is on, it tells you when you join the instance. It’s normally used for organized raid runs, guild or trustworthy pugs.
---
If you have an organized group and you’re still getting underhanded tactics, that’s the fault of the organizer.
---
throw that shit away mate. don’t be a nasty hoarder. 
---
+ Sharding, Automated Squelch from right click Report, and Itemization all have to be addressed.
---
Seems like you've already accomplished that goal though?
---
On many Pservers you learn the riding skill level with acquiring the class mount. Idk about vanilla or classic though.
---
It shows you the loot rules the second you enter the instance. In the case of 5 mans, if you walk in and see “Master Looter,” you just keyboard turn and walk out.
---
Go back to private servers
---
Ma man
---
I hear you can make 40-50g per hour farming Mara. Does that increase with enchanting?
---
Remember reach
---
I got mine in wrath on my DK on my 9th run but one thing for sure i will hunt this bad boy down when classic comes out. Will be rolling alliance to make it extra sweet if i get this.
---
A- "LF1M Strat need tank"
---
B- "Oh hey man just logged on. Cool you wanna run undead side again?"
---
A- "But...Tyrellius. You...you changed your grey flattop haircut to long blonde hair. I--I don't even fucking know you any more. You're like a stranger to me now."
---
B- "lol wut? C'mon dude invite me I just respecced to prot."
---
A- "Im sorry. I don't think I can do any more dungeons with someone who's shattered my trust as you have. Have a good rest of your life."
---
People seem to love inventing weird problems on this subreddit.
---
Those are pretty bad ideas. One of the reason the TBC rework was good was that they fleshed out the roles WHILE ALSO maintaining distinct identities. Take paladin tanks, what you want to do is basically make a talent the same as warriors. However, look what TBC did, rather than a flat increase, they moved Redoubt to a chance on hit instead of a chance on crit, which made more sense for the tanking role where you were stacking +def. This version of redoubt plays into the paladin identity of AoE tanking, where more mobs means more hits means more chance to keep redoubt procced. 
---
Fucking quilboars
---
I'd really appreciate a PM also!! 😊
---
now you're trolling
---
Looking for a semi-serious alliance guild on a PVP NA server with raids times starting around 7:00pm PST and going until whenever. Interested in a mixture of both PVE and PVP content. 
---
I joined the game during BC clearing ST/TK/ Hyjal and doing early BT before quitting until WotLK. During which I raided hardcore completely clearing Ulduar, but unfortunately my guild imploded and I couldn't be bothered to find another, so I messed around casually up through ICC after which I quit the game entirely. 
---
I have private server experience up to BWL. 
---
Going to be crushing it to 60 within the first two weeks after launch and would like to have fun doing early dungeons with a good group of friends that will continue well into pre-raid farming and endgame content. Really want to stress the friend farm aspect as I thoroughly enjoy helping my buddies get the items/gear they need even if the dungeon/area has nothing of value for me; I want that guildy experience that I haven't had in a long time!
---
Currently I am flouting the idea of leveling a warrior, so making some friends early will definitely help the leveling process! If any of this piques your interest feel free to send me a PM and we can move to other platforms from there. Thanks!
---
Hey OP why did you delete your [previous post](https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0exz0/_/) and reposted it?
---
Can you find me the patch notes for those nerfs you speak of? The only ones I found were bugfices and a buff to Rag. Do you want players to fight pre-fix C’thun with tentacles spawning in the stomach?
---
PvP more, I think. In vanilla, I saw BGs, wPvP, and dueling as more of a mini game or annoyance when I was young and obsessed with pushing raid progression... and I was a Rogue. 
---
Thats greheheheasy lol. Gonna have to remember that one.
---
Boars can eat any food. Bears don't eat fruit or mushrooms I think 
---
I don’t disagree entirely. I think they are completely going to be level 60 within 2 weeks and farming for gear, but I don’t think MC will be cleared.
---
You would need 40 of them to be organized with viable classes and they all need to be skilled since they will most likely be wearing mostly greens and some blues when they enter MC. 
---
I’m assuming there will be many guilds that are full no lifers, but I still bet it’ll take 4 weeks. Maybe I’ll add a remind me to this post lol. 
---
Some examples from just one patch
---
&gt;Onyxia's fireballs will no longer result in a confuse effect (Engulfing Flames)
---
&gt;Baroness Anastasi in Stratholme will now leave the possessed target when the target is below 50% health, instead of 30%.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0
---
Define "often." Post a source for frequency. 
---
Kinda douchey imo. Sounds like ninja looting with extra steps. 
---
Currently, it seems like that's what they plan to do. Obviously they could decide to do it differently.
---
Thank you very much for that info, I did not know. 
---
Yes, you need to have DM for the last parts of the Warlock and Paladin epic mount questlines. 
---
This map puts my mind at ease for some reason lol.
---
Well now you know how to trick people into not kicking you after saying you will learn a rare recipe, and don't.
---
Yeah, I think they're still trying to figure out what to do with the PvP system, especially the rewards.
---
I'm hoping they include the updated blue set in an early patch, such as Dire Maul, but exclude the updated epic PvP set until AQ.
---
It's a good money maker! Or when you just want to help out that Blacksmith in your guild when Arcanite Reaper Pattern drops \^.\^
---
&gt;If you fix one spec, you have to fix all specs.
---
First of all, no you don't. Second of all, that is irrelevant to the actual post at hand. This is what you initially said that I disagreed with:
---
&gt;Why did you just pick prot pally and decide that was a necessary change but all the other broken stuff in vanilla is completely fine?
---
This isn't about "class balance as a whole" or what should or should not actually be changed, its about the fact that you think someone should not be able to recommend **any** change unless they also recommend a way to change **everything at once**. That is, frankly, a moronic view point. There is no topic **in the world**, where one reddit post could actually cover all of the things that could or should be changed, so basically you were just being a dick for no reason, I called you on it, and now you're moving the goal posts of the argument at hand.
---
Like, honestly, I don't understand half the people in this subreddit. Its like you get so worked up over one thing you let that same thing infiltrate your posts where it isn't even related to the actual topic.
---
Or you could, ya know... not lie and greed on the pattern like everyone else if you can't use it? 
---
Can we just skip ahead a year or whatever, when everyone has requested these amazing pieces for every zone in the game and you've merged them all into one breathtaking canvas that we'll all pay several hundred dollars for?
---
It’s not 50% of the people who paid *for* Classic. Most of the population that doesn’t spend the 3-5 hours to get to 10 will be from retail. It’s not elitist, I just don’t think the slower pace will be what a lot of the “tourists” are comfortable with. 
---
I do think it’s a bad thing if anything past 1-10 is sharded. 1-10 is a short starter experience. 10-20 is where you start to mesh with the world at large. You see people of all classes and races. Me and many people will be disappointed if we continue to get tossed around planes of existence, when the biggest thing most people want with Classic is the community, one continuous contiguous population that exists in the same world. 
---
Blizzard is literally expecting a large amount of people to not continue to play the game, so i think it’s funny that you call me elitist for reflecting their opinions.
---
My friend took over 100 runs to see it, good luck lol.
---
Also worth noting that these are only the documented changes. Blizzard has always been famous for undocumented changes 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.1.0_(undocumented_changes)
---
I did not play the original RTS. I faction changed to alliance in BC though and all the Lich King/Forsaken/Scarlet Crusade/Plaguelands lore just completely sucked me in.
---
I plan to play probably an orc or tauren shaman, but there's a very good chance I'll switch to a human paladin or an undead something beforelong, as is my usual m.o. lol
---
If a rare high priced boe recipe/item drops that someone says they’re going to use I’m going to check the ah for it later. 
---
I’ve heard a lot of shady stories like this. It’s quick enough to check the ah that it’s not a hassle. I’ll just build a blacklist of people like that and spread the word when I can. 
---
ya priest levels great as disc/shadow til lvl 40... also ya, the only reason I can play that much is my fiance goes to be by 9-10pm and I will sacrafice sleep and stay up til 12-1 to play lol
---
&gt;Side Note i made ALOT of money with pots HUGE AMOUNTS and im not saying which potion made me the most and tbh looking at it people would say, nah this potion dont sell well, well wrong made me thousands and thousands and thousands.
---
This can't be emphasized enough. Herb + Alch is the absolute biggest gold maker in the entire game. You don't even need rare recipes. With just swiftness potions, elixirs, not even greater ones, you can make insane amounts of gold.
---
Herb + Alch = Rich
---
Where’d you get my CT scans?
---
YOU'RE NOT HELPING lol
---
I don't think updated pvp gear in AQ is a good idea. Rank 14 takes 12 weeks. You can get better weapons in AQ than the rank 14 weps, with MUCH less effort.
---
I won’t be impressed till you do vanilla sunken temple ;) 
---
How? Wrote a full paragraph of fake things I didn't say and don't think and I'm the troll lol
---
https://youtu.be/XQwH0atQZ0Q
---
Is a fun watch for druid PvP. 
---
Well this beats playing games naked.
---
I had very lucky go and got it on my 3rd try. Also got Ashes of Alar on first try. My luck is over. 
---
I would like to collaborate with you on this project. Will DM you after work this evening. 
---
&gt;Those against changes like this under the argument “but it wouldn’t be classic anymore,” by all means feel free to provide a valid reason for your belief.
---
Sure thing. Alliance now has an extra viable tank class. This could potentially greatly impact faction balance issues even more.
---
Additionally, while I wouldn't consider myself "no changes", the argument "because it didn't work like that in vanilla" is still a perfectly valid reason considering the scope and intent of the project, which if you speak business double-talk boils down to recreating vanilla wow to skirt abandonware issues and protect the I.P. by competing with and drawing players back from private servers.
---
I hope they keep it to both spite these delusional weirdos and prove that virtually nothing will happen. 
---
Any word yet on how hard getting the top rank in PvP will be this time? I remember back in the day some people had to play 20 hours a day it seemed like to get Grand Marshall or whatever the top title was with the best weapons. I’m wondering if that will be one thing Blizz makes slightly easier since they have tried to promote somewhat healthier in-game practices since those days.
---
Very interesting.  3.8 second swing.  I wonder if swing speed will be normalized in phase 1.
---
That's the point.
---
It removes the incentive to grind PvP just for gear.
---
Rag never had any actual nerfs though, what people considered as nerfs were classes becoming more powerful and "fixed" throughout vanilla. But Rag personally was never nerfed in any way as far as I remember
---
How many pets could you have as a hunter?  I seem to remember it being a bit of a bitch i you wanted to switch it up. 
---
Could you explain why engineering is a must? I only played the tail end of classic so my info about around that time is pretty limited. I was also considering making a mage as my first or second character. Thanks!
---
Official word is they will both be included in the same subscription.
---
How about AH think?
---
This guy wows. You will start hating your outdated weapons very quickly on a weapon oriented class, and you will outgrow them quickly even on a warrior or rogue. A decent bag will last you a significant portion of the game and possibly forever even if only a bank slot, and the sooner you get it the smoother your gameplay experience will be.
---
I think we're going in circles at this point, I'll let you have your opinion and we can agree to disagree. 
---
The good thing though is that Blizzard seems to be pushing for a very authentic experience seeing as they also recently changed their plans for the patch progression cycle to be more "vanilla" esque, so I think it's going to be good news for people like me and not so good news for people who want big custom stuff.
---
Why would anyone grind rank 14 then, if it wasn't for the gear?  You have to have a damn good incentive to farm rank 14, so having the gear added when the raid content is on par or better than is a really dumb idea.
---
One step ahead of you, I would never sell a high priced Recipe on the AH on the same character that i looted it on, if i was trying to fool them. And this method only works for Scrolls/Recipes.
---
I think the top end dmg is pretty high as well
---
We have a podcast?! 
---
Offtank is definitely doable. I OT'd MC which is a far cry from real end game, but you are an angel, furry damage sponge with crazy dodge, a huge health pool, and tons of armor. 
---
5 mans you can often do better than a warrior that has good gear.
---
MT is out of my skillset to comment on but I did not see too many back in the day - or today on private servers. No shield is a huge hurdle to overcome.
---
In vanilla there was People Who pinged and checked server location. I bet People will tell us so we know where our ping is good this time also
---
Wind serpent master race. Ranged DD attack with no cooldown (can spam twice) and it eats conjured bread. 
---
Lol. Kids are usually in bed by 9 and wife 10-11. I cant stay up much later than that, maybe 12, as work next morning :(
---
I'll still get in some time tho :)
---
That's admirable of you. But Warcraft is a game about War , and I play a rogue. If anything, i'm just RPing my character, what's wrong with that?  
---
"All is fair in love and war"
---
There are ways around it, but I’ll still check it out. If some high level boe gets posted on the ah shortly after a run by a lvl 10 It’s pretty easy to guess where it came from. 
---
I'm not the best person to ask, because I think the entire PvP ranking system is hopelessly broken.
---
You might as well skill up something while you're leveling right? Side note: what's your take on the profitability of fishing vs other professions or mind as a hunter? 
---
whoa yeah, these super fun-looking group world pvp encounters are definitely convincing me that raising the population cap of vanilla servers slightly will be a terrible idea
---
lmfao 
---
Lucky for us the important patterns are bop a long time before they go boe. Only pserver make them 1.10 boe on launch
---
No Loot trading please
---
nothing not even from master looter
---
you make a mistake you get punished for it
---
simple as that
---
I did the same. Done the UD rogue on Shattered Hand. Lol. I even pulled the music out of this video for my Myspace page. 
---
I can only think of added items. Can you name a few key ones?
---
It's a really really long list of the advantages both pvp and pve I think I wrote it up no long ago.
---
Goblin sapper charges, instant AOE grenade around you that does 500 damage to everyone (including yourself), incredibly useful in raiding for AOE'ing down stuff or bosses like Vicidus, or even just for any boss for extra damage. That's PVE, it's ridicules for pvp too, very strong burst for combos, get rogues out of stealth, and in 40vs40 or similar fight over world dragons or just at raid entrances, these are absolute game changers.
---
Reflectors, these are pretty costly, but they are trinket that gives you a 5 second reflect on a school of spells, frost fire or shadow. Imagine reflecting a death coil from a warlock, or reflecting a pyroblast. So much fun! Also the fire one makes you reflect SAPPER CHARGES back to the caster and makes you immune to the damage, even bigger game changers for 40vs40.
---
Iron grenades, super cheap, with some skill you land these very consistently and it allows you to get a free chainlightning off or heal off doing the 3 second in-capitation.
---
Rocket boots !!! Man these things are so nice 20 seconds of speedyboi.
---
Invis trinket, oh boi, I typically have this one on when im just doing my thing, 1 hour cooldown but this thing gives you instant stealth usable IN COMBAT. Almost guaranteed to get you out of jail card.
---
Netomatic, fires a net at the boi for 10 seconds, issues with a warrior? no more.
---
Wanna kill the warrior in style? gnomish deathray(gnomish only!), it has a 3 second cast with some damage to you, but it does 1-4k damage on the target.
---
Want to cc the target to cast it? Try rocket helm, you charge to the enemy and basically put a sap on them.
---
Or you can MC helmet the player and use him for extra damage or even heal yourself if it's a healer, Vurtne did this in one of his vids actually.
---
Ofc there's also teleport to tanaris(gnomish) or winterspring(goblin). These are very useful teleports for both factions since these locations are quite far away from any capital(mageport), especially the tanaris one. I esp. like tanaris as a alliance to get to diremaul a lot quicker.
---
Oh and there's also a summonable chicken that buffs your party with atkspeed, and a dragonling that puts a fire damage taken increased debuff on mobs, trust me in AQ your mages will love you for this one. Both can be summoned before a fight and then trinketswapped.
---
*cries in 15 inch laptop on the microscopic kitchen table of a Hong Kong apartment*
---
*looks at map*
---
Oh it's made with inkarnate and it looks very interesting. There's a cave in the North and a field in the east... Wait a minute, this looks very familiar...
---
*Looks in the top left corner* 
---
Ooooohhhhhh
---
Thanks dude. It was years ago and I’ve moved on. I hope she’s at peace as I am.
---
I agree. It's a pretty broken system, but they aren't going to change it, so they gotta figure out a good place to put the updated gear. Gonna be tough figuring it out because all the items, including the new 60 blue set (which is pretty easily obtainable), are really really strong.
---
My biggest issue is that its damn near impossible to “mis-click” by accident. Everyone I’ve ever known has either used that as their go-to GM excuse or lied to the people they ninja looted. So why use this as a reason to add Loot Trading?!Ninja looting for that matter, actually happens a VERY small part of the time if you know the kind of players to avoid.
---
If you can’t figure out the VERY simple loot system in WoW Classic and mess up and lose out on loot, oh well, not anyone’s problem especially mine or a GM’s. Loot Trading wasn’t in Classic for a reason, it made loot feel more “final” and “Earned.” 
---
Also, if you dont have the constitution to deal with losing out on loot, maybe this isnt the game for you. 
---
Sharding in starter zones will be closer to the vanilla experience than no sharding. 
---
I don't get the down votes.  What is wrong with the spec?
---
Is it because it doesn't have Nature's Swiftness?  I don't see the point in wasting 21 talent points for a crutch spell (that I would only be able to use once every 3 mins), a small increase in health from Rejuv., and a 2% less chance of being hit.
---
Is it the 5 points in Feral Instinct?  Stealth is invaluable in my opinion, so the harder I am to detect the better.  I'm well aware of abilities to detect stealth (Perception for example)...it's all the more reason to put points into Feral Instinct.
---
Is it the 5 points in Feral Aggression?  I find a 40% increase in AP reduction is more valuable than some of my abilities costing 5 less energy to cast.  If I need the energy, I'll powershift.  I am more than OK with a 60% chance for energy gain with Furor.
---
I can't see any other talent that would be criticized.  So what is it about the spec that's so bad to warrant a down vote?
---
Haha sorry :'(
---
The only reason I got my mount at 40 was because at one point they switched which was more expensive; the mount or the training. I had bought the lest expensive one first and then they switched it so I got them both for the lesser value. 
---
These pserver launches were their own kind of chaotic fun, though. Grouping with 4 other level 1s to tag level 5 mobs just to squeak out some XP.
---
Grouping with random people to quest. I flew solo back in vanilla and into wrath if I wasn't running a dungeon. I enjoy solo play, and it didn't stop me from making friends, but I did most of my questing and exploring solo.
---
I took to grouping more much later down the road in Wrath and, to me, it only adds to rather than detracts from the experience. Dabbling on a pserver was also more fun when I grouped for quests, so I'll probably be randomly inviting people I see along the way.
---
Whatever you've gotta tell yourself to justify your actions in a social, community driven game my man. It's no skin off my ass regardless. I usually establish that everyone should need all blues just to be safe when I run pugs anyways. Most people don't have a problem with that. It kinda sucks for people who may actually need the item, but it keeps it fair.
---
God I hope so. This community is fantastic and I'd really like to play with these folks 
---
this makes me want to sprinkle some glowing dust into the wind for some reason
---
Being a clicker AND having auras on the bar? Solid 8.7/10.
---
anyone who doesnt want hurting eyes after 30 minutes will most likely not do that 
---
Wow! Thanks for the great response :). I had no idea there were so many neat tools associated with engineering. Sounds like it could be a useful profession for almost any class.
---
I’ve had that experience on pservers and it’s not fun. Sharding is a great solution - *for levels 1-20 only*. I’m not sure what people are so worked up about.
---
Um... I appreciate the attempt at nostalgia, but that would be like buying a 1998 Hyundai Accent, which is what I drove when WoW came out.
---
Okay, I'll keep an eye out. Thanks for the response!
---
I think i just misunderstood exactly how hard it was to acquire all of this gear in vanilla. I wanted to find a way to be arms in PvP, but still be able to get into raids. But it doesnt seem possible given the time commitment because im not trying to spend 4+ hrs a day on WoW, so i am really not the "dedicated player" that some other comments make it out to be. I just misunderstood how deep the grind exactly was in vanilla, probably because i never actually got to play the game at that time, i started during wotlk.
---
Some guy was harping about examples. There you go.
---
Since you're leveling with a Paladin partner you guys can run dungeons so easily you'll be swimming in all the weapons you'll want - since your dungeon runs don't need to even include another melee dps.
---
At the end of the day, you can play any class, you're going to wear a rocket helmet and throw grenades and sapper charges fighting alongside a robot chicken, so you might as well be a gnome. 
---
I've been feeling a bit nostalgic lately thinking about Classic. Those late nights with 39 of my closest friends were some of the best times I've ever had.
---
Because duel-spec takes away having to stick to a decision, its that or pay for being fickle. How it was seen back then was that being bad at solo mat-grinding/money grinding was made up for by being the most wanted/needed roles.  
---
You want instant groups, name recognition, and that feeling important, that’s the price you pay.
---
You fooken arses better wait for three sunders this time or I'll fooken dock yer dkp for this raid!
---
Yeah. Pretty much guaranteed that they are building this six phase system in such a way that they can roll it to new “fresh” Classic servers on any timelines they want down the line, if there is player demand for that.
---
Personally, I love leveling new alts but there’s nothing like doing it on a fresh server. I even did this back during the old days of vanilla. I’d be happy to keep paying my $15/month pretty much forever if there were regular “fresh” release. Mature servers would have to be continually consolidated, of course, based on active pop.
---
Yeah but you don't have actual proof, it would be an assumption, what if you crucified the wrong person for putting an item on the AH because they just so happen to put up an auction at the time of your witch hunt? That would make you just as bad, or worse, than the person you're trying to hunt.
---
i won't pretend i know anything about paladins, i'm a horde exclusive player. 
---
@OP : Tell me exactly what item you're afraid of someone colluding to keep you from getting.  I'm curious where you think loot trading will be an issue.  So cite me a specific example.
---
except classes who can tank/dps or heal/dps dont have an issue with being indecisive, they have to pick between solo spec or group spec
---
interesting. that could be an option. Would the spec look any different that a typical fury spec if i decide to go the 2H route?
---
Maybe i've been ruined for playing on Pservers for 6 years. Have you ever played with a Russian?
---
Greater fire resistance pots and call it a day. No fire resistance gear for the silly drakes
---
yeh, i dont think ill have the time. I think i was confused on just how deep the grind was in vanilla since i have been accustomed to how easy retail is in terms of gearing. I think i may have to re think being a warrior, or maybe go fury and use a 2h for pvp as fury, not sure yet. Thanks for the input!
---
thanks for your insights!
---
I loved new servers too.  I'd rush to get the rare-ish recipes so I can cash in on fresh max levels.
---
was like that on nostalrius
---
I love your work man, thanks for making these!
---
yeh im thinking i may have to go fury for both pve and pvp. maybe use a 2h as fury in pvp. Im not too sure what a build that is decent at both (pve and pvp) for fury would look like, but thats not the issue, i can find it somewhere.
---
&gt;as whether or not respecing would change his "BIS". Its a legitimate question. Obviously the weapons change, but, for instance, does one utilize crits more than the other, does one have agilit
---
yes, this is what i was trying to get at. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Go back to your parents basement and let them cut off your internet. That way no one can mess anything up for you except yourself.
---
Go back to chinadale and never leave, kthnxbye.
---
My lock's voidwalker was named Phanvhug. 
---
Yes they have a choice, but money was specifically complained about and it only cost you if you are indecisive.  Yes you have to choose between group and solo spec, along with most dps. Yes they will have an easier time farming in either spec than you, but as a tank/healer you’ll have an easier time finding groups. Being a mage the first time around, i waited for hoursss sometimes. It balances out, this isnt newer iterations of the game, you cant have your cake and eat it too.
---
Man, it's the fourth time you're posting this. [1rst](https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0exz0/_/) [2nd](https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0g1r5/_/)
---
[3rd]
---
(https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0g5of/will_bosses_prenerf/)
---
And still no concrete examples of MC/BWL bosses being directly nerfed.
---
Mate, don't pretend. You're just an asshole. 
---
If you're talking about the door after the summoner's tomb (7 dwarves) boss encounter that leads to the lyceum, you don't need a key to open that door like /u/DanielTeague suggested.
---
After you kill the seven dwarves the door that leads to the lyceum will automatically open and let you in.
---
so youre telling me the point of rolling a tank/healer is to allow people like you to run dungeons?  nice
---
That's pretty rude tbh. 
---
you forgot the shaman stone but still awesome
---
That G15 though! I had that still til last year
---
&gt;The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible.
---
&gt;The Golemagg and Shazzrah encounters in the Molten Core has undergone some changes.
---
&gt;Ragnaros now stays up 2 hours rather than 1 after being summoned.
---
I wouldn’t spread anything if I didn’t know for sure. I may not even care if they’re a good player. I would realistically only do it in the case of very valuable items or if I recognize the person from a previous run and they already got the drop before. It depends on the individual and the initial impression. If they’re a dick hole I’ll definitely keep a closer eye on them. 
---
If others start bringing up their name along with mentions of similar activity then it could lead to avoiding the player entirely. 
---
I fucking hate gnomes, that's how.
---
Yeah it's a really good profession for any class except if you are a healer that uses double proffesions for some money maker like alch+herb or something. Else I don't see a good enough reason not to go engineering.
---
I support this post 100%
---
After learning more about gul'dan, im excited to play an orc as my warlock.
---
Very rough sketch of the WSG map.
---
That gets a 10/10 from me.
---
Same
---
Also if you are an off-hour kind of person you will, hopefully, find other people who have the same schedule as you. It'll no longer be so much "LF1M DPS" as it will be "Hey guys - down for Gnomer again this Thursday?"
---
&gt; The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible.
---
It does not help your case that you conveniently removing the part that says 
---
* The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair **will now always happen while Ragnaros is combat.**
---
It's the closest thing to a nerf you found though.
---
&gt; The Golemagg and Shazzrah encounters in the Molten Core has undergone some changes.
---
Not a direct nerf unless you know what changes were made.
---
&gt; Ragnaros now stays up 2 hours rather than 1 after being summoned.
---
Not a direct nerf.
---
Aye, you need the Shadowforge Key to open the big doors to the lyceum with all the flamekeepers in it.
---
I think if you have an Engineer with you who has a [Large Seaforium Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/item=4398/large-seaforium-charge), that might be able to blow the doors up as well if no one has the key.
---
The way you get the quest for the Shadowforge Key is that first you have to die, and while you're in your ghost form you are able to see a dead dwarf ghost standing on top of a tomb in the center pillar of Blackrock Mountain which you have to run through to get to the dungeon.
---
If another person already has the quest they can share it with you, but to deliver the quest and get the key you have to talk to the NPC again so you'll have to get yourself killed again for that part as well.
---
Ragnaros could at least plant some trees in there... It's way too empty.
---
Zero BWL boss nerfs in your post.
---
The only low effort thing i see is wearing a blue t-shirt
---
Yeah I get it, they were fixing bugs while simultaneously nerfing.
---
That's sort of besides the point when they swipe damage off of everything.
---
How on Earth did you pull that out of what I said? No, Im saying tanks/healers immediate appeal is for group settings, thus you have an advantage at finding groups opposed to more offensive classes/specs that have an easier time farming. Its a CHOICE, and you can have both in this version of the game. Period.
---
BWL:
---
&gt; There is no longer a one-hour time restriction on the Vaelastraz the Corrupt encounter in Blackwing Lair.
---
&gt; The Razorgore encounter has been changed slightly to make it less "random".
---
Molten Core:
---
&gt; The Golemagg and Shazzrah encounters in the Molten Core has undergone some changes. (they don't detail)
---
Onyxia's Lair
---
&gt; Onyxia's fireballs will no longer result in a confuse effect (Engulfing Flames)
---
I'd rather have proper balance of the mechanics and fights so that we have the best possible experience and recreation of the boss fights. I don't think that means just taking the hardest version of each fight. 
---
What I want is blizzard to consider the 1.12 talents possibly itemization and of course the knowledge, internet and computers of today, and make fights last so that you get to experience the actual mechanics(and the SAME mechanics as vanilla) of the boss, you win by properly handling the mechanics and you lose if you don't. Those are the criteria. Examples of mechanics and dealing with them?
---
Lucifron: You use consumes and dispells to handle the dots. 
---
Magmardar: You have a lot of flames that you need to avoid, and fears to be worried about.
---
garr: You CC and tank the adds and invidiually take the down and eventually kill the boss
---
etc etc.
---
We don't know how accurate fights are on private servers, it's impossible to say, but stuff is done there that breaks these criteria. Such as killing baron geddon before first lava stuff (stacking recklessness), shazzrah getting killed before teleport, garr getting nuked and add explosions tanked, ragnaros killed before phase 2, razorgore defeated by just killing everything when it spawns, vaelstraz being killed before tank bomb, firemaw killed without reseting stacks, the list goes on. I don't want that to happen, I want the actual fight mechanics to appear.
---
That's all really, the fights are still gonna be fairly easy, because we know the mechanics and they are easy to deal with, but you cannot really make the fights harder than that without either making them big gear checks or changing the mechanics. I don't want that. 
---
well then i fully expect you to farm the consumables and incidentals for your tanks and healers in your raid guild.  if thats your intention then i apologize im the asshole here
---
But indirectly stealing gold from other players somehow isn't? 
---
Excellent points, thanks for posting this 👌
---
First character was a Tauren Warrior. At around level 20 I decided to see just how big the world was and took the zepplin to Tirisfal. Ran all the way down to Searing Gorge and found the Molten span. I nearly shit myself. I still remember the feeling of "I should NOT be here" combined with pure awe. 
---
I will more than happy to as long as the same healers and tanks run dungeons they might not need for me. Because ya know, thats how guilds normally work. I may actually Tank myself, but i realize im not “owed” anything and people wanting a prot warrior will be enough for me.
---
Is the person behind the kid with the VR headset walking away from the camera? Or towards it? 🤔
---
Loot trading is a good change imho. Pros are you can correct ml mistakes, missclicks etc. If someone roll on something they shouldn’t they have the option to trade it to the right player instead of getting kicked and shamed in tradechat. Cons are it can be exploited with friends/guildies, one way to fix it would be to make need rolls BoP and be untradable (even BoE’s), and not letting for example warr roll need on cloth, staves, wands, caster swords/maces/daggers, offhands etc. 
---
but you said it yourself; the reason you roll a tank or healer is for high group prio.  so if im supposed to sit my ass in town waiting for turds like you to finish farming, you better be farming for me as well
---
Sorry, I missed that step.
---
Still, it adds the option to be a jerk without much reason.  Loot going to the wrong person because of a misclick wasn't a big deal, and was rectified with tickets.  The fact it was a logged ticket when you submitted it made it less likely to be abused.
---
I don't see it as much improvement over the original.
---
Lore wise, Blood Elves are my favorite race by far. But they obviously won't be in vanilla, so I'll be rolling human. As much as I love the horde, I want my main to be a Paladin. There's so much RP potential and I feel like it would be a ton of fun to mess around with. I want to organize a full Paladin Strat/Scholo run, gank groups of horde going into SM dressed up as a Scarlet Crusade member, or maybe just roam the plaguelands hunting Forsaken players. I'll try to raid and all that, but my favorite memories of wow were simply being dumb with friends.
---
could I use these maps your making for DnD? :p theyre really well suited for it
---
Even if it's not on purpose, I've seen them blocked on accident a bunch.
---
The worst starting zone for the best race
---
Basically /r/choosingbeggars complaining about not getting paid for art
---
HOW ARE YOU GETTING THAT? Why are you suddenly waiting on people? If someone wants to farm and make you wait, kick them and find someone else. Again though, being a helpful member of a guild fixes all of this....Im starting to think you’re not going to get it.
---
No, I like my sanity.
---
you do a long tedious quest for the epic that involves getting stuff from various professions then a western dire maul run.
---
The level 40 i believe you just train but the demon trainin basically negates the savings.
---
For fucks sake just leave shit the fuck alone. They were nerfed for a reason, I dont know what that reason is, nor do I care. I just want fucking try hards to stop demanding we rebalance molten fucking core because some private server hobos think it's too easy. You may as well demand they get rid of the talent revamps and buffed items so "the game is harder". Unless you're rocking t3 or rank 14 gear no one will be impressed no matter what you do to the content.
---
I know. The Shade of Aran song was much more important. But still. I MUST REMEMBER TO PUT ON MY FIRE RESISTANCE GEAR BEFORE FIGHTING FIRRRRREEEEMAAWWWWWW!
---
Druid isn't great endgame at anything, you can make all the specs work if you try hard enough but even then you're still the worst melee dps (maybe besides ret) worst healer, and worst tank.
---
That looks like a picture of the inside of my head with a hat on. 
---
mc will be the only raid for months lol
---
No.
---
This still means blizzard has to re-work and modify a brand new system. It is a burden on them and takes dev time, testing, management, etc
---
It’s simpler to just say, ALL loot is final. The end.
---
I remember BC launch servers had the aq event taking place months after the BC launch.
---
no tradable loot in my opinion. The only way i could see it is if everyone who could roll on it voted with 100 percent yes rate to do the trade and even then i am leaning towards no.
---
Says the guy who is advocating in every thread in this topic for server pops 4 times what the game was designed to handle.  Cognitive dissonance much?
---
And? Wake me up when you get thunder fury or sulferas so I can congratulate you, but rocking t1 or t2 is nothing special regardless of the content phase.
---
You wanted 1.12, they have 1.12. I don't think they even have the pre-patch code. They would be guessing what the pre-patch values would be in the databases.
---
You all need to take a chill. Not everything is worth it.
---
lol head over to /r/wowservers to see how FRESH destroys the communities 
---
Absolutely ☺
---
"What are we? Farmers?"
---
&gt;congratulate you
---
who the hell is going to brag about mc, lol
---
this is about the single only raid available being fun
---
no youre right, i dont get it.  I really hope the pserver community is just a loud minority, drop in the bucket in comparison to the rest of the playerbase.  you guys dont want the 'right' game, you want 'YOUR' game
---
No, vendoring will make more in mara than de
---
I can only remember my felpup.  Zhaartang.
---
This item is one of the few things that has me jealous of Alliance  players. That and Paladins of course. 
---
I hate how they never have sound effects in the PVP videos.
---
Hacks
---
Which, to clarify, is completely understandable. They’re a complete waste of time for them when those folks could be working on actual more pressing tickets. 
---
It's just RPing as a Rogue. No harm no foul. 
---
Haha. We will never relive that stuff no matter how well they recreate vanilla
---
Oh? I keep forgetting that Horde plays quite different to Alliance. 
---
I was more disheartened by the lack of linkin park and drowning pool my self, they don't make em like they used to! 
---
I won't be playing every waking moment because I'm not a kid anymore and have responsibilities. Dumb adult responsibilities
---
Not caring what my girlfriend thinks (now wife)!
---
Saw it drop a couple months into vanilla, was on alliance side too. I lost the roll to a warrior, who for months reminded me constantly by afking on it in ironforge 
---
Modcast
---
Honestly could have just gone to MS paint, fill tool, click green. Done, Lauren zone. A whole lot of nothing for an entire zone. Oh and maybe a lake.
---
Wouldn't you find times that works best with your guild members? How does whether the sun or moon is up in game have anything to do with raiding?
---
You dropped this 🎤
---
Indeed! This seems extreme
---
nice
---
That's the Shadowforge door next to the entrance though. I'm talking about the big ass door leading to the flame pit. What do you do to open it? It wasn't even clickable. We could clearly tell this was what we were searching for but we were stumped on how to open it.
---
....it already does that
---
Someone showed me a polymorphed scool of fish.  That got me good.  Lol. ;)
---
I remember when I tamed a boar. It was a game changer, the charge and dash it had made leveling so much better.
---
You cant trade items you have equipped. I know its still possible to have a "decoy" item you use before and then equip the item you already had in your bags, but most people upset about loot trading dont even seem to know how it actually works.
---
If I manage to get 2 to 60 I’ll be happy lol
---
It is as simple as this, you do tailoring for robes of the void only, not to make money. Have fun peddling your 5g xmutes with tailoring every FOUR days. 
---
Robes of Volatile Power(23 damage 2.25 to crit [2% from equip, 15 intel is one fourth of 60 intellect, which 60 gives another 1% crit]) which drop in MC must be a close second for pure PVE damage versus a flat 46 damage from Robes of Void.
---
You keep those robes until your ZG bloodvine set, that +hit is so important for warlocks because we dont get any talents to increase hit for shadowbolt, whereas mages get 5/5 they can spend into frostbolt hit. 
---
I have no evidence for this. Just a feeling that it will be middle to late August. I really hope I’m wrong. 
---
Devilsaur Mafia, prices got close to 20 gold per piece of leather. 
---
Holy cow, look at how defined those legs are in the top right!
---
Drooody
---
Horde's equivalent is a lot shorter than alliance. I remember hearing that the max level obtainable with only gossip/delivery quests was quite lower on the horde side because there are a lot less "go talk to X at Y location" quests. I remember that the max horde level obtainable through that method was a few levels lower than the alliance one, not sure if it's even possible to hit 10 with it.
---
Have people forgotten that if you rolled need on a BoP piece when loot trading is active it binds to you and you cannot trade it. You can only trade if it was won through a greed roll or passed out by a masterlooter. 
---
Raid Leader: "You're standing in fire!"
---
-"Where?"
---
Not a nerf.
---
Lol literally not how it worked in Vanilla, but I see we’re all supposed to be drowning in the Kool-Aid in this thread, so why do I even bother. 
---
Put that on a female tauren...and watch the beef *slide*.
---
They have higher HP and are good for resistance fights. Pretty steep downgrade from a warrior on most other fights.
---
Updates are easier to spot on /r/all if not stickied, and a lot of users (myself included) have been conditioned to mentally filter out stickies because most subreddits have them 24/7/365.
---
It's easier to tell there's something with a +1000 score post ontop of the subreddit, then you know for sure it's new.
---
Was claw more dps than bite? I remember turning off claw so that there would be enough focus for bites - noob thing to do?
---
No disagreement there at all.
---
They definitely weren't as easy to gear or "viable". If you REALLY want to tank going warrior is a much easier path to success and finding a raid spot in a decent guild.
---
Hey I have a related question.
---
I am thinking of levelling a priest first, with herb/skinning and then dropping skinning for tailoring. 
---
If I just get a bank alt to do my alchemy, can I still reap most of the benefits from it if I feed him herbs from my main?
---
It assumes that people will generally join servers of the same timezone as them. This means that if you live in the West Coast, you'd be four hours (or is it three? I'm not American) behind the East Coast. Basically, instead of starting your raid at 7 or 8 PM, you're starting it at 4 PM. Big difference.
---
But as someone who's in Europe, is that really the case? Like, people gravitate to and match servers that match their timezone? If the servers don't display what timezone they are in, it won't matter at all what you pick because people will join servers randomly.
---
You should still choose something in your timezone though for the sake of ping.
---
Wouldn't damage be from a database? They have pre-1.12 loot
---
&gt;Hakkar melee damage reduced.
---
Example
---
There's lore? I just want to slay nerds.
---
If it means changing the way loot worked in Vanilla, Blizzard shouldn't be doing it.  Simple.
---
Make Vanilla WoW, Vanilla WoW.  Overpopulated young servers with disconnects and ques and everything.
---
There's a subreddit where you can find a private server that fits you perfectly.  I think I can safely say I speak for 95% of the people in this topic when I say don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
---
Tailoring can be decently profitable if you craft and sell bags.
---
I don't suppose there will be VR WoW...
---
No, play warrior if you want to tank raids. I don't see warriors whining they can't heal and give the best buffs in the entire game.
---
Releasing stuff is a toggle. It is not an engineering challenge.
---
What would be an engineering challenge is if the patches actually changed anything meaningful in the game, beyond whether something unlocks, or doesn't. That is to say, if Phase 1 means Patch 1.0's **balance**, talent trees, spell damage and such, yes, it's no doubt a huge engineering challenge... but that's not what they're doing. Or at least they didn't say they're doing that, they said we'd be on Patch 1.12 but they'd roll out content in phases.
---
Which is basically just can you or can you not enter Dire Maul.
---
Yea doesn't matter its not lvl 10 but anywhere near that Id like it if its efficient 
---
Oh yeah! 
---
That was the biggest discussion point for quite a while, only died down when the discussion turned to who would be the fifth alliance race.
---
VR would be pretty cool
---
Please god no...just play the goddamn game people, stop stressing over irrelevant insignificant shit JFC 
---
I agree, but I'm sure not everyone does.
---
I'd like an option to transfer my character to a BC server when the time comes. But then we are very likely to fragment and lose our community. I would infinitely prefer that the server itself updates to TBC, but I understand not everyone may want that.
---
Low effort.
---
50-60 hour work weeks, 2 young children, I'm hoping I have the time to get 1 60 and get dungeon blues
---
You aren’t at war with people of your same faction.
---
Yeah, I get that LCD fixes are understandable and necessary even for live in the current state, but classic is a completely different story and am glad they’re adjusting accordingly!
---
Hey man, Mangletooth is a homie.
---
With pservers these days, everyone assumes that DME AoE farming was common knowledge. I can assure you it wasnt.
---
I very strongly remember farming for NR gear and Living Essence going for about 20g, which drop all the time in DME farm and are usually vendored on pservers.
---
&gt;you should be locked into the loot rules which means you know what the plan was before you entered a group
---
this wont work for things like brd and ubrs. having to masterloot all the trash as the tank would make everything take 2x as long
---
I’m in at 200 for said canvas!
---
Imo, you really can't go wrong with Engineering and Tailoring. Engi is vital for PvP, and very useful for PvE too. Tailoring gives you BiS from Robe of the Archmage, and from 3/3 Bloodvine.
---
Then the first idea is viable. Have an item on reserve via the UI which selects the party member an item will go to when it pops up and the quantity. If it doesn't drop, the UI won't auto master loot the item to the selected player.
---
Getting a BOE epic drop and the game will have been a success lol
---
I never said I played on a pserver. More assumptions on your end.  The same can be said about you, you don’t want WoW Classic, you want some WoTLK+/Classic hybrid. 
---
Someone else might be more knowledgeable than I am on this subject but I’m pretty sure your alchemy alt will have to be at least lvl 45(?) to get max alchemy. Then there’s the issue of crafting certain high tier elixirs which require the Alchemy table in stratholme and/or BWL. 
---
You won’t get the full potential out of your alchemy alt unless he’s lvl 60. If you want to have two 60’s anyway then go for it but if you’re just having an alt for alchemy I’d say it isn’t worth it
---
Yeah.  I tried to get back into a pserver a few months ago.  Gave up around mid-20s.  Overcrowding made it impossible to do any questing without constantly getting ganked.  Too fast respawns limited what classes I could reasonably play without getting overwhelmed by basic creep camps.  It wasn't fun and I stopped.  Now I'm splitting my time between Minecraft and DII.
---
I honestly don’t mean to be rude but how do you have the time to do this? 
---
Really was not bad at all compared to when wow first launched. Downright smooth compared to most modern launches. And OW was hands down smooth as hell. He’s not wrong, most of their launches do going incredibly smooth all things considered when accounting for normal launch day issues. 
---
I wont argue raids, but dungeons were only capped to 5-man in 1.10, for the majority of vanilla, players would run these dungeons 10 man or more pre-1.3.
---
They removed spawns from almost all 60 5 mans because they took REALLY long to finish, like over 2 hours as a 10man sometimes and considered completely impractical as a 5 man.
---
You cant really just look at them as a perspective that people were just clearing these easily as 5 man groups, because they really werent, they were incrementally trying to make dungeons more 5 man friendly until finally making it a hard cap in 1.10
---
You described all of Reddit now a days perfectly. Bravo!
---
&gt;We don't know how accurate fights are on private servers, it's impossible to say
---
I never raided on pservers so I wouldn't know. I just vividly remember a wave of guilds downing bosses promptly after misc patches
---
Thank you for saying this, 100% agree.
---
At this point a little more challenging to the encounters wouldn’t hurt a thing, especially with the extent of min/maxing you see. 
---
The servers lag if there's more than 10 people in a single server now, so that's pretty untrue.
---
Only two because Activision doesn't actually have any video games.
---
Because the same people that complain about Blizzard time-gating content in Retail are the same people applauding Blizzard for time-gating content in Classic.
---
They had loot trading in classic, you just had to open a ticket to do it. Big waste of time for everyone.
---
I bet you play everything, because you have nothing else to do.
---
ok maybe mookake
---
I blame Redridgeboss
---
It appears to be a map of OP's brain.
---
I can easily see that happening. Anyway people will be way better at the game no matter what now, just the pc and internet alone is huge. Blizzard needs to adapt to that.
---
I am having an issue parsing that action bar of yours. I mean I guess since I never raided in classic I missed the days when you just spammed one spell. 
---
As a ninja, I approve. 
---
Circlejerk.
---
MC is Tier 1, it shouldn't be hard.
---
Mechagnomes, I think. Dwarves are infinitely cooler, with a cool name like Earthen, plus they show up in the War of the Ancients.
---
Mechagnomes are just... mecha gnomes.
---
My thoughts:  If they have enough success, ie another surprise success like when they first launched WoW, and had to start running more servers for the growing player base, they should do what they're shaping up to do with logical phase progression, and mimic that in all new servers.
---
I changed to a new server early on because the progression I experienced on the high pop servers felt like it ruined the casual experience similar to how people who came into WoW post vanilla felt like they were always playing catch up with the rest of the population until they were max level.  The major appeal to the majority of casuals in Vanilla was... the journey.  A journey with true hard fought for milestones that were satisfying and done alongside a sizeable population of fellow adventurers all the way to the end (60).
---
In the end, we're talking about a company that is ultimately driven only by the $/month subscriptions to WoW, at least in terms of drive for working on Classic.  If they get a flood of new and re-subscribers that's worth a good amount of revenue for them, they'll put the effort in based on what they learned from trying this, and try to keep it going.
---
It's the same force that drove the ruining of retail, striving for subscriptions.
---
This time though, we as a community that desire Classic, can show them that this group of fans/players/whatever you call yourself, is a group worth their effort of appealing to a specific crowd, instead of a general, broad crowd.
---
If this is successful enough for Blizzard, I expect they will be encouraged to pursue a broader spectrum of server options, including progression type servers.  
---
In the far future: Classic server characters having to fight for their own WoW citizenship, to be seen equal to characters in retail.
---
American company.  Vote with your dollar.  I'm much better off financially than I was 15-13 years ago.  I might consider having multiple accounts to show Blizzard how much I appreciate their return to core-PC game principals.  True GAMER principles... no pay to win, no free-to-play revenue generation gimmicks, no micro transactions... and a reminder to play with your friends outside the World of Warcraft on the loading screen...lol.
---
End rant.
---
Considering weapon normalisation happened approx 12 months before  1.12 came out, I think it's safe to say yes, instant attacks will be normalised.
---
I'm the same way, and that's why I rolled Alliance. But I want to play Horde this time around, partially because it would mean I won't need to find a new community if and when TBC launches since I'd want to be Horde for TBC. I'm already an adult and very busy--in three years I'm sure I won't have time to really get into yet a new community.
---
I played on a medium/low pop server back then and I remember some people believing it had been removed from the loot table lol I know the one that DID drop on the server near the beginning, broke apart the guild it dropped for. 
---
Are you working with the free version?  Some google searching shows inkarnate has some pretty decent graveyard assets.
---
Well, un-nerfing the bosses would be a start
---
Most of the early 2005 nerfs weren't documented
---
Except that one guy breaking his crt out of storage.
---
Slower the better IMO.  I want you to have to start a guild, recruit 39+ other competent level 60s that are interested in working on those raids, and good luck.
---
PuG raids are a sign of a server with too high population too long, nearing a patch/expansion.
---
&gt; MC is Tier 1, it shouldn't be hard.
---
That's scrub talk
---
It lags because they have horizontal server configurations. for example, many many micro sized scalable servers. these micro servers cannot handle a lot of centralized action. 
---
blizzard knows world pvp is dead and saves a shitload of money scaling down the servers vastly at night and raising the resources during prime time. nobody wants to fuck with anyone else anymore and server community literally does not exist. so why does it matter if you have 100000 server objects instead of 60. 
---
TLDR; the servers lag because Blizzard is pinching pennies and are cheap as fuck, not because 15 million people are crushing the servers right now. 
---
is that orb of deception on your hotbar and a lesser stonescale potion on your action bar?
---
also, my favorite part is that AFK hunter on the right with T0 shoulders not stacking.
---
VR of STV? No thanks. The PTSD is bad enough from a monitor.
---
Word.  I've almost got my 5-man of RL friends to jump back into WoW with me.  
---
Now I'm gonna be one of those "family guild" leaders, kids and all...future.
---
I sold my engine crane when I sold my mustang so, no. 
---
PSSSHHHH you expect people to read loading screens? 
---
Wait .. actually I agree because even if they fuck up once and mess up some sweet raid loot or something they'll either learn quick or get booted from the guild after arguing and failing to adapt. 
---
I prefer discussion here but have you admit you have raised the bar on memes and content.
---
It should be authentic 
---
I think that it indicates minimal item progression...I didn't read it to bifurcate before and after patch 1.10 just that items would be updated at that point.  I believe they indicated they are only going to bother doing item progression for the items that actually mattered not items with minimal variation.    
---
With that in mind I would expect banthok sash to not be the awesome item on launch;  nor the savage gladiator mail and a few other pieces that get god tier upgrades over the course of vanilla.    
---
I am too lazy to reread the blue post again in light of your read on it; I think you are making the opposite assumption as the people who are clearly reading more into it than should be read into it and reading too much into it as well (or not enough).
---
It doesn't look like a slot machine though.
---
Afraid not, the in game is sort of meant to be a model of the cities, the style, look and major points of interest are all meant to be canon, but theres no "true" maps that exist of the cities.
---
You can explore alternate versions of the cities in WC, WC2 and WC3 though if you want, but I wouldnt be too excited about them.
---
I would just pick a server where 6-10 pm server time is the period with your available play time.
---
Nothing wrong with scrubs killing Rag.
---
I'm not assuming anything. I'm just clarifying what they've said they're doing based on the information currently provided.
---
With Classic coming out I will finally have a MAIN. Been there done that, had like 5 characters between level 40-57 in Vanilla and in WotLK 9x 80s.
---
Feels like we get a second chance.
---
That was 1.4 where a bunch of stuff changed. Those will have the newest version I'm classic.
---
If anything they should buff them to be stronger than they were back then if you want the true vanilla "experience" , you're severely underestimating how much players have evolved since 2004, a lot of things (especially raid encounters) in classic will appear significantly easier than they were in your memory of WoW 2004.
---
Just look compare the amount of mechanics a heroic ( not even gonna say mythic) raider in BFA has to manage on average compared to C'thun, there are more mechanics in a single mythic raiding boss today than the entirety of AQ 40 bosses combined.
---
Much better than MC bar a few items and around The level of starting bosses in BWL. 
---
I mean, I was in Tanaris earlier for one of the new quests and there was legitimately 300 people in my phase, all doing 1 quest in a 100 yard range. That's going to fuck with an server, regardless of phasing.
---
Really? Because I'm sitting in Boralus and I can see about 50 people, 0 lag. Went to Tanaris for a new quest, 300 people in 100 yards, massive lag. Circlejerk some more you fucking loser.
---
Thrall has always been hippy-jesus. Did you play WC3?
---
&gt; Wouldn't damage be from a database?
---
Yeah, I mentioned the values are in the databases. But they don't have the old databases. What were the values for 1.8?
---
&gt; Hakkar melee damage reduced.
---
Yeah, the patch notes won't help, because nothing is specific. It would be a huge mess to pick and choose what damage values to include. How on earth would they choose only some of the millions of database values, without causing some other issues?
---
idsay blizzard is first one to order that kind of art. u herd it here first
---
I had to decide a few weeks ago.
---
Ended up taking 2 weeks before 16th of July and 2 weeks after.
---
If it now would release that date it's perfect. 2 weeks of real vacation and rest gaming.
---
3x the hot fyre!!
---
It's interesting because on Nostalrius core, a lot of these pre-nerf mechanics are implemented. Every fight is intended to be as close to its pre-nerf state as possible.
---
Onyxia's fireballs definitely had the confuse effect on Nostalrius for instance.
---
&gt; Ppl make fun of hunters for rolling need on *everything* yet no one ever talks about rogues &amp; warriors correctly using dkp on *one thing*.
---
Wait, what?
---
People talk about warriors and rogues rolling on everything too. Idk why you think that isn't talked about.
---
&gt;MC isn't hard
---
FTFY
---
Viable, but only one. You'll be dpsing mostly though.
---
I spent days waiting for a Humar. Was such a good pet
---
Prot pal is the worst endgame raid tank sir. Bears can tank some endgame stuff.
---
I said I plan on doing it, doesn't mean I will succeed! Realistically though if it takes me years to complete I'm fine with that. They've not really said what the long term plan is for Classic beyond the recent 6 phase content announcement. After the 6th phase maybe the game will just go into maintenance mode and be a time-capsule of the Vanilla experience... If that's the case, I'm more than content it taking years to level 1 of every race.
---
Good F-in luck lmao leveling 8 characters split in half by faction?? EIGHT???
---
It is a bit, but it's more an interest to me than grinding for the gear at max level... Probably why I have like 14 toons at 110+ on live (my goal there is eventually 1 toon for every spec)
---
Why have one 60 when you can have six 30s?
---
[removed]
---
There will be a Countdown guild on a PvP NA Server - I’m still thinking I’ll actually play on an Oceanic server though, but I’m considering this position. As far as the others go, I’d love to play with callers too, will see what comes when a server list comes out and what can be organised.
---
what dispells SL?
---
True dat. End game grind is killer 
---
&gt; You can jump the wall to ratchet and take the FP to Org instantly.
---
Doesn't the ratchet FP go to XR before org? I Don't think you can go anywhere from ratchet before you unlock XR FP.
---
But if the goal is just bank alt instead of auction house alt then it is only 2 minutes to ratchet
---
Actually healing as a paladin
---
If i manage to even get 2 60's im good
---
I'd love to have one of every class at 60, but can't because it's counterproductive to my goals in Classic. Classic isn't like modern WoW where you level to max and hop into content on every max level character.
---
It takes a long time to level 1-60 and then it takes a long time to do all of the activities at level 60. Farming pre-raid gear, doing professions, rep grinds, quests, attunements, weekly consumables... and then you need to farm gold, and if you enjoy PvP you probably want to stay on top of the rank grind as well. And on top of that you're trying to meet new friends or maintain already existing friendships.
---
I wouldn't be able to set and fulfill goals for myself if I dedicated my time to leveling nine characters to 60. It would probably take me around 1800 hours to do so, which is 10 straight weeks of leveling.
---
I would have nine 60s and get none of the things I'd like to do, done.
---
I've got 14 toons at 110+ on live at the moment, I'm no stranger to having alts.
---
It also helps that technology has improved majorly, I can have Classic open on one screen and Netflix open on the other.
---
I see a Felstriker
---
I dont know if this is the right thread to ask in, but here goes.
---
I plan to play classic when it drops, but my work schedule is during prime raiding times in NA (I work 3-11pm pst). I'd really love to take part in a guild raiding scene, but my experience in the past is that late night raiding guild are inconsistent and unreliable for the most part. 
---
So here's my question: Is it worth it for me to try to play on servers from another region? Would high ping completely kill the experience? Is there a region that's English speaking that would be ideal for raiding after 11pm pst? 
---
Why bring a sub par tank when half the servers level 60s are warriors anyway?
---
Screenshots tell 1000 words 
---
Odds are exceedingly low. At approx. 1% drop rate you have a 1% chance of seeing it drop in any given run, but that does not mean it drops once every 100 runs. You could go hundreds of runs without ever seeing it drop. Or it might drop twice in two runs.
---
If you really wanted to obtain Baron's mount 100% guaranteed you probably need the patience of a saint and be willing to pay for five WoW accounts. Otherwise your odds are as good as anyone else's.
---
Don't bring logic into this discussion /s
---
Because you can post screenshots in Trade.
---
*still out performs better than 99% of raiders' setups in 2005*
---
2) /sit makes you always get critter
---
I only plan on 2 at max level but I do like twinks so I'll likely have a few of those in whatever brackets pop
---
god, installed bfa not long ago and decided to go to sunken temple while collecting apperances
---
i was so upset that 2/3 of the dungeon was missing. funnily enough the walk is also severely shortened and you can no longer possibly get lost
---
Good idea, let's all vote on it! 
---
dw fury prot also gets crit, crushed, cannot block, has half the armor, and nowhere near the health
---
dual wield fury/prot warriors are just wannabe bear druids &gt;.&gt;
---
I've been mulling over the same decision in my mind and my recent experience tells me this:
---
Vanilla pvp can be VERY bursty compared to BC and beyond.  Pretty much everyone can get globalled thoughout (fully geared wars and SL locks maybe not).  While SM//ruin is certainly strong but in BGs you may be frustrated when pallies and priests are dispelling all your dots and fears plus players today are much more addon savy so the decursive gets a lot of attention.  Compare that to hunter/war/rogue/mage/sham landing a couple crits to pop someone before a heal can go off.  If there are no dispellers around or you are in small scale world pvp the lock would be the go to for sure but in BGs that ele sham burst can feel really good.  Locks can surely burst too but as SM/ruin you are going to be really squishy for a while and they don't have the on demand crit cooldown available to them that shamans do.  Neither is a bad choice.  You will likely have an easier time gearing a shaman long term vs a lock competing against the oodles of mage/lock/priest in the raid.  Lock will probably have an easier time fending off ganks if you are farming in open world solo.
---
You should probably expand upon where you want to excel in pvp.  In world pvp smart people will just avoid you as SL. You have no snare or root so people that dont want to fight you just leave.  As SL you also dont have the burst of other specs and classes.  SL could be a good base defender in AB and will shine in duels but I think thats about the extent of where you would want SL over another spec.  Ele sham are wanted just as much if not more than locks for BG premades.
---
My wife got one while leveling during bc. I ran the place hundreds of times on my level 70 warrior and never seen it 
---
We weren't invited?!
---
i love how having to consciously bring up the thought that prot paladins exist is reflective of how gimped they are/were, lol
---
More effort than the average Tips video.
---
Here's my [mind dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a3qq6t/anatomy_of_a_leveling_plan_for_those_who_may_want/) of how I planned that out.
---
Become the hero of the horde for your friends, and work on its companion!
---
My main concern is dwindling server populations after the initial wave of tourists wears off. 
---
Yeah, I want to farm herbs and fish in peace in my AV.
---
verigan's 25DPS @ level 20 vs 23DPS Archeus available at 28.
---
If you want the cap for solely this reason you may as well advocate for cross realm dungeons.  It doesn't address the myriad of issues that come up when you double the intended server population.
---
Not particularly sure why but Magmadar was always the most imposing boss in MC to me (aside from Ragnaros obviously)
---
There's only one battleground we need and it's there day one, it's called stranglethorn vale on a PvP server. The PvP reward is a short window of opportunity to hand in your raptor mastery quest without getting gangbanged. 
---
what kind of aoe tanking? 3-6 mobs or those awkward pulls where theres 2 billion tiny mobs? 3-6 mobs bears are super comfortable - especially if you can position mobs so you can sort of split them into groups in front of you so you can "aim" your swipe and rotate between the groups. as for those 2 billion mini mob pulls, those are really just a "hope your warrior tank has an engineering shield". however, if youre in a 5/10 man, you still do get some pretty solid mass aoe threat gen. thorns is cool, but you can also spec into improved thorns AND stack the 3 set tier 1 set on it by equipping 3 pieces, casting it, and going back to your normal gear. 3 set t1 is so easy to get and no actual resto druids want it, so its sort of a given
---
it kind of works itself out. since you do always have a pretty high amount of crit at any point in game for a tank thanks to your talents and passive agility accumulation, each time swipe crits itll give you 5 rage. its a wonderful feeling when you get 2 or 3 crits from all 3 hits since it costs 10 rage :D
---
we're getting to start with 1.12.1 talents, so that crit -&gt; rage proc will be there from day one
---
they haven't talked about PvP but if it were to mirror the old system you better believe that you'll have to play 20+ hours a day to get rank 14.
---
Wouldn't the missclick mistakes be fixed with a simple "Are you sure you wish to loot [item] to [player]?" prompt, this solves the issue in a way which doesn't affect how looting should be in classic. If you manage to somehow missclick twice on prompts in two separate locations then it was destined the loot wasn't going to the intended person.
---
Hehe no worries, I was referring to /u/JosefTheFritzl
---
that's the reason why dkp is stupid on its own, and should be paired with LC
---
Swords if you're human, axes if orc. I'd say it's negligible as to what you pick if you're any other race. That being said there are probably more Axes to find than Swords.
---
Someone already ported some wow zones into vr chat didnt they?
---
well, no other ally race but night elfs became able to whip up some druid magic, so thats how itll affect me
---
duo leveling is very efficient, 2 mages for example can do some crazy AoE pulls, warrior + healer is also so much more efficient than soloing. Any more than 2 and you'll be competing for quest objectives too much.
---
Wife &amp; Husband with extensive vanilla experience and open raid times looking for..
---
* Horde
---
* PvE server
---
* DKP
---
* NA
---
* Semi-hardcore/hardcore
---
Are you sure there really was 2500 concurrent players on the server? Having the cap didn't mean servers were full. I think you played on low pop server.
---
It's funny because NoChanges originally stands for "Don't implement modern shit into Classic". Somehow over the last year the definition changed in various directions, mostly by people who want changes to the game and mostly to shittalk NoChangers "Because they don't know what they are asking for".
---
NoChanges never was a movement of people who want a copy of private servers.
---
not a bad idea
---
Noone takes into consideration, that Classic may have infinite lifetime. If that’s the case, time played as a measurment in such cases becomes non-existant - prepare to play the same account for at least the next 15 years and re-think if that is still such a stupid/unreasonable idea. 
---
Blizz told already - if they launch Classic [which they do], there’s no exit strategy for them. Meaning they will keep Classic up until someone (OP I’m looking at you) is playing it ;-)
---
If you get aggro, it's a 50-dkp minus
---
because he T H I C C 
---
You would need to spend 64 hours on your bank alt to make up for the 4 hours it takes to get to level 10, and that's if you're using sprint every time it is off cooldown.
---
I definitely agree with you in general, but there are a couple specific things that stand out here to me.
---
First, it seems silly to me to bother with consumables even back then for Lucifron.  Your healers and Magic/Curse dispellers can either keep up with healing and dispelling or they can't, even for its time back then.  For that matter, consumables for practically everything seemed like, and still seem like, placebos or small optimization things to me, but it made sense for its time back then.
---
Second, it's clear to me it was intended during Razorgore to fight each wave of enemies that came.  Razorgore himself can do a very considerable amount of damage to them during Destroy Egg's lengthy cooldown.  I remember thinking this back then, and now I basically know I'm right.  There is no way the raid was supposed to just sit and do practically nothing 90% of the fight.  That's stupid.
---
However, I know how people did the fight back then because I was in a coupe raiding guilds.  The issue back then is that people were bad and just didn't want to actually play the game.  Even now throughout Final Fantasy XIV's lifespan, people try to find a way to avoid playing the game as much as possible.  I didn't understand it back then, and I never will.
---
All that said, I totally agree with you.  It's a real damned shame that the experience can't be truly preserved/recreated, but that's just the nature of an MMO.
---
I live in the US and my work has me working in prime raid times here (3-11 PM pst). Oceanic server times would be ideal for me, so my question for you is if the latency I'll get playing there is worth it? I've never played on Oceanic servers before either, are they just as active as NA/EU? 
---
True
---
Will feel brand new at first for sure.
---
Sadly I played both factions to 60  in Vanilla so I will not be able to get your same experience.
---
I love your maps! Duskwood is my favorite zone I can't wait to see it finished &lt;3
---
Classic does look better on these screens imo. I have a MacBook now with usb-c ports only now though so will probably not go through the hassle for it
---
It literally dropped on my first run when I hit 60. "Friends" talked me out of rolling on it because paladins get a free mount, assholes. 
---
Just do 2H and hamstring kite everything. Combined you'll be able to kill stuff continuously without stopping to eat or drink.
---
I will level a Human Warrior and a Gnome Mage. 
---
the butthurt is strong!
---
Install all the things.  Sort the viruses out later.
---
Mods! iDylo! Delete it! You suck enough to delete something like this.
---
Why make something original when you can wait a day and copy other people’s work? 
---
I am doing the same man, going to swear so mutch not finding my way in thr capitals lol

There not daying "fire mobs"?
---
I'm curious what he said now... 
---
And He was the original guild breaker!
---
But how will you be feeling playing a traitor to the Horde?
---
My question would be will the scarab lord mount be available again? 
---
They have internal change logs dating back to the 1990s.
---
Nut
---
Never corner an animal
---
You nailed it. Druid is not effective if you try to be another class....  That's like a warlock only using shadowbolt because he wants to play like a mage and a mage doesn't have dots. You have to play like a druid and use all of the tools at your disposal. It's actually very engaging and rewarding.
---
Yeah I was really referring to things requiring client database changes like the same item changing between phases (or the stuff you mentioned).  Easy to do on the launch servers with the client and server in lockstep but a new fresh server wouldn’t have the phase 0 client anymore.
---
lol you’re not wrong! Stable 130 FPS is soooo nice.
---
I’d prefer if they cater to people who actually play their game
---
I had a lvl 20 enchanter horde side, and lvl 51+ gear was selling for much less than the mats it DEed into, so I'd DE it and sell it for huge profits. (there was also some profit at DEing other item levels)
---
My mains were alliance (PVE server), so how to launder the money? Buy rare and epic BOEs and sell for 1c at the neutral AH to my wife, and then I would sell it. I was very wealthy in Vanilla. 
---
I don't know how much of the valuable BOE gear I siphoned from Horde to Alliance side this way, but I suspect it made the balance a little weird
---
With most people it stems from not being able to avoid buying useless stuff on the auction house or spending every bit you get on superfluous skills. If you're generally conservative with your gold then by 40 you should easily have enough to buy a mount. 
---
And their laugh !
---
Played lock so I allready was an outcast.
---
Gone be nice to have BoS man.
---
Cross realm battlegrounds ruined BGs for me :(
---
My favorite thing was seeing players *from my server* in battlegrounds. That rogue that ganked me in STV? Now he's topping the charts in arathi basin, and I definitely won't forget his name when I see him around on realm forums / wpvp. Friends you grouped up with while leveling? Now you run into them all the time in bgs!

Battlegroups immediately killed all of that. I hate the whole "private server babbies don't know what they're talking about" but I'm having a hard time understanding why else there are so many people in favor of xrealm bgs. I don't think I remember *anyone* being happy about them when they came out, except I guess hardcore bg grinders who just wanted a fast queue pop.
---
How is this different from LFD?? Convenience vs community. Same with realm populations. If you want impersonal convenience, that's what retail is. This is exactly why WoW went the route it did. Let's not repeat the same mistakes!
---
/rant
---
Our discarded iPods have been Modcasting!? We need John Connor.
---
If you are a pandabear as a druid to you transform into a human?
---
/huff first though. 
---
People complaining about the inconvenience is exactly what led to things like LFD though. We wanted to get into bgs faster, so Blizzard delivered that. Then we wanted to get into dungeons faster, so Blizz gave us that too. Why the fuck are we doing this again?
---
I'm honestly shocked that the people who I'd expect to be so adamant about server communities over convenience to fall so hard on the convenience side of the spectrum here.
---
I ran Strat UD in vanilla. I ran it into TBC. I ran it in Wrath. I've killed Baron well over a thousand times. I have never seen the mount drop. If Classic claims my life the way original WoW did, 100% I am getting that God damn mount. 
---
For raiding fury warriors, deep wounds or no deep wounds? Not having impale will kinda suck. I realize there's a debuff limit and not sure if deep wounds drops off easily enough(is it low priority). 
---
What I've gathered from peoples comments about sharding the starter zones, they are either worried blizzard will use it in other things as well, or they dont even understand how it works.
---
With 2 party members, each kill gives you half xp. Even if you're killing at 2x the speed, you're often going to run out of nearby mobs &amp; wait for respawns, or spend more time traveling.
---
I've never gone warrior or priest so I can't attest to them, but there's a good reason you don't see speed-levelers going duo.
---
I literally never had this problem in vanilla and all I did at 60 was pug battlegrounds. I maybe ran into the premades once or twice a day, and honestly it was kind of awesome because I got to see people with legendaries and full tier 2 and shit.
---
Anyway yeah, did not have this problem. And I was on a tiny server.
---
Is it confirmed if that works on official? I've heard some say that doesn't work for getting reckoning stacks in actual vanilla
---
I did this from about 19 to 48 in Vanilla with 4 friends, we did the odd bit of questing in between when we were logged in at different times. I remember it being quite effective and really wasn't that far behind the hard-core levelers.
---
thats when classic comes out
---
I'll 100% be leveling 2 toons to 60 (shammy/priest) maybe do one more if I get bored. That alone will easily take a year + getting them raid geared etc.
---
Pre-raid will be easy enough. Aim to group with melee &amp; hunters and you'll have less competition for cloth gear.
---
For raid gear, most tier is itemized for healing, and you'll have tons of competition for cloth. Some has +damage, but you might want to plan ahead to find what slots you should just get +stamina and other pvp-relevant stats, instead of holding out for spellpower
---
Boe: need if you need it, greed if you don't. Offspec you ask if you can need against the main spec needers.
---
Bop: group decision on need roll, if some one actually has a use for it, they take it and equip it then and there, if they don't then you down tools and begin the process of rage, total group meltdown and ninja accusations, including and not limited to, contacting offenders guild master and spamming trade chat for the next 45 minutes. 
---
Stuff like shadowfang should be all need. It's an expensive twink item that you really shouldn't waste on level 20. 
---
Any guild that lets a class roll on a stat stick that another class will be swinging is doing it wrong IMO, I wouldn't join that guild. Some exceptions can be made if you have some new recruit, and some vet hunter who just needs zinkrohk to stop running zg.
---
It's only mandatory if you're planning on being a hardcore top 1% raider. The only way your profession choice could "totally gimp" you would be if it left you with no money.
---
\#nochanges is a meme, so we might as well make the server the best it possibly can be :)
---
Their threat generation is extremely weak in comparison to warriors 
---
You could be a prick and be mining and enchanting. You can slide into spots like ZG solo for the ore, and solo dm North farm for large brillz. 
---
 Or you could be lw/skinning and kinda have some usefulness.
---
 Or you could herb/alch, for the obvious reason that not many people do it plus you can farm hard to reach nodes for the same reason on mining. 
---
 None of these things will rez your fallen Bros though.
---
So what blizzard is doing is not custom stuff?
---
Anyone that's played on a private server knows that there it only two options.
---
One release fresh servers.
---
Two, transition into TBC or some mix of the above.
---
After vanilla hits Late AQ40/NAXX it really is a slow death from that point. 
---
Engineering is the best profession for everyone if you're min/maxing. Literally everyone. A purely optimal raid would have 40 Engineers. It makes a bigger difference in PvP though. If you want to ensure being welcome as a Hunter in PvE though you have an easy avenue: Swing a Nightfall. Hunters are the best Nightfall wielders. 
---
Honestly though vanilla raiding is going to be easy if your guild isn't awful, people are going to care more about you showing up on time, having consumables, not dying, etc. I wouldn't worry about it, play whatever professions you want to. 
---
Thats why you have to screenshot it.
---
screenshot the ninja looting.
---
What good is that gonna do in Trade Chat?
---
You can with Prat addon, or you can post it on server forums/guild discords etc and spread the word.
---
Its not difficult at all.
---
It all depends on the recipe/enchant. If you try charging me 2+ gold for +9 stam to bracers my mats, im gonna tell you to fuck off and tell my guildies your not worth dealing with.
---
And then what?  Post it in a forum that 5 people are going to read before it's buried?
---
&gt;Abusing loottrading may as well be generally accepted by the playerbase. It's not 2006 anymore
---
Yeah, in the age of min-maxing people will be perfectly okay with people ninjaing loot.
---
My prediction is that they won't.
---
You're assuming that addon will work in Classic.  I also assume that the people who receive it need to have it.
---
Post it on the forums only for it to get buried, if people even look there.
---
I think disenchanting the blues is a big part of making the gold in Mara/Tribute runs.
---
Well, I don't know what kind of experience you have, but I generally pay attention to those kind of things so I can speak for myself.
---
But if the entire playerbase is 10 years old and completely clueless about everything, then sure you can get away with ninja looting which you can anyway, grp lead can just set ML on 10% hp of  boss HP and ninja loot everything.
---
I think we should remove ML as well tbh, and stick with personal loot + non-tradable.
---
Look like the shins of an undead. If only the pants were torn it would really sell it.
---
Yeah server merges can be disruptive but I agree they solve the problems caused by low populations in a manner that is ultimately less disruptive than the server's top end players/guilds character-transferring out (and potentially upsetting a new server) and that doesn't place the onus on a player to fork out real money.
---
Yeah, people who didn't play the game for 14 years obviously have a more accurate view on the game.
---
You make me feel old mate! 
---
Sure, leveling alone is faster on paper, especially if you can get ahead of the server launch 'pack'. But if you aren't ahead of the pack or want to take a more casual approach, I would say duo leveling is a much more realistic approach. You sacrfice xp/hr for higher survivablity, sustain, margin for error, easier time in WPvP, and more importantly--having fun with a mate!
---
&gt;On the other hand, it is likely not true for the majority of the players in general.
---
The game has been based almost entirely on raiding for 14 years, so I am very confident in my prediction that it will be. Even with a influx of non-pserver players.
---
? Go back to retail? Retail for me was Vanilla and TBC, since I quit in WLK. I guess you didn't raid much then, the UI to give items in master loot was built for mistakes.
---
Yeah, or Blizzard can just host both type of servers.
---
Huge longevity server and hipsters servers, and we will all be happy (unless the hipster server playerbase starts crying about their droughts).
---
They should just cancel any plans for TBC and do OSRS route.
---
TBC is good to an extent, but it has a lot of flaws, especally in terms of the "world" outside of raiding, and as you said that perticular expansion is awful with a high pop because Outland is way too small to support it.
---
Was that the one from ZG?
---
ez high warlords gear
---
Even if they could using a 3 HT or even 2 tank strat each tank can have shield block active for every hateful (shield block pushes crits/crushes off the table)
---
1 out and 2 in stable
---
I remember upgrading from 512 to 768 MB RAM and actually noticing the improvement in WoW back then.
---
Currently I have 40 GB RAM. Should be enough I think. :D
---
When the classic servers open, wait for like 2 weeks. Open the realmlist, click on pop, scroll down the furthest you can on low pop. And you can have your own vanilla experience back from the day. Then everyone else can play on the server they want to as well.
---
Alliance: okay  
---
Horde: insufficient
---
I have had druid as my main alt class on several vanilla servers (mostly used them to tank and still tank mc on one every week, horde side) and currently play druid on a tbc server. Vanilla feral is so much worse and so limited. Yes they can do a lot of jobs but their design is lacking.
---
A lot of the points brought up here by others like "high threat" are only applicable if the warrior tanks are still stuck in a 2005 mindset. 1.12 warriors can do a lot of things people didn't consider feasible back in the day. On my warrior main I only put on a shield if I drop below 40-50% hp.
---
Close, it's level 35 for max skill.
---
Well stuff like that 90% (in my experience) of the time every ones rolled on it, then who ever won the chest usually gets asked if the mats can be passed over because they actually need them, and every ones ok with that. Rest is vendor trash. 
---
Wow has VR support these days!? That amazing! 
---
From what I understand it depends on your raid composition. The safe bet would be to not have deep wounds, but if your raid is not filling up all 16 debuff slots then deep wounds is better.
---
How engineering is the best proffesion for PVE?
---
I don't think you can change loot type in mid-combat.  
---
People will also more than likely stay in a group that's rolling need on gear, because then he has a 20% chance to get it, and they're already there.  If it changes to ML, they'll leave immediately because they have no chance to get the gear.
---
My experience was when this went live in WotLK.  I remember abusing it (because why not?) and I remember it being abused.  I don't ever remember any repercussions on either side.
---
You are able to buy arrows from the AH, just you will have to spend gold non-stop. You can always skip flasks etc if you are playing casually, but you can't skip the arrows.
---
For 2nd best, I would pick LW or Alch. 
---
It's a cave...
---
I doubt that. In 4.3 LFR the situation quickly degraded to the point that people would need on everything and then barter at the end. Rolling on behalf of a buddy was common as well. It was gross. 
---
God damn diminishing returns.
---
&gt;I would love an option like this. With a 3k cap, I'll have no clue at launch that my server could be dead by late AQ40 - 
---
Yeah, and when you do hit 60 you won't even be able to figure out whether there will be guilds suited to your preference/scheduling, and if you take a break for a month or two you will never be able to be a part of that progression tier.
---
3k was fine on retail because min-maxing wasn't really a thing, and nobody (not literally) were raiding, since it was all fresh and new and  people were exploring. In 2019 people won't have that shit, people want to raid and do content without quitting their job/school entirely and with a low pop server the chances of being able to do the content you want is slim.
---
Unless you already have that shit set-up before the game even launches, in which there wouldn't be an issue anyways.
---
Your comment is about on par, though, no? 
---
This is fake, all people had red ms bar in vanilla /s
---
You just got juked dude
---
&gt;I don't think you can change loot type in mid-combat.
---
You can.
---
&gt;People will also more than likely stay in a group that's rolling need on gear, because then he has a 20% chance to get it, and they're already there. If it changes to ML, they'll leave immediately because they have no chance to get the gear.
---
Thats why they change it when the boss is low HP so its dead before people have time to react/stop dps.
---
&gt;My experience was when this went live in WotLK. I remember abusing it (because why not?) and I remember it being abused. I don't ever remember any repercussions on either side.
---
I remember ninja-looting that stupid sword in ToC 5 mans for my DK, and then not getting into Sartharion's lair (or whatever that raid is called, 3d raid), which was one of the consequences I suffered because the rumour spread.
---
Can’t do solo tribute without BS or engineering.
---
Sure just send me a message with details and i can give you a time estimate ☺
---
Member when blizzard cared about its players? We member
---
&gt; Most people in this sub understand the problems that loot trading will bring on Classic
---
please explain in detail how loot trading will be implemented.  
---
and while you are already looking into the future, who is the next musician that will die?
---
LCD's were pretty awful back then.
---
Don't think they were that expensive, and you'd have to be an idiot to use one for gaming.
---
But weapon skill doesn't matter in instanced PvP, so the weapon racial benefits Orcs and Humans have don't matter. But you think that Axes are better?
---
Yeah I remember most of that except the no LFG. But the game was pretty easy, especially the leveling process in wotlk. Really looking forward to classic!
---
And what is the problem with spamming one spell, once a week, for 2-3 hours ?
---
Raiding was never about using multiple skills and facing multiple mechanics in MMORPGs...it is now, this is one of the reasons (among many other) MMORPGs are dead as a genre.
---
Raiding was about a bunch of people getting together and smash bosses faces, or getting their faces smashed by bosses.
---
Nothing more, nothing less.
---
AND IT WAS FUN !
---
A word that today DOES NOT EXISTS in gaming.
---
There's a huge spectrum here. Some servers never PUG'd a 40 man raid boss. Some servers PUG'd into AQ40 and even a few Naxx bosses. I expect that PUGging will be fairly commonplace in Classic. Especially since there are going to be many old player returning who don't have time to raid regularly and who will group with other such players. 
---
Wasn't there some windmills in the area as well ? That would add a little bit diversity :)
---
Actually old enough to really get into the Min/Max aspect of my character and hopefully see all content through naxx.
---
When I played vanilla all I was too young to do anything besides run around elwynn forest kill boars and buy white items lol.
---
Why? min-maxing means using every advantage you can get, so if you can get 3 rolls for an item instead of only 1 why not use it? It's not like other people can't do the same, and if they don't they're just chumps anyway. What matters is getting the best gear in the most efficient manner. 
---
Not sure which part of what I said you are doubting.  The first form of loot trading in wow didn't allow need roll items to be traded.  Was added in frozen throne expansion.
---
Funny how fans can create a better, more artistic view of what these developers could ever hope to achieve, blizzard has gone so downhill that something as simple as customer input has gone out the window
---
One item that's worth 1000g doesnt equate to a random boe green. I'd kick anyone who needs on EVERYTHING. 
---
I played back in the day where there was no oceanic servers on about 300-400 ping. I must say going from high to low latency has been amazing but not the end of the world, if still works :)
---
Nah, roll a fireball sorceress and get a bunch of magic find gear together.
---
100% This.
---
Beast slaying was legit, it was such a fucking con when you think about it, people spamming /1 in low level zones "selling red weapon glow 50s" or how ever much. Vendoring good greens to pay for my red swords on a hunter. 
---
Why archive? Petopia has a classic section since some time now!
---
And still is; Petopia has a classic section since some time now!
---
We can only hope that they implement Legion/BFA macro system. It’s a near mandatory change that should happen. Vanilla macros are scummy. 
---
Well, Goblin Sapper Charge is a free 18k damage (minimum) per fight. Toss on that it is area and suddenly a lot fights become much easier. This really applies to all the grenades/explosives. The whole raid is just doing essentially extra free damage. 
---
Then you have the Gnomish Battle Chicken. An Engineering only Trinket that essentially gives your entire party 5% melee haste. 30min CD, 2min duration, the buff lasts 4min. Worth noting the buff does not always happen. But basically for the purposes of fights if everyone is an engineer, this has extremely high up time for all your melee. This buff was actually raid wide for a while and was exploited more in later expansions then it ever was in vanilla, but it was very good.  
---
There are class specific perks, like Force Reactive Disk being an excellent AE tanking shield for Warriors, and some other perks as well, but the gist is it essentially gives you "free" abilities that your class would otherwise not have. 
---
There were also two 20 mans though, Vanilla didn't have to be only 40 mans if they continued it. A mix of 10, 20, 30, 40, maybe even more would have just been nice for variety.
---
Dont sweat it, the people who are GENUINLEY racist I always just put on ignore and move along. And I know what your talking about, the discord was/is straight cancer. Once in a while some banter and jokes can be funny but when its nonstop 24/7 it's disgusting and can hinder your experience. I totally get it bro
---
What a boring and useless thing to do.
---
But do what you feel is worth your time.
---
Had three Level 60 characters in Vanilla, but I was basically a no-lifer back then. Hoping for one decently geared 60 in Classic at the very best.
---
That's a big no from me, sir. After having played Horde for 14 years it would just feel so wrong to suddenly kill them in BGs. I guess I am totally Horde at heart. Lok'tar ogar! Also: Gnomes are just annoying. Don't want those cocky little things by my side. And Night Elves have blue hair. That's just silly.
---
What. Mulgore is dope! Favorite place for me. Love Tauren but I get tired of their animations
---
Whoa there. Not criticizing: it's just that as someone who was only raiding weekly in WOD it's a far cry from the Pyro-Crit dance so it's strange so see the bar so simple is all.
---
”Free” 😂
---
Art imitates life.
---
That's just clever use of game mechanics! Do all elementals do magic damage?
---
Sorry but, is your computer A XBOX?
---
I'm so torn. I like Tauren and Trolls almost equally, with Trolls edging them out slightly, so when it comes to making a shaman, I cant decide. Tauren are better for minmax but I kinda just want a troll, especially since I feel that'll be more uncommon. At the same time, War Stomp is a helluva racial... I'm already set on making a Troll Hunter and Warrior, so that leans me to Hayden but...
---
...Trolls, mon...
---
You are possible to do masterloot in 5 mans right? If I remember correctly people did that for bosses they had loot reserved for? Could be wrong.
---
Yea, the best used CRT flatscreens were actually selling for more than their new price here in Sweden att least for quite some time. The first 120hz LCD was released in 2009 I think. And even getting down to sub 10ms came a few years after LCD started to take over. 
---
tbh this post says more about how the community works rather than exploiting bad examples of trading loot...   
---
simple, if some one from the same guild does this to you in a pug group, call em out and dont group with them..  (same way you do with ninja looters) remember, this is vanilla, there is no cross realm, you build your own reputation on the server...
---
Looks like Garr’s room in MC. 
---
yea, that past nostalga will fade within the first week when ogr/if is full of lvl 60is in pre raid bis gear
---
I do think it was better in vanilla, but I wouldn't get overly excited. A big part of the slow relaxing leveling and gearing up people remember is because of how few guilds were chasing after the end game at release. There were a few old Everquest guilds coming over and racing there, but a lot of people who ended up in hardcore guilds didn't start there. When I rerolled to join a guild on the same server/opposite faction it wasn't just a slow process to enjoy leveling and slowly gearing up. I leveled as fast as I could (which was slow because I am bad at leveling), and I think I just ran enough dungeons to get keyed for whatever raid content was going on so I could gear up that way.
---
If they leave MC and Onyxia as the only raid content for a long enough period of time you can go slow. But there will certainly be guilds leveling up quickly, mass running dungeons, and trying to get into raids ASAP.
---
It's not 1% drop rate but 0.1% tho
---
* Zooms in to go from 8 fps to 15 fps *
---
What an amazing period.
---
due to server sharding.
---
Say you take 200 hrs from 1-60 on each character.. That's 1600 hours of leveling. Good luck
---
This wants me to watch Ronja Rövardotter (Ronia, the Robber's Daughter).
---
Ah. That's why I said "doubt" rather than "you're wrong". I didn't play WotLK but did play Cata and the loot trading system in 4.3 was awful and encouraged people to roll on things they didn't need, whether that was because they had hopes of bartering it or because they were doing it to protect themselves. I saw people end LFR runs by trading items they won but didn't want for items someone else won but didn't want. 
---
Some are freaking out that because it is technically possible in some weird scenario that it will happen all the time.
---
People need to take a chill pill.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Not as silly as giant cows and skeletons. 
---
Couldn't agree more, especially on the LFD part. It makes no sense that people will give up community for fast BG queues but that's not ok for PvE? 
---
Couldn't agree more, especially on the LFD part. It makes no sense that people will give up community for fast BG queues but that's not ok for PvE?  How does that make ANY sense?
---
Yep, I think so. Played Alliance from 2004 onwards, this time I think I'm gonna see how the other half lives.
---
This! And taladril guide about Druid tanking
---
&gt; For me it comes down to Bg's are just a way for me to have fun.
---
Ok so if dungeons are just a way for me to have fun, they should add LFD to vanilla then so I can instantly get into the fun? Screw community?
---
Accidents are not problems.  There is no problem at all.
---
I LOVE fighting premades. Beating BAD premades and making fun of them on the server forums, or on vent etc was great and fun to brag about.
---
I remember me and my friend making a full premade AFK out of WSG because they couldn't cap the flag for 30+ minutes and it was wasting their time when they just wanted to farm honor.
---
I could say the exact same about LFD. Should we add LFD to vanilla too? 
---
No, because I'm not running ads on it.
---
&gt; pfUI has a successfully working focus functionality in vanilla?
---
pfUI makes a additional ui frame for your focus target, like in later patches /focus command does. 
---
[Shameless self promotion](https://youtu.be/3SjFPNl9v88) 
---
It already exists !! 
---
According to the 2007 version of the "Thousand Needles quests" article, there are a total of 4 quests at the Mirage Raceway at level 31. 5 if you count one that sends you to Nesingwary. One level 33 quest. Everything else is 35 and up, with some of them taking place in STV, Ratchet and Badlands. I have no clue how you're supposed to gain an entire level at 30 around there.
---
Yeah, I'm completely shocked too. One of the most complained about aspects of retail WoW is the lack of community and one of the things people long for the most is small tight-knit communities vanilla gave us. However, these same people are OK with community killing cross-server bgs?
---
But LFD isn't ok?
---
....Just what?
---
Yeah, kinda like that, but my macros have links in combat to intercept (and if in another stance first berserk stance and intercept). I regularly use the same button to change to berserk stance, when charge in, since im in combat, i know next press will change the stance to berserk (and my finger is on that button already so its convenient).
---
Yeah, i dont like the automated rage etc macros, im fine with /cast priority lists that will do things in order.
---
Seeing all of this is giving me flashbacks to vanilla wow, when people were making all the same arguments. Only back then we didn't have the knowledge we do now of the long term effects of these changes. It's no surprise retail ended up the way it did! Clearly without a heavy hand of guidance we'd end up right back there again :(
---
Its not because you drop out. Some ppl have done earlier parts and have run out of the instance + want to keep on going. That thing that you need to do outside the instance (multiple of those) will result in the desync i mentioned. 
---
Maybe have the "go talk to the guy" should teleport inside the instance like in other quests. Now when people are in the different stages its bit rude, wait here for 15-20 mins, while i go run around the map getting the next stages.
---
&gt;Not knowing that holy fire/smite spec is fastest until lvl 45
---
Yes, but if you factor in alt-tabbing, going back into the game to course-correct, alt-tabbing again, course-correcting again and so on a corpse run can take up to a full three weeks.
---
Why does inflation matter to you ? Its just a number when you talk about items, craft materials etc. It always comes down to gold / time. It doesnt ruin the game, it makes fixed price things like epix quest easier for people and thats it.
---
Now i get what you mean. Yes i agree completely when you say vanilla is casual. i would like to add that vanilla can be as casual as you want it to be or as hardcore as you want it. Because the game's content did not mean exclusively end game, but the whole journey which was enjoyable as hell. In current wow you are in a way forced to login daily to do your checklist (dungeon daily, world quest. weekly expeditions, weekly world boss, weekly LFR, Daily BG, Weekly arena, weekly honor cap). This gets quite boring after a while because its a forced loop that has no variation nor freedom to it. while in vanilla casually leveling got you through memorable moments and that alone got you between 120 to 250 hours of game time on 1 character class.
---
While i favor the emphasis on the leveling journey approach vanilla took, in term of expansions alone, i prefer the hardcore aspect of TBC over the casual aspect of wotlk only because it still felt rewarding to put in the time and effort.
---
In wotlk it felt like there was a participation trophy just for playing. I personally never liked the zerging aspect of wow or the difficulty scaling that kept creeping its way to every aspect of the game.
---
I do not like to do the same dungeon on 9 difficulties to get the same gear pieces with slightly different numbers on it. I don't think i can name a single item in the game from 71 to 120 other than some legendaries.
---
One item worth 1000g equates to 1000 boe greens. 
---
&gt; a lot of users (myself included) have been conditioned to mentally filter out stickies because most subreddits have them 24/7/365.
---
I know for a fact that there are two stickied posts in this sub, but I couldn't tell you which they are to be honest.
---
I can REALLY see history repeating itself, it already is on these forums. I'm seeing the same complaints I saw back in Vanilla from people who probably never played vanilla. It's really depressing.
---
"We finally made it to Southshore Beach, and let me tell you... this place is *AWESOME*."
---
I agree with the bags, but you should definitely consider buying a weapon on AH if you're a melee class or a hunter, because the leveling speed will weight up for the amount lost in gold. This is only the case if you care about leveling fast.
---
To me if there is no end game then what was the point of leveling to begin with. A carrot on the stick as fine but I never get to nibble at it then what was the point to begin with?
---
You should read this:  
---
[I will level A-60 completery in VR, HMD &amp; Treadmill.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9x4iza/i_will_level_160_completely_in_vr_hmd_treadmill/)  
---
Melee classes and hunters should definitely consider buying a weapon off AH if they can find a bargain. It doesn't have to be a blue weapon just the right stats. 
---
Some blues BoE even last you a few levels and are worth their weight in gold, no pun intended.
---
Part of it is also that since there were only 16 debuff slots you couldn't make full use of your toolbox. As an arms warrior I was not allowed to use mortal strike, rend or spec into deep wounds because those debuff slots were needed by other classes 
---
Horde has zero quests in Redridge.
---
Did you made a full map of Azeroth and Kalimdor ?  
---
I which i could make a poster of them. And tips you for the job !  
---
What's the fun in that?
---
Nah you get one
---
No rogue though, it will just feel hollow and incomplete.

I just bought a brand new in the box CRT monitor off ebay, for classic wow / retro PC games.

Can't wait man.

Theres like 6 real low level areas, if the server cap is 2500ppl. Since some are more popular that would result around 500 in human, undead areas without sharding. With sharding they could cut that to 50-100 per area. Additionally it would keep the same numbers on EACH starting area.
---
Meaning human/undead might have different 5 shards, while taurens might only have 1. 
---
Sharding doesnt mean you soloing the start quests mobs without contest. With sharding on, you will have to camp spawns. Its there to keep server stability AND not make it like the screenshot OP posted.
---
I used to have a 21" crt behemoth. That thing was beautiful. It ran at 100hz (even higher at lower resolution too) at 1600x1200 with or something around there. Super smooth great colors. And I want to say it had a max res of like 2000x1500 or some really funky resolution.
---
It was given by a family friend because the base was broken, they were in graphic design or something so I'm sure it must have been expensive af when new.
---
It's hard to believe but only in the recent years I can say monitors have surpassed that old behemoth. Very high refresh rate, great color, zero input lag, hi-res.
---
Many a night were spent playing quake and age of empires on that thing 
---
Nope, Blizzard has cut the support part of their staff down significantly, there is most likely going to mostly automated responses besides for bigger issues.
---
So you figure they havent seen the thousand previous posts, so you made another ?
---
How dare people make a living?!
---
Are you sure you can have alliance and horde on same account tho ?
---
Its really nice free tool. This is a map I made myself for my d&amp;d campaign: https://imgur.com/gallery/H1c5OtB
---
I made 4 smaller maps and added them together and did some additional effects over it with gimp. The paid version has some really nice tools to make stuff look even fancier.
---
And then you go on your realm forum and call out Sal for being a no life little bitch and from then on you and Sal have beef and there's drama and it's awesome.

They are viable on private servers. They weren't as viable in Vanilla, but some Druids tanked in Vanilla (not during raid progression) with mixed results, usually failing.
---
Now, why Druids are much better on private servers compared to Vanilla?
---
Most people will say because Vanilla players didn't knew what they were doing...which is wrong. Yes, many players back than were clueless, but top raiding guild players were not.
---
Druid threat (like Fury Warrior's), as opposite to Prot Warrior threat, is based mostly on damage done. Druid tanks never generated more threat than Prot Warriors in Vanilla...but they do on private servers. And this is because on private servers, you can stack armor debuffs that lowers a target armor to zero.
---
Such stacking wasn't possible in Vanilla, and won't be possible in Classic.
---
That alone will remove one of the reasons to use a Druid over a Prot Warrior : better threat.
---
Druid's HP pool and Armor value are, on paper, superior to Prot Warrior HP pool and Armor. However, the Effective Health Points (EHP) is what that matters, and Prot Warriors have the best EHP in Vanilla.
---
Physical armor reduction from Armor is capped at 75% in Vanilla. A druid will easily reach that 75%, compared to a Warrior...but the Warrior doesn't need to reach 75%...only 65%, which is easily obtainable The 10% damage reduction from Warrior's Defensive Stance makes Bear Armor superior value irrelevant.
---
And this removes the second reason to use a Druid over a Prot Warriors.
---
The same 10% damage reduction from Defensive stance translates into 10% more EHP. A Warrior with 9k HP vs a Bear with 11 k hp actually means that the Warrior have 9.900 HP. The 2k HP Bear advantage is reduced to 1.1k.
---
Druids cannot block and Parry. They need to stack defense, armor and stamina, to make up for the lack of Shield Block and Parry. But they will never be able to reduce as much damage as a Warrior does, simply because Shield Block removes Critical and Crushing Blows from the table.
---
Druids will never reach defense cap, and they will get critted and crushed. Warriors don't even need to reach defense cap, because Shield Block is enough. Parry negates 100% of the damage...and Druids cannot Parry. Warriors don't have high Parry Values, but they still have like 12-15% Parry, which means that they will basically negate another 12-15% of the incoming damage.
---
Because of Shield Block and Parry, Warriors negate the minuscule advantage of HP that Druids have, making Warriors vastly superior in terms of survivability.
---
The main problem that Druids will face in Classic is that they are SLIGHTLY better than Prot Warrior in terms of threat, but far inferior in terms of survivability, while in the same time they will be behind a Fury Warrior in terms of threat, while being SLIGHTLY better at survivability.
---
And the Fury Warrior will STILL be able to use Shield Wall, Last Stand and Lifegiving Gem trinket.
---
In other words, during raid progression, Druids will fall behind Prot Warriors, and during raid farming, they fall behind Fury Warriors.
---
Not to mention that Druids don't actually have the gear for proper tanking until after BWL. And even that gear is not enough to make up for the difference. The pummelers do help, a lot...with threat...but since Druids will tank AFTER overgearing the content, they will do plenty of threat w/o the pummelers.
---
Now, for 5 and 10 men, Druids are more than viable tanks. Offtanking trash in raids, again, Druids are more than viable. Same for 20 men raids, ZG and AQ20, because of overgearing the instance.
---
Druid tank is viable...but after overgearing the content. But after overgearing the content, Fury Warriors do it better.
---
Druid tanking is more than niche.
---
Dude, both huge cows and skeletons really *do* exist. They're not that silly. 
---
Back than when I was on an rp server I did tons of research for the horde. So super important.
---
Really liked Thrall. So I had an orc myself and planed on playing shamen. 
---
But since in my rp guild we had too many I switched to rogue to role play the leader of our scouting party and assassin. 
---
So garona became my main focus.
---
Later on that kind of died a little. Although I will not roll on an rp server again, I plan on an w3 marathon and re-read a lot of stuff. 
---
Not for rp but just for my own pleasure. 
---
Depends what you are doing:
---
- Princess + Tinkerer = 28 g/hour
---
- Princess + Tinkerer + Rotgrip (not doable for warlock without very good gear) = 32 g/hour
---
- Running from purple to princess with herbalism, killing methlok, cerberas, tinkerer, princess = 25g + 15-20 ghost mushrooms per hour (so 50+ g/hour)
---
Blues will DE into small brilliant shards which are worth less than vendor gold. Large brilliant shards are not worth much either. There is no reason to have disenchanting on your main character. 
---
Those gold values are based on the loot tables of the bosses and drop rates and assuming maximum kills per hour (except for purple runs which cannot be done faster than 3 per hour due to the insane amount of foot travel).
---
The dungeon is always available. You can just make a group.
---
In BGs you can't influence the other fraction. You can have your group ready, but still need to wait. Especially when the fractions are unbalanced or it's not prime time. That's the difference.
---
I was super happy about crossrealm BGs because they enabled me to do more BGs and also provided BGs for low-level brackets. On my server it was even hard to have AV before crossrealm BGs.
---
By the way, we also remembered groups and players from other servers since the pool had a limited number of servers.
---
And that's the entire point of my post, you wouldn't even know if any wrongdoing has taken place.
---
GM’s = -$ = Mad bobby = No fun = No social interactions between GM’s and players.
---
How so? 
---
&gt;If so, then look further!
---
Just fyi the saying is usually "look no further" as it's sort of saying you've arrived at the place / thing you're looking for.
---
So idiomatically "look further" would sort of equate to, 'keep looking because this isn't the thing / place you're looking for,' instead of 'keep reading if you agree.'
---
What if Classic went in a completely different direction? Just like how oldschool RuneScape is adding new content that.
---
I could see them creating new lore, zones, etc. But keep the level cap the same and instead we are going for items/content. Seems to work well with RuneScape. This is of course in the far future.
---
Wait... Are those sand lobsters?!
---
Mulgore is beautiful :(
---
Maybe if they program humor into the A.I.
---
You are dumb. Top guilds knew exactly what to do. And oh, they tried Druid tanks in raids. All did good for trash...but were pulverized by bosses.
---
Druids take TO MUCH DAMAGE. Not worth having them tank raid bosses until the raid is on farming status, and healers can actually afford to spend enough mana to heal a Druid / Fury Warrior tank in speed runs.
---
Thanks for the great responses everybody. I got the answers i needed!
---
My idea was to get him there kind of fast (within the first few days) to sell the random green items you find on the way mostly. When a good hard day of lvl'ing is over, ill log to him and make some cash. Just feels natural that the hero stays in the field.
---
I was asking about the actual runtime to city, and not distance between auction house and mailbox (who could say no to IF or ORG).
---
I'll give you 5 dollars
---
Moonglade Teleport (dudu spell)
---
So you want the most op healing spec? Strong spec in pvp and make tanking viable? This is not unicorn-retail land where everything has to be tuned to your exact needs.
---
&gt;dual wield fury/prot warriors are just wannabe bear druids &gt;.&gt;
---
Most serious 'tryhard' MTs are primarily dual wield fury/prot warriors
---
You're doing gods work my man, ive had a lot of fun with those VR maps you and Puffycheeks make. Keep up the good work!
---
Thinking of doing the same but really not sure...
---
I was Alliance for Vanilla and BC.
---
I switched to Horde near the end of BC and really nolife on this side until wotkk.
---
So alliance side is really a long time ago now...
---
I saw a Rogue tanking MC.
---
Dude, it doesn't matter what you saw...the ONLY VIABLE TANK is Prot Warrior, for ALL the content.
---
Druids and Fury Warriors are used for SPEED RUNS, where a raid overgears the content so much, that THREAT &gt; SURVIVABILITY.
---
But when a raid overgears the content, and uses a Druid or Fury Warrior...that is IRRELEVANT for tanking. It's like a lvl 60 (insert any class) is soloing SM Graveyard, and hence, they are VIABLE tanks.
---
Tanking is tanking during progression. And no Druid will EVER be able to tank better than a Prot Warrior during progression.After progression, tanking is no longer tanking. Its just stomping.
---
Play it and see.
---
You are aware that the sapper and the chicken are from different engineering types? And the chicken has its pros and cons - if the proc doesn't happen and you aren't a hunter - you are stuck with the trinket for rest of the fight.
---
Troll have blue hair too
---
I'm the same but with Alliance :) I first thought about trying Horde but it would just feel so wrong. I'm even having trouble deciding if i can play anything other than dwarf paladin but i think the nostalgia is too strong..
---
I probably did 200+ Strat runs for Baron mount in Vanilla.
---
Never got it.
---
You have to kite and kiting req a bit more clicking, also hunters have 2 button rotations instead of one, like mages/locks. 
---
I would go for a lock.
---
 With your amount of excess time (can you give some to me haha) Warrior shouldn’t be much of an issue. I mained Warrior from Classic launch all the way to live. (Although I have quit because BFA is hot garbage.) 
---
The biggest issue was farming. It took me CONSIDERABLY longer to farm gold or mats for consumables. It got easier with BWL+ level gear but if you have multiple characters especially Mage/Hunter you should be able to farm more than enough to support a Warrior. 
---
Now it does take longer to gear a Warrior if you are trying to gear for both roles. They were the best tanks and the best DPS in Classic. I personally find Warrior to be one of the most rewarding classes to play in Classic and would argue they have the highest skill cap. 
---
My personal plan for Classic is to level a Mage first and farm a substantial amount of gold. (Enough for mount/epic riding, bags, decent leveling weapons, and blacksmithing patterns/mats). Then I will level a Warrior and main it again and just use the Mage for farming/occasionally change up for pvp. 
---
*mindblown*
---
LOL, it appears my excitement for classic has rendered me a bit blind!
---
It was supposed to say “look no further” but I must have missed that on my proofread. What an unfortunate part to miss as well. Thank you so much for pointing this out to me!
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
what do you want to do? If you only want to level, farm and chill, go for a bestmaster hunter, in theory that's a 0 button class.
---
For raiding any ranged dps will work
---
May i ask how old are you and how much did you play to develop that desease.
---
Anyway back to the question. Any ranged will be ok. I would say chose a class with cd on most of its spell and long cast time. So afly lock would be an option. Just load up dots on everyone and keep it up. 
---
I hope blizzard will do some class tuning in the back to close the gap between rogues and the rest. 
---
I had the gun, because of my bad luck for the xbow but there are better range weapons for rogue and fury wars.
---
Yes, don't judge me. 
---
Hunter or paladin.
---
You keep repeating this same point, it doesn't make it true. 
---
Here is a very in depth breakdown that Taladril did on Tank mitigation and threat that you should read 
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRVNabnxWQoq4Ya\_cNDMKuZJwf9zbfzWhe3qf6d08gEk3OuJJ\_z\_zgERPRaDioAGux14ORx6thE6Hub/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRVNabnxWQoq4Ya_cNDMKuZJwf9zbfzWhe3qf6d08gEk3OuJJ_z_zgERPRaDioAGux14ORx6thE6Hub/pubhtml#)
---
It has nothing to do with boss armor and it is not a little bit difference in threat. With MCP up or  Dual Wielded with Death Wish and Enrage up it is over 400 more threat per second than a Prot Warrior. 
---
The only use for Prot Warriors is early progression before people have T2 gear or if you are in a casual guild. 
---
Sapper Charge only requires Engineering to use and is not BoP. You can just have other people make them for you. Plus you can have all the BoP items for both specialties for the low, low price of leveling Engineering twice. The proc applies to your whole group, being "stuck" with your raid doing more damage on average is fine for min/maxers. Also Rogues can Vanish swap it and you can trigger it OOC before a fight, then swap. At least you could in vanilla, I've never played on pservers so I don't know what the meta is there. 
---
The 8 debuff limit was a problem for spriests, but remember that they will be doing 16 debuff for Classic. This means there will at least be invited one spriest for raids to buff warlocks.
---
I do understand your point, and it *is* a problem for hybrids (I mained oomkin in vanilla). Do understand that I'm not trying to fight your opinion, I actually wholeheartedly agree that it's a big problem that a few classes have specs you either can't play or have to pay 100g per week to do both PvP and PvE.
---
But my point is that while dual spec solves this problem, it destroys something else in the game. It is a poor fix for hybrids being horrible at anything but healing.
---
I can't bring up another way to fix it, because anything I can think of will impact other parts of the game too much. I guess you can be happy with at least being more viable than in vanilla with 16 debuff slots for all raids.
---
Me and my friends will play The Horde since all of us played Alliance in Classic. Just to make it feel as new as possible =D
---
&gt;You are aware that the sapper and the chicken are from different engineering types? 
---
Yes, but sappers aren't bound and most people who are concerned with this kind of min maxing are gnomish for the chicken.
---
&gt; if the proc doesn't happen and you aren't a hunter - you are stuck with the trinket for rest of the fight.
---
You can swap it after you summon it and it'll stay alive- so long as you prep it before entering combat it'll stay out and alive for its full duration.
---
That being said, a bloodrage will a warriors chicken on a rampage towards the target, which I've seen wipe a raid a time or two- I think that's the real con.
---
No he won't unless he/they want to level in the pack or behind it. Doing the 4 dungeons for the quest is really time consuming. Not eaven sure the warrior will have wirldwind axe getting the groms blood might be hard
---
What are they gonna do when this is the only thing they find exciting?
---
Looking for a late night guild that starts at at least 9 PST
---
NA
---
PVP
---
Alliance (Will go Horde if i can find a great community)
---
Raid times 9 PST start at least, i intend to play alot during my time off.
---
Just want a great goup of people to raid and pvp with
---
Contact via PM or discord Kandanarne#1947
---
It's just one guy posting them tho.
---
I want to play Vanilla. Your ideas would turn Classic into something that is not Vanilla.
---
first and foremost is authenticity as our goal
---
we want to create an experience that feels just like 2006 World of Warcraft
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811
---
If you plan on taking Classic this serious I think you'd be better off finding a guild in advance with a lot of other people who will invest this much time in the game. This way you can choose/discuss which class you will level first and have a guaranteed raid spot. It will also be nice to do quests &amp; dungeons with guildies when you're all ahead of the pack. There are nine classes and four have your intrest so I doubt it'll be a problem to work something out.
---
I don't know any hardcore/prepping in advance guilds but I'm sure you could find something that suits you through the weekly posts on reddit or somewhere on Discord.
---
Let's have all 45,000 guilds post their recruitment posts here.
---
I'm levelling a paladin whit a friend rolling warrior for us it was easier for him just to need on every item that was a upgrade for him and I just agreed on everything. This is mostly because the will do mor damage especially sins he have charge and arrives at the combat alot earlier than me and I loose alot of dps healing the warrior 
---
Nope. If I wanted a brand new game I'd be playing a brand new game. I want the nostalgia experience.
---
I'm only going to play one Alliance character, and he'll be a Horde spy hiding in Stormwind disguised as a Gnome.
---
Amen.
---
This.
---
If you want to be good at PvP at 60 a healer would be your best bet. Shaman's chain heal would probably be the easiest. Aside from rogues basically everything can level easy with the right macros, so mostly I'd recommend just researching that for now. Enhancement, cast a few totems (cast sequence with cooldown) then shock and wait on mana regen for a bit. Also, a PvM sever would make things easier on you.
---
ONe

WoW didn't have huge numbers when it was released. There was no massive open-server rush. People started playing it gradually. What you are seeing in the OP is a uniquely private server (and official WoW expansion) experience. 
---
Yeah but mapBro is based
---
No where near enough aesthetic addons with the default layout cluttering the screen
---
Trust me. It's far from being that simple.
---
Ever since getting my HTC Vive I've wanted them to add VR support. Imagine combat while actually moving your character, I'd imagine they never would because how would you balance it if it was OP and in raids it would be hard as fuck to see fire and stuff like that :/ 
---
Haha! Good one :) You should use the /s though. You sound too serious. 
---
Paladin is your ideal class until 60 - drop a seal on the enemy and autoattack - but if you wanted to raid you're going to suddenly need to spam heal *a lot*.
---
As others have said, hunter is also a solid choice.
---
Have you looked into pedals? It might sound silly on the surface but my uncle had two foot pedals he used to play some random MMO a while back. He also had RSI and just put his main two abilities on those and played with his feet. 
---
Can't wait for this one, Duskwood is one of my all time favourite zones.
---
I think especially for this particular zone the color you end up choosing will be extremely important. Too lush and it becomes like a normal forest at night, too violet / tear / blue and it becomes night elfish or draenei-ish. Needs to be just right to get that "not just a forest at night, but a place of horrors" feel.
---
World PvP, dungeons, BGs, exploring. Raids have realistically never really been my thing. 
---
Beastmaster hunter does sound pretty chill though. I'll look into it, thanks
---
Most of the trinkets that are pets etc are bugged on private servers. Outside cables I never bother to use something else very often. Maybe bombs when a stun was req.
---
You'll impress anyone who doesn't know about leveling guides. "Woah! I don't think I could hit 60 that fast if I played 24 hours a day!"
---
Level some of them simultaneously maybe?
---
actually its 0.01%
---
#nochanges is an easy mantra to recite and is mostly obsolete now that we knew blizz isn't fucking the game up. the biggest problem we have is loot trading which is completely minor.
---
you may also be surprised to learn that being "pro-choice" doesn't literally mean liking choices.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azrefd/looking_for_group_monday_march_11_2019/
---
Hmm that's a good point, technically long cast times equals slower pace. It makes sense then why I think the classes like rogue are a no go for me with all those instant abilities. 
---
I'm 26 and played/work a lot but I think it's just luck whether you develop RSI or not. Most people are fine. For me I must be prone to it. 
---
Yes, except for earth.
---
So everyone seems to just jump on the chance to hate on Blizzard (not saying they didn't put themselves in that position, but that's off-topic).
---
But I feel like there is a much bigger reason why we won't see those kinds of GMs again. Everything has to be political correct and everyone is so extremely self entitled and butthurt. Honestly, even if we had the old Blizzard we all love they couldn't do this anymore, they'd get too much flak.
---
In vanilla the internet was a lot different and honestly those kind of things could slide way easier. This is one of those rare times where Blizzard is not to blame.
---
yeah please post more classic wow content for a game that comes out in half a year and has already been discussed to death for the past 15 years
---
Used to do this all the time in AV right outside the alliance base. Was hilarious. 
---
I have been playing private realms since TBC was live, I have only ever seen it drop ONCE in 15 years.  I must have run 45 min run at least 100 times not to mention all the non-timed runs.  The one I did see drop was the ONLY one to drop on a realm that was live for 5 years, although a low pop realm. IIRC there was not a single drop on Nostalrius even with all those players.
---
Just spending time fishing in IF/SW was such a nice way to pass the time while conversing in /g. Heck even /2 was full of lols
---
Okay
---
&gt; A purely optimal raid would have 40 Engineers
---
While that may be true, it would also mean that the raid would need to rely on alts or other players for *every* other profession related item. Or players who choose two main professions in lieu of a gathering profession would need to farm even more (or again a high-level alt).
---
And in the end, as you say it, discipline and playing the encounter well is more important. I remember we often managed to get a first on a boss on the last try of the night -- when many players were low on consumables.
---
He is saying that items won't change.
---
No one knows for *sure*, because Blizzard is not perfectly clear but I'd be *really* surprised if they did change anything. They said they only had the 1.12 database to work with. They'll content gate some items but the items will not change.
---
So technically the release progression is quite simple/easy and if Blizzard wanted to repeat it, they could without hassle.
---
I have to give 3 months notice for summer vacation, it really sucks since I have only like barely 3 weeks left to submit it :( and still no release date.
---
I'd rather discuss the newly dubbed phase 7 a thousand more times than have this sub reduced to minimalist art and shit memes tbh
---
If I was you, and I had that amount of time to burn and definitely wanted to play a warrior, I'd make him my main and be the MT for a guild. You have the time to commit to raiding very regularly and getting the gear/experience necessary to become a great MT for a respected guild, which is a big deal on Vanilla servers. With enough luck and time invested you could be wielding Thunderfury.
---
If you level a hunter first with that amount of time to play you'll be so far ahead of the curve that you might find it hard to get many groups at endgame for a while, so unless you're happy switching immediately to a new character, maybe maybe the hunter last, if at all. Personally, in your position, I'd go warrior MT main and then pick one DPS class and one healer, so you get a great variety and could still pick a hunter/mage/warlock as the DPS. 
---
You were a clicker?
---
And now after last night, You won't even need the xbox for reach.
---
THIS a million times.
---
Underrated? On private servers everyone uses wind serpents 
---
Honestly, I feel like how they handle sharding is going to be how I judge their capabilities to actually know better than the players. I've always been an advocate for "players only think they are smarter, but the devs know a great deal more". BfA have taken that hope away from me for retail, now I want to see if the Classic devs can do better.
---
Sharding is a very risky move, but done right it *can* be the right decision and make the launch. I'd say it depends on how long it last, which zones and how many shards. It *should* feel crowded at a launch, it's should only be there to avoid people still being level 2 after the first day.
---
And it should *not* be in zones further than level 10. Having played on a pserver with no sharding launch and more than blizz-like population, once you get past level 5 it is better (still some quest are non doable, but you can grind and do some stuff). After level 10 you can quest confidently, but still with a lot of people there (as it should be at a launch).
---
Idk why you feel compelled to think this far in advance tbh. Leveling 4 characters to 60 is a massive task and will almost certainly change your opinion on the latter classes to level as you do your first 1 or 2.
---
Nope.
---
This is by far the best idea I've seen! If people want to be sneaky about it then they can't trade after the raid, and everyone in the raid will see who the loot gets reassigned to.
---
I'd also give this a 2-5 min window so shady rolls can get checked on the last boss.
---
How would I rogue in VR. Man that would be insane but I'm so damn tempted
---
the grind to finish the quests. you need to kill like 100 mobs to finish all of them.
---
Thanks for the input. Main Tanking as a warrior does seem very cool. The thing is even though I’ll be able to play tons of hours, I might have a week here or there of having to travel/having odd hours where I could miss a raid, infrequent  enough I should be able to raid ok, but maybe not MT. Also I’m interested in getting dps gear for pvp, and very interested in both warlock and mage pvp. Maybe I could offtank? Hmm
---
But there’s a mob there that nets you, making you unable to move or escape unless you’re a Gnome 
---
Blizzards old light jokes have nothing to do with pc
---
Well I’m trying to plan things out but I actually will not rush through the game while leveling/having never played private servers before, so I don’t really want to pass up the feeling of exploring with other players/etc. I’m not actually worried about minmaxing/getting in the top guild as much as planning which characters I’ll play when.
---
Itis people's faultfor upvoting these stupid maps. I have no idea what they are excited for? I went to that map website and re-created Elwynn Forest in like 10 minutes. What? This guy is just farming karma point from people's stupidity.
---
I used to go around Elwynn doing this all the time xD

To be fair, when I post something about how the progressive content release can be sustainable on the long run I get maybe 1 upvote (if I'm lucky) and the thread gets downvoted to 0. If you post a low effort meme you get 500 upvotes.
---
You get what you upvote on reddit...
---
That's a bold statement.
---
Fair enough, I think it’s mostly the hunter that creates the feeling of wanting to know early, because it’s weak later. Probably I’ll level my warlock first, but I’d rather level my hunter next after that (if not first) or not at all.
---
In actual vanilla basically every person in my guild had a gathering alt, yep. That was just pretty standard. Especially in TBC when everyone was Leatherworking for Drums and another crafting profession because perks were better. The way I used to put it my guild is you always need an alt as a resource, whether that is a bank alt to play the AH or an alt you play. Pick whichever is better for you, but have an alt. The few that didn't basically ran instances or found other farming opportunities (we had a player who sold winning the Fishing Tournament every weekend, she'd log in to your account and win it for you shhhh don't tell Blizzard). 
---
For the TBC Leatherworking thing we actually paid people to pick up LW. A guild that really wanted to be optimal in vanilla could probably do something similar for engineering. 
---
The Rake also has very fast attack speed and high damage. 
---
I see many of us agrue Master Loot-enabled gives the possibility to loot-trade is a good choice. If I add that you should have a "ready check" that forces the group to accept Master Loot inside the instance if some thinks of switching mid-instance. That would seem like a fair way of doing it. Where all agree throughout the process!
---
Hope understand what I mean. 
---
I really love these! Awesome :) 
---
Besides Eng and mining you could go skinning + LW or herbing + alch or just keep 2 gathering professions. Do whatever flys your zeppelin. 
---
Missing the little island between Ele/west/DW
---
Yeah, he's a great early option and Mulgore isn't as populated as most race's starting zones.
---
TOo true
---
Look at that mob though - JoW, JoL, Shadow Weaving, Immolation, VE, Improved Scorch?!
---
I'm not sure if people think he's actually hand painting the maps or something? That would be worthy of the upvotes imo. But it's so easy to do. 
---
I think any reasonable guild won't mind a week here and there where they need to use the OT to MT, especially if you're normally playing so often (you'll likely be running people through dungeons a lot but that's an MT's other job). Remember that warriors also *absolutely crush* in PvP at 60, and with a mage or hunter to farm on, you could easily respec on a whim with the amount of gold you'd be making, especially after DM drops. Then, if you've still got the time, level a Warlock as a third! Honestly, I'd just focus on your main to start, it might change your perspective on having many other alts. 
---
You mean Duskwood - Worg in Progress
---
Why didn't you share it with us?
---
So true.or imagine demon hunters!! Double jumping onto tall buildings and dashing an insane distance. 0.0 freaks me out just thinking Bout it. 
---
i had a fun interaction with a GM in BFA(around when Uldir came out), so i’d say its possible but I doubt it will be as common as it was then. 
---
Nope, stop trying to re live old times lol
---
Layout is wrong 
---
No thanks, I’d rather just have a good game 
---
To maintain his monopoly. Its right there in the post. 
---
so classic wow was fun due to it being hard and encouraging you to communicate and be part of the community to get through the normal questing stuff, much like how the OG guild wars encouraged the same by limiting leveling to 30 and making quests far above that so people would form guilds and make communities?
---
what of classes? because i love my shadow priest and my warlock, while i do find i can do most of my questing by myself in zuldzar, i think its cheap that you can switch between all three disciplines of a class, though i may be just thinking that classic locked you into one sub class.  
---
one thing i worry about is Blizz putting back the warlocks old soulstone system, i hated how that worked, only getting one by killing a enemy with soul drain that are on you level, at least that was my experience with wrath
---
I want to play a shaman and pvp with friends in battlegrounds once they come out, but I am worried that if we queue together we may end up in separate groups in the BG raid and then they won’t get totem buffs because they are group wide. Can anyone put my mind at ease or should I perhaps look at a balance/resto Druid instead, them not getting my buffs in a battleground would be a deal breaker for me
---
Fair enough! Definitely as a new player this will be a special experience for you. Especially given the time you will be able to invest. Still my opinion would be to reach out in advance because you will still end up ahead of the pack and it will be nice to have a friendly guild where you can ask all your questions etc. There will be guilds who will invest a lot of time in the game without being min/maxers!
---
I will tell you this; if you havn't played Classic before and you're planning on playing 60-80 hours/week be prepared to get adicted to this game. The immersion will be surreal. There will be that 'just gotta finish this...' 'just gonna run here...' which will keep you playing longer then you want. :D 
---
I read the comment on being MT in a guild. That seems really nice but it also requires someone to be fully commited to the guild and their progress. As a fresh player that doesn't seem ideal for me. My two cents: start off with a (frost) mage. Easy leveling, easy finding dungeon groups, great utility, great for PvP + early raiding, great farming potential. There will be plenty of mages but if you are in the first group of people to ding 60 you'll be allright.
---
No, but there's a few unique pets (i.e. unique models) to go after if you want something special. 
---
I used to use Petopia back in the day, now it's been updated with Cata+ content so I'm not sure how accurate it is but you could cross-reference with a vanilla wiki.

Lol man i cant wait to see the circle jerking the day the game comes out.  Its already at a crazy high level. 
---
I got him on a private server on a level 13 Night Elve. Was probably the only NE/ Alliance with the Rake on the server. Never had a moment of regret, the Rake is a great pet. When I was level 18 non twink, I beat an undead lvl 19 mage twink in a 1v1. So it's worth getting.
---
&gt; In actual vanilla  
---
&gt; Especially in TBC
---
I'm geting mixed signals there.
---
I mean, sure, later on you have another character or two at sixty, but given given how long it took to get there, I think most guilds were well into BWL (or still wiping at Vael) before more than half of players had an alt at 60.
---
I know that I was being laughed at for having engineering, and I don't think *anyone* had two primary professions, except for the tailoring/enchanting clothies – and our MT who powered through to 300 Engineering after the force reactive disk recipe dropped. 
---
Theorycrafting, new(not really new) meta is maximum tps tank eg troll/human fury dual wield. 
---
Either join the BG queue as a party or raid and you'll have control over that. That should certainly not be a consideration when choosing Shaman(or not)
---
Shhh, don't tell everyone :P

Hey guys, I’m going to be playing a lot with my friends, a tank Warrior, Warlock, and Hunter.
---
I’m always the healer but I’m having a tough time with my choices for what to play with the group.
---
PvE isn’t my goal and not my passion, so I’m not concerned with a raid spot, though I’d like to do them eventually, so here are my thoughts.
---
Druid: I’ve always loved druids, I love healing with HOTS and how it makes them unique, but I’ve heard they have terrible mana troubles, obviously no rez for the PvE content.
---
Paladin: Have fun cooldowns, really good buffs and fun auras, good mana / heals, but I don’t like having to buff every 5 minutes, the lack of mobility in fights seems unappealing to me in pvp.
---
Priest: Seems to be a good middle ground, has a HOT, has solid mana, bubbles, but they don’t seem like fun healers in PvP because I would think they lack being able to protect themselves.
---
Please add any experience you guys have, or any comments about something I’ve missed or listed incorrectly; keep in mind my appeal is BGs, where I shine.
---
Well I'm gonna have to disagree. I went through half of the armor on that site to see what upgrades happened. There were plenty, yes. But none of them that I saw fundamentally broke gear progression. Even the staff you listed and also Rosewine Circle I saw were big upgrades from what they used to be. However the next logical item that you would get is the next closest raid. Cauterizing band wins instantly and Jin'do's Hexxer plus a healing offhand wins every time. So does it make it easier? Yeah a bit but the point isn't to make the content harder. If so there are far easier ways to do it than to act like a little more healing is going to be the raid breaker.
---
The point of worrying about the 1.10 items is the items specifically designed to be raid ready and ones that significantly bypass the raid progression that's there. Everyone's favorite item: https://itemization.github.io/1.10/armor/head/spellweavers-turban-22267.html
---
Now that thing is insane. I don't know caster gear very well but I can't imagine how high you'd have to go to replace it. AQ? That's a jump way beyond anything I saw for 1.10 upgrade pieces and I think that's the real point of this.
---
There won't be GMs in Classic, sadly.
---
I also had no smart phone, guess I have to get rid of that too if I want to play classic. I also had no wife or children, guess they need to go too.......
---
Pretty sure I know just about everything there is to know about Classic (played Vanilla and private servers extensively with both classes) but I'm still stuck between Mage and Warlock. I'd be Gnome either way. I'm leaning Warlock because of Class Scarcity.
---
Talk me into or out of either one. I'm certainly a better Mage, but that's likely more from experience than anything else.
---
I know exactly the door you're talking about. I should have probably just replied what I thought was the correct answer instead of trying to double check from Wowhead comments.
---
Wowwiki says:
---
*"This item opens the Shadowforge Gates and the East Garrison Door‎ in Blackrock Depths."*
---
So the Lyceum door is not included in that list, and when I was first writing that earlier comment my first thought was to say that the door will automatically open after you defeat the Summoner's Tomb (7 dwarves) boss encounter.
---
Wowwiki also says the following about the boss encounter:
---
*"Once the dwarves are defeated, the Chest of The Seven will spawn, and the doors will open, allowing access to the last areas of the instance."*
---
So I was just being stupid and trusting some random Wowhead comment in that first reply thinking I was remembering it wrong, when my train of thought is probably correct and you just have to defeat the previous boss encounter.
---
To start the 7 dwarves boss you first have to talk to one of the NPC's there, so your group probably didn't know it was a boss encounter or something and that's why you couldn't get through the door.
---
I don't know, some of the old top guilds were pretty dumb. Those ElitistJerks guys seemed to think Sunder Armor, Faerie Fire, and Annihilator armor debuffs all stacked and made their melee dps spreadsheets under this assumption. You have confirmed for us that this is not the case, and it is only a private server bug though.
---
They must have been pretty dumb for wasting debuff slots on these, and not realize their damage wasn't going up. 
---
I played vanilla before but I barely hit 60 before BC, so I’m a newb to the actual level 60 content. I was also like 13. Got a lot more experience with the game in BC and wotlk, although I was still a kid. But I do have an idea how addictive it can be!
---
That’s kind of what I was thinking regarding main tank. And also even though I won’t be a nub, I’m not sure I want to have 40 people (many of which will be private server veterans based on my leveling time) depending on me studying the fights to such a severe degree since I have zero vanilla raid experience. 
---
There isn't much to talk about in r/classicwow ... the game isn't even live yet, so, a lot of topics are dull and irrelevant.
---
In r/wow, even if the game is live, there isn't much to talk about, because the content is irrelevant and nobody from Blizzard gives a flying fuck on what retail players want, so, a lot of topics are dull and irrelevant.
---
Once Classic will be live, there will be A LOT of topics that will be relevant for the game.
---
I wasn't going to upvote it, just wanted to see your work.
---
I'm open to changing my mind but I don't see how spriest would beat SL assuming equal skill, priests have 0 damage reduction against magic spells except for racial/ shadow protection buff (which will probably get dispeled) where the lock has 30% + 60 to all resistances from MD on top of racials. Short of just getting insane blackout RNG I don't see how you have the tools to win. Lock has better CC deathcoil, fear has no CD, silence has a shorter cooldown, spellstone and has more health + defense, and the big one curse of tongues.
---
Spriest has a worse fear (although undispellable long CD), worse silence, more mana problems, a shield (which is awsome to be fair) a dispel, (which again is great but you can't dispel curses and curse of tongues is gonna make your life hell 60% slower casts sucks when your only instant damaging options are dots), mana burn is awesome but again 60% slower cast makes it nearly unsuable. Unbreakable will could help some but like blackout very RNG.
---
Jesus bro, chill. People upvote a picture they like. Doesn't matter if it took a month or 5 minutes to create, people like it.
---
Like i'm all with you once classic is released that there needs to be discussion and actually useful posts here, but there is nothing to really discuss right now and his maps are pretty cool. I don't understand why this would anger you so much.
---
Won’t all the good pvp gear go to fury warriors though (the dps gear)? I like the idea of getting a pvp reward from raiding, and I was kind of assuming If I was the tank and getting prot gear, I’d have to pass on juicy 2handers and t2.5 till the fury warriors have them.
---
I want to be able to melt faces with a Spriest and have heard/seen videos of them absolutely dominating in PvP .
---
Do you think I can also get away with raiding as a Spriest or will I be forced into healing ?

So late reply but ... yes.  I really liked healing as a priest especially on MT/OT.  However, the one thing I really hated was dispel heavy fights (mainly chromaggus) because at least on horde it is mostly on the priests to do it(no paladins to help).  The one thing I didn't like about hunters in vanilla is the fact most fights are mainly reliant on the tanks/healers for success.  Some fights do have DPS checks but many fights seem to be decided by whether the healers keep up the tanks which makes it seem like your job is more impactful.
---
Do you have a source for this? The thing is blizzard did not mention that detail in their announcement. Just that it will be possible for 2 hours I believe.
---
Because if what you say is true, then there is no problem.
---
Better late then never? Well, I read this news 10 times already, gotta be faster, if you want audience. 
---
The blue post has been done less than 18h If I am right, trying to help the Vanilla community as I can 
---
Never really used scripts in vanilla, I was a young scrub. But I'm down to script now, what exactly does that one do?
---
Oh shit I thought it was one guy drawing them 
---
No u
---
There were a handful of people that still had gathering professions on mains in vanilla. They were the exceptions, at least in my guild. Come TBC they ceased to exist, everyone was double crafting. A lot of people did have gathering while leveling, but they transitioned away from it. Bear in mind I played EQ and transitioned to WoW with some of those people. What we ended up doing in WoW that most people who played considered pretty over the top was like... not even half of the time spent on doing stuff in EQ. 
---
You mean like the community manager lore? 
---
I'm struggling between 2. I love warrior and Shaman. 
---
I won't have much time to play per week maybe 15-20 hours or so. 
---
The reason I want to be a warrior is I love the class fantasy, I always play the warrior archetypes in RPGs and I love having the biggest armour, and biggest baddest weapons. I don't mind tanking either and enjoyed my time up to 40 ish with my Vanilla warrior who was an alt. 
---
Shaman because I can raid and PvP with one spec, I love bursting people and healing I did back in vanilla raids as a paladin so that doesn't bother me at all. Also I think the Shaman armour sets along with warrior are the best looking by far. 
---
Other things to consider is I will be on a laptop with an unoptimised set up so many buttons and ability bars will be a hindrance for shaman but will my play time allowance make for a miserable warrior experience? I really can't decide. I'd love to tank raids but not sure if I will be able to commit a lot of time for it. 
---
I thought I locked my choice down but looks like I'm having second thoughts recently and would love some help regarding this!
---
[/classic\_content\_plan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/azv3g6/classic_content_plan/)
---
Whilst it's sad that people have lost their jobs because of these systems, I can honestly say I don't remember the last time I had to speak to a GM so the systems they have in place are clearly working. 
---
Shame you aren't going Horde because Shaman seems like a great fit for you. 
---
Also because of blessing of freedom Paladins can be very mobile as well just food for thought 
---
Nah, that’s a picture of Firemaw a boss in BWL. Not all BWL bosses use fire attacks so people would take their fire gear on and off. And sometimes forget to switch. Then again, I think I was wearing Carrot on A Stick when I beat Ragnaros once soooo lol
---
I want to play ally but my friends will roll horde 😉 So horde it is! Loktar ogar 
---
With that kind of time to spend i would 100% sure main a warrior and try getting rank 14 on it.
---
But what i would suggest is to start with your main char, because you want to secure a good guild with a good raiding spot (and gear early). If the guild isnt going far enough (naxx), its very simple to change to a new one, when you are geared. Also, im a alt-a-holic too, im sure ill do 4-5 L60s in the end. Just remember to make all chars and try to get them to \~L10+. Then focus on your main, while playing ALL alts whenever you hit max rested exp on them. Private servers have usually 2x of actual vanilla rested XP gain rate, so things will be much harder to levelup and rested XP is more valuable.
---
Gearing alts will be relatively easy, im SURE there will be a lot of pug runs. Even if you dont get into guild raids ( i dont see this happening, other than that you could go pickup hunter bow q item after all the guild hunters have one ).
---
Im thinking ill do a warrior, shaman, mage (holy trinity, then i can do everything i want). Maybe a (feral) druid and hunter later on for profession CD's, so going atleast L35 on these. And rest of the account filled with L20 summon warlocks, maybe up to L35 for additional CD's. Maybe ill need two different accounts so i can summon my own chars (with help).
---
Certainly forced in to healing for a raid spot. Guilds may bring 1 shadow priest but that will be it. If you want to play priest and raid you will have to accept that you'll heal unfortunately matey 
---
I didn't say that, i said this is a change that wasn't in vanilla.
---
Sure. There are different experiences of "vanilla", especially when you conflate "late vanilla" with "vanilla".
---
Hence why I object to portraying your experience of vanilla as "pretty standard" in "actual vanilla", but apparently you agree with me there.
---
Anywho, I fully expect that things will be similar this time around and unless one is in a hardcore guild, having no gathering profession will be rare, even if not as rare as back then.
---
The pservers had to eventually guess the stats for bosses, right? Also, it doesn't make sense that you could armor debuff bosses so significantly.
---
Run for your life!
---
Its an ahk script, so it works for any game. This one spams 1 every 20ms by just holding down the 1 key. 
---
AHK scripts are the only healthy way to play these kind of games. Thats kripparians script. Search “kripparian wow ahk script” for a video about it
---
I remember Playing with a friend of mine back in vanilla, and we sent in a Gm ticket since we wanted to rename a small island i think it was in duskwallow marsh. He sent us a cool response that he wasent able to rename blizzard property, but he had found a snail in his house that day and would rename it to my friends character. Also he showed himself and waved before porting again. That was pretty cool and hope people like that are Gms in Classic
---
We had a lot of people transition to double crafting for rep grinding efficiency. That was early vanilla. It became standard for the people I played with over time. They were all high play time players, so it yeah, it was standard for my experience. Which is all I have to pull from, I've never played on pservers. We were figuring out what was optimal as we went along and, here is the key part, when we decided something was optimal we actually changed and did it that way. Of course that spanned a time period. 
---
&gt; Your raid is bound to fail
---
[Original Naxx 40 kill image](https://i.imgur.com/KMrby97.jpg)
---
I found it to be hard to manage 2 lvl 60 in Vanilla, even if one was for PvP / Farming only.
---
But you want 3-4 lvl 60, rank 13 on the hunter AND you want the Warlock to raid Naxx as well...while planning for the Warrior to have AT LEAST Aq40 gear?
---
It's going to be damn hard (not impossible) to do that. You will absolutely LOSE raid progress when you farm rank 13, and you won't get a raid spot in a guild that plans to raid AQ40 and Naxx, because you won't be helping them enough to deserve such a spot...since you will focus on getting rank 13.
---
Realistically, I see your Warlock raiding Naxx, but you won't be able to also raid MC/BWL with the hunter AND AQ40 with the Warrior. It just impossible, because raid days will overlap.
---
Sure, you can PuG MC/BWL with the Hunter if off raid days, but raiding Naxx and Aq40 separately will be a challenge, even if the Warlock and the Warrior will be in different guilds.
---
The amount of farming that you will have to do to sustain TWO RAIDING characters will be stupidly high. Not to mention that you plan the Warrior to start raiding LAST, which probably means you will have to join a casual guild with the Warrior (all top raiding guilds will have plenty of Warriors and raided together A LOT by the time you lvl and gear up your Warrior). And casual guilds won't raid Aq40...because they are casual.
---
So, realistically, I see one raiding character (the Warlock) in a raiding guild, the Hunter PuGing MC/Ony and having rank 13, and the Warrior also PuGing MC/Ony.
---
"Later" as in, after the monopoly is finished.
---
Half the post, double the karma, you've evolved
---
Without sheep in the game, being a wolf becomes meaningless. Besides, you have direct control of who you party with, if that is really such a big deal for you.
---
You would go for rank 14 warrior just because it’s a powerhouse or because warrior is really that fun in vanilla. So many people are talk highly of warrior in starting to wonder if I should main warrior instead of warlock. Ranged caster is more my typical style and I have nostalgia for warlock, but people make warrior seem more intricate and having to put more time in PVE for multiple sets and tanking all seem appealing to me.
---
Interestingly enough 2x freezing band is considered BIS for flag running by a good bit of the premade pvp community
---
Oh right Auto Hot Key, I remember messing about with it years ago. 
---
Cool alright as long as it doesn't get detected as botting I think it's mostly harmless - as you say it's a healthier way to do it tbh. If I could macro in-game, even better.
---
I'll watch the guys videos and do some research, definitely worth considering so thank you.
---
Trying to drive traffic to your own site*
---
I've found that my favorite segments over the last year tend to be the panel discussions. The guests are well informed and usually well-spoken (especially so on this episode) and I appreciate the novelty of hearing competent people exchange facts without many opinion clashes. You do a good job vetting guests, both for panels and individual calls. 
---
It's very retro in a way: "let's have a fun discussion without trying to influence the audience." Harkens back to the days before the 24/7 news mentality had completely infected the increasingly poorly educated people in our Western Civilization. I'd never considered the WoW fanbase to be a prime source of stimulating conversation and yet every time you have a group on your show I unconsciously turn my ears toward the speaker. 
---
If you have any reason to consider going dps, you'll regret not having Thrash Blade when you hit 60 and respec. The proc (at least on p servers) gave you an extra attack with your MH.
---
I agree! Unfortunately my friends have no intentions of swapping sides after all this time, and thank you for your response!
---
What's the best class for soloing high level content? Lvl 58-59 elites etc.
---
Yeah I think macros sound like the way to go where possible. I'll do some digging on it
---
Note that I was never planning on raiding 3 at the same time, I was hoping to raid with the hunter in raid 1 phase but transition to warrior sometime in raid 2 phase.
---
Thanks though, this is the kind of realism I’m looking for.
---
I'm in the same boat, doing the same thing.  Plus I couldn't play a Tauren Druid, I'd change classes completely.  Lol
---
Okay, well I guess ill just have to suck it up if I want a consistent raiding spot. 
---
I assume if I'm playing Alliance, Dwarf is the way to go 
---
&gt;Extrapolating from it that everyone in the raid was working at 33% efficiency is the caricature.
---
I never said that it's possible to do three times this guy's DPS, I'm just illustrating how even the top guilds made lots of obvious basic mistakes.
---
&gt;Like I said, if you approach it the way deniers approach moon landing videos you can find things to mock. But I do wonder how much of it is due to a lack of understanding on the part of the viewer - there's this one video of a priest healing on C'thun that idiot pirate server kids keep trying to make fun of while showing how little they know about raid healing.
---
So how does an elite viewer such as you explain the fact that this dude is playing completely wrong?
---
&gt;But as I said, *I* was getting this stuff right by 2006, and I was nothing like in the top 1%.
---
Well, that's what you think. Maybe you were not playing wrong, but you probably were not playing optimally either.
---
&gt;No, but if I'm not the one claiming 300% better performance by mashing the same frostbolt key.
---
Neither am I, stop playing stupid. As I already said, frostbolt mashing optimalization is irrelevant in a melee stacked raid. The difference is not because of bad frostbolt mashing, but rather because a lack of consumables and world buffs, inefficient raid setups (not just melee stacking - replacing a few healers with DPS gives you a significant increase in raid DPS) and suboptimal play on characters that are not one button wonders.
---
The bottom line is that the 1,5 hour clear time is not optimized at all. If you want to argue about that, show me the most optimized retail MC clear with the lowest clear time and we can discuss whether they do everything right or if there's still room for improvement.
---
Then he is extremely lucky
---
More dots
---
absolute lolz
---
&gt; Yes, I know this level of planning might seem insane to many
---
Your expectations and targets are ridiculously unrealistic
---
I didn't say nelfs made your raid fail, i said you keep throwing away small percentages your raid will fail.
---
Lets keep with your screenshot, notice how all of them are wearing a bunch of frr gear, would they fail if one or two of them didn't wear as much? probably not, but they all do because it all contributes
---
&gt;  I wouldn't be shocked if come Classic the majority of priests were Nelfs again.
---
Neither would I, but you also don't want to play with the majority of the playerbase in the first place.
---
There's a lady at my job who alternates between laughing like the rat on Catdog, and the trolls from WoW
---
Sure they could be in one megathread, but really this content, while low effort, is so much better than all the crap and regurgitated retail hate that has plagued us before.
---
When I clicked I expected a shot of bile from r/wow rather than the positive content you show.
---
Thats what I’m trying to find out! I’ll probably plan out 3 instead of 4. I know that’s still a lot..
---
Fair enough, best of luck!
---
Didn't know they let us kul'Tiran druid forms IRL. 
---
No, you made an overt assumption
---
***items such as Ban'Thok Sash will still retain their 1.12 stat values***
---
This is an assumption that the change to Ban'thok sash and similar items fits into the category of ***lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.***  
---
In contrast, rephrased what they said when i stated  ***I believe they indicated they are only going to bother doing item progression for the items that actually mattered not items with minimal variation.***   I pointed this out relatively neutrally noting that your read differed from mine.  
---
To be a bit more blunt, I believe you are reading way to much into what they said to the point of spreading misinformation.  
---
I disagree with your assumption, the change to banthok sash is a perfect example of the progression in items pre 1.10 that do have have a substantial effect on player power.  There are other examples, but the point here is that the only thing we have from that post regarding item progression is that it won't be vanilla like but will focus on items that blizzard determines in their discretion are those that the changes have a big effect on player power.  
---
I'm hope that you can appreciate the difference between a rephrasing and an assumption in light of this more blunt explanation of how I differed from what you posted.
---
Caveat: I never raided Naxx in vanilla (I'm unsure if it was even cleared on my server - Skullcrusher EU) and likewise haven't raided (vanilla) Naxx on a pserver. However, from friends/reading around, it seems Druids were the best tanks on Patchwerk for the following two reasons:  
---
1) Patchwerk can't crit - this is a huge buff for druids on the fight  
---
2) Patchwerk is a DPS check - druids generate more TPS than warriors so allow your DPS to go more HAM whilst not sacrificing tons of mitigation to achieve that TPS (as would a fury tank)
---
&gt;Then there’s the issue of crafting certain high tier elixirs which require the Alchemy table in stratholme and/or BWL.
---
That would be flasks... cant remember any elixir needing the table.
---
Maybe classicwow need to be text post only?  
---
Or just heavily moderated?  
---
Because any forum over a certain population will be pretty much nothing but images after a while unless the moderators are diligent.
---

So glad to hear you’re still enjoying the show Azzmo! Glad the guests are as entertaining to the listeners as they are to me, they do such a fantastic job on a regular basis!
---
For EU, we had a few Russians and Turks joining us for raids. Both of them are 3 hours ahead of our raiding time. We started to raid at 8 pm, and they were already at 11 pm.
---
But generally if you're not in Russia or Turkey the time for Europe is mostly the same, +-1 hour.
---
Interestingly I think Druids will have their relative power spike early on (perhaps being the overall best tanks for MC in classic, especially(!) with warriors not having access to DM gear), with that advantage rapidly fading as warriors gear up in MC itself and later BWL, then have another resurgence in a few select fights in Naxx.
---
Hunter is still your best bet
---
"For the Dark Lady"
---
Prot isn't bad at all for leveling. I mean it's by no means quick, and you can probably expect ik hit 60 sometime around 2021, but it's pretty safe from dying. 
---
Imagine being this late
---
I was thinking exactly the same... Except omen is a must i guess and recount for dips
---
Swifty was able to make use of VR in WoW. Not very good, but doable.
---
You got the model or type of pedals? I really want to get a pedal for push-2-talk, but I can't seem to figure out how to do it
---
Because back than the game was designed toward community.
---
Loot trading is a systems that WILL be used by cliques of shady players.
---
ALL GAMES have shady players...implementing a system that virtually ALLOWS shady players to exact their game style over other players is stupid, because very shortly, EVERYONE will suspect EVERYONE ELSE of shady play...and this DESTROYS a community.
---
Seems that people in Vanilla were much better players than the current players...simply because today's players need a system that fix miss-clicking.
---
Do the players today (which are supposed to be FAR BETTER than the ones 15 years ago) miss-click THAT MUCH that they need a system in place to fix their stupidity?
---
I can ask later but I can almost guarantee he won't remember (he hasn't had them for years), sorry. I think they were just some generic ones from Amazon, honestly. 
---
At least it makes a change from all the "Hey Im going to make a druid tank, I know its not optimal but blah blah blah blah..." posts
---
Sure, but you're going to want specific PVP gear anyway a lot of the time - your prot gear is actually probably going to be better as a base PVP set than DPS would due to the defensive stats. You can always buy a Brain Hacker from the AH or something. This is my very limited understanding, warriors would be better to fill in specifics.
---
I can’t imagine blizzard is going to bother considering bothering with this so that the .1% tryhards don’t force themselves to do something they deep down rather not.
---
They're using the modern engine, so 4k and ultrawide is supported.
---
Good bot
---
I would sign up for this
---
&gt;GMs in vanilla were CONSTANTLY restoring items for the MILLIONS of players across their realms.
---
You have to be kidding me. Do you UNDERSTAND what you just basically said?
---
So, in Vanilla, EVERYONE was so dumb, they were ALL rolling on items that they didn't need, and ALL asked GM's to fix their mistakes?
---
Because MILLIONS means MILLIONS. And Vanilla had MILLIONS of players.
---
Mate, you really have no idea what are you talking about.
---
On my Vanilla server, maybe twice I have seen GM's redistribute loot. In 16 months of playing Vanilla.
---
Yeah that's a Shame! I levelled a paladin in vanilla and I'll be honest the experience was difficult, just auto attack and resealing etc it's not a fun grind that's for sure. Unkillable in a bg with some skill and gear though. 
---
You will be rolling against your warrior in dungeons though 
---
I would have argued the same exact point....until a few days ago when blizzard announced they would delay DM release along with other itemization changes because some .1% tryhards recommended it would disrupt the early flow of the game
---
The 40 mount costs 2gold-ish from your trainer and gives you the riding skill to use, it costs 100 mana aswell so you can't mount if you're oom and have no hp for life tap :(.
---
The 60 mount will cost you a fair bit, maybe not 1000g, but probably more then 800g atlest. 
---
Yep that is true, in 2004 everyone was in a weird switch over / should buy that item. Flip phones were still a thing. Shoot even social media was still in its baby stages before the hashtag this or silly selfie came about. Good times!
---
&gt; You would go for rank 14 warrior just because it’s a powerhouse geared or because warrior is really that fun in vanilla? 
---
Both. You do really amazing DPS the whole of content, unstoppable in PVP with a healer and then theres tanking. You actually have 2 different roles that you are great at.
---
Warrior has the biggest timesink in levelup, pre-bis or gearing in general not to mention ranking. But it also gives out a lot to those that have the time to spend.
---
Shimmering flats.
---
No, MC at launch. 
---
*It is, I prefer it to Italics.*
---
Nothing is mandatory in the raid scene - only in the high-end raid scene, where everything is mandatory.
---
What website is it? Sounds like it would be fun to mess around with
---
No i had an xbox and PC hooked up to the monitor, dont forget xbox not the xbone had VGA converters for hooking that up.
---
straight and to the point
---
DM wasn’t originally open at launch. It was in a patch shortly after release. 
---
Well, I do think the group that would be ready to run MC week 2 is much smaller than the amount of people in this community thinking DM being delayed 2 or 3 months would help not trivialize other content,
---
Also Delaying DM can be argued as being in the scope of pursuing authenticity since it wasn’t out on launch for some people, while I believe MC/Onyxia was out at launch for everybody?
---
It would have, had Blizzard not proved lately they have a totally different view of the Horde than they did in the warcraft era. Brutal savages trying to survive in a wartorn world resonates well with me; it allows reasonable conflict between factions without either side being the bad guy, it justifies doing morally grey (lol) actions to save your people, etc. 
---
I'll just play Alliance come classic because fuck my Tauren getting turned into a massive war criminal who enjoy carpetbombing orphanages or forcefeeding dogs chocolate again. I'm saving myself from that potential heartbreak should classic start evolving like osrs did. 
---
Hahaha you must be hitting the 40 mark soon. Trust me ypur eyes will adjust from the eye memory of the sweet CRT monitor days.
---
Phase releases affect the entire population, 1-2 week MC &amp; onyxia only affects the .1% tryhard "15 years late world first" 
---
If you didn't fancy Hunter then Warlock is your second best bet 
---
He said *always*, not *most.*
---
And also comparing the launch of their first MMO ever to its *seventh* expansion fourteen years later seems dishonest. They've had time to improve things, but instead BfA on launch was buggier and far less polished than the previous expansions by a long-shot. BfA was rushed out the door despite the beta testers voicing that it wasn't ready.
---
Also this post is 27 days old, my guy.
---
When it releases, i will post an updated picture using it.

Loved the old GM interactions and all the stories that came out of it.
---
And if his friends are offline and he wants to run a dungeon?
---
Don't be dumb.
---
I'd consider getting a controller and setting up autohotkey, so that you can swap between controller and keyboard/mouse while leveling to avoid carpal tunnel.  ;)
---
Deathmaw has 1.2 attack speed I think, so you can check the attack speed of each worg to know which one is deathmaw. 
---
You need to learn the meaning of the word "abuse". 
---
Loot trading can be abused.
---
Vanilla loot rules weren't open to abuse.
---
I mean... if you know almost everything there is to know about Vanilla, like myself, then you should know the best class is mage :)
---
A lot of different stats had to be back-engineered from published stats like on the Official WoW Atlas and other publications, and based off of old 2005 era videos, etc.
---
For me Vanilla was great for the exploration of the world. I could stare at one place for ages until I actually got there and explored that zone. Along with the zone, there was generally a dungeon there. Going into the dungeons and exploring them aswell.
---
And the zones you could go into that were in WC3 was awesome, or seeing a monster named after something from WC3.
---
The lore, the mysteries that was just waiting to be explored, that is what made Vanilla great for me.
---
I want it to be authentic. People who spend the time to grind, will have the most gold even if you make every mob only drop 1 copper. Inflation only affects FIXED price things in the game, aka epic mount relative cost or to lesser extent every day stuff like buff material costs.
---
Everything else will be adjusted to how much gold you can grind in a hour. It doesnt affect the game one bit, the price is just different than you remember. You sill buy and sell the same stuff as before.
---
Herbalism and mining. Just do maraudon farm and be rich asf. Let people make your ammo and consumables. 
---
Hunter tributes are worse. Lashers mainly inject leather and herbs into the economy, while Hunter tributes inject gold, increasing inflation.
---
It's called Inkarnate
---
You use words like "need to stress" and "allow us". That's player/guild dependent. Blizz ain't forcing you to rush to 60 and start on MC as fast as possible - let those people do that if they want, that's what they're rushing 60 for. 
---
Although that MC week 2 group is certainly small, I would argue that the amount of people who DM "trivializes" the game for is also very small.  Is gear with a marginally better stat really gonna be the difference between a casual being able to kill ragnaros or not? I don't think so, but blizzard seems to agree that the affect DM gear has on its top tier of players is large enough to warrant a delay in its release.  So they do appear to be listening to that very small minority of exceptional players, to some degree atleast
---
‘In the spring of 2005’ 
---
WoW launched in November 2004. 
---
Nah there are loads of websites where you can craft your own maps, you paint on the water and mountains and can place premade items like buildings, farms, cave entrances etc. 
---
Useful for things like D&amp;D, this guy is just using them to remake WoW zones in a different style. They look nice but I think he's only getting so much karma because people don't realise they're not handmade in photoshop or whatever. 
---
Have you NOT understood that this is NOT what they said at Blizzcon? 
---
Specifically, Ion said "sorry ninja, you won't have the excuse of clicking need by mistake", which IMPLIES that all loot WILL BE subject to loot trading.
---
From memory is was introduced in WoD through till PL changes in Legion. I didn't play MoP so im unsure if it was in effect then.
---
Im not going through patch notes to tell you when it was put in the game sorry.
---
Warlocks have to farm Sould Shards, which is annoying. Mages can create food and drinks more easily.
---
Warlocks have a free mount at 40, mages have teleports and portals to every capital city.
---
Warlocks have to manage their pets, mages can ran our of mana more easily.
---
I personally prefer mage and that's what I'll most likely play during classic, but I'm still experimenting with a warlock on a pserver.
---
maining more than two seems excessive tbh, especially the amount of time you have to put into just one character, I remember I was lucky to share an account with my brother and so we would share the characters and our progress would seem to others like we had no life if they didn't realize we were two separate people and since we never told people thats what people assumed lol
---
I agree with this I just see people having fun and getting hyped.  There is nothing to talk about.
---
What have I been doing wrong such that I don't get leather from killing lashers?!?
---
And those tickets will be ignored.
---
&gt; So how does an elite viewer such as you explain the fact that this dude is playing completely wrong?
---
Which dude?
---
&gt; Well, that's what you think. Maybe you were not playing wrong, but you probably were not playing optimally either.
---
(Shrug). Believe what you like. I don't have a time machine or videos of me doing my thing. But it's not that hard to look up an optimal rotation and execute it, or download a spreadsheet and plug values into it.
---
I wonder how the pirate server supremacists think we even managed to download addons. They seem absolutely convinced that basic numeracy and the ability to use a mouse was unknown before 2010.
---
&gt; Neither am I, stop playing stupid. As I already said, frostbolt mashing optimalization is irrelevant in a melee stacked raid.
---
You're actually hurting your argument more than you are helping it. Because if the raid is doing 300% damage but the ranged DPS are still doing 100% damage, that means the melee DPS have to be doing 500% damage or something to take up the slack. Which is even more impossible.
---
&gt; The bottom line is that the 1,5 hour clear time is not optimized at all.
---
I think you are reasoning backwards from the belief that nothing about pirate server achievements can be questioned, to the conclusion that therefore even the best and fastest in real vanilla were still 33% efficient compared to the pirate server crowd. The skill ceiling just isn't that high. I don't care if the odd warrior or rogue or someone left some DPS on the table, the whole fucking raid can't have been leaving 66% of the DPS on the table if half of them are mashing one key.
---
&gt;  you want to argue about that, show me the most optimized retail MC clear with the lowest clear time and we can discuss whether they do everything right or if there's still room for improvement.
---
You don't get to make up the goalposts. If you think 300% raid DPS over anything anyone ever achieved in real vanilla is Blizzlike, then *you* show *your* maths.
---
I care
---
Perfect example of an item upgrade to that is a huge be power gain
---
Also depends on the guild, casual ones will be fine with a shadow priest, but if you want to raid at least a bit seriously you will need to heal. Which is fine to be honest, you can just hoard the shadow gear and respec for PvP every now and then.
---
That's a fair point.  Do you think though that a shortly delayed release might be more fun for servers?  Having a servers top horde and alliance guilds battle it out in Blackrock Mountain on raid-release night to be the first into MC?  In my experience it was much more entertaining than a first-come-first-serve trickle of players we might see in Classic
---
Always sort by new. Most discussions posts are not getting upvoted unless everyone agree's with it. And than its not a discussion anymore.
---
Did lasher farming even work in vanilla or is it just a pserver thing? 
---
Or ignore those tickets.
---
Which they will. Because it's cheaper.
---
I included DMN mage runs.
---
Well it does take some time to level to 60. If Blizz actually keeps track of the population (according to this sub and wow owns forum) the tourists will leave somewhere around level 10-25.
---
So suddenly people are around level 35-ish, the server just went from 2k pop to 800, same happened with a few other servers. Merge them together before anyone hits 60 and there you go.
---
Whose work is he copying?
---
i disagree, always having something to do is what made classic great.
---
"Bah, people are upvoting art that I don't like. I don't think this person deserves their imaginary points!"
---
I think you failed to understand the point I was making: Blizzard originally intended for DM to be out in the first patch of this years Classic WoW, yet changed their mind when they heard community feedback.  So it goes to reason that even though this might have been a minorities feedback in regards to their release plans, they listened and changed the gameplan.  This is why I think they might have an open ear to other discussions

thanks for this man!! You're awesome :D
---
It won't
---
I really dont like how they handle the raidlock since cata ...
---
It was kinda awesome to go into the raid with green and blue quest shit, trying to get things done, wiping hours on every Boss trying to maybe down one after trying out all available bosses. Going from green quest reward to epic T set item ... glorious!
---
Dont wanna miss that, so: Raid from day one active (Progression though)
---
Thank you for the new desktop wallpaper!!  I like your style, friend.
---
It's time for new friends.
---
You're still gonna see MC fighting even if they have a set launch date - the overwhelming majority of guilds aren't going to be raiding in the first 2 weeks if they don't time gate it. But in those first few months you're gonna have guilds from both factions whose first raid nights intersect. It's gonna be glorious chaos for a good while. 
---
Thats another mechanic that can be abused.. assign Ashkandi to the Winner and re-assign it 14mins in.
---
I’d honestly rather how it was, with nothing getting removed from my bags after the fact.
---
Ah, the great outdoors
---
Sometimes fuck-ups can be game breaking..
---
It’ll go down as soon as enough people hit 60 and get enough gear.

That is sadly a huge problem with the reddit in general..

You say that but I never saw green bar in Vanilla, 450ms was the usual for Australian players. Half the reason i’m so excited for Vanilla is playing it on Australian servers (the introduction was a godsend - I never knew how different the game feels on 60ms..)
---
This is years in the future so we have time to think about it. I like the oldschool RuneScape model. They went in a totally different direction but tried to keep the "oldschool" feel.
---
Imagine expanding Azeroth but no level cap increase -- instead we have added content that doesn't gimp old content and expands upon it. All of this should be heavily discussed with the community as well.
---
A lot better than I thought and doesn’t seem disorienting 
---
The last time I had to speak to a GM was the legion launch. I’d been locked out of the alchemy quest line due to being trapped in the Bloodsail Assault Booty Bay phase. I couldn’t leave as I was hated by Booty Bay.  It took me 3 attempts to find someone who didn’t believe that decisions made to farm rep in Cataclysm were intended to effect my progression in Legion. I had a good laugh about it with the 3rd GM, he took control of my character and completed the quest with console commands. 
---
Maybe discussion posts should be "higher rated" not by upvotes but by amound of comments and clicks.
---
I dont know.. 
---
Totally agree. Everyone needs to look at how OSRS has become such a success. The devs are killing it by adding new that doesn't gimp old content while also maintaining the "classic" feel. It is absolutely thriving because of it.
---
You'll still face plenty of premades with battlegroups. It just increases the player count participating.
---
And private servers perfectly show that a 3k pop server doesn't have half the amount of bgs pop a 6k server has. It's much less.
---
I started playing Feb 17th, 2005 and by August 2005 I had my 3rd and last level 60 char. Had a bunch of other lvl 40s tho..
---
That's when optimized anything wasn't "the meta" and information/knowledge wasn't as abundant as it is now.
---
You can level those 4 chars no problem, but ranking more than 1 char above 10 is gonna burn you out for sure..
---

I remember wiping half the raid aggroing onyxia as a warlock

It was tough without salv and 1 unlucky crit early on was enough

Google "runecloth farm spots" for you guide to get mounts. Other guide is farm stratholm.
---
Interestingly one of the original class designers, Kevin Jordan, said during an interview with [Countdown to Classic](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/03/12/episode-95-classic-news-ex-wow-dev-talks-warriors-aq40/#more-1200) that each race/class combination was supposed to get unique abilities to reflect the hero identity. The Priest racial spells seems to be the only part of this that made it in. He talked about there being hundreds of abilities that never made it to the game. Would have been interesting to see what they were. I imagine Tauren Totems would have been in there somewhere. 
---
Now we zoomed out and run minimalist UIs
---
&gt;They've stated they only intend to shard for the first week or so
---
I would say more like a month, if not two.
---
&gt;and only in the first few zones.
---
Needs to go up to 45ish at least.
---
Are we friends now? (:

We once had a GM turn up in our raid, I don't recall why.

I was wearing my Bloodsail hat, so he turned the whole raid into pirates

Maybe it should have an extra are you sure. And maybe a warning if the class cannot equip the item etc.
---
I started my campaign to get them to play months ago! They will succumb
---
You've got several options here. Most will say Hunter and rightly so. Their pet as a tank plus their ability to kite is incredible.
---
Warlock, as also mentioned, is good too for mostly the same reasons.
---
Then you've got Druid and Paladin, which both have excellent sustain. Especially if you can manage to put some distance between you and the mob to heal up.
---
Best of luck in your adventures!
---
Just stockpile shit for different protection potions and make yourself millions, easy game, easy life.
---
Oh we were most definitely *not* a "pro" raiding group. We did have fun, though.
---
The majority of gold from lasher farming comes from vendoring the gray items, most of the herbs are low tier and usually not worth the effort. 
---
The difference being that the argument was "We dont want Dire Maul at launch because it was released 3 months after (US) launch." vs "Gate MC the first week because that is how it is on a private server".  One is arguing for things to be more (US) classic-like and the other is arguing for it to not be.  I think their goal is to make things more like US launch.
---
If it did evolve then I highly doubt it would go the same way as retail. The whole point is it's the opposite of retail really
---
My partner is play a night elf hunter. What is the best complimenting class.
---
I don't want to overlap loot, I don't mind healing sometimes but strongly prefer playing melee. We are going to pvp often and raid casually.
---
I had the same exact monitor and speakers. What are the odds? O_o
---
You can be a shitty hunter that way, but decently played hunters are a bit more involved.
---
I'd consider a healer, particularly priest. In groups mana management is an important role so you'll want to spend as much time as possible not casting. Then when soloing you spend a lot of time on each mob wanding which is pretty passive.
---
Yep still married :)
---
Max reputation, be a big guilds GM for aq40 open event mount, run ZG and strat UD 10-thousand times.
---
This is not one of those things you can decide on. The dropchance is simply too low for you to be able to grind it. 
---
I mean, I find him annoying at times but you need to get over yourself. It's a fucking game lmfao
---
&gt; He’s a poser
---
For advocating the release of a video game?.... How can you pose that?
---
&gt; regurgitates information he finds here or official updates
---
So what? He centralises information on the game in video format. That appeals to come people.
---
&gt; not having really played original but gallivanting as if he had
---
How the fuck do you know? I mean, even if he didn't play Vanilla, who fucking cares?
---
&gt; He contributes nothing to the community
---
His subs would beg to differ
---
People like you are a total cancer to any community. You act very elitist about being an "og player". It's a game you fucking loser lmao. 
---
Yaaaaaaaaarrrrrrgggghhhh.
---
Landlubbers, eh?
---
I'd advice Druid from what I'm hearing. First of all you won't share an armor class with any of your friends. Their mana issues are pretty much a breeze once you get innervate. You'll have an easier time soloing than the other classes if you want to do some on the side.
---
 Obviously only having the one Rez on a 30 minute cooldown is the main downside. But considering you're going to have a Warlock with Soulstone in your group that is a bit less of a hassle. Consider picking up Engineering for those jumper cables!
---
Last thing to add is that Druid is incredibly fun in PvP. Nothing beats kiting that Warrior or seeing the Rogue try to vanish through your Faerie Fire.
---
Happy adventures!
---
T1 druid you mean, certainly has the looks of a druid player.
---
Tip is that you?

We actually started as a cross-guild 20-man raiding group when ZG was released. After working on ZG for weeks we were [finally ready for Hakkar](https://i.imgur.com/BW7B5FF.jpg), and has the next few days dedicated to bringing him down.
---
On our first night of trying everything just went right, an hour later he was dead, and we were left wondering what we were going to spend the rest of the night on. Someone suggested a field trip to The Molten Core, just for funsies, so we ported to Stormwind and Ironforge, and spammed /1 with invitations for any level 60 to come with us and have some fun.
---
We wound up with 8 extra people, and tried to read up on the first few fights on the flight to Blasted Lands. We managed to take the first few trash mobs down with those 28 people, and got a taste for it. A week of recruiting later MC was officially on our raiding list, and the rest is history.
---
You're in for a horrible journey. It's going to cost you a *lot* of gold and time. You're also gonna have to carry each and every mount/pet as an individual item. 
---
You're crazy, but I admire your passion. 
---
Not at all, I even find him annoying. I would never get butthurt about another man making an honest living though. Some sad, sad people in the world. I hope you get your issues sorted dude, I really do.

Gun driven world events would be so fun. Maybe random dragons attacking storm wind or demons taking over the church. 
---
Dynamic events like the end of the original beta would be great to mix things up every now and then.

r/wow is probably one of the dullest gaming subreddit out there. It’s all about looks and nothing about relevant content. Not that it’s their fault. There isn’t much to say about the game right now., but still.
---
I've actually changed my mind on faction, gonna go for Horde.
---
Not sure between Orc or Troll Rogue though. I like both for different reasons. For PvP, the Orc seems nice, but I prefer berserking in other situations since it feels more tangible, plus it doesn't interrupt your levelling flow by making bandaging, eating or potions bad.
---
I prefer how most armour fits on a troll, except for feet and headpieces obviously. I like both combat animations. I prefer Orc stealth but not by much. 
---
Hard to say honestly. 
---
Same! Made my way through the RoC campaign, onto TFT now :)

Druid seems like really a good fit. 
---
 Paladin too but you might be bummed out by their lack of melee abilities. 
---
 Otherwise Rogue and Warrior is never a bad option if you truly like melee. If you're willing to tank with Warrior you'll never have a hard time finding a group.
---
Glad you could make it, Uther.
---
Thanks, I never got to BWL before TBC so wasnt sure what they were saying.
---
Have you tried any of the WoW maps/mods?
---
It’s why I stopped going to the Pokémon subreddit. Every post was some quickly made craft or a picture of a tattoo someone got of their favorite Pokémon.
---
We're open to modifying rules/moderation styles, so send us ModMail with idea! We're not usually big fans of crappy image posts and prefer discussion posts, but a lot of it comes down to how the community updoots things, at least to some extent.
---
This exactly. We have nothing new to discuss as this'll be more or less an identical re-release of a 15 year old game. Every topic of Vanilla WoW has already been discussed to pieces. The only thing we really talk about in this sub is when Blizzard gives us some new info about how the systems of classic are coming along, like the mail, warlock pet summoning, personal loot etc.
---
I'd rather see low effort image posts than "What class are you rolling in classic?" polls.
---
Did this over the holiday season to relive my younger days. Great game to play though years later, definitely replay value.
---

---
I don’t want to fucking talk about what happens in 20000000 years when everyone defeated Naxx. That conversation is so unnecessary and beaten to death, back to life and then to death again.
---
The game isn’t even out, if I see one more person ask when MoP is being released after classic I’m going go apeshit. Nobody has even hit 60, stop talking about what happens in twenty billion years when every raid has been on farm for months. 
---
Holy shit, find something new to talk about.
---
ok... stop dots
---
I'd rather wait till Reforged.
---
He was still fun to tame in a time when the named rares weren't as plentiful as now.

Well; when the game comes out we will actually have something to talk abbot. The circle jerking is a symptom of the lack of substance.

Everytime you try to open a conversation here you get your post removed, i made a post yesterday about dungeons and how they have changed from vanilla, got a lot of conversation right away and a mod decided to remove it in the middle of everything...
---
Yeah, I'll certainly have a threat meter as well as either dps or healing meter on one side. Thinking about it, I think the best part will be the *massive* chat window I can have. It will also be nice for a healer to have full raid frame up and keep a big FoV.

Theres a few subs ive seen do it right, they remove the downvote button. The low effort bullshit fades away quickly while even at the worst if good disscussion isnt upvoted its still there for a little bit and not on page 2 or 3

This post is removed as low-effort (Rule #7). Image posts must be immediately recognizable as related to Classic WoW without need of reading the post's title. Sorry.

---
No GM requests allowed for loot trading IS the compromise. Blizzard's stance is they don't want to pay GMs, under no loot trading they get what they want and so do we.
---
Lmfao oh boy this might be the most wrong thing I've ever read
---
With DM delayed it won't be as bad. Hunters will make a ton of cash farming Mara/selling princess runs to people who want thrash blade. Healers/tanks (and they can do it as dps specs) can always make steady money just doing instances. Locks can farm elites easily. Mages can solo trash other than lashers. Rogues have ppocket.  Everyone has a gold farm and only a couple are really broken.
---
Examples of broken off the top of my head
---
Soloing Tribute Run
---
Soloing Naxx trash which can drop BIS items like Misplaced Servo Arm. 
---
Something rogues can do in Naxx which is just stupid.
---
Soloing ZG trash is probably less of an issue, but I could see them possibly stopping something there.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they fixed an exploit in ZG either with the raptor boss or boss exploits with divine intervention.  I heard that people WERE punished for the raptor one (and I remember leaving pugs that did it because I didn't want to lose my account from gearing my alt) but not for the Alliance one (I played Horde).  It was probably just too late at that point because so much gear had been gotten from it when Blizzard found out.
---
I remember waaay back I played a custom map in wc3 that was called world of Warcraft. It played out similar ,you level a character killing mobs and there are mobs that spawned that ran the middle kinda like LoL.this reminds me, I might try some single player custom maps cheers op
---
More memes pls.
---
Raids were also made somewhat harder due to having to coordinate 40 people, get them geared, and keep them happy so they dont leave.  Drama and turnover in 40-person raiding makes progression challenging sometime even if the mechanics themselves are easy.
---

---
Looks like the Warsong Gulch entrance to me.

only because blizz banned half the guilds who beat him
---
That's just the raid leader being a dick which has always been a problem and never something support has intervened in 
---
My myspace page ruled though
---
I don't believe that's the *only* thing they want. They want to help people too who fucks up and missloots. It's going to happen - it always does.
---
Let the people decide with upvotes and downvotes
---
Nah
---
This entire city must be purged
---
I mean, that's literally the point of my post? There isn't anything more interesting atm than the map stuff, that's why they're getting upvoted..
---
I cant speak for everyone but when Classic releases I have 0 interest in returning to this sub, all info is well known, nothing new will ever be added. This is like a long term digital version of a midnight release for me, im here to share in the excitement but I doubt ill be back once I can play. Hell I dont even think I started getting on r/wow until after I unsubbed.
---
I am on the same boat. Always play warrior in other games too but I don't have much time and leaning towards mage.
---
I prefer Druid tanks for 5 mans. They are tankier and seem to be more idiot-proof.
---
Well yesterday i wanted to talk about all the dungeons that were changed from vanilla, because i totally forgot that 90% of them are not even the same anymore, got post removed... i tried searching for a similiar post and couldnt find one...
---
Up to the top you go :D 
---
Oh sorry, I mean it’s custom to give two weeks before leaving a job, which seems like clearly the way to go here...
---

---
The Rake, my other favorite!  I loved camping and taming rares.  I would leave off leveling just to hang in their spawn locations.  People laugh but it was so relaxing.

Well mods are removing legit conversations too, like this one that got removed by me yesterday:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0ddu8/wich\_of\_the\_vanilla\_dungeons\_have\_been\_revamped/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0ddu8/wich_of_the_vanilla_dungeons_have_been_revamped/)  
---
I mean its not a super duper crazy topic, i just suddenly realized alot of vanilla dungeons were revamped at some point and wanted to discuss in details wich dungeons were changed etc, it got removed even tho it started a conversation, because apparently its not vanilla related content....
---
GMs are most likely the one part of vanilla they will never bring back
---
Me too
---
This isn't necessarily true. A lot of guilds will accommodate people who are making a serious push to 13 or 14. Having a Grand Marshal or High Warlord in the guild is good publicity. 
---
Well, being a melee means you will overlap some gear. Below I'll write out my thoughts on different classes.
---
**ROGUE** is a nice fit because in PvP you can both peel quite well for each other (most importantly, the rogue can peel for the hunter). Furthermore the stuns allows for easy Aimed Shots, thus being able to save trap for full CC instead of just a way to get off one Aimed Shot.
---
**WARRIOR** is actually also a nice fit once *geared.* The thing that makes this work is it makes it hard for enemies to prioritize. If they ignore the warrior he is free to just reck them, but if they ignore the hunter he can free cast. It is not as strong as other combos, but personally I'd say it's really fun to play this duo.
---
**DRUID** is amazing since you can get into a group / guild as a healer. Now, for the PvP play you will most likely not be pure melee, but rather a combinations of some off heals, spells (like roots and dmg spells), bear when getting focused and cat for some melee dps. A real hybrid that doesn't feel much like melee, but it will certainly be strong with a hunter.
---
So from above I'd say all three works, pick what you prefer. As a last note, if you should consider casters both warlock and mage is generally strong and will work with a hunter, but mage takes the cake. If the enemy *ever* focus the hunter, this means the mage is free to cast frostbolts, essentially perma-slowing the enemy, allowing you to get away. If they focus the mage he got his frost nova and blink to get away and the hunter is now free to cast without interrupts.
---
You have to stock that sweet sweet oil of anticipation. Don’t give in and use your resources!!
---
Considering I have more free time than you and I am still debating whether or not I can manage two. Yeah.
---
Okay, so I think I've finally settled on priest. 
---
If I'm horde, is Troll or Undead better for PvE? 
---
Secondly, professions. It looks like the play is herb/skinning till 60, drop skinning, save up all the necessary cloth stacks to be able to hit 300 tailoring at level 60, craft the epic vest thing, drop tailoring, and start leveling up alchemy. Is that pretty much the way to go? 
---
Yes those are still problems, should we just not complain about them anymore because they did the content plan right? This is what got us this plan, complaining, or rather constructive criticism :)
---
This is nice but there are a lot of orange buildings you could have used. You're using premium right?
---
Not sure what I want to play in Classic for PVP and a bit of World PVP on the side. I have settled on caster but not sure between Undead Mage or Orc Lock. I don't plan on raiding at all just PVP. What would the pros and cons be for each class in terms of PVP. Mage does sound fun but is it too squishy? and with a Lock not sure if I want to manage a pet all the time. Any help would be great. thanks
---
As with any subreddit, the main one becomes all about the art and video which forces the actual discussion content to migrate to a newer one with a lot less traffic.
---
See r/dnd , r/Dota2 , r/Overwatch and about a million others.
---
Nope, free. Literally says on the title haha.
---
Yeah, that actually sounds like an interesting post - a lot of people don't know how the dungeons were before being revamped, like Cookie not being one of the main bosses in Deadmines, etc. 
---
Why on earth did that post get removed?
---
&gt;keep in mind my appeal is BGs
---
Druid for sure man, druid in WSG is SOOOOO fun, highlight of my vanilla career tbh. 
---
See you get it this other guy is an idiot lol
---
Rhapsody while running through Dun Morogh. 
---
&gt;if we queue together we may end up in separate groups in the BG raid 
---
You can que together even in classic from what I recall.
---
For PvP specifically the Orc racial is amazing, arguably the best in the game. But Berserking is a lot more fun. Luckily you have quite a while to decide. I'd consider which race fantasy fits you the most and if you want to stick out or not. Troll Rogue is probably going to be a bit more rare than Orc

---
Thanks to wveryone for responses. Im actually aware of the time invest and totaly fine with it. I know about the rep grind. My main concern is to miss something becaus it changed over the years. Like the chicken minipet from the farm near stormwind is ally only in classic, right? Is the ungoro raptor horde only and the wintersaber ally only in classic? Wich minipets can a classic engeenier craft and wich of them is binded or able to sale? Wich minipets are able to get from classic versions of events like childsweek or darkmoon faire?
---
He blew EVERYTHING in the guild bank to get us here, that man, deserves....some RESPECT!

It's beautiful
---
I want VR WoW just to fly and explore. Flying through Val’Sharah or Nazmir in VR would be absolutely breathtaking.
---
Vashj’ir would probably give me an anxiety attack though.
---
Honestly this is the pickiest reddit I've ever seen. People just keep complaining. Youtubers aren't allowed to link their content, polls are a waste of time, "not another [] post", "this has been discussed to death", ect.
---
It's going to be all maps from now on and you're going to like it!
---
They're extremely chill levelling and exploring after level 10.
---
I am hardcore and just play wotlk soundtrack over it
---
I really hope there's less raid drama in classic than there was in Vanilla...
---
&gt;I love healing with HOTS
---
The problem with HoTs in vanilla is reju overwrite from different druids and regrowth sucks. It might see some use on pservers, but that's mainly because it double dips healing power, on Classic it will almost certainly not do that, thus being quite a lot weaker.
---
&gt; the lack of mobility in fights seems unappealing to me in pvp.
---
Well, the lack of mobility is counteracted by being able to survive a lot better. I understand you, because I prefer the mobility of a druid, but I have to say, when I played a holy paladin in TBC I was surprised of how little I missed my mobility, it was simply a different experience - so I'd say, at least don't rule it out without looking more into it.
---
Thanks! Found the original vanilla one in google and then tried to do it looking from the second screen
---
Mage is squishy for sure but you can do a lot with little gear. You've got incredible escape with blink and arguably the best kiting tools in the game. 
---
Warlock is a lot more durable but really requires some good gear until you can really start to do things. Pet management is quite easy and I wouldn't let that get in the way of picking a class.
---
If you like burst go Mage. If you like slowly wearing your opponents down while cackling madly as they sit through your third CC go warlock.
---
I'm most likely going to put Unbreakable and Maydie videos on repeat.
---
*Every* spell must be on the hotbar!
---
Hi, the only reason I didn’t is simply because my timings could fit into both. But for clarity I’m EU!
---
Red: I think it will take years. 
---
1. Only active with master looter activated
---
2. Make it so that an item can only be traded a single time
---
3. Make it so that every person eligible is notified that an item has changed hands. Which player traded it to whom, when the item dropped and when it was traded. Normally, an item would only retain a special tag in the database for 30 minutes. Extending for up to 3 days if it is traded, allowing players affected to extend it and possibly report it to a Game Master. The goal being to catch would be unfair handling of loot, without filling up 20-30% of the ticket inbox with loot related incidents.  
---
If the system is implemented intelligently, you can have the majority of complaints be legitimate complaints, while still having very few complaints. Implement some sort of threshold, where a single player complaining out of the 40 players eligible for the item does not trigger a GM response.  
---
The exact item should play a role as well. Where items such as Drake Fang Talisman and Neltharion's tear requiring significantly fewer reports before coming under scrutiny. Compared to seal of the Archmagus. Legendary items being the most affected.
---
If possible, make it so that the raid leader has to type out the loot rules which will display upon joining the raid, entering instances and engaging world bosses. If the master looter is not the raid leader, he/she would have to accept. Attach the rules to all item drops for the period it is eligible for trade.
---
Back in the day: Orgy, Stati X, Dope, Rob Zombie, Slipknot, Bleeding Through, and these hour long techno mixes I’d download from lime wire.
---
When the game launches:  Cowboy bebop soundtrack, jamiroquai, Static X and Gorillaz with maybe a 90’s alternative playlist from Spotify sprinkled in. 
---
I’d only listen to music while farming or pug dungeons/pvp, raids I would listen to vent and that’ll probably be the case going forward.
---
Well Undead has devouring plague as a class racial and can break fear which is used a lot in classic if you like doing pvp on the side a lot or want to play shadow pick them. Otherwise Troll isn't bad for progression pve side of things.
---
We dont know yet if you can camp out but you can always remove all gear and die and run back to entrance that way.
---
We've had more warlock applicants than any other class in my guild so far. 
---
I get what you're saying to a point and I would agree if he was harmless to the community, but he is not. 
---
Emphasis on ***was***. 
---
I've recently tried playing pug BGs both as rogue and warlock on a a private server so I'll can give you some insight. No idea on premades though.
---
Rogue is more optimal for smaller scale fights, 1v1s etc (that's why the defense role in premades I suppose). The element of suprise which is a big advantage for rogue wpvp is usually missing in BGs, so most of your enemies are prepared for your opener. Also, rogue is kinda CD dependant, so in many cases you won't have the necessary CDs to win smaller scale fights. As for 'big' fights, rogues are terrible (at least on a private server BGs where players and specs are optimized for pvp): in melee range warriors/ret pallys/enha shamans/other rogs are stunning you or oneshotting you. From ranged, literally everything is destroying you if you do not have a dedicated healer. I usually do not bother to open in big fights, only when the fight is already decided in favor of my side and I can finish off low hp enemies. In any other case, I would be the first to die in big fights instantly after opener.
---
Warlocks seem a lot better  in BGs. People say SL is not optimal for BGs but I had so much fun tanking damage and controlling the battlefield (cs, tongues, fear, dots, smallers burst when needed etc.). SL is usually the last one standing (enemies ignore you after a certain point) which I find a lot more fun then dying first as a rogue. If you play a more glasscanon spec (sm/ruin or deep destro) then you stay behind with the friendly mages and hunters for ranged dps spam. However, in such case melees sticking on you and gibbing you down could be frustrating (but if they dont make it to you, then you are literally blowing shit up). I would say play rogue if you want to engage in smaller scale fights/skirmishes and want to play as a melee in general. Play warlock of you want to participate in the big fights dot/control/dps the enemy as a ranged caster.
---
I hope this helps!
---
Troll or Undead Mage... I'm having a difficult time deciding. Will PvP and PvE but maybe slightly more interested in PvP (still waiting to see what they announce to gauge my interest)
---
BoP should just be BoP.
---
It's be hard to enforce.
---
Linkin Park, Disturbed, Soil, Hoobastank etc.
---
I don't agree with either of those things. 45 is way, way too high. Leveling takes time in classic, the pack will spread out long before then.
---
Art? This is from a fairly cheap map making tool that literally anyone can get online
---
Wish I could do that at work ha, pretty sure we're not allowed to change backgrounds. Slightly bothering the logo is cut in half. Maybe there's a version with he logo on the corners?
---
I know a great soundtrack. It's called the Classic WoW OST
---
Yea your right I never raided vanilla, i definitely don't have a full t2+ hunter.
---
You must have never been master looter. If you misclick then click accept on the misclick your a moron. If someone ever told you they fucked up a masterloot they were lieing. The gear goes where its supposed to. 
---
NO LOOT TRADING,  NO SWAPS, NO EXCEPTIONS. 
---
This is Lil Timmy’s Peashooter for me.
---
Was a huge upgrade for my poor dwarf hunter - warrior needed it(!!). Whole group in the WTF mode. I even linked my shitty green ranged into chat. 
---
He never spoke a word and left the dungeon once finished.
---
Guess what I found freshly added on the AH straight after? Q_Q
---
Then forgot you've got it because you've been condition into running everywhere for 40 levels
---
Yes. Leveled 4 60s horde side... raided every week horde side...
---
I just wanna be a gnome 
---
Anyone who doesn’t listen to in game music whilst they play isn’t truly playing the game 
---
They worked in vanilla, it was actually much more lucrative early in vanilla because the 5 instance per hour cap wasn't added until after Dire Maul launched.  As a mage I would zone into the back door of DM:E, kill and loot the lasher pack there and zone out to reset.  You could do that about 35-45 times an hour if you were quick.
---
Alternative title: "Screenshot from WC3"
---
Many of the best relationships I've made in the game started before lvl 20. That time is essential for socializing and creating the feeling of a community.
---
Hey everyone, I’m sorry to bother you all, I’d just love some advice between two classes I’m torn between, warlock and hunter. The reason I’m interested in these classes is because I plan on playing casually and appreciate the idea of an easy/fun levelling experience with little to no downtime. My end game goals are to PUG BG’s and possibly raids.
---
I initially thought I’d love hunter, I played rogue in late vanilla/early TBC onward, so the thought of a ranged physical DPS really appealed to me. I also liked the thought of being pretty strong in PvP and able to farm gold easily for alts/professions.
---
I imagined warlock for their group utility, pets, free mount, and PvP strength.
---
Thing is I tried both on a pserver recently and I have to ask, is the ease of levelling unlocked with the hunters pet?? Because the levelling experience has been actually a bit of a tough slog (not level 10 yet) versus the lock who I literally am melting mobs, groups at a time. The lock has occasionally downtime but not often thanks to lifetap. 
---
I guess my questions are does this downtime for locks become more significant over time? 
---
Do hunters essentially become more or less the same once they get their pet? 
---
Thanks all in advance for any advice :)
---
There's no Un'goro raptor in Vanilla
---
Nope, the GM's working to support players on retail are the ones that will support players on classic. So they will be way too busy to do these kind of things.
---
You have my axe!
---
Hey, I may be stating the obvious but the other dude was preaching to the choir.
---
How did this work - I mean at what time of the encounter did the lava erupt?
---
Private servers kill Rag before the first submerge so I have no recent memory of the lava
---
Yeah don't run out of things to talk about and resort to talking about other games and subreddits
---
Oh wait
---
Off topic, but I have been thinking how I would fix reddit, but the changes are so major it will never happen. I think this whole karma system should be canned, make all upvote/downvote numbers hidden (they can do the same algorithms in the background). In general, force people to actually form an opinion instead of jumping on a bandwagon.
---
in-game music + eye of the tiger, push it to the limit, etc when raiding or pvping
---
The only thing that makes sense to me is that master-looted items could be returned to the boss corpse and then redistributed in case of a master looting mistake. 
---
I'm gonna play the shit out of WoW. Mostly weekends though. it's going to be great.
---
Whether it's allowed or not it's going to happen. Buying gold in classic will also be very prevalent. I'm not in favor of it, but I suspect the wow token to rear its ugly head up at some point in classics lifetime. 
---
This is honestly a good example of why we got automated stuff.. yes it was cool but the GM could have been working to resolve an actual issue during that time
---
He had that side to him, sure, but he was also *The Warchief.*  In Cata he literally ran off to go take care of the planet or something (I didn't play too far into Cata).
---
I agree with you on the ideal server size, but don't see the same problem with sharding as you do. I understand it's not perfect, but I don't see any better option if Blizz does it fairly and exactly how they said at Blizzcon - just for the launch and only if needed. You won't be leveling in your own world, it's not instancing - there'll still be plenty of wild druid moonfires flying about, because I presume the cap for shards to still be quite substantial. And these druids will still be on your server when you're 20+ and sharding is long forgotten, so you can learn to love them in SM just as planned.
---
My experience with both is that they are just ok until level 10, but upon getting a tanky pet/voidwalker the game becomes a breeze.  Send pet, attack attack, next mob.
---
Warlock especially with the dots.  Let VW grab aggro, dot the mob, send VW to another mob, shadowbolt first mob, dies, repeat.
---
So given you're posting in this thread, you've clearly seen it. How is this not a violation of rule 1? Why let shitstirring posts like this through? 
---
Idk, probably only Blizzard could ever know exact what pre-nerf Ragnaros was like. It's not really about turning MC into some kind cutting edge progression, though - it's just about experiencing the game as it was in a way that only Blizzard can deliver
---
I meant what are the lava eruptions like?  They're still occurring post nerf according to that note - it's just playing on a pvt server that kills Rag pre submerge I never see spawns or any eruptions.
---
Whilst I remember the spawns from my retail time I don't remember any eruptions.
---
I once opened a ticket to try and ask a GM about their job for a paper in a class in college. They humored me and answered all my questions. It was awesome. I wish I still had the transcript.
---
Very. But I'm sure many of us want classic to be a microcosm. I would be perfectly fine with a ban from classic servers for a scheme like that. 
---
Haven't though about that, true. But for that you need a lot of bag space ^^
---
I typically play with something else on a second monitor, like a twitch stream or some other sort of video. I don't really like background music unless it's really well done and actually adds something to a game for example. In game WoW music is great the first time you enter a zone or so, but after that it gets old very fast. 
---
Back in the day I had music on almost non-stop every day. But nowadays I only put on music when I can actually listen to it properly, don't like just having it in the background. 
---
I dont think wow token will ever be added, but I think the gold transfering would allow it to influence our servers. I'd like for blizzard to come out and say it would be a ban from classic servers.
---
Sleep - Dope Smoker

70s folk rock vibes *very well* with the long leveling journey:
---
Jim Croce
---
Cat Stevens
---
Nick Drake
---
Forget the Un'goro raptor (added in ToC patch...) and if ally be ready to grind like hell for the wintersaber. 
---
It takes A LOT of time since there's just 3 quests (2 if below honored, 1 if below 1500/3000 neutral) giving 50-75 rep each turn-in (75 for the group quest requiring honored, 50 for the other two).
---
I reckon undead is the best choice in your situation. 
---
Mage isn't that squishy. Rogues ignore you unless you're doing AoE farming. I'd go for them out of those. 
---
i'll tell ya, i'm really good at the starting zones xD
---
We go back and forth on this, and we're in the discussion of adding another mod or two (potentially) to get more around the clock coverage, but we have an internal policy of generally avoiding removal of a post that has numerous replies by the time we've seen the post, even if it doesn't necessarily fit into the ruleset. If it's explicitly breaking the rules, it'll get removed either way, but something borderline (I'd say this is borderline in a sense, but I can see how you could argue against that) with a lot of replies will be left in some instances - upvotes don't influence it, but discussion can, to be clear.
---
very low droprates; great grind quests to knock off a level
---
Troll IMHO. Berserking is a decent little ability to use in PVE but outside that there isn't much between the two.
---
If you really wanna go alchemy though, undead might be for your cuz they have this cool apothecary vibe. 
---
Casting animations for both are decent.  Both kinda do the "kamehameha" style animation when they are casting an attack spell.  Troll slightly more so than undead.
---
Undead has a smaller model frame than troll.
---
Troll dance is capoeira style.  Undead dance is metal/rock.
---
Trolls don't wear shoes.  Undead do.
---
Dad-a-chum? Dum-a-chum? Ded-a-chek? Did-a-chick?
---
There's plenty to talk about but people are burned out on all of it and just want to play
---
Again, this is stupid.
---
Sharding does not mean you'll be in a single player game, there will be plenty of people to interact with, and they'll be people on YOUR server ONLY.
---
Jesus christ dude, it's only for launch so people get to actually play the game for the first few weeks. what is wrong with you people.
---
It's obvious that Blizz doesn't want to handle these tickets and has reduced CS staff which reinforces their position of loot trading.  So my question to you is this.  Are you going to refuse to play Classic because of loot trading?  I'm not.  I'll do what I can to prevent these extreme examples that you give.  Friends and a guild of people you have spent time with and trust.  Could it happen...sure...can you be preventative about it...yes.  If it happens it happens.  Try again.  In the end it's just a game, not my real life.
---
In retail vanilla I was in a guild and we were like a huge family.  We did alot of high end dungeons and raids and there were a few times we had to put in a GM ticket for an item because it was given to the wrong person.  Not once did anyone ever ninja loot anything because I'd like to think we were all good people.
---
Sorry if you had bad times with PUG groups.  I was always in a guild group in BRD myself, and we were all working to gear each other up for raiding, so this was never an issue.  
---
It's like when a higher level player keeps ganking you and camping you.  If you go to a GM they will simply tell you to call some friends to help you, or hearth and change zones or log out for a while and come back later.  In the end it's up to you to choose what position you put yourself in.  
---
Morning everyone!  I am getting excited about the opportunity to experience WoW in its classic form.  I started playing around WoTLC, predominately as a Warrior and Death Knight.  I only played a couple years, but loved the game for its social aspects.  Since then, I have played a few other MMORPGs regularly, but nothing extreme.  I am leaning towards playing as a Warrior since I prefer to tank.  Additionally, I will be Horde.  My questions are the following:  
---
How difficult will it be to get accustomed to Classic tanking mechanisms for someone who never really played the game?
---
Is there any tangible preference to any race for a warrior tank in Classic? (I was planning on being an Orc)
---
Thanks everyone, and happy WoWing!
---
Dude lmfao I saw a guy comment on one recently saying “can we just fast forward to a year from now when you’ve done all of Azeroth and we can buy the whole map for thousands of dollars??”
---
Sad!!!
---
While i agree with most of your points i will respectfully disagree, it started with WOTLK.
---
You do realise people raided for 12 hours straight and was tired as fuck? Yes, there were mistakes. In EVERY GUILD.
---
What a great zone. Redridge always did a great job of feeling enormous to me. 
---
Maybe we can get a separate sub reddit för fan art? 
---
I guess I was quite into metal back then,  
---
Disturbed, SoAD, Linkin Park, Perfect Circle, Blind Guardian, Breaking Benjamin, Charon, Korn, Earshot, Godsmack, Guano Apes, Iced Earth, In Flames, Megadeth, Nightwish, Seether, Tool and ofc Rammstein!  
---
Funny thing, as you say, 14-15 years later, I'm probably gonna be listening to the same stuff again when I dive into ClassicWoW. Haven't really been exploring new music much after highschool.  
---
Last year, I had some free time so I came up with this playlist,  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBkqfww93bs&amp;list=PLrWZro2T3BNj-v-3iRt9yaGLUtBwUNb5Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBkqfww93bs&amp;list=PLrWZro2T3BNj-v-3iRt9yaGLUtBwUNb5Z) , give it a spin if you like!
---
as soon as you get an imp at level 4 you can do triangle kiting as well,
---
make your imp pull aggro first with fireball, cast corruption, then cast immolate, finish with 1 shadowbolt which will make the mob run for you while you're a few metres away from your imp; the time it takes for the mob to travel gives your imp another free fireball and you finish the mob with your melee weapon and dots. 
---
summoning an imp doesn't cost that much money and no shard, along with life tap you pretty much don't have to drink 
---
Took us, 26 people, to bring this beast down. Our accomplishment was welcomed by the local people, as you can see from the chat.
---
I actually reckon Paladin, they have a simple enough toolkit with an instant heal, a quick heal and a slow heal so I don't think mobility is a big issue, at least Priest has the same issues too. As for buffs, at higher levels you get the 15 minute version which should last you well.
---
Main issue with them IMHO is the boring levelling, but if you're going with friends I don't see why you'd have issues. 
---
Nah I like it like that lol. Feels larger more expansive 
---
Haha, dammit, all I can think of now is about that girl that was trying to pay for her flying mount in tbc with.... Services in lieu of gold.    Was that a true story or urban legend.   Off topic I know, bit the high mind works in weird ways.
---
Like those giant flame eruptions to the right in this [video](https://youtu.be/PTEojnxf0fE?t=100).
---
I don't see any DEAD END signs.
---
12 weeks?? You believe it'll drop in June? Didnt we already get confirmation that it'll drop when that guy goes on family vacation? Wasn't that like... Sept. or something?
---
I don't like to hate on Blizzard, I think they're doing a great job with the "GMing" in retail. It's efficient and works well, fast and you get the support you want. 
---
I just missed the good old days when you could chat with a GM for 2 hours because they had nothing to do at night (EU). Doing random and stupid stuff.
---
25% racial + 5% base. I did the math for you.
---
Really, what do they say about
---
How much was the damage reduced?
---
That could also bone a reserve run if they've used their expertise to get the scrubs through, and then they collectively renege on the agreement to screw the leader who helped them.
---
Warcraft 2 OST  
---
Mainly when u enter a big city, u ll have goosebumps
---
I briefly looked for a mini-pet guide as I love collecting those as well, but didn't find anything (I didn't look too hard though).  I can tell you a few off the top of my head:
---
Red Whelpling - From the Red Whelps in the Wetlands
---
Green Whelpling - From the Green Whelps in the Swamp of Sorrows
---
Dark Whelpling - From the Dark Whelps in the Searing/Scalding Whelps in the Badlands or Dustwallow Marsh
---
Disgusting Oozeling - From just about any ooze that's level 50+
---
Hyacinth Macaw - From Bloodsail enemies in the Deadmines
---
That's all I can think of for now.  Feel free to add any if you know of any others.  
---
&gt;Guilds may bring 1 shadow priest but that will be it. 
---
I can't emphasize this enough u/weedleqt .  Most guilds will only need ONE and ONLY ONE shadow priest, and usually that's after most of you (the priest and the Warlocks) are in minimum Tier 1 sets.  Prior to MC gear, most warlocks just don't have the damage output to justify the shadow priest.
---
That being said, unless you're in a min-max guild you should hopefully be able to find a spot.  Just be aware that everyone wants to be the shadow priest so unless you get into the guild early, provide some service to the guild (like guild alchemist for example), or ....be an officer.  That's a sure fire way to guarantee you get to be shadow priest lol.  Just make sure you carry your weight.  Noone wants a...well...let's be real: "meme spec" shadow priest in a raid that doesn't even play at 100%.
---
You know the DR resets right?
---
So the chicken isn't necessarily ally only. You just have to work harder. The 'special chicken feed' you need is ally only on a merchant, but you could use the neutral auction house to acquire it. Then you just /chicken at the chickens and quest will eventually pop. You use your item acquired from Neutral AH and Bam, chicken pet
---
yeah definitely don't see those on a pvt server
---
But I was told private servers are hyper super accurate, in fact they're even harder than live!!!1!
---
Except they will be labeled "bug" or some other category. Keep changing your answer it's still bad for blizzard. Having no solution is the opposite of good customer service and blizzard isn't going to take that big of a massive step back. Loot sharing is coming, it's absolutely not a big deal and the more you cry the more it looks like this community is all still 12 somehow even though everyone was 12 when the game came out. Btw you wont be 12 so keep crying you fucking moron.
---
Then why fix what isn’t broken?
---
but I was 12 when this game came out and so I need to act like a 12 year old child and cry because ITS DIFFERENT from when I played when I actually 12. How can I enjoy the game if its even 0.000000000001% different in a completely nonimpactful way? This is too much stress for 12 year old me mental breakdown into tears in 3...2...1...
---
Thanks, that makes sense and seems to be a consistent philosophy among mods but I figured I'd ask in this case since I saw you here.
---
Its honestly a lot easier just to take the loot trading mechanic out completely. It would benefit Blizzard by not being hassled by players wanting help. It would benefit the players by not encouraging loot ransom or loot gangs. 
---
Just take it out. Make BoP items soulbound as they should be.
---
In the long run, a harsh, unforgiving loot system is the most playable for everyone. 
---
How is he a danger to the community then?
---
There is that chicken pet from westfall.
---
bite is more dmg per focus but has a cooldown, claw just gets spammed untill you have no focus left. Biggest dps would probably be bite into claw spam
---
I like this question and would also like to know about groups in bgs 
---
Does the group get assigned based on randomness or is it people who party will be grouped together? 
---
This will be useful for healers too. 
---
I won’t engage you any more on this as it’s a lost cause, but I gave an example in my OP. 
---
What do I do if I don't care one way or the other?
---
In vanilla I remember having a playlist for pvp of duality, vermillion  by slipknot and some SOAD. Now I just rock whatever music I feel like for grinding and disc for raids/pvp. I think for leveling I'd do 90%igm and occasionally whatever new album I'm interested in tbqh.
---
You can buy Macaw's from the bird vendor in Booty bay.
---
&gt;Here are a few examples that made it into patch notes, and there's many more undocumented nerfs
---
The problem is that not even Blizzard knows about these changes.
---
&gt;Patch 1.12 was chosen because it was the earliest existing set of complete data Blizzard had
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-06-how-world-of-warcraft-classics-patch-content-will-roll-out-and-more
---
I've been deliberating over this the last few months and I'm torn between a few classes. This is what I know so far:
---
**I DON'T want to play:**
---
* Rogue - I don't like the playstyle.  'Nuff said.
---
* Hunter - I like the class fantasy, and I find the "pet collecting" aspect of hunters enjoyable.  I don't like the primarily ranged combat or kiting aspect of hunters though.  Overall the class could be "on the fence" but it just seems like they also don't scale very well in vanilla, not to mention I'm biased from retail when they were called "huntards" and were an over-represented class.
---
**I'm on the fence for:**
---
* Mage - I played one to level 40 before, but never got much further.  I like the burst nature, plus the AoE available.  I enjoy the arcane and frost specs.  I like that they are always wanted for group utility, but dislike the super competitive nature of the gear they share (as many as 4 classes can compete for priest gear - shaman/paladin, warlock, mage).
---
* Warrior - I enjoy tanking in other MMO's, but my only experience tanking in WoW was during TBC with a Blood Elf paladin.  I've never gotten the hang of playing a warrior in wow, but I could potentially see myself playing this as an alt, just not sure it's "main" material.
---
* Paladin - If Blood Elves existed I'd roll this in a heart beat, otherwise I'm primarily a Horde player, so this is more or less a non-option unless some real old school friends message me out of the blue and say they are rolling an alliance guild...
---
**I'm leaning towards:**
---
* Shaman - My old main.  I played all specs, and raided through all tiers except Naxx with a shaman.  Enjoy the class fantasy immensely, along with the hybrid versatility.  My fallback/go-to option.
---
* Warlock - Never played this much back in the day but I enjoy the class fantasy of a warlock "on the edge" of morality so to speak.  I think I preferred TBC warlocks more, but I could find myself enjoying this class in pvp since they have a high skill cap and lots of utility spells.
---
* Druid - A class I actually wouldn't mind healing if it were TBC, I did level a druid to 70 during TBC but that's a whole other era where all 3 specs were viable.  As it stands, healing is "mediocre" and while I enjoy the fantasy, I actually despise playing as feral.  I enjoyed balance/resto more.
---
* Priest - I enjoy all 3 specs equally.  Probably my #3 choice overall behind Shaman or Warlock if I had to give myself personal rankings.
---
I appreciate any feedback!
---
So for one fight out of what 50+ raid bosses in the game it might be necessary to be crit capped, good one.
---
How will you farm gold on a mage at launch?
---
Why would you care when it still attacks faster?
---
what exactly do you mean by "all info is well known"?
---
Ill absolutely come back here regularly to check top/weekly's and probably for the content releases and bluepost discussions.
---
If you find a tailor buddy to convert your cloth into bolts maybe. But farming everything to silk is super quick. The it slows down a bit but still shouldn’t take too long 0-300 with no prep. 
---
Oh like the official Wow Forums? ##/s
---
You would have to have over +7% hit for that to even matter
---
With Mage, I would say just pick what race you personally like best.
---
WOTF is great, cannibalize isn't all that important with a mage.  Troll has advantages in PVE, but overall, I'd pick what aesthetics you like.
---
UD imo.
---
The majority of the gold from dme/n come from vendors and the majority of the gold from tribute runs is brilliant shards and pots. That is unless if you farm it without enchanting which is a pretty big gold loss. Problem is that tribute is just fucking retarded high gold per hour.
---
Yep, this is one area I really wish they would walk away from their "the database is sacrosanct" stance. 1.12 was a world where nobody cared that early content had been nerfed because there was tons to do and TBC was right around the corner. Now we're looking at redoing the whole progression with 1.12 talents and mechanics. It seems like with the recent blue post on content phases Blizz is on board with working to stretch the content out, but in order to do that the content needs to actually be challenging. MC and BWL you have to progress through will last far longer than MC and BWL you face roll on release. Rather than strict values, I wish they'd actually do some play testing and tweak MC and BWL to be a good game.
---
Pretty much. Elemental fire will be expensive for T1 and T2. Elemental earth will be expensive for aq and naxx. Grave moss and fadeleaf will jump in price for naxx as well as elemental waters. Theres a few other consumes that get released later that will cause a reagent to jump in price like volatile rum and firebloom for goblin rocket fuel&gt;chimera chops and whatever is needed for the zg rep consumes
---
Why would they do that?
---
As someone who has farmed literally thousands of gold (probably above 10k actually) inside dungeons, I really hope that blizzard nerfs all of it. The game is not meant for you to sit inside a dungeon by yourself and exploiting lack of mob density or aoeing squishy mobs. You should venture out in the world and kill or gather stuff there.
---
Hopefully they will make goldmaking methods in dungeons so bad that they are a bit of a last resort if you can't farm in the world. 
---
This sounds complicated, so it's kind of unuseful. The Loot Trading is a good solution to misplaced loot, that's it. It works well and I'm quite sure Blizzard is thinking about the possibility to "steal" loot and giving it to a friend.
---
All I wish people would do, would be to actually wait to see how it works. If it doesn't, raise concern and Blizzard will fix it.
---
I agree with Troll being more rare.  I think Orc Rogue is the way to go.  
---
I was a Human Rogue main in vanilla, and it was so god damn annoying facing Orc's, especially Orc Rogues.  that 25% stun resist feels more like 90% when you're facing one. 
---
I never thought twice about attacking a Troll though. 
---
You're wrong. They have the old data, that's how they are restoring the original loot tables.
---
Make rolling need on bops instantly soulbound the item the same way it already works with boes.
---
This compromise deviates the least from Blizzard's current approach and is likely the most cost effective way for them to solve our grievance. The code to do it is basically just sitting there waiting to be frankensteined together.
---
I always have to listen to Angels and Airwaves when I play WoW. Idk why
---
I remember playing on a certain server that delayed MC by a month.
---
Absolutely the worst fucking thing they could've done. 
---
Not sure if you played WoW in vanilla and TBC, but they only did this when there was nothing to do. Usually at nights or late evenings when people went to bed.
---
You say that like Carrot on A Stick isn't the best trinket in Vanilla...
---
If my group of friends that will be playing go Horde, I'll be playing a Druid.  I'm well aware that my life at 60 will be healing and I'm looking forward to that, but while leveling I want to be feral and tank instances.  I know it's possible, I did some odd tanking as Shaman back in vanilla WoW (couldn't recommend it) and bear form druid has proper tanking skills and basic mitigation.  Do you think people will be accepting of it though?  
---
The main reason I don't just go Resto is a friend wants to play Priest and heal it up so we'd have a healer for 5 mans.
---
I managed to get one of every class (the classes that matter, at least--for the horde!) To Max level every expac but bfa. I don't foresee leveling any more toons in that mess of an expac. I'll probably (eventually) get one of everything to 60. My playstyle in classic was always to level until I ran out of rested (or started getting camped--that was a thing as horde on the heavily alliance weighted Sargeras), then relog to another toon. One week after my first 60, I got my next 4 within days of each other. 
---
Happy to hear to some news about classic wow. This make me happy for summer. 
---
We already know how it will work, you just described the problem in your post. There's no hypotheticals here. There's a choice between making people deal with missclick fucksups that are 100% transparent, or the problem of loot collusion which is 100% undetectable. The problem is Blizz is making the wrong choice in the tradeoff.
---
Just a few question that might help you decide.  What are you looking for in Classic?  To raid? to pvp? casual? hardcore?  Reading you seem to like hybrid play style.  Looking to relive the old days or to make new experience? 
---
They have all data for 1.12, but they don't have enough data for recreating patch progression. Proper version control software wasn't a common thing back then.
---
Wow Classic is about re-living the old lol, same as when we have LAN-parties and only play AoE, WC2, HoM&amp;M 3 etc. It's the good old days relived.
---
And they wanted to make Vanilla as authentic as possible, having the development team spend their downtime playing around as GMs would be part of the vanilla experience! :)
---
Excellent post!
---
I mean, im 'only' 29 now and i still love the technological advancements.  I grew up playing Oregon Trail and Ski Free on CRTs.  Not going back to that, thanks.
---
Isnt it missing a serpent family? the sneks with ranged poison debuff and bite? [https://www.wowhead.com/pet=35/serpent](https://www.wowhead.com/pet=35/serpent)
---
What server is this?
---
No thanks.  I play on an 80" TV from my couch with home theater surround system.
---
&gt;It's obvious that Blizz doesn't want to handle these tickets and has reduced CS staff which reinforces their position of loot trading.
---
So Blizzard should invest the money to hire the appropriate amount of CS staff to accommodate their playing payer base.
---
&gt;Are you going to refuse to play Classic because of loot trading?
---
No. I'd also play it if they had less staggered progression tiers like they originally planned, but the fanbase advocated for a more tiered system like private servers use and hey guess what, Blizzard listened and changed their implementation.
---
&gt;Could it happen...sure...can you be preventative about it...yes. If it happens it happens. Try again.
---
Sure, but this is a meaningless thing to say. What if BRD just crashed 10% of the time when you engage Emperor. You could say "if it happens it happens, just try again" but ultimately it has a negative impact on players' enjoyment of the game. The developer of a game has an obligation to maximize players' enjoyment of their game. So they should probably fix things like BRD crashing 10% of the time. 
---
&gt;Not once did anyone ever ninja loot anything because I'd like to think we were all good people.
---
More meaningless statements. "It's never happened to me, so it can't happen to anyone else" is a logical fallacy. Like I mentioned before, if you're going for an ultra rare item you're going to be running with a lot of random people in PUGs. That's just the nature of the game when you're trying to get in 10+ dungeon clears a day.
---
&gt;It's like when a higher level player keeps ganking you and camping you. If you go to a GM they will simply tell you to call some friends to help you, or hearth and change zones or log out for a while and come back later. 
---
PvP is accepted game design in classic WoW. Loot sharing is not accepted game design in classic WoW. Your arguments make no sense. **You're just not getting it.**
---
&gt;In the end it's up to you to choose what position you put yourself in.
---
This reminds me of the flawed logic where people try to rationalize rapes because the rape victims were "asking for it." Very dumb comment.
---
I see that hunters are good at 1v1 pvp. How do they hold in BGs?
---
My ultimate goal is to be a well known pvp hunter and I want to get high in the ranks. Is it common for hunters to achieve this? I know they have deadzone and such, but do they still kick ass in BGs generally speaking?
---
Thanks!
---
I average 20 dreamfoil and 5 gromsblood a lockout, it's definitely a major factor in what keeps dreamfoil prices around 10g as for how often it is used.  
---
Mislooting was rare in my experience. 
---
Great! But I need a sword and a bow as well... 
---
Unkillable cthun
---
Thorium arrows are gained from a repeatable quest that turns thorium bullets into arrows. So as a engi it's great.
---
As for 2nd profession, you want something that makes you gold. This could be skinning if you go for devilsaurs, herbalism if you like herbing, enchanting if you want to solo diremaul tribute(DE'ing shards is more profit), and so on. Really just your pick, there's really no other profession with actual inpacts other than gold generation.
---
Agreed. Been saying this from the start.
---
I don't remember. But we came there when Stormreaver was having some hardware issues at the launch of Vanilla.
---
Lol ill force you to use it wrong than ill wank your lil dinky and make you cry and submit and be my lil bitch lul
---
"Text Post Thursdays" or something might be a good way to gauge interest in this without plunging the whole sub in headfirst.
---
The problem with that is that this is a 15 year old game... aside from speculation (which is often downvoted), newbie questions (often downvoted), or theorycrafting (already solved for), there's not a lot to actually *discuss.*  So discussion turns to the same few nostalgia conversations over and over again, and while it's absolutely fun the first few times sharing your funny WoW memories, there's really just not a ton of content to serve as the foundation for talking.  So those nostalgia conversations slowly morph into nostalgia art, and that's where we are now.
---
It's kind of a natural endpoint for subs like this, I think.
---
Now you're just talking as if you were paranoid, angry and didn't get what you want as a teenager. Really.
---
Loot trading is a very efficient and working system, you crying about things that could possibly happen because your faith in humanity died out long time ago.. Is just not really valid.
---
If someone ninja, report him / her and tell your guild about the player. A player that ninja loot will get a bad rep and will have a hard time getting a group for instance. Just like it was in vanilla.
---
You're talking like ninja looting wasn't a thing, it was. This won't increase it, since it's about player behaviour. And you can report it just like anything else.  People will get punished, just like they used to get.
---
Lmao, you can try, cuck. You should stick to retail wow where you belong. You ain’t good enough to be running with the big boys. 
---
I like the “low quality” memes.  I don’t mind who likes what on here, but I’m happy to see something other than a wall of text rehashing mechanics I don’t care too much about. (I completely understand that many DO and I never have the inkling to downvote or remove such posts.)
---
I usually just move on from those posts and enjoy either some discussion relevant to my interests or some good old comic relief àla memes.
---
My point in all this is that I don’t want my voice to be completely shutdown on the topic of liking a bit of both worlds.
---
One of the advantages of the slower leveling in Classic you'll have a lot of time to get used to your abilities as you level.  By the time you're 60 you should have your skills down pat.  Stance dancing might the only hard this at cap.
---
There are lots of race picking guides you can fine on youtube.  Orc is one of the best all around warrior races.  But at the end of the day, skill and gear will always beat racial choice.
---
Okay, cool thank you for the info! I figured as much and that’s why I’m reserving my judgement until I get a pet on the hunter at least. I forgot to add I don’t typically like/play casters due to the immobility while casting, so I guess a lot will see how levelling once I get a pet on the hunter goes haha. 
---
I don't even have 39 friends on Facebook...
---
lol everyone is making it seem like Classic will be 90% populated by players trying to abuse the loot trading system to steal items.  
---
This guy wins. What an unexpected spot amongst people suggesting linking park and slipknot. Wish I could play with you lad
---
Yeah 1-10 as lock is easier than any other class imo. 1-10 as hunter is kind rough although I found it fun trying to run around and kite mobs.
---
Hello!
---
I'm looking for a casual/semi hardcore raiding guild (**EU - PVP/PVE - ALLIANCE**)
---
I'm 29 years old, live in Sweden and a father since 2018.
---
I played wow since beta but I think the charm and social aspect died somewhere after Wotlk and the itch to keep playing hasn't returned until the announcement of World of Warcraft Classic.
---
I'm looking for that combination of making friends and actually interacting with other players in combination with that vanilla raiding experience we all love and miss!
---
* Intended region: **EU**
---
* Intended server type: **PvP or Normal**
---
* Intended faction: **Alliance**
---
* Intended raid/play times: **Evenings from around 7**
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild: **Social experience-&gt;Raiding-&gt;PvP**
---
I'm leaning towards playing Warlock, I played as my first character back in Vanilla and missed it ever since.  
---
**Contact** me up if you are starting/know a guild that share my mindset and are looking for players.
---
Thanks for the input!  I definitely agree that the grind to 60 will help me get accustomed to the intricacies of tanking on Classic.  I'm looking forward to it!
---
I'm sorry that I cannot answer your question since I don't have the experience, but can you elaborate on Shaman some more?  I am very interested in Shaman as my main choice for Classic and you seem like you have a lot of experience with the class.  Your thoughts, pros, cons on shaman?
---
Someone fooled a gallery full of artists that a random pineapple they had left on a table was art, to the extent that the gallery put a glass case over it and put it on display.
---
Anything can be art apparently, so yes art.
---
&gt;they don't have enough data for recreating patch progression
---
They just said they do....
---
&gt;To do that, we’re planning to mirror the approach taken by original WoW, with patches paired together. We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x, then the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4, the third Classic update will have 1.5 and 1.6 content, and so on.

Only in your head, OP.
---
Just do it how og vanilla was. Don’t see what’s so hard about all of this. 
---
You're a gentleman and a scholar, sir
---
Then don't answer.
---
They do lower the price of mana pots though
---
Wow you're such a troll.  You just want to belittle anyone that doesn't agree with you and put them down.

"stupid"

Is the hyacinth macaw exclusive to deadmines in vanilla? In my mind they only drop from bloodsails in SV near bootybay.

Also im not sure about the green spider and the brown/grey wolf wich you can get via quest in.... blackrock?
---
Nice UI 
---
Because they will intervene in cases of raid leaders making a mis-click or an honest mistake. If blizz wants to automate what used to take a ticket, limited trading for RLs only would allow them to fix their own mistakes without opening the door for the other kinds of abuses in 5-mans and such.
---
No no no, bloodvine is bis till naxx. Especially with 300 tailoring
---
Why do you feel that is necessary?
---
/u/famasfilms wasn't saying anything about accuracy, he was saying his guild beats Ragnaros before the submerge phase.
---
Ragnaros has the lava eruptions / elemental phase on private servers.
---
I like your energy but when you run out of mana ill be twindly winking you until you squeel little piggy
---
Like others said, they dont have pre 1.12 patch data. Even getting that 1.12 actual data was very lucky from a backup drives backup folder ... 
---
Wow, you're missing the whole point.
---
The problem with loot trading is that it enables collusion that is 100% unprovable. That's why people are up-in-arms on this topic. Ninja looting absolutely was a thing, but it was visible to the whole group and could be screenshotted. Not to mention, if somebody has made a conscious decision to ninja loot, loot trading does nothing since they can simply not trade.
---
And you're solution to the problem is....report them? The whole reason we're going down this rabbit hole is because Blizz doesn't want GMs to handle the reports.
---
Loot trading creates a vector for unprovable collusion while not even solving ninja looting.
---
I would say that if you don't intend to try and rank into the higher levels of pvp, pick whichever you think looks better.  I personally think rogue armor looks better on a troll since an orc is just so bulky - plus their run animation is very goofy looking to me.
---
If you have any intentions of trying to pvp at a high level, then pick Orc hands down for stun resist.
---
&gt;Stormreaver 
---
Definitely Finreaver, based from all those character names
---
As far as I'm aware most private servers have them working. Some are missing the visual I think. There certainly are some that have it mostly accurate.
---
You’ll run out of health first. I hope you like tea bags 
---
Maybe you guys should go on a forum to have forum posts not reddit 
---
I guess you only raided with low IQ Neanderthals randomly clicking accept on every window that pops up. I guess it kinda proves it when you say you were raiding 12 hours straight. Maybe actiblizzon should add Neanderthal mode so the specials can all coexist in their safe place with loot sharing and 1 click reporting.
---
 It’s how just how the game worked. Why fuck with it?
---
When the actual game content is no longer satisfying people resort to their own content.
---
I’m sure that conversation was had more than once.  People do weirder stuff on Craigslist.  
---
This is not mutually exclusive from the previous statement in any way. 
---
It has arguably "truer" colors or something like that
---
You still haven't explained how advocating that he played Vanilla when /u/Blarghinston on reddit believes that he doesn't is bad for the community?

Also, you got a source on him right-click report abusing in the demo?

 ([barrens.chat](https://barrens.chat) website have a post for : What we know so far (bluepost and actual verify content)
---
**It is included in your normal WoW monthly subscription cost. For those  who do not own a World of Warcraft product, I imagine there will be an  extra one-off price for the game itself.**
---
[**https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=850**](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=850)
---
I believe that means that they're locking content based on patch level, not actually *updating* content as it changed ie. gear, abilities, etc.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but that quote doesn't seem to prove your point.
---
I asked you to specify as 7-10am is different depending on if you're EU or US ;P You specified a time, so you need to also specify a time zone. Best of luck to you though trying to find an early morning guild. It might be easier if you check what 7-10am would be in the various NA time zones, and actively hunting for a guild with those time zones. Sadly even inr etail there are not many guilds who raid that early.
---
It should just be like it was. You fuck up, tough titty. Vanilla wasn’t a care bear loot piñata like today and that’s what made it good. JUST LEAVE IT ALONE!
---
Cleanse.Purge. Kill.
---
Please, so much this. It's a unique opportunity to step away from dumbing things down and spice the solved endgame to boot.
---
You mean rogues farming frozen runes? Those things paid for my epic flying mount on all my alts in BC. :D
---
I found this: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Companion
---
It has some info for vanilla.  It should show you each expansion the specific pets were added.  Might not be a complete guide, but it's a start.  
---
That's double the twist
---
User name checks out!
---
Really appreciate it, and your completely right, unlikely a guild like this exists but that is a good way to actively search for something. If I was more competent around guild management etc. I would set one up as I do think there is a potential niche for players like me! 
---
Thanks again!
---
Just make the loot trading usable in 40man raids while using masterlooter. You have literally cut down the possibility to wrongfully use the system by 95%. Leaves only pug raids that might have a issue. And even then you could see if the guy running the pug is a asshole and not join his groups ever again.
---
As far as I have seen, Druids excel at tanking 5 mans.  Especially at the lower levels, WC/SFK, they are able to generate much better aoe threat with swipe than Warriors of the same level.  The areas where Warriors have the big tanking advantages only apply in raids (maxing +def)
---
Last summer I played feral Druid to lvl 45 on a private server and was always accepted as a tank for 5-mans, no problems.
---
What? What do you want? WHY do you keep touching me?!
---
Idk man, this is top tier pvp strat. Bubble and hearth off cd, so you have an escape. Having engineering, and knowing how to apply reckoning to ruin filthy hordes day. Yeah man, checks out, not noob.
---
Prot Warrior vs Prot/Holy Paladin
---
Goal: 5-man dungeon with perhaps pug raids/guild that raids once a week
---
Reason: High utility, Melee class
---
Time investment: 5-10 hours a week.
---
Gold will be acquired through herbalism, dungeons and an alt if I find time enough to play.
---
Side note: Probably rolling Alliance, I value armor looks and weapon animations - Prot warrior would be a NE female and Paladin would be a Dwarf female. I like Male Humans as well but every min/maxer will roll one!
---
If classic start getting further development they would need a massive influx of new developers / writers / etc. These people have already proven in retail that they hate the Horde, there's no reason to assume they wouldn't keep their biases out of a hypothetical 1.13+.
---
Just have it be raid only...
---
~500g or so to progress the questline to last part.
---
The actual items to do the quest with are optional, you can ask/pay another warlock to summon the boss.
---
Stop calling them shitty
---
That's what is making this so tough!  I'm not sure.  On the one hand I should try something new, but on the other hand I really do enjoy Shaman playstyle immensely.
---
In true hybrid fashion I do plan on doing a little of everything.  I don't plan on being in some bleeding edge min-max guild.  But I do plan on being in a guild that can clear raids.  Semi-Hardcore? With equal parts pvp/pve mixed in.
---
I mean, to each their own and all that. But I tend to downvote all the low effort art and memes. Like /u/LiterallyRob said, I'd much rather discuss anything related to actual Classic content. But yeah, don't min me, I'll just keep downvoting anything that isn't just that.
---
I'm pretty sure they have a separate classic/vanilla section  now.
---
They aren't doing patch progression, they are using 1.3 &amp; 1.4 to illustrate which content is gonna be available by refering to patch 1.X
---
You should see my personal setup 😏
---
I levelled in retail vanilla and on private servers as feral including tanking/dpsing dungeons. Back in the day, people could be dicks about it and say that you weren't a real tank. It wasn't super often, but it did happen.  
---
On private servers, I haven't had anyone refuse to invite due to "feral not being able to tank &lt;insert dungeon name here&gt;."
---
Bears are more than capable of any 5 man content and most people realize that now. Also you don't have to go restoration if you don't want to. If you are upfront with what you want to do and say you are willing to respec or switch roles for the good of the guild, that will go a long way. On Darrowshire I was feral kitty DPS in MC/BWL/AQ40 but I popped out to assist with Abolish Poison, Remove Curse, tossing a heal, etc. You bring utility as a druid, not top tier dps/tank/heals.
---
No one can do what a druid can, but as a druid you have to play the class properly. Being a druid is all about switching roles as needed: be flexible. If you do that and help the guild out as needed, it is likely that they will be pretty supportive of you.
---
&gt; all info is well known 
---
I believe that Classic will be so different from what we know now from private servers, that there will be loads of topics worth discussing.
---
I will most interested on what people will deal with 6 hrs CD on Ony/Neff buff, 2 hrs CD on Black Lotus respawn time, and the sheer amount of info that will come from raids, that will be very different from private servers (armor values, spell resists values, crit values, etc.)
---
Of everything we know now, probably half will be different in Classic.
---
Modern screenshot.  So you must have forgot too lol
---
You don't have to clear MC the first week. It's such a strnage thing to stress about.
---
Why is Ron Jeremy making WoW Classic Youtube videos?
---
I don't think loot trading is necessary. I've been arguing against it since they first mentioned it. However, IF we are going to end up stuck with it, there are things they can do to mitigate it's damage.
---
If you are asking why it might be necessary to let people know a loot trade occurs, at all? Well the purpose of that is to combat dishonest behavior. Players could all roll need on an item even if they don't need the item purely to trade it to a friend in the group. Getting in game mail and a whisper would let the rest of the group know that the item was traded.
---
Imagine an UBRS run. Half the group is with 1 guild. The guild has 2 rogues, the tank, a healer and a hunter in group. One of their rogues needs TrueStrike shoulders. The group pugs the last dps spot and it's a random hunter. Group fills up and they start the run. TrueStrike drops, and random hunter rolls on it and so does guild rogue that needs it. But then so do the hunter and rogue that dont need it. Why? So they can give it to their guild mate who does. In game mail and a whisper would let the rest of the group know what just went down. It would allow the word to get out to the rest of the server the same way it would back in vanilla regarding a ninja looter.
---
I just lagged and dc'ed all of mc/bwl/aq lol but my guild kept me cuz I was a priest and one of the top healers when I wasnt lagging.  I would dc everytime someone in my family picked up one of the landlines so I would hide the phones before important bosses...
---
They only talk about unlocking dungeons/raids. No class balance changes, progressive itemization or other balancing changes, like stats of NPCs. At best they plan to release some world drop items patch by patch.
---
I think i would know from doing 10 - 25 in the barrens. sure there were people but never so many that you had to move to a location to get anything done. if anything id say that barrens was the most fun part of the leveling cycle. and i ended up training both a shaman and a warlock at the same time (one friend started late and i wanted to keep up with both of them, ended up having 2 characters at the same level cause of that) so i got to experience the barrens on a private server with a 14k (peak) live pop twice with no issues. Lol
---
I dislike him.  Says the same shit in each video.  Also idk why but it bugs me when people call in vanilla. Like that’s so unprofessional 
---
That's crazy, was there really nothing more you did? I don't even drink coffee, trying to avoid dairy at the moment actually...
---
1.12 =/= previous patches 
---
Yeah, but they want more than 3k at launch to solve the tourist problem. There idea is lots of people will leave very soon after launch, it's better to not open too many servers at the beginning and then having dead ones 1 month in. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ors0wpcVDcc This is a good playlist. Synthwave is also really chill for the long grind. I tend to go for more aggressive EDM in raids. Old nu metal mixes are also pretty good for getting hyphy in the BGs. 
---
I fear that without a healthy injection of gold into the economy that people will choose to sit on their world drops, devilsaur leather, and black lotuses out of a desire to get more gold per item. I realize how inflation works, but I think there will be a certain expectation for people regardless of the actual economic situation. 
---
Thanks man. I was pretty sold on hunter before so now it's looking even more likely I'll roll one
---
Nothing is as fun as getting all your mobs instant tagged by a moonfire while they are still spawning, don't you know? 
---
Yeah, that logo is driving me nuts for some reason &gt;.&lt;
---
Best to do it later in the summer. That way you can get full playtime if it comes out before ur vacation time rather than at the tail end of ur vacation time Bc u guessed too soon. 
---
Where did this attitude of people expecting GMs to fix their mistakes come from? Why is the loot trading topic so big?
---
If loot goes to the wrong person for whatever reason, that's too bad, but it's not Blizzards responsibility to supply tools or manual assistance to fix those mistakes.
---
In my opinion they should just leave the loot system as it is working now on private servers, without possible GM intervention.
---
Why waste time on this matter, really?
---
You think this screenshot is from after BC got released? Why is that?
---
Prot and fury/arms share 0 gear but every dps war will be expected to keep a set of rank gear in there bags to throw on for garr.
---
I hope it doesn't, but swapping and gold selling will happen regardless if it's against the TOS or not. if it becomes too big of a problem, blizzard might decide that the token is the lesser of two evils and introduce it to classic. 
---
My wife was, uh, *extra appreciative* that I had extra gold when she hit 70 in BC so she could get her flying mount.
---
Keep it up my dude any chance for tanaris?
---
As an offtank you usually get all prot gear before fury warriors so it's not a big deal, and you can wear QS for a long time.
---
As for leveling build I strongly recommend the typical arms spec. It's actually really nice for tanking dungeons and you won't be useless outside of one. 
---
DK was wrath(level 80) not tbc. 
---
But other than that; 
---
1. Well you need to be like most classes and close to bis, and you need to have gear enough to make the threat you need to make in raids.
---
2. No you share loot with the other warriors in the raid, some items that are considered good for threat, might be items that dps warriors are looking for also, but this is a guildcall.
---
3. You can level as any specc and still be able to tank dungeons. 
---
Beats grinding dailies.
---
My man, in vanilla they could do the same shit they'd just open a ticket with a GM to get the piece moved.
---
Was it as seamless - no. People still got dicked out of loot all the time though and I personally dont believe in policing it. If it happens enough from the same guild they'll eventually get a reputation on the server.
---
It's not x-realm where they'll never see you again.
---
&gt; And you can report it just like anything else. People will get punished, just like they used to get.
---
&gt;
---
I don't know why people think this happened.  Needing to vendor/DE/whatever was specifically listed as examples of ninja looting Blizz wouldn't punish.
---
Onyxia with conflag fireballs was insanely annoying though.  It was almost better to bring less people because of it.  There isn't that much room to spread out in that room and still be able to move around for deep breath/whelps positioning.  It did however cause one of the fastest raid wipes I have ever seen though (about same speed as Cthun lasers).
---
The Tower to the south west at the entrance is missing, but the overall look is awesome =)
---
Nice.
---
I just give up of my troll shaman after reading this  
---
Storm, Beef and Fire hear my call..
---
These threads are endless, haha. It seems like the best compromise is to just get loot trading out of dungeons. Or even simpler, make it so it only works when master loot is enabled.
---
Hunters kick MAJOR ass in BGs/world. Pretty high skill cap, too. You murder mana based classes, as well as rogues and druids. It's easy for hunters to get into the rank14 premades, due to their ability to Viper Sting everything, defend bases/flags, and even act as an escort for your FC.
---
Not even epic flying? Geez.
---
Let’s face it, you’re still a noob. 
---
That's a load o crap!
---
It doesn’t matter because he will have a quest reward from a level 20 class quest that he can use for like 10 levels and then you will be aiming for whirlwind weapon. Then you both can also use bonebiter from the ally sm quest. If smites mighty hammer drops in deadmines then make sure you get it. Anything around level 20 that’s a 2h should go to you because the paladin should get verigans fist as soon as the quest opens up. 
---
You will be perfectly fine going 2h as there is all of these quests that negate your worries and I highly suggest you go 2h Bc sweeping strikes is amazing when utilized correctly. 
---
Right. Your post was full of logical fallacies and non sequiturs. I even explained quite a few of them to you. It's not a personal attack; it's an attempt to inform you that your argument can't be taken seriously when there's no logical value to it. 
---
Like, the rape thing wasn't *literally* about rape. It was an example of a logical fallacy that was designed to be easy to understand. I don't think I can simplify this any further.
---
In the future, if you want to have a discussion on the internet where people take you seriously and don't downvote your comments, you may want to take a moment to consider the logical validity of the argument you're attempting to present. 
---
&gt; Reason: High utility
---
Paladin for sure
---
A lot of tanks actually want accuria, onslaught girdle, ragna cape etc. 
---
Used CRTs. Still cringe.
---
You can always tank levelling dungeons as any spec so my suggestion is level as arms. Ones you get to raiding there is almost no gear that is shared between tanks and dps how ever, some of the dps warriors will have to get a tank set aswell as there dps set and if you get to the four horsemen you need alot of geared tanks. That being said most warriors in an guild will be dps warriors you will only need 2 dedicated tanks for most of the game
---
Yeah, I played until end of Cata but mostly raided casually there. I didn't want to get into too much detail. I felt like I was rambling already (as usual when I start to talk about classic wow).
---
I got the priest, shammy, warrior and DK to 80 before quitting.
---
That's good to know in regards to dungeon tanking. 
---
Guess I'll always will be... /sigh
---
Thrash blade is a prebis option for raiding and should never be passed up as a warrior for the staff. 
---
The classical economics of up votes and down votes. 
---
I agree with you. Dwarf priests were definitely wanted in vanilla, but it was never "DORF OR NOTHING"
---
If you want human or NE or whatever, pick what you want.  A good guild will pick good players to join, while a dwarf might be ideal, it isn't necessary.  We had 0 dwarf priests in my guild and we had no issue killing Nefarian for a server first. The fears never wiped us.
---
Noones just senseless bashing
---
Right but any loot master that gives Acura to a tank b4 a fury war needs to be removed for the loot council 
---
Cheers mate, this might make the levelling process a little easier.
---
I had a miserable experience last time I spoke to a GM. 
---
I had let my account lapse, and had built some lvl 20 twinks for the occasional BG, which you can play without having an active account. When my account expired, I found myself unable to queue for BG's, so I contacted a GM. The GM jerked me around like it was his job to try not to help me, before finally helping me. It was a terrible customer service experience. 
---
Hateful strike is an ability and can **not** crit. Not a single tank in the history of vanilla WoW died to a critical hateful stike.
---
This is getting fucking gay.  Im gonna bounce
---
I played throughout the entirety of vanilla in a pretty good guild and good players.
---
I never heard of a single person AoE farming DM. 
---
I still cant decide what to play :(
---
I kind of want to be a warlock, but i also want to play a Dwarf.
---
Dwarf i think i'd pretty much 'have' to play priest...which i wouldnt mind too much, and have healing experience in the past on Live...im just not sure i want to level as a priest.
---
Also theres just something...i dunno...'right' about a warlock for me.  A Gnome Warlock was my first toon in Wrath, so it'll always be special for me....
---
Dammit though, i wanna play a Dwarf D:
---
I was always pretty methodical in my approach to the game and usually put in a lot of time planning and theorycrafting. Hopefully I can find a guild where I can be one of the MT's.
---
Rekt
---
I played for server launches back in the day, they're fine and the rush of competing for mobs is part of the experience.
---
Sharding will ruin the community, and be a slippery slope: only for launch is gonna be hard to keep if having it for launch causes the area after that to be a shitshow. If it makes it to areas defined by the crowding like STV or Hillsbrad it literally won't be vanilla anymore.
---
If you don't want to be with **all** the players on your server and have the positive **and** negative interactions that come with this, that's what retail is for.
---
My guild is torn on this. We played Vanilla -&gt; Wrath as Alliance and then swapped to Horde in Cata for a fresh start. Now we're preparing to go back to Classic and can't decide which faction. Feels like it's time for a swap, but we did already do Vanilla as Alliance, so this would be anopportunity to do it for the first time as horde.
---
I'm leaning toward pushing for Alliance soley because pallies are OP in PvE.
---
Legacies:  Tides of the Serpent was fun.  It was like proto-WoW for me.  
---
Vanilla has flaws too. Having flaws doesnt mean the game should be changed. If anything we asked for Vanilla flaws and all. The only major flaws people complain about is flying mounts ruining world PVP, but the argument could be made that happend long before with cross realm battlegrounds. Not sure if you played on Gummy's TBC private server, but there was lots of world PVP at ring of blood, the bone wastes, and the meeting stone in netherstorm.
---
There are ways around the high pop/ low pop problem (one of which I suggested above)
---
But an OSRS option would create it's own issues. Naxx gear is so powerful compared to the rest of the gear in game that it was still worn in SSC. Anything added would either have to completely trivialize Naxx gear and therefore all the progression before it, or it would be tuned so high that only Naxx raiders could play it. Plus, most of the content people would want added would basically be content Blizzard added in later expansions. Uldum? Added later. Kara? Added later. Hyjal? Added later. The only one maybe is the Emerald Dream.
---
Doing a TBC &amp; WOTLK Classic would be the cheapest and easiest thing for them to do. From reading here, several discords, etc it seems to be what most people would want anyways. I think IF they did an OSRS style expansion they should do it after a wotlk xpac.
---
Bears eat nuts berries anything sweet or salty really 
---
They may have drifted away from the original ideals of the Horde but the game has been focused around the Horde for years
---
Sorting by new is 2019 LUL
---
GW was limited to level 20 but yeah kind of. GW was different tho in a few key areas. You could be a PRICK in GW and if it limited your access to groups you could easily reroll and disassociate from your other character. The time commitment involved in leveling in WoW usually dissuaded that move. 
---
Pros are:
---
* Elemental 30/0/21 spec is a spec that can both PvE and PvP. Not many classes can raid and pvp with the same spec.
---
* Early travel boost with Ghost Wolf can make your life easier.
---
* Vast amounts of utility with totems to fit any situation.  More utility than a Paladin for example. (Paladin's can only have one aura out at a time)
---
* Weapon enchantments to fit any situation or gear level you are at.  
---
* Able to fill all 3 roles in 5-man dungeons (tank, heal, dps) (viably, I didn't say they'd be great at all 3!)
---
* Gear flexibility.  Having access to cloth/leather/mail armor; as well as Staves, Maces, Axes, Daggers, and Shields.  (As well as the 2H variants with the appropriate talent).  This allows you to "gear scavenge" more effectively for stats than other classes, especially while leveling.
---
* Class Fantasy (spells, melee weapons, totems, etc) all come together to make the class very fun to play.
---
* Raid comps will try to take at least 4-8 shaman so usually easy to find raid groups.  Dungeon groups generally love shaman as well since you provide backup heals, wipe prevention (with Ankh), and utility with totems of course.
---
* Only class that can purge enemy buffs. Paladins will hate you.
---
Cons are:
---
* High mana dependence. Against Priests or hunters in PvP you'll find yourself severely weakened if they drain your mana.
---
* Leveling speed is average to slightly below average (I think shamans rank 6 or 7 on the list of leveling specs).
---
* Gear in Vanilla isn't optimized well, and if it is optimized well, it's for Restoration spec only.
---
* Since raids will take many shaman, gearing as a shaman can be particularly rough since you'll be competing with many more members of your class for gear.
---
* Kiteable by many other classes.
---
* May be forced into a full resto spec when progression raiding.
---
* Hybrid Tax - Decent at all things (which is what makes them strong in PvP) but every other class effectively fufills your main "role" better in PvE  You essentially are only there for Reincarnation and Totems.  Can be a little disenfranchising if people try to measure your worth by heal/dps meters alone.
---
I really hope you change your attitude so we all can get the vanilla WoW we remember :)
---
Planning on trying to level a paladin mostly with dungeons should I go prot or holy?
---
I'm guessing because it isn't technically directly related to classic wow. But indirectly it definitely is. That one should've stayed IMO.
---
Yes it is provabe, the chat is logged and as a GM you can see the log how people rolled. If someone steal an item and give it to someone else it's ninja looting, which you report like always (and it was solved with mutes bans, and the harshest one bad rep on the server).
---
People who see loot trading as a problem WANT to see it as such.
---
That has been proven time and time again to be a _terrible_ idea. There's a reason subreddits have rules.
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah a lot of these changes were mechanics that were plain unfun or impossible under intended circumstances. They don't need to be undone. Same with some of the mob removal, it doesn't make it easier with them gone, just less tedious. They don't need to return, fighting the same pack over and over and over is just pointless slowdown for the sake of slowdown.
---
But that said, yeah I'm sure I recall some bosses getting nerfed here and there as the next raid approaches, that kind of nerf can be undone, just as long as we keep in mind that RNG should never be the deciding factor in a kill or wipe (such as the Ony change) and that something taking a long time is different to something being hard. We should absolutely shoot for the hardest possible versions of each boss for sure, but not though plain having 5billion HP and having to do each mechanic 100 times before they finally die.
---
With the controller it would probably be near impossible to play, but i could honestly see myself playing from third person perspective in VR with my keyboard and mouse doing raids and shit.
---
I could only imagine how great the fucking wotlk dungeons must look in VR.
---
I wouldn't mind if they skipped Loot Trading actually. But it's a good solution for Blizzard and nothing that'll make any kind of difference at all for the players (except getting misslooted items faster).
---
So why not :)
---
If you buy reforged now, you get access to Frozen Throne and something else, I think. I picked up my pre-order and am working my way through the settlement of Durotar campaign - really good stuff.
---
I know a lot of people on my server that got banned because of ninja looting too much, but before that they were unable to join any of the casual or hardcore guilds and had great problems trying to find groups.
---
That's punishment it self. It's a server issue to stop ninja looters.
---
Already decided my main (hunter), but i want to have a healer alt. I'm between Holy Priest and Resto Shaman. I'm leaning more torwards the latter, but people say Priest it's better and easier for people with not a lot of experience in a healing rol.
---
I appreciate your insight Matt, I totally get what you're saying and that is something to seriously consider. Made so many alts back in vanilla due to that same reasoning. 
---
Launch Cata had you go into raids while in blues, it had a lot of faults (lack of endgame content), but I really liked that it was trying to dial a lot of the stuff back to how it was pre-Wrath. A shame the community hated that.
---
You still can! With the people on your shard.

One of those is not like the others lol
---
Thats cool thanks alot
---
The horde will fall!! 
---
Tauren will have more HP for tanking, but it's not huge.
---
Orc has solid warrior racials with Axe skill, Stun Resist, and Blood fury.
---
Undead and Troll I feel are not as good for warriors on Horde side.
---
yep WotF is probably the best PvP racial.
---
&gt; what of classes? because i love my shadow priest and my warlock, while i do find i can do most of my questing by myself in zuldzar, i think its cheap that you can switch between all three disciplines of a class, though i may be just thinking that classic locked you into one sub class.
---
You weren't hard-locked into any role, but the price to change was high enough that it kind of served to prohibit frequent swapping.  Some don't like this -- maybe they want to tank through the week and PvP on weekends and not have to spend a huge chunk of gold each time to do so.  But others *did* like it, because of how it supplemented the idea of class identity.  You weren't just "Warrior #1936," you were Naytreox, that guy who everyone on the server knew was a badass Arms Warrior.  You were Jimbob, that Orc Warrior who was the MT of the top guild and the first on the server to have a [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19019).  You were Valtieri, that Tauren Warrior who's *always* online and *always* down to run UBRS, but doesn't raid.
---
It was easier to develop an identity, and it all served to better emphasize the "MMO" part of MMORPG.
---
Alts really were not a popular, nor realistic, thing in Vanilla. Sure, some people had a Mage or Hunter alt for farming, but their gear was shit and weren't very serious with them. Your expectations, even with your amount of free time, are kind of ridiculous.
---
I'm not the same guy who's done the other ones. This really isn't that good 
---
I remember that exact argument being used in a run once stating if it drops, paladins cant have it because they get a free mount. Unbelievable to think back on.
---
3 people who could all use the item agree to collude to funnel that item to one of them. Maybe because they have it already, maybe they're friends, maybe one is paying the others, many possible reasons. If they already have the item, they unequip it so nobody will even know. 
---
Now the other party members who would also be rolling 1vs1 are instead rolling 1vs3 as those 3 are colluding. 0 paper trail. This is going to be in the back of everybody's mind every time you join a group and see a few people from the same guild. Just the possibility of collusion is going to make people suspicious. 
---
And all of this for what? You know who is seeing a problem they WANT to see as such? It's the people obsessed with miss loots and miss clicks. I can count on a single hand the number of times that has happened in 2 years of Vanilla and many more years on private servers. THAT'S the non issue.
---
For leveling nothing is better than "TheFatRat" songs.  (like this one:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xai5u\_tnk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xai5u_tnk) )
---
That's going to happen. The best thing Blizzard can do is make sure it's cutting down on bots. If so, and a real person farms the gold in Classic, it seems totally fair to me that he does w/e he ants with the gold.
---
Do u have other zones done as well? 
---
I'm shocked no one has said this yet, but pally. 
---
You can heal for ez raid slots, or heal/ret for pvp.
---
Hunter and holy pally are an incredibly strong pvp combo, really assisting each others weaknesses. 
---
The only problem with pally is they are boring as fuck to level.
---
Undead is way cooler and WotF will save you so many times in PvP.
---
Off-topic, is Reach out on PC already? Im so confused about the MCC release dates..
---
If they go tbc -&gt; wrath they will have to do cata up to legion as well. As people will get nostalgic for those expansions as well. And end up going full circle.
---
Constantly showing how horrible and pathetic the horde is, yes. A new cinematic came out yesterday, and it basically confirms SoO 2.0 is coming. GG Blizzard, gonna love it when Baine takes over as warchief only to get shanked by a void creature a few months later having achieved nothing at all while Gallywinx preps a nuke on Stormwind or something. 
---
My wife has over 300 runs on live trying to get it and still doesn't.
---
Can confirm.  When hype got too hot for me to handle, I leveled a Human Mage up to ~30 on a pserver and I felt dirty every single minute of it.
---
If I had to guess it’s because none of the Vanilla dungeons were revamped during classic. 
---
So....it doesn’t pertain to Classic. 
---
Returning to some of those old mechanics would make things more challenging and enjoyable, and some would just make things more janky and RNG based. I would definitely like it if they reverted some of the more straightforward raid damage nerfs though. 
---
Hey guys, i'm torn between Rogue or Warrior. I will do everything from Raid to PvP, however the PVE aspect doesn't matter in my decision, so which of these classes are better in PvP? 
---
I saw a lot of people saying warriors are great in pvp but i honestly remember them just getting fucked by frost mages and getting rekt in bgs due to them being meele and having 5 people focusing you to death (more of a melee problem than warrior, but i feel rogue have a lot more resources to counter that)
---

---
Agreed, the best system I was ever a part of was a point system with LC oversight.
---
&gt;but by amount of comments and clicks.
---
This is how /r/askreddit works and it doesn't generate quality. It generates questions that anyone can answer.
---
You don't have to kite. You can very easily grind to 60 without kiting as a hunter. 
---
And why would a rogue roll on that big axe he can't use which he accidently traded to another player afterwards? Like dude, you WANT to disbelive in Loot Trading and come up with scenarious that will RUIN your reputation on the server in vanilla, in a way that no one really dares to use since it's easy to prove with screenshots and conversation.
---
And if you're really that scared of loot trading fucking it up for you, play with your friends and your guild.
---
[inkarnate.com](https://inkarnate.com) really is one of the best ones currently.
---
True, I went by what I saw in the map and not the in-game! 
---
We don't intend on bringing dps warriors to raids till we get some warriors with BWL gear since tanks will be more valuable in the early phases of content ( we might make an exception to a try hard though). We just have not been too impressed with pre bis dps warriors.
---
They actually found it on the same USB that held the sword of a thousand truths!
---
Every ticket response will just be “try checking solutions on wowhead”
---
There are no guides because no one does this. You will soon know why. 
---
Leaning pretty hard towards pally after reading the replies. Plus freedom on a hunter, and you can buff the pet and hunter separately. Synergy!
---
Look, you're the one that wants to introduce some convoluted loot trading scheme rather than take the simple way out. The onus is on you to provide a compelling case, and all you've managed to say is that loot trading utterly fails to actually solve ninja looting, and does solve an issue of missclicks that many players on this forum with years of WoW experience believe is a total non-issue.

Lol no, my nostalgia isn't that extreme. Might as well play it on dialup as well and pull the plug periodically to simulate server instability.
---
Ehhh, I see what you're getting at but I don't think that's a good idea.
---
I'm totally on board with it being as challenging as release and as close to patch progression as possible but I would much favor the preservation of true Vanilla values than tweak the dynamically for Classic. Even if it means some stuff is slightly easier than it was, due to the 1.12 values. 
---
I use catalog on 4chan.
---
Yeah I have every intention of being flexible as required, and honestly it would be more interesting to cat DPS than heal, although healing is important and I don't mind druid healing at all.
---
Thanks for the answer, hopefully the live classic servers are as friendly as the private servers.
---
sure thing :)

Thank you that was very helpful.  Would you not roll one again simply because you’ve “been there done that” so to speak?

Yah but that Accent coukd probably get you into 200k miles mark
---
1.12 talents + 1.12 combat mechanics + altered itemization + MC/Ony as the top-end content is already way the fuck far from a "preservation of true Vanilla." Depending on how things shake out with the 1.12 numbers, it'll also just be a flat-out bad game. At the very least tuning things to bring the experience back in line in order to create a worthwhile PvE progression that won't have everybody yelling at Blizz to hurry up with phase 2 would be a win.

He's probably referring to this wind serpent.  The white skinned wind-serpent was the rarest of the wind serpent skins due to the fact that the "easily accessible" White Wind Serpents were all casters.

The only two that ARE NOT "caster" pets, are indeed "RARE" spawns.

Thinking of doing this way for maximum novelty, but it's a tough decision. Feels wrong, all the Horde races look cooler, and part of me wants to play Shaman... Also if I go Warrior I'd miss those godlike Orc racials and giant shoulders.

---
Yeah I'm aware of most of them, they're awesome!
---
It doesn't matter. 4chan boards are sorted lists.
---
A new thread goes to the top of the list. Posting a comment in a thread moves it to the top of the list. When a new thread is created the last thread on the list is removed. The result is a natural selection process where the threads most likely to survive are those that generate the most comments up until the point that new comments will no longer "bump" the thread to the top of the list.
---
The result is that controversial stupidity and trolling is best at keeping a thread alive and the higher the board activity the worse this gets because the size of the list size does not change. It doesn't generate quality because quality is not defined by number of comments. 500 people saying stupid is not equivalent to 1 person writing something intelligent.
---
Isn’t there also a Yeti pet from rep? The guys in Feralas up north. 
---
WPvP: Rogue
---
BG: Warrior
---
I guess you want to DPS in raids, both classes are good at it so I think you should base your choice off the PvP part.
---
Thanks I think you're right. My first char day 1 of vanilla was an undead rogue so I'll go with that!
---
I think the totem duty is going to be stressing. I want to heal and I have landed on priest due to ease of leveling and healing powers.
---
My alt is going to be a hunter :) 
---
Your analysis sounds spot on to me.  Warriors are also a lot more gear dependent and harder to level.  They also benefit a lot more from having a healer nearby (do you plan on playing with friends a lot?).  Once geared, they can be really satisfying to pvp with, but in general from level 1-60, I find rogues to be more interesting.  More to think about, more to coordinate.  Both are great though so I can see why it's a tough call.
---
The logic isn't "they haven't seen it so make another".
---
The logic is "shove it down their throats until they get the message".
---
My first character was an undead rogue on EU release so I think undead too, thanks!
---
But you cant judge if a comment is stupid or intelligent without a vote system. And if theres a vote system for comments we're back to where we begon.
---
The issue with discussion platforms are once they get bigger, quallity always go down.
---
I dont think there is one method for all forms. 
---
Yeah I think I'll go with undead after all after all the advice, thanks!
---
Yes undead it is, thanks!
---
Shadow priest levelling can be really easy, if that factors into your decision at all.  Though I would generally recommend playing whatever interests you the most.  Don't worry about what the 'correct' choice is.  You will find groups and be successful healing regardless of the class.
---
&gt; 1.12 talents + 1.12 combat mechanics + altered itemization + MC/Ony as the top-end content is already way the fuck far from a "preservation of true Vanilla."
---
Ok, then I want a hunter buff, so it scales better for Naxx. Since we're no longer concerned, Give Moonkins more mana, since they suck.
---
Nerf Warriors, everyone knows they are too OP.
---
I'm hardly a no changes guy, if we have 1.12, let's play 1.12, not some deformed version of pick and choose what we want in classic.
---
I don't know how feasible paladin tanks are in five mans pre 50, but generally if you want to do a lot of dungeons it's easiest if you are the tank or know one that will always be around.
---
No worries!  
---
I think that they will be fairly friendly, and if they aren't, then it would probably be easy to find a guild that is chill and accepting. I can see more than a few guilds recruiting right now that are not min/max minded.
---
That was extra extra appreciative.
---
Want to? I told you I don't really care, since it'll do the exact same thing for me. It's just "why not" since it just speeds up wrongly looted items faster. Instead of 3-4 days it's instant.
---
EVERYTHING is a issue with you guys, so it's no news that this is. People here on this sub-forum would say they'll never touch Classic WoW if the Create character button was slightly more blood red than the original red color.
---
If what you say is true, people will complain about it and Blizzard will take action. Until then it's a great system that makes it better for players and Blizzard without changing the gameplay of Vanilla.
---

this. 
---
Yea, I’m all about playing a ton when it comes out, but the idea grinding until my eyes bleed sounds awful.
---
I'd fetch some playlists from 2004-2006 because those were the songs I listened to in 2004-2006. 
---
Wait so what's your question? What healing class to roll?
---
Lol I was getting a boner owning you so much.  Felt like a gay lord.
---
Too bad you lost 
---
Go ret. You can still heal just fine.
---
I heard this in Bobby Hill's voice.
---
Oh lord...
---
If you genuinely want to run dungeons a lot, it will be easiest if you play a warrior so you don't have to spend time looking for a tank every time.  But i really do think worrying less about the logistics and more about what role you want to immerse yourself in will lead to higher overall satisfaction.
---
If I play some of that early 2000s rock that became popular for a while I feel anxious. Because that's the kind of music I listened to while farming none-stop.
---
"I've been watching, I've been waiting
---
In the shadows for my time"
---
Ughhh, not sure why I listened to it but now I just can't at all.
---
That’s gonna be a no from me dog
---
For that boss it works.  But dungeons in Vanilla aren't 3-4 bosses long.  You only get one shot at that.
---
THAT’S WHAT I SAID! Lol
---
Nah, leaning Priest if I go heals. I’m curious about the perspective of someone who was a strong DPS player and swapped to healing. Also curious about the perspective on those who healed in Vanilla.
---
My concern is that my skill set might not translate well to raid healing, which I imagine is just heavily reactive. Also worried I might not enjoy it as much if I lose the competitive nature of competing on meters (though I know HPS meters have similar competition).
---
You do regen mana, thats the reason druids can be very efficient levelers
---
I think it would be cool but i doubt any expansion, no matter what, can save wow from not falling into the same mistakes again.
---
Let’s just enjoy classic for a few years and leave it at that.
---
&gt;can't judge if a comment is stupid or intelligent without a vote system
---
Have you considered using your brain to form your own opinion instead of letting reddit points determine it for you?
---
That's why I always wished Blizzard would have added a 20 items max or something which you can have on the AH simultaneously. Also prevents the annoying 4 pages of 1 thorium bar before you end up with the stacks.
---
The tower was added in cataclysm?
---
They'll just add some friendliness to their copy-paste reply to automated right click report bans.
---
A trilogy would be nice, and while I love some parts of WotLK, that's the expansion I wouldn't want them to implement fully. Daily quests and LFD were huge in making it a chore, instead of a game. If they brought WotLK as it was at the very end - I'd personally stay in BK.
---
Better to be a noob than to have never started as a newb.
---
Realistically even playing till my eyes bleed i’ll take 2-3 weeks to hit cap. I thought about trying to 1-60 in a play session or two but its highly unlikely - even with routes and shit planned ahead.
---
Yes oh master of the internet who is right about everything.  Your way or the highway obviously.  No one else's views matter.  Go on with your bad self.  
---
The WoW AH: The only place in the world where trickle-down economics may work.
---
So there are two factors, if you want to have the most impact as a healer Priest is your way to go and there is plenty of room for a high skillcap due to 5 second rule (for mana regen) meaning you can’t just spam heal. 
---
If you are looking to be more of a utility healer Shamans are great and always needed but are often considered inferior (assuming same skill players with same gear level) in terms of raw healing output to priests.
---
Not even that late. People are about to find out how not difficult classic/vanilla really was, especially with double the debuffs and 1.12 gear to defeat 1.2 raid bosses.
---
I'm tempted to say 10 days or less, but definitely 15.
---
You also spend mana on shapeshifing, so 5 seconds will start counting only after you change forms.
---
I played on the tail-end of Vanilla  but raided in a hardcore guild for TBC + Wotlk as a Rogue. I plan to make the switch to priest for Classic as well. There will always be a deep desire to be top of the charts in dps meters but I for one am rolling a healer just to try out a totally new component of the game. I assumed I would probably burn out if I try to do a rogue again. I am keeping the memories of my TBC rogue in the vault for good...unless I make an alt :)   
---
Either way the foundation of Classic is going to be pretty basic. A few skill rotations at best but I think priest has more dynamic range then a mage. 
---
PLUS if you hate healing you can always respect to shadow which is a luxury you wont have with your mage if you hate spamming frost bolt. 
---
Yes, mages were overpowered at level 1-2 
---
Standard
---
As someone who played warrior in vanilla and later expansions, you should really really know that warrior in WotLK and beyond is a entirely different experience than warrior in vanilla.  It is a lot harder.  So if you go into it expecting it to feel like what you did in WotLK or later, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise.
---
Tanking is a LOT less optimal in vanilla.  A lot more tab targetting, trying to get aggro on one mob at a time.  You will work harder than in later expansions to make things go smoothly, and get less appreciation for it.  But if that doesn't deter you, warrior is the class for you.
---
Any race is feasible.  Tauren tanks are popular in the min/max culture for the extra 5% hp racial buff, and will of the forsaken for undead can be helpful for breaking fear in the odd situation where you mess up a stance dance.  But I think playing a race you can get into and enjoy supersedes all of that.
---
How were you a Ret Paladin if you didn't spend any talents?
---
That's all anyone wants. Wotlk era loot sharing and right click reporting need to stay in retail. I'm glad we can agree.
---
Didn’t quite realize it at the time, but I was keeping Serpent Sting up on one of my few MC runs.  Didn’t know any better at the time, and I never managed to stumble my way in to a “hey dumbass, here’s what you need to know about raids.”
---
I think I was also thinking I was all that and a bag of chips because I would Aimed Shot rats, potentially inadvertently driving up damage meters if they didn’t disregard critters.
---
I think at one point I also gathered a frost damage set trying to up the frost damage on Hurricane.  
---
You're already playing a deformed version
---
It’s weird you’re pretending I locked it.
---
I’m just pointing out why they *might* have. 
---
As is, yes I can see what you typed. That thread is clickable, and exists as an archived thread.
---
That being said, I guess you didn’t understand me, but I wasn’t saying what *you* typed was the issue. My point was that most responses would be “they fucked up this dungeon” which is just basically negative.  
---
Not me, but my friend (around 10yo at the time) didn't do any quests until around level 30. He just ran around killing mobs and had a blast. 
---
Ahhhh. Makes sense. Thanks! 
---
So the casters use mana, and the non-casters use focus?
---
yes we had, PVE, RP and PVP servers.
---
Nah, some ultra hardcore players like racing to be the first 60, first MC clear, first Ony kill, and I say let them without artificial constraints. 
---
1 week is essentially physically impossible anyway. To get the slower classes to 60 takes about a week of real time, 24/7, powerleveling at a world record pace. I don't care how hardcore your guild is, you're not gonna find 40 people able to go 168 hours without sleep. If people are doing it in 1 week on private servers, the XP numbers are way off or there's an exploit.
---
A handful of guilds might do it in 2 weeks. 99.9% will take at least a month. 
---
It could, painfully.  
---
Being a 13 year old huntard came with a few of these. Bear in mind I started in 2005, not at launch, so some of these might have changed over time.
---
\- Realising I could right click on a pet ability to have it happen automatically. I spammed growl and claw or whatever it's called from the time I got a pet to my mid-20s.
---
\- Getting a new ammo type for the first time as a hunter i.e. upgrading to the next tier of bullets/arrows. You have to manually load the new type into the ammo slot, because of course you do. I bought the new stuff, run out of the old and then was confused for a good few hours on why I couldn't shoot any more. I leveled 16-17 as a melee hunter. 
---
\- Thinking doing /pat on my bear would increase pet happiness. I made a few people laugh with that one.
---
\- Thinking int was my most important stat because then I could spam arcane shot more.
---
\- Advertising that I "could track enemies" as a talent when looking for group. 
---
I personally did this at one point in the past. It does come with two different flavors. 
---
On the one hand, it adds a lot of fresh experiences, especially during the leveling period.
---
On the other hand, it does not give the same, warm nostalgic feeling of home.
---
I found myself at some point (on level 59.8), when there was a chance to join a fresh realm, to start over again in my original faction - home. 
---
For me at least, Vanilla is a lot about going home and I will surely stay there, when Classic releases.
---
I still look back very positively on the vacation / exploration of the other side and will keep them in good memory and at some point might twink their again.
---
However, creating your base there is a big commitment. You will find your new social environment and guild there. You probably won't leave again without hardship. 
---
Eh the state of retail is so bad that there’s nothing to share other than deviantart content
---
I didn't know about green/blue/purple gear, so I was buying the vendor white gear thinking it was the best I could get.
---
Raid healing *is* reactive, but generally speaking I think a skillful range DPS can make the transition just fine. If there's a trick, it's learning to manage mana, prioritize who to heal and when, and *wanting* to do it. 
---
That is an excellent point. Until Level 38, my spec was “Boring”. I was an an extremely Boring Paladin.
---
I prioritize armor on everything over any other stats as a Warlock! 
---
At that point I was 11 years old 
---
The reason I originally went from DPS to Healing back in the day was because I found dps boring in a raid setting and I've never looked back. Fell in love with healing. So based on your response I think you'd enjoy the extra challenge. 
---
People are asking for MoP?!? Did you forget the /s? TBC and WotLK sure, but MoP?!
---
Seems it was Eonar. I still have that character from screenshot.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/eonar/Paskalisko
---
&gt; Do you think people will be accepting of it though?
---
As someone who is rolling a Warrior with 100% intention to tank, I think it would be a nice change of pace during leveling dungeons to let a Bear tank for me while I just spam some cleaves.
---
 And RPPVP where you had EVERYTHING!
---
Absolutely. Do not eat them if they fell down more than 5 seconds ago.
---
Oh wait.
---
Hey, I started out in Eonar!
---
... 
---
Terrible server iirc. Moved to Darkspear at some point in TBC. The only guilds I remember are The Logical Cube and Out of Order. 
---
I'll put time into my professions for once. Attempt to min/max but I know I won't go full hardcore at lvl 60. Just not casual.
---
Wait what’s the difference?
---
Boom roasted 
---
Haha I've noticed that as well. I wasn't being one of the egotistical pricks.. why do I deserve the maps dad?!
---
really? The Tower where you get your first quests in Redridge? Oh man i thought it was there in Vanilla - sorry for the mistake. 
---
Quit being cheap and pay for two accounts. Level the warrior as a main and on your downtime (flying and waiting for people) level your alt.
---
I’ll be maining a holy priest but having a hunter on the other account with herb/skinning. $15/month isn’t Shit to save a ass ton of time.
---
If he told you there would be no point for him to make that mage anymore ;P
---
You took his point and ran to Africa with it. He wasn't suggesting changing the classes as much as making sure the raids are properly adjusted to compensate for the 1.12 talents and mechanics, not changing the way the classes functioned.
---
But I heard a lot about Paladins being viable tanks in 5-man content. Don't understand what you mean when talking logistics? Both classes are among (if not) the slowest leveling classes so not much difference in that. Paladins do get a free mount though!
---
The role I want to immerse myself in would really be the group tanking part. But a Paladin would be able to alternate to a healing role if required so that gives some flexibility. Also, from every poll I've seen there will be a ton of warriors ( a lot will not hit 60 probably, not sure if I will succeed for that matter ).
---
Back in Vanilla I was a Rogue. Pure DPS, zero group utility. :)
---
When I found out in 2005 that add-ons existed when I was level 60
---
WHAT’S UP POTTY PEOPLE
---
Game holds up surprisingly well.
---
I had severe mana problems as a shadow priest. I only learned there was a TIER ONE SHADOW TALENT that solves mana problems when I reached Ungoro. I had taken the stun instead of mana regen. 
---
I remember on my first toon (a Tauren warrior) I was disinterested in the level 10 warrior quest (which gives defensive stance). So I didn’t have that on that character haha
---
I'd even go as far to say: Ok, if you don't roll, I will pay your epic mount. See what they do :D
---
Patch 1.12 already is compensated. 100% of the game data is from 1.12. He's suggesting Mixing 1.12 with 1.8 and 1.4 and 1.3 data.
---
So as a OSRS player way back in its original state there was no such thing as the bond similar to a WoW token in which players can buy membership using their ingame currency. 
---
In OSRS it was weird at first however in time it felt actually pretty good. Being able to use ingame currency to keep your game going felt like an accomplishment and had some real dollar value attached to the time you sunk in.
---
I know a lot of people will freak out and say it is not classic WoW but Bonds were not Old School and really Classic should be looking to Old School and learn from its decisions.
---
Also to any fellow OSRS out there....
---
🦀 TWITTER IS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE🦀
---
Okay then my mind is not tricking me - I was kinda unsure, but I remembered my friend and me to go into cata 2 days after Launch while we used blue items and stuff.
---
They prolly made a raid lock then since MoP and not Cata
---
When I thought I was helping those hunters kill Pridelord. Their rage went to one another to me. I literally logged for like a week because I felt so bad.
---
How u do dat
---
When I was 12 i was playing a tauren hunter and messaging NPCs asking for help, trust me honey, you were not a noob.
---
Just the thought of being a Pally in Tanaris at 37-38 fighting 40-41 mobs.
---
Miss.
---
Dodge.
---
67 (Glancing).
---
..or worse: See it drop and lose to a random undead player.
---
Removing bossabilities or nerfing them because they are "unfun" is the most retail WoW thing in existance. Those bosses have those abilities because of a reason. The only reason the killing of Onyxia was possible with only 3 people was the conflag change. A 40 man raid cleared by 3 people because... let's get rid of this "unfun" mechanic. You can kill Onyxia with 10, maybe 15 fresh 60's if you remove conflag. Is this what you want from classic WoW? Shadowflame on Nefarian? Let's remove this unfun mechanic too. I don't like how i look like when wearing ony cape, so NERF SHADOWFLAME PLZ!   
---
All bosses need prenerf status. (except obvious bugs like ouro or Cthun)
---
leveled to 45 with my rog without poisens. i know there was a quest but i didnt care back than\^\^
---
Stop all dots!
---
I'm pretty interested, as me and my friends play D&amp;D fairly regularly and we would love some higher quality maps.
---
Do you have a website to recommend?
---
What? Huh?
---
Patch 1.12 is not compensated, what are you talking about? Blizzard did not retroactively adjust previous raids with 1.12 changes in mind back in the day, they only looked forward. This is exactly why so many people are happy that DM is not going to be at release.
---
With everything that exists in 1.12 barring no changes, older raids would be significantly easier by the nature of class adjustments making everyone better over time. That's called power creep. Old bosses would need to be tuned with this in mind to get closer to and original experience.
---
Yup. A lot of the human customer service aspects were replaced by automation, unfortunately. That’s probably what allowed them to let go of so many staff in Ireland.
---
I mean i don't call getting a big hard boner losing but to each their own.

---
I thought you were gonna bounce?
---
I'm not sure how you're failing to understand this.  I've never said that you're not allowed to have opinions. I'm saying that if you want people to take your opinions seriously (and not downvote you, which you've complained about) then you need to have more concrete logic backing up your opinions other than "I don't like it, so there." 
---
Example: I can't think of a logical justification for shared loot. You're in favor of shared loot. In order to persuade me and everyone else who shares my opinion, you need to provide a logical argument as to why shared loot is a positive mechanic.
---
These concepts apply to real life too. The internet isn't some special place with different rules on how to have effective discussions.
---
I have basic access to their system for tax purposes. They are responsible for enforcing tax legislation. I’m not a cop lol. 
---
First addon i got was also at lvl 60 when i started raiding
---
21.8 FPS and almost 200ms latency.  Ah, the good ole days.  :P
---
Lawyer? I'm not a lawyer. Even lay people understand backing up an argument with evidence :"D
---
There’s also the Ferelas quest line to get a sprite darter hatching pet. 
---
8/10 for the effort. 3/10 for the result.
---
Oh hey. Glad to see you posting this again for the fifth time, except this time, it's on an alt account!
---
 [1rst](https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0exz0/_/) [2nd](https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0g1r5/_/)
---
[4th](https://www.removeddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0ghkl/mcbwl_bosses_need_to_be_prenerf/)
---
Glad to see you have somewhat of an actual argument this time (omitting the fact that pre-nerf c'thun is impossible and that MC/BWL hardly got nerfed in the first place). Are you sure that you aren't overstating the amount undocumented changes though?
---
Looking forward to the next time you post this!
---
Oh I see. I don't know if I can be a good comparison in that regard since I raid healed in vanilla and then went dps from TBC to Cata. I then went back to healing when me and my friends started playing on vanilla pservers which I enjoyed doing since I had a sense of "nostalgia" to healing.
---
It takes a certain person to heal rather than simply just go for dps and you won't know if you will enjoy it until you try it out. Healing in vanilla is pretty slow and you have to be very mindful of your mana, you need to drink pots in every boss fight pretty much and downrank healing spells as you might already know. There's really not much more to it. Healing rotations will come naturally since you will learn to know when to channel certain heals pretty quick.
---
What happened to me when I went back to healing after \~6 years of dpsing/some tanking in Wotlk, was that I had the urge to cast a flame shock and stuff on bosses to help out when I felt like I had a 1-2 seconds breathing room in a fight. That will probably happen to you aswell since it will basically be an instinct deeply rooted in your mind, but every time you think about it or does it.. slap yourself on the wrist until your brain re-programs itself.
---
But like I said, you might not even enjoy healing since it's slower gameplay than dpsing. So all you can do is to actually level one up to 60 and join a raid as a healer, if you don't enjoy it then roll shadow.
---
Yeah play don't. /R/ wow is fucking retarded
---
They are releasing 1.12 exactly as it was over 10 years ago. That's as perfect as they can make it. That's it.
---
They don't even have the data from before 1.12, so they would be guessing what those values are.
---
What you're suggesting is taking data from many different versions of classic, and mixing it all together with no care of what that would actually do to the game.
---
I’d consider buying the razor naga mouse, so that you don’t have to move your fingers around a lot but instead can click the buttons on the mouse 
---
Data isn't the same as code.
---
Data = whole database (huge) - monsters, hitpoints, loottables, .... Code = the program source code (small) - how the encounters work.
---
They can have data from 1.12 only (understandable), but they surely have the code from as soon as version 1.0. They 100% used version control for their codebase. I'll eat a shoe if they didn't.
---
I was a healer in a top w50+ guild, but i transitioned to dps instead. But beeing a good healer is harder than beeing a good dps. A good healer, has reflexes understands his mana pool and what heal or spell to make in what situation. The way you gear is personal and not from a list, since you might overheal or waste mana more than someone else, or just play diffrently so you need to get a feel for if you need more mp5/spi or +heal.
---
But as a priest, you are healing in 3ways. ( lets talk alliance now, since this is my point of refrence) 1. you are a Holy Priest in a melee group focusing more on group heals and pure raid healing 2. you are disc/holy and healing tanks and topping the raid. (And PI on caster dps)3. you are disc/shadow and your job is applying the SW stacks, while helping out on healing.(And PI on caster dps)
---
You can not say the same thing. Xrealm BG's were in Vanilla. LFD was not in Vanilla.
---
I'll be honest, having experienced every expansion as they came out, I can see why people enjoyed MoP. It wasn't exactly my jam, but it still had interesting, niche abilities that still seemed like an RPG (Symbiosis for Druids, for one). Some classes, like Warlock, played incredibly well.
---
My main expansion so far is still Wrath, but as far as not-Vanilla goes, MoP is in a high spot for me. Was not the biggest Pandaria fan though, ironically.
---
That epiphany I CAN GET RID OF ALL THAT. SHIT WASTED SPACE AND HAVE UNIT FRAMES FROM THIS DECADE and fucking cartographer and bagnon. That 9 hours of UI tweaking was the best day of my life.
---
I always figured newb was just a new(bie) player who hasn't gotten used to the game.
---
And a noob was the guy screaming for heals while standing in a pool of fire and vomit.
---
&gt;\- Advertising that I "could track enemies" as a talent when looking for group.
---
Technically correct, the best kind of correct!
---
That would be true if not for the fact that these farm methods are restricted to three of the classes. Sure, you won't notice a thing... as long as you play the right class.
---
There's a reason _every private server_ nerfs it.
---
How the hell did you not die every single fight.  How slow did you level lol 
---
it’s actually a 93/10 average because 9+3=93
---
What kind of savage is alt-tabbing in 2018 instead of just having a second monitor?
---
Actual WoW Classic VR please... I neeed it.
---
It is but you need to be a newb first to become a noob
---
Give him a break: the place was built within 1 week. If I had to move in that quickly, decorations wouldn't be on my shortlist.
---
Yes, yes! 100 times yes, this needs to be done to as large extent as possible (something can be really lost).
---
We need to upvote this, excellent post, thank you for finding and actually listing all the examples. This could (potentially) be usedul starting point for Blizzard itself.
---
Bet you there were some really confused rogues who tried to gank you. "why the hell does all my attacks get reduced by 60% wtf" 
---
I've already explored the world in previous years of playing. So, I'm going to focus on getting to 60 efficiently and focus on creating a way to have a reliable income. Max mining and actually try to level fishing and cooking this time haha. 
---
Oh and most importantly for myself, NO ALTS UNTIL 60. So many alts...so much wasted time...
---
If their issue is CS time like they've, then flat out say that if we get what we want, then we will get 0 CS support for accidental loot distribution. Fair compromise we make to keep our authenticity.  
---
I wouldn't give a shit either way if loot trading wasn't going to be used to funnel loot in pugs. I know I certainly would be rolling for gear and then passing it to my buddy if he needs it, and I know that I wouldn't want to be the other guy who's having to roll against the group of buddies loot sharing because that's unfair and sucks big D to have your time wasted by loaded dice so to speak.
---
&gt; Removing bossabilities or nerfing them because they are "unfun" is the most retail WoW thing in existance. 
---
It's a GAME at the end of the day. A game absolutely should be FUN. Name calling about retail removes all credibility FYI. Something can be fun and hard without relying on randomness.
---
&gt;Those bosses have those abilities because of a reason.
---
Yeah and they were removed largely for the same reason, Blizzard had very very little experience making "bosses" in this kind of game and made some silly choices.
---
&gt; The only reason the killing of Onyxia was possible with only 3 people was the conflag change.
---
So what you are saying is, the fight was entirely RNG based and actually needed very little skill? Surviving RNG is not skill. It's literally that, RNG.
---
&gt;You can kill Onyxia with 10, maybe 15 fresh 60's if you remove conflag. Is this what you want from classic WoW?
---
No I want it to be hard through actually being hard. Did you even read my post properly or just scan for triggering keywords it in a desperate need to have a fit of rage?
---
&gt;  Shadowflame on Nefarian? Let's remove this unfun mechanic too. I don't like how i look like when wearing ony cape, so NERF SHADOWFLAME PLZ!
---
You're just acting like a complete retard ad nauseam at this point.
---
At what point did I say use different versions of classic? Not once, don't put words into my mouth. Also, mind you, many people have said the same thing regarding private servers, namely Nostalrius. That was the "best" they could make it. Nostalrius used best guess numbers, fancy that. 
---
I am not suggesting using old patch data prior to 1.12. I am suggesting that Blizzard adjust encounters based on what exists in 1.12, like I mentioned before unless you ignored it, for power creep. Adjusting values to preserve the feel of the original game is not the same as guessing what 1.2 values were and running with it. Very different.
---
Yeah, Dwarf is nice for Fear Ward.
---
You'll be able to get the good gear raiding with healing, then switch to Shadow later.
---
Shadow Priests are great in PvP and in 1v1s. They can be major pains in the ass for many classes to deal with.
---
When I dueled good Shadow Priests on my Warrior I stood almost 0% chance of winning.
---
&gt; As one of the better players in my guild, I think I'd be more impactful as a healer...
---
This sentence stood out to me, because it reminded me of myself.  At the risk of sounding a bit narcissistic, I get it... if you're good at video games, sometimes you want to show that off!  I was the same way throughout TBC and Wrath, I took a lot of pride in being the best DPS in my guild.  I liked being known for something I was good at, and I liked feeling like I played a very impactful role to the success of fights.
---
To that end, I have decided to tank in Classic for the same reasons.  I don't have the time to raid, so my gear won't be good enough to be topping DPS meters all the time.  But I *can* be a super-impactful player when it comes to 5/10 mans, and perhaps pug raiding by being the best damn tank I can be.  If feeling like you have an impact is as important to you as it is to me, perhaps tanking or off-tanking is a good role for you to fill.  As a Druid you could potentially even do both off-tanking and healing, depending on your guild!
---
Right in the feels! I talked to a lot of the people who I raided and logged a lot of hours with, and unfortunately almost none of them are going to play Classic. Understandably so as they have families and other commitments now, but not me! Seems I need to find a new tribe!
---
I can see that too. It definitely wasn't horrible. I'd probably rank it after Legion by a pretty large margin. TBC and WotLK being my first and second respectively followed by Legion.. MoP was definitely when I knew I was never going to be addicted to WoW again if they kept going down that path. Note that I skipped the large majority of Cataclysm so I'd probably have found that out a bit sooner if I'd played more of that xpac.
---
Classic WoW is the first time since Wrath that I feel that dangerous brain dump of dopamine every time I think about playing it .. it's dangerous but I've already committed myself to it. There's no stopping this train wreck hahahaha....
---
Yes! I feel like they became abilities later on, such as Spirit Wolves and Hex for Shaman, Bladestorm for Warriors etc. These were iconic abilities from WC3 that easily fit within the theme of WoW and it seemed weird they weren't considered in vanilla, but perhaps they were and just stretched out to provide more content over time.
---
Ya, although I hope to slightly rush to 60 a bit, I may definitely keep cooking on par this time. When I hit 60, I may even do 1-300 fishing in one big boooring go and be done with it. 
---
Only then, the epic mount will be prioritized.
---
If you spent 0 points, you weren't a ret Paladin.  Just a Paladin.
---
Mine was when I figured out what threat was, and that my pet could growl to keep enemies off me.  
---
Why do you think that? Thrash blade will last you all the way to 60 and even at 60 you use it until you score a dal rends or krol blade. 
---
And than what? Use my telepatic powers to let the platform know? We're talking about discussion platforms and how to keep quallity while having an increasing amount of stupid comments.
---
Just like yours.
---
The light is my strength.
---
Do you want to be ahead of the curve, reach server first 60 and server first Rag kill. Then you're screwed. 
---
If you don't care about being first then I would advise the end of September. If the game then comes out in August, no problem. You can create a char, level him a bit in your free time and during your vacation you can still speed run him to 60. You'll still be 60 before most people then.
---
Very true. And very painful.
---
I must have missed the point in 1.12 where I could only raid MC and Ony...
---
Roll Pally, the BEST PvP healer.
---
Perfectly fine for dungeon and world healing and a great support character.
---
Plus they can solo stuff very well with their high armor and healing.
---
Downsides are their seals/buffs can be annoying with short duration and healing can be boring just spamming FoL.
---
/r/unconventionalmaths
---
On the pserver I play on it is.
---
&gt;Did-a-chick?
---
I am doubtful..
---
WTF did I just watch. :D
---
You drew a map of your brain?
---
I believe my strategy involved a lot of bubbling and running away? Which, I mean, ended up being really good practice for PvP. Lol.
---
&gt;OSRS
---
what does this mean?  I keep seeing it, but for the life of me can't figure out what it's an acronym for.
---
I think you can queue the BGs as a group. I'm not sure if it will keep you in group once you get in though, but you can usually get the BG leader to transfer to you or to group you together. That's just a minor nuisance problem.
---
Old School Runescape or 2007 Runescape
---
Thanks for the response.
---
I would be healing leader and unless I’m incredibly worse than expected, I imagine it would be one of our stronger healers. 
---
I’d love to understand more about the first two options — would having better gear sway an ideal role? I’m sure I’ll be grinding 60 dungeons more than rest of guild.
---
I was considering this...but then how would I get my Mottled Red Raptor mount if I'm alliance?
---
No modern judgement affecting design. They've already stated this.
---
Oh I didn't know that, that's cool!
---
Hopefully friendly warlocks will help my alt
---
I remember doing /who's on various filters when the server opened. It was so fun to see 3 people in barrens and none in any other 10+ zone. The entire server population was 1-10. 
---
After a while there were a few rushers who were all alone in duskwood or STV and one person was 10 levels ahead of every other player. 
---
And than what? Use my telepatic powers to let the platform know? We're brainstorming how to keep the quallity of a discussion platform while having an increacing amount of stupid comments.
---
Your comment is prove the 4chan method doesn't work for discussions.
---
Perhaps you could articulate why you think a comment is stupid instead of utilizing a hive mind button that hides any content that goes against popular opinion.
---
Dipshit.
---
Exactly as viable as it was the last time someone asked this question. Which is exactly as viable as it was the time before that, or the time before that.
---
Can't raid Hogger with starter zone sharding.
---
&gt; I am suggesting that Blizzard adjust encounters based on what exists in 1.12
---
Oh, that's way worse than I thought. You want them to make up their own data... Yeah, it won't be classic anymore. No thank you.
---
Well you don't need to think of a logical justification.  Blizzard has given you THEIR justification, which is that they laid off a bunch of CS and don't want to hire more and don't want to deal with loot tickets.
---
In the end, Blizzard's argument is the only argument lol.  
---
...and boy are you naive about the internet.  It's literally a place where anything can happen despite what "rules" you think apply to your life.
---
&gt;not zoomed out max distance at all times
---
Noob.
---
well as on all other classes gear makes you better in all aspects, you can downrank more effectivly, get more heals out before oom etc.
---
But as to gearing your "priests" all of you need or want more or less the same items. As a "role 1" you might want more +heal and spi since you know that you are getting an innervate. as a "role 2" you might feel you need more mana/mp5. but all these things with what you need, is something you feel when you are raid healing.
---
I'm curious what mobs you plan to grind at various levels, particularly any that you see as being especially efficient whether its due to some combination of low hp, armor, and weak attacks.
---
Unrealistic, stick to having your first character as your farming alt for your Warrior and then maybe consider another alt later on once you have fully furinished those two at 60.
---
Having more than two characters actually geared is unlikely, since you actually have to attend raids on your characters, and actually spend months upon months grinding honor on each one. Raid-logging happens and you level alts, just like we did back in retail - but there is a limit on raid schedules and required time to farm or grind items.
---
If you level your Hunter up and then suddenly want to bring another class to raids after gearing them up... prepare for salt. I remember numerous people who switched mains and the only ones who were greeted warmly were the ones who did it when TBC came out, since it feels like a bit of a waste to everyone in the raids when you stop bringing that character. Just a warning - might not be as easy as you think to just drop a character they helped you gear up. 
---
My guild in retail had a couple people who tried doing things like this and it always soured at least a few people in the guild.
---
Sounds like you mostly want to commit to a Warlock longterm, so just make your Warlock first and then pimp your Warrior with your lock. You can always make your third/fourth characters and play around with them as your two 60's are chugging away.
---
If you've played on any private server you are a massive hypocrite. The game they're making already isn't classic. It can never be. Unless they following every single patch from release exactly as it was, it will never be classic.
---
They weren't banned for ninja looting.  Could have been related, like harassment over loot or maybe going against agreed upon loot rules.  An asshole is an asshole.
---
Look at the stats on loot for most of vanilla, Blizz themselves didn't know who needed what.  They weren't banning people for needing shit that another class could put to better use.
---
Any explanation why?
---
You're creating drama and flame stuff that won't make a difference, except for less work for GMs. Thankfully this is up to Blizzard, I'm happy with that we're getting the game and how the game plan is right now. If there's loot trading and right click report, that'll just make life easier =)
---
I started as a dwarf huntard who didn't realize you could only have one type of sting on a Target at a time, I spent most of my early leveling shooting every sting I had at a Target every fight
---
I didn't understand party etiquette, so I rolled need on everything.  I didn't know it was bad to be called a ninja--I thought they were complimenting my ninja-like roll skills
---
Classic exploration is my main teason for going back to WoW
---
Tanking was very much on my radar as an option, but an equally skilled player in my guild is also interested in it, as well as the GM. I’m not a big fan of playing in melee (and spending the fight staring at a giant leg), so I’m content to let them run with the tank role.
---
I’ve spent my life in WoW flexing my damage meter output and riding my ego, but for Vanilla, I just want to kill KT. That’s my sole goal. And I’m just guessing a little extra DPS won’t be as impactful as a good healer, especially in a 40-man.
---
I've never played on a private server, even if I did, wanting official classic wow to be the real 1.12 data doesn't make them a hypocrite.
---
&gt; Unless they following every single patch from release exactly as it was, it will never be classic.
---
Don't play it then. See ya.
---
I've played Alliance all my life. But recently I've realized that Alliance are in fact the oppressors. So I plan to go Horde without looking back. Westfall was my main nostalgia zone so I took care of that in the demo :p
---
The only thing holding me back is that I fear I've grown waaaay dependent on shadowmeld. Someone tell me it's gonna be okay!! That I'm not gonna get ganked while drinking!! Please!!
---
The mountains next to Stormwind. The vieuw of the city is real good from there.

Same for the mountains around Orgrimmar.

Way back in the day when I started playing online games, "newbie" was the term for legitimately new players.  Of course, l337-sp34k took it's hold on that, so "new-bie" became abbreviated to "newB" in which you were still supposed to pronounced the "B" as a letter (so it sounded like newbie).  But then people lost site of that, and started pronouncing it like "noob," and then that spelling took hold.
---
IMO I still distinguish between newbie and noob.  Everyone was a newbie at some point.
---
What I remember is 'Normal' 'PvP' 'RPPVP' - Normal being you're not flagged in contested territory, you did get flagged in Horde/Ally controlled places though if I remember correct. Such as Orgrimmar if you're alliance.
---
PvP speaks for itself, and RPPVP aswell.
---
Chug Stoneshield pots for armor. Can still pop defensive CDs a bear doesn't have access to like Shield Wall, Last Stand, Lifegiving Gem. Can push more threat than a bear druid if they want to pop their offensive cds. Has a number of utility abilities such as interrupts, intercept, disarm, taunt, challenging shout, mocking blow. Can always throw on a shield in a pinch and use shield block. If you are worried about getting crushed, just put on a shield. Bears don't have the same flexibility.

I was level 60 with full tier 0.
---
I'm sorry, but are incredibly dense. The point about private servers is that all values they had we're best guesses. Meaning it was not completely accurate. So had you been someone that played them, suggesting everything must be pristine while also claiming private servers got it "right" would make that person a hypocrite.
---
I'm refraining from making any attacks at you. But seriously? What did I say that suggested I had issues enough warranting me not wanting to play. Stating a fact doesn't mean I can't still enjoy something.
---
post 2. As a classleader, or healing officer it is your job to make sure and know what your other healers/players are missing and needs, you are aware of others playstyle, and their gear.
---
But at the sametime, beeing fair and make sure that loot is revarded equally to make the guild progress better. 
---
As a "Classleader", Gear is a tool for guild progress more than a reward. Everyone needs to be able to be on the same "level" kind of like weakest chain.
---
Honestly, 90% of guilds won't need a DW fury warrior. 
---
New favorite (not sure when it was introduced) is the room in Org to celebrate the developer who passed away
---
I wish I had my old screenshots. They got lost in a hard drive crash. :(
---
exactly what me and my guildies are planning
---
rush to 60 asap and gank and camp everyone in dustwallow marsh and redridge mountain to make sure the allies dont level up
---
our goal is not fair pvp .. its total annihilation of the alliance on the server .. and for that you need to gank the young ones to make sure they start on another server. lvl 60s dont reroll any more but we also plan to make their raid evenings as terrible and delayed as it can be 
---
I don't know what pserver you play on but the one I was playing on a year ago had those working. Lava eruption is the periodical raid damage and definitely happens on pservers.
---
This is high skilled gameplay. Be proud.
---
Low effort? I haven’t made any and I take offense to that. 
---
I remember a quest where I had to run back and forth from Astranar up to Auberdine several times. By the end my finger was getting tired from holding down w continuously for 30 minutes or whatever it took. It was only at the end that I started looking in the hotkeys.  Behold, the joy that is autorun.
---
That makes sense.  Were I in your shoes, I'd probably lean towards Druid.  I don't think I'd want a class that could *only* heal, and the versatility of maybe mixing it up for 5/10 mans or farm raids would pull me towards Druid or maybe Shaman with the 30/0/21 PvE / PvP hybrid spec.
---
When i first started as a young pleb i thought 'bind on equip' on gear meant that i would be permanently stuck with the gear equipped. I didnt want to run around at 60 with level 15 greens so i would only use gray items.
---
Do you have any source for your statement about "Armor reduction is capped at 75% in Vanilla?"  
---
How do you know this?  
---
Also, the main reason druids pump more threat on private servers is crowd pummelers, not some bullshit about armor reduction. Armor reduction being incorrect should be an equal buff to both warriors and druids, not something that makes druids come out on top.
---
Old Ironforge or getting below Stormwind comes instantly to my mind.
---
It's such a stupid idea too, "let's put the bugs blizz removed back into the game". 
---
So stupid it's probably a troll doing a '#nochanges' bit.
---
I find myself disinclined to be social on retail. Like, I try to do it, but since the game practically pushes us away from it...it just feels too forced and inorganic and unattractive. Guild interactions are still great when i find one worth the time, but thats about it.
---
Put me on a private server though...man. It is so essential to the experience. I was worried that spark had gone away, that I had become boring or a factor in the descent of WoW into an MSORPG, but no...it feels just as good as ever. Probably better, since 12 year old me was socially inept, whereas now I can actually speak with purpose. 
---
Oh god that Wintersaber Trainers faction grind for the mount...and Frostsaber Provisions aren't a 100% drop.
---
Also, if I am not mistaken, that mount is Alliance only.
---
As a paladin, I've got a route that prioritizes undead / demon grinding locations from 20-60, with a handful of levels here and there with normal mobs. Undead / Demon gives me high damage ranged pull with exorcism which gives lower downtime for grinding.
---
I do prioritize looking for low armor mobs, but there aren't really many good resources to find them. Some classic databases show armor value, but the data is missing for some mobs. I doubt the [zanzil zombie](http://classicdb.ch/?npc=1488) has 0 armor.
---
But since, given previous math, I can technically sustain 2.5 - 3 kills a minute (damage and mana wise) even with normal armor value mobs, it's not too much of a concern of mine. The 2KPM rate I can consider a baseline.

O please, if you assume someone is talking about 20 mans when they say 8-10 healers, then you are dumb as bricks. The 40 mans are the main events in Vanilla, not the 20 mans. Obviously we know there are 20 mans in this game. But why would you assume people are talking about 20 mans in this context? You are just covering up your stupidity.
---
Stranger things have happened. Square lost all of FF7's original assets because they had to make space for FF8 development. That was back when storage wasn't as cheap. Not saying that happened to WoW.. just saying sometimes shit happens.

We're talking about IF a comment is stupid and how a platform could handle it to keep the quallity of the discusion high.

Not WHY a comment is stupid. You should indeed use your brain for that.

But if you want to know. Comment that does not contribute to the discussion because someone didn't understood it was a discussion is the first place. Is in my oppiniom a stupid comment. Also comments with to much salt are both funny and stupid.

Bringing your main and friends to kill gankers in Barrens was one of the great joys of Classic wow
---
Hey guys, so i am considering Mage / Druid, but still i am open for nearly everything except shaman. 
---
I will mostly play PvP (Bg's), maybe casual PvE at the beginning and later some more depending on many things (mostly time), i was a hardcore pvp'er all the way before and was progress raiding in wotlk/cata, so i could feel comfortable doing both again. I am very focused towards my goals and would want a class with a great skill cap. 
---
I played druid throughout all expansions mostly as heal, mage not really that much. I love druids for the versatile style and many speccs that i could play, i have no problem to tank/heal/dps whatever is needed and will feel comfortable doing all of that. My biggest fear on druid so far is that i will be thinking all of the time maybe i should have chosen another class since i will get bored from it, even with much more to master than in the latest state of the game. 
---
Also my friends will mostly play cloth classes so druid would be good for the loot i guess.
---
Mage well yeah i really like the playstyle of frost in vanilla, fire not that much tbh so i wouldnt even know if i could play it's full potential since i dislike some parts. Biggest downside would be i share the loot with friends. I would just love to try it out and have something more new than all the main classes i had before.
---
The one other class i would consider is Hunter which i played on and off before but not really too much, but to be fair i don't really know the playstyle of hunter in vanilla i only started him in wotlk.
---
So yeah encouragement to pick druid is welcome or other suggestions which playstyle could be fitting for me. 
---
Yea, I was considering Shaman a bit if I go horde, but the min-maxed in me wants to push myself to be the best healer I can be if I go that direction. If I go Priest, it’s because I want to be awesome at it, help carry the raid and top HPS meters.
---
It's a good idea! 
---
I rolled the opposite faction (Alliance) on my first private server and it makes everything new and fresh! 
---
I really should a second monitor in the same size as my main monitor. But I dont need a big second monitor.. I could use a bigger mainscreen tho... I think I have to buy 2 new monitors.....
---
Nice wallpaper.
---
"I will be shocked if you see main tanks not trying their darndest to get to 440 as reasonably as they can. The math of it is just too critical for fights. "  
---
Then does no actual math, just talks about how defense works and claims patchwerk will crit a tank for 16k lol.   
---
R/wow's toxicity has also driven a large amount of the regular users away
---
Bounce on your oom bum bum
---
Oh yeah I don't think it breaks progression. The added items do that. The changed items will have a minor impact vs the added ones. 
---
Seeing as I want to play a classic Paladin, I am going to have to switch factions this time around (was a Shaman in vanilla)...lol
---
I don't think this is necessarily a problem. Reddit isnt a message board where we should only have serious discussions all the time, its a platform for sharing content. Eventually people will talk about whatever they talk about, those threads will die out due to karma decay. 
---
This is typical for off seasons of TV shows, or during luls of content in other games. 
---
How'd it work?  I haven't played vanilla in over 10 years.
---
Yeah, me and my friends spent an entire weekend jumping around trying to find spots to wall climb once. We climbed the waterfall in Orgrimmar, the mountains infront of Orgrimmar (behind the pig farm) and with our 19 twinks in WSG.
---
Good times
---
I didn't the first week in the starter zone
---
Those posts are better than the daily "Should I go this race/class or that one???" posts

&gt; I'm refraining from making any attacks at you.

No you're not. You've been attacking me personaly this whole time.
---
It's not launch day Classic, Its arguably Classic circa 2006 without certain items/content available. 
---
Well i got my start on a private server just after BC dropped but I was really bad. Most of these things I didn't realize I was doing wrong until far far FAR later. Like after i started playing retail later. 
---
* As a Huntard I would jump in and out of melee range to use raptor strike because I thought "It looks cool"
---
* Because of my focus on melee I would choose weapons with high melee strike max damage.
---
* This except as a mage
---
* actually as a mage I used to focus on instant cast spells exclusively. I thought cast times were boring and dumb so I would run into a mob cast arc exp, combustion, frost nova over and over again while using my auto attack to get in some melee.
---
* Put every single talent in Feral as a druid, No balance, no resto
---
* \^That was during cataclysm.
---
I didn't know that you had to type /1 to talk in general chat until at least after I'd been in Desolace. I'd been responding to stuff in general chat with the default, which is /s, and had been talking there.
---
I was an elemental shaman, but in the beginning the only stat I went for was armor. A friend told me that I should focus more on intellect, and the result was I started focusing ONLY on intellect, which lead to me wearing nothing but cloth. 
---
I was still wearing much cloth, although I think I'd started to look for mail, when I was asked to tank in Uldaman. The healer quickly wanted a different tank, but I tanked a few pulls at the beginning wearing mostly cloth.
---
I've thought about it too, as I was horde only...but then I have this debate in my head about whether I want it to be nostalgic or new...I think I want it to be nostalgic plus I only got to level 40-50ish.
---
Hyjal, of course! I remember finally making into that zone and seeing it show up in big letters across the screen. I remember such a bizarre feeling being the only person in that entire zone, feeling like the first person to discover uncharted territory. Of course I wasn’t the first person, but you know what I mean, that magical feeling like you’re actually discovering a new world that wasn’t meant to be discovered.

I think only abilities that cost mana will stop your mana regeneration. So the shapeshift will stop it but you will start again after 5 seconds even if youre using abilities in bear or cat form.

If you're missing your swings due to lack of +%  hit and duel weilding, it doesn't matter what you have in your hands. Better off with a 2h until you get some +hit. 
---
I was a pretty high ranking hunter in WOTLK, CATA, and the start of BFA.
---
On a pserver I raided as a resto druid in MC (both swiftmend and regrowth specs) and tbh it was insanely boring compared to dps. This may be due to early scaling issues with resto druids but as a role I really found it lackluster. This is just my opinion but if you've literally only ever played mage, I really can't see you enjoying vanilla healing. Mana is a bitch if your guild is decent and chain pulls, heal sniping is annoying as hell, you literally spam 1 spell, you're forced to play dwarf if Alliance. 
---
Some of the pros are you get into groups easier, you spend less on consumes, your numbers aren't as harshly critiqued, and its generally easier to gear.
---
Obviously this is just my opinion playing a sub-optimal healing class in the first raid tier. But to me you sound like someone who would really enjoy mage or any other strong dps. A good dps is equally, if not more important than a good healer in vanilla, so I wouldn't worry about feeling like you aren't contributing enough.
---
It wasnt vanilla / classic related apparently. I think they are too sensitive, if you even MENTION something outside of vanilla / classic, but in this case i was more intrested in the vanilla version of the dungeons, not the revamped versions =/ 
---
why?
---
Exactly, by that very nature it's drastically different. My server in Vanilla by that point was pugging MC, Oly and BWL because it was very easy by that time.  They may not have been super difficult to begin with, but the values in 1.12 sure don't help.
---
Here's the difference. /r/wow is such a shit game, the subreddit only posts memes, cosplays, and art. /r/classicwow is unreleased. Let people post as they please until the game comes out. If memes and art become a problem at that time, maybe this sub will create a rule for it.
---
You do know you can make more than one character on an account, right?
---
Square Enix lost the source code to Final Fantasy 8 and Kingdom Hearts, and were much much bigger than Blizzard during that era. 
---
I'm not sure if Blizzard has ever lost code before, but they for sure lost the original renders for the units for Starcraft. 
---
I have my spots, plus herbing/mining. Then once DM is released I’ll be living there. 
---
Till Level ~30 i didnt eat and drink at the same time (seems logic for me xD)
---
And Level ~40 i found out there are blue items came from strange things like dungeons. Dude this blew my mind 
---
Lol you reminded me when some random guy ran up to me and asked me if I was a Chinese farmer and I was like... no why? And then he dragged me to SM for my first dungeon because I was rocking all green garbage 
---
The only issue with druid tanks is that they have less "oh shit" buttons (Shield Wall, Last Stand) and are vulnerable to being crit/crushed in raids. I haven't seen anyone have any issue with druid tanks while leveling. They're not gimped by mana like Paladins and better for dungeons than warriors for the most part.
---
Yeah you save healing gear, priests and druids do it also. at one point you will be asked " - Can you heal "
---
&gt;rush to 60 asap and gank and camp everyone in dustwallow marsh and redridge mountain to make sure the allies dont level up
---
This is what my group will be doing as well.
---
Thank Christ there are other people with the mentality of "ITS US VS THEM"
---
The entire premise of the game imo is the rivalry and warfare between the horde and alliance.  If you can prevent the other faction form progressing in PvE (killing them as they are entering raids to prevent raid buffs, kill quest NPC's to stop them form leveling, etc) you and your faction is winning. 
---
The more you suppress and gank the other faction, the easier time YOUR faction will have leveling, collecting resources, etc.
---
If they are not fight backing, attack the main cities.
---
God Speed you glorious bastards (if you're NA, Hit me up on what server -- I have about 15 or so RL buddies looking to do the same)
---
Ha! Thanks for the enlightenment :)
---
That's pretty silly honestly. It would have given people who aren't familiar with vanilla an idea of when things changed/what they used to be like.
---
I don't envy the mods' job and generally respect them, but damn if some don't have poor judgement.
---
Priest were op
---
I’m considering two boxing. It would slow my leveling speed down but might end up saving time in the long run. 
---
I love triggering people online. 
---
You’ll not find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. 
---
&gt; That thing that you need to do outside the instance (multiple of those) will result in the desync i mentioned.
---
Right, but you can do that after the BRD run is finished. That would, of course, imply that each player is considering the needs of the group as well as his own.
---
They kind of did at launch, they were super broken and had to be nerfed multiple times if I recall. A blood DK in PvP was basically an elite mob that required 3 people to reliably kill.
---
did that druid have like 1800 hp?! lol wat
---
Yes, that is the difference.
---
Newbie = greenhorn
---
Noob = bad player who never got better

Okay we don't need work in progress updates on all your maps. It just comes off as karma farming now.

If dungeon bosses will be pre-nerf then allow 40 people to zone in like the olden days.
---
The website is called Inkarnate, I've used it to make maps in the past for my D&amp;D group.
---
It's way too easy for a Vanilla Vet to talk about Vanilla.  There was so much charm, so many good memories, a concrete server community.  I could come up with 100 thread titles off the top of my head. Retail has been the same homogenized garbage for the past 3 xpacs.  There's nothing to talk about it because any new content is just the same regurgitated shit.
---
Let's get one of Westfall
---
These are really cook I really like it! Never heard of Inkarnate service but it looks really awesome.
---
I agree! Good points. There is absolutely no reason to release it end of summer
---
The baron rivendare mount is a 1/5000 drop chance in vanilla.
---
that means if you run it at a realistic rate of say 2 times an hour and 8 hours a day for a whole year (5840 runs) you would still only have about a ~70% chance of seeing it ONLY DROP. Now you have to factor in that you have to roll against a group of five to receive it. So your chance has gone from 1/5000 to 1/25000. After this your chance after a whole year is about ~20% of seeing it and winning it.
---
That’s with a group that wants to run it as much as you, not factoring having to return to major cities and recruit new group mates, and if you have no warlock, you have to flight master travel all the way back. 
---
I mean they dont HAVE to do anything. The options are
---
1. Do vanilla and no OSRS no xpacs, no wiping and recycling- it just progresses to Naxx and sits there forever 
---
This requires the least amount of work, but would eventually turn the servers into ghost towns that they are paying to maintain for nothing.
---
2. Do Vanilla, the server makes it to Naxx, and then they just keep redoing vanilla servers
---
This requires almost as little work as option 1, but would refresh the server pops. Eventually though people would move on.
---
3. Do vanilla and have OSRS type content. This requires a TON of investment on their end for likely very little pay off. Again, the only way to do this is to either trivialize Naxx or make content that only Naxx raiders can access. It would also screw with their current retail continuity so not likely
---
4. Do vanilla, then every expansion up to current retail. Literally nobody is asking for this. The game fundamentally changes in Cata and player numbers would drop off a cliff...just like they did in 2010. Why would this HAVE to be what they do if they do TBC &amp; Wotlk when they could do the next option instead:
---
5.Do Vanilla, and then 2 years later do TBC. Then 2 years later do Wotlk. Then reset the whole thing and start back at Vanilla and let people do the whole thing all over again.
---
This would cost significantly less than an OSRS type option, would likely result in quite a large jump in subs (given that these 2 expansions are when the sub numbers hit their peak) and by the time wotlk finishes players would want to jump back in and play vanilla again.
---
You will probably be asked to try all 3 roles, so hang on to every bit of gear that might help. Cloth pieces are fine if the healing stats are there. 
---
Looks about as cool as all the other ones
---
Save it and have a way easier time finding groups.
---
Orc Warlock or Gnome Warlock? I can't decide between the 2. I like a mixture of PvP / PvE. Orc have the stun resist but Escape Artist and the 5% int is very good too. Especially as gear progress with more int.
---
It sucks to deal with Undead Will of the Forsaken but it also sucks going against Paladins. 
---
I hope so.. as long as its not august
---
Unfortunately I had max level chars in both factions and was raiding in both factions so there are no surprises left for me. Will play horde as I want to be a male druid without losing my pride by playing a night elf. ^For the horde :-)^
---
level 38... holy shit dude lol 
---
PvE, PvP, RPPvE, RPPvP.
---
Got level 60 on my warrior before I did the warrior quest to get my berserker stance. 
---
Someone told me to fear adds in uldaman so I typed /fear. In combat. 
---
While dueling in durotar another warrior taught me what hamstring did. At level 60. 
---
Ret is fine for leveling dungeons both as DPS and healer, but you're most likely going to heal simply because healers are scarce and you can do it.
---
Yea I just scroll past stuff I don't like, but its good to have a variety of stuff to talk about. With r/WoW you're either posting fluff, complaining or complaining about the complainers. It's a wonder what you expect people to post if they can't throw up stuff showing their fandom or giving their views/criticisms on what they're a fan of. It's like people want to discuss the game but only with people they agree with. 
---
what if they release it after classic comes out? im certainly not gonna play it then
---
Tauren are so much fun to RP. You get to joke about hooves and ask people to milk you. You can talk about other races being so small “not much bigger than a gnome”. You can ask a blacksmith to sharpen your horns. And, the /silly emotes are too notch (though Tauren /dance sucks). 
---
I don't think GMs act like robots, they've all been wholesome to me.
---
Regardless, my understanding is that GM tools don't have that functionality anymore. The only time a GM would need to enter the game world is to log into a character for technical issues. 
---
That's 9 more minutes than I'm willing to spend. 
---
I love me some drum n bass. Puts me in relaxed, focus mode 
---
You do realise most (if not all) of those changes were made in the database, not the code, right? 
---
Got to level 22 on my hunter without knowing there was a class trainer, this also meant no pet. 
---
Sure players could petition a GM to have loot given to another player. But it was up to the GMs discretion, it was extremely rare to see ANY loot reassigned, and players weren't using this to screw other players over regularly on loot.
---
You said if it happens enough from the same guild they'll develop a reputation on the server...but how would anyone even know they were loot trading at all without everyone in the group somehow being shown that the gear or item was traded? Having a piece of in game mail alert all the players in the party that the item was traded and between which players would allow the community to be aware and for them to develop said poor reputation. 
---
This is one of my favorite songs! I remember my cousins showing this to me back in the day. I listen to it all the time and have memorized all the words. Classic... 
---
It’s really unfortunate. Sure it wouldn’t have been balanced, but I really wish there were more flavor abilities based on WC3 units and heroes that differentiate the different race/class combos more. Race specific weapons like glaives for NE, totems for Tauren, and throwing spears for Trolls would have been awesome as well, but it would have been a lot more work to implement.
---
I remember being hacked in BC, all of my gear and items in my bag were sold and I was left with a half naked undead rogue wearing only a couple pieces of soulbound unvendorable gear.  I was super freaked out, I couldn't even get on my account, I made a starter edition account to petition a GM.
---
About 10 minutes later one answered, and teleported me to a weird little tower and talked to me.  Did some theatrical "Let me see here..."s and conjured up some random spell effects, and a mailbox.  All of my gear was there waiting for me.  I had never felt such a sense of relief.  Any interaction with GMs ever since have been automated copypasta responses that never really fulfill my requests.  I miss CSRs that actually played the game, and actually wanted to help.
---
Did you stop reading at the first comma?
---
It is astronomically unlikely that you're going to end up in a shard with the same people, which means you won't run into people you remember from before, who remember you, which allows you to form friendships. Recognizing people is kind of what gets that whole "community" ball rolling.
---
Sharding up to lvl 10 is probably inevitable at this point but it absolutely shouldn't be in the 10-20 zones.
---
I disagree, I can't speak for OSRS, but Classic WoW, acquiring gold as a means for progression is a big part of the game. Buying skills and getting epic riding is a big achievement. I don't think OSRS has those rite of passages. 
---
There were oversights, design flaws and bad decisions made throughout Vanilla that were corrected by 1.12, this includes boss encounters and dungeon design. If people are really pushing for code from before 1.12, why stop at changing 1.12 NPC spells/stats when player spells/stats went through buffs and nerfs as well? An example would be the nerfs to rogue/warrior instant-attack abilities in patch 1.8 where they changed how the bonus attack power was calculated, or the 1.4 change where they added in a GCD whenever you changed weapons.
---
If we're going for a fully authentic Vanilla experience then I remember when environmental damage didn't break stealth and there weren't any city patrols with stealth detection.
---
The problem with r/wow is the mods, they'll delete completely relevant threads and tell people "this should've been posted in this megathread that was stickied 3 weeks ago"
---
Lets hope that is not a thing again.
---
accuria is like priority for tanks, +hit is hard to get as a tank, any guild NOT giving these to tanks first is pretty dumb
---
I don't think they'll go out of their to enforce it. They currently dont do that for cross gold trading on retail, as my understanding. 
---
It'll probably be offset by risk, as Blizzard can say "We're not going to do anything if you get screwed."
---
The only time I’ve seen a Druid tank struggle was the optional Hakkar event in ST. But that was probably due to level, difficulty of the fight, and honestly I don’t think he was swiping -.-
---
If it's so easy lets see your channel
---
the circlejerking about tips on this sub is just retarded 
---
Did you just miss the whole destruction of most of the support staff? We are getting automated to death lol.
---
Too long, didn‘t read. But wtf just play the game and do what‘s fun to you. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Classic will share the GM's with retail so there's no way they will have time to even write fun messages.
---
Honest question, how old are you?
---
There was no competition for server first because it was just based on getting douses (which means people had 20 man raids at attunement isle which means bigger guild wins), everyone had complete full prebis  which meant everyone cleared it without any issues. It's a lot more fun to try clear MC with as little as possible, that makes it an actual difficult challenge, and honestly i don't see why someone no lifing to clear week 2 ony/mc shouldn't be rewarded with more loot. 
---
I remember thinking that the Deeprun Tram was locked until you discovered both cities (like a flight path) and so I tried several times as a level 10-20 to run to Ironforge through the Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge. Needless to say I never made it.
---
The most noble of paladin abilities!
---
Anyone can steal the egg once the quest is complete, and you can do it any number of times.  So as horde you can just wait around for someone else to do it or have an alliance friend do it for you.
---
crYYYY
---
No they will not.
---
The better the guild is, the bigger is the overlap between fury and tank gear. (Up to the point where it becomes hard to see the difference). Especially on horde side. 
---
But usually guilds of higher quality work towards the optimization of the raid performance as a whole thing instead of personal loot wishes and you will get DPS gear if you need it, and fury warriors will be fine with it because they understand decisions like that.
---
&gt; Also worried I might not enjoy it as much if I lose the competitive nature of competing on meters (though I know HPS meters have similar competition)
---
If you derive your enjoyment during raids from competing with your peers, you probably will not enjoy healing as much as dpsing. HPS meters are useful for identifying weak links and WHY they aren't performing as well for coaching reasons, but they are a very, very bad metric for determining who is the "best" or most impactful healer. In that way HPS meters should be interpreted much differently from DPS meters.
---
For instance, druids typically have the lowest output but are arguably the best at saving someone from a sudden massive damage spike with NS+Regrowth+hardcasted Regrowths because of its ridiculously high crit chance from talents. Swiftmend, if talented, gives them even more burst healing. They can easily prevent a wipe with good reaction time, but meters don't show this. This is not to mention other things like brez on another healer, a dps who got gibbed on a progression fight, an offtank, etc. 
---
Shamans have their totems as well which are unquestionably extremely valuable. They're good healers too, but they don't really shine on meters outside of fights where people are clumped or melee takes a lot of unavoidable damage just because of how their healing kit works. 
---
I could go on and on about this but there are so many aspects of being a healer in general, irrespective of class, that simply cannot be captured in meters despite their value. With DPS, meters are a perfectly relevant metric to derive value because the the most important job of a DPS is to do as much damage as possible, whereas the job of a healer is to enable the DPS to do as much damage as possible (which includes keeping the tank alive). 
---
I kind of rambled on a bit, but that was a really long way of saying it's hard to be a good healer if you focus on competing on the healing meters. That's not to say topping healing meters and being a good healer are mutually exclusive, but they do not necessarily go hand-in-hand either. 
---
Yes it works 
---
Back then I was convinced that the white armor sold
---
by vendors would be better that the green armor from quest rewards. So every 5-10ish levels my stupid 14 year old me would proceed to sell all its armor and weapons and buy a full set of white shit directly from the vendor. Needlessly to say I did not have the gold to buy the lvl40 mount.
---
Lmao this time around probably the music of the game or nothing. Then? Nu metal, and rap lmao
---
Wow someone's salty that people don't like his favorite YouTube channel.
---
In what regards does age make a difference in an anonymous forum? Any disagreement that comes down to "age" never ends with anything constructive.
---
Noiceee
---
Hey guys, I thought you might like to watch my latest discussion video. Coming off the back of the recent blue post on the planned changes to the patch release schedule, what I thought was most interesting is that the classic wow development team are clearly a different culture form the retail team. We have their attention. Let's make the most of it.
---
&gt;But wtf just play the game and do what‘s fun to you.
---
That's **literally** what I'm doing here.
---
I started 6 months or so before BC came out. It was 3 friends and myself. They all ended up as humans, and I rolled a druid. We wanted to level together, so I had Google'd a guide on how to get there, and ran to meet up with them. Needless to say this ment I didn't get my class quests for my forms. I wanted to be feral and was putting my talents into feral, prepping for when I'd finally get my forms. Lol I was around level 45 with my friends, when we grouped with a rando for a dungeon, and he had his cat form. I was like, wtf?! That's when we told me about what I needed to do, and was even nice enough to show me where to go. Plus, none of us knew that we had to keep training for our abilities. The last time we had bought new training was around level 10ish? Needless to say, questing and fights became WAY less difficult. We felt like golden gods after getting all our training and abilities! It was like a whole other game!
---
There were many "Oh my God"s during classic but the one I remember the most was inside the scarlet red monastery. I played a night elf rogue at that time and she was the first to even reach this level. Haven't played a lot with other people till then so I hardly knew the other classes.  We defeated the boss of the library and he droped his dagger. Of course I rolled need, together with the warlock. The warlock won and I was realy mad. A dagger? For a warlock? 16 years old me got pissed and started to rage. Took them about ten minutes to explain me, why a dagger with intelligence may be not the best for me. 
---
That may not be the biggest fault, but it got stuck in my mind. The group was realy friendly and even invited me to join their guild. I did so, learned a lot and even got a nice sword for my combat spec. So be nice to other people and nice things may happen to you. 
---
I only discover approx. level 20 that you can repair the equipment instead of deleting it.
---
Caverns of Time, southern Silithus before AQ was put in and it was just rows and rows of obelisks, under SW, behind the portal in Deadmines with all the Outlands stuff.  Exploration was one of my favorite things in vanilla.
---
This hasn't been a constructive chain ever since you started posting.
---
"Ooh, a map!" *Hits upvote arrow*
---
Seriously, who does this?
---
If you're going for enchanting just for wands: don't. Enchanting is not a great money maker unless you plan on keeping it, getting all the high-end recipes and spamming trade chat a lot. I'm only going Enchanting at first to get my Druid BiS tank trinket during MC, then swapping out immediately. 
---
You'd be *way* better off making money with Skinning/Herb or Skinning/Mining. Hell, even a gathering profession and tailoring to make and sell bags. You can trade these out at 60 once/if you have access to farming opportunities. 
---
Not me. I had shit computer back then. I could explore and level. Now I have a beast compared to that. It's time for me to experience the fastest WoW and best looking I've played
---
Always take thrash on warrior
---
This isn’t even a debate 
---
You can go tailor/skin and have an alt for disenchanting. The only DE that you would miss out on are BoPs. 
---
STACK FOR SURGER!
---
I'm just sad that there was no bloodlust in WoW vanilla.
---
I always love it when Grubby plays some request game in WC3 TFT nowadays and goes for tauren + shamans. 
---
So much smashing.
---
That’s just one way it’s going to be exploited. Dealing with people pressuring you to give them items either trough harassment or offerings of gold is going to be a common occurrence.
---
I love you man also I play hunter STRICTLY
---
I am not an expert, but I believe Enchanting is only recommended for leveling due to quest reward items.  Otherwise anything could just be sent to an Enchanting alt.  Enchanting is also an expensive profession.  I do like the idea of crafting early wands for casters, but again that can be done on an alt.  
---
Honestly my worry is if a casual player like me should go Enchanting at all.  It seems incredibly competitive, and raiders would have all the best enchants anyway.  
---
Leveling with tailoring/enchanting is painful. You will be broke.
---
I'm doing it on my warlock cuz free mount.
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
Scorpid Venom quest
---
Rocket Car parts
---
Turtle Scale Quest
---
Bird Bones Quest
---
Basilisk Quest
---
Additionally Horde have 2 more quests in the insects + the whole questchain that takes you between Booty Bay and Shimmering Flats multiple times after completing the Load Lightening quest (birds)
---
Players never even saw normal GMs, so how on earth could you have seen anyone restore the items, you are only reporting about the 2 instances you knew about.  What about the 1000s of players on your realm you never met also request items, then multiply that by the 100 realms WoW had.  There were 1000s of loot trades you were just unaware of.
---
I said it pretty clearly, this wasn't a common instance for an individual, but across a game with (at the time 2 million players) it's just a constant stream of tickets for the GMs.  Everyone is constantly making a mistake but with that many people someone is always making a mistake.
---
I agree, which is why they shouldn't fuck up a not have loot trading.
---
took me until at least 20 to learn that
---
I rolled a rogue in classic but by the time I was into raiding (TBC and WotLK) I was healing. I really enjoyed healing since you feel valuable, however, more levels and talents provided more tools at your disposal, which to me made healing enjoyable (if this was TBC I'd no doubt play priest). I'm between rogue and priest. Can you give me some insight into raiding as a rogue in classic, or in general if you never made it that far? I'm a PVP first person but I know you need to raid to get gear. I'm actually looking forward to stepping into raids I barely touched in classic so I think I'll enjoy either role, just trying to figure out what I want.
---
I just finished the Durotar campaign in FT and it was so good. Unfortunately, the other FT campaigns aren't really doing it for me. I am on the second mission of the Alliance campaign and I am not really loving it. NE was just alright for me. I want to play the UD campaign but I have to slog through the Alliance campaign first...
---
There are some guides on how to make gold through tailoring, but honestly if you’re under time constraints and want to enjoy leveling I say stick with Tailor/Enchant for solo purposes. Make your own gear as you level has its own feeling of reward. Make money a different way with fishing and cooking. I make more than enough through that to pay for my mount at 40.
---
spent 10 levels as warlock auto attacking with a staff and pet. called me brother in the room to show him this “melee class that has a demon pet.” he said, “i think you can cast that spell” and pointed at shadow bolt on my action bar.
---
There is both rule 1 and 7.
---
Dude pvt server people are always like you need to roll orc if you wanna PvP warrior. I'm like psh do you know how much I miss war stomping, mortal strike then executing someone casting a heal.
---
A lot of that had to do with Bungie buying back the rights to Destiny. While there are countless reasons to dislike Blizzard, they (Blizzard) we’re in the right to cut staff due to the fact they’ll be losing an entire game.
---
Wasn’t it always?
---
Autitistic mod guy managed to rationalize some horseshit about how it wasn't sufficiently on topic im sure, regardless that people here actually want to talk about it, as evidenced by their participating in it.
---
The opinion I offer on your mindset of wanting to fulfill an interactive, high ceiling, very impactful class, I would offer up resto shaman. Resto shaman totem buffs, specifically being able to buff your party with multiple totem buffs of the same element (Grace of Air/Windfury or Windfury/Tranquil air), keeping your other buff totems up as well, all the while being able to stay mana healthy and be able to hit important chain heals for raid healing at the appropriate rank, again to stay mana healthy and not wasting mana on overhealing (BIG DEAL). If you can do that, you will be responsible for a very noticable DPS boost to your party with windfury, enable your dps to start dpsing much sooner with threat reduction, while being able to raid heal like a boss. When threat becomes a non issue later in the fight, you can sub in the agility totem for the extra crit. Shaman is something you should strongly consider for overall impact to a group, not just healing numbers.
---
Funny that the thread does fine once you and your discord are asleep
---
Gms were never allowed to interact with the game world.
---
All your interaction happened with a person behind a program that amounted to AIM with tools to help players in game.  If a GM did go in game they were almost always invisible except under very rare circumstances, when the ZG plague happened was a time you may have seen a live GM on your realm, and not many other exceptions.
---
Absolutely agreed. I've lost loot in dungeons because I've been outrolled, because people have rolled on shit they shouldn't, and because of ninjas. Nothing felt worse than the time I was in a group where a husband and wife were rolling for each other.
---
My big moment was playing my Warrior, and when I grouped with a couple people to do some questing I had no concept of tanking and holding threat. I remember the day I first saw the ability “Taunt” and I thought, “Why would I want something to attack me?” Thankfully that group of folks was nice and clues me in on what my role as a Warrior really was.
---
I loved the winter saber grind personally
---
Enchanting is very expensive to level and if it’s your first character they will be broke and struggling to afford the mount. 
---
My plan is to go tailoring + herbalism and swap herbs to enchant once I’m 60 and set with gold. It is very expensive!
---
"Oh! This situation has the potential of being funny. Let's laugh together! Ha. Ha ha. Ha. Ha ha. Ha. Haha. Ha. DO YOU GUYS ENJOY WORLD OF WARCRAFT?! &gt;:D"
---
Lmao if it evolves like retail were all permanently uninstalling this time bro. Stay true to the Warcraft part and the world part at the same time or heck off
---
We have the whole database of vanilla armor and item values archived, the biggest things are going to be stats on mobs and bosses, maybe a mechanic of mobs/bosses fleshed out and quest xp. 
---
I really don't think much more will be different.
---
All very fair. I can relate that a bit to DPS meters as well. The other week we pulled in a PUG hunter for heroic Conclave and he was doing some really nice damage. Then when I looked at logs, I noticed over the course of 15\~ pulls, he had taken roughly 3x as much raptor damage as any other non-tank. He was just tunnelling DPS, not bothering to Disengage or Turtle.
---
So with logs, there are certainly ways to look beyond just damage numbers. I want to top damage meters, but I eqally want to be hit by frog less than anyone else.
---
That's a lot of hunters
---
For me any music other than the ingame OST is only acceptable during farming stuff on my own. During raids I turn off ingame music as well. I find it distracting.
---
Me and my discord? Are you accusing me of brigading your thread? LOL
---
You're the one that kept on deleting your thread 4 times in a row and then posted it on an alternate account. The only reason your threads "weren't doing fine" is because you were deleting them 10 minutes after I called you out of reposting the exact same thread.
---
Yes.
---
I think cosplays do not belong in /r/gaming, and I think the 6,000 daily posts of “I got my Paladin commissioned!” do not belong in /r/wow.  
---
Both of these items belong in fuckoffville.
---
How were you a ret paladin without spending talent points?
---
You're describing like 99% of YouTubers there pal
---
I don’t think so. I can only talk for myself and I was also very hardcore on private servers playing up to 16 hours a day. But when server closed it wasn’t a big problem for me. I think we often mistake passion for addiction
---
Looks like hundeds of people. But I'm fine with that.
---
My issue is that certain intresting discussion posts arn't visable by alot of people who casually scroll tru the Top Posts. Im not a fan of art on this reddit page because I'm here for gameplay footage, stratagy discussions, tips and tricks and entertaining stuff.
---
But that is me personally. I dont think we should not allow art.
---
Its to early for footage, most stratagies are tought to be perfect already. I know most tips and tricks already...
---
So for right now I'm waiting for news from Blizzard so we have something to discus. Something to set straight if we disagree. Or something to be happy about that is coming.
---
I like it personally
---
I’m about to get a new setup for my personal computer. Never going to spend money on my work equipment lol
---
Till 10 you will kite for sure not much but you probably will. What about when you hit 60? You will never do PVP? About PVE - placing traps req macro or fast clicking on 2 keys, the rotation is 2 buttons, not one, they might ask you to kite a mob, you have to control your pet to switch targets etc. Not going to count all multishots on trash, that will go wrong.
---
What difference does a free mount make when you still need to buy a proper one?
---
Damn nice find. I’m going to use some of these!
---
Well considering he's not drawing them himself...
---
16h/day in a chair staring at a screan can't be healthy mate, i'm sorry.
---
I'm building a new desk, upgrate some hardware. Clean up some software and maybe if I feel like it. Buy a new monitor. Its not really needed but I feel its oke to treat myself something nice.
---
I got some blue daggers from SM as rogue, and was sinister striking with those babies nonstop.  Wasn't until later that I realized I shouldn't be using sinister strike with low dmg/quick weapons, and also that they had intellect on them :P
---
Ah I remember my old g15 keyboard.
---
Thanks for the opposing take. I'd hate to think I'll end up bored in the roll because re-rolling won't be as simple (time-wise) in Classic.
---
Regarding good DPS vs. a good healer, why do you feel that way. I know as a mage in Classic, I'll just be spaming frostbolt like every other mage, so the other edge I'm going to gain over other mages is through use of consumables from Alch and Eng and maybe some tighter mechanics on some encounters. With retail, my edge comes from so many different places and I think my ability to keep a near-perfect rotation going regardless of what else is happening in a fight is a great strength of mine. The ability ot mash one key feels like a lot of the skill comes out of it. Not to mention, with threat being an issue, I cna only imagine how enraged I'll be if I have to stop dealing damage because of tank threat again...
---
Activision doesn't like fun so no.
---
I hate comments as the one you replied to. They're patronizing and so far up their own ass they can't conceive any other way to have fun than their's.
---
I thought profession levels were "remembered". So when I hit ~15 or 20 or so, I swapped my Herbalism/Tailoring to Mining/BS to try it out. I eventually tried all of the professions and capped them out at 75, then just went back to Herb/Tailoring.
---
I was so disappointed when I started off back at level 1.
---
But hey, at least I stopped at 75 and not 200-300 or something - that would have been awful.
---
Good morning
---
This is why I was never a fan of gating content in an end of life patch. Everything before the final raid is nerfed and easy.
---
No one wants to drudge through a watered down MC, then a watered down BWL, then a watered down ZG, then a watered down AQ just to finally enjoy one decent raid after 2 years.
---
Progressive loot helps but unless they literally go all the way with recreating it as it was then its just wasting time. Jumping around Orgimmar will be more fun.
---
I’m planning on getting a big boy gaming desktop in the 3k+ range, a 4K wise monitor of some kind, a mechanical keyboard, and a new wired naga mouse.
---
It's a bit up in the air whether the transition will be smooth for you. I was dog shit as dps in TBC and early wrath. But when I leveled a priest I was totally in my zone. Healing isn't about rotations, it's about crisis management, triage, raid awareness, and predicting damage. I've raided with dps who tried healing and found it confusing and not fun. But it probably depends more on the person than the role switching. That being said, while I considered myself an exceptional healer in wrath and cata, I suspect I will have to learn new healing skills in vanilla since wrath and cata were all about "firehose healing" while vanilla sounds like mana management is key. 
---
The question of whether you will enjoy the role change is difficult. I enjoy doing things I'm good at rather than seeking out new challenges to conquer. What makes the game/raid fun for you? You might be surprised or even disappointed to realize you're not actually killing the bosses anymore. Many dps I've talked to mention how important it is for them to feel they are actively killing the big baddies.
---
I played Resto shaman through vanilla, BC and wotlk. Cleared all content in the expansion, as for vanilla I didn't do AQ40 or Naxx. I remember enjoying my time as a healer but it would be nice to play something different. At the moment I'm stuck between rogue and warrior, what should I play Reddit?
---
not me but a guildie didn't realize that gear affected stats until about level 45. turns out she played the "im a girl help me level" card for all her leveling until that point and was only wearing random pieces of gear because she liked the look of it. we only realized it when people took her through dungeons and wondered why she wasn't doing any damage.
---
But... how? Don't enemies resist a huge chunk of your damage if they're too high of a level? (assuming you even hit to begin with)
---
Remember it.... i still use it!
---
Pls. Or slower power creep like OSRS. Where things aren’t instantly invalidated by the release of new content. 
---
Hell, you still have people at rock crabs with sand crabs being a thing
---
When I first fired up the game I asked my buddies when I would start picking up female armor. Confused, they asked what toon i was playing and still seemed weirded out by the fact i seemed to miss any armor i could wear. Dumb me had been picking up ‘mail’ armor over and over and as a priest was obviously not able to wear it. Yeah, they made fun of me for literal years about ‘mail and female armor.’
---
As dps if you're super geared it doesn't matter if your tanks threat isn't up to par. You might do 2k dps but if you pull aggro and die all that gear is useless to your raid. If you're super geared as a healer you can bring less healers and more dps making bosses die faster and increasing the speed of your raid overall.
---
3k destop just for classic is maybe a little bitty overkill. But I bet you play more tha  just wow.
---
I tried ultrwide and it wasn't my thing. 
---
Also I broke way to many naga's. Im hoping for a good mmo mouse thats not Razer because I dont know if its just me l, but it feels cheap.
---
Goodluck building your new gamecorner!
---
If you roll a Train down it's Track twice then it will do mostly the same thing both times.
---
WoW is a theme-park MMO. It is no coincidence that Tarren Mill vs Southshore was a hot spot on every server while other zones remained quiet. The battles were no more spontaneous than the popping of corn once you begin to cook the kernels.
---
Let me spell it out for you. If you hit 60 and respec to fury with a thrash blade, it wont even matter if you don't have +hit gear. You might gain an extra attack but it could miss thus my reply. 
---
You need hit gear to land attacks
---
You need to land attacks in order to get rage. 
---
You need rage to DPS. 
---
Farming BWL is when you want to consider respecing to fury DPS unless you want to be a meme/gimp. By then the thrash blade would be obsolete.
---
That would be it. :)
---
No, its the culture of private server players and retail, where they don't see the same face twice.
---
I cannot wait for the comeback of the PvP videos with the heavy metal soundtracks.
---
I should put this on my list, to re-watch some old ones before Classic releases.
---
This is a common myth in the p server player base. Many of the things are core specific, based on the research a couple of dudes did through various logs or videos from back in the day. A lot of the information is not completely accurate, a lot of bugs exist on p servers and a lot of bugs that were in vanilla might not be recreated.
---
WoW Classic is not WoW from 2004, it's a remake. They are trying to make it as close as possible but there's so many variables that there just has to be a lot of unknowns about it.
---
It’s you OP that is in for a wakeup call.
---
I've played private for years and most people have some etiquette when it comes to that. I think these people are from BFA or an earlier expansion who are coming back to try classic
---
I was 14, WoW was my first mmorpg on my PC - i clicked everything.
---
So there I was in Northshire Abbey on my male human mage, when i happened to drag my fireball and frostbolt spell off my bars while clicking them. I thought i ran out of fireballs and resorted to meleeing every mob from level 3 to level 8 before I decided mages were too hard and deleted him. 
---
Then i decided to make a warlock - which i got to level 20 and deleted him too because i wanted to play a rogue.
---
Eventually got to level 30ish when the first hat was available for purchase from the leather armor vendor and spent all my gold buying the white gear from the vendor because it matched.
---
I like the thought. I rather enjoy how HS manages to pull so many ideas from warcraft.
---
However, I'd rather not restructure all the routes, so that Naxx is last.
---
And if Naxx isn't last, it annoys me just like how retail didn't finish with Legion. I felt the burning legion's invasion should've been a slower build up rather than one sudden expansion, especially after WoD.
---
Isnt this something that should be agreed on before you go into a dungeon?  Some groups might go for only need on upgrades, others may decide that all BoEs are free rolls for gold.
---
If I'm being honest, a big thing that drives me now is to compete on logs. I want to be the best -- I want to take every edge I can find to outperform the rest of the raid because I know that my attention to detail is going to give us the best chance to succeed.

I'm in a weird spot right now because I've been playing BFA since Nov. and outside a few core guild members, we've largely recruited very casual players for this expansion. There are encounters where I'm doing 2-3x as much damage as some of the other DPS (and I'm playing a mage, who suck right now). I know my performance is more related to who I'm playing with than my talent. I'm a good player, but the gap in damage is from others just not knowing wtf they're doing, not double potting, not gearing or talenting right, etc.
---
So with Vanilla, I'd like to see if I can move away from that mindset for raiding. I want to kill KT and I'll do whatever needs to be done to accomplish that. Still though, I have pride in my performance and I know healing meters would certainly be relevant to me. I think I'd feel lousy if I ended up at the bottom of the meters after 15 years of dominating guild DPS meters.
---
Do only alchemists get to roll on flask recipes?
---
GMs arent that important
---
I started raiding as a healer and switched to dps for vanilla. It was probably my biggest regret. Was topping the dps meter satisfying? Hell yea it was but my guild had so many issues with finding good healers I regretted my choice. Good dps are a dime a dozen but a truly good healer is rare.
---
I came over from Runescape in early 2005 when I was 13 and rolled a rogue. So my idea of gear was mostly armor based, and my idea of leveling was mostly grinding mobs endlessly. So I basically was just buying whatever white gear I could find (I think I also made some as a leather worker). A guildie smithed me two daggers, but that was about it as far as greens except maybe one or two other pieces of grear I had acquired. 
---
I genuinely had no understanding of stats, or item rarity, or anything. I got a blue to drop when I was in my early 20s (which I had achieved mostly by grinding in The Barrens) and I sold it for like 2g which I thought was a shit ton. A guy eventually whispered me and told me all about item rarity and linked his Outlaw Sabre and Meteor Shard. Thus my first dungeon was RFK in my late 20s, potentially even early 30s, and I got a Swinetusk Shank that I used forever. 
---
I also leveled (and even started raiding as!) this weird bastardized hemo dagger spec because I liked that sub gave you two extra attacks to click. It took me so many months to hit 60. Didn’t help that I didn’t understand rested for a while either. I was away for a week over the summer and my friend asked me if I remembered to log out in an inn. I had no idea that that mattered and had just left myself logged off in front of the inn.
---
I figured everything out pretty quickly at 60 and eventually made my way to AQ40 by the end of patch 1.12. But man. I’ll never have an experience of true blindness like that again. It was awesome.
---
Not knowing that my warlock pet doesn’t jump down the cliff with me... I learned fast.
---
Yeah I do. CSGO and Starcraft 2 comp among others. Ive used a wireless razor naga epic chroma and I must say it was built very well. That beside said I’m switching back to wired just for the reduced stress of charging, interference, and that extra .04 seconds lmao
---
Exactly what I was going to say. Original Vanilla culture didn’t have an epidemic of this.
---
The real problem will be the Cata+ babies and pserver players who migrate to Classic. They are bringing these attitudes and mindsets with them. How will this affect the Vanilla community?
---
r/wow - where people show off mistakes they made in a tattoo parlor and people self promote shitty art.
---
Ohh so this isn’t a pserver.
---
They for sure have prio, A flask recipie is a huge deal for them especially early classic
---
Considering there are heaps of gold to be made from the items in question, yes it's understandable that pugs would roll need even if they couldn't use it. If it's a guild run then it might be a little different, ie edgemasters going to the guild bank.
---
&gt; Thinking doing /pat on my bear would increase pet happiness. I made a few people laugh with that one.
---
I know we've been telling blizzard we want no changes, but I want one change now.  This is perfect
---
I'd usually just ask for clarification while everyone is heading to the dungeon. You've got a while to wait for everyone to show up, plenty of time to get the whole group on the same page as far as how BoE's will be handled.
---
If you don't need on a purple bow, you are an idiot.
---
Nah i think it’ll be longer because some classes level slower no matter how good the player is. It’ll take a bit longer to fill out a raid. Basically gotta wait on the rogue/warriors.
---
Uh, did we play the same game in 2004/5? Everyone I played with did this, *everyone*, because the gold is way more valuable than a stat increase (unless you're the 60 buying the gear for an alt/twink), and because it prevents ninja looting of those items. 
---
That's why you just say "everyone roll need on BOE blues/purples" at the beginning of the instance and no one argues. Maybe at server launches it's different though, I wouldn't know.
---
This isn't even a little true in vanilla
---
maybe its just me, but the mob list doesnt seem to be working properly. i just get an sql error and id really like to see the list because ill be playing paladin as well
---
My thinking as well and another reason I was leaning healer.
---
Bruh, that's like 75% of the internet, and 90% of this sub.
---
"I don't like (A) so let's do (B that other people don't like) instead!
---
Idk why people wouldn’t love to see new content related to classic. I loved TBC and Wrath, but i already know what those xpacs consist of. Plus if they re released these expansions, then the people who loved cata/MOP would want those expansions released.
---
Blizz would be having to manage so many different games
---
How do you verify they are an alchemist?
---
I see how it killed world pvp. For me, who never does world PvP the way I play has not changed
---
It just means that your level 40 mount isn't a problem. On a pserver I was able to grind out a lot of gold when leveling 50-60 and got my epic mount pretty quick too. That was on an established economy though, so I was able to sell a lot of crafted tailoring gear. Might not be the case on fresh classic.
---
Here? What’s there to say about Classic?
---
The only things I keep seeing are:
---
1. Loot Trading is bad
---
2. Sharding is bad-ish
---
3. I can’t decide between Human Hunter or Undead Hunter. Let’s talk racials
---
4. I hope they make TBC/Wrath Classic
---
5. I hope they do Runescape OSRS new content
---
We’re starved for information. That’s why digital art of a 15 year old zone is trending lol
---
Whats the point in the greed button if everything is needed. I remember greed for when you wanted to sell, need when you want to wear. Correct me if I'm wrong but at some point didn't blizzard make blue BoE's bind to you if you needed them.
---
I spent two years playing an Elemental Shaman in Cata and I enjoyed the class, but after the expansion was done, even though I was the most valuable DPS in the guild, I felt like my efforts were a bit diminished because the spec was in such a bad spot during Cata (similar to mages now!). I'd hate to role a Shaman in classic to only feel the same way about having not played a priest instead. I also am kind of dreading the idea of needing to drop one totem at a time...
---
I mean if you actually have to verify have them make the most basic flask
---
I'd disagree. I mean I've played private servers off and on for 7ish years now and the ClassicCast bros don't have anything worth talking about at all, for example. There's a lot of fluff.
---
That's true. In general the effectiveness of a DPS is very easy to measure: how much damage they do, how much avoidable damage they take, even certain utility responsibilities such as decursing for mages, are all directly traceable in meters. Whereas things like saving a tank from dying after a spike, providing buffs for your group via totems, etc. are much less straightforward to measure. 
---
And all of this is disregarding the fact that not all healing done is equally useful. Paladins for instance put out insane healing numbers because their most efficient heal also happens to be a fast cast time, making it really easy to snipe heals when topping off the raid. Not to say keeping the raid topped off isn't useful, but it's not always as impactful as saving someone from dying (not that Paladins can't do that, but you get the idea of what I mean by "useful" healing).
---
But you still need to buy a mount at 40 though.
---
Healing meters are VERY sketchy as a performance indicator. To be considered a good healer you need to keep your raid alive while not standing in fire. If the boss dies, your meters are ok, and you didn't stand in the wrong place, then you did well. There's no real epeen measuring when it comes to healing. If competition is important to you, stick with dps.
---
Nice read, I also think grinding can be very relaxing, I plan to grind alot with my first character in Classic. But I will watch Star Trek and One Piece instead on my second screen.
---
And then after you know they’re an alchemist, you give them prio on an item worth 1k+ gold that’s only function is to generate income? Sounds unfair to me. Why do they get priority on an item that generates gold when I could roll on it and sell it to generate gold too
---
Good perspective! Thanks.
---
Though I'm not sure I agree wih your point on good DPS being easy to find. I've been raiding for 15 years and there are maybe three people I've played with who I really respected as DPS. I think mediocre and bad DPS are a dime a dozen.
---
I would prefer a TBC release with optional character copy and fresh classic servers that eventually merge into a permanent classic server but before the merge players can copy the char to a TBC server.
---
Behold Flight Paths??
---
I did this. Got to around level 8 in the trial version when someone came up to me and asked if I was “questing”. My response was ”what is questing?”
---
I think the general guess on Reforged has been end of 2019.  And with us already being halfway through March without a release date for Reforged, I think it's fair to assume it's coming after.  I'm excited anyway, It'll be something fun to play between raiding and pvp.
---
I get that sometimes too.
---
classicdb site &gt; database &gt; NPCs &gt; Demons / Undead
---
Should show a list of demons / undead. Sort by level, and check out your options.
---
I remember most of my groups greeding on BoE. 
---
Just speak up, you will find that most players are decent people just trying to have a good time playing a game. You decide together if everyone is going to need or everyone is going to greed, same result. 
---
When it comes to something like Edgemasters where someone actually needs it as an upgrade then I remember that being respected in general.
---
I leveled my priest as tailoring/enchanting back in the day. I made decent profits, mainly from tailoring. All the mobs you will be grinding that drop the cloth comes in handy. Enchanting, i made more from the mats than selling actual enchants. It does not become profitable until much later in the game, since low levels will be changing gear so often. However, if you keep up with it, you will make some decent money later on.
---
since questing will always be infinitely more fun than grinding, that settées the question for me, but whatever pokes your holes.
---
So you'll watch like 8% of One Piece by the time you get to 60?
---
On my server in vanilla everyone just rolled greed on blues unless it was a upgrade then they would roll need but would have to equip it before we pulled the next trash to show that they actually wanted to use it or risk getting kicked from group and the server getting warned.
---
Epics on the other hand was a need roll by all. It was just an unwritten rule that everyone knew about.
---
Have you lost your mind, boy?!
---
"normal" server isn't a choice for classic. It's going to be PvP, PvE or RP just like the original.
---
If you add more content, I’d increase the level cap as well. Just because Classic was great and it’s level cap was 60, doesn’t mean 60 is the only way. I’d love to see new content in combination with the existing expansions. Literally turn this project into WoW 2 if it’s that successful
---
Umm, this was standard on my server. Can’t ninja loot the boe if everyone needs
---
I didn't find the AH until level ~30 and vendored a ton of cloth and mats...
---
Nah, the real mistake was not going Alch + Herb and being rich.
---
Post Naxx would be really fun IMO.  I think you can have TBC and post Naxx servers along side each other.  
---
Let’s say you have one Vanilla cycle for two years.  Then release fresh servers as well as TBC.  Then after two more years introduce a Phase 7 + 8 + 9 in the level 60 world.
---
Exactly how I feel. I’m not opposed to new content as well. I still think Wrath was supposed to be before TBC
---
Yup I talked to a GM, dude was human but 8x larger than my tauren. Not sure where this wanker thought he got his info from.
---
I dont understand why priority and etiquette is hard to grasp for some people.
---
If the dude is a 300 level alchemist he should get the flask. He can make flasks for progression raiding, pvp, dungeons. Also sell flasks for constant cash flow, He leveled the profession to 300 to do this.
---
You on the other hand would sell the recipe you cant even learn for like 50g ONE time and most likely get undercut and have to settle for less. Why should you get the same priority as max level alchemist
---
I had been playing for 3 days when I accidentally dragged my Fireball off my bars, and I thought I had lost the spell forever. Then upon realizing it's impossible to level a mage without spells, I deleted my character and started over from scratch.
---
Okay but where did you come up with 7% being the cut off? And also it's not difficult at all to get hit capped with just pre-bis gear. And I see you saying in other comments fury warriors aren't good till BWL which is laughable, you should probably step back and  listen to everyone here who clearly knows a lot more than you do.
---
Yeah, isn't it the first zone when horde/alliance meet when questing and just when leveling starts to slow down?
---
OP is going  get burned HARD when he is the first one to click greed on a 200g + BoE while the rest roll need.
---
for some items yes. I think in some situations (example having to roll against 4 other people for Edgemasters in a dungeon) is ridiculous
---
BoE have always been fair game for rolling Need unless you establish something different at the beginning of the group.
---
My problem is that they are basically recreating vanilla on a new engine, so it's likely a lot of specific glitches wont be in classic. Like wall jumping...
---
Here is a list of mobs/level/locations for grinding XP.
---
https://classicwowguides.com/
---
Flask recipes are worth WAY more than 50g. One recipe will pay for your Epic Mount instantly.
---
great meme (i  dont even like his videos) but low-effort has nothing to do with running ads? They're completely unrelated, so I gotta give you a 3/10 for this one. Don't try so hard.
---
That sounds like a horrible experience. I'm sure there's a quest called 'deeprun tram' which makes you take it?
---
Fury warrior. Just switched from 2handed obsidian sword to deathbringer and dooms edge - was spamming my attack button for more raids than I’d care to admit.... eventually figure out I wasn’t swinging my offhand...
---
Oh same for sure. The first character I hit 60 with was a mage, I joined a group for MC, people told me I needed some app called cursive or something and I said pssh, not like I use the dispel magic often anyways... Next thing I know everyone is yelling at me.
---
As long as there is a very clear line drawn between adding content and changing gameplay than I don't see why anyone would be worried about new content ruining the game. Six months may be a bit quick though.
---
I would hope new content isn't strictly vertical though (i.e., new raid content past Naxx). Go horizontal, maybe a new level 35-45 leveling zone, a new 20-man raid that fits between AQ and Naxx (like ZG fit between MC and BWL). They can even leverage existing content, for example do something with Mount Hyjal, take Kharazhan from TBC and tune it to level 60.
---
Doesn't resto shaman take over the hps meters in Naxx?  Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Explain? I don't know what you're talking about.
---
more what should i play, #nochanges, and classicwow is not just nostalgia posts?
---
thanks a lot friend. this is gonna be very helpful
---
I did almost the exact same thing. I got to 30ish on my warrior before I realized I had talent points.
---
its not like a player is precluded from having flasks until they receive the recipe and craft them. he also could just as easily buy flasks for progression raiding, pvp, and dungeons. the game has a liquid currency for a reason
---
also, friendly reminder that the important flask recipes easily and often sell anywhere between 800-1500 gold depending on the age of the server and the recipe in question
---
They are a bit trigger happy. A while ago I posted a link to that old "find your old classic friends" and it was removed for being "not classic related". The same link that they have in their own wiki. 
---
To their credit they did re-enable the post when I messaged them for clarity on how my post was unrelated.
---
Weird - I’ve spoken to about 4 GMs (NA) in the past year and all still incredibly wonderful experiences. We had a nice conversation each time and never did it feel rushed or cut short. Even when my requests were sometimes of my fault they helped happily.
---
When I was a low level teenager in TBC, I made a GM ticket saying I was upset and had had a terrible day. It was incidental to my main issue, I forget what that was. But not long after, a GM whispered me saying they'd heard I a rough day and were here to help. Next thing I know he turns up right in front of me in nagrand, waves, and teleports us to the top of a nagrand flying rock thing, near some waterfall I think. He starts flying me and him in the air, soft falling us back down again, spawns a load of critters, loads of genuinely weird shit that I have never seen before. I print screened the fuck out of that encounter, but I lost my hard drive... Either way, really awesome memory that I still think about a decade plus later as a 26yo.
---
I like how some icons in WoW are directly lifted from Warcraft 3.
---
New 60 content just doesn't make sense to me. We're not going back to playing classic for new content. They tried new content, they were called expansions, and they got worse and worse. I dunno about you, but I'm going back to Classic because their new content sucks. Blizzard would have to tiptoe an incredibly fine line of making raids that worked within the limitations of vanilla while still being interesting and new enough - you *cannot* have the complexity of modern fights in Vanilla so they'd be specifically gimping themselves in that department. They'd have to create new assets in the same graphical style of a 15 years old game. They'd have to rework the lore into some alternate timeline BS. They'd have to ensure that they tuned it so finely that people didn't just move on from Naxx as soon as they could start clearing the new "Tier 4".
---
But more than anything, Classic would no longer be classic. It'd be retail WoW in a 1.12 client. I believe that if you think there's even a chance you're getting new 60 content, you're crazy, and it goes against the entire idea of classic, but that's just me.
---
upvotes and downvotes are a godawful way to get quality content to the top. It rewards low effort pictures/memes that can be quickly clicked and upvoted
---
I'm at least 55% sure that I couldn't take that flight path yet since I was missing one in the middle. I don't think the southern quest hub with an ancient had a flight point in vanilla, so maybe it was necessary to have the point in Felwood to make the connection? Or else it was at the other quest hub before you make it to the city? 
---
Alternately it was just an entirely different layer of noobishness.
---
I think hunter is confusing for most new players tbh.
---
Me and my two brothers used to spam serpent sting.
---
I agree with your edit. The expansions were great games with rich history and lore. There’s no reason to NOT want them! Ironically, people would want changes made to them! 
---
Classic ≠ Vanilla. Classic is a project to keep a version or versions of the game permanently playable. There could be Classic Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, etc. 
---
I wouldn’t mind seeing new content related to the main world that ISNT Cataclysm, but after Naxx you really need to increase the level cap
---
Got to about level 30 or so before I realized what LFM stood for. I thought all these people were looking for mage, wasn’t sure why they were so popular.
---
Are your parents siblings?
---
I can't give any real insight into Vanilla raiding as a rogue unfortunately - heard its pretty similar to just keep slice n dice up haha
---
Where did I say 7% cut off?
---
I'll be interested in seeing your raid logs in MC / early BWL for a good laugh.
---
I think the "best" would be instead of adding existing expansions and increasing level cap to add more lateral content new dungeons keeping with classic feel and balancing. Adding more tiers of gear or gear that allows more specific options to be viable.
---
&gt;Well;
---
Semicolon? Why?
---
I hope they don't classify it as a starter zone. What I classify as a starter zone is the zone in which you spawn and where you are from levels 1-5. I think the zones after that are big enough to where sharding shouldn't be used.
---
Trigger my ding dong you nasty boy
---
Well of course not, but in general you should not implement a feature that has such a big negative impact on big part of the game.
---
It's like, I don't really care for PvE. I just want to PvP and I enjoy farming gold. So to me it would be great if they just allow me to buy PvE gear for gold, then I don't need to touch raids and I can get my gear. But this would completely destroy PvE. While it is a lovely feature for PvP players to be able to get the gear they want without having to raid it is still a shit design because it impacts other parts of the game negatively.
---
Underrated comment
---
I don't care if getting 40 people together was a pain in the ass. This is fucking awesome.
---
People are going to need a lot more than 6 months before we start thinking about post Naxx. I'd say at least a year.
---
Not the right game, but same publishers... at a lan party first time playing D2, i was going assassin and my friend looked over at my talen tree at the start of the third act. I had only put points into finishing moves, no combo generators. He had been wondering why i dealth next to no damage
---
Astranaar is the next flight path down from Auberdine, none inbetween, in any case I don't think it matters? Could be wrong?
---
Source: Private Server
---
Pick enchanting if you hate money.
---
Tailoring will not generally help you while levelling because you'll be outleveled for anything you can craft - in general. The only real reason to take tailoring is for the BoP robes or Bloodvine set bonus. You think you'll make a lot of money selling things you make via tailoring but this is simply not the case.
---
Aside from rare raid drop recipes, the only profession that consistently makes good profit is Alchemy, even with the base trainer recipes.
---
&gt;but having enchanting would provide me with wands without relying on AH availability/prices.
---
The extra gold you get from vendoring greens + any other profession you have (preferably gathering) will be more than enough to buy any and you want and have gold left over.
---
I hate to say this since I love the fantasy of enchanting, but it's a really thankless and unprofitable profession in Vanilla.
---
I’ve had 4 great interactions with GM’s this past year. 3 BFA 1 legion. All were fun and extremely helpful. 
---
The big thing is that most things these days don’t warrant a ticket involving a human anymore (thankfully so for that matter), so it’s less common as a result. Not so much less common because the GMs aren’t good. 
---
I imagine whatever support staff they have in place they’ll still be high quality, but once again less interacted with.
---
I didn’t know what a dot was and spammed Serpent Sting repeatedly before my friend said “dude, you have arcane shot too.”
---
Paladin, Hunter, or lock.
---
Cast sequence macro ftw.
---
I deleted my first Hunter because I did not know that they used arrows. When all arrows where gone, kid me just thought the character was broken.
---
Level 10 warlock. Some random guy boosted me through RFC and I got the robe of evocation. Sat in my bags waiting and waiting for me to level up. Took me days to finally get to level 12 - picked up enchanting and didn’t understand how it worked. Pissing about pressing buttons. DE’d robe of evocation. Saddest guy on the server right there and then.
---
Does anybody know how reckoning works? Do all 5 melee attacks have separate chances of proccing SoC?
---
It's no different than a new server release in 2006.
---
he uses a website to make these dude..... lol
---
Yeah, the mods were dumbasses for removing that.  That post is easily applicable to vanilla.  For example, say you're a Retail player that's trying to prepare for WoW.  You're familiar with the sub-60 dungeons, but you're curious whether that knowledge will be applicable in vanilla - or whether the dungeons have changed.
---
Completely on-topic and relevant discussion.  But as often happens, overeager power-tripping mods remove it.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Horrible maybe. Not pathetic though. Certainly warmongering. Look at it from an Alliance PoV.
---
You blew up Theramore, Gilneas and Darnassus.
---
In the Cataclysm, SW and Loch Modan got badly damaged - nothing happened to any Horde city ever until BfA.
---
Alliance King was killed b/c of Horde. Now we have the most pathetic leader ever. Bolvar was killed back in Wrath and turned into the shit fake LK.
---
Alliance have had a much worse time imo.
---
In 2004: mostly ambient music, like Brian Eno. Some NIN and alt rock.
---
2015-2017 private servers: mostly synthwave like mitch murder and the same ambient albums.
---
2019: D: all the above.
---
Say I'm a Retail-only player that wants to play Classic.  I'm curious whether my knowledge of the sub-60 dungeons will be applicable when Classic hits.
---
Tell me how that discussion isn't relevant to Classic WoW.
---
The cut staff was across Activision, Blizzard and King. Bungie already had cut all it's ties and wasn't affected by the staff layoffs. About 200 support staff at Blizzard were let go.
---
To be fair, they’ve been mostly irrelevant since wotlk lorewise.
---
They had their hero moment.
---
I remember most gamers in high school were listening to techno. (Me not so much)
---
(2004 - 2007) kids were listening to DJ Caffeine and drinking BAWLS. Perhaps you  could try to emulate that?
---
War stomp is too fun. For me, im torn between the most fun active, the most op racials, and the most op aesthetics and style. Its a hard call.
---
GMs will be automated I think :/
---
very true. would be tough to have things separated by server type
---
Playing as a night elf noob in Teldrassil, I accidently looted a corpse and then realized that I could loot all the sparkling corpses around me... I then proceeded to running around looting what I thought was other people's kills thinking I knew some secret everyone else didn't... Turns out it was just all the mobs I had killed and not looted recently.
---
The fact you think these recipes are 50g kinda exposes why you might hold this position. Good etiquette would be allowing the other 4 players a shot at winning lottery ticket that just dropped. 
---
Guilds are a different story, stuff like that should go to the resident alchemist and maybe the guild bank.
---
When I think of fun times, I just remember running Zul Farak (sp?) Over and over. And the stairs fight was an actual challenge!
---
This is probably the dumbest thing I've heard in WoW. Bravo :)
---
You realize this happens to both factions, right?  The amount of times I've died in Stonetalon to a ?? Alliance is through the roof.  There's going to be assholes/bored people/people who love fucking with helpless people/power trippers at every level on both factions all the time.
---
... that's literally the opposite of BOE.
---
Ahh, Tauren hunter. The most OP hunter race
---
I didn’t know spells were a thing so I meleed on my shaman until lvl 12.
---
Ive been seeing alot of your post about Hemorrhage and I am intrigue, but I saw when you said when you got to raiding you was subpar. What route would you take now? perharp switch specs to perform better in raids or?
---
It would feel absolutely terrible to walk into Stormwind and see people phasing in and out of the sharded zone.
---
Stormwind, Orgrimmar, these are all in the starter "zones."
---
If they are honest and aren't going to shard capital cities too, the transition needs to happen somewhere. Hopefully it's not right outside the gates of the cities.
---
If I see people phasing in and out in Orgrimmar I'm going to be a very sad Orc.
---
"I've played private for years" great, that's not vanilla. I played Vanilla in 2005. Rolling need on BOE happened *all the time*.
---
&gt;You would have to have over +7% hit for that to even matter
---
Since the warlock mount is trash, you'll want a real mount to use despite getting a free lock mount.
---
Genius xD
---
Considering everyone says Enchanting is a waste of time.. You really wonder if guilds will even have an enchanter.
---
&gt; why would you dislike someone for going fulltime with it and making more content for the people who watch it to enjoy.
---
Because it makes me a customer instead of a fellow enthusiast when someone I've watched makes that transition to full-time. Instead of it being a communal sharing of content and information, gathering together on stream out of mutual enjoyment of the content, it turns it into a performance with audience members to whom you have a responsibility for entertainment.        
---
          
---
I can appreciate that the ability to take a passion and make a living from it is desirable, and that your Es-brand hitting a critical mass to allow that to happen is meaningful and valuable to you. Congratulations for that. But it's not what I find compelling or interesting. I'm not a personality-watcher. I'm a classic dude who likes classic and doesn't like third parties capitalizing on it for their income, no matter how genuine their interest in the subject matter was to begin with.

I saw pants on a vendor with more armor than mine,  but had not enough money to get them. Did the math wrong,  and selling my actual pants was not enough to buy the new ones...and there was no buyback yet (or didn't know how). So I spent from level 14 to 37 pantless until new one dropped. I thought it was no big deal as the robes covered me anyway as a warlock.  So i did not use any cloth chest that didn't cover my legs for all those levels.
---
Still not as bad asone of my  paladin friends,  who I had to tell that  class trainers existed and what they did...at level 27. He leveled 27 levels as a paladin with the starter level 1 skills and autoattack. 
---
He never thought something was wrong because he was a dwarf with a big axe and axing things to death is what being a dwarf is all about.

Oh because over 7% means stop at 7. Okay.

Definitely would want to experience TBC for the first time, however either by porting my characters to another server, i would like to keep my vanilla toon on the original server that would get some new content too
---
It's 100% true, show me any shred of evidence that suggests otherwise.
---
In your estimation how did GMs work during vanilla?
---
Bloodwing was worth because they refuse to add legitimate bat mounts and my trolls needed a racial flyer.
---
Help convince me pick a dwarf warrior instead of a human. I really want to play dwarf but Im afraid the human racial is gonna gimp me for tanking and PvP. Im not sure if Im gonna tank in raids so Im wondering if the + skill for humans is really that important?
---
I’m not disagreeing with you that ranks need + hit, but as some one who MT and is part of my guild loot council, I would Prio mdps over tanks for the ring, depending on the patch and how full rags loot table you might have like a 30-40% drop chance on the ring.

I guess there isn't much reason to visit reddit if semi-original content is being looked down upon.

It's a hard call for me. I'm duo leveling a warrior AND my favorite lore is orc and tauren culture and their relationship. Not to mention they have the best racials for warrior and both look boss in good plate. It makes the decision harder. Torn between my two favorite races in game.
---
If I'm a tauren my girl will probably be a tauren shaman or druid. If I go orc she might go troll shaman or priest.
---
I mean, I won't disagree, that's definitely true. Though I don't think I'm the only one wanting more of a "classic" feel than just the final patch. It's obvious we're getting that with the progressive releases. But if the difficulty stays stagnant, the only thing that would last for any real duration would be Naxxramas. 
---
Don't get me wrong, Vanilla was pretty easy, but there was still a larger curve with earlier patches compared to the latter ones.
---
Personally I just don't trust that the content Blizzard would add would follow Vanilla's design principles or overall tone. I trust that they'll make an authentic Vanilla experience as they'll only have to recreate, but I think making new raids, dungeons, zones, etc which will fit into the game is beyond them. It's not even that I think they'd force their modern philosophy on us, it's more that I think any new content would feel like an imitation rather than an organic evolution.
---
I know OSRS is the example everyone is looking at here, but I think as a game it's much much easier to expand upon so many years later, just because its framework is much wider and "rules" are much looser in comparison. I also wouldn't trust the WoW community with a polling system like that, the community is already largely responsible for ruining the game once, and I have no doubt that they'd fall into the trap of conveniences all over again.
---
I'd honestly rather just play TBC, just because that's the natural evolution for the game. Not everything about it is great, but at the end of the day it'd follow the path set by Classic, which is recreating a game that is no longer available through legal means, and not to have them develop two different WoWs parallel to each other.
---
WoW is actually *way* less grindy overall than OSRS, but there's plenty of grinding to be done if you look for it. The main difference is that the only real grinding you can do is via combat; other skills like mining or cooking etc. don't take nearly as long to get to max level as getting your character level to 60 (max). When you're at 60 your grinding options are mostly:
---
\- Farming for money
---
\- Farming for materials to raid (or make items to sell for gold)
---
\- PvP ranking
---
Nostalgia only gets you so far. There's a reason for the dedicated fanbase of private server players throughout the years; the game is just flat-out great.
---
FFXIV had an interesting infinity-dungeon with Halls of the Dead, but if you’re looking for that experience in classic, just do a full BRD run.
---
Comparing a screenshot of six posts from r/wow and a screenshot of 6 posts from r/classicwow and then submitting that as a form of protest about the quality of content is perhaps the most delicious irony I have seen this week.
---
This isn't an "epidemic" brought on by players that started in later expansions, people have been needing on high value BoEs to sell since before I even started playing in early BC. Just clarify in chat before the dungeon begins.
---
What about the collectors edition pets?
---
Mini Diablo, panda, zergling

BRD farming. There are YouTube videos of it.

I was given 100g, by the person who convinced me to get into wow.  I basically squandered it really early, like level 15 buying bank slots and huge brown bags from the vendor that were like 6g each.  Traveler's Backpacks were super cheap on the AH.  He wasn't too happy when I hit him up for more gold for a mount/riding.

How worth and time consuming will an alt be? Is it worth it? If yes My man! :D

&gt;Which version of AV will we get?

To be honest, you can kill Ony with 10 people whether she has Conflag or not. Just don't stand together ???
---
Then hes fucked, not everything can be fair.
---
As far as I’m concerned, hunters have prio on ranged just as wars/rogues have prio on melee.
---
I'm well aware, but I'm following the server format listed in the OP above. It doesn't list PvE as an option and instead lists it as "Nomal" which I'm guessing is a misspelling of "normal". Hence my usage of it.
---
I'm pretty much playing osrs till classic releases,it's worth a shot to atleast try classic.
---
Double IPAs and papa johns pizza.

I'll buy that argument for the epic mount but for the 60% one that you're just gonna replace anyway, yeah nah. I'll take the free one. Unless you're a 49 twink or something.
---
Struggling to find a non-euphemistic way to say "anything that didn't make the keyboard sticky".

Played a hunter as my first character.  Never fed them and wondered why they kept running away.  Just thought it was normal and would train another.

Didn’t know about pet skill points until well after 40...

Didn’t know I could wear mail after 40...

Yes? But it costs mana, which is the most valuable resource while leveling.
---
I think the point was more about the type of content rather than the quality. Flooding the subreddit with art would be a shame in my opinion. That’s what /r/wow is for (or has become..).
---
Because wasting resources makes so much sense?
---
Someone ought to make the chef variant in a cutscene, maybe in Reforged.
---
Bitch we don’t even have a game to play
---
I know sharding worries people. And I was one of those people. I can see the need, and agree with it being used in starting areas. My worry came from them using it in other places too. Like the capital cities. BUT, blizzard has earned back a bit of my trust recently. Because of the blue post about changing the patch roll out schedule, and how they listened to the community and what they wanted. I'm willing to cut them a bit of slack and roll with sharding in the early zones.
---
OP was talking about gold not mana,don't warlocks also have life tap and drain life? Or did those spells come in a later patch?
---
Actually, you can filter out all the art - it's trivial to do so, for just about any app or method that you use to hit the subreddit.
---
We do a lot of in-depth analysis about the sorts of things that we see on r/wow and the Fluff Principle, which you can read about here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowmeta/comments/apbg8m/the_front_page_and_the_fluff_principle/
---
As you can see, art makes up less than 7% of all posts on r/wow, so claiming that the subreddit is flooded with art is patently ridiculous.
---
I thought feign death "worked" on players and got MAD when they killed me anyway. My friend convinced me for a few seconds that the warlocks void walker could steal your own loot at random.
---
I used "need" on every item in deadmines because I missunderstood the concept lol.
---
I once payed a 1g COD box sent from a random dude stating that the box contained a good weapon. It did not. And that 1 Gold was my entire savings /sadface
---
And when u reach aq or naxx with only one tank having accuria... your progression goes to shit.  Mt always gets first accuria.  You can give the next ring to a dps, but i would prefer the best 3 or 4 tanks getting the ring first so your overall raid dps increases.  So what... if a fury gets more hit earlyon... he wont be able to use it fully because he has to hold off on threat.  Warlocks have to constantly hold back on dps during bwl.
---
I probably ran UD Strat 100+ times and never saw the mount drop, let alone anybody on my server with it. 
---
Around TBC or Wrath I farmed out the oozing and that took me three solid days at 6-8 hr each, grinding oozes in a cave in WPL
---
The dragon whelpings took about a day each to grind except the green one which I didn’t get till later.
---
sorry, i should have been more considerate to your emotions.
---
I was guilty of this in my first few runs. Took a while before someone had the patience to explain it to me like i was 5.
---
Stop trying to be an elitist and humble yourself, at least until you know the basics of theorycrafting.
---
All you have to put into calculations is that he's alliance and has access to a Thrash Blade. You can't claim to know how much +hit he would need for Thrash Blade to be better than INSERT_UNKNOWN_2H_HERE. Thrash Blade is a competitive weapon in many configurations.
---
Alliance warriors can easily have higher dps with DW than 2H before BWL farming and you can easily have higher DPS with 2H despite having BWL on farm status. The fact that you think warrior gearing is so static tells me you probably didn't play warrior if you even played vanilla at all.
---
The other alternative is that you and your guild is fine with you underperforming because you picked a garbage staff as a quest reward to level faster. I don't think you remember how little loot is distributed among one of the most populated classes in the game back in vanilla, assuming you even base your opinion on experience.
---
Scholomance was changed because Blizzard did not realize the amount of trash that was spawned in the instance (it was a mistake).  
---
Because of the incorrect spawning, Scholomance pre-1.6 took roughly 7-8 hours, and groups rarely finished the entire dungeon.
---
Sure, there's always a chance but do we want to risk sullying Classic for an expansion. Isn't that retail?
---
You will likely have a surplus of linen cloth while leveling but after then you will be starved with every cloth thereafter and would be forced to grind mobs for cloth - a lot of time, very little experience. As for enchanting - it needs even more mats funneling that tailoring and it in general doesn't make money until pre-raid/raid enchanting starts or mana/wizard oils much later into the game. There is a wand market early on but that can be flooded with the help of mining and engineering (DE green guns). Early linen bags will also be flooded and problematic to sell on AH due to high action fee due to high vendor value (and that's the most highlighted item in any guide or tutorial so undercutting and quantities will be wild).
---
Amounts of mats needed are usually the case why crafting professions are quite often left until 60 or close to that. Some just level with skinning only, while others try to match second profession with what they want to go endgame - like herbalism for alchemy and stash herbs on a bank alt. Toon wanting to go tailoring/enchanting should either be able to mass farm humanoids (mostly mage, but also some other classes, even HPala on undead) or farm elites or alike mobs that drop a blue that DEs into large brilliant shard and alike. You could go skinning/mining, stash mining, vendor skins, then get engineering temporarily to craft as much green guns as possible, then drop it for tailoring/enchanting. DE guns, process stashed cloth and DE greens that come with that. Use DE mats from both sources to kickstart enchanting. By then you will have to start farming rare recipes and rep as aside of big bags you will need rare recipes to get those crafting/enchanting fees. Plus raid recipes, especially being one of the first on the realm/faction.
---
And in the end it may turn out that like mining and or herbalism are most fun and profitable. Bars do sell, but arcane crystals really do sell. Raid specific herbs will also be in high demand. You can even make money fishing or farming cloth/stuff from mobs too if your class is good at it.
---
If you want interactive professions - don't go Tailoring/Enchanting. If you want a macro/luxury economy and can supply it with mats/recipes then go ahead and do so.
---
I don't like new level caps because of what they do to content that was at the old level cap. When TBC came out all the progress you made in vanilla was instantly made useless. The same happened in future expansions but it got even worse. It's not just past expansions that become useless. Even past raid tiers are now obsolete the moment a new raid tier comes out. I don't want to see the same thing happen in WoW2. New content shouldn't overwrite a near equal amount of old content. That's how you end up with a 14-year-old game with only 6 months of relevant content.
---
And Vanilla WoW is nowhere near being overconcentrated with content yet. There's still no tier sets for the majority of specs and there are only 3 Legendary weapons for raid groups to work towards.
---
It kind of does have something to do with running ads though? Are you dense? Tips videos are low effort clickbait that he monetizes. A shitpost on Reddit has nothing to gain other than a laugh. (At the expense of you apparently.)
---
Not exactly what OP is talking about, hope they address the issue of raids not being as hard as they were intended to be due to the use of 1.12.1 classes, mechanics, extra debuff slots, item stats and so forth. Like I'm not looking for uber hard MC or anything like that, I just want to see things be similar to how they were back then. So far Blizzard hasn't really gave an explicit answer on the subject, other than they'd prefer not to alter things.
---
I remember when dungeons took upwards of 2 hours with BRD being the single greatest dungeon in any MMO in my opinion. It tells a story, it has multiple quests within it, the loot is extraordinary, unique mechanics like the forge encourage revisits, and it ties thematically with the rest of Black Rock Mountain. This is THE reason I cannot wait to get back in.
---
You have to stare at this character for /days, regardless if you PVP or PVE. You have to level with this character. You have to gear with this character.
---
If you *want* to play a dwarf, play a dwarf. If you have skill and gear, you'll beat almost all of your opponents in fair fight PVP. Don't spend 300 hours of your life grinding a toon so you can have an on-paper advantage for 2 minutes.
---
I started playing in wrath when i was about 20, so....beer/booze for me &gt;.&gt;
---
You have to understand though, relative to MMOs at the time, being able to look into the chaotic action was a 100% new and ground breaking experience.
---
Back in the old MMOs you raiding face to wall to avoid lag!
---
Make the swamps of sorrow great again?  I already built 6 farms, and since only a fool would leave his treasure unguarded, I also constructed a barracks for their defense!
---
I don't know why but I really love this comment lmao
---
AFAIK it's either highly unlikely or it's not supposed to be that more than 1 Seal of Command can proc on a full stack of reckoning, but I have seen two Seal of Command procs before while playing on Private Server so I'm not quite sure. All of the attacks can crit.   
---
Once you get later into Vanilla and have a little more spellpower, it might be better to use Seal of Righteousness because SoR will proc off of every hit and the total amount of damage is going to be close to that of a Seal of Command crit. On top of that each SoR proc and white hit has a chance to proc other on-hit effects, so it's pretty cool!  
---
I wish be could, but no can't get 5 Command procs in 1 swing unfortunately haha, but you can do a lot damage with righteousness and on-hit effects!
---
He was talking about gold, asserting he had tonnes of it because he didn't have to buy his mount and I merely told him he DID have to buy it.
---
They do have life tap and drain life, but what does that matter?
---
The point using the warlock mount is an extreme waste of resources, either directly mana, indirectly life and time, when you could simply buy the mount and avoid all of that.
---
The reason /r/wow is almost exclusively news, art, screenshots, and memes is because there's not much else to post there. There are many other specialized sub communities that are better for discussion.
---
It is technically optimal to use a normal mount which costs 0 mana instead of 100 (and you can't be silenced out of it, it doesn't stop your mana regen etc). But the difference is pretty dang minor and you're going to replace your level 40 mount anyway.
---
His argument holds some water of you're leveling an alt and the 90g is no problem. For a first character, the claim that you "need" to buy the normal mount is nonsense.
---
Gah, I'm like 90 % sure I'm going shaman. The only things holding me back are respec costs between pvp/pve, lack of fear optimization, and totem management. 
---
Other classes I'm considering are mage, priest, lock, and rogue.
---
“I thought about trying to 1-60 in a play session or two but its highly unlikely - even with routes and shit planned ahead.”
---
I’d say it’s honestly impossible. Unless your play sessions are, at minimum, 2 days of straight playing, no sleep. Which would be insane, and not healthy, and that’d still be an extremely fast pace. 
---
2-3 weeks is doable but still in the top 5% I would think.
---
A true Ret Paladin.. Only rank of Holy Light and Flash of Light is in the top right hotbar slot.. /salute  
---
lol :D
---
Ret. Once you're high-enough level, you can spec enough points into Holy to get consecration, but don't level as Holy or Prot unless you really want to slow down an already glacial leveling experience.
---
I agree with you,I would rather have a free lock/pally mount and have gold left over for my 60 mount.
---
I found I had this experience best during a brief period of time in the game when honor was just released, but prior to battlegrounds being released.
---
In some ways it probably made the world way to chaotic for those not interested in PvP, but the world PvP was spontaneous and chaotic, and it was always fun watching a small skirmish turn into an all out war zone as more players showed up.
---
Elevator outside RFK, boats, zeppelins, BRM chain, etc.
---
Old content won’t be useless because they will have their own servers. When TBC comes out, you’ll simply transfer characters that you want to progress with.
---
If you are thinking that you might get bored with Druid, I guarantee you will get bored with Mage. Your optimal PvE rotation is literally 1 button (frostbolt) with pre-created different ranks of Mana gems and mana potions weaved between and the occassional cooldown to pop. The hardest part of raiding is using your cooldowns properly on AOE packs to maximize your dps on the meters so you can get 10th place behind the rogues and furies anyways since they ALSO have good aoe haha. 
---
As a Druid you actually have a much more dynamic playstyle since you will be healing in a raid and you can use different ranks of heals to "snipe" heals off others and beat them on the meters. Paladins and priests of equal skill will usually still beat you, but at least there IS a skill element to it rather than mostly gear while targeting 1 boss and pressing 1 button.
---
If you are looking for an interesting class I suggest the Fury Warrior as that is the highest skillcap and most interesting rotation with dynamic choices depending on what happens like Overpower Procs vs how much rage you have left, deciding if a stance swap is worth it based on your flurry stacks dropping off, timing cooldowns around your Crusader procs on your weapons, etc etc.
---
All of this comment was based only on the "bored" comment up top -- so if you think Mage would be interesting then by all means go for it, they pick up well later on towards the end of progression raiding, and the PvP side of it is very fun with a high skillcap especially once you add in engineering trinkets. You can also farm gold incredibly well on a mage which is a huge bonus.
---
Check the vendor again. You can buy them back. /s
---
Anyone else worried that because it’s not new content, the game won’t be the same?
---
That is why we like it, because it is not new, its the game we love without changes made to it, you want new ? Then retail tells a good story.
---
With tailoring you'll spend a lot of time AFK waiting for the 10 "whatever is giving me points right now" to craft when each has a 1 minute crafting time.
---
That's what I don't understand. If you add expacs, you no longer have classic. But if you create actual expac servers, you'd have to level new characters again for each expac, never being able to keep that connection to your characters. I'm not arguing for/against either point, I'm just very curious what is going to happen and how.
---
First character I got to max was a shaman. I didn't get my totems till like level 40 because I'm stupid lol.
---
On my very first character, I rolled a gnome and wanted to visit Stormwind. I didn't know there was a fucking tram to get to SW so I ran, and kept dying over and over in wetlands. I then had a genius idea to just run as a dead body to a graveyard near SW! I was in for a rude awakening...
---
The classic "Oh my god I'm an Idiot" for me, right clicking as fast as I could thinking I attack faster.
---
Enchanting is a waste of time unless you stick with it, get the rare recipes from dungeons, raids, and reputation grinding, and hang out in your capitol city advertising your services and enchanting items for people.
---
There are no vellums, you cannot sell your enchantments on the auction house. You need to enchant items through the trade window. It is a very social process compared to retail.
---
If you are your guild's primary enchanter and your craft is being subsidized by your guild then you don't need to be as active about selling enchants in town.
---
Hello! Is there any french guild that already looking for player for wow classic? :)
---
Interesting. So like trinkets such as hand of justice can proc off all the hits.  Further increasing the amount of swings lol. 
---
It’s really too bad that reckoning only works off being crit. If they tweaked it to proc off of your own crits Ret could be really competitive dps.
---
I would start planning out bag space now to make sure you even have enough to hold them all.
---
Post naxx content is the only way i see this game going forward. If they decide to give an optional switch to tbc servers it will split an already small community more. Look at the success of Old School Runescape. This game was founded on the principles that the original design philosophy was better and when new content is released it is not only voted on, but kept in the spirit of the original game. If you simply want the game to stay the same forever, I think you are blinded by nostalgia. The game has to grow eventually if it wants to keep a player base worth keeping. New content following the old design philosophy would be a welcome addition in my eyes.
---
\-Instant Quest Text wasn't turned on for first 30 or so levels
---
\-Thought Tanks were actual tanks in game
---
\-Didn't understand the concept of Flightmasters
---
Lets circle jerk on my grammar skills. More relevant than 90% of the content here atm.
---
To follow up on Askyl post, not sure if you've ever moderated or GM'ed in a video game before, but sometimes there legit isnt anything to do and youre just waiting for shit to hit the fan, and during those times youre usually allowed to fuck about, especially if its going to generate positive experiences for the player.
---
Youre not just paid to fight fires, youre paid to make sure that the game is appealing to the playerbase - and yes that means you will be minimising problems most of the time - so youre still delivering value for money if you help make players happy/improve player retention.
---
I'm not sure if you're disagreeing with the thread claim or not but, it is exactly my point personally.
---
Much better than 1.12. Its gonna be harder, less overall damage and finally arms warriors are viable in raids again, for both factions.
---
Never played vanilla and only started playing WoW during Legion. Conflicted between Gnome Warlock, Dwarf Priest, or Gnome Mage for BGs&gt;Raiding&gt;WPvP in that order. Based off what I’ve read, it seems like Mage brings a lot more to the table than Locks, but Locks seem more interesting than Frost Bolt spam. With Priests, having the option to go heals is appealing. I was originally intending on playing Holy Pally due to their apparent strength in BGs, but after trying them out I found that they are just about the most poorly designed class in an MMO I’ve ever played.
---
The problem with several of those options is that it sends us down the same path we've already been.  Even *if* the new content is wonderful and perfect and absolutely in keeping with the spirit of Vanilla.  If we go down that road, then what will the game look like 5 years from launch?  10?  You all know as well as I do there will people right back to saying *"Man, I really miss the days when Naxx was the endgame and we didn't have people running around in Grim Batol gear!"*  And then there'd also be people saying stuff like *"Hey, with Grim Batol and Hyjal raids coming out, why not use this new vanilla content as a way to release gear optimized for specs like Boomkin and ret?"*
---
Even if, on paper, all of this new stuff is wonderful and amazing and very Vanilla-like, *it will still fundamentally change the game.*  And then you have a fragmented community of people playing "Classic+" and other people back to asking for "Classic-Classic" and yet another crowd who's still playing Retail.  It's just too fragmented and messy.
---
Don't get me wrong... I actually like the idea of post-nax content.  Truly, I think it's intriguing as all hell!  But I also thought the point of this whole exercise was to give people back the game they loved, with the promise not take it away this time.  Unless they split the players into "Classic" and "Classic+" servers from the very beginning, I kind of see this as them going back on that promise no matter how well-intentioned it is.
---
These were the two classes I played in vanilla. 
---
Honestly, like Bearrrr says, mage can be REALLY boring.
---
Personally, I've always had an absolute blast with druid. If you didn't try boomkin in classic, maybe give that a shot, it's honestly not that bad. Though I wouldn't recommend leveling as balance (...although I did actually. It was honestly kind of fun since with the gear I had I could still heal pretty decently in dungeons. It's true what people say though, I was OOM constantly).
---
Yeah, gotta have a few words with the vendors after classic release :)
---
No, literally zero chance.
---
It'd be a shame if someone were to PROPERLY enforce those two rules.
---
This one physically hurt me
---
Lots of boss don't even hit hard, even in naxx some are just hitting you for 2k damage. Even a properly geared and buffed bear could take 3 crit in a row on such boss without dying.
---
On some bosses, bear are actually better for taking the damage (resists fight like geddon ragnaros firemaw, patchewerk hateful strike tanking, bloodlord lashlayer).
---
I'm not saying bear should tank every boss (because tanking the hardest hitting one are a bad idea, through even on those a bear could probably try to get the second highest threat to get the boss in case something goes bad and mt die because bear can still get decent threat without being hit). But bringing a bear in your raid often bring more benefit than having none.
---
&gt;Blizz would be having to manage so many different games
---
Not really though, the way they are reworking Classic it will make it very low maintenance and the tough part is the initial getting it up and running. Once that happens features can be turned on or off per virtualized server.
---
Lol I never stopped world PvP. Killing people who only enjoy pve makes it even more fun for me. Shit even some of my own faction got mad at me and my pact for ganking outside of MC. I can't myself being heavy into pve once that high warlord grind comes
---
GMs were like elves among men; elusive, enigmatic, usually altruistic but also mischievous. You never knew what you'd get when you interacted with one but it was usually a memorable experience.
---
But the heart of man is corrupt and eventually we drove those gentle spirits back into the woods. Thought gone forever, they wait, watching us, wondering if we have learned from our mistakes. I hope we see the GMs again, and I hope that we allow them to live peaceably among us once more.

Sunflower seeds and energy drinks, specifically [Blue Agave Full Throttle](https://www.amazon.com/16-Pack-Throttle-Energy-Drink/dp/B0026WG9LE).
---
I might order a pack of them for Classic's launch...
---
You might do all 3.  Some people get desperate for tanks doing DeadMines and Stockades, but after Stockades It gets pretty hard to tank reliably as a pally without prot talents. 
---
Healing you can get away with doing for a lot longer time without needing healing talents, but around lvl 40 is when it really helps to have healing talents.

What if they launched a completely new 60-70 expansion 🤔🤔🤔
---
I prefer having a twitch stream open, or a podcast.
---
They already said they would work off of 1.12 balance issues.
---
&gt; Say I'm a Retail-only player that wants to play Classic. I'm curious whether my knowledge of the sub-60 dungeons will be applicable when Classic hits. 
---
It won't be applicable even in the slightest.
---
Retail 1-60 and Classic 1-60 are completely different games.
---
Yup. Stumbled upon a player *Tämäonvirtsa* there
---
But do you really think you like classic just because it’s not new? 
---
That’s not why I like it. I like it because if game mechanics, atmosphere, progression, rewards, and overall experience. 
---
The reason I don’t like the xpacs, especially newer content, is not because it’s simiply “new” but because the game changed.
---
Imagine a world of Warcraft xpac exactly like vanilla (down to the little things) except a new world to unpack. You saying you aren’t Interested?
---
Yeah bro I got back problems wtf you tryin to do to me OP?
---
Blizzard stated they don't have *any data* prior to 1.12, if that's true it means they *can't* give us older stuff, even if they wanted to.
---
The logistic issue is that while Paladins *can* tank all 5 mans, Druids and Warriors can do it better. They simply have more tools at their disposal to hold threat, gain threat, and recover from hiccups.
---
As for polls, make no mistake that the majority of players will roll warriors, but only a minority of them want to tank. There will always be a tank shortage for dungeon running, which you say you want to do. If that's *really* your interest, then pick any of the three tank classes and enjoy yourself.
---
If you think you'll want to do 40 man raids later, but you also want to switch it up when the needs call for it, roll druid or paladin.
---
If you'd rather have a tank/dps hybrid, roll warrior.
---
If you really like the idea of a holy warrior (and it is pretty bad-ass), go ret.
---
Just play the role you want, don't worry about anything else.
---
During vanilly launch did addons exists?
---
I think I've said this elsewhere, but on my first toon I had Herbalism somewhere over 200 before I realized that you could see herbs on the mini-map.
---
OP
---
I think everyone did that back then.
---
Another convert!
---
The Horde will never be short on rations again!
---
It's not that I don't want new content post Naxx, it's just that I'm 100% sure it's not going to happen, it's just WAY too easy, and WAY too cheap for Blizz to launch TBC, and we've all seen the way Acti/Blizz is trending.
---
Thinking of going dungeon tank shaman. I really like trolls because they're racials &amp; lack of popularity, but every time I hear shaman, people say to go troll. 
---
Tauren are probably going to be less popular due to min-maxing in Classic versus Vanilla. Would this be a better option for tank shaman? I mean, War Stomp &amp; the extra health could be very useful. I'm such a sucker for unpopular though. Maybe I think I'm edgy or something.
---
It could be in the form of dungeon layout, boss mechanics, etc while levelling from 1-60. Some of the bosses are unchanged on retail, some have new mechanics or are downright just removed. Like Scarlet Monastery has gotten some big changes, like Herod spinning up/down the stairs etc, while back in vanilla he just followed a random focused target (or the tank? I can't remember.. which is exactly the reason that would've been a good post to keep open)
---
I personally will trust the judgment of a multi million dollar company
---
My d&amp;d friend who played a warlock talked about how their warlock wore leather and since i knew other classes could upgrade their armor my first toon was a warlock with skinning/lwing. once i realized the truth i was only something like level 10 so i dropped lwing and got tailoring.
---
I remember starting my first character here and thinking it was a gorgeous place to start.
---
I've never mained a priest before, but I found I did enjoy healing as a druid and it sounds like priests are even better at that. I could use a bit of encouragement from people who've played priests though. Anything I should especially know about there? The "life at 60" priest thread is honestly a huge help as far as a source of encouragement. The attitude in that thread is completely different from the other class threads in an awesome way. But it's got a bit stale so was hoping to get some new insight. 
---
I've mostly played druid before, also mage (to 60 in vanilla) and warlock (to 40 in vanilla). Plus a bit of warrior (till 29 in vanilla) and later a bit of DK and Monk. There's a part of me that wants to roll a class that can tank, but the options in classic for tanking seem pretty limited.
---
This was me on my mage in Ungoro.  I had no clue about the epic hunter quest, I just saw a hunter about to die from a unknown mob and 'assisted' him.  He wasn't all that mad, and he did thank me, because he didn't die, but his pet was dead and he had about 1/4 of his life left.  When I asked later, I was called a 'NOOB OF EPIC PROPORTIONS' a title that I relish to this day.  :)
---
How about Titanic Leggings?
---
I miss Warcraft 3
---
I need to get a laptop ASAP 
---
I loved playing the campaign and going against the CPU over and over for days 1v1 as a kid 
---
“We need more Gold”
---
It'll happen in classic wow
---
Interesting! Didnt even know mining was a skill in WoW. I think PvP will be more of what my friends are going for. Is the PvP skill ceiling high or can new players jump into it with relative ease?
---
I agree. This was the best period of world pvp. BGs and instanced pvp ruin world pvp. I can't wait for more fights in un gore, azshara, plaque lands etc.
---
If we were going to get progressive talents they would have told us already. Having progressive talents would have huge ramifications for every player's experience of the game. It would make their update to the phases of Vanilla look like a trivial footnote by comparison.
---
Try doing it when all you have is the raid group add-on, before decursive was written.  Talk about whack-a-mole.
---
I think it would be interesting if much of Northrend was balanced around being done by a group, to keep the spectacle creep in check. The Northrend undead should feel more threatening than the Eastern Plaguelands undead. One person should not be able to single-handedly clear out a Scourge Necropolis. Taking down an undead dragon should not be a 3-person job.
---
Fun read, man. I look forward to the next one. I’ll be binge watching Stargate SG-1, though Samantha Carter rarely wesrs a sexy dress, she gets me where I need to go.
---
Count Dooku?
---
yes, quite normal in vanilla IIRC
---
I never understood why they needed to add new continents. Look what they did to silithus for AQ. Add a raid entrance, redo an area, or maybe add a small island with an entrance. There were so many zones and more than enough space in them. One of the biggest problems with retail is there's too many zones and most of the are dead.
---
there’s literally evidence everywhere. Even i saw a GM in Retail on Alleria way back in the day a couple of times. Just go google the shit, there’s all kinds of evidence of GMs in Vanilla.
---
I'm primarily focused on early (20-40) WPvP, and will likely spend all of Phase 1 engaged in this activity. I'm definitely going Undead Rogue, but I'm still undecided on profession. Engineering gives goggles, bombs and other cool PvP items, whereas Alchemy is more profitable (and generally easier to level) and gives healing potions, a truly crucial WPvP tool. I would be surprised if I made it to 60 before Phase 2, so endgame is of no real concern to me. Does anyone have any strong arguments in favor of either Engineering or Alchemy?
---
I thought July 16 was the running theory.
---
I genuinely don't think I did anything wrong when it came to the game other than being a socially inept 9 to 15 year old. I always tended to look things up as I knew about Thottbot and was on the forums almost more than I played the game.
---
(Side note - genuinely fuck the forum redesigns from Mists - onwards)
---
Is dungeon experience slower than solo grinding for paladin?
---
I don't think a new raid tier well after naxx inherently clashes with the idea of classic. However, I don't trust blizzard to be able to create one in the true spirit of it...
---
Mango servers were built with a mix of Vanilla and TBC data. A massive amount of data that affected Vanilla was CHANGED in TBC, to be more ACCESSIBLE (read : easier) to new players. And that modified values in TBC were applied to ALL NPC's in Vanilla, when TBC went live...INCLUDING raid bosses armor values, spell resists, critical hit chance of bosses...and I think (I am not sure tho) that crushing blows were removed in TBC.
---
Druid tanks, for example,  on private servers don't get crit too often and don't get crushed too often. In Vanilla, Druid tanks were, VERY OFTEN, killed in 2 or 3 hits by most bosses, usually receiving double crits and a crushing blow in a row. And that happened A LOT.
---
Fury Warriors, the same. On private servers they get far less damage compared to Vanilla. A TF wielding Fury Warrior in my guild attempted, A LOT OF TIMES. His threat was exceptional (as you can imagine), but his HP bar was jumping up and down like a Manila hooker jumping fences, running from pimps.
---
Private server meta (Druid and Fury Warriors as raid tanks) will NOT be in Classic.
---
If you don't listen to let the bodies hit the floor for PvP do you even play classic bro?
---
Never gonna happen and it's a good thing. 70 percent of the population would be mages and rogues and they are already stupidly popular in 1.12. Warlocks were also a meme in 1.1.
---
My first toon was a Warlock and I didn't know that you had to level your Voidwalkers abilities. So at around Level 23 I still had torment level 1. Naturally, I kept dying. After a certain period of time (aka about 25 deaths without ever killing anything anymore) I switched to a hunter. Then I noticed that there were pet trainers. Switched to my Warlock, they had it too.
---
Sure it would be "fun" to get continuation of vanilla, but that would made all the lore they done after obsolete. I mean how do you continue vanilla and its lore without adding or changing what has already been done or happened ?
---
O_o?
---
It absolutely did not. 1.12 had all the content released, people had been on the server collecting gear for years, there was at least a case to be made for the nerfed state of older content to move people through progression faster. 1.12 mechanics and tuning with only MC and Ony as content is a whole unique situation to Classic. That's why everybody is so hyped about 1.10 itemization being in it's own phase, because people are aware of the effect this had on raid progression.
---
Think before you post.
---
I played 3 different betas (EU, US and Korean with some tricks) before release, and I knew about talents because an older friend told me about them and what to spec. A few months later the game releases and I had forgotten everything about talents and didn't realize it until I was level 32. As a Warrior.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=after+vanilla&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
---
Correct Answer ^
---
World PvP rogues have the advantage because you are usually solo and they can pick their battles and they can abuse Cooldowns and engi gadgets to pull off amazing 1vX plays against multiple enemies. Warriors are sitting ducks in a lot of 1v1s depending on gear level and who gets the drop on who.
---
Meanwhile, in BGs, its the opposite. Warriors actually do not suffer from the problems you described unless they are solo. If you have a good paladin or two healing you, warriors become an unstoppable juggernaut with blessing of freedom, plate armor, charge and intercepts to move around the battlefield often and lots of short cooldowns on those. Whereas rogues are squishier and worse for getting healbotted, they also have no gap closers outside of a several minute cooldown on sprint and once they blow all their big 5 min cooldowns and 10min prep to reset them they are much less effective in sustained group pvp.
---
Still fun to pick off weak people in the back, if you are a dagger rogue, but warrior PvP is amazing in a group setting (I have played both extensively)
---
Your call basically, depending on if you like 1v1 dueling and world PvP, or if you prefer to play in a group setting 15v15 and kill 10 people back to back wrecking ball style.
---
Young hunter... I tried to get into many RFC groups as a healer. Because I had First Aid. I was confused why people wouldn't invite me.
---
Eating and drinking at the same time
---
The fact you don't get some patterns at launch because they drop in content released later is *not* progression in itemization, just staggered content release, itemization is still 1.12, some things are just released later.
---
I didn't know about the tram at all and wanted to go to IF (level 20ish human warrior). I tried the same route. Eventually hearthed after a couple of hours of corpse runs. Asked friends the next day and they showed me the way.
---
But the character I transfer over, it doesn't matter if he's a fresh 60 or a Naxx veteran. All that extra work is still useless when you transfer. And for new players, they still only get one expansion's-worth of relevant content for their characters (if that).
---
I played vanilla all the way thru Naxx. Warriors were not the most populated class, by any means. (They are the most populated now in P servers) After AQ when they opened cross server transfers and we had to recruit warriors from other servers since there was nothing- even at the bottom of the barrel. Back then we had a DW fury warrior in MC / early BWL. He didn't start to shine til AQ40 doing more dps than anybody ever seen. Before then the hunters were doing more dmg than DW fury. 
---
Sounds like you got carried on a private server with all content/gear available
---
For Honor
---
Don't forget to play the Rexxar Campaign! :D
---
&gt;As it stands, healing is "mediocre" and while I enjoy the fantasy, I actually despise playing as feral.  I enjoyed balance/resto more.
---
Believe it or not, it's actually possible to level as balance in vanilla wow. I did it. I'm not saying it's easy, or efficient. It's neither of those things. But it is actually kind of fun. Plus, throughout leveling I never had a problem healing dungeons even while specced balance. Before 60 the balance gear works decently well for healing, and you can pick up the odd healing piece as you go as well. And then healing at 60 also really isn't so bad. If you have to be the best healer then go priest, but healing as druid is still fun frankly, or you can even go Boomkin, but then for sure you're going to have a harder time finding raids. 
---
All this to say, if your reason for not playing druid is because you think you'll be pigeon-holed into feral, that's just not true. There's definitely plenty of room for resto druids, and some room for boomkins too.
---
Everyone can jump in but skill, level and gear matters. Some classes have it easier than others. I found it to be very accessible once I knew what I can do and what others can do to me.
---
You can heal in ret as long as you have 2 sets of gear.
---
I argued with my brother, relentlessly, that Slice and Dice was *obviously* a dps loss because it didn't do any damage and Eviscerate did.
---
I raided with one of three guilds on my server killing bosses in Naxx...
---
Seems like the mods here are getting silly.
---
They did introduce that you'd remember your previous professions at a later point.
---
Yeah the totem system isn't for everybody, but if you look at a totem's group value per global spent, a totem probably has the highest value of any ability in the game. Try to see it from this perspective. How much damage to a boss would a windfury totem contribute versus a shadow bolt or frost bolt? Its hard to step away from the tangible output of a dps or hps meter, but if you can eliminate all of that noise and really look at what can contribute most to your dps and healing output, then you can fall in love with the Shaman, but it really is a support role that you can't meterflex with (I'm sure that will change with more advanced meters being adapted to Classic). Really what it comes down to is if you get more enjoyment out of hitting the top of the charts, or if you enjoying doing your best in the background. If you're not going to have fun without the internal competition, then it may not be for you.
---
Can't wait for the Remaster. Would be neat if it releases before Classic.
---
Well, they already said that we'll be playing with 1.12 talents etc...
---
So no 31 points in restoration for Innervate and such things that made the game even harder back then.
---
In my company we're not allowed to change background, through global and local policies.  
---
I have named my wallpaper like the default one, and I overwrote it.  
---
Problem solved!
---
Good =/= Designed well.
---
While it does sound awesome, the main reason I would be cautious about adding new level 60 content is that we would not be getting a faithful restoration of the design philosophy of 2004-2006, we would be getting content made by a different team with new ideas and arguably alternative priorities. Itemisation, quest design, writing, boss design, art assets, world changes: all would have to be made with Vanilla sensibilities in mind or it would not feel a part of Classic/Vanilla.
---
Personally I think it could spoil a good thing that people have wished for for years. My trust in Blizzard to keep Classic untouched by modern monetisation and conveniences hangs by a thread as it is.
---
That's not what I was trying to do. Did you even read my comment? I was asking because I can't figure out when they're supposed to be used.
---
It's literally right there in my comment. Why are you so ready to get offended? Inseucrity? Jesus man.
---
Now, now, now, did **you** write that post it about WoW Classic, or did someone write it for you?  
---
And it's that a plan for a vacation, or are you buying property?  
---
;)
---
Cheeze it's mostly. But I also chewed tobacco then so I didn't eat often. I dont chew tobacco anymore so extra time for cheese its
---
Wouldn't ret slow down my leveling since it might increase dungeon wait times
---
Played hunter, was a real huntard. 
---
-Prioritized armor over any other stat, leading to for example me selling all my green gear at lvl ~18 in loch modan and buying white gear with higher armor from the vendor. Also took the high armor mail pants from the gnomer quest instead of the +18 agi leather ones. 
---
-Also didn't reallize what talents were until about lvl ~35. My friend insisted on me checking it out and i was fed up with him pestering me about it so i clicked the talent icon and spammed points all over and told him to stfu about it now
---
-Generally regarded melee as equally important as ranged as a hunter. I would always look on the AH for high dps blue melee weapons i could buy. And in my first gnomer run i "ninjad" the toxic revenger, a blue lvl 27 dagger with no stats on it, from a rogue. Whole group rightfully got very angry at me, and while i didn't understand why, i paid the rogue 1g and said sorry. 
---
-Didn't know pets could learn "special abilities" out in the world from certain animals, that you couldn't learn from the beast trainer. So i went with a gimped pet with only growl all the way until 60.
---
I'm sure if someone noticed, they would have laughed, but then at least corrected you.
---
Good call!
---
Did that. Took my sweet time with the first act too to have an INSANELY buff team for the last two acts. I love just making Rokhan into an absolute beast. 
---
Pro tip to people doing this, the sooner you get Chen, the more fun you'll have. You can get him after like one quest too if you don't mind having to do a lot of save/exit when it comes to the phoenix egg (which I highly recommend getting as the last quest piece. The other two quest pieces aren't too bad at all).
---
I remember hunters trying that with me in BGs. Didn't take me long to figure out I could keep attacking them.
---
I ran around for 2 weeks before I realized there was an auto-run button.
---
fucking boomers..
---
Well if i play druid i will surely play boomkin since i want to test it badly in pvp. Yeah i didnt play classic that much at all so i am not even sure if i could get boring from druid, it's not the playstyle that would bore me but more of the class itself only seeing that druid all the time again, hard to explain not that fluent in english :D
---
For PvP dwarf is a lot better. For PvE it's a little difference. Go with dwarf :)
---
&gt; It was almost better to bring less people because of it 
---
It was ALWAYS better to do Ony with less than 40. My semi-hardcore guild killed Ony, for the first time, in 30 people.
---
It can be done in 40 and nobody will be fireballed...but there are always people who are dumb, or drunk, or not paying attention to simply fuck up an attempt.
---
Less people for Ony was ALWAYS better.
---
Smelted truesilver sometimes vendors for more than you can ah it
---
IMO, significantly. I've only really looked into the first 35 levels for dungeons, but at level 20 The Deadmines grants 10,000xp from mob kills, and takes about an hour to do, 10k xph  --- At 25 The Stockade can be done in 30 minutes, but grants 7,000xp, so about 14,000xp per hour.
---
Running around killing 2 level 20 mobs a minute for an hour at level 20 gives you 15,500. 19,000 at level 25 killing level 25s. Kill more / faster, and it scales up from there.
---
Solo grind is 30-50% faster baseline. If you can maintain 2.5 kills a minute, it's 70-90% faster.
---
Do a dungeon once, with all the quests if you want, especially if it has a good upgrade for you to maintain grinding speeds, but otherwise, pass.
---
I played Runescape back in the days before the GE and trade limits and I loved the game. The only game that took me away from RS during that time was vanilla wow. They are different games and have different pros and cons but they came from the same era of mmorpg’s so there is some similarities. Rather than skilling, where everyone has access to all skills, vanilla wow lets you choose 2 primary professions along with the 3 secondary professions that everyone has access to. This allows you to feel more defined in your crafting role than runescape imo. You can build up a reputation as a known enchanter or blacksmith on your realm for example. My suggestion is take engineering as a profession if you plan to pvp...it will help you in many many ways. 
---
Another thing that i really enjoyed when switching from RS to vanilla wow was that rather than being able to hop worlds, you are set in your chosen realm permanently. We dont know what the population cap will be in classic but in vanilla it was between 2500-3500. At first this might souns like a limitation compared to the freedom of osrs but in reality it allows for tight communities to form where it’s realistic to spontaneously run into the same player in the open world frequently during your leveling process. 
---
Overall my switch from RS to vanilla wow in  2005 was a very welcome new adventure and to this day i enjoy both games.
---
For what it's worth, I always absolutely loved the Mulgore experience, and coming back to Thunder Bluff always gave me chills. It was awesome to have this whole city away from the hustle and bustle of Orgrimmar.
---
Ultimately, I wouldn't let popularity affect your choice of race (although I won't go as far as making the same statement about class...) I'd say just follow your heart.
---
To be honest...stop playing on private servers or assume that 10 Naxx geared guys killing Ony is the norm.
---
Neither private servers, not 10 Naxx geared guys aren't the norm.
---
Played an Undead Rogue from Vanilla to WotLK when I quit, but might want to change it up a bit.  With a family now, my time is limited and I'll be focusing on PvP.  How viable are shamans in PVP?
---
I always do the Quests there. Its a few hours of brainless grinding with a few PvP Battles in between. I love it.
---
You became a 5 star man!
---
That's what's keeping me away from a pally as well. Honestly I should have probably played a pally in TBC/WoTLK I look at the state of pallies in vanilla, and the state of the game itself in retail, and I'm just totally turned off.
---
Is this true?
---
Gnomish or goblin engineering? Will play either rogue or warrior. PvP WPvP and instance/raids. Doing it all.
---
I will play on a rp-pvp server with the purpose to have fun.
---
Didn't so engineering in wow much, so have no clue which to pick :(
---
Understood. Im hoping there will be more video content for new players such as leveling tutorials/build guides/etc. when Classic finally releases. You know any good content creators for this kind of stuff?
---
Help me decide between Warlock, Hunter, and Shaman.
---
I'm looking for a class that can effectively PVE and PVP without having to respec, is good at range, and does not have a high gear dependence.  If you have a suggestion, please also include a race :)
---
&gt; Stargate SG-1
---
Hm... I think we need a new database of popular shows and their run times. BSG is only like 58 hours to binge. Gonna need something for another couple dozen hours afterward.
---
I dont think I've ever seen a stranger in shimmering flats and the server I played on had high population
---
&gt; No MC at launch.
---
Oops, I dropped this   ,
---
Still watching ...
---
is it worth it to take improved SoR for reckoning pvp?
---
You ate correct
---
Oof.
---
Those blackout procs tho
---
You seem to me obsessed with penis
---
Raiding on my rogue for the first 2 months in Sub spec
---
Try the class Discord channels.
---
Real advice here
---
That's an even worse spelling of Rogue than Rouge.
---
I understand. I'm in a similar spot actually. I've played druid since vanilla and feel like I've done everything there is to do as druid, but now that's the only class I'm comfortable with...
---
&gt; whatever pokes your holes.
---
don't yuck someone else's yum. :D
---
Good thing that you love collectibles.
---
But why do you want to do it in Classic? Do you understand how time consuming and gold consuming (which is also time consuming) such an activity will be in Classic?
---
And to be entirely honest...the changes for you to have all pets and mounts are basically zero. You will be stressing that Baron mount doesn't drop...and ONLY that single mount will require constant farming, ignoring everything else.
---
I don't know why you wanna do that, but man, you aim really high :)
---
Which is admirable.
---
It's just a pvp server.
---
No, you do not. I don't care what private servers "Show", they are false. As soon as cross-server BGs released I never made friends in a BG again and it felt like I was playing with npcs. I also very, very, VERY rarely play premades - and when I do, I don't even care, because it's some guild on some server I dind't even know exists.
---
 It was like night and day and hugely noticable.
---
/r/classic is now /r/wow which is now /r/ffxiv
---
Wow I actually thought the same thing. Bind on equip made me think of Ekans using bind in Pokémon red, so I thought it would be stuck on me. I remember equipping my first green with 2 agility thinking. “What have I done!?” Later, my friend told me what it actually meant. I was 12 at the time. 
---
That last one is the cutest thing I’ve ever heard.
---
I WANNA HEAL, I WANNA FEEL, WHAT I THOUGHT WAS NEVER REAL
---
First of all thank you for that detailed answer! 
---
I will take a look at Fury Warry, i just love high skillcap classes. 
---
Well since i am not that fluent in english i probably didnt mean boring in perspective of playstyle or rotation but rather being bored seeing one class all over again that i mained for so long. (In later expansions one just made an alt geared it relatively quick and you could take a break) From what you describe druid still seems to be fitting very well for me. 
---
In terms of pvp i think mage would be nice yeah - is fury that great too since i will mainly focus on that?
---
If you PvP as ele resto spec the 30/21 spec you can heal and BG in the same spec so no respeccing required. 
---
Optimisation will come with Dire Maul patch 2 or 3? Totem management is a pain!
---
Joana did 117 hours to 60 on his Hunter in 2006.  That is widely considered the record time to 60, and was with pretty decent route planning and practice.  Nevermind it wasn't on a fresh server with 1000's of players vying for the same quests.
---
I have no real point to make, just thought it was an interesting reference.  More or less 5 real time days /played, which is 10 real life days at 12hrs / day.  If you're planning to take time off work and want to hit 60 rightaway, would probably want to take at least 10 days.
---
It takes time to find a group
---
It takes time to gather all the quests for the dungeon
---
It takes time to get everyone to the dungeon
---
Not everyone knows the pulls, or how to play their class, or both. So you're likely going to wipe multiple times, which takes time.
---
Between the wipes and dungeons being somewhat long, it's not uncommon for people to bail half way through the run. Sometimes you can just 4 man, but that slows things down even more. Sometimes you have to look for a replacement which takes a lot of time...
---
Dungeons can be fun to do and can help break up the monotony of leveling, but unless you have a group of friends to do them with, they will almost always slow you down.
---
It does. You won't care because Druid forces maximized 5 second rule as you enter forms longer than 5 seconds usually, minus crazy pvp game play.
---
Did you calculate how many hours you'll need till 60 this way?
---
DM won't be out on classic release so you can't do the quest.
---
If you want to go really try-hard go Gnomish first, get all the gadgets and then abandon it. Level it up anew and pick Goblin. This lets you have all the neat things from Gnomish while still getting to craft the bombs in Goblin.
---
If this sounds like to much of a hassle just stick to Gnomish. It is in my opinion the more entertaining of the two.
---
Good luck with your adventures and may your devices never backfire!
---
Rolling need on strike of the hydra from BFD and getting beastslayer enchant on it. I was a hunter 
---
I'd still go like 13/13/25 or 21/x/24
---
My rogue I only intended to solo farm and pvp with, never to raid. 
---
If you want to raid, you're condemed to go combat daggers or combat swords, depending on what weapons you actually aquire more so than if you prefer swords over daggers or vice versa
---
That's too hard for kids today. They can't think for themselves.
---
If you're obsessed with min-maxing, healing might not be for you.  Healing meters are not a useful metric for who the "best" healers are, as healing is a much more cooperative than competitive role.
---
Healing is about preventing raid wipes.  Every class on it's own can bring the HPS required for a raid encounter, and the meters are a better ping indicator than skill.  Healing means using your cooldowns effectively, so if you still want to heal, I would recommend picking your class based on what they do besides spam their most efficient heal.  Here's a short list of cooldowns and situational spells that each healer brings to raids:
---
* Druid: innervate, rebirth, remove curse, cure poison, nature's swiftness, swiftmend, hibernate, shapeshifting (can tank in an oh-shit moment)
---
* Paladin: bubbles, lay on hands, turn undead, cleanse, auras.
---
* Priest: shadow weaving, mind control, power infusion, dispel magic, cure disease, shackle undead, fear ward\*
---
* Shaman: tremor totem, mana tide totem, windfury totem, tranquility totem, grounding totem, poison/disease cleansing totem, resistance totems, reincarnation, earth shock, purge
---
I leveled an enhancement shaman under the impression my main stat should be spirit. I also had a bunch of int and Dex and could barely beat regular mobs.
---
Started a mage after that and blazed through, became my main all through classic.
---
On one of the more-recent-but-not-most-recent private server launches, they delayed MC launch for a couple months.
---
By the time it came out, everyone was in full prebis and the instance was not interesting at all.  Everyone facerolled it.  Huge opportunity lost for anyone who cared about any kind of fresh server race or having a hard MC experience.
---
MC available at launch is fine.
---
Don't need to. Watch the Classic panel from Blizzcon. Devs admitted it was part of the game.
---
Are you guys really too childish and stubborn to wrap your head around the FACT that loot wasn't final in vanilla?
---
You're forgetting about the trained professionals who grind *on the way* to a quest area and then grind their way back.  In my opinion(without any math to back it up), you gird yourself against **needing** to grind in between quest droughts if you just develop a "If it's red, it's dead" mentality and kill every living thing on your way too and from quests.
---
If queue times are high open the flood gates to cross realm BGs.
---
Previous balance changes are irrelevant.
---
Classic will be balanced around itself. It is starting with 16 debuff slots and Blizzard is balancing the game around 1.12 and the changes they already adhere to.
---
People need to shift their expectations of what Classic is and how it's being developed.
---
Go look in the window behind golemagg to see Ragnaros!
---
I don't know if you played Vanilla, but unlike retail, you don't get stuck in a single role while leveling. Even after putting your first 10 points in ret, you can heal or tank the first few dungeons as long as you have a few pieces of healer or tank gear.
---
Once you reach level 30 or so, you'll find it difficult to tank dungeons without putting points in the prot tree. Regardless, while leveling, the majority of your points should be in the ret tree.
---
I'll probably have to see what my buddies are playin as well. Might be a hard decision lol
---
Agree! My biggest fear is that content will be too easy, give us the hardest version!
---
Stop trying so hard
---
Mechanics changes should mostly be code. Only things like hitpoints or damage must be in database.  Most of the changes op mentioned are mechanics.
---
&gt; Cross-server BGs, faction changes, server transfers and character renaming
---
Also against these, but loot trading is still the biggest problem imo. I could live with server transfers if they were limited to transferring from low pop servers.
---
Exactly. The idea that one could go 1-60 in "a play session or two" is absurd, given that point of comparison.   
---
You make a good point too about 1000s vying for same quests, I hadn't considered that part. 
---
&gt;How do you guys feel about this small window between release night and availability of raids?
---
No, thank you.  Just play the game at your own pace and don't worry so much about how others play it, imho.
---
So are you saying that if wait times are high to fill a dungeon then open the flood gates to LFD?
---
Why is this community so against LFD, trading community for convenience, but when it comes to BGS, it's 100% ok to do that? Makes no sense.
---
You could experiment with deleting a few columns of pixels from the centre to account for the monitor's bezel. As well as using the non logo versions and superimposing wow classic logos for the left/right monitors.
---
Yo I'm in a small casual guild that sounds pretty close to what you're looking for. If you're interested message me and I can refer you to the leader!
---
I couldn't. I would never make friends/rivalries if there were cross-server bgs while loot trading can randomly be "exploited" in content but not destroy the community aspect of the game.
---
I was a mage and I thought damage on the staff was better than INT for mages, so I sold the blue staff from deadmines to keep the staff of westfall because it had better damage.
---
Thank you and great input
---
I’m not sure if videos from private servers are allowed here homie.
---
I didn't knew that you can eat and drink at the same time until level 35 
---
&gt; All that extra work is still useless when you transfer
---
I guess I don't understand what you mean by extra work? I mean, by the time you move on from Molten Core to AQ, the work from Molten Core is "useless". All the leveling you did is "useless". The Vanilla Classic server would still be available, &amp; you can pick and choose what characters get transferred, IF you want to transfer them.
---
Go with tailoring for the Chest and take a gathering profession as second. I will go Tailoring/Herbalism and switch to Alchemy/Herbalism after making the Truefaith Vestments.

---
&gt;Not as many as those of you wanting to change Classic at its core.
---
If it bothers you so much, just don't play it? What an incredibly mind-boggling concept.
---
I won't disagree. TBC homogenized most of the classes, which means the dev team at the time thought the vanilla design needed to be changed to improve the game.
---
Help me decide between warrior and mage/warlock. 
---
I picked up wow at the end of Wrath and have been playing tank since hitting Max lvl in cata. I love tanking, but I am looking at how mage/lock get to fill some niche roles in the community and it has me really intrigued.
---
 Being able to teleport people as a mage, as well as conjure food and water seem really useful to me. 
---
Likewise, being able to summon people to raids and dungeons as well as battle res seems super helpful. 
---
My priorities are Raids/Dungeons &lt; Lvling experience &lt; BG. Knowing that what do you guys think.
---
&gt; I couldn't
---
Don't know how someone transferring from a virtually dead server impacts your friends and rivalries.
---
\*Your cooking skill has increased by 1\*
---
&gt; Though I don't think I'm the only one wanting more of a "classic" feel than just the final patch.
---
LOL, sure, blizz will read your "feelings" to program the perfect classic just for you.
---
Y'all are crazy AF. Dumb kids.
---
But what about the people who want to play Cata? Are we going to the massive hypocrites and tell them you think you do but you don't, and try to fight cata servers from being made?
---
I would also say that Vanilla is unique in the regard that it is the only version of WoW that is not playable on retail, 90% of the content from vanilla has either been reworked entirely, or remove. TBC and Wrath is still in the game.
---
My personal preference is obviously that TBC is just flat out worse than vanilla, and I despise wrath. I would hate to see the game go down the same route again, and rather have them keep working on vanilla, add site content based on un-used vanilla assets (which there are lots of), eventually remove the debuff cap (THE biggest hinder to class balance in vanilla) and just have one classic version of WoW, and one mobile gaming one.
---
Obviously Blizzard will have to decide, but if they do decide to not set a limit early then they will be stuck in a loop.
---
LEEEROOY  JENKIINSS
---
it is, the new server releases didn't launch with only MC/ony out and gated content like classic will, a fresh server released in 1.12 back in the day launched with naxx out
---
Agreed.  Also the 'average time to 60' that the Nostalrius team shared after ~6 months of server uptime was closer to about 10days /played.
---
Wish I had the infographic link handy, but I think you can find it on this sub with a little searching
---
Yeah I get what your saying I was just skeptical about putting the points into the more dps focused tree instead of healing and or tanking
---
My friend and I were two hunters, we attempted to solo gnomergon. I think we were a couple of levels under the gnomes. But I remember we killed two mobs and Feet of the Lynx dropped. We both rolled greed to sell it and I won! I was so excited, so I ran to ironforge, and typed in trade, “wts feet of the lynx 1G.” 
---
Yep I sold that twink item for 1G. I instantly got a whisper. I felt so rich after that, and got caught up on a couple spells. After playing classic again when I was older, idk how I never made it above one gold by that level.  
---
The massive difference between private servers and 1.12.1 is the logoff /camp option.
---
On private servers, you will be back at the entrance, in 1.12.1 you will be where you logged off. This difference alone make DM solo farming last twice as long. Which in turn will make the gold generated per hour drop in half, which will make DM solo farming not more profitable that ANY other farming method in 1.12.1
---
Biggest difference between a healer and dps is, if you take a 3 second lapse in judgement, tank dies and everyone is dead.
---
Mess up your (very minor) damage rotation as dps and you might kill a boss 2 seconds slower.
---
Being a healer is far more difficult and far more punishing to mistakes than DPS where you just have to know when to avoid incoming damage, when to dps, and master getting the most dps without generating too much threat.
---
A healer needs to be aware of threat (initially on a fight), boss mechanics, tank health, your own hp (and to a lesser extent your party), and dire management of your own mana.
---
Get ready to be yelled at constantly by terrible players taking totally unnecessary damage why you didn't heal them while trying to keep a tank alive.  
---
You'll learn to spite kill some particularly bad players by not healing them on purpose (i.e. that one mage or rogue who thinks he's hot shit).
---
Druids can farm frozen runes aswel..
---
I could not see if my frost bolt was slowing them or not, ended up deleting my mage and making a new one...
---
I was on a crappy pc and the setting were too low to see a distinct "blue" color change. 
---
I meant coals. Nvm.
---
Hilariously downvoted 
---
I always had to competete there and we always had PvP battles there. Its also in pretty much all leveling-guides.
---
WoW is a lot different to OSRS, but if you like OSRS, you'd probably prefer Classic wow over cataclysm for sure.
---
&gt;Druid tanks, for example, on private servers don't get crit too often and don't get crushed too often. In Vanilla, Druid tanks were, VERY OFTEN, killed in 2 or 3 hits by most bosses, usually receiving double crits and a crushing blow in a row. And that happened A LOT.
---
Dude, you don't know what you're talking about. The combat formulas didn't change from vanilla to TBC. Mangos-based servers are damn accurate with respect to tank mechanics. The difference on pservers is that players go in knowing the itemization and stats to make them effective. 
---
Also, prot warrior main tanks can definitely die in 3 hits on many bosses, if your gear doesn't exceed the content. Heals have to come in constantly. 
---
You do understand that Cross-server BGs, was introduced in 1.12 right ?  Server transfers was how they handled server population
---
I've spoken to a GM like twice. If speaking to them was part of your "vanilla experience", you were probably a whiny, 10 year old bitch.
---
&gt;They are releasing 1.12 exactly as it was over 10 years ago.
---
no they are not. if they did they'd have to release classic at the stage 6 of content release phase they got planned. There was no point in vanilla where patch 1.12 was out but also only MC/onyxia, for example. 
---
Im not saying anything about naxx players. Im saying you can kill ony with 10 ppl. It will take a very long time and not recommending it. Tell me what in Vanilla made this not true vs private servers. Just saying that this point doesnt really mean anything in the context of whether or not Ony does conflag. 
---
Because pve progression as a server and server members feel rewarding
---
And because pvp progression feels rewarding as a player but with cross realm, you could be best on your server like in vanilla but now you can compete against other players on your battle group servers
---
Battlegroups on PVE servers are fine imo, not on PVP servers though.
---
The eat and drink thing happened to me too. Friend of mine noticed it one day and made fun of me for hours. 
---
Just answer the question. Don't tell someone to care or not. F'ng rude.
---
you really shouldn't listen to that guy
---
Natures Grace in Balance and Improved Regrowth = 1.3s cast times on Regrowth with 5pc T2.  This is a very popular raid spec that allows Druids to output an insane amount.
---
Yes it's mana intensive but this can be alleviated with consumes
---
Sharding:  "thats fine, I totally understand has to do it \#nochanges"
---
Loot trading so Blizzard won't have to dive through tickets from people who accidentally clicked on need or gave the wrong loot through a missclick on ML:  "BLIZZARD WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING, THIS WILL TOTALLY RUIN THE FUCKING GAME!!!, LITEREALLY EVERY ITEM WILL BE NINJA LOOTED GG I QUIT! WHERE IS THE \#NOCHANGS?"
---
Obviously.
---
Barring travel time, 113:52:04 to 60 at 2 kills a minute. 91:05:39 at 2.5.
---
The path I have currently in mind has me in 1 zone, or neighboring zones for 10+ levels at a time, so travel is minimal. As a paladin, looting stuff for gold / 40 mount is less important, so I can trash junk rather than lose time to go back and dump bags too often.
---
Beneficial quests I might find along the way due to this math will only lower these numbers.
---
Yeah, I just read it as in the context of modern game releases, in which it was decent. Anthem for example makes it looks polished as hell. That’s not even considering it’s a 15ish year old game with a ridiculous amount of moving parts and legacy systems and code. Idk, I work in software and consistently see reddit entirely miss the mark on how the process works and prioritization of certain elements/bugs over others, and while I ultimate would wish for less bugs in that release, I understand there’s a lot more factors at play and ultimately you set a deadline and have to ship at some point, with the deadline being set often times long before some unforeseen issue crops up. While I don’t play right now, none of the bugs got in my way of playing at all, so I didn’t care at all really tbh. 
---
And hey, comments are fair game until the post is archived ;) I often go through top posts of the month, not exactly unusual
---
&gt; We should be focusing on Cross-server BGs
---
Is this the beginning of our Eternal September, r/classicwow? Where we get the newbies who have no idea how Vanilla actually worked? Where we get the endless posts that are dead wrong and **don't even realize that Cross-server BGs were a Vanilla feature?**
---
I love how he screen recorded with a video cam
---
Wasting resources like time on a warlock mount huh? You mean like the time wasted farming gold for a “proper” mount as you put it? Just let people have fun and play the game dude
---
lol no.
---
&gt; There's a reason *every private server* nerfs it. 
---
And that is GOLD SELLING, which injects FAR MORE gold into economy.
---
Private servers are so far from Vanilla...you need the Hubble to see how far they are.
---
Wow this is awesome to hear! You've honestly convinced me to at least try it out. Building reputation to be the best engineer on my server? Thats fucking sick. Also the camaraderie built between the other players in your server, priceless. 
---
I dont imagine anything good when I wonder 'what type of person manages a subreddit'
---
Awesome, thanks for the numbers and insights!
---
I mean shit, if you're having fun doing it...
---
Through the leveling process, isn't that the vast majority of gear because of quest rewards?
---
I agree with you. There is no need to avoid patching obvious problems with the game. The scariest thing about bringing back vanilla to me are the die-hards that want it to be 10000% accurate. I'd gladly trade off small changes and patches to the new version. It's not the imperfection that I want. I just want the community and hardcore play-style back, personally. 
---
I don't know. You'd need to ask them.
---
I always feel calm and chill playing a Tauren. 
---
Playing a Druid, I really enjoyed using all my forms. So naturally, I chose gear that increased all my stats equally, figuring health strength agility and int were all equally great for me as if often swap between casting and bear/cat. The literal opposite of min/maxing. 
---
Needless to say, leveling was a.... slow process ;)
---
*on pservers* no
---
For me it was always way better to spec holy reckoning for improved righteousness instead of Ret for command. 
---
Idk how classic will work but lll certainly be testing it 
---
Wow, I only made it to 25 in camp t on my warrior.  Couldn't kill anything anymore without dieing lol.
---
TBC is good, but its far, far worse than vanilla. Faction imbalance goes down the drain (80-90% horde per server inc), faction identity is obviously lost (A and H share capital in Outlands), Flying mounts, summoning stones, Outland is miniscule continent and everyone will always be in the same zone. Wpvp is awful in Outlands due to flying, and dailies are introduced.
---
TBC is easily the 2nd best version of WoW, but after playing on all of azeroth in vanilla, TBC sure does feel tiny in comparison, and the QoL changes are very notable.
---
And Wrath we might as well cancel classic lmao.
---
I was talking about in terms of itemization.
---
LOL. You think people arent going to sell gold in Classic? You think they didnt sell it in original vanilla? 
---
Wow I wonder how that's even possible
---
Leveling 1-39:
---
Fury - never dual-wielding, the inherent miss penalty will lower your dps and slow your kill rate. As an orc warrior, you will receive a blue staff reward from doing Wailing Caverns - it hits like a truck, equip it even if it looks awkward as a staff. You won't replace it for a while (the dps on it is retarded). Yes, train your staff skill for 10 silver if you haven't already. Rend and hamstring will be your greatest friends here.
---
Leveling 40-59:
---
Time to respec at 40 to Arms and bring out the big nasty Mortal Strike to your rotation. DPS increases considerably. 2H weapons only from here on out. Use pummel for your interrupts now and always. No more rend.
---
60
---
Time to respec again - pick your poison, in your case, protection spec. Early in vanilla, best spec will be high defensive 8/5/38 that you can modify based on current content. Raid 8/5/38 is different to 5-man Dungeon spam 8/5/38 for gearing your guildies (you will be tanking a lot). Imp Revenge is a good example of having high value in dungeons but would never be worth a talent point when you switch to MT raiding 8/5/38.
---
Side Notes: 
---
While leveling, always keep a sword and shield in your bags, that is all you need to tank any dungeon as fury (1-39) and arms (40-59). Pro-tip while solo leveling: even if your 2H hits harder, switch to 1H and shield for shield bash when fighting certain mobs with high dps cast attacks so you can interrupt them. They WILL melt you if you don't interrupt, slowing your leveling down considerably. Bring the harder-hitting 2H back out when you are done with those mob types. Also, healers will drive you nuts. If you are pro, use a weapon swap macro to time when you need to bash them and swap back to 2H.
---
Never ever bring another warrior with you as a dps when you are tanking dungeons while you level. They will take your gear that you are working hard to tank and get. They can start their own group and slap a shield on and tank just like you are doing. Be picky - you are the group leader.
---
&gt; We have their attention. Let's make the most of it.
---
And this is how you ruin it. By making every r/classicwow mouth-breather start thinking their ridiculous ideas might be heard.
---
30 min of talking about content schedule
---
2hours of talking about TBC if it is ever released....
---
Unfortunately the Devs said they have fixed most areas that you used to be able to glitch into
---
Bit pessimistic... Just look at the last post, we've already been making the most of it! 
---
Activision have nothing to say about in Blizzard, so still no though :D
---
but the last blue post also confirmed they're doing progressive itemization? a fresh 1.12 server back in the day did NOT have progressive itemization, so also different
---
Hello, just wanted to say please dont opt for a text only sub as was suggested. Plenty of people here make quality content of note (videos!). I'td be a shame to deny those people a platform because others cant help but spam low effort images &amp; website made map "art".
---
I've made a few videos at this point and posted them here, all of which have made the front page and incited discussion. Truth is there isnt any quick fix for the low effort crap that doesn't also involve shutting out all legitimate content as well.
---
If you want to change it up from tanking you should totally go caster role like mage or lock.  Mages are needed for sheep in dungeons and locks succubus would charm.  CC was king in those 5 mans.  Mages are needed for aoe and locks are better at solo dps.  Each have their perks and are good choices.
---
Should have hired the nost guys to manage the classic servers.
---
But at least so far, Blizzard seems to be copying the methods private servers have used to manage vanilla, which is a good thing.
---
I was wrong.  I havent tanked it since TBC became available.  Good luck with your druid tank
---
Your justification is based on assuming players fuck up. Maybe just play with better ppl so you can kill ony faster with 40 ppl.
---
Make sure to add the stealthed horde rogue near the Raven Hill who will be ganking Alliance 10 hours a day.
---
I destroyed my earth totem on my first toon, so I deleted hom because I thought Id ruined the character.
---
They said they fixed most spots already
---
Yeah point at things you had nothing to do with and claim responsibility. Not deluded at all...
---
I know. They already stated, they don't have the databases for pre 1.12. So...
---
&gt;And that modified values in TBC were applied to ALL NPC's in Vanilla, when TBC went live...INCLUDING raid bosses armor values, spell resists, critical hit chance of bosses...and I think (I am not sure tho) that crushing blows were removed in TBC.
---
Yes and over the years servers have been working on their own core changing shit to match as close to vanilla as the developer remembers or from what info they can get... every pserver is different unless they're running stock and any notable server in recent time has not been running stock...
---
I mean look at the big core that had quest values set to TBC levels, what else in these servers are around TBC? We have no idea, this is doubly true when you realize these developers are fucking with dungeon and raid values as well. 
---
With all that said I doubt the meta will really be that significant of a change, I don't raid at all on private servers so I may just be naive but it very well could be close to the meta in pservers we just cannot know. 
---
Right... Ok
---
Even 'rare' is much bigger than you think with the consequences of scale. Let's pick an arbitrarily rare 1 in 1000 bosses, a misloot occurs. From your personal perspective, that isn't often at all as maybe you see it happen once a year. However, with a large player base (such as the millions during original vanilla/BC pre-trading era - not making a classic prediction here), you will instead see hundreds to thousands of misloots daily. From their perspective, it happened a lot.
---
I didn't discover autorun until like MoP. Whoops. 
---
Careful of the trap of trying to relive your memories.  Sometimes they're simply not meant to be relived.  I had a huge crush on a girl in school, and she always wore Victoria's Secret perfume.  Scent is the strongest sense tied to memory, so that perfume was engrained on my psyche.  Years later, working in a restaurant, there was a server wearing the same perfume.  Initially it brought back a flood of intense emotions and memories, prompting me to compliment her on her perfume every time she wore it.  The thing is, she always wore it.  Every shift.  The memories tied to that scent started to have less and less of an effect, until eventually it just faded away into the myriad of smells in the kitchen.  That feeling that it sparked in me initially ceased to be, and with it that memory connection to the perfume.  I've had the same situations with music.  You remember an album you listened to constantly when you were younger, but haven't heard it for a long time.  You start listening to it again, with that initial burst of emotion, that continually fades with repeated listening.
---
You know what's funny though?  My roomie and I have quest nights once a week on the Light's Hope server.  Every time I boot up that game, and that gentle orchestral melody of the Barrens kicks in, or Stranglethorn Vale, and without fail those memories from the early-2000s always come back.  Always.  I turn my game sounds to low, and crank the music, and my roomie and I get lost in our nostalgia for a few hours.  In fact, the more vanilla I play, the brighter those memories become in my mind.  My first Rag kill, my first epic, the AQ gates opening, it all floods back.  I'm holding on to so much hope that Blizzard knocks classic out of the park.
---
Friend of mine got his Paladin to mid 30's when someone pointed out to him he could cast healing spells on himself
---
I remember it being 3g per stack, which is why I usually prefered mining it over Mythril
---
Especially with a dungeon like deadmines where you finally get invited to a group full of level 18s going, "OMG I love vanilla wow, it's the best."  Then wipe 4 times and the group breaks up before you get on the boat.
---
If you know what you're doing, take on the mantle of being the party leader and only invite appropriately leveled players.  It'll be much faster and rewarding.
---
I kept needing on everything because I would win every roll.  I did not understand that it was bad.  Then somebody called me a ninja  and I did not know what it was so I said yes, I am a ninja.  I was so proud of being called that. 
---
God, the scamsscummers of D2 were everywhere.
---
When items broke i would throw them away and buy new ones from the vendor LOL, i remember vividly throwing away bows on my hunter and just buying new ones, i even thought "damn this game is realistic" :D :D 
---
If you haven't actually played vanilla, very very little of your understanding of retail is applicable. The design philosophies are completely different between games. Your best bet would be to educate yourself on vanilla details using the same resources everyone else does who plays vanilla (if your first instinct is to look up some 'content' creators YouTube, you're doing it wrong. I also would not use the info posted on this sub and consider it 100% correct. For every one honest person who doesn't know something and is genuinely seeking answers, theres a thousand people who know just as little, but post here speaking as an authority. Again, the content creators you are more familiar with on YouTube should not be used as a source of information. None of them played the game extensively back then, and none of them are playing vanilla right now. Its truly a case of 'blind leading the blind' that you should try to avoid.

/r/classicwow is becoming /r/inkarnate

Welcome to a role playing game. I can play both sides. The opposite side is my enemy.

Please, show proof that bosses do more damage to tanks in Vanilla than private servers.
---
Saying some guy in your guild's hp bar jumped up and down too much doesnt mean shit. Same thing happens to fury tanks on private servers. They just have 11k  HP cause of full wbuffs and consumes. They pop stoneshields to stay alive on tough bosses.
---
Again, post proof. 
---
If raiding is one of your primary concerns, avoid mage.  Very boring at end game.  
---
Are hunters in Raids as bad as everyone says? Torn between Orc warlock or hunter. 
---
Also, how many tanks are in a 40 man?
---
How often do you find yourself going back to a trainer to get stronger spells?
---
Source?
---
&gt;nobody from Blizzard gives a flying fuck on what retail players want
---
except for the fact that Blizzard is practically making all of the changes players want.
---
inkarnate.com
---
I started playing WoW in August 2007, it wasn't until summer 2009 at level 74 that I realised that you could change the graphics settings...
---
&gt;These features were not added until very late in Vanillas life cycle, and for a true Classic 
---
Yeah, considering I posted that.
---
LFD is how they handled long wait times.
---
LFR is how they handled raids not being done by a lot of people.
---
Flying is how they handled..who even knows, they just added it.
---
So should we just readd every feature that led to people getting so upset with the games design that they petitioned and begged and pleaded Blizzard to make classic servers?
---
Are you just openly OK with history repeating itself? I don't understand.
---
No cross server ANYTHING, as said at Blizzcon.
---
"I'm going to reply and not even read the entire post because I'm only here to flame and insult people"
---
&gt;These features were not added until very late in Vanillas life cycle, 
---
LFD was Wrath, cross realm BGs was in fact 1.12
---
Lmao, "They all kicked if they do stupid shit.." "..Cya Raje!"
---
[Why are you contradicting me when you know that you are just making stuff up?](http://web.archive.org/web/20060328012831/http://www.warcraftrealms.com/weeklyactivity.php)
---
Okay, so you abandoned your certain +7% hit theorycrafting calculations in favor of an anecdote of a single DW fury warrior from 14 years ago that you didn't even play. Amazing! This is galaxy brain tier stuff right here. You truly are deserving of the elitist attitude you have.
---
I've played your examples. BWL farming with BRE can outperform DW. CTS/Thrash Blade can outperform many DW setups. Of course it makes a huge difference in this case if you play Horde or Alliance, but to say the things you said based on almost no information simply proves you are ignorant of the underlying math.
---
The problem with pvp in launch is that it breaks the power level, with people sitting on rank14 - BWL gear with MC patch. 
---
it should be introduced between DM and BWL. Or else pvp will have pve impact, and that was never how vanilla was or is ment to be
---
Outside of guild content on vent I listened too alot of cradle of filth, otep, job for a cowboy and Pantera. Occasionally some eminem or bone thugs and harmony. This time around I'll mostly be listening too make sure my kids actually stayed in bed. 
---
Think I heard it on classic cast
---
God when people dual wield fury tank in Classic Im going to come laugh at you. 
---
I freaking love playing as a rogue for the gameplay and world pvp aspect of the game, however i'm a bit concerned about leveling and raid spots, i remember my first 15-20 levels were horrible last time i played a private server, then it was ok but slow :p
---
Any spec you level with, ensure to have a healing set. 
---
There are players who will NOT invite you to groups if you are trying for a dps slot. It's just a reality, even if you are twinked and will do more dps than most in the group. The paladin meme is too big for all the small minds who will be playing the game.
---
Being in a good guild who knows you will make it easier to dps but healing will get you in the majority of groups far easier than trying to sell your dps worth.
---
There are many others like it, but these are mine. My buttons are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life. Without me, my buttons are are useless. Without my buttons, I am useless.
---
It's not hypocritical to suggest a stoping point for Classic. Either it's just vanilla, or it's the original trilogy so to speak. Again. Nobody is clamoring for a Redone Cataclysm. There is one private server that has catered to this group for years and it is incredibly unpopular for all the reasons Cata was unpopular at release. The fact is, we are getting Vanilla Classic because there is a demand, and Blizzard sees some sort of financial incentive to revisit Vanilla.  Considering the popularity of both TBC and wotlk, the argument could be made that these would fall in line with the financial motivation of bringing Classic back. I personally didn't enjoy Wrath, and quit before Ulduar. But I recognize it's popularity and that thematically, it's narrative book-ends the first three iterations well. 
---
Re-using unfinished &amp; unused assets to create new content would still mean building new zones and dungeons, new mobs and new attacks &amp; dmg/armor values for those mobs, writing new quests, creating new gear, designing new raid encounters, and rebalancing classes for said new content. All of which would need to be done in a way that is easily accessible to the majority of players, but doesnt trivialize the insane gear found in Naxx. What you're asking for is essentially an entirely new Expansion to Vanilla that Blizzard most certainly wont pay for or invest in. As a pie in the sky ideal, sure it could be fun. But for most players, simply rereleasing A TBC classic would satisfy that and for minimal cost. The content is all there. Simply go back and fix the vendor items, recipes, etc, and rebuff the raid encounters to the pre 2.4 state. If we get anything past Vanilla, it seems to me the most likely scenario. 
---
Check out Kargoz on YouTube, he has put out some great videos so far.
---
Can they? Dope
---
Keep in mind locks didn't battle res back then with soulstone. You had to apply to one person that was important if they did die. It worked more like shaman reincarnation that you could give to someone 
---
Yup, I feel people are really under estimating the strength of the redone talents (some class/specs were pretty terrible early on), and the doubled debuff slots. MC can probably be done in questing gear by a organized knowledgable group.
---
As a warrior - I didn't realize the warrior quests were important. It was lvl 33 before somebody told me and I felt like a doofus. 
---
They can't handle your mass. Its a plus.
---
Hunters are indeed the worst ranged DPS in raids, and it only gets worse as the server progresses.  Tank numbers are always dependent on what content you're hitting.  I think 3-4 is typical.
---
Yeah really... You're pretty much required to do some sort of grinding in vanilla for your level 40 mount.  It's insanely cheap to get the lock mount compared to grinding.  100 mana?  What is that like 10% of their base mana at level 40?  Come on now...
---
I used to think that you had to have your spell book open to cast spells and I would scroll through it to click the spell I wanted to cast
---
 They have internal change logs dating back to the 1990s.
---
I kept all the green gear in my bags thinking I wouldn't "lose" the stats 
---
When bad things that destroy the community were added is irrelevant. Bad ideas are bad ideas regardless.
---
I'm all for keeping no LFD, but when dungeon wait times take 45+ minutes, then you need LFD.
---
Again, do you see how your argument makes no sense?
---
Lol i did the same thing :D kept buying bows from vendors everytime one broke :D 
---
I had been publicly stating on other reddits that ActiBlizz should have just offered classic as a franchise to an indie team in each region.  Would have cost them nothing other than the risk to their image if one of those franchise holders screws up.  But as you can see in the current private realms scene there is room for corruption, and ActiBlizz like to keep everything above board for the share holders.
---
My only issue with Blizzard is that the communication from them could and should have been more regular and transparent.  I still have concerns, but over all I think Blizz will do a better job of this than some disheartened fans may think.
---
I didn’t understand that you were supposed to do quests to help you level so I made it all the way into the 40’s just killing mobs. 
---
People still do that 13 years later...
---
ARTHAS DID NOTHING WRONG
---
When I was 14 I didnt realize hunters could use bows (or how to use bows in general) until lvl 22. I was fucken raptor striking the shit outta ppl
---
Probably the dumbest thing I've read all day 
---
Which say what?
---
You have no clue.
---
They probably say the same thing the patch notes say. Even if they have explicit values, there is a good chance at least 10% of those are mistyped, and have the wrong values. Then what?
---
So what is the meat of the discussion in this episode? Do they actually go in depth about the differences of private servers vs Classic?
---
But pvp does have pve impact, that's half the reason people rank. You don't play 16 hours a day for months just for fun. I think it's ok for These hard-core players to have gear that makes MC, an already easy raid a bit easier.
---
Devilsaur mafia needs:
---
A large global server (need enough dudes to be there 24/7)
---
Cross-faction collusion (important)
---
Same-faction griefing at times
---
And the biggest that they'd deny but is 100% true - RMT.
---
Classic will be regional servers, cross faction nonsense is bannable, and where ungoro mafia friends had private server GMs choosing to look the other way when they sell gold, blizzard will not. Further, without the huge global server, they wouldn't make enough or be able to corner the market effectively to even engage in RMT which when you get past the initial autism is what fuels the mafia.
---
tldr: the dudes made RL money from doing it, it wasn't just to generate crying in discord chatrooms. There WILL be guilds or organized groups trying to camp devilsaurs, but there won't be anything approaching the "mafia" that has happened on pservers. Period.
---
I wanted too but my wife and friends refuse too play horde. So I'm going alliance again when classic comes out
---
what your argument for not haveing something that was part of vanilla is stuff they added years and years after ?
---
im all for #nochanges, im not intressted in another broken pserver meta. That is why we want the real game.
---
I don't have a class to suggest since I'll be maining warlock so I'm biased. But if you want to pvp then orc is the only way to go, the stun resist is too op. Especially for shaman/warlock where rogues stunlocking can be a problem 
---
It was when they was needed. Idk how long you have been playing but im pretty sure that was a thing. It kept people from needing and putting in the ah when another needed to put on.
---
It won't be in at launch. It's best it isn't in at launch. Historically it wasn't in at launch. It can't be in a launch due to gear scale placement.
---
Not worried ... because it won't be in at launch. ;)
---
2 weeks makes it to where it's less likely someone dies trying to grind 60 week one. 2 months makes the game DOA as the no-lifers will be out of stuff to do by week 3-4 and they'll just ruin the leveling experience for everyone else as they're out farming (heard of the devilsaur mafia that occurs on private servers?).
---
There is really good mixes i always listen to when PvP'ing just search up "classic wow PvP mix" and you get amazing results!
---
Yeah, fuck you \*-shuffles cards-\* artists! 
---
Am I missing something here?
---
It was my first mmorpg. At lvl 8 my pc crashed and I was distraught because I was sure I had to start over. 
---
You still have to go significantly out of  your way for Verigan's with a party.
---
There are plenty of things wrong with TBC &amp; Wrath, but they were great expansions. More people would agree that Vanilla was the best. If you're a #nochanges person, then you're a #changes person for the expansions. I'd personally love to see what can be improved upon during TBC &amp; Wrath using Vanilla Ideology. People are already calling for the 2 expansions to be released with changes. Things like:
---
* 10/25 raid versions
---
* Heroic raid &amp; dungeon versions
---
* Heirlooms
---
* Dungeon finder
---
* Quest objective locations revealed
---
* Flying
---
* Neutral cities
---
* Faction specific class removal
---
* Stat progression being off
---
You going to raid hard this time around?  I would say warrior either way.  But that means tank, and learning to stance dance.  Could do a hybrid spec for dungeons; and if not raiding hard it works for offtanking too for an occasional raid. 
---
roll dps, u will regret rolling healer becouse healing is cooperative job and meters doesnt matter at all, and gearing wise healers just dont need so much gear and i think they r third in line of gearing tanks &gt; dps &gt; healers becouse they dont come with contact with mobs/bosses.
---
Thats the private server meta. But that dont reflect how the game was. Back in vanilla r14 was prestige, not pve gain.
---
queue times get high because people on your server aren't pvping. so its either no pvp against the people you know anyway or pvp at all.
---
You might find if you explain your reasoning when making objections people would have a better idea of what the fuck you are taking about.
---
I mean. There are other lands &amp; worlds to explore in the lore. I agree that they shouldn't have been as aggressive as they were though. Northrend addition would've felt better after Vanilla.
---
Just so I understand (I've never played a priest before), with this build you'd respec at 40, and then respec again at 60 into whatever your end game build is? 
---
Also, I checked out the video, what are your thoughts on that smite build that he suggests? I'm not sure that's what I want... But I do like that it makes the priest a bit better at healing, since I might want to heal some dungeons while leveling. 
---
Ya ya. Because talking about the content schedule for 2.5 hours would have been better.
---
&gt; 1.For example, person A might post a question about the viability of hybrid specs. Person B will reply with a motivated response about how this spec will function in the game.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 2.Person C will reply that min/maxers are elitists, person B is trying to suck all the fun out of the game, and private servers are nothing like vanilla so we should not be able to conclude anything from thinking about it.
---
&gt; And then it usually ends in people throwing shit at each other in the comments. OR the thread being taken over by people gleefully proclaiming that WoW is not about trying to be good at the game, but about having fun.  
---
For a minute there I thought you were talking about this subreddit.  
---
And then I realized you're accidentally talking about this subreddit.  
---
When I was 12 first getting into wow, I was so hyped to get into the game I didn't realize you could change race and class
---
There's two ways to look at it. You can have the grenades and gadgets from engineering to help give the upper hand. But alchemy/herbalism could give you an income to be able to buy AH blues and twink a bit since you plan to stay lower leveled
---
I started with a mage. Found a shield that had a good intel stat on it. Was distraught when I was explained mages can't wear shields. Was nicknamed MT3 for 4 years after that! :D
---
I came from RUnescape where quests where optional and leveling was way faster just killing monsters.
---
So i leveled my shammy by almost only killing mobs, very slowly.. I also didnt know and/or realise mobs stop giving xp after a certain level difference.. So my brother had to tell to get out of stone talon mountain at like lvl45...
---
I choose stone talon mountains because somehow i got convinced the chimera's flying around would give really good loot (they didn't, they just looked more impressive then the other mobs).
---
I imagine the major cities will be as crowded as the starting zones, so suspect they will be sharded as well.
---
I spent a long time wondering who 1st. General was. I allways tried to follow his orders though
---
Yeah, it wasn't at launch in retail because the game wasn't completed at launch and people didn't know what rewards they would get as they ranked, but Private servers, the reason classic wow is being released again, have the PvP system implemented at launch and you can see the benefits from it.
---
I still have mine on retail! Best thing ever! 
---
I second this. Great content creator, especially for people looking to be knowledgeable on broader game topics like class selection and leveling.
---
I tried my friends lvl 60 hunter with a rare pet. Don't remember which one but he said he had been grinding a whole day to get it. Rare spawn I suppose.
---
Well... I was roaming ashenvale and the pet was unhappy. So unhappy it fleed. He was a bit angry a first but not after he came to understand I didn't know anything about having to feed the pet.
---
When I started I made a pala and vividly remember paying a 60 to boost me in ZF. I wanted some sword and would pay him well after it dropped. 15 runs in he gave up and I got plenty of free xp and drops along the way. Quit soon after though. 
---
Played recently on Elysium I wanted a ranged dps and from HS I thought the shadow priest class mentality were quite cool. Even with close to perfect vanilla gear there is no real dps in SP compared to warlock or mage. Hunters are beatable though. Was good fun though. 
---
&gt; Blizzard stated they don't have any data prior to 1.12
---
They said they found earlier data as well.
---
&gt; [...and when we looked, we found data going back to version 1.12—and even earlier.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22646759/restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel-recap)
---
1.12 is likely the most complete data set they have but it was definitely a design decision, at least in part. In their original dev watercooler they said they picked 1.12 because they thought it represented a "final" version of Vanilla which was a good foundation for Classic.
---
&gt;It's not hypocritical to suggest a stoping point for Classic. Either it's just vanilla, or it's the original trilogy so to speak. Again. Nobody is clamoring for a Redone Cataclysm.
---
Ok, so lets change that to MoP then which was and still is a popular expansion.
---
&gt;Re-using unfinished &amp; unused assets to create new content would still mean building new zones and dungeons, new mobs and new attacks &amp; dmg/armor values for those mobs, writing new quests, creating new gear, designing new raid encounters, and rebalancing classes for said new content.
---
Yep, we are paying a subscription fee after all (at least us that has no intention of playing BFA) and I would assume making vanilla style content would be significantly less complex than any patch/zone or whatever for BFA. They could do another Zul'gurub/AQ20 ish type of raid, and eventually something above nax.
---
 &gt;All of which would need to be done in a way that is easily accessible to the majority of players
---
Thats not really in the vanilla spirit tho, nax was not and will still not be an accessible raid to the majority of the playerbase.
---
&gt;What you're asking for is essentially an entirely new Expansion to Vanilla that Blizzard most certainly wont pay for or invest in.
---
If Classic wow is a success, then why not? Blizzard original goal was for 400k players for WoW, which would have been profitable. And that was from developing the game from scratch.
---
&gt;But for most players, simply rereleasing A TBC classic would satisfy that and for minimal cost. The content is all there. Simply go back and fix the vendor items, recipes, etc, and rebuff the raid encounters to the pre 2.4 state. If we get anything past Vanilla, it seems to me the most likely scenario.
---
Yes, its the easiest thing for blizzard to do (especally considering TBC/Wrath remains almost completely unchanged on retail). But if they go that route I will expect them to push it further than what you consider "classic" wow, as cata wow is not the same as MoP wow, and mop is not the same as WoD etc.
---
Even Legion which was a very recent expansion had decent success and people might nostalgic for that as well down the road :)
---
Likeness is different than perfection. Your comments read of someone who intentionally seeks to create emotional responses and dissention. You previously,  attempted, to call my responses as attacks and now do exactly that. Also, you just fed right into my previous response; denigrating someones possible age as a reason their opinion must be wrong.
---
I'm usually a DPS player but I tried priest on nost and I really enjoyed it, people really appreciate a good healer, much more so in vanilla.  From reading your post it sounds like you would enjoy it as well and it also doesn't sound like you would have a hard time at all playing shadow if you ever decided you wanted to change things up a bit.
---
If you think a lack of an honor system will prevent people from ganking and engaging in world PvP you are mistaken. Back in the day not everyone understood ranking or the honor system but people still went out their way to murder each other, its basic gamer instinct.
---
&gt; "Man, I really miss the days when Naxx was the endgame and we didn't have people running around in Grim Batol gear!"
---
This is easily resolved by adding new servers for new expansions. Classic Vanilla servers will remain with Naxx as the end game, but you can transfer whatever characters you want onto a TBC Classic or Wrath Classic server (or create new ones). This allows each part of the game to remain permanently playable. Eventually people will move on, but 20 Vanilla Classic servers can merge into 10, or 5, or eventually 1. At the very least 1.
---
Yeah, and the game also wasn't released in its 1.12 state. Vanilla content is already easy so I don't think that can be part of the argument. 
---
I've seen plenty of discussion on here about min/max'ing. In fact, it used to be almost entirely "here's the min/max cookie cutter build, anyone who deviates will never be invited to anything ever". There was a push back to that recently. Maybe you just need to go back and look for older threads.
---
Blizzard: releases classic WoW 1.12
---
You: I want a more "classic" feel.
---
Blizzard: facepalm
---
Movement speed and gold are both more valuable
---
You can't make any decent counter arguments so you resort to being the victim and then asking how old the other guy is. I agree with him after reading this discussion, you are incredibly dense. You know he has a point but you just don't want to admit it.
---
Thanks.
---
Yea, Shadow is certainly a backup option, but if I knew going in I'd be DPS'ing, I sure wouldn't pick a Vanilla Shadow Priest.
---
Maybe not, but we still want as close to the real feeling, we can get and adding honor system in start is littleraly game breaking.
---
You have guilds stacking r14 just because it is broken gear.
---
Of course, but once people get their pre-bis and farm some gold, which they will get much faster due to the knowledge we have this time around, they will stop playing as much. 
---
That idea works in theory, but it's ultimately throttled by how many people are interested in what versions of WoW as well as how granular Blizzard is willing to go with supporting that kind of spread.
---
I'm of the opinion that, assuming player base is big enough to justify it a few years out from Classic's Launch, they'll probably release TBC servers and offer one-time character copies over to them.
---
Similar-ish. Because it warned me it would cost to respecc, I didn't invest any talent points initially. Scared of making wrong choice and also didn't realise how important they were. And never got my head round pet skills on my hunter, so never trained my pet up at all.
---
Ah, you're MisterPotat's alt. One account at a time.
---
Right, because all of Vanilla WoW, the 2+ years of it's existence lived all in one patch that came out during the last few months. Yep, you totally got me.
---
/s
---
There are many ways the game can grow. Splitting the community shouldn't be a problem, because you can simply merge servers. If TBC is released &amp; 50% of the people opt in to transfer 1 character (at the very least), then you simply consolidate the vanilla servers.
---
You realize the expansions are literally "post naxx content"
---
This Arcane Crystal sells for 20 silver! :D
---
I've always wanted them to buff the encounters in classic because 1.12 has so much better class and item design. People will do twice the amount of dps with bis blues in 1.12 vs 1.02 
---
Not understanding what stats were or proper gear my 26 warrior had pieces with spirit and intellect. I even wielded a staff for a short period of time... 
---
I'm sorry, I assume people aren't complete retards.
---
Haha yeah, he had. He didn't know any other way to play so 😅
---
What makes it so booring and would lock be the same?
---
I'd recommend you not do enchanting/tailoring until after 40 and you have your mount.  You'd be far better off leveling 2 gathering professions (make skinning one of them) for making money and banking the extra cloth/greens you picked on an alt.  Once you hit 40 and get your mount, then drop the gathering professions and level up tailoring/enchanting with stored materials and a bit of farming.
---
You are very welcome :)
---
I love fury but it is a pve spec with dual wield for a tryhard type of player doing raid dps.
---
 Warriors in pvp go Arms with a 2 hander and respec between raids usually. That's what I did anyways since the MS debuff is so powerful and warriors are the only ones with it. You can still have fun wrecking ungeared people as fury with a 2h but arms is the best for sweeping strikes too. Usually you can get your hands on pretty good 2 handers since people dont use them for pve. I had a Bonereaver's Edge which was incredible and only had to beat a couple people on the pvp roll. No one uses it well in pve except maybe retadins who aren't taken seriously anyways haha
---
Good luck and you'll have fun no matter what I'm sure :) the fun part is how social the game is and the communities you will build
---
Wait times get high for dungeons because your server is done doing that dungeon or dungeons in general. So either it's no dungeons with the people you know or know dungeons at all.
---
See how your argument continues to not make sense?
---
You know what they say about those who assume...
---
so you can sustain 2.5-3 kills a minute on a pally, thats impressive. My priest can do about 2.15 kpm with highest damage wand and staff with a very high-density of mobs. Whats your secret?
---
When i first started i had no idea what "need" or "greed" even meant, so i just assumed "need" meant that whomever needed it the most got it, and "greed" meant that you wanted it for yourself regardless of whether you required it or not.
---
I had no idea why people got so angry at me, since i thought i was being generous by rolling need on everything.
---
To be fair to my young self though, the names doesn't really make that much sense if you don't already know what they mean. I mean, seriously, does anyone even know why it's called "greed" of all things?
---
Fans: WoW patch 1.12 is the best, recreate that.
---
Blizzard: Ok, we'll do that, we even found the old database values
---
Fans: No, we want 1.12, but not the enemy values, we want them to "feel" like classic.
---
Blizzard: facepalm.
---
Responses like yours are what have me worried! Haha.
---
Well, if I did go DPS, I guess I would try a Warlock as a change of pace from Mage, though again, I might end up regretting it as they're seemingly inferior to Mages, Roges and Warriors for most of Vanilla.
---
Sorry.  
---
Without "Please stop reposting this question every single day" as one of your voting options, I'm afraid I can't participate in your poll.  
---
No, wasting time drinking and eating and lifedraining when they could simply buy a decent mount.
---
Lol i did this mistake in diablo2, reached inferno with no talents spent.
---
What about for raids? How important is the cc when it will be broken almost immediately?
---
Yupp that's it Buddy, im his alt. A several year old one with thousands of comments. Like I know you know I'm not his alt just like I know you know he has a point, but for some reason you can't admit it. Its ok to be wrong on the internet mate.
---
That guild will be clearing all content regardless. How does that impact you?
---
This would only work if they cycled in new servers and gave people more than enough time to play on the Naxx patch.  
---
Well depends on how itemization is. There existed a set of R14 weapons that had 50dps instead of 60(bwl-like), and private servers don't use the good versions of r14 weapons before bwl comes out. So no you don't actually get BWL gear before BWL comes out. 
---
Andorhal is very detailed in WC3
---
I feel like healing meters are an epeen contest in retail now though. I know in my guild our healers are competative on meters.
---
This is exactly how I see it going. We aren't paying $40 for a new game, but Blizzard could make a little extra by adding cheap character transfers. Perhaps dub them as "character progression transfers"
---
Think about it. The content in retail is extremely limited to simply BFA. Sure you have to level through some existing content, but classic with transfers allow you to progress through thousands of hours before reaching the end game. With a subscription, this is a no brainer for blizzard.
---
I know, but it's more about giving the raid a safety net by putting it on a healer or tank. It's a niche thing that they can do and I'm wondering if the rest of the game play would be fun around that.
---
What if no?
---
Aside from the fact that the warlock mount is ugly af, is it possible you're talking about warlock mount casting costs mana?  
---
Otherwise I'm a retard.  
---
&gt; ...more than enough time to play on the Naxx patch
---
That's where I get stuck, though.  How much time is "enough?"  People have been doing it over and over again for the past 15 years.
---
Remember to use sunblock before entering tropical and desert zones!
---
Technically with character transfers, they could release TBC &amp; Wrath now. I'd rather wait though
---
Speccing my mage with spirit/armor.
---
...how is this even possible lol!
---
Yea, my memory of Vanilla is Paladins dominating healing meters, but at the time, no one knew what the hell they were doing in my guild, so I wasn't sure if that was a fair representation of healing.
---
Private servers from the past couple years have had some pretty good theorycrafting threads in their forums. There are some pretty in depth spreadsheets out there
---
Thanks for the post. I'm not insane. These threads are far too common an occurrence.
---
Oh. Ignore my reply from earlier. Didn't realize you replied down here as well.  
---
We're on the same page.  
---
Fans: Blizzard will change things, I know it.
---
Blizzard: We found the 1.12 data, and we don't want to change anything, because it won't be classic anymore.
---
Fans: We want you to change this, this and this.
---
&gt;We should be focusing on Cross-server BGs, faction changes, server transfers and character renaming. These are all features that are immersion breaking and community destroying. These features were not added until very late in Vanillas life cycle, and for a true Classic WoW experience they need to not be in the game all of classic.
---
But those are not things that Blizzard has confirmed will be in the game.
---
That said, I somewhat agree, there are bigger fish to fry than loot trading. Loot trading abuse will be as big of a problem as ninja looting, which was not that big of a problem. Despite what the vocal cynics are saying, most people are not assholes.
---
However, I disagree that the other issues you're listing are that serious. XR battlegrounds are not an issue if it's handled how it was in Vanilla. I don't want to be grouped with 100 different servers but I don't remember being a part of a battlegroup being a problem. It wasn't an overwhelming population, you still got to know the active PvP community. Plus, it added a bit of a fandom aspect, you would route for your server's best to beat other server's best.
---
I don't imagine that faction, server, and name changes will be that big of a deal if they are allowed. I'm not sure I would even notice.
---
I wouldn't use cheap shot while leveling because I thought the mob would get mad and enrage. 
---
Can you not think critically? You do realize words have more meaning beyond what is literally written. Furthermore people have talked about many different possible paths they'd like to see. 1.12 became popular because that's what the private server community played on. To add to that, the best guess and most operable format that could be used.
---
Saying I want something to feel more classic as you put it is relational to different points during Vanilla. I'd want MC to feel like it did when I first entered, not how it felt to run through during an end game patch. A progressive experience shouldn't be limited to gating. That's an opinion you can disagree with, but you aren't looking for an actual conversation. You'd rather read things at face value and attempt to belittle anything you disagree with.
---
This is the most Vanilla thing. This was so much the type of mentality people had playing the game. Private servers don't capture the naive but enthusiastic noobery going on. 
---
dude, use classic pettopia:  
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
My priest was one of the first toons I rolled, and was my main until I unsubscribed in Legion.  He was a Tailor.  I would make bags, and stand I. goldshire yelling “6 slot bags!  3s!”  Then later “8 slot bags! 19s!”   Finally after about 3 days of this, someone told me to STFU and use the Auction House.  LOL!
---
It looks like Easter colors
---
Awesome :D, I used to main a shaman, I'm sure totem management skills will come back with practice. Thanks!
---
Something about how giant epic 2h looks when a taurens swinging it is pleasing. It would feel so good executing the tiny alliance. Some people say but you're a target. Good I'm not a rogue, the mentality of the warrior class no matter the spec is always "I'm right here see if you can do anything about it before I charge you"
---
For shaman though trolls are great. Tauren are too so it's tough. 
---
Probably not to be honest, might try my hand at some casual raiding but in all likelihood I'll probably just spend 99% of my time standing around in Orgrimmar once I hit 60. 
---
... That is how you play this game, isn't it?
---
Vanilla warrior always sounded fun to me, played one in wotlk but alot of things had changed by then. Thanks for the reply!
---
No there is literally no comparison to be made between the two systems you are conflating.
---
it forces serious pvers to pvp. instead of pvping because its fun. Let me ask you a question, why do you feel the need to have extremly broken gear to even get the incentive to pvp, dont you pvp because it is fun ?
---
That's an interesting take I hadn't heard before. Make it a 5-man continent that just isn't soloable. 
---
Not too often. Leveling toolkit being:
---
- Blessing of Wisdom, so long as I can maintain KPH without OOM, it can wait a bit, pick it up whenever I get Holy Light / Exorcism
---
- Holy Light, every ~8 levels. If I can still live reasonably well without needing a heavier heal, it can wait.
---
- Seal of Command. Judging this does shit damage, so level 1 is fine, pick up extra levels if I happen to be in town.
---
- Exorcism is available every 2nd level before Holy Light, so I might go 2 levels with a slightly gimped damage (4%) here while waiting on it. Only does ~10% of damage each fight, so it's low priority.
---
**Level 1 Seal of Command** and autoattack is like 80% of my damage, so waiting 2 levels for exorcism isn't a big deal, I can pick it up later while getting Holy Light. If the old level of Holy Light tops me off just fine after a fight, it can wait too.
---
TL;DR: Once every 8 levels, if needed.
---
We have zero plans, that I'm aware of, to go text-only. I don't see that ever happening. We would tighten restrictions on low-effort posts before we'd resort to an all out ban, IMO.
---
This isn't that big a deal tbh. Most people didn't use addons in vanilla. 
---
first one absolutely goes to MT, even 2nd one goes to OT, after that fury is fine, boa is like bis for tanks forever
---
&gt; So are you saying that if wait times are high to fill a dungeon then open the flood gates to LFD?
---
Not even close to comparable. LFD is a significant change to how you interact with other players in the game. XR battlegrounds changes nothing about battlegrounds gameplay, it just increases the population.
---
Fans: Blizzard ruins everything, they'll ruin classic 1.12 by changing stuff.
---
I agree. 
---
People seem to assume that faction changes, character renames, and server transfers won't be included. We assume that Blizzard has no plans to add these things and that's probably why you don't see much talk about them. 
---
I've got some of these too. I remember listening to a lot of ska bands in Darkshore
---
&gt; You don't play 16 hours a day for months just for fun.
---
You're right, you play 16 hours a day for months because you are fucking mental. Stop pooping in socks, take a shower, and rejoin society.
---
In 2006 I ran SM a million times as a Hunter to get the full SM mail set to look like Herod. Sadly was not able to get the axe. Another Hunter in my group, who already had it, rolled need and won because he wanted to “test different” enchants. Tears were shed that day.
---
Sorry for my question, but is there a release for Classic WOW?
---
Been out of this game for years, thinking about rejoining when classic comes out.
---
This was me. 
---
Don’t upvote what you like as a community! 
---
Yes i look forward to that and miss that so much. Ty :)
---
Yes! I remember everyone looking for rats to pump up the damage meters! Especially when you landed a crit
---
Yes there are.
---
You are arguing you want to trade community for convenience. Faster queues, community aspect destroyed.
---
LFD was added to for convenience, and traded community for convenience.
---
They are the EXACT same thing. If you want one, you want both. You can't say one is OK and the other isn't - they are both the exact same thing.
---
Former Priest here.  My memories are fond.  Leveling was quite efficient.  I was Undead so having cannibalize kept my downtime even lower.  The main thing that slows you down is your missing quality of life components that other classes have like pets, movement speed, CC, or portals.  Once I hit 60 I felt like a god in PVP, even with just basic PVP/Dungeon gear.  Once again, being Undead  helps here since Alliance don't get WotF and fear is your main CC.  I eventually bored of that and went Holy to start doing endgame PVE.  Raiding was alright. You're basically just watching meters but you *are* one of the more important players so there's that.  PVP as Holy was surprisingly fun. You are mostly defenseless, but the challenge of staying alive was exhilarating.  The flipside to this is that if you ever meet even ONE person who knows to protect you, you become a wreckingball of death, especially if they are melee DPS.  My fondest memories in the entire game are when it would "click" in a BG with a Warrior that I was pocketing him and we would just steamroll the entire server together.  It's a great class but it's very "all or nothing" if that makes any sense.
---
You're right, there needs to be a demand. I feel it will get there.
---
It definitely is a life saver having a SS in any dungeon as well. Corpse runs in vanilla aren't very fun so saving your group from that and proving health stones to a tank is nice. People tend to still favor mages in dungeon since sheep is more reliable and healers oom like crazy before end game so water is a big help. I'll still be maining warlock though so my vote obviously goes to locks 
---
I don't even know what point you're trying to make. That everyone that has a different opinion than you has the same one? 
---
There's a reason why #nochanges became a bit of a joke, it was/is a subsect of people with a specific opinion.
---
it just seems really dumb to release reforged after classic, they would make a lot more sales if they release it right before classic
---
oh man i was a melee hunter for far too long, i thought it was a viable option. i was also like 10 or something but yeah holy shit i sucked
---
Crit is more valuable for DPS warriors than hit until you hit the crit cap. Proper DPS warrior rings in t1 are Quick Strike Ring + Don Julio's Band (Painweaver Band if AV not available). In t2 it's Quick Strike Ring + Master Dragonslayer's Ring.
---
Accuria really isn't that good for Fury Warriors and is only a DPS increase over the above rings under full world buff scenarios where the rest of your gear is also heavy crit, low hit. Even in that scenario, the second you die and lose your world buffs, you better put your crit + AP rings back on.
---
This is /r/dadjokes level stuff. Haha, wow....
---
I didnt say it omega lul
---
Yea they could do it, but one of the big disappointments people had about the original Naxx was it came out way too close to BC. It was very hard to get into, let alone complete, and not very many people had a chance to attempt it before new content was released. I don't think they should make that same mistake a second time around. 
---
I don't think it forces serious players to PvP, there are still Ony weps that they can easily compete with. I do PvP for fun, but it's more fun and more competitive when there are rewards.
---
I don't have an answer to your question, but I do understand your frustration. I think the problem is that fresh theorycrafting is few and far between in a 15 year old game; especially one that technically doesn't exist yet. 
---
Which means we get 5 posts a week about "are ret pallies viable???", or "how much time each week will I need to farm consumables?" It just gets really tiring. 
---
95% of the content on this sub is unreadable. It should get better once the game finally launches, and we can actually test stuff and see what works and what doesn't. 
---
The game saw fundamental changes in the switch from Wrath to Cata (talents, soulshards, arrows, pet dynamics, threat generation, and so many more). TBC and Wrath encounters arent virtually unchanged from their retail release since they implemented a massive across the board nerf at the end of TBC. TBC &amp; Wrath are still in the spirit of Vanilla both in feel and play-style whereas MoP was not. Also MoP was not a popular expansion in comparison to the first 2 expansions. You mentioned that providing new content that is easily accessible to the majority of players while not trivializing Naxx isnt in the spirit of Vanilla...except it is. That's what blue PVP gear, ZG, AQ20, cenarion rep/argent dawn rep rewards were. they were catch up mechanics. It makes no sense to creat entirely new zones that only Naxx raiders can access and raid in. It also wouldnt make sense to make new zones that  Naxx raiders can steamroll either.
---
The reason for "why not" is again money. Blizzard just fired 8% of its staff mostly in the community relations and game master departments in favor of automated systems at a time of record profits. Why would they destroy the continuity of their current retail version which is incredibly profitable via micro transactions and risk pissing off that player base, in favor of expensive new development in which players dont want cash shops? It makes no sense. Again, there is no financial motivation, or push from players to have a Cata/MoP/Legion "Classic". The people who like retail wow post Cata are playing retail. Those of us that didn't aren't. Again, some people hated TBC or Wrath also, but poll and poll shows these people are in the vast minority. TBC and Wrath to some extent still felt like Vanilla, just eith different elements. Everything post Cata feels like a different game. I've seen your complaints in other posts about faction imbalance on one of the current TBC servers, but that could be easily fixed with faction locking like Gummy did. I'm not opposed to changes like that even with Vanilla classic either.
---
I was thinking of doing Enchanting and Engineering, drop Enchanting after making the first wand, and switching to mining whole levelling. Then switch Mining for Tailoring at 60.
---
Then you will be just as happy, with getting pvp gear in phase 2 and phase 3. 
---
The difference it that progressing in my scenario is optional. When TBC came out, your character already had different stats &amp; moves &amp; whatnot. You couldn't opt-out of the changes made.
---
I didnt know that I had a map that I could simply open up whenever I wanted. So I would get lost in the NE starting location and get frustrated thus creating several other characters repeating the whole process of getting lost until I gave up on the game and tried it again after a few months.
---
This discovery must have increased your DPM by quite a lot. 
---
I saved up the 1g 20s or something at lv 20 as a paladin because I NEEDED to have polearms. They just taunted me and sounded so cool every time I saw a white polearm.
---
Hit 20, wasted all my money to train and buy a white polearm.
---
Realized the animation was nearly identical to a 2h mace and almost all the polearms (all what 7 of them) were agility and I didn't need much agility.
---
It was such a waste of gold
---
I stacked intellect on my original rogue with the idea that “I’d be smarter so i know where to hit them so I’d do more damage” 
---
What kind of PVE? Because you will probably be fine in dungeons as a healing ele sham but likely you will be a bit of dead weight in raid because you no longer bring mana tide, and miss out on healing way and purification.   
---
As a casual the mindset of never wanting to respec is fine but don't expect optimal performance. 
---
Probably buying up to date greens for my level from the AH and realizing at 40 i missed about 80g for my mount
---
There will already be just a good or better PvP pieces you can get in raids at that point
---
I have some more of these clips but unfortunately the quality is really bad and it is hard to read the combat log. In every clip only 4 hits are shown on the screen, but in the combat log you can see 5 hits/crits. In a few clips SoC also procs once, but is also not shown on the screen lol (in this clip SoC did not proc).  
---
I think the answers to your questions are:
---
\- No, SoC can only proc once  
---
\- Yes, each melee attack can crit
---
\- Yes, SoC can crit
---
ok
---
it would be interesting to hear blizz's take on this.. the problem with tbc becomes who stays on classic and who moves?
---
if they later add wrath then you have a split base over classic, tbc, and wrath.. and where do they stop? cata, mop? eventually you'd have a legacy server of each game expansion.. this may be 10+ years from now be eventually the player base would be too fractured and too much to manage for Blizzard.
---
adding content past classic would also require development time on an older system that blizz may not want to do either.
---
I have a feeling well just hit naxx and get some fresh reroll servers from time to time over the patch cycle.. Im fine with that.. or just staying at end game phase 6 forever and eventually just over the years get all 9 classes to 60 and at least bwl geared to have fun.
---
honestly my ideal fantasy would be adding in stuff from the main continents.. or using caverns of time like they did for 5 man Dungeons.. and just make it blues the level of 1.10 or above.. or bwl or aq level.. nothing naxx level.. but make the itemization and bonuses for hybrid specs.. I know people are against this but if after 2-3 of healing, a proper feral or shadow set with bonuses would be nice.. or have it drop spell tomes like aq did for new spell ranks and also for new spells like a taunt for paladins.
---
I don't see a problem with that if it's after naxx.. yes some guilds might use that to be able to clear naxx but will it matter if naxx has been out for a year and people are later able to clear some bosses now using a different spec? if we're being honest.. it's what blizz would have gotten around to anyway since it's what they did in tbc... so it's not Un blizz like.. but still keeps people in the world and needing to farm the same mats for flasks / food / etc.. no flying.. keep all the raids in the current world setting.. add some new quest hubs or reps for factions we already know are there.. 
---
honestly, at leveling int is a great stat for hunter, its the second best after agility. you dont need stamina, thats what pet is for. more int=more mana. you were not a noob 
---
I'd do Dwarf Priest.  Even if you're Shadow, you may very well still get a spot in raids due to Fear Ward.  If you're Holy, well, I had a lot of fun as a Holy Priest in BGs.  Granted it requires coordination (people have to protect you), but when it clicks, oh man is it fun.  I'd never roll a Warlock on Alliance.  Too many Undead on Horde basically make your #1 CC option useless.
---
Anecdotal, but when my guild started raining I was #1 in DPS as a Hunter every week.  BiS blues, max consumables, throrium arrows, best enchantments including the pain in the ass to get +8 stats on helm/pants (ZG wasn't out yet.)
---
By the time we cleared Ragnaros I was usually around #5.  By the time we cleared Nef I was probably around #10.  Thing is was still still trying just as hard and people above me weren't mailing it in but definitely not putting in as much effort as I was.  People below me definitely could have been doing more.  When rogues/Warriors/Mages/Warlocks get geared it just becomes hard to keep up because for some reason Hunter just doesn't scale as well with gear as other DPS classes.  
---
That being said if you really put in max effort you can still be competitive.  A lazy hunter is definitely going to be on the bottom though.
---
I sold an essence of fire on the AH for like 20s. I didn’t check that the regular going price was a few gold. This was back when I could barely afford an FP to winter spring or Tanaris :-/ Now i check prices for everything I post. 
---
Thats not true though. Mage, warlock, priest, pally, shaman and druid can all do DME lasher farm. Hunter can do DMN, and war can team up with a healer for DME duo runs for the same if not more gold/hr than lasher runs. So really just rogue cant take advantage of DM.
---
Actually, that's not true at all. You could petition GMs and have them reverse it.
---
I have to wonder if the damage mitigation of priests may prove more beneficial.
---
I’m not sure though, since I never properly played vanilla back in the day.
---
I would have loved for them to do a complete patch by patch version of classic, there were so many changes to talents/gear/cast times / abilities playing from 1.01 (or whatever the game started at) through to 1.12.1 would actually feel like a completely different game then the private server experience.
---
That being said, I think them doing that would have pushed the release date back into the 2021-2022 range and gosh darnit I want to play vanilla wow now.
---
Were you the 10-boxing shaman on Nathrezim - NA?
---
&gt;all the platforms I've been to seem to revolve around nostalgia.
---
The Lion's Share of posts in this sub are people asking or telling how to spec, where to grind, and what gear to go after. If you want to completely spoil the experience months before the game comes out then stick around right here and read every min/max thread.
---
You'll feel a sense of pride and accomplishment as you follow your lists and guides, telling you exactly what to do, rushing forward solo while you ignore everyone and everything around you.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
Yeah that makes sense. If you're damage, you're doing damage and not healing, if you're healing, you're healing and not doing damage. Is that what you're saying with the "all or nothing" bit? 
---
Right, but you'd be fragmenting the population. I don't know if the number of people playing classic would be able to support two or three different versions. Part of what made the original game fun was the community. You don't want to make it a ghost town. 
---
"Are you telling him he needs to learn to play coz he asked where soem bears were?"              
---
Ah thats the good ole chats I recall
---
Your colon and arteries will thank you to buy a bunch of hummus, carrot sticks, and celery. Just my suggestion since you're asking. Don't buy something that comes in a box.
---
My first major mistake on WoW was on my druid. Leveled a druid on my friend's account from 2004-2006 playing when he wasn't. I got it to level 52 before I got my own account. Started my account and made a other druid. I remember reading talent that affected "ferocious bite" but just always thought it was a level 60 skill. Well on my new druid when I learned it in the low-mid 30s w/e it was it blew my mind. I played for 2 years on a feral druid using rake, claw, and rip. I don't know how I ever survived. 
---
For longer than I'd care to admit, i equipped armor based solely on its armor stat... this means i was routinely unequipping greens for greys because "it has two more points of armor."
---
The kicker? I was a warlock. A foolish, naive, warlock.
---
Thanks for that!  Reason I’m between a lock and hunter. I like pets obviously but I like that they are both very viable in PVP and farming.  The raiding thing is what’s holding me back 
---
This will be an extremely ugly thing for Classic and there is absolutely no excuse for it other than "we don't want to pay for the infrastructure to handle that many players in a single place."
---
Their reasoning for starter zone sharding is that the large crowds will make questing and mob tagging more difficult, which arguably isn't a valid reason either since that's a natural difficulty arising from the launch of a new server and is actually true to Vanilla, but whatever. At least some people think that is excusable.
---
But sharding in the capital cities? Inexcusable.
---
What you are missing is that warriors got their talents reworked in BWL. Before that Fury was completely garbage.
---
But we will have those talents available at launch this time, so Fury will be viable right out the bat.
---
Lmao lore nerd
---
No one changes fundamentally how an aspect of the game works. You get teleported to the dungeon, a group is created for you.
---
The other increases the amount of players available to pvp against. and was added because queue times became astronomical due to faction imbalances. waiting an hour to maybe get into a game with someone you might have seen around the server is neat, but so is pvping.
---
One also existed in classic and the other didn't
---
And some basic concepts like low bagspace
---
When i was 12 i was too afraid of using my soul stone CD because i never knew when I'd need it 
---
PvP in vanilla wasn't about outgearing PvEers, it was about PvP.
---
Don't request PvE be ruined for everyone just because you want to be special.
---
Go Orc.  Two reasons.  One, stun resist is your best friend as a caster since rogues will be all over your ass.  Two, 25% of the Horde are undead and have a built in fear breaker meant to counter your #1 CC ability.
---
Yeah I was 11 or so and had a huntard. My older brother was helping me out a lot with the game and one day he stopped helping me and told me to figure shit out on my own. In the middle of killing shit in STV I suddenly couldn’t shoot my gun anymore. I tried for hours and eventually just quit playing my hunter and rolled a rogue. A few years later I found out that my brother had been buying bullets for me and I had just run out.
---
Sorry - my bad. I was just trying to make a joke. And I actually don’t know if I even used the semicolon correctly.
---
Couldnt wait to play the orc campain. Just couldnt get friend with humans in WC 1 &amp; 2, and Arthas didn't help.
---
Who doesn’t like seeing big numbers on 0 armor rats?
---
It's pretty good, but Dal'Rend set is the real pre-raid BIS.
---
I played from vanilla to bfa. I saw something mislooted maybe once in all that time. No loot trading. No tickets. Get better loot masters. If my guilds loot master misloots more than once I’m asking for a new loot master or finding a new guild who can do it correctly.
---
Nah, I was on Shadow Council.  
---
Basically, yes.  When you're doing damage, you are death incarnate but you have no utility or support capability.  When you're healing, you're basically a carebear but you are a waterfall of HP.
---
What about murky? The blizzcon pet?
---
I had previously played Knight Online and in it you had to smash button to do basic melee attack so naturally I kept smashing auto attack in WoW too. idk how far I got before my friends told me I'm an idiot... probably lvl 30 or something.
---
Also on my Warlock i didn't like using dots and sacrifice health for mana until way into tbc.
---
How much meaningful discussion can you have about something that’s been done to death a hundred times over? Art and fluff is what I subbed here for anyways. 
---
Saving up money to buy Inferno Stone from the reagent vendor on my paladin because in warcraft 3 you use the stone to summon an inferno pet...turns out it didn't work that way in WoW.
---
&gt; I could only imagine how great the fucking wotlk dungeons must look in VR.
---
Third-person distant-zoomed-out-camera VR feels like shit, and the game is really, really not designed to be viewed through first-person.
---
Yeah but not everyone can get the dalrends to drop by the time the first raid clear starts 
---
If you're talking about Naxx geared people, you only need 4 of them to kill Ony. 10 Naxx geared people would be an overkill.
---
I realize that I will be kinda gimped as an Ele/Restro hybrid.  I suppose I'm wondering if it is *viable*. Like, can I even participate in a casual raiding guild that way?
---
Right on! Yeah the camaraderie in vanilla wow is one of it’s strong points. It keeps me coming back and makes it as much a social experience as it is a game. Im honestly a bit envious you get to experience it for the first time this summer! 
---
Well said
---
I've been trying to find my Vanilla, TBC and WotLK screenshots but I think they might be lost to a reformat 🙁.
---
Umm ya. There is a reason why mage aoe grind to support those professions while leveling.
---
There’s obviously lot’s of people who are still interested in discussing it as well as over 400 poll entries. Just downvote the thread and move on.
---
[See previous dumb math](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ayx5h4/dumb_friday_math_leveling_paladin_rotation_seal/) - specifically the frontloading portion.
---
With normal weapon progression (quest drops, random drops, etc) and average +str gear along the way, paladins can reliably kill most even level mobs in 15-20 seconds with "exorcism, seal, judge, seal, wait until dead" rotation.
---
Example @ level 32:
---
|My Level|32|
---
:--|--:|
---
|Mob Level|32|
---
|Mob HP|1,185.0|
---
|Armor|1,252.0|
---
|DR|28.64%|
---
|||
---
|White DPS|48.1|
---
|DPS after DR|34.3|
---
|Exorcism|162.0|
---
|Judge|80.0|
---
|Seal DPS|13.5|
---
|HP after Exo / Judge|943.0|
---
|Time to Kill|19.7​sec|
---
19.7 seconds to kill without any buffs factored in, Dynamite, procs, crits, etc. And that's on the high end of the scale.
---
With all spells frontloaded to the first 3-5 seconds, and 80% of damage coming from autoattack / seal, mana's not an issue due to 5 sec rule regen. With no drink breaks to stop the flow, it's pretty easy to maintain 24sec per pull average.
---
And have to split the gear with 39 other players? There's really no reason to run Ony with 40 people.
---
As a Mage you spam nothing but frostbolt until AQ.  Literally one button.  Then when AQ opens up, unless you spec into improved Scorch (which is less than ideal for PVP), you are now spamming Fireball.  It's super boring.
---
As a Warlock you are almost put into the same fate with Shadowbolt, but you do throw in dots/curses/banishes from time to time.

I did this on a private server a lot of times with a lvl39 with pendulum of doom. Only I also used the foodbuff and oils that proc for extra fire and frost damage. And I used engineering aswell for grenades and stuff. It stacked so insanely that I sometimes did like 10 damage ticks in 1 swing, 1-shotting some lvl 60 clothies. I got perm banned within a week. They thought I was hacking lol. In this case the GM was a total noob for not knowing about these mechenics.
---
The word "if" is cute.
---
I'd prefer if people that can play the game 18 hours a day didn't have naxx level gear while MC is the most current content. 
---
Go as ret, most of your gear will have int on it. Don't hold 2 sets of gear as it drastically reduces the loot you can carry to vendor. You need a sword and board for tanking, maybe a high stam piece or two. Same thing with healing, 1h and shield with intellect and you'll be fine just spam FoL once you have it.
---
["Magnificent"](https://media1.tenor.com/images/ec2c0ce42c425e138794309260e8862e/tenor.gif?itemid=12367899) This is the kind of wow I want to see and play. 
---
Sorry, this was removed as being private server footage (Rule #1/#4). Please try r/wowservers.
---
Well the set is actually stronger than T1 pieces on pair with T2. So if we are talking about the whole "pvp gear". it is very very strong to have that early, and it did not exist that point. 
---
I thought shop bought items were the best in the game and you could only do 1 quest at a time. 
---
Cross-realm BGs were in vanilla. LFD wasn't. You have to be real fucking dumb if you can't figure out the difference there.
---
I got to around 50 on my warrior before I learned you could upgrade your skills at the trainer, like I had trained around lvl 10 in goldshire or whatever but didn’t pay attention or realize you’d need to do that regularly. I also sold all of my armor and shit at like lvl 20 to the armor merchant in SW, and then bought the full gray set that he sold, I’m pretty sure it was scaled mail something or soo etching like that. I wanted a helmet really bad at around level 16 and somehow heard of the shared auction house so I ran/swam all the way from SW to gadget somehow, took me like 6 hours, obviously no level 16 helmet on the auction house. My very first time playing I got the camera stuck in overhead view zoomed all the way out and couldn’t figure out how to fix it so I played in that view like it was Diablo or some shit for like an hour, then deleted the character so I could ‘fix’ the camera. I was really bad, it took me a long time to level..... my first MC my guild brought me at level 56 in full imperial, it went as you would expect, we didn’t down luci after 5 hours in case anyone was wondering.... that was my wow experience for like the first year at least hahahaha 
---
39 other players ....in your guild? 
---
"There's really no reason to run Ony with 40 people."
---
... so she dies faster
---
Yes I am thinking about that. And a lot of people will be running engineering. So having stun resist is really good against engineers too. 
---
You can definitely participate if you find the right guild. But also keep in mind that it might be pretty hard to find that guild because even guilds that are more laid back still want to make the most of their time, and it's likely that there are plenty of people who will be playing the optimal spec.
---
Also be aware that the standard 31/0/20 doesn't put all three points into threat reduction, which is a must for optimal play. 
---
I don't disagree, but "BIS" means best in slot which is a superlative
---
They aren't changing item stats, only gating them. In 1.1 item many items had completely different (read: worse) stats in 1.12.
---
Cause it rhymes with need
---
Faction change or renames* were never even in vanilla. The only thing vanilla had was server transfers, and those were very prohibitive at that.
---
\* Technically you could rename by switching servers.
---
Fleetwood Mac and Westfall for me.
---
Is AOE spells like arcane explosion not viable for some reason? And what about utility spells like polymorph?
---
That's what happens when nothing new or interesting is happening in a game. Literally every game subreddit is mostly just fanart or meme posts.
---
I was in Ironforge about 7 months after release when some guy cruised by on a Gryphon. My jaw dropped, and half the city flipped a tit. Of course it later turned out to be a bug/graphical error, but not before I and probably about 100 other players scoured both continents for a flying mount vendor... Sigh.
---
Except that vanilla dungeons have this amazing design where you are either 3 levels underleveled for the last part of them (And thus, are on a strugglebus), or 3 levels overleved (And thus, earn next to no xp for half the trash) for the first part of them.
---
Why all of my bank alts are lvl 5
---
Loved this back in the day
---
If your guild's raid of 40 splits into two 20 people raids that each defeat Ony on a different ID, the guild will receive twice as much loot each week.
---
You will essentially be buying an additional weekly raid for the low cost of a few more minutes spent fighting Ony.
---
Its BWL level gear that gets updated to ~AQ40 level gear later and only the most hard-core players will get at minimum 3 months after launch.
---
A pvp server with *sass*.
---
The thing is this is WoW in a nutshell.  Once the last content patch goes live and people start clearing it it's only a matter of time before it decays.  "no king rules forever"
---
I personally don’t plan on playing Naxx for more than a few months while other people are claiming they should be able to play on their 1.12 server until the end of time.   There ARE people who have been raiding Naxx on private servers for over a year.  95% of the people moved on to the fresh servers.
---
The solution could be to merge servers after each content release cycle to make the world feel alive again.
---
I love the feeling of getting into the zone with some music pumping in my ears just non-stop W and click through the quests as fast as possible while continually checking the map to be sure you're on the most optimal path for gaining experience.
---
Each ding another endorphin release.
---
Too bad I'm an adult now and I won't be able to play for 16 hours straight.
---
&gt; I'm wondering if the rest of the game play would be fun around that. 
---
There's loads of fun stuff for warlocks. They're neck and neck with Druids for most fun class in vanilla in my experience. The demons and mounts and the quests to get them are really immersive. And like you say, they've got a few niche things like soulstones, healthstones, manastones, and underwater breathing as well. (Yes, underwater breathing doesn't come up much, but when it does it's awesome!)
---
I’m really torn on playing a Druid as a healer when classic rolls around. I have a high preference to playing one, but based upon some complaints I’ve seen about the class, I may roll priest. Can some guys who have healed as both a priest and Druid at max level in PVE and PVP give me their reasoning as to why they have a preference of one class over the other? Thanks, dudes. 
---
I'd recommend collecting the int set and being the healer, you're way more likely to get into groups. Trying to get in as a ret people will just ignore your whisper after they shift click your name and see you're a pally. Alternatively you could try forming your own groups so that you can dps.
---
They haven't said if they are going to change stats on items halfway through the game or just leave them as is. 
---
Don't forget that you've also got your demon to keep you company as the lock as well :). 
---
I almost never used AOE spells as a Mage in Dungeons or in Raiding.  The primary use for it is during Onyxia's whelps phase.  Other than that I recall nothing of substance/regularity.
---
Polymorph, though, was the best thing in my entire toolkit in Dungeons and PVP.  Never get to use it in raids though.
---
Us... the ones on the forums and Reddit... not guys making videos beating dead horses about things we all already knew.
---
But don’t you automatically start shooting your bow when you right click something?? 
---
I turn the music off (even though it’s great) and turn ambience way up. Highly immersive. 
---
Warlock is a bit less boring due to your demon.
---
Yes. And you can accomplish exactly the same thing while killing Ony with 40 people at least the first time. 
---
1. 40 ppl kill Ony
---
2. Right before she dies, 20 people drop group (or 30, or 39 ppl in extreme case)
---
3. 20 people can kill ony again since they are not saved because they dropped group.
---
So why not kill with 40 the first time, then 35 the next time, then 30, or bring other raiders from guild to fill in? 
---
&gt;The game saw fundamental changes in the switch from Wrath to Cata (talents, soulshards, arrows, pet dynamics, threat generation, and so many more).
---
Cata talents were more similar to the "classic" talents than the current ones, they just a talent point every 2nd lvl or something I believe.
---
&gt;threat generation
---
That was already gone in Wrath. And so was mana as a resource, which was ironically added back in cata.
---
&gt;BC &amp; Wrath are still in the spirit of Vanilla both in feel and play-style whereas MoP was not.
---
To an extent, but MoP is not similar to cata either. Most classes could cast while moving in MoP, while they couldn't in cata. So thats a fundamental change right there.
---
&gt;Also MoP was not a popular expansion in comparison to the first 2 expansions.
---
I would say MoP has a pretty big following, sure maybe not as big but it will probably increase, especally if classic servers will start doing the loop. I would even personally like play cata again as its the ONLY expansion of WoW where I ever enjoyed pvp (besides vanilla wpvp).
---
&gt;It makes no sense to creat entirely new zones that only Naxx raiders can access and raid in.
---
But Nax was released when "nobody" had cleared AQ40 anyways, so it was not accessible content at all.
---
&gt; It also wouldnt make sense to make new zones that Naxx raiders can steamroll either. 
---
BWL players could steamroll AQ20 when that was released, but they still had a reason to do it for some offset-pieces. And you are also assuming that everyone will be decked in Tier 3, which would absolutely not be the case.
---
&gt;The reason for "why not" is again money. Blizzard just fired 8% of its staff mostly in the community relations and game master departments in favor of automated systems at a time of record profits.
---
Nothing wrong with that, and Blizzard made better games when they were smaller anyways.
---
&gt;Why would they destroy the continuity of their current retail version which is incredibly profitable via micro transactions and risk pissing off that player base, in favor of expensive new development in which players dont want cash shops?
---
What makes you think there won't be a cashshop on classic servers?
---
&gt;Again, there is no financial motivation, or push from players to have a Cata/MoP/Legion "Classic".
---
Not right now, nope. But down the road its almost a certainty, especally when people get bored by the WotlK droughts which are inevitably coming.
---
&gt;The people who like retail wow post Cata are playing retail.
---
Yeah, thats why even Legion players despise BFA. Every expansion is different, and people have different preferences. I only like Classic, I don't want TBC, or Wrath. Some people only want Wrath, some people want MoP.
---
&gt; Everything post Cata feels like a different game.
---
Every expansion feels like a different game, obv the difference between vanilla and BFA is much more apparent. But even small steps like Legion -&gt; BFA can make the game completely different and make people nostalgic about the good ole days.
---
&gt;I've seen your complaints in other posts about faction imbalance on one of the current TBC servers, but that could be easily fixed with faction locking like Gummy did.
---
Maybe,  if they were to do TBC. But another with that expansion is that its also shit as a 50/50 pop server because everyone is always in the same zone on the same mobs... with flying mounts, so if TBC server arrives I would honestly just prefer 100/0 servers and just do PvE, as thats the thing TBC is all about anyways.
---
&gt; I'm not opposed to changes like that even with Vanilla classic either.
---
I don't think it will be nearly as much of an issue on vanilla servers, as both factions have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Even shaman/pally being faction locked adds a lot of reasons to play either faction (horde has better melees, alliance have better casters. Pally are the best scaling healers etc.) and you also have the continent factor, Alliance have geographical advantages on eastern kingdom (Ironforge OP, perfectly strategically placed) and Horde has Kalimdor.  Dwarf priests having fear word (which is more reliable than tremor).
---
So since the factions are unique, and come with their own benefits there is likely to a more even spread.
---
I took the time to do it.
---
The Time per level from just grinding, 1-30 = .067x, where x = your level.
---
The time per level from 30-60 = 0.1x+2.
---
The total time is the indefinite integral from 1-60, so you have (0.067x^(2))/2 from 1-30, and (0.1x^(2))/2+2x from 30-60.
---
The total time from this is 30.08 hours to 30, and 195 hours from 30-60, so roughly 225 hours total.
---
It costs 100 mana...It is not an issue at all. I think through all my time playing vanilla-cata I never didn't have enough mana to cast it. They probably patched out the mana cost at some point but still.
---
Also isn't the skill the expensive part in 1.12? So you save like a 100g.
---
Nano seems like an extremely smart and knowledgable guy. It's a shame Staysafe and TipsOut didn't seem to listen to a word he said the entire interview.
---
THIS!!  I rolled a troll hunter in late vanilla and a belf pally in early BC.  The hunter only made it to lvl 25 or so, the pally I took all the way to 70, but on both I would just wear any gear with intellect so I could use more spells.  whoops.
---
It usually doesn't get broken almost immediately, unless somebody's screwing up. 
---
Personally I won't have a ton of time every day to play and PvP will be my main focus. If cross realm BGs are required to keep queue times bearable I'm fine with them. Cross realm BGs and Cross realm dungeons are two vastly different things.
---
Deep wounds is always allowed. It is an extremely low priority debuff that is knocked off by anything important.
---
[Here's an explanation of how the Vanilla debuff priority system works.](https://wedonotsow.shivtr.com/forum_threads/2647521)
---
Noob question but what seal do you use?
---
I leveled a hunter as a main.  My buddy rolled rogue.  Was really jealous of the cool melee shit.    
---
So, I was a melee hunter until level 30.
---
What's a good spec for healing at 60? I'm undecided. 
---
Also, with martyrdom I see people talking about /sit so you get critted more. Is that a thing?
---
I leveled a warrior grinding random mobs in ashenvale til level 20, then i figured out what was the yellow exclamation mark
---
Give me realm forums!
---
Oh sorry, didn't read the rules. I was trying to hype people for classic wow.
---
At level 25 I discovered I can spend talent points on other specs than Arms.
---
I started playing fairly young and while my English was rather good for my age it was just starting to develop, being my second language.
---
You know that dialogue option you get with Innkeepers when you want to buy/sell with them?
---
**"I want to browse your goods."**
---
Young me actually thought that meant; **"I want to slow down your gods"**. Thus causing me to never press it in fear of upsetting the Innkeeper. I did NOT want to mess with their gods, who knew how dire the consequences would be!
---
I think I got to something like level 40 before I eventually realized what it meant. Boy did I feel stupid.
---
It picks up, but I wouldn't worry about the leveling process too much, its all about the end result!
---
It is and it isn't. Paladins are the undisputed kings of spot healing; that combined with the fact that, with enough crit, they can heal almost indefinitely without Innervate because of how busted Illumination is in Vanilla, is why they do so well on meters. It would be disingenuous for me to say they aren't actually good healers as they certainly are, but they are pretty one-dimensional, both in terms of playstyle as well as what their strengths are. 
---
Me and my friend still talk about this event every time we talk about wow, since we both quit quite many years ago. its one of those unusual but fun things. sop the Gm made us pretty happy :)
---
i think one of people's biggest complaints is with TBC and all other xpacs since. you essentially closed the old world. Right now at 60, you still have reason to go to most zones. and most of the world is populated still.  If you add TBC then everyone is in shat and outland.   2006 TBC is still the same design philosophy that blizz would have had if they added it to the real world too. It is blizz trying to fix their game and add new content.  I say fix in that they've been trying to "fix" it all the time what they think is wrong at design time.
---
But if we kept some of those dungeons and philosophy's but kept them in the original wow 2 continent design and kept the professions / materials / farming spots / etc. Then you can keep the feel of the large world but still add content past naxx.  it could just be new 5 mans or 10 mans. it doesn't even HAVE to be a full blown 40 man raid (since they removed that anyway in TBC) with below naxx level gear or hybrid gear.  Or open up new zones that are in the main lands. Like Quel'thalas, grim batol / twilight highlands.  Or hell, just the dalaran barrier drops and they just put the city there and make it a new rep / quest hub.  more work done in deadwind pass. Gilneas without the worgen / scourge storyline. 
---
At that point it could just be an alternate timeline wow that sticks to the classic design.  Blizz has already introduced the concept of alternate timelines.  what happens if the draenei never came.  the blood elves were neutral.. the worgen curse never happened.  we never went to outland.. 
---
The argument that it was added in 1.12 and we’re getting 1.12 so it must be there doesn’t make any sense. They are arbitrarily taking away the honor system, certain gear, reputations, dungeons, raids. It is entirely plausible for them to not have CR bgs because those were not added until the last months of vanilla and not the experience most people had of vanilla.
---
Gotta know to hit /1 (for me, spent the first bit just with /s) 
---
He’s still making them, and keeping them faithful to the original WoW map. You’re welcome to do the same thing and then merge them all together and have it printed on canvas; I will buy it from you.
---
og vanilla requires og blizzard... which stopped existing a while ago
---
I completely agree, I just think based on the info we have, that's whats likely.  Believe me I'd love to be playing it in the lead-up to Classic, maybe they'll just drop it on us suddenly, no complaints here if that happens.
---
&gt;You'll feel a sense of pride and accomplishment as you follow your lists and guides, telling you exactly what to do, rushing forward solo while you ignore everyone and everything around you. You might as well play on an empty pserver.
---
Wasn't aware of that I've been solo-raiding this whole time. I guess my guild, the friends I've made, and all the other people I've met are just a figment of my imagination.
---
Oh, and theorycrafting equals following lvling guides apparently..
---
Thank you u/sc2noob100 and u/karmassacre for helping me with my choice. I will play lock if I get the chance to change it up from tanking. Now it just depends on my friend group.
---
You need Molten Core gear to do BWL. You need BWL gear to do AQ40. You need AQ40 gear to do Naxx. All that gear wasn't useless because it got you to the next gear. A new player to the game gets use out of all those dungeons. But TBC? You don't need MC, or BWL, or AQ40, or Naxx to do TBC and TBC gives better gear. When it comes to the progression tree TBC cuts off an entire branch.
---
I am torn between orc ele shaman, orc lock and UD mage. I will mostly pvp and do open world stuff with a very casual amount of raiding. My preferred choice is ele shaman but the mana issues they have worry me( and having to pay respects to heal pve)! I really like the idea of mage but I’m not a fan of UD and like trolls even less and was considering a lock as I get to be an orc caster! Help me reddit you are my only hope to help me stop pulling my hair out!!
---
Hey now classic was about having fun and trying new things so as long as you enjoyed it you won
---
That being said it was also a place to troll so lolnub l2p
---
this guy red dead's
---
Never heard of the /sit thing.  I don't remember specific builds, but I do remember a lot of Priests forgoing both Spirit of Redemption and Lightwell. The reasoning is that you don't want a talent that only procs when you're dead (SoR) and Lightwell was basically useless in PVP since Dots were everywhere.  
---
I said prebis option. Not bis, or top of the line prebis. 
---
Madseasonshow has quite a few Classic wow guides like what race/class/faction to pick depending if you plan to PvE or PvP etc
---
Enchanting is actually really good without even maxing it, as long as you are able to disenchant high lvl blues you can make great profits by dungeon farming. Which I did on my lock on Nost, spam stratholme UD all day erry day (best dungeon ever btw), and whenever you got something from greed rolls you would increase the value of the drop by 3-6x by disenchanting it for shards.
---
Maxing it is a pain in the ass tho, and the good patterns are hard to get. But if you do get them you can just AFK in the capital and make money easier than any other profession.
---
Dude thinks he was a ret paladin before he was a ret paladin. You were just a paladin. 
---
I don't think I ever equipped it/switched to it. I remember realizing that it was the smallest easiest thing in the world I had missed and was messing up.
---
I thought I had to learn a spell or something to get "bow ability". I think my sister told me I needed to find a weapon trainer. Idk man. just dumb kid stuff
---
I was a lvl troll 12 rogue and had almost every FP in Kalimdor. I would stealth and corpse run just to explore the entire region.
---
Bonus story: my internet/pc was so bad that it couldn't handle IF so I had to play horde. I would only go to org every four levels to sell stuff and buy skills because walking through Org would take a half hour... Also disconnecting during every flight and getting stuck on the zepplin because I couldn't load the area before the zepplin went back LOL
---
GMs and GM events were a big part of the old MMORPG games. I really hope that they make a come back with classic WoW, though it's probably wishful thinking. 
---
Just "summer 2019", nothing set yet.
---
Haha actually making this video help propel to learn more on video production videos. I use that skill now for my online business lol.
---
Thanks wow vanilla! :)
---
&gt;Tailoring will not generally help you while levelling because you'll be outleveled for anything you can craft - in general. The only real reason to take tailoring is for the BoP robes or Bloodvine set bonus. You think you'll make a lot of money selling things you make via tailoring but this is simply not the case.
---
You can make good money from selling felcloth gloves or the bloodvine sets, just check the AH prices and manage your profit.
---
Its also worth maxing tailoring for that 2% bonus crit from wearing the full bloodvine set (which is the only caster set with spell hit rating pre AQ I belive)
---
This is so dumb
---
As a hunter, I used to buy new gear every level or so, I'd base it off of which piece gave me the most armory, and which was the cheapest. I had a lot of spirit gear....
---
At level 10 or so ( I cant remember) I found the fishing trainer. I fished a few times and fount "tattered cloth"? I believe it was. Could be sold to vendors for 1 silver coin. I then started my quest for the best few days to farm tattered cloth and sell them to vendors. Only to find out a few days later that it was incredibly inefficient. Since actual materials like copper and cloth could be sold at the auction house.
---
Thanks
---
Just post when you have done them all, no need to spam every single zone in their own post and now their progress pics also.
---
For people who haven't realized and vote everything to the top, he doesn't paint these. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0jp61/rclassicwow_please_dont_turn_into_rwow/eif2x46/
---
Yeah that definitely makes sense to me. 
---
That's an impressive tactic, haven't even thought about that! I could see Blizz nerfing it in Classic, but if they don't, it's definitely going to be the best way to fight Ony.
---
Same for me with some boe that drops off of some furblog in Teldrassil. Turns out I was even more of a pleb. I deleted my character and made sure not to equip it on my next one.
---
Standards are important.  If it was in vanilla, it's fair game.
---
Personally I'm fine with all these.  The sky is not falling; we will all survive.
---
At least the fanart is better than the ceaseless horde of hype-posts that talks about how someone will name their kids after the server names or whatnot.
---
If there was no debuff cap Classic would become considerably easier than it was in retail which would upset many people (myself included)
---
Mind controlling people off cliffs is fun
---
Might get nerfed in Classic, but pretty sure this was used by top guilds to farm Ony heads so they can have world buffs for their Naxx progression runs.
---
Don’t let it affect your main leveling, only do it on your downtime.. like flights/group waiting. Once you’re 60and farming.. you’ll have ALOT of waiting.. wipes/flights/people being slow.
---
I’m doing a hunter because the pet+ auto shot can farm materials on its own. Like the slimes for the BIS healing back that’s crafted.
---
Fire elementals will be #1 farmed product since they’ll be 3-8gold each.
---
Hey, I was dealing out all kinds of RETRIBUTION... in my mind.
---
Once again I agree, and go against the apparent herd.
---
Honor system should be on launch to give an incentive to PvP (I love to farm titles while lvling) and PvP is a big part of the game. You get the mount discounts which makes it more affordable, and its just overall content. So what if some nerd gets a OP item early, he is a fucking nolifer who has grinded harder than everyone else so he deserves his shiny sword, and get ahead of the herd.
---
The opposite is also true too though. In Vanilla people stopped clearing (or even trying) in Naxx when TBC release was announced..  So people stop doing content when there isn't anything else to do and when there is something else to do.
---
Private servers are all PvP, as far as I know. That's got to kill off a lot of noob enthusiasm.
---
Thanks.  I guess at the end of the day I want a class that doesn't require respeccing period to be at its best in both PVP and PVE.  To that end, I think that eliminates Shaman for me.  Do Locks/Hunters have differing specs for PVE vs PVP? I don't think so, right?
---
When I first played WoW, I thought having a bit of everything helped. So by lvl50 I'd have a completely useless build, with points spread out all across three talent trees as a warrior.
---
It's just pointless to come in a thread dedicated to this playstyle and spout off nonsense. It's not how I will play the game, for lots of reasons, but it's fascinating to read about.
---
I have a question though...does OP plan on going back and doing these quests at high level for reputation at all? That's my biggest reason to not grind TBH.
---
I loved climbing the mountains next to Stormwind. I also had a lot of fun with some friends going underneath stormwind. It was always a fun time because you had to climb a series of boxes and make a tricky jump onto a lamp post.
---
I was thinking about watching that series again. 
---
I wish they were. One of my best memory's from raiding is when a Gm decided to invite themself to our kara raid. Never saw anything like that again unfortunately. 
---
No shit but its already super duper ultra ez with 16... so.
---
I would like to see them cancel TBC, add new content, and fade out the debuff cap in those newer raids to see what would happen. What classes would become viable, new items could be meta (proc items are a no-no in regular 40 man raids).
---
More stubbornness than ignorance, but I didn't do my intro lockpicking grind as a rogue until well after BC came out. I played for 2 solid years as a no-lockpicking rogue. And even as a 14 year old kid, I didn't care at all if I was considered useless.
---
Sell everything. Loot everything from your kills. And for god sakes loot your skinnable kills.
---
People suspect june or july 8th (ish?) 2019 but nothing is set in stone. My best guess is june, lines up well in a lot of buisness ways. 
---
Where do I even start. I started playing a Warrior when I was 10 years old and for the first few weeks I played the game I didn't understand how to do quests or turn them in, I thought you were just supposed to kill mobs. I used to click on my abilities and move around with the arrow keys, it only made sense to me and I didn't learn to use WASD until years later. I did not understand how weapon skills worked so I kept switching weapon types every few levels and I didn't understand why my attacks weren't hitting mobs and why I was dying so much. I never made a single gold piece in the game until I got paid to sign a guild charter, then I started signing guild charters all the time but didn't see a gold piece from anything else for a long time after that.
---
A 9-10year old me accidentally removed frostbolt from my action bar, and thought I lost the spell forever. I’m pretty sure I was crying when I called my cousin to tell him I had lost the spell, and he told me I could just open spellbook and put it back

There are no plans to make this subreddit text-only. We definitely understand that there's no easy fix for eliminating low-effort posts, which is why some (many? too many?) get through. We obviously are trying to keep a balance, and it's a fairly fine line, but we re-evaluate from time-to-time and make changes when we feel they're overall improvements.
---
Thanks for the input. It's appreciated and duly noted!
---
&gt;Bear in mind
---
I read this entire post assuming your pet was a bear because of this. So I guess it worked.
---
Basically PvE-wise it can be summed up like this;
---
Priest - Main healer
---
Druid - Support Healer
---
A raid will usually bring at least twice the number of Priests as Druids, but then Druids tend to not be overly plentiful although that may change come Classic.
---
Regarding PvP the difference lies more in mobility and toolkit. Priests and Shamans are the only classes with an offesive dispel, which is huge. Druids on the other hand have Travel Form, Entangling Roots and overall more tankiness with Bear Form. They excel at kiting and flag carrying.
---
Myself I always prefer Druid as I tend to find Priests somewhat boring when it comes to toolkit and class fantasy. The main thing I'd be jealous of though is Mind Control, which can be hilarious.
---
Curious what complaints you've heard. If you feel for a class strongly I'd recommend going for it no matter.
---
a 30 minute duration video would be better
---
In raids, locks will cc elementals with banish.  Not sure you can cc in other raids besides some random one offs.
---
M brought up a map.
---
Was using nothing but mini map until level 20ish (a very very long time). 
---
This gave me a good laugh holy shit. I've never seen someone delete a character after what is basically good news hahah
---
I thought you might also be interested in this if your planning to go SL to be unkillable.  This will surely make its way through the community.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3\_FkK\_Fsfk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3_FkK_Fsfk)
---
I have played Vanilla, i dont know how the dungeon changes creeped on me like this and yea you forget a lot in such a long time :D 
---
I started as a human lock. Was at about level 32 or so running around with my Imp (I was so proud of him). Was in a Gnomer group and someone said I should use my Voidwalker, I was like, "what's a Voidwalker". 
---
well that does sound appealing, you always do feel disconnected with other people in retail wow, though i did recently get help from someone finding the portal room in Ogrimmar due to me not having been to that city in a long.
---
though i will say this is a possibility for Blizz to go down another timeline for wow.
---
maybe not kill off garrosh hellscream, try again with keeping the same vision of classic wow with future expansions?
---
if i don't have to pay for another sub for classic wow i'll give it a shot, i bet the RP scene was bigger in classic too
---
No worries, tone is really hard to read online. Semicolons are tricky bastards
---
I think Blizzard should make the right decision and cancel Classic.
---
*I actually don't, I just want the OP to see how it sounds when someone says that.*
---
We should have a separate poll where you can only pick one option, to see if the results change any.
---
Don't be mean to me  
---
I had a friend tell me over and over and over again how amazing his Hanzo sword was.  It was a level 55 sword, 1.5 speed, like 35 DPS and a proc on hit that dealt like 50-100 damage or something.  He talked about it in school all the time.  He was higher level than me.  I was only like 38 when he hit 55.
---
So I was going to one up him and buy TWO Hanzo Swords.  Grinding gold, never bought other gear.  Didn't even buy mount at 40, had to save gold.  Ding 55, buy two, showing them off.  It took me about a day to realize how much they sucked because I was a Hunter...they literally might as well have been gray items, they had literally no stats!  The proc didn't even work with my bow.
---
Was pretty mad about that wasted gold for a long time and also never listened to that friend again about gear.
---
-Furiously stacking intellect on my mage, and not caring for spell damage, since it doesnt even increase my mana pool....doing so even after hit level60. 
---
Eventually i was enlightened by a fellow guild mate. :)
---
-At the very beginning using /sit to regen mana&amp;hp ...
---
-Not knowing you can drink AND eat at the same time.
---
Those were the fun times!
---
well i have to say, this reminds me of simpler times, so if anything thanks for that
---
Of course they'll classify it as a starter zone! If they think sharding is enough to solve the population problem, that problem doesn't magically end when you reach Goldshire.
---
Haha yeah... 
---
Luckily that's at like level 7. Considering how much of a noob I was that probably took like 12 hours, but if I'd been higher it would be seriously cringe-worthy.
---
Then it would be a produced video instead of a stream/poscast. Also the other guy clearly didn't watch the whole vid as TBC was only talked about for a brief time and the majority of the remaining podcast was not about TBC.
---
I levelled as Resto on my first Druid, and I only did it  solo while grinding using cat and bear form. No grouping or anything. 
---
I did this because my rogue friend had told me that Mark of the Wild is the strongest buff in the game, and I saw at level 10, that the first talent row had “improved mark of the wild”. I thought I would make the strongest buff percentage-wise even stronger, and that this would be insane. 
---
After having used first 5 talents in Resto I just continued deeper in the Resto tree. 
---
It was so painful in cat form that I typically used bear form. Would generally have to heal 1-2 times while fighting each mob, because I killed them so slowly. 
---
Right after I started playing, literally minutes after starting. I held down right mouse button to look around and eventually got the camera stuck in a top down angle. I couldn't see where the hell I was going and I actually deleted my character thinking I broke the game. I asked it in general chat after it happened on my second character and with some explanation I got the camera angle where I wanted it.
---
I've mentioned the Bloodvine set bonus, arguably the only legitimate reason to take tailoring since even the BoP recipes can be replaced when tier 2 raid content is released.
---
Speaking from years of experience, Felcloth Gloves and basically every other tailoring crafted item makes very small *marginal profit.* That is, if you compare the price of the crafted item to what you would have gotten if you just sold the mats, it's a very small difference.
---
If you're the literal first to get Felcloth Gloves or Bloodvine recipe, then that's an exception. Getting those recipes very early can get you some good profit for that period of time.
---
But you don't need to be first for anything with Herb + Alch to make great profit from server start to maturity. You can make massive profit even just with the trainer recipes.
---
Alchemy is just like printing money. People need consumes for everything, PvP, PvE, early on to late. And even extremely low level recipes like Free Action Potion or Swiftness Potion or Lesser Invisibility Potion make *huge* profits!
---
I'm honestly disappointed in myself that I went Tailoring + Enchanting during Vanilla and did the same on a pserver for a month before swapping to Alch + Herb. It sucks being poor for gold all the time. I felt so much more powerful after actually having gold just being able to buy what I want.
---
Still, especially if you're in a serious progression guild, you may be expected to have 300 tailoring at least as a warlock to help raid dps. For a mage it's not as big of a deal, it translates to ~26 spellpower depending on your gear.
---
It translates to a lot more raidwide dps on warlocks though because of Improved Shadow Bolt talent.
---
It's horrible.  Just level with dual gathering, buy the cloth gear, and then don't worry about enchants until 60.
---
Right now my level 25 priest with tailor/enchant is being funded by my main, is running my main broke, and all I've got to show for it is +3 int to weapon, +3 spirit to gloves, and +20 mana to chest (and +1 resistance to cloak).
---
I've spent less money on my 20 mage and 30 warlock combined, and I've just bought all their gear.
---
Im actually excited man! What a cool opportunity to experience such an iconic game. 
---
It effectively costs a fuckton more than 100 mana though, it cracks you into fsr at a time where you're getting double spirit, so there's also a lot of lost regen.
---
Towards the end, they get into it more, before the QnA starts iirc
---
It will regenerate.
---
You can get addons that track your mana in shapeshift form.
---
Yea, but if I'm wrong then what does that make you?
---
I knew nothing of training until level 20, addons until level 30, mounts until level 45. That’s right. I rolled a warlock and busted my ass learning how to kite enemies for days. Super conditioned from running everywhere and learned how to track down quest objectives using the map and the quest text only. 
---
you lost me at "a bajillion light years an hour".  but otherwise interesting video.  i'd watch something more if you had it (that wasn't fortnite :) )
---
Sweet! Thanks for that. I reckon I’ll probably take fathering professions and then spend a good few weeks grinding some cloth. 
---
&gt;You'll learn to spite kill some particularly bad players by not healing them on purpose (i.e. that one mage or rogue who thinks he's hot shit).
---
Can't wait for the priest call on Nefarian 😈
---
I'm not. Cross server bgs were not around for my entire year long grind to rank13. They were not added until after all my friends had taken breaks from the game and incredibly late into the games lifespan.
---
The majority of vanilla's lifespan did NOT have cross server bgs, and a true classic experience shouldn't either.
---
That’s not a bad option, been messing around with private servers a touch lately and seems mining is tougher than I remember to level. Decisions decisions...
---
After playing on feenix where they tripled the bosses health and it was still easy, nah. Vanilla raiding is gonna be easy as shit.
---
turn into 2007scape
---
To be honest the leveling process, at least to a somewhat casual player, matters a whole lot. I find many tend to downplay what is arguably one of the best parts of the game, the continual growth and progress of your character. Sure you will get this at 60 too but not as dramatic. 
---
 You will arguably put in anywhere between 6-15 DAYS of playtime just leveling. That's not an insubstantial amount of time.
---
**On the topic though**: Play what you want to play. Worry about raid spots later. If you are a good and dedicated player there will be a guild out there for you.
---
I think the saying relies on me believing your assumption, which I don't.
---
If it's a PUG, who cares.  everyone will probably need if it's BOE.  If someone in group complains, I would say...if you want it so bad buy it off AH later.
---
When I learned that you could buy upgraded versions of skills? Holy hell, the best analogy I could think of as a 6th grader was when Goku took off those training weights during a fight and was amazing. I was PvPing as a fucking Boomking with level 1 skills and doing poorer then most, but still not the worst. After I bought every skill available I was like a god. 
---
I’ve got a noob question about the debuff cap. Is it 16 unique debuffs or 16 total? For example if I had 16 warlocks and they all use corruption, is there no space for the curses etc?
---
Ha. I was being facetious trying to make a point I guess. I've got one other Classic WoW vid on my channel. Many more planned for the future as the content rolls out.
---
A final thought, and something that bugs me is being marginalized as a player because of class choice. This is something that I consider when I'm looking at fill in roles, like offtanks and the like. Obviously a 3rd tank who has to gimp dps to tank an add for a short duration of the fight, who also happens to be a great player really draws from your talent pool just to fill a need in the moment. My point being is that your skill will NEVER be marginalized by playing a shaman. You will be pushed to perform to the max of your abilities to fully leverage your kit. It's not a 2 or 3 button class, it's a 20 button constant time and micro management practice that will put your raid team leaps and bounds ahead class. Or you can be like me, who doesn't want to do the mental gymnastics during fights and would rather win the battle ahead of time through preparation. Your shadowbolts only hit as hard as you work to make them, but totems are static badassery.
---
Depends on if you actually need the rep. I'm going to level a Gnome through all the elves zones, you can bet I'll do the quest for their mounts. If I was a pally, I wouldn't care as much. Sure, vendor discount, but is it that useful? 
---
They're synergistic, but they're shit for making gold.  
---
&gt;Initially I thought tailoring plus skinning would be nice for the extra gold from leather, but having enchanting would provide me with wands without relying on AH availability/prices.
---
You're going to out level a lesser magic wand before you even get the chance to make one.  
---
Greater is a strong option 13-19, if you really want it but you have to get to 70 skill which is a pain in the dick on cloth alone on a fresh server.  You're making at least 40 brown linen robes, that's 240 linen.  12 stacks, on a fresh server.
---
But you are a priest so you can get away with healing a blackfathom deeps group at 19 to get that quest wand and just use a vendor wand until that point.
---
Whereas skinning+herbing/mining ensures you have enough gold at 40. 
---
I played healing Shaman in Vanilla. I rarely if ever used chain heal. If I stopped Healing Waves on the tank, he died. Our healers sucked. Healing meters do matter(I topped them 100% of the time by a wide margin)  They are more in depth and tougher to analyse than DPS meters. You have time spent in five second rule, overhealing, HPS, and total healing. All of these matter for a priest and druid, less so on the 5 second rule for Shaman and Paladin. 
---
Overhealing is not necessarily bad of you aren't running out of mana. I switched to Holy Paladin in Wrath (and a DPS topping frostfire mage) and overhealed a ton, but still topped total healing consistently and never OOMed.
---
Chug mana pots on CD, just like on your Mage. As a priest you will have many more tools than I did as a Shaman, so as per the specific class I can't say what it will be like (I only had a priest in 50s during vanilla) but I imagine you will be doing a lot more raid healing than I did.
---
You sound a lot like me, confident yet constantly worried. That is a sign of a good and capable player. You will enjoy healing. You will probably get a bigger ego boost from healing, bit your sense of satisfaction may suffer more if you start wiping because your healers as a whole can't keep up despite your best efforts. As a DPS it's easier to play this off and continue on your merry.
---
I say give it a shot.
---
Told my brother I made a mage and leveled it to level 12. Showed it to him and he said "Bro.. you made a warlock"
---
&gt; What would happen if there was no debuff cap in Vanilla?
---
If there is no debuff cap it's not Vanilla. So you have to choose. Do you want Vanilla or do you want something else?
---
So you don't think I assume people aren't complete retards?
---
You almost nailed it with the name "STRATIC", fatfingered the "R" tho.
---
I also deleted a night elf at level 7, but it was because all my friends said night elves are gay.
---
....Also "we are all horde dude"
---
The worst was those packs of 5 mini corehounds before the second boss in MC where the corpses would stick around until all 5 died because if you didn't kill them at the same time they'd revive.  Even after 5 were dead there was a window where you could still hit them.  Everyone using all their AoE on 5 corpses trying to pump up the numbers.
---
Ungoro...the new PVP Battleground!
---
16 total debuffs.. so if 3 warlocks use a curse and corruption. that is 6 of the 16 slots taken.   The issue comes down to priority of debuffs.  such that hunters can't use serpent sting and a variety of other examples in a 40 man raid setting (but fine to use in a 5 man, depending on the debuff that is).
---
The only way to get more substantive threads is to create them. Bring up some topics, ask some questions, get people talking about something. The problem is that this isn't a new game, we don't need to speculate on things, and in-depth guides exist for every class, spec, profession, dungeon, etc already. So you have to be a bit more creative about it if you want people to sit up and take notice. 
---
Yeah, at in Hillsbrad, Alliance have to be there so ganking is ok.  If you're a high level ganking low levels in RR as Horde, you're just being a jerk.
---
Not the lvl 58 set which was the one in the game for the majority of the expansion.
---
Private servers figured all this stuff out long time ago mate
---
and be a skinner for free extra money literally taken from the carcasses
---
My knowledge of English when I started playing basically boiled down to knowing that "slay" meant kill, so I had some "hilarious" misunderstandings like thinking dismiss meant losing my pet forever (so my way of dismissing was locking it in combat and running away), or buying things of the AH and never picking up the mail. I just thought I'd lost the bidding and didn't get the money back. 
---
It was actually super frustrating and I don't understand how I actually bothered back then. 
---
People rank usefulness typically by what they can do in a raid groupx but they typically forget their PvP tools. Druids are flag runners with decent offheals. Ret Pally and Enhancement Shamman had some decent burst. Warlock DoTs were overwhelming. There's so much nuance with PvP that people forget before going straight to Rogue, Warrior, or Mage.
---
Very viable. They are incredibly bursty and a lot of fun to play. Though they take some getting used to, what with the massive amount of different totems available to you. With a hybrid build between Elemental and Resto, usually 30/0/21, you can for sure be a force to be reckoned with both in BGs and World PvP. Throwing out heals and Chain Lightning like an electrified water hose on steroids.
---
Thanks a lot for getting back, and I'm glad to hear that.
---
:) it's all good.. that was mostly a joke.  keep it up and good luck to you! I saw your other video on the 6 phase news.  i'll sub and see what pops up in my sub feed as it coms :)
---
In raids yes.
---
In dungeons no.
---
And then you have Uldaman where the last boss is almost 10 levels higher than anything else in the instance, so even if you over level the dungeon, you're still going to get fucked by him, unless you have a really solid group.
---
Depends on if I'm judging or not and if I expect the seal to drop off before the next fight. Most of my grinding is vs undead / demons, so I might use a "exorcism, seal, judge, seal" rotation.
---
The 2 seals used are
---
- max rank Seal of Command
---
- rank 1 Seal of Command
---
Since I'm only judging once, only need max rank the first time. The proc damage is the same regardless of rank, so rank 1 is fine most of the time.
---
But if I'm grinding fast enough for exo, seal, judge, seal ----- exo judge seal ---- exo judge seal ---- exo judge seal, cause the seal never falls of, it's max rank.
---
Some people have suggested that Seal of Righteousness is better for weapons faster than 3.2, but I haven't seen anything to support it.
---
Congrats on finding my next math project, I think!
---
How were you ret without any talent points ?
---
Haha, I was in the mid 40s before I knew there was more than one talent tree
---
The mana cost are almost completely negligible. It is not a big deal at all. I never had any issues regarding the warlock mounts and manacost.
---
In any case, since the game runs on 1.12 I think learning the skill is the expensive part so the point OP made:
---
&gt;I'm doing it on my warlock cuz free mount.
---
still stands since learning the Felsteed grants you the riding skill and saves you around 90 gold.
---
Thanks for that well of info. Leveling 0-39 as arms, is it that much worse? I am hoping to do any wpvp I might come across (even if I get floored), and I hear arms is the better pvp spec?
---
I hope the honor system won't go live without bg, because if it does it will transform all the end zones into ranking zone, making it a hell to play for anyone who is behind.
---
Great point!
---
Id say its 25% healing 75% blessing and cleansing.
---
If we want the authentic wow progression experience shouldn't the correct answer be no cross-server BGs until phase 6 (in the currently proposed timeline)? Since there were cross-server BGs in Vanilla BUT they didn't exist until (I believe it was) 1.12?
---
If that isn't clear, I'm just saying since cross server BGs came out in vanilla at the same time Naxx did, I would say it *should* exist in Vanilla but *NOT* until it would have in the original content cycle: around Naxx launch.
---
I actually do agree that I don't think it should be in at launch since there was never a point (as far as I know) where (for example) MC was current top-end content AND cross-server BGs existed.
---
Looks familiar, I think ive stumbled upon his channel before. Thank you for the info!
---
Possible. I quit just before Firelands raid dropped in cata so I've been gone for more than a while. That won't fly with classic folks though.
---
I played for a solid 6 months without knowing the game had sound. The game took a whole new form when I heard my paladin's charger sound byte. 
---
Just pve heal until you have some nice plate gear with SP/healing on it. get a decent 2hander with an +Onhit spell damage. (Hand of rag legendary preferred) And go holy/reck spec and dominate world pvp
---
It wasn't classic, but In TBC when I was a kid, I made a guild and all was going well until I led a group into Karazhan.
---
I had no idea what a heroic dungeon was.
---
I think the problem lies largely in part with the community. I've had content downvoted to shit for no apparent reason. Maybe cause it wasn't a flashy meme with a snapchat filter? Not sure tbh.
---
Why is TipsOut even on this show? First of all, his name is fucking stupid. Second, he never has any real input, but as a sycophantic douche, he always has to chime in to say he agrees, and then he bails for 5 minutes and has done so on multiple occasions. 
---
When I was in Army Basic Training in 93, my Drill Sergeant always told us that the human body only needs 2 hours of sleep.
---
So let's make that 22 hours a day thank you.
---
People used to send out random invites en-mass to accomplish this. Was kind of annoying.
---
Hmm.  Counter point:  1.12 was the most populated period in vanilla's history.  Your personal experience aside, more people played under cross-realm bg than under the realm-only system.
---
I spent a lot of time trying to evade hits in melee.  Nope, they always hit.
---
When I started playing at around ~10, 11 years old I made so many mistakes.
---
First character was an Orc Warlock I got to level 8 before I couldn't find anymore quests and assumed my character was glitched so I deleted him.
---
Made a few toons before settling on a Tauren Hunter, I def made a billion mistakes but I remember I always tried to get any item "of the boar" because it I liked the ways boars looked. Yeah... I had no idea what any of the stats did.
---
On that same Tauren hunter I got pretty high into LW and Skinning but randomly ditched it one day for enchanting which I never did anything with. I was looking to try EVERYthing in WoW. After playing the game for 5.5 months I was level 30, I had no fucking clue what I was doing but it was awesome. I miss experiencing everything for the first time. 
---
I never mess up. I'm a god at this game.
---
I thought my pet's growl ability made the target attack me and not the pet so I didn't use it until level 30ish. It involved me attacking things until I pulled aggro and had to use raptor strike. I even dual wielded Butcher's Cleaver's for it that I made my friend run me through SFK for.
---
Yeah I agree with lvl cap increase. Maybe this time around every 5 levels or something?
---
I always wonder what retail will look like in 2 years from now. They just keep adding more containers each xpac, they will run out of room at some point haha
---
First toon was a rogue and I used to count my combo points in my head. Not realizing that the dots on the toon would charge up. MoD 20’s when I first realized I didn’t have to keep counting the combo points anymore. 
---
The Forums on Nostalrius/Lights' Hope websites are a good source of discussion like this. And also likely the discord class channels...
---
Personally I am a member of a theorycrafting discord but its only for warriors and based around a spreadsheet for theoretical dps parses... there are probably similar discords for the other classes if you dig on the forums I mentioned above
---
Tell 'im 
---
I had to find a macro to override the standard max zoom to zoom out even further
---
Bruh that is ballsy. Going into Orgrimmar for HKs
---
You are welcome.
---
That assumes most of those quests are worth doing in the first place. **It's no doubt the best way to level while questing.** But I think questing to supplement grinding might be more efficient than grinding to supplement questing. My way's just more boring for most people.
---
Just remember that while hunters might not be ideal for maximum dps, there is always a role for each spec/class. For instance, Spriest is pretty rough in raids because they go oom so fast, but theres usually a spot for one because of the increased shadow damage debuff they apply to enemies. Hunters are always useful for their tranquilizing shot for boss enrages. If you don't care about topping the charts and willing to put some effort into your class, I'm sure most raids will be glad to have you.
---
Expect later on when DS/Ruin becomes the preferred spec to SM/Ruin you won't have a pet out because you'll need to sac your SucBus for that 15% shadow damage. 
---
Some locks will still run with SM/Ruin to grab improved Imp in order to give the stam buff to the tank's group.
---
In the raid setting, there might be one or two occasions (maybe trash pulls or a gimmick boss) where a pally tank can work.  Pallies don't have a taunt.  Pallies will go OOM fairly quickly, unless threat isn't an issue.
---
I have 2 favorite brackets:
---
39 bracket: Because it's before mounts and lvl 40 armor upgrades, yet still has enough class evolution in skills and talents to be interesting and fair to most specs.
---
59 bracket: Pretty much full class game play, minus a few end game builds that need full talent points. Pretty much a hard cap on gear scaling. No epic mounts. You can still do AV grind decently if twinked, although you can't take part in elite mount pre-made rush groups, which are gay anyway.
---
Any class is good at those brackets. More specs mature if over certain minimum levels. I call the 19 twink bracket the Mario Cart of pvp. Some like it, I find it too simple to enjoy.
---
I remember buying coal for ten times the AH price once.
---
Mmm Apollo 
---
It really doesn't change what classes are viable at all it shakes up the top dpsers a little and gives everyone more dps but that's all. 
---
Tauren druid, finished all the quests in mulgore and decided to leave. Fuckin level 18 lizards out there fam, no way can I quest out there yet. So I farmed until I couldn't level off the lvl 12 kodo matriarchs anymore, and I could kill the thunder bitches.
---
Also ran around until about level 7 with the camera aimed straight down on me. My older brother came in and asked how it was going, notices camera angle, and adjusted it to be more horizontal. First thing I said was "look at those trees!"
---
Thanks for the post. I think I'd enjoy being the tank healer and going in with the attitude that he won't die on my watch. I suspect that would keep me driven, hah.
---
Will do!
---
Your first sentence hits home.  There's several ballache quests in vanilla that aren't even worth your time.  Like any of the distress beacon escorts.  Good god.
---
Oh I remember me and my cusin used a battery to hold down the run button lol
---
Same here.
---
"I need to sell these gear to make money for mounts."
---
Fortnite wasn't getting you any views so U hopped on the classic train to make a carbon copy of every other vanilla video out there congrats
---
I'm sure this was pretty common. 
---
But I only looked at "armor" in stats when buying new equipment. Never paid attention to 'Strenght', 'Stamina' or 'Agility' etc. Always bought the item that had highest armor, even if my first character was a Druid. 
---
I also didn't know you could inspect items up until like level 35 or something. I used to buy things on Auction house hoping it would be kick-ass looking. Only to be disappointed 95% of the times. Then I remember when someone told me you could 'CTRL + Click' to inspect. And I literally spent a good 2-3 hours inspecting things on Auctions house.
---
Nailed it.  
---
they all three have already made a vid about the new news... they are just beating it to death now
---
That's good info, thanks for replying. Are you going to be a human paladin?
---
Before classic I'm trying to decide between paladin, priest, or druid myself.   
---
My main concern with pally is it seems like a disproportionately high numbers of people say they found it boring and regretted rolling one... But I like how they apparently go longer without OOM'ing as healers, and as I plan on PvPing I'm also attracted to their durability  
---
During beta i rolled a NE hunter. I never found out hunters get a pet... I reached around lvl 20 questing in Westfall, had to kite all the mobs, so it took forever to kill a single mob ^^ 
---
During live i did however reroll hunter, ended up getting pretty good imho.

Um what? Can’t “jump on a train” if I’ve already been on it for 13 years.

I can’t have a channel with multiple games?

Also Wtf is with your salt?

I agree, the 39 and 29 bracket are my favorites. 19 is just full of rogues and hunters with no class variety. What is your favorite class at 39? I'm thinking of rolling a boomkin at 39 this go around.

I deleted a character early on because I couldn't figure out how to leave a party haha. The other guy had logged off and never left the party, so for a few days I played, trying to figure out how to quit the party. And then eventually gave up and just made a new character.
---
Meh. But most players back in the day played on PvP servers and thus the noobery persisted. 
---
The private servers are not anti-noob because they're PvP, it's because the game has been out for a decade and a half.
---
Also the people who played back then and now play on private servers are self-selecting in a way because only the people who had lots of fun (thus are more likely to be good at the game and know the mechanics, fun and being good are often intertwined for most players) are going to play the game again these years later. People who didn't enjoy the game a huge amount and quit after 5-6 months who nonetheless composed a huge chunk of the vanilla original playerbase are not likely to play private servers.
---
Additionally, private server players are also used to playing later expansion of WoW where information is far more accessible and mechanics are more broadly known. So if you grab a player in 2008 who played from vanilla through Wrath and even forgot some things about vanilla, he would still be a better overall player (given some time to adjust) than a player you grab from 2005 or 2006 who was still playing through all of vanilla.
---
Now I feel the urge to say that any time I'll be looking for a dungeon group. lol
---
I was a 60 rogue on ZG when a fellow rogue taught me what slice n dice did (20% speed increase on white damage).  I thought it was a useless skill that wasted deadly poison procs and would cause me to lose DPS mid-fight when trying to reapply poison to my daggers. 
---
@ 2 per minute for even level mobs, 113 hours max, 225 is quite a bit longer than expected. Something's off for your 30-60 math.

Arthas did nothing wrong 
---
&gt; The mana cost are almost completely negligible. It is not a big deal at all. I never had any issues regarding the warlock mounts and manacost.
---
You've never cast your warlock mount then had to mana manage before reaching 100%? You honestly expect *anyone* to believe that?
---
Beat me too it
---
Honestly what is there to discuss?  
---
There are well established BiS lists, specs and class/race/role combos, this is most likely not going to change much.   
---
If you want to play by spreadsheet all the work has been done, there is nothing to discuss anymore. 
---
In response to gear, I could see them adding alternative ways to get good gear. Not *easier* ways, just different. They could do what they did when they released T2. That gear costs a lot of gold, time, and mats, it requires going all over the world, and it requires killing a bunch of entirely new bosses, but it does not require any raid content. They could also release more BoE profession gear that requires raid-quality mats. That way people who don't want to raid themselves can pay gold to get someone else to put in the work.
---
As for the power levels of post-Naxx gear, I say make the difficulty of the content scale much faster than the power of the gear and focus more on interesting effects than on raw stat increases. It's hard to apply a numeric value to effects like "Chance on hit: Disorients the target", "When struck has a chance of reducing the attacker's movement speed", "Equip: Allows underwater breathing", or "Use: Creates a portal to Karazhan."
---
But I do think they shouldn't put a huge focus on post-Naxx gear, just a little bit here and there for the top-tier players. What they should focus on is fleshing out what comes before. I would love to see some competitive Paladin tanking and dps armor sets.
---
I died in a very high level location as a newby. I didnt know I can insta ress with the ghost girl so I kept running to my dead body, ressing, dieing after like 2 seconds, repeat. 
---
This happened for like 4 hours before I just stopped playing for the day.
---
nice strawman.  
---
BGs literally already have a system in place for matchmaking and it works fine.  Almost no one is also asking for that to be put in for PvE content (essentially what the dungeon finder would be).
---
This is flat out about trying to avoid ridiculous queue times (especially at off-times) for what is frankly a bit more of a niche part of the game vs PvE.
---
Actually, you can heal just fine. Put Blessing of Light on everyone and heal with Rank 1 Holy Light. The R1 HL will gain +210 healing on top of the base heal for only 35 mana. You dont even need intellect gear until 40+
---
So, when I started playing WoW I was used to games where you only used items in extreme emergency situations because it was hard to find stuff. 
---
I didn't use my hearthstone until I was close to cap because I thought it was a one-time use thing. I also stockpiled every potion/consumables because I wanted to save them for emergencies.
---
You can easily top DPS meters as a ret doing dungeons.  Casters suck in dungeons and are brought to heal or CC.  Once 60 mages and locks can do some good dmg but their lvling specs are usually gimping them of doing any damage.
---
I did all my chatting in /s and /y for at least the first ten levels.  Somehow I discovered whispers.  Didn't learn about /1 until at least mid-20.  Mid-20 is when I had also learned that that wasn't a dead end hallway.  I would just have to wait a few seconds and the door to the elevator would open to grant me access to the Undercity. 
---
Definitely some early Candlemass, lil bit of Blind Guardian when you make it to blackrock spire. If you're playing undead you could throw some Darkthrone in the mix. 
---
Jesus christ why do guys need to be reminded every week to JUST STACK!?!
---
When I realized I was 70 (I didn't play classic, but hey, here I am) and I haven't worked on my professions... 
---
Hell yes my time to shine! My first ever toon was an Orc warlock when I was like 11 years old. My buddy was so excited to show me around the world on his level 10 so took me all the way to Undercity before he had to log off. When he did, I had no idea how to get back to the Orc starter zone (mind you I'm MAYBE level 3.) I look around in my bags and see I have a hearthstone. I tried to left click it and nothing happens.  I right click, but I guess I was moving, so nothing happens again. I then proceed to drag it out of my bags and click. When the screen pops up that says "are you sure you want to destroy this item?" I thought it was some type of magical stone you destroy to cast the spell. So I did. 
---
I wound up leveling him up to about 20-30 before I realized you could get another Hearthstone if you set your home to a new Inn. 
---
You already don’t have a reason after you’re geared for the next one. No point in running MC if you are geared for naxx. I’ve already explained that character transfers are optional, so you can sit there and re run MC all you want in Vanilla, it’s up to you. If you’re tired of it, you can opt in to move along to something new. Vanilla should always be there.
---
Yeah and it definitely doesn't help when people try to min/max using data or experiences gained from private servers. While they are definitely good baseline of information, they are not blizzard servers and will not be 100% accurate. I feel like the min/maxing discussion will flourish once the game actually drops. It will be really cool to see too!
---
&gt;I didn't know there was a macro to increase max zoom out distance
---
You can go as a healer at levels significantly lower than the recommended instance level range. I think it was 1.7 or 1.8 where they widened the level range allowed in an instance and after I saw the patch notes I made a priest alt because I thought I could get it to 60 quick and easy (guild was having healer issues).  I did instances almost exclusively and it was very quick.  I think I did ZF first time at 29 because I remember it sucked not having poh.  I had dinged that run and then actually hearthed to train it, which I didn't usually do.  And with poh it was a cakewalk at 30.  As a healer you can just hang out in the zone and use area chat as lfg, groups form around you quickly.
---
I am not sure what exactly you are talking about, can you maybe specify what you mean?
---
And as I said in my two previous posts. You still save money with the warlock mount in any case...
---
Saving for a mount on my Hunter from levels 30-40 I decided to not waste money on arrows and pet food. I ended up not getting close to the 100g I needed for my mount, so I spent all of my gold on +STR mail armour (because, why the hell would I want to wear leather).
---
True neutral. 
---
I played since BC launched and I didn't know you could do this, until right now, lol. Since I mained a warlock, maybe I never found out because I never needed mana, so I only ever needed to eat. That's crazy though. I guess I always just assumed one would interrupt the other.
---
There is a good number of reasons why paladin tank does not work in raid environment, you should be able to find relevant posts easily. You might be able to tank occasional adds in raids, but nobody would realistically bring you for that. They do work in 5mans and even UBRS though, but it's a crutch solution where people have to play around the fact that their tank is a paladin.
---
Ret DPS by itself in raids is abyssmal and a good tank would likely  outDPS you. You can push yourself to the limit and end up somewhere like 5-10th DPS ranking in a casual guild if you minmax the shit out of it.  But generally ret requires r14/Naxx gear to **maybe** beat pre-bis blue gear rogues and furies on non-UD targets.
---
&gt; nothing naxx level
---
I'd like if there was Naxx-level gear for the other specs. It's a pity that as a Paladin if you want the highest ilvl gear you are forced to roll healer.
---
your right, the 30 minutes they did talk about TBC felt like 2 hours. It's pointless to talk about it, because 1) Blizz themselves have said that there are no plans to release it and, 2) if they do decide to release TBC it wont be 3 or more years from now... its just pointless to even talk about
---
LOL when I was playing with a few buddies when we were about level 6 some malachite dropped and I rolled need and won. I remember asking my one buddy who had been playing for awhile 'Why don't you just always roll need if you win more that way?" And him just being like "Because that's rude to do if you don;t actually need it" I didn't get the concept at all. 
---
&gt; because it matched.
---
Somehow Bliz never thought of this one outside of teir gear until, what, Wrath? 
---
Yeah these 2 things are not the same.
---
I find it hard to believe that they wouldn't also have some sort of schema management that kept up with database changes as well. I understand that the task for tracing everything back to a certain point in time would be monumental and probably not worth the investment.
---
A very few paladins will be able to raid as dps. It takes a friendly guild not entirely worried about extreme 1st wave raid progression and a VERY knowledgeable player who uses full buff stacking and proper game play.
---
Most memes for Paladin come from the pre-1.9 Paladin balance patch. The memes aren't entirely wrong, they are just mostly wrong post patch. Classic is 1.12. This is why private server Paladins (baring inaccurate emulation) perform much better through all content than they did in retail Classic.
---
This is also true for many other classes. The real Classic meta will be it's own beast once the game comes out. Everyone will have to learn this new meta even if familiar with the current private server meta.
---
Hell yeah, pump up that Demon Armor!
---
They're PVP gods, or so I've heard, I don't PVP.
---
I love the simplicity of of the healing. We're essentially a sentient (sentience debatable) HOT on the tank that never runs out of mana.
---
yes it was added with 1.4 along with honor system

---
Restofari#9177
---
49 because it's the most balanced bracket with a far lower gear gap than at 60. All classes have all of their PvP relevant class abilities, there's just a few minor differences like a cc effect here or there lasting a second less or slowing the target slightly less, that kind of thing.
---
The highest PvP rank that can be achieved at 49 is 9 and honor gains are far lower than at 60 so there aren't premades constantly farming everyone else. Premades were a huge issue on private servers that drastically lowered engagement in BGs, I hope the more casual playerbase of retail makes this less of an issue but it will always be a problem due to the way the honor system is set up.
---
I think the closer we get to classic launch the more "casual" it will get. Those people will be stuck leveling, or hit Max and be mad they can't get into progression raids as a ret pally soon enough....
---
Then there's quests that you spend like 40 minutes on and BAM, 83xp. Like... dafuq lady?
---
I like the idea of an alternate timeline. I don’t like lateral additions to the game though. I don’t want a new 60 to have 2000HP and a veteran to have 20000HP. 
---
As a warrior I sold my weapon by mistake in the valley of trials, with nary a copper to my name I spent the next few hours/days punching scorpions to death until I could afford a new vendor weapon. 
---
Arms is a better pvp spec because of Mortal Strike, a 31-pt talent at the end of the arms tree. This is not feasible until you are level 40. Arms talents are considerably worse than fury when MS is taken out of the equation, so you will do less damage in the arms tree pre-40 than the fury tree. When you hear the phrase, arms - the better pvp spec - it applies to level 60's. It's just icing on the cake that the fastest leveling spec is THE pvp spec for warriors post level 40. If they pick on you post 40, they are in for slightly more trouble. Pre-40, you are basically dead in most pvp situations. It's just the life of a warrior until we get geared then the tables turn.

A little back story, i was 14 the only games i had played we're Heroes of might and magic 2/, Settlers 2,AoE,Goldeneye/Perfect dark on the 64 and a couple of NES games. Vanilla wow was the first "Big" game i had ever played/MMO.
---
Now it was about 3 months after the release of the game just started a new High school and my friends were playing it and got me into it, Made a paladin basically just ran around auto attacking everything to death with the odd quest here and there ( Was a Male Human paladin ) , Got to westfall killing my first harvest watcher and bam green healing   
---
One hand mace dropped got super excited put that bad boy on, And then the dread kicked in, My heart sunk, I felt sick in the stomach " Oh no " I said to myself, as i noticed the soul Bound tag " I am going to be stuck with this mace at 60! where there will surely be better items! ". I swiftly deleted my level 11 paladin and made another exactly the same and levelled him slowly to 60 along side my warlock.

My recollection was though that the focus regen was only enough to use bite on cooldown - i might well be mis-remembering though - I tended to use carrion birds so maybe i preferred screech to claw
---
Asking how to learn new languages. Because languages were listed under skills, I assumed they could be learned. Apparently not. 
---
Also, I joined a Gnomeregan group as a level 9 because I assumed the quest where you kill Leper Gnomes took you into Gnomeregan. That group invite didn't last long.
---
For the first 12 levels or so I put my gear on my action bars.
---
Pretty much. If you want to do something else, you'll be forced to play more "casual".
---
I think it's a fairytale dream to think World of Warcraft will return to its pre-cata roots. I don't think we will see extra devs added to the classic team to create expansion content tailored to classic players, nor will we see the main game receive such content in any meaningful capacity.
---
That said, if classic is very successful, I personally believe we will see at least TBC and even wrath servers one day. There's also the possibility Blizzard (and/or another company) will start releasing games to tap into the kind of market games like classic/vanilla appeal to. Again, assuming classic is not only successful in the short term, but also demonstrates long-term success and interest.
---
Are you referring to premades on pservers at level 60? or at 49? If its 49, I much rather prefer when the bg is full of twinks, and not just a few stomping out the others. I know it makes most casual players not want to pvp at the lower levels.
---
Hol up 
---
Any beast you tame with a visible mana pool before taming was a "caster" after you tamed it as well. Only in Burning Crusade did they complicate it with the Nether Ray family which always had an empty mana pool that they only gained by draining your mana. You couldn't tell it was a caster until you compared its stats with your other same-level pets and there was only one kind of Nether Ray found in the Underbog dungeon that had normal stats on taming.
---
19 hunter and priest 
---
But just because it is no longer useful *for you* doesn't mean it is no longer useful. That's what I'm getting at. I'd like if new content didn't make old content useless *for everyone*. If WoW2 does become a thing I don't want content to exist within it that has no reason to exist.
---
I kind of don't think most people concerned with just having fun with whatever spec they feel like care if they can get into progression raiding. PuG's and slower, more casual guilds will probably be just fine for them.
---
There's really no sense in hating on different play styles.
---
had tailor ench on a lock and was still somehow poor 
---
TBH, it's kinda dicey to roll a class expecting to heal and getting to 60 and hating it. That's not a problem in Burning Crusade as non-healing specs for hybrid classes are way better, but it's definitely an issue for Classic. 
---
A couple things:
---
If you're wanting to stand out as a skilled player, vanilla PvE content will not enable that very well. Healer might be the best avenue to that end, but people don't recognize who is healing them except if you're assigned to a specific tank, and even then they won't recognize your skill, only that they don't die, which in 80-90% of cases, being skilled won't change. Being a skilled hunter who has to kite some mobs or bosses is maybe the most "hey look at that guy do skilled things" kind of moment in PvE. If you want to stand out, be a leader and a smart voice in your guild. The propensity to stand out in the social arena is far greater than in vanilla PvE content. 
---
I think topping dps meters makes you stand out more than healing, but not anyone bright thinks that you're skilled from your topping meters in vanilla. I raided as a mage on a private server like in 2012/2013, and was always a top 3 dps with a warrior who had Sulfuras and the rogue with the best weapons for our raid content level. How did I do it? A. Not run out of mana B. watch my threat C. press Frostbolt. That's it. It's not a skillful exercise. I had the best gear out of the other mages so my frostbolts did more damage.
---
You're a cog in a machine in vanilla. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's the reality you deal with. The person you are and the type of guildmate you are stands out far more than what you can do in a raid. 
---
I couldn’t learn bear form on my druid at lvl 10. It said I didn’t have the right ‘form’. IIRC?. (later found out that there was a quest chain...) So I made multiple druids and lvl them all to 10 and hoped for one to be the right one.
---
I'm saying that no one premades at 49 because there's no point, which is a good thing for the 49 bracket.
---
This so much. Everything was nerfed but it was ok because we had to attempt to speed run to everything before TBC dropped inevitably. Even the PvP was made easier to rank up in before the expansion, this happened some time around south parks make love not Warcraft episode aired
---
If it’s still useful to you, don’t transfer a character. At some point, your T1 2 3 gear is gonna be a simple momento. Even if naxx was the only thing to do at the end.
---
Oh hey, congrats on beating the monsters. Here's some shitty pie.
---
Back in the starting zone during my first, maybe second play session, I was grouped with a friend.  We fought a wolf, I was down in health, I ate.  He started /y'ing at me that this was no time for eating.  He thought it was an animation with nothing behind it.  
---
As a mage, he never did learn how to "not threat" properly.  Even with threat meters.  Eventually we (other friends) would let him take all the aggro he wanted, kill himself, and then finish off the pack of mobs.  The tank has a hard enough job without you wanting the best fireball crit of all time. 
---
ive seen many guilds go downhill once key healers/tanks left 
---
dps were always easily replaceable ( unless they were raid leaders)
---
Mechanical Chicken! Gotta do the chicken escort quests in Tanaris, Feralas, and Hinterlands.
---
First character ever was a tauren shaman at launch. Got all the way to 36 before someone told me I have to do class quests to get my totems... I sure was excited once I got my totems though! 
---
Funny thing about this;
---
The fastest leveling warriors use spirit and very regularly Staves on Private Servers. Spirit helps you never have to drink outside of combat, and staves often have slow speeds with high max damage (Perfect for heroic strikes etc) (example: Staff reward from Wailing Caverns)
---
It's very possible you were just ahead of your time and already minmaxing on accident LOL!!!
---
Such a good series. Brings me back to my youth. 
---
&gt; but that would made all the lore they done after obsolete.
---
I'm fine with this. It would be really interesting to see where they take us.
---
Got to level 30 as a hunter and had no idea pets could train spells. I stopped playing it becuase my pet couldn't hold aggro for more than 2 hits. Around level 40 on my pally I overheard someone talking in general about the pet spell book.
---
I purposely didn't download add-ons until I was 60 and wanted to raid.  I didn't want to ruin the world...  
---
In all actuality, naive me equated it to cheating.  Thought process was something along the lines of "if the game's programmers didn't include it, why the hell should I / anyone else be trying to best them at their own game.  
---
Then I got gatherer, threat meters, altas, titanPanel, and DBM, if that even existed back then.  Thank god for those raid warnings. 
---
Considering i played maplestory before i started wow, that was just the norm for me when i started lol
---
Took me ages to notice that you can actually keybind other things then the already predefined (1,2,3,4...).
---
I dont think so. There is just no way you got to level 38 without noticing. The game is to slow to leave an entire UI element untouched like that or to never have hit the keybind to open the talent tree.
---
But hey, you got almost 300 upvotes for posting this fabricated story so it's something.
---
Ugh, ok... my main in vanilla was a warrior.
---
First, I screwed off my gold too much while leveling and had to grind to afford a mount. Part of this involved farming cloth to make bandages, because they vendored for more than cloth...
---
Second, I liked sword spec so when I finally got the Whirlwind weapon I took the sword. Not too bad since I had a lot of fun with the extra attack procs.
---
But finally, as an Arms warrior I didn't realize that Mortal Strike was an instant attack so I refused to waste a talent point on it. Twice the rage of Heroic Strike and barely any extra damage? no thanks... took a number of levels to figure that one out. Yes, I was fighting ogres in Feralas by spamming heroic strike and hoping for sword procs. &gt;&lt;
---
Quit my paladin because he did no damage with 2h swords. Jokes on me, palas started with a 2h hammer and therefore I leveled the weapon skill on the go. Swapping to 2h at lvl 15 and I didn't have enough weapon skill to hit enemies. I came back to him after leveling a warrior to 27 though and he has been my main ever since.
---
The problem with adding the PvP system is that it adds Dishonorable Kills. There needs to be at least a small period, as there was in the early days of WoW, where city raids have no penalty, all NPCs are fair game and PvP is solely done for its own sake. It would be a betrayal of the Classic experience if there is never a period where you could raid a city without penalty.
---
I didnt realize the AH and the AH were 2 separate places. I spent my first 35 levels or so thinking I had to make it to the Arathi Highlands to buy sell and trade things. Imagine my surprise when I got there and it was just an open fucking field with 12 Raptors and a basin. I spent a few hours roaming and dying looking for some kind of player driven marketplace before whispering a guildie "hey I'm at the AH but theres no other players or a vendor that let's you buy stuff from other players or anything and I've searched the whole zone. what's wrong?" To which he replied "it's in IF" and my brain broke for a minute before realizing what a fuck up I was. Hey at least I found my first green raid portal, rep vendor and battleground instance   as a result of my complete potato brain 
---
Hahaha nice!
---
I had a similar think at the beginning and mist have ninja’ed an item during a dungeon and one of the other guys said to me “fucking ninja”!
---
At that time I was almost happy cause i thought it was cool to be a ninja! :)
---
Took me a few days to be around some guys fighting over an item and one calling the other a ninja.
---
The noob years were so great!
---
I feel like questing was only really good in TBC+ expansions. I'm a huge fan of grinding in vanilla (for the same reasons you mentioned, even the 2nd monitor BSG) not to mention you can earn more gold grinding mobs. 
---
Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you...
---
Find my comment and it'll address some of these things. I won't copy+paste for the sake of clogging up the thread.
---
But I'll say that, as a lifelong mage player, I've historically loved the idea of playing a warlock and hated actually playing warlocks in vanilla because I hate Life Tap. If the spells were just more mana efficient, and I didn't have to stop casting to emo myself, it'd be fine. Also not having spell hit in your talents is annoying.
---
But yeah. I'd recommend finding my comment. The TL;DR of it is that you'll stand out as a skilled player more as a dps class, but then again you don't stand out that much because vanilla PvE isn't a great place to show off your skill. You're one of 5 mages all hammering frostbolt in MC. The only thing separating your damage dealt is gear and managing mana. None of which is skillfull. You stand out by the person you are and being a leader in the guild, and being smart. Every vanilla private server guild I've played on, most everyone knew how to play the game and get close to the most dps they could, but the dps rankings came down 100% to who had the best gear. The warrior with Sulfuras, it turns out, does a lot of DPS. My mage, with the most +hit gear and +spell dmg gear, does the most damage. Big surprise. 
---
&gt; Oh, and theorycrafting equals following lvling guides apparently..
---
Oh I didn't know you planned on having amnesia before release. Or apparently you don't think that reducing the game to a spreadsheet is the same thing as a guide.
---
49 can be a great bracket. I didn't include it because it can be a nearly non-existent bracket unless cross-server BGs are in game.
---
Glorious. Well played
---
This was so hilarious back in the day, me and my friend would act like him as a joke and eventually it got pretty cringey when people couldn't tell if we were joking or not and we'd done it for so long we were probably just being jackasses, lol.
---
It's part of a webseries - here's the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqWFYOxjZ54) episode if you want to watch the whole thing.
---
The song is from [episode 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yb5CINrC5E) 
---
Bullshit. I tried to post the exact same thing a couple days back and they blocked it due to low effort.
---
Great stuff. Fps doug is the best. BOOM HEADSHOT!
---
A lot of people did wrong armor type when focusing on stats.  I forget when I was talked out of it.  Couldn't have been any lower than 25.  Probably mid 30s. 
---
Nice video man, falls pretty close to my story as well...! Keep it up!
---
Group of my friends (3-9 potential) are doing PVP alliance, central US time zone, looking for a guild that intends to do 40 mans, I myself am thinking of doing a prot paladin for 5 man/10 man content/aoe trash fights and then healing for fights that which that won't be useful, one compatriot is going dwarf priest, and the rest will be dps of some kind, looking for a guild that is down with the prot paladin off tank thing. Thanks. 
---
So the lady was just clickbait? Damnit it worked :(
---
I was 24 before I discovered that there was 3 talent trees
---
Thanks !
---
People poop in socks? Plastic bags makes much more sense to me
---
So many young noobs don't even know where "BOOM HEADSHOT" is from.
---
Discovered autorun in my 50s.
---
29/39 I've typically played warrior or enhancement shaman in each because I like dieing too hunters over and over. Twinking is what kept me in retail wow past cata. I've played most classes in these brackets. For classic my current plan is 29 warrior or priest 
---
Well I think that is where im going with keeping naxx-level itemization as still the max.  Keep the new content at or slightly below.  Make it a "catchup mechanic" or so.  So you don't run into that issue.  
---
Granted.. you will EVENTUALLY have to hit a wall of they can't add anymore more because every item possible exists... or they start making random "spell power rogue" sets for people to poison meme off of which I think would be rather pointless and stupid. 
---
So they can either let the game stop at 1.12.. or make a 1.13/1.14 and then stop.
---
either way I don't really think TBC is the way.
---
There is no easy answer. Blizzard explicitly left PvP out of their 6 stage plan because even they don’t know what’s best. 
---
We’ll just run with that story lol 
---
I beg to differ, there are plenty of more choices then bloodseeker who are better then any high end bow. dwarven hand cannon for example or carapace spine xbow, even heartseeker xbow is better
---
In the US Open Beta I played a Human Paladin. By the EU live launch I'd come to my senses and rolled Horde.
---
So go in between at 1.5 levels with a decent group and do the entire thing.
---
Surprised at why I want to idle grind now? Caprica Six is bae.
---
The first gold I ever made was on my level 16ish Tauren Warrior I made the gold by farming Zhevra leather that a 60 was spamming Barrens asking to buy. You know what I did with that first gold? Bought a tabard. Wasn't even in a guild but saw it was worth 1 gold so it must be cool right? 
---
Enjoy buying your dungeon blues from me and my crew.
---
I understand your concern.. if you want to prot pally why do you get a lower level itemization than naxx level.. 
---
I just think it comes down to a perception issue. people don't want to lose out on naxx being the big bad.. they don't want it to become easy and puggable because people have kara gear.  or blues of equal value (or crafted epics).   so I proposed something lesser.. either blues that are BWL or above level.. or do an AQ level 2.5 gearset that can carry into naxx with some other non-tier pieces that are itemized differently.  
---
I can agree with this, I just think BWL is too late.
---
I don’t understand the internet sometimes. The dude is literally shaming me for creating content about a game I love. Like wtf? Isn’t that what YouTube is for? 
---
I’m no where near being monetized atm nor do I care about that. I’m literally just making videos because I like talking about games and thinking about them creatively. 
---
He’s a Straight up asshole. 
---
I am pretty sure that they do, but I am sure that the guides on each spec can answer better than me. I have really only done extensive research on shaman. I actually haven't seen a class with one spec optimal for pvp and pve at the same time. 
---
When I first started playing mid-BC, my brother told me that item rolls work by "need over greed".
---
...so in my first Deadmines run, I started rolling need on everything, even 2h weapons I couldn't use. Wasn't until I rolled need on a blue weapon that the tank screamed "STOP ROLLING NEED FFS".
---
Thought healing as a resto druid was all about int int int int and int. Pesky +spell stats or mp5? Nah int int int.
---
Dude that hits waay to close to home for me haha. I started playing a little bit after WotLK (best expansion dont @ me) and I had no idea what was going on. I had played a bunch of RuneScape and my one buddy convinced me to try out WoW by saying it was basically RS with  dragons. I picked a dude to play as and lmao let me tell you the mana was off the chain. I couldnt even cast OwO. but you know how dogs is and all that. anyways a couple of weeks later i found out wait this isnt even the right room, so i switched servers (thats kind of my thing) and then woah it hit me. You could just farm for gold and all that I was a warlock at the time but back then they were called black mages (Yikes). They changed that to be called guldans which i think is cool but my dude Leroy (yes that Leroy haha) was kind of upset about the change. Anyway dude give me a shout if you want to raid, I don't really play WoW anymore but you seem cool, Id be down to hop on my 380 memeonology warklod. 
---
&gt; not to mention you can earn more gold grinding mobs.
---
Sadly, I think I'll be behind on that. Selling vendor grays takes time to run to the nearest hub! That's time wasted when I could be killing skeletons. If it's close enough, sure, but I'll likely have a "trash grays" addon to make room for the good stuff.
---
This reminds me, I aquired a Swift Zulian Tiger on my DK solo farming. It is the only one I personally ever saw drop.
---
WOTLK is the most populated period of WoW history. Should we add LFD, catch up mechanics, and flying mounts to Vanilla too?
---
Your personal experience aside, more people played under LFD, catch up mechanics, and flying mounts than not having these systems.
---
See how you're just letting history repeat itself? See how your argument makes no damn sense?
---
Something I like to do as a DIY fix to this issue is host my own private server using the Mangos core and test stuff out myself. Obviously I'm pretty limited in the fact that I am using a version of the game that isn't exactly accurate, so you have to give some room for error there, and of course you wont be able to test on a properly debuffed mod, but as a crude way of testing some things that i'm interested in getting a preliminary idea about, I spawn patchwerk in a throne room and spawn Thrall a couple of times to tank and record my results using the addons available to me. Won't give you a crystal clear picture, but you will be able to see first hand some of the things people talk about in regards to class function/disfunctionality.
---
Rolling around without a wand on my warlock for the first 20 levels on my first character.  My GF at the time who played often was like “Where is your wand” to which I replied “A wand! That would be cool! Wait...I can carry a wand?” 
---
I didn’t realize the talent screen had tabs. I was leveling as a balance Druid because I didn’t know Feral/Resto were a thing. 
---
i personally went to hyjal, old ironforge and under SW.
---
Or dont and let me have all your skins kthx!
---
I dont know if you need to speak to do old raid. Compared to todays bosses they are way simpler. And also we aready know how bosses work, i doubt they will change them. 
---
I love the *feel* of vanilla but a big part of that isn't just defined by the content, it's defined by how the content evolves over time. So for me when the content stops evolving the game stops feeling like a true vanilla experience. A server that stays at 1.12 forever loses something that makes vanilla vanilla.
---
It's a Catch-22. The game needs to change to feel like vanilla but if it changes past 1.12 it's no longer vanilla.
---
But if it's a choice between vanilla content that never changes or new content that tries to feel like vanilla, I would personally choose the latter.
---
Unfortunately no because Activision decided to lay all the GMs off and do automated tickets instead =/
---
Entering fsr is not a negligible amount of mana lost.
---
What were you saving the throwing axes for? lol 
---
Why is surrounding yourself with diverse people important for rushing content in a videogame, that sounded very real world build a wall politicy
---
My first character was a warrior, and I came straight into WoW from Diablo 2. For anyone that isn’t aware, in D2 your character has a skill tree that isn’t dissimilar to the WoW talent tree, and again you get a skill point every level, plus some extras. Thing is, in D2 when you commit a skill point it’s permanent. As in ‘oh that point is in the wrong skill and I’m level 80, better delete the character and start again’ permanent.  
---
Skip forward to me on my dwarf warrior, killing stuff in Coldridge and out into Dun Morogh. The game feels suuuper slow to me, especially coming from D2 where you’re killing 20 mobs at once by level 10, but I can’t fathom it. I found my skill trainer cause of quests, but without seeing all the skills how was I going to choose? I never got the full tree like in D2 and I’m terrified of making a mistake...  
---
Yep, I though that the skills learned from the trainer were finite and permanent, and totally didn’t know that you could get them all, that talents were a thing and even that talents could be reset.  
---
Felt pretty dumb at level 10 let me tell you...
---
I didn't do my warrior quests until I was level 50.
---
If you made this with your own hands, I'd be impressed even though there are some glaring issues in the layout. But considering you're using Inkarnate and there is some really easy to find reference to the real map online, you did a really shitty job. No offense.
---
Sure they are.  People want Classic, but want to prevent everyone else from playing their favorite expansion, are worse than the people who want only Live to exist.  Because the person who says Classic Only is not only trying to prevent me from playing the expansion I want...but they're also a hypocrite.
---
I like it for thematic reasons...love seeing those maxed out green bars too haha.
---
Well not only that, but Scholo used to be a 10 man raid dungeon. So more trash made sense in that context, but as a 5 man it was just too much. 
---
Awesome thanks for the advice. Was more specifically wondering g if anybody has seen a spreadsheet or a graph that lays it out. Obviously it wouldn't be specific in terms of price but value estimations can still be made
---
&gt;n't a choice for class
---
Vanilla had Normal, PvP, RP and RP-PvP servers. "Normal" is what people often call "PvE" these days.
---
Honestly, i thought that story was going to end up with you being a tauren or troll in elwynn :P
---
This is the internet in today’s world where you live and die by shame and upvoted/downvoted. It’s retarded. Nice video. Dislike fort nite or w.e it is, overwatch and the like but I love classic wow. See you in Azeroth. 
---
That sucks paying for a game that long. You could have avoided this by checking your bank account, no?
---
But my even bigger idiot moment was when I first played WoW at all, it was actually on a private server, a level 255 funserver, and it seemed easy enough to begin with, but I noticed that the higher level I got, the longer it took me to kill things; my damage just kept getting smaller and smaller compared to the enemy health. I did find my talent tree, but noticed that lots of things in it affected spells that I didn't even have. "Improved Fire Ward? I DON'T EVEN HAVE A FIRE WARD!!" and such.
---
I didn't know that you needed to train new ranks of skills at an NPC. My only other MMOs before this were Ragnarok and Maple Story, and in those games, you don't need to visit NPCs for skills/stats, you just open up a window and put points into stats/skills just like how talents work in WoW.
---
So here I am at level 40-something using rank 1 fireball on mobs and taking like a minute just to kill 1 mob. I quit after only an hour or so of playing.
---
oh the joy it was for me and my rogue buddy to keep a paladin Perma-stunned so they couldn't pull off the cowardly bubble hearth!
---
Couldn't figure out how to talk in chat channels. Kept asking questions and replying to people in /s and wondered why I was always getting ignored till one time some dude was close enough to me to see my chat bubble and told me how it worked. Man I felt stupid.
---
Thanks bro! Elune guide you. 
---
It is. It might not be for you but for 99% of the playerbase.
---
Mana is not really a big issue I ever cared about when leveling my WL.
---
Wotlk is outside of the scope of classic.  1.12 is inside the scope.
---
Never put subscriptions on your credit cards kids. 
---
It literally is my own dumbass fault for not checking the statements. 41 bucks or so every three months was JUST small enough not to notice with the balance I have on it.
---
Its glorious 
---
People did used to do raid PUGS back in vanilla. They often didn't go well. It wasn't so much a question of gear or skill but rather whether 39 randoms from Orgrimmar or Ironforge would listen to the one guy who knew the encounters. 
---
Nowadays, you have add-ons that walk you through every single fight. That alone will make raid pugs doable, because more players will just follow the prompts on screen. 
---
I rolled a destrolock and my friend a retpala. We had decided he was gonna 'tank' mobs and i did the most damage. This was really difficult because I was constantly harrassed and he tried to run over and help me, we didnt understand threat. 
---
We even decided that the 90+% threat ability protpalas use was the most garbage spell and should be kept off at all times because: "if u have that on, mobs from further away will run after you" 
---
As if we were safer and stealthier on the road without this turned on.
---
Also only used succubus because tiddies.
---
haha atleast you have been supporting them
---
I think Naxx should be *a* big bad but not *the* big bad. There should be other 40-man raids that are as difficult as Naxx and give equally powerful (but different) loot. There would be nothing *better* than Naxx and it would always be relevant for those Warrior tanks and Paladin healers.
---
During a dungeon while playing a warlock I was told to use my DoTs. I assumed, for some reason, he meant Rain of Fire (I guess cause the fireballs looked like dots falling from the sky? I have no clue). So I did. I Rained of Fire my heart out, especially on bosses and single target fights. I shudder to think how much CC I must have inadvertently broken. I'm sure (I hope) I was eventually kicked but I don't remember. 
---
Fuck this guy. Straight up asshole.
---
I think eventually you will see pug raids be commonly successful, but probably not until some of the content patches come out and provide stronger pre-raid gear. I don't really remember raid pugs being commonly successful until after zg came out, which provided a stepping stone toward success.
---
Sure in raids, but check out [Zalgradis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dui4J8aINXI) for what a Paladin can get up to
---
Nano: Five minute discussion about how an honor system without BGs would result in 60s camping 48+ lvl flight points 24/7 instead of Southshore/Tarren Mill battles like in vanilla because the honor gain is significantly more, and this might ruin the leveling experience for people.
---
Staysafe: Well yeah but people could just completely avoid the flight points and quest hubs while leveling
---
Nano: Yeah you're right, but it might lessen the experience for a lot of people not being able to quest without constantly been ganked by someone 12 levels higher than you for honor
---
TipsOut: You boys ready for 5 months of Tarren Mill and Southshore epic battles before they put in Battlegrounds? #nochanges
---
Nano: \*surprised pikachu face\*
---
Warlock have pretty good damage in T3 so if ur long term goal is killing KT its not a bad choice and they r not overplayed as mages specially at alliance side. 
---
I had a few friends that I introduced the game to, who thought they had to repeatedly spam T to auto attack. 
---
I’m likely to have 20-40 hours a week to play this game and I’m only going with the one toon.
---
Min maxing is simply 100% dedication and a single minded focus until you’re between tiers and shits on farm.
---
Yeah I thought the same thing, hahaha
---
Remember doing this, then one person in my guild bought the bullet and made a second account with a level 1 that would auto accept invites from guildies.  The worst part of it was if you had guild notifications on for people going on/offline!
---
Good post. And I will very often be in the raid leader role, so I’m not concerned about my guild standing. It’s more of a personal feeling of accomplishment. Regardless of meters or play ability perception, I’ll be the one organizing most of the strategy.
---
yes it was, but Ironfoe wont be the "broken" pserver version. still good thou.
---
My best friend played pally on nost. I was constantly raiding/World pvping with him as my warrior. Healing is what you're best at so be prepared for that to be your only viable roll. He even convinced the guild to let him have sulfuras but he barely used it because ret will always leave you wanting more.
---
I drank water well into my 20's as a warrior. Because I naturally thought she needed to stay hydrated. 
---
Yeah, I was hoping Blizz would do this too. I think they know how much their IPs have dwindled in value though, and they're scared to lose their cash cow. 
---
Eh it's never that hard to find a vendor, and the first investment you make should be getting big bags. Not to mention that most of the money is made from crafting mats or BOEs. 
---
Yea, I’ve read that. But T3 will be a year+ away. 
---
Okay. I’ve seen this argument too many times and it’s pretty flawed in my opinion. In order for your scenario to occur first off you need to be in a dungeon with at least 3 or 4 people who could benefit from similar enough drops to roll need on an item to even matter in the first place. I’d probably just stop her and say if you’re running a dungeon with 3 or 4 people who are going to be fighting over the same loot you’d be better off finding a new, more diverse group. The fact that one’s in this group is pretty dumb in the first place in my opinion. Secondly it requires the colluding parties to be around the same level which is reasonable, but it also requires them all to be carrying a full set of lower powered gear in their bags. Bag space is a premium to me when leveling and lugging around a full extra trash set for this specific scenario to arise seems unlikely while leveling. So maybe a group of level 60s are doing this, but I doubt many people are carrying around their main spec set, a PvP set, off spec set and this very niche trash set. Third, what exactly is the motivation for these other people to run this time-consuming dungeon, when they get no loot? Maybe they are getting paid but that’s yet another layer in this already elaborate scheme. 
---
I’m not saying that this can’t happen, but I am saying that it’s likely to be pretty rare. Furthermore, there’s nothing different between what people can do with loot trading that they couldn’t already do in vanilla that allowed exchanging loot through the use of a GM. 
---
In conclusion, it seems like this is largely preventable by running dungeons with diverse groups. Furthermore, it seems like this problem if it ever does exists, likely only exists for level 60 players and I’d hope that by level 60 you have a good enough set of reputable friends and guildies made to run a dungeon. I think loot trading or the proposal by OP is not the end of the world. Obviously, we all want something similar to vanilla, but for cost reasons, that seems unlikely. It’s much easier on Blizzard as it prevents people ninja looting and calling it an “accident that they can’t unfortunately undo”. I personally think there are much more worthwhile hills to die in like tokens than fighting about loot trading. 
---
I guess I am blessed with an analytical and inquisitive mind, I understood the global cooldown, dps, weapon timers, etc. all by lvl 10, I didn't play a melee until after I encountered guides on why slow weapons synergized with "instant cast" melee attacks but that was pretty intuitive also.
---
I've always thought this is a bit of an unfair comparison. Rank 14 is far, far more time consuming to achieve than clearing raids. Furthermore, Rank 14 is limited to a very small group of players by design, whereas guilds can clear raids every time the timer is up. In the same time as one player gets Rank 14, a guild could clear MC half a dozen times and have gotten pieces of gear for 20+ people. And frankly, so what if a player on the server has Rank 14, and you see him on the battlefield and freak out whilst everyone else has lower gear. 
---
People act as if getting raid gear and PvP gear are equivalent activities. They're very much not.  
---
I spent hours roaming around Durotar, focusing largely on Thunder Ridge and killing thunder lizards until they were grey, for some reason afraid to tread into the barrens. I would also mine copper, smelt it, turn it into common mail gear and vendor it, as my gold-getting strategy.
---
I just realized that all these maps are coming from a map-making app where you drag features around. I thought these were all hand-crafted.
---
Not better than rok though? And you get rok super fast in raiding and you will keep that as your BiS until you get lucky with xbow or if dwarf you can go larvae gun. That's literally it. that's why bow skill is amazing to have.
---
We used to bring pugs into our MC and BWL runs, they paid for items, so we could buy flasks to AQ40 progression. Maybe guilds will do the same this time also.
---
The level difference between the start and end of a dungeon is 6-8, so you're never going to be in a situation where you're getting full xp, and are also able to reasonably complete the dungeon.
---
29, everything just clicks for a Druid at 29 with feline swiftness. You can plan it right and actually have a twink without a main. Just gotta make sure you farming those deviate fish at the first opportunity and getting geared up at WC.
---
39 is also great times since you can get pimped out with an ardent custodian, plus you can get both OOC and feline swiftness (also blood frenzy).
---
For one reason or another I would stay clear of the deeprun tram until I reached lvl20 or something on my first char. I thought it would be some hell-hole down there and I was afraid of having to corpse-run. Then I noticed lowbies making it in and out of deeprun tram without issue so I thought "what the hell ..."
---
If we knew what the proc rate should be on then private servers would use that one... Fact is there just wasn't put in much testing and much theorycrafting on the item or else we would know. But of course I forgot this is /r/classicwow if anything is found out on private servers then it must be a bug. 
---
I was having problems with ClassicDB as well, but it seems to be fixed for now.
---
In BC i had a 5 man arena team (all elemental shamans) named The Electric Company. We would insta cast chain lightning the healer and 1 shot him lol we hardly ever won but it was fun.
---
That was the one mount i never got back in wrath farmed it every lock out till they removed it. Got the raptor though. ran it on my rogue once to help a guild mate and he got it on his first try lol.
---
Hope you enjoyed your stay in Orgrimmar though.
---
Try the meat.
---
I think he's asking for a place for people interested in theorycrafting:   
---
'analyzing hidden systems or underlying game code in order to glean information that is not apparent during normal gameplay.'    
---
This means talking to people who actually know why and how certain lists were made. Pre-bis and bis Lists will only get you so far in understanding why certain items are better than others and in which specific situations. They also say very little about the overall balance of gear, just a rough selection of items with very good stats.    
---
For example, the prot-warrior-prebis list is completely filled with negation gear, but makes little effort to help with threat gear. Following it completely would make you a crappy tank usually. **To really be good at your class, you have to rise above the lists and really know what you're doing. More so than you would from just playing the game on instinct, or playing it while following some basic advice in the form of lists.**    
---
Other resources on game mechanics are often muddled with bad intel that come from different game versions. It would be really helpful if there are actually people who know which mechanics changed between patches and expanions, and which mechanics Classic is most likely to follow. Maybe even specifically stating differences between private and original vanilla servers.   
---
IF classic changes the attack tables for melee, should I go for more/less hit gear?   
---
Or.. did any droprates change that would change farming places?  
---
The thing is... we've already gone down Nostalgia lane and re-experienced the game.. read the quests, watched/read lore etc.  Now we want to be the best players we can be in classic. And part of that is consulting actual resources on game machanics and analyses of these mechanics.  This is way more than what you can find on the first page of google when you type in 'Warrior pre-bis list /  Warrior tanking guide / Warrior dps rotation'  or something similar.    
---
Also, I do actually feel a sense of pride and accomplishment when I am the most valuable player in a group. Or when playing with others who also know what they're doing and have geared up properly, so we can beat the content faster than others would.
---
Isnt a huge issue, saying you have 40 ony ready raiders, having the first 20 or whatever amount stayed in group, being locked and not being able to particpate in the next raid, so you end up doing ony with 20 people anyways? Guess you could have 35 people drop, then run a 35 man raid, and keep doing it until you reach that min limit. Tons more loot possiblities but a lot of extra work and coordination 
---
Naxx isn't at release.
---
DM isn't at release.
---
BWL isn't at release.
---
AQ40 isn't at release.
---
ZG isn't at release.
---
Cross-server bgs should be at release though? Even though it wasn't at release of vanilla?
---
None of these arguments used against cross-server bgs make any sense. 
---
We didn't PUG per se but I was part of a small guild that did MC/AQ a few times with 3/4 other small guilds. I think that will definitely be smoother and likes other have said, I think PUGs at some point will be fairly smooth at doing it. 
---
Omg yes so true 
---
That's pretty cool. Thanks for sharing.

Poor op, asks about professions and just gets a thread full of one super salty warlock.
---
How to make bank with Tailoring and enchanting.
---
1. Play on launch - this is a must
---
2. smash humanoids and farm bulk cloth
---
3. power level tailoring to make the small bags
---
4. tell people you will craft bags for free ( or charge a small cost per bag crafted or even be sneaky and make people give you 1 or 2 extra linen per bag and keep the extra )
---
5. make the garbage robes to get your enchanting up to make the wand
---
6. Sell bulk wands ( these are insanely OP early on ) 
---
You're now rich as shit on day 1, selling wands for 5-6 silver a pop adds up as every caster wants a wand early.
---
then just keep enchanting as your DE bot till max level then slowly level it by running old instances get noobies to loot the cloth for you to make greens to DE. Tailoring is a must for you to level early on and you want that max asap for your healing robes or eventually Bloodvine for DPS.
---
Fucking hated those guys so much I Turned in to one myself- sparkle = loot 
---
Glad you could bake it is the best one
---
Absolutely it was. My two buddies and I would do 3 man emperor runs. (Warrior/Druid/Shaman) 
---
Orc warlock high warlord 
---
My very first character was a Night Elf Rogue. Must have started around Fall 2005. I got to level 40, was getting steamrolled by Shaman in PvP, and then decided to make a Tauren Shaman. I got the Shaman to 60 in December 2006, just before BC came out. I raided and was fairly  competitive in arenas on my Shaman during BC.
---
My only regret was thinking that the game ended at level 60 so I didn't experience the Vanilla endgame at all. I didn't really try to get a character to max level until the expansion was announced.
---
Yeah pretty much. I may go as far as saying 45 if you prioritize wanding more. I think I’d go at 40 because Shadow is so much more enjoyable and 40-45 are quite a slog. 
---
This post is pretty old so I can’t quite remember the video but I’ll try to rewatch when I get home to see. 
---
Almost like they are the same world?
---
Heh, I did that actually. My best friend and I both rolled druids. He went feral, I went balance. 
---
Honestly though, I think feral is still the most fun. 
---
At 39 you have feline swiftness, OOC, Nature's Grasp, and you can show off your Ardent Custodian. 
---
&gt; and also for new spells like a taunt for paladins.
---
I'm not sure I like this. Paladin tanks should not be buffed by simply making them more similar to Warriors. If Paladin tanks need a buff it should be a buff to what makes them different from Warriors.
---
Can’t wait to mess around with classic aimed shot again.  It was always so rewarding to blow someone up with an aimed shot-auto shot-multi shot combo. 
---
#NOCHANGES. IDGAF if I have to wait around or some shit. That's part of the community interaction. You immediately will have to start grouping and shit.
---
Yeah that is true, and its going to be very intressting once classic is out. To see all these diffrences and how many of them there are.
---
pass and let the warrior have it. It's sad that this isnt obvious 
---
Then it turns out is was just one of those stealthed panthers :)
---
If anyone can down Luci or Ony in the first week of the game then they poop in socks and deserve to be recognized and paraded for how disgusting they are.
---
We are talking about 5 days played to 60, all the time to get gear, and also being in a group of 30-40 other poop sockers.
---
But at least in Classic, if someone rounds the corner in WSG and sees 5 elemental shamans protecting the flag, you'll hear the sound of their bowels releasing.
---
Please. Most guilds killed one add at a time on Lucifron, now they kill them all at once and cleave them down. Right there you have your three times as fast.  
---
Most guilds would banish/ tank and kill Garr adds. Now they just tank all the adds in the corner and kill Garr himself. Right there is 8 times as fast, more when you consider that Garr gets tankier when each of his adds dies.   
---
So no. It isn't a simple matter of increasing DPS that increases speed of clears.   It's also better strategies, higher threat ceilings that enable more dps, playing better, SKIPPING MOBS, etc. The fast MC clear times skip alot of trash that people typically killed in Vanilla.  
---
A 2x faster clear time doesn't mean 2x the DPS. You are making a vast oversimplification and then using it to drive your entire point. Weak ass arguments.
---
&gt; There was a push back to that recently
---
If by pushback you mean the entire sub is filled with people who enjoy being bad on purpose because "hurr durr being bad is fun and if you disagree you're an elitist asshole".
---
Then, yea, you could call it a pushback. It's so fucking sad to see what has happened to the average gamer these days.
---
Haha still makes me panic every time though 
---
I only say this as taunt is a big issue for paladins in a tank swapping encounter.. such as 4h.  but their other main concern is mana management is be fine with a 4 pc set bonus on tank gear that they get some mana regen on damage taken or something too that would be unique to their playstyle. 
---
Yep got the deathcharger and the white strider from that sunwell dungeon. Not sure how I got so lucky 
---
lmao dude someone did this on Daggerspine-US in Vanilla. 
---
He actually bought the first 3 or 4 posted on the AH and just deleted them, allegedly 
---
Was that flight path always there? I leveled in darkshore and don't remember a second one in the beginning.
---
Sold a ton of bars from 20-30 level areas mining/smithing, i learned about the AH a few weeks later and almost quit cause I realized this cost me affording my mount at 40
---
a lot of the good mounts get pre-dated at 1.4 and become no longer obtainable.
---
I'm not sure what blizzards approach to this is. Can anyone fill me in?
---
Make sure you farm reputation with your factions because you need exalted to purchase their mounts.
---
rivendare's deathcharger will take a long time to earn, you may never see it and get bored of trying when you lose the roll.
---
Rofl. My ex girlfriend did that with her vanilla account back in the day. She tried to get the sub money back from blizz and they laughed at her
---
Yea you got it. A good way is one person of each class stays in raid so they have a chance at their T2 helm.
---
I came from fps games, I had no clue about mmorpgs.
---
The first class I got out of the level 20s was my druid, and I was dying to get to 40 for my mount. At around level 35/36 I ran out of quests (I think) and I just started farming the bird things in desolace.
---
However, I had no fucking clue about druids, so I never used cat or bear form. I was (I think) healing specced. I farmed the  birds by spamming moon fire, and needed to recover after pretty much every mob.
---
Iirc it took something like 6-8hours of straight braindead farming to get 40. I think I quit playing my druid around 43/44.
---
yes, but if they had added the pvp system from start of wow. Would the items have been diffrent ? The fact that it was added when it was, might had been why it had the "item-level" it had.
---
Just go to private server forums. 
---
Sorry to have offended you. I did not know you were disabled.
---
Gah, you're right I messed up.  30-60 time/level =0.1(x-30)+2.  I edited my comment with the accurate numbers, which is 135 hours /played to 60.
---
I pulled xp/level from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding_xp_grid_amount_of_mobs_you_need_to_kill/).  They diverge from your table at 30, and I can't verify that mine is accurate for 1.12, but your numbers line up with the changes made in patch 2.3, which reduced the total XP needed to 60.
---
&gt;If you don't want to be with all the players on your server and have the positive   
---
&gt;and negative interactions that come with this, that's what retail is for.
---
Wrong, that's what YOU want from retail.
---
I, however, have a social life, and while i recognize the aspect of accountability and organic communities on private servers, manipulating the population so it's guaranteed playable at launch is far more important than some delusional fantasy of an unplayable game launch.
---
I'm over arguing with you people. I take solace in that you're wrong and I'll be able to play on launch day.
---
I kick these people after giving a single passive aggressive warning "I like how we're looting while we're still in combat." 
---
You should be more worried about properly setting up your macros for alternative roles.  There’s a big difference between whacking stuff with a stick and spamming heals or holding aggro.  I’m not going to be surprised if people start doing instances and think you can faceroll them like live, then blame the healer/tank, which then gets all the worse if you’re not sure whether you’re doing things right or not. 
---
Honestly, pre-60 instances are more a fanciful luxury than anything.  Depending on the level you may be missing a critical skill, or you are only looking at a few upgrades that last a few levels.  I’d say if you HAVE to run instances, do it at about 5 levels above the level of the instances’ quests.  That will give you an edge on the elites vs the people who run them ASAP trying to net a spiffy blue or two at the earliest they can equip them.  
---
I wouldn’t even really worry about trying to tank or heal.  A properly leveled hunter pet/void walker can tank if necessary in leveling dungeons and people know how to focus things properly.  It’s really more about being smart as a group over trying to fit yourself in to the wrong role.  If you’re leveling to play your class fantasy, do what you want and do it well.  If you’re trying to get to 60, don’t do instances unless you need a break for some fun.  
---
Switching from shadow to disci as a priest on lvl46 . 
---
SLOWEST LEVELING EVER. 
---
But i grinded dungeons efficiently so i guess that was nice (done ubrs 3-heal on lvl 54 and got devout chest back when instance was 15 man).
---
This is also how guilds farm melee weapons to support having like 10 dps warriors in a raid group.
---
haha
---
I wish there was a plate version of the [Black Grasp of the Destroyer](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22194).
---
And I like when some fights have one class stand out while other fights have a different class stand out. The problem is that I currently can't think of any fights where Paladin tanks stand out.
---
It's not great. TBH, one of those coupled with a gathering professions is way more viable. And you'll get minimal utility out of tailoring or enchanting while leveling unless a super rare and in-demand recipe falls into your lap for cheap on the AH. 
---
Enchanting is terrible for leveling. You won't get enough green or blue items to disenchant and actually level up unless you live inside of dungeons. I'm planning on taking gathering professions while leveling, then dropping one for enchanting at 60. It's much easier to solo low level dungeons for disenchanting mats than to get them in groups on your way up.
---
Tailoring isn't bad. It comes at the cost of using the same materials as First Aid, so you miss out on having bandages, but Priests, Warlocks and Mages can live without those. And bags are in *very* high demand on a fresh server so you can make some decent gold off of 10-12 slotters early on.
---
PvP system was added pretty early in Vanilla, a few months after release. It should be added around the same time, then BGs added much later, just like original vanilla.
---
Dispelling viper sting.
---
I was a druid but I saw someone with a "pet" little did I know it was a voidwalker. I asked what class had pets in general chat. They told me Hunter so I rolled a Hunter even though I wanted to be a warlock. Well that Dwarf Hunter ended up being my first 60. Never did roll a Warlock...
---
But let's also bear in mind Bloodvine won't be the in game for awhile. So you're essentially missing half of the most useful end-game items for half of classic's life.
---
Spamming serpent sting on my hunter 
---
So you're saying you hope the game isn't a true authentic classic experience, ok.
---
Vanilla PvP system released without BGs, BGs actually weren't added for a very long time after the honor system.
---
Most people who are into theorycrafing are probably playing private servers
---
I'm so doing this on the official server! 
---
ZG/AQ20 will both be pugged regularly - only top guilds will have a guild scheduled 20-man raid times. Majority of guilds will require their players find a pug and obtain their 20-man gear/enchants on their own time.
---
MC - This will be pugged regularly but not until MC starts to become farm mode (i.e. when BWL patch comes out)
---
BWL - This will be rarely pugged due to the inherent difficulty and gear check (onyxia scale cloaks), could see this pugged as guilds phase out BWL for focusing on Naxx progression.
---
AQ40 - This will likely never be pugged or if it is, there will be strict gatekeeping and signup and only the best geared from several elite guilds will be prioritized. Too many retard/gear checks in here that inherently discourages any PUG success rate.
---
Naxx - Trash mobs can be pugged for their drops which are very respectable; however, trash pugs fade quickly after Naxx has been out for some time. No bosses will be killed by a PUG in most cases.
---
Voice communication is only required if you are a tank/class leader in most pugs, but being able to communicate will solidify people re-inviting you again.
---
Isn’t there a quest introducing you to your class trainer?
---
Except they won't? PvP gear got updated after AQ40 releases(in the original vanilla) and was still inferior to Naxx gear.
---
If you hadn't spent any talent points, were you really Ret? 
---
Getting stuck in a crevice, panicking, raising a GM ticket... And the GM suggesting I use my hearthstone to get out.
---
You'll fail to find a group of competent people to play with as a ret or prot pally, yes.
---
Demo shout
---
Level 29 twink bracket is my favorite. I had 2 level 29 paladins and help make/played one of every other class besides shaman for myself or family.
---
My favorite class was paladin in that bracket. Either ret or healer. I had 3 different level 29 paladins going on at during  BC/Wotlk. My first one was made during vanilla and I got as close as possible to leveling pretty much, so when BC came out and some item rewards from quests became Bis due to buffs or enchanting lvl 35, my character was lacking some of that gear. So I remade a new one to get all the quested gear and be primarily a healer. Then I made another paladin on horde side so I could play with my rivals/friends I made in that bracket. 
---
Depending on the patch/expansion most classes were viable at 29. 
---
This wasnt in WoW but it very well could have been if it were my first MMO. It happened when first making a character on Daoc, I rolled a hibernia celt druid. I was running around and all of a sudden a red mob named rowdy kills me. I send a message to my friend saying some stupid player named rowdy keeps killing me! I felt like an idiot when my friend said that was an npc lol. 
---
\&gt;  I raided with one of three guilds on my server killing bosses in Naxx... 
---
For some reason I fully understand. I shouldn't be able to. But somehow I understand. Vanilla WoW was a steep learning curve. Good game for sure. But man was it steep.
---
Yeah this show is kinda garbage to be honest. Esfand is okay, but the show overall usually has little to talk about. The guests they have are the ones who have something meaningful to say. Staysafe is just a dumb memer and Tips is a nice guy but is kinda just a Youtuber wannabe.
---
Classic needs quality content, but no one has been putting out anything worth talking about. I even think MadSeasonShow's content is kinda cheap. Entire Youtube videos that are just reading patch notes or articles from 2005 about the game while incorrectly remembering things about the game from back then, which he could find out quite easily if he spent 20 seconds googling.
---
It's just a wasteland of good, quality content. 
---
[This article](https://www.engadget.com/2012/11/09/wow-archivist-the-long-fight-for-debuff-rights/) in the WoW Archivist might interest you, it goes through old forum posts and back-and-forth between the CMs and people on the forums.

This entire thread is epic :D aaaah, the memories. Great one OP!
---
You think they’re hand written? That’s cute.
---
*Reading* "I only discovered talent points existed after dinging 38 on my Ret Paladin...." LOL Is anyone surprised?  
---
It took me until just before BfA to learn autorunning.
---
***I started playing just before Legion.***
---
This is what they do. These guys are kinda wannabe Youtubers (Esfand is okayish I guess). But they just harp on the same talking points over and over for months. 
---
Not me but a friend of mine, he was 45 level paladin and he had no idea what ironforge was or that there was an AH in there... Once I showed it to him he went in and bought everything he could lol.
---
That was at the very start of vanilla EU so no harm in not knowing what to do.
---
Me personally and thats a funny story I started as a gnome lock and cause my friends were humans I went through all the ?? level mobs to go to SW and level with them.
---
I was a paladin. Just drop a consecrate and hope it ticks them out of stealth. 
---
There's a marked difference between "Blizzard is attempting to recreate earlier WoW but might not get it quite right" and "change a bunch of shit because I'm a man-baby".
---
Your comment is the latter.
---
I used to do that but I think the passive aggressive attitude is more of a reflection of the person not being able to directly approach and resolve a conflict so they resent themselves for the anxiety and then the cat claws come out. So I tried to change and just be more direct and diplomatic (good news is you have the kick button in that scenario).
---
That might be TOO much philosophy for a wow sub but I see this very "catty" feminine passive aggressive attitude more and more in the gaming community and it seems toxic.
---
what class are you looking to play ? Maybe we can help you with making one.
---
It's just a wasteland of dull, re-iterative content.
---
&gt;Which dude?
---
Dude in the video I posted and then referenced in each of my responses to you? Nihilum fury warrior recorded during world first Kel'Thuzad kill.
---
&gt;(Shrug). Believe what you like. I don't have a time machine or videos of me doing my thing. But it's not that hard to look up an optimal rotation and execute it, or download a spreadsheet and plug values into it.
---
Essentially every retail raid video showcases people making stupid basic mistakes. Since don't seem to be capable of spotting those mistakes, I'm a bit doubtful about your ability to judge the way you played 10 years ago.
---
&gt;You're actually hurting your argument more than you are helping it. Because if the raid is doing 300% damage but the ranged DPS are still doing 100% damage, that means the melee DPS have to be doing 500% damage or something to take up the slack. Which is even more impossible.
---
That doesn't even make any sense. If you stack melee, it logically follows that half of your raid cannot be casters that are still doing 100% damage.
---
&gt;I think you are reasoning backwards from the belief that nothing about pirate server achievements can be questioned, to the conclusion that therefore even the best and fastest in real vanilla were still 33% efficient compared to the pirate server crowd. The skill ceiling just isn't that high. I don't care if the odd warrior or rogue or someone left some DPS on the table, the whole fucking raid can't have been leaving 66% of the DPS on the table if half of them are mashing one key.
---
**Exhibit A, retail Vanilla speedrun:**
---
1)12 healers, 2 shadow priests, retribution paladin, feral druid, arms warrior and an assortment of melee and casters.
---
2)Wipes at Golemagg, frequently has to ress and rebuff after boss kills.
---
3)Melee enchant their weapons with Fiery Weapon enchant, people wear purples regardless of itemization.
---
4)People don't use all available consumables and buffs.
---
5)Top DPS is a night elf dagger rogue who's doing his rotation incorrectly.
---
**Exhibit B, private server speedrun:**
---
1)8 healers, 20 warriors/rogues, a handful of hunters and 4 casters.
---
2)Doesn't wipe, run is so fast that people don't even have the time to die.
---
3)Everyone is using optimal enchants and gear.
---
4)Everyone uses all available consumables and buffs.
---
5)Top DPS is a rank 14/BWL geared human fury warrior.
---
They deserve everything they get.
---
&gt; exactly as it was
---
HAHAHAHA. Literally the first post said "we're using 1.12 as a starting point". 
---
&gt; with no care
---
Lol no, just because youre a jackass doesn't mean everyone else is.
---
\-thinking i had to put autoattack in my action bars to attack and clicking it the whole time instead of spells
---
I'm thinking of rolling a gnome Warlock:)
---
Not getting the white raptor.
---
As a huntard, I remember when my first pet owl died. The problem was that I didn't know I could revive it so I abandoned it and still feel awful about that. I went and got another owl but it just wasn't the same. 
---
My guess is people will look and see that PS were only 90% accurate and not realize how much of a compliment that is. The ego some of these "back in my day" types have when private servers are more researched and draw from people like them to begin with is stunning.
---
In your example picture I see a bunch of low effort garbage on the classic wow sub, and on the right I see high quality original artwork on the wow sub.
---
So what exactly are you trying to say here?
---
I started in late wrath, so bear with me. Truly however, I had a moment of dawning comprehension that I must be Doing it Wrong the first time I saw a hunter. They were just zooming around rapidly firing their gun at things.
---
Much, much faster than my gun could fire on my ~30ish rogue.
---
I started a hunter that day...
---
Name one version control system that automatically writes commit messages. I'll wait.
---
I’m working on a quest list for something like lore master except, you know, no achievement.  Probably also going to end up with something of a profession guide because my private server characters are hitting 150 on their professions and I forget where the next trainer is.  I wasn’t thinking of class abilities, but that’s not a bad idea.
---
In fact, I bet you couldn't even name a single version control system at all without looking one up.
---
&gt; - Thinking int was my most important stat because then I could spam arcane shot more.
---
I might be guilty of this for the same reason. I leveled MM, so whatever made Arcane Shot and Aimed Shot better, I was all about it.
---
been down this road so man times now since the announcement... ( :D )
---
Why? I was looking at cmangos (used for pservers) and it sounds like the encounter AI is in C++. Tf you want to recompile hotfixes for if you could just stick it in the database and have it reload right there 
---
Your first order of business should be coming up with a suitable name.
---
If you are going heavy pvp, and you are good, then might I suggest... Gnomortears
---
Otherwise, hmm, how about... Gnomesferatu
---
Equipping a quiver actually makes you wand faster. Didn’t realize this till 60
---
It's really not that bad. The first mobs in deadmines are like 17, if you go in with a group of level 18-22 you'll plough through the first bit and then the rest is level 18-22 which is yellow for you. If you have a tank the same level as the end boss, dps within 2 levels of end boss, and healer 5 levels of end boss I think'll you'll be fine in virtually any vanilla dungeon. And yeah, BRD/Ulda are the exceptions that aren't meant to be run in the one go anyway and generally aren't worth the effort to  run from a levelling efficiency pov, but can be fun if you aren't in a rush.
---
Totally agree with you.
---
But how about a central database to host all that has been discussed with room for further theorycrafting?
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=277
---
LOLLOLOLOLOL They show what version control system they use, CVS and SVN, neither of which automatically write change messages LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL ;)
---
For instance it'll be good to be able to check off when I can get the voidwalker quest or when I'm high enough level to start entering battle grounds. As many relevant milestones as possible for my class would be amazing. 
---
Not a whole lot of people are warm to the idea of changing anything in Vanilla Classic. Adding to it would simply become a change. I don't want to hurt those who don't want changes &amp; I absolutely agree with them. I also understand that many people had an amazing time in the next 2 expansions. Whether there's a demand there or not, I don't know. There's plenty of time in the world to come to that realization or not. If there's a demand for it, Blizzard should definitely capitalize on it no doubt. BUT, Vanilla Classic was there for a reason. They should never progress or remove Vanilla Classic. If they allow you to transfer any characters you want to new content (TBC Classic), then they don't have to remove Vanilla Classic. There WILL be a brief moment in time where leveling from 60-70 will deem your previous gear useless, but that's the nature of progression. 
---
I actually would prefer to have the highest tier of gear from Vanilla Classic at the very least get you to level 70 just fine. I'm a proponent to altering TBC and Wrath to match Vanilla style features &amp; playibility. Although they were good, they began to change things that brought us to what it is today.
---
I also think it should be Wrath first. I'm all for an alternate timeline as well.
---
This was basically me in Runescape. I had an ungodly amount of gold in the game, but never leveled up. All I did was mine, smelt, blacksmith, vendor.
---
Coincidentally, that’s exactly how I got interested in WoW. Someone tried to tell me all about their epic helm, Atiesh, etc...and my only question was “Can you mine ore? Yes? Let’s go buy it!”
---
Gnomortears lmao
---
I remember my friend's Dad asking me how I killed mobs so quickly when I was over at his house.
---
Turns out he had leveled all the way to mid 30's on a mage without realizing spell tanks could be trained higher than 1.
---
I've been a Mac user ever since they merged Unix with a pretty UI.  One of the reasons I even played WoW was because when it launched it was about the only current game that was available on the Mac.  When vanilla launched I had a map laptop as my only computer.  So my keyboard was a Mac keyboard (non standard) with a reduced set of keys (even more non standard).  My mouse was a trackpad and it did not support "right" click.
---
I didn't know about auto run for a full year because numlock was the default key for that.  (Even with the fullsized apple keyboard I later got I still didn't have that key).
---
I couldn't swim or navigate in the water because I couldn't pan the camera -- no right click.
---
So yeah when I eventually moved to Windows for gaming and had a proper two finger mouse and full sized 104 key keyboard it was like "holy shit, this is so much easier."
---
Wut? Levelling through dungeons isn't quick in any way. And no you didn't heal ZF at 29, do you mean 39, or maybe RFK?
---
Not sure if rogue or hunter.
---
level 5-6: go learn proffesions
---
level 10. Go make your voidwalker quest
---
level 10. Talents, there is a wide variety of speccs you can try, but most will tell you do play affliction.
---
level 30, there is a quest in barrens for a good robe, quite a long quest but def with it.
---
level 38-44. Shadoweave Set ( tailor crafted )
---
level 40. Free mount speak with warlock trainer in IF.
---
level 50-60 Start working on Felcloth gear, and Robe of the Winter NIght.
---
Other than that its not so much to it. you dont need much to level as warlock. Try to only spend gold on learning the abiitys you will use.
---
There is a decent guide. if it helps you: https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;t=14455
---
I personally wouldn't choose based on scarcity, if you're good you will find groups and a guild either way.
---
But I can't decide either. I was set on mage, but I started playing a lock on pserver and I'm finding it more fun, for leveling at least.
---
Ultimately (IMO of course) you just gotta pick 1) which class fantasy you like better or 2) which playstyle you think is more fun. 
---
Not that the talent points would have mattered for a lolret pally. :)
---
Well tbh what you did was a perfectly valid strategy as far as playing a hybrid is concerned. But to make it pay off you have to play druid like a korean with 12 fingers. It works. But it's so hard to get right with all the macros and the keybinding involved.
---
I didn’t know there were multiple specs until I was in the 30s-40s. Maybe not until 50; I’m not sure.
---
I was leveling a Druid and the first talent spec you open up to was balance, so that’s what I was specced. I legitimately think I was one of the only Druids on the server with hurricane.
---
I only found out when someone asked me to innervate them in some dungeon I was healing and I was like “wtf are you talking about?”
---
This map is a lie. There's plenty there to do.
---
BC was great fun! I was busy playing a warrior at the time though
---
ty ty
---
49 has the most options and flavor for all classes, 29 is acceptable if you dont want to work harder on your twink, 39 feels like a weird middle but is more balanced and tasteful as classes gain their intercept/scatter but some lack their very important ice barrier or adrenaline rush. 19 will always be a disgusting level to twink at, its the equivalent of eating cold slimy hotdogs mixed with mcdonalds food. You barely have any abilities, you completely outscale people statistically from gear, i don't see it as a difference of opinion, i see it as bad taste. Yuck how is that fun.
---
I hated TBC so i made a lot of 49 twinks to cope
---
i had:
---
a mage whos frostbolt did over 600 noncrit
---
a hunter with 1200 AP trinketed
---
Enhance shaman who could burst 3000 dmg
---
A warrior who when healed solod most of an AB team (some crazy fun world pvp on him)
---
A rogue who ambushed for 800-1k and rocked world pvp in tanaris
---
This time around if i make a twink it will be a healer who i'll have fun with before maxing out.
---
As a hunter I can 100% relate.  The dead zone was the bane of my existence.
---
First time playing Undead. Decided to visit Undercity which I'd heard about.
---
Saw the abominations and thought they were enemies, ran all the way out the ruins thinking they were chasing me. Then I searched around the whole damn thing for the entrance, while hiding from those "elite enemies".
---
Then some player just waltzed past them. Carefully tried doing the same and well... that's how I discovered Undercity is in fact under the ruins. 
---
Also i thought the green water was poisonous and would kill you. 
---
I don’t understand this meme. Why would you not simply smash the rogue with a hammer as he attempts to pierce your plate armor with tiny knives. 
---
we dont know when battleground will be added yet.
---
So you killed 1 lasher pack per run? That won't be viable in classic. What about after the 5 instance resets per hour?
---
"With content" doesnt mean "literally everything". It means things like DM not being out at launch (which is what a verbatim 1.12 patch would be). They also said they are using 1.12 as a base when they first announced. 
---
&gt; Dude in the video I posted and then referenced in each of my responses to you? Nihilum fury warrior recorded during world first Kel'Thuzad kill.
---
You could have been talking about the priest guy. Haven't seen the video, don't play an endgame warrior, only saw KT in WotLK, don't feel like I can say much about it.
---
&gt; Essentially every retail raid video showcases people making stupid basic mistakes. Since don't seem to be capable of spotting those mistakes, I'm a bit doubtful about your ability to judge the way you played 10 years ago.
---
Circular argument and a personal attack. "We make up reasons to think nobody in the world knew how to play until five minutes ago, if you can't 'spot the mistakes' that means we're right".
---
I'm getting the strong impression you only know about vanilla from videos and pirate server circlejerking. Is that about right?
---
&gt; That doesn't even make any sense. If you stack melee, it logically follows that half of your raid cannot be casters that are still doing 100% damage.
---
Unless you are in a guild that can swap out nearly 100% of their casters for melee and still have a raid, the point stands.
---
&gt; Exhibit A, retail Vanilla speedrun:
---
Exhibit A, pirate server attempt at an argument:
---
1) Make up a straw man
---
2) Make it bigger
---
3) Make it crazier
---
4) Still not big enough
---
5) Now it's stupid enough to make our argument work. Look how stupid everyone but us was! The spreadsheet was invented in 2011, the mouse in 2012 and keybindings in 2013.
---
Nah, you're right, old data. Updating mine elsewhere, but I've got 135:14:23 @ 2/min.
---
Yes. 
---
Would he be unkillable today? Or was everyone just not good then?
---
bro everything is a hunter weapon in vanilla!
---
At least yours was only locked. I made a thread asking some questions between two classes and it was locked in favor of the weekly thread, but not only that the mod deleted the 20+ good replies I had already received. I'm still salty about that. 
---
I like your way of thinking
---
Lorewise, Gnomes are forward-thinking, they save and archive their scientific discoveries, but not their own history. 
---
Did you see him standing casting some heal? Good luck healing that dmg, pal.
---
True but to be fair, the game was also balanced around no one really pushing content with a prot pally tanking. you might have a prot pally for the talents and buffs but they still healed in practice.
---
the purpose of new Dungeons could also introduce a place they shine. popular theory here on the sub is that prot pallies are great in 5 man's  just not raids. 
---
but that type of itemization is what I'd like to see if something like this were to happen.. I still don't think they will but maybe different relics, or more plate healing gear.. or leather defense gear
---
Tanks and fury warriors have a lot of overlapping gear.........
---
I think the only way to export data from the game is to pop up a window in-game with the data and then copy/paste it to wherever you want it to go. This was the only way I ever saw any addons do it. I don't remember the name of the addon but I had one that helped our guild keep record of who got loot, and at the end of the night to export the data it opened a window for copy/paste.
---
If you are looking for more automation then I think the only other way is to get the data to show up in the chat log or combat log, because the game writes those to a text file on your computer. Then you could use an external program to read the log file and grab the data you want. This is not real-time though, it only saves the log periodically or when you exit the game.
---
That's true,  but I'd want to include on the check list at what level you can enter them. 
---
I know its probably silly,  but I enjoy planning my journey to 60 and a checklist wills help with that :)
---
Got a lot of fun playing level 29 hunter
---
WSG and AB: 10-19. 19-29. 29-39. 39-49. 49-59. AV: 51-60
---
You forgot to yell, ARCANITE REAPER, HOOOO on the way down. Doesn’t matter if you don’t have it. Always yell ARCANITE REAPER, HOOOO for extra damage.
---
This. Warriors, rogues and warlocks would get a small boost. Spriests would be a bit better but still bad, hunters, shamans, druids and pallies would get a very small boost. The main difference would be overall raid dps would go up around 5-10% Overall it wouldn't change very much at all. In Classic all the DoT abilities had poor to non existent scaling so they are never going to be a huge source of dps late game.

---
Which do you recommend and why?
---
I'm likely gonna focus on 5mans, world PvP and some BG. Mayyyyybe some softcore raiding. T0.5 will likely be one of my main goals. And not unimportantly, leveling will take a significant amount of time. I will often be playing with mage and warrior friend both in PvE and PvP. Gon be horde, if it matters.
---
Shaman (elemental and/or resto)
---
My original main and the coolest class. It's also the only one of these classes I've extensively played before, so not a new experience in that sense. Unsure if imma like playing with a billion keybinds again. Pretty easy to pick up healing and int mail drops though, and offensive healer in PvP rocks. Should I pick shaman to complete the nostalgia?
---
Priest (likely disc)
---
The relative simplicity of priests speaks to me. For once, I'd love to heal and be able to cast fade. Being a dispell master seems like fun. Also being everyone's favorite healer is a great feeling. Picking up PvP gear might not be as easy while healing dungeons though. Can healing priests hold their own in 1v1 world PvP? Time to pick up this new and relatively unfamiliar healer?
---
Warlock is a complex class, with a lot to learn. Many skills and lots of utility, which I like. It is by no means a simple class, but learning all the little tricks should be great fun. Leveling as lock is of course amazing. Many, many talent builds possible with the same gear. However, not as wanted for groups like a healing shaman or priest, and competing with mage for gear. Is exploring warlock the choice to make?
---
Which would you recommend and why? Thanks! Can't wait for this summer
---
According to wowwiki   it took 2 months. That's not a long time.

---
These are Bad
---
Same with the talent points, but somewhere in the 20s.
---
Did you used to play Runescape? I did the exact same thing. In Runescape the armour/weapons you bought in a shop were the only armour in the game (for free users). The thought never occured to me that the vendor white items would be bad...? Why does the gear even exist!?
---
I get that.. listen like I said i would be surprised if they did go past naxx and it not be tbc.. but it's still fun to think about and be different.. I would TOTALLY play a classic+.. that being said I'm also super excited for regular classic.. so either way I'm happy!
---
i do think blizz needs to give us an idea of their games direction though so we can know what to expect even if just a "this is what we're thinking no solid plans".. I could see them just doing classic until naxx then basically walk away  occassioanly adding new servers and otherwise just letting it go.
---
as for wrath first that would bring a host of issues, mainly dks would be there for tbc content and that would have some balance issues. 
---
I was putting the dagger in mainland and slow sword in offhand for months on rogue 😬
---
He said he was a druid though....
---
Uhm, excuse me, what part of that comment was uncivil?
---
I still remember enthusiastically telling my equally newb wow friend we could make heaps of silver selling linen cloth to the vendors - we farmed the mine in elwynn for ages doing so.  
---
Imagine how happy I was to finally find out about the auction house, much much later.
---
Thanks! I'll keep searching for a list online until some genius can come up with a comprehensive list lol.
---
Thinking the entire class of warrior was broken, I would attack mobs and try to use heroic strike straight away, my character would say "out of rage" or "not enough rage". I always misheard it as range and thought that warriors were bugged, I rerolled warlock.
---
I was about 8 years old at the time.
---
Implement pvp honour system and bgs in phase 2. upgraded rare pvp set in phase 3. upgraded epic pvp set and weapons at the end of phase 4.
---
It doesn't come up if you aren't in the right starting area
---
alexensual is still the best classic wow content creator bar none
---
Auto attack is your friend
---
I asked someone else this in this thread the same question but I'm curious - did you play Runescape before WoW?
---
&gt;I'm curious whether my knowledge of the sub-60 dungeons will be applicable when Classic hits.
---
Why wouldn’t it be? They said they’re restoring the game back to the way it was during Vanilla. How could that possibly include the Cata era dungeon revamps. 
---
That argument legitimately makes no sense. 
---
I remember some pserver i played on long ago looking for lua programmers to make the boss scripts.
---
It doesn't make sense to store mechanics in database because mechanics are complex set of instructions. They probably have a scripting languages for all the boss and quest scripts.
---
Till this day I cant explain many bossfights from back then because I was just a healer and later on I was a tank. 
---
Either way I am just looking at unit frames or feet.
---
We don't allow people to make posts advertising their merch, sorry.
---
elitistjerks.com
---
&gt;Say I'm a Retail-only player that wants to play Classic. I'm curious whether my knowledge of the sub-60 dungeons will be applicable when Classic hits.
---
In that case it’s a better question for the retail forums. That set of players is generally more knowledgeable about the current state of the game, than classic folks. 
---
I bought all the pieces in a named set (greens) off the AH so I had a matching outfit. I was doing this maybe twice every ten levels. I got the full scarlet monestry set plus tabard and the Stormwind guard pieces which looked great. I did this all the way to 60. Luckily I was a Paly so I still got a mount.
---
I was a melee hunter... I remember trading a stupid amount of gold at about level 38 for a blue Basilisk sword that drops from a mob in Tanaris(?) from what I recall. I didn't know about mounts at that point and was so stoked to get out there and use my new sword on some mobs.
---
The systems in place are loot trading. :(
---
39 by and far.
---
Started with 30 before they added AB, made an actual 29 rogue twink and pvp'd more with him than my druid at 60.
---
Jumped on private servers and only tried twinking (zero interest in end game on those). Found 39 in general way more fun.
---
39 troll shadow priest can actually melt faces and shadow guard is amazing
---
39 feral druids do really nice shred/ambush damage while having high mobility.
---
39 hemo rogues with blind and kidney are great for being able to stun lock solo defenders to death in ab.
---
Shaman elemental and enhance become burst damage gods. You have all the Ele talents and baseline skills you need in this bracket for Ele to work and enhance with a pendulum and WF is borderline broken against players with 1200-2000hp.
---
There is no class spec in this bracket that is bad, and it isn't dominated by rogues and hunters like in 19, but far more casters become powerhouses unlike 29.
---
Still no 30 pt talents which I like, and more importantly still no mounts.
---
Holy Paladin was so OP in that bracket. I had a 29 holy pally that I would queue up with my buddies who were a lock and warrior. We could control mid 3v10 for hours. Such good times
---
It was nice seeing a vid without the heavy metal music they all had back then.
---
I always wanted to venture to the 49 bracket, but was so worried that all the effort would be put to waste since the bracket wasn't as active. I'm hoping that will be different with classic!
---
19 orc hunter! Beastly!
---
I am pretty sure major cities aren't even sharded on retail, or maybe they are just not cross server. I know anyway i can't invite a friend on another realm over to my servers org.
---
Ok, fair enough. 
---
For the future though: is it considered a "merch" even if I'm giving the template for anyone to use (print) for free and create their own stuff if they want? I'm not trying to sell anything here.
---
They retcon stuff all the time anyway.
---
I enjoyed it.  Your shoulders remind me of the summer festival
---
beautifully bad, i love it.
---
BIG SIP
---
I'm not opposed to this either, it's just know with naxx level gear how the world becomes "easy" and PVP becomes "easy" compared to lower level items even from aq that people may be opposed to introducing more of that gear to the world. 
---
Using two daggers as a combat rogue and using Sinister Strike to level from 1-60 took me almost a year. 😬😬
---
For the first 15 or so talent points, I put them in horizontally instead of vertically...on a druid.
---
Asmon puts a lot of effort into his stuff. His gear/mount competitions and dps tourneys are legit. 
---
omg you are an idiot :D
---
In my defense I was 12.... but I didn't think the +stat gear was better than gear with just armor... I was playing mage and didn't realize I should have been stacking intel instead of armor till level 30...
---
&gt; Mana is not really a big issue I ever cared about when leveling my WL.
---
You're doing it wrong then.
---
Totally, I think this false premise that the market becomes too inflated lategame is completely ridiculous and doesn't work.
---
So the worry is that new players will have a harder time because as inflation increases the gold they generate at low lvls through lvling/questing does not increase. Therefore the wages of their labor are in effect decreasing.
---
The problem with this is that the PRODUCTS of their labor are increasing in price, copper ore increasing in price and being everywhere benefits newbs. A new player won't be able to buy greens off the AH for 15 silver but he sure as heck will be able to sell that +6 monkey helmet for 15 gold to an established player who wants his rogue alt to level easy.
---
Then you have this crowd that says what if all the older players just hoard their gold and SOME goods are high in price like lotus and endgame raiding material, well that just means the market is speaking to what is valuable and how that changes and evolves over time. But that doesn't depreciate your ability to farm an epic mount unless you are depending on AH sales, in which case just farm the things that the established players need. Or sell things to other new players that will inevitably form a market underneath that one due to being locked out of that rich persons game.
---
If they hoard their gold and don't spend it, they are effectively making themselves not rich, because not using their gold = it won't make an influence. No influence means no inflation.
---
I purchased all my gear until I hit darkshore, I thought the leather gear in the vendor was the best way to get gear
---
Now tell us dishonestly 
---
Yes. You just have to put in more time to keep it current.
---
My cousin and I had a phrase for that
---
"HOW CAN YOU LOOT AT A TIME LIKE THIS" (feigns death, we were both hunters)
---
Reminder: back in the day unlike current wow, it shows your health as 0 to allies also, not just enemies.
---
fun for making a healer panic. 
---
Haha! Got your vent info, prepare to be raided, nerd! 
---
&gt; dominate world pvp
---
if paired with a warrior then yeh. 
---
Not really since you basically never run out of mana as a WL. Especially not because you are casting a 100 mana spell once in a while.
---
you'll get messages like "Igotthatreference.jpg"
---
Was AB available to those under 20? I thought you unlocked it 20 for some reason.
---
Not sure why people wouldn't want to have access to all the info we've learned over the past 15 years from experienced players and pservers about min/maxing, viable specs, BiS, etc... this idea is a great way to only run MC and Ony and wipe constantly
---
If you aren't running out of mana, you're casting too few spells.
---
My very first character ever was a rogue.  I thought that stealthing was just a cool thing that rogues did.  Until about level 35 or so when someone in a dungeon politely explained the high damage openers to me.  Ah, to be a noob again.
---
This is why you need a safe space.  Just share yours with OP so you can Discord together or w/e.
---
Considering that is how you leveled in older MMOs because quests were few and far between, it makes sense lol. 
---
My friend showed me how to vendor trash items, I kept walking back to the same guy to sell my trash cause I assumed he was the only one who wanted it. 
---
Not quite as bad as OP's but I levelled to about 40 on my undead warlock before realizing there was more than one talent tree
---
I didn’t downvote but I’m pretty sure it’s the 3/5 in Furor.
---
Yea, because that will solve the problem?
---
Not realising I could get to Kalimdor as an alliance. At like lvl 40 or something I happened to just get a boat somewhere and it took me to Kalimdor, I was absolutely amazed as I thought you had to be horde to go there and vice versa 
---
I started playing on a PVP server. So did most of the people I knew. 
---
Here you go.

Somehow he doesn't see the irony in this thread and him acting like an elitist asshole?  Eye opening stuff
---
Thanks :)
---
&gt;You could have been talking about the priest guy. Haven't seen the video, don't play an endgame warrior, only saw KT in WotLK, don't feel like I can say much about it.
---
I literally posted the video in my first response to you and then referred to it in each of my comments. How could it have been the priest guy?
---
&gt;Circular argument and a personal attack. "We make up reasons to think nobody in the world knew how to play until five minutes ago, if you can't 'spot the mistakes' that means we're right".
---
Not so much a personal attack as drawing conclusions from what you say. You for some reason shut down any time people criticize retail Vanilla raiders, yet are unable to respond to the actual substance of the criticism.
---
&gt;Unless you are in a guild that can swap out nearly 100% of their casters for melee and still have a raid, the point stands.
---
Since private server speedruns are based entirely around this and do manage to do it, the point doesn't stand.
---
&gt;Exhibit A, pirate server attempt at an argument:
---
Dude, those points are literally just describing what's happening in the 1.5 hour retail speedrun footage and contrasting it with what's happening in the footage of a private server speedrun. It's not embellished, all the points are completely factual.
---
Back in Vaniller days right clicking a mob as a hunter (and any other class i believe) triggered melee attacks, you would have to either use a opening shot / sting or have the "Shoot gun/ bow" ability on your bar to auto shoot. 
---
I spent several months on my nelf druid stuck in Teldrassil. I wasn't having a bad time though. I would sneak around on my lvl 10 drood and RP in the forest. Rarely killing anything, my mission was always to hide from other players and experience the beauty of the place. 
---
Then i made a dwarf hunter six months in and actually played up to 60.
---
86% actually.
---
And the authentic true experience includes cross-realm bgs in 1.12, which is the standard blizzard is building.  It's also the most complete version of vanilla wow that existed.  And was experienced by the most people, as I've already mentioned.
---
The argument it was bad for the game is subjective.  You're welcome to make it, but saying xrealm bgs aren't part of the classic wow experience is objectively incorrect. 
---
&gt;None of these arguments used against cross-server bgs make any sense. 
---
I agree XD
---
No. You would rarely run out of mana. You just use improved drain soul, dark pact or life tap when needed. You usually are topping yourself off with siphon life so you need to get rid off excess life anyway.
---
Also for the third time. OP is still right. Leveling a WL saves you 90g even if you get the regular mount so your initial point is flawed in any case.
---
I agree man no loot trading whatsoever
---
I'd prefer it this way and have boss HP totals go up accordingly. There's no reason to lock players into boring specs for an outdated technical reason.
---
That said, the only reason Classic will be good is because nuBlizz can't be trusted to make decisions and we're not allowing them to mahe decisions. No one wants to start the slippery slope down to changing "problematic" quests and themes. 
---
You should DEFINITELY be putting subscriptions and any other regular payments on credit cards *IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO* if you have a credit card that offers cash back or rewards points because that's free money that you're missing out on otherwise.
---
This obviously assumes that you keep track of your spending closely and that you have a credit card that gives cash back, which everyone should!
---
I used to hope for this, but I've been very doubtful they'll do it for quite some time. There's a little theorycrafting that can be done in some respects, but mostly it's a solved game and some people are going to be on the forums on trade/guild channels complaining about doing the same content for X months because it was so easy to clear in their first week or two because of them likely having some form of a nerfed boss and having 1.12 talents. Doing otherwise wouldn't make MC hardcore or anything, but it'd make it much less of a cakewalk and probably keep the player base whether casual or not more content with it, even after other raids are released.
---
Even like the Stratholme Possession thing, I remember in earlier retail vanilla that once and a while my groups would wipe on that, but pretty often at least one person would die on that fight. Later on doing it on my alt no one would ever get remotely close to dying on anything other than Rivendare. Usually by having an unideal party composition. You can argue that players were just better by then, but I think it's really both factors and not just the latter. 
---
Wow was my first MMO and first PC game. I rolled a rogue because I thought it was like a stealthy hunter. I would try and use bows and die all the time. Also wtf is a patch? 
---
&gt; No. You would rarely run out of mana. You just use improved drain soul, dark pact or life tap when needed. You usually are topping yourself off with siphon life so you need to get rid off excess life anyway.
---
Which just turns other limited resources into mana
---
I'm torn, I would prefer either BWL forever or new content/tbc. Naxx forever sounds like a nightmare honestly, as cool as it is to get new gear and such the damage gets so insane with naxx gear that its oftentimes not even fun.
---
For a long time when I was playing vanilla I had no clue there was an AH, so I would actually buy the white gear from vendors. Did it until like 30 or something. 
---
I discovered I had to go to Feralas to get to the artisan alchemist trainer... I was in my level 20s, saw the high level zones between me and my goal and decided that the best way to get to Feralas was to swim. From Ashenvale. It took more than a couple of hours... and when I actually got there I found out I had to be level 35 to be able to level my alchemy skill further.
---
But at least now I had a flightpath?
---
Very similar experience, only sort of back to front. I did fill in my talent points, up to a point......Took someone to whisper me in a dungeon to ask why I hadn't added to my talent tree. I hadn't noticed the scroll bar that showed more hahaha. I took was a paladin at the time, maybe it is a pally thing ;)
---
+1 that's a good one.
---
What is unprofessional? Calling Vanilla WoW Vanilla?
---
What?
---
I thought the starting zones were the only zone to explore... Once all mobs turned Grey, I stopped leveling and assumed this was the game.
---
But my friend found the dub morough and found out about loch modan.
---
Cringe. 
---
Fair enough. The logos being on a T-shirt triggered my "this person is selling T-shirts!" mental alert. People often make these posts without sales links, then toss a comment in later linking to their shop, which is not cool and why we are quick to shut them down.
---
This post is still very much on the edge of what we allow, but I've re-approved the post. Don't go selling stuff plz or the other mods will trash me ;_;
---
Wait... you can eat and drink at the same time? Fuck me. 
---
Improved drain soul turns which other resources into mana exactly? 
---
Life tap does turn life into mana but as I said..you are frequently topping yourself off with siphon life anyways. 
---
Besides that. You need to use mana regeneration spells regardless and using a 100 mana spell once every 3 minutes wont make a big difference overall. Maybe you arw getting to 60 twenty seconds earlier.
---
I am *shocked* that the majority of players of a game are casuals! Oh wait. That's the definition of "average."
---
Rolling need on cloth +healing gloves as a warlock in WC because it had more armor on it than what i had on.
---
&gt; Improved drain soul turns which other resources into mana exactly?
---
Time.
---
&gt; Life tap does turn life into mana but as I said..you are frequently topping yourself off with siphon life anyways.
---
IF life tap can keep you topped despite tapping, you're not pulling enough mobs.
---
Sorry but that just feels unprofessional
---
But we're not talking about casuals here, we're talking about people actively encouraging people to troll others by intentionally playing poorly.
---
Snacks? But... eating only slows you down!
---
I did this several times and it was always pretty inferior to just dropping enchanting for mining/herb. Tailoring can be pretty nice if you really want those BoP items at 60 and bags can usually always make you some decent side money. Enchanting is a pain to lvl either while lvling or at 60 and I never saw much profit out of it in vanilla when you factor in the gold sink. One of the weakest things about vanilla is the horrible profession balancing. There is very little incentive for a lot of the professions unfortunately. 
---
Exactly, I’m hearing that you die way too fast in full BiS gear.  Do the Naxx geared people just want to stomp on  un-geared people forever in PvP?  Won’t those people simply not play on that server anymore?
---
I came from Ultima Online, where if you died you dropped everything.
---
So in WoW, when I got my first green items, I was so scared of losing them that I would keep them in the bank at all times. That was until someone finally clued me in.
---
Because I want to experience something new with other people who are also new. Not to hard of a concept to grasp, if I really want any of the knowledge from the past 15 years it’s a click away.  I’m not here to be the best, just to have fun with something new. Thanks for your concern though. 
---
Murloc Holmes West &gt; East &gt; EU 
---
Thank I'm glad someone else sees it +1 my dude.
---
You can make good money selling bags though, and especially on retail vs pservers players seem to be more of pack rats and bags sell higher typically. I feel like tailoring will be a bit better than a lot of pserver players think.
---
Post theorycrafts here and ignore the nay-sayers. It's what I do. Issue there, is you have to do a lot of research yourself, then present it for everyone to pick apart and build on it. You can't just post "hey, let's talk about X"
---
Thanks for sharing!  Cant believe i never came across this back in the days. LAWL
---
&gt;Time.
---
Well, how are you getting soulstones? Also for someone who is so anal about 100 mana for a spell you cast every 3 minutes I think it is funny you wouldn't use improved drain soul since it returns a significant amount of mana. The amount of mana you recover saves you more time than the 0.5 seconds you need to spend to cast drain life.
---
&gt;IF life tap can keep you topped despite tapping, you're not pulling enough mobs.
---
Life tap isn't keeping me topped off... life tap costs health. I was talking about siphon life.
---
Again, 100 mana every couple of minutes might increase your farming speed/efficiency by around 1%. It is negligible.
---
I would like them to be available. How they are implemented depends on how classic is implemented, in my opinion. Other opinions may differ.
---
1. Assuming we get a cycling server option or new servers will occasionally open up, I would love to see them time-limited. This is my vastly preferred option.
---
2. Assuming we get a static museum piece, new servers will open up on the same content phase as the old servers if they open at all, no resets, legitimately static once the content cycle has completed, I don't think one-time events are very appropriate at all. This includes mounts, war effort, and scourge invasion, and I would prefer a way for a community driven effort to trigger them as seasonal or semi-seasonal holidays in that event. That would be more fitting for the "museum piece that will never change for newcomers to discover and enjoy for years to come". This is not my preference. I would rather see time-limited events that players can try for again once in awhile.
---
Regardless of either scenario, if memory serves until \~1.12ish the mount cost 1000 gold. The cost was sunk more into riding skill in preparation for the flying mount/skill model to make all levels of riding similar, wasn't it? I don't remember. I don't even remember if I got my epic mount in vanilla or bc lol.
---
Probably unkillable today, world first guilds were good lol
---
I think your idea of the implementation of those mounts is good.
---
Do yourself a favor and post in the LFG sticky thread. Join a casual raiding guild. It'll make your raids way more fun and rewarding, and less frustrating 
---
Definitely check out the whole web-series. It was something referenced constantly in the days before youtube (the youtube channel came later, first it was just something they filmed and uploaded to their site). 
---
Contact blizzard support. I'm not sure exactly what can be done, but I know they can check if you have logged on at all during that time. Maybe they can refund you unplayed time. 
---
I need help deciding between Warrior, Priest, and Lock. I played Vanilla as a young teen, and only got to mid 40's on my main (mage) before BC hit. So I don't have any first hand experience with raiding/max level in Vanilla, but since then I have become a HUGE HUGE HUGE min/maxer, and will primarily be interested in PVE. I may pvp with friends once my guild gets current raids on run status, but it won't be a primary concern of mine (though I will be going on a pvp server).
---
**Warrior Pros:**
---
* I can MT (Easier time gearing in raids, easier time getting into dungeons/raids)
---
* One of/the top DPS classes (For when the content gets stale, and we have almost all raids on run status I can gear DPS)
---
* Monster in PVP with a healer (and my friend is going holy paladin)
---
**Warrior Cons:**
---
* Expensive. Repairs, respecs, lack of decent grinding ability. This will be my main on a fresh server and I'm not sure if it would be wise to start with one of the most expensive classes to invest in.
---
* Slow leveling. I *hate* leveling, I am not returning to Classic to relive my leveling days, but to clear content and do things I **didn't** do. So this is a huge con for me. On the other hand, I will be taking about a week off of work when Classic drops so maybe this is the perfect time to start warrior since I will have so much extra free time?
---
* Outside of them being the best tanks in Vanilla, I really have never cared much for the class altogether. But I did some tanking as a DK in WOTLK, and absolutely love tanking. 
---
**Priest pros:**
---
* I have tons of experience healing BC-Cata, and I love it.
---
* Considered *the* iconic healer
---
* Very decent leveling speed with wand specialization and that spirit talent
---
* I do actually like playing priests overall
---
* One of the best 1 v 1 classes in the game, pretty good in pvp overall
---
**Priest cons:**
---
* Mana hungry. Whether you are raids, pvping, or anything you constantly have to have mana efficiency in mind
---
* You are basically not ever going to get anywhere as Shadow DPS. From what I hear, raids should be a MAX of 1 Spriest(and you are still competing with other classes that might get gear priority over you, mage, lock, etc) I do plan on healing primarily, but when I get bored of end game content it would be nice to gear up as DPS *Like I wanted to on warrior)
---
* Not looking forwards to learning hot to downrank. Though with a good healbot-like addon, this shouldnt take too long.
---
* If I want to grind inbetween raids/dungeons the respec costs are going to get quite expensive. 
---
**Warlock Pros:**
---
* Probably the best ranged DPS in the game (mages win early raids, but from what I hear in the long term warlocks come out on top)
---
* Free lock mount at 40. On a fresh server this is CRITICAL I feel. I can invest that gold into other things.
---
* Fast fast fast leveling, probably only hunter is faster.
---
* Once geared, I can do really well in PVP. 
---
* Farming on a lock won't be a problem, and probably won't even require a respec
---
* Summons
---
**Warlock cons:**
---
* I have honestly never even played a lock, though not from lack of interest. But I get the premise of the class just fine.
---
* Gnome (because I'm a min/maxer)
---
* Soul Shards
---
* Is not a tank or healer, so it could be harder to get into raids/get geared (due to competition)
---
I can't Quit Thinking About you &lt;3 ---
---
Pserver has had old mounts until 1.4 just as a status symbol for the early boys, maybe blizzard will get the same idea from that it's pretty cool thing.
---
Having recently tried out one of the instant 60 private servers that has very easy access to naxx stuff I can tell you its not a fun experience trying to fight people who have 1.5k instant cast crits when you only have like 4k health on a good day.
---
I hope people don't take this as vanilla bashing because I wholeheartedly loved vanilla when it was out, but so few people cleared naxx before TBC that it was never a real issue, if they decide to do 1.12 forever I think that eventually anybody not a guild capable of getting naxx gear would just stop pvping all together because of how big the disparity was, then it will just devolve into who has better cooldowns and which group could coordinate their instants on a target better, which doesn't sound like vanilla at all to me.
---
Contact blizzard support, I’ve paid for around 6-7 months in a row without playing and didn’t realise.
---
Blizzard can see that you haven’t played at all during that time and will most likely be able to give you the play time back. I don’t think they will be able to refund anything other than the latest month. 
---
Just my experience, hope this helped. :)
---
I prefer killing dwarves over killing gnomes, but maybe that shouldn't be a t-shirt.
---
Maybe post it here but with a tag [Theorycrafting] or [Min-maxing]? So that the (more casual, like me) people immediately see it's not for them and it doesn't have to be for everyone? And they won't even go to the thread and get triggered.
---
Maybe we could ask mods to add a new flair?
---
Upvote for Tool in a vanilla pvp video
---
Elitistjerks.com
---
I am taking improved drain soul, and that's still not enough mana to play efficiently, you need more, you can't even kill 2 mobs without taking a break unless you're managing mana.
---
&gt; Life tap isn't keeping me topped off... life tap costs health. I was talking about siphon life.
---
Yea, i brain farted when i wrote that comment, i apologize, thought i managed to ninja edit it.
---
But again, it's not just 100 mana, it's 100 mana plus however much you would regen during your fsr.
---
Beat me by 45 min 👍
---
Very true, thanks for sharing your thoughts.  If post Naxx content wasn’t happening, I would choose fresh and/or TBC.
---
It’s classic.  Vanilla is a flavor. 
---
It would be awesome if Reforged would come just before Classic. To re-play the story and immediately continue. 
---
Sadly probably won't happen.
---
I'm a mage who plans to do this. I hate rerolling professions. Do what you want to do my dude. 
---
Did you watch the classic announcement by chance? Lol
---
Is blizzard unprofessional for calling their own game Vanilla? 
---
tanking in WOTLK, i thought that if you chose a talent tree you had to put all your points in it. so i was 0/71/0 frost dk (for tanking). a healer woke me up in TOC, i was tanking since launch
---
Did you order vanilla halo? Or play vanilla runescape? Vanilla guild wars? 
---
Welcome to 1.12 Wow.
---
They are making 1.12 Wow.
---
You can bubble out of literally anything. 
---
I have another one for you...
---
I was playing a dwarf hunter an eternity, with level 41 I found a really nice family guild. 
---
They had like an ambassador/mentor for new ones in the guild. He would support you and help you with questing and leveling. 
---
He started to check my gear and was shocked. 
---
I always put on gear with the highest armor. I didn’t care about agility, strength, intelligence or whatever. The most armor won. 
---
He explained that I had to look out for agility on leather but most preferred mail. 
---
Hahah I was so ashamed ... level 41 and I was the biggest noob!
---
The funny thing is Asmongold does the same thing with his stream. Whenever he talks about wow it's about the same problems he has with the game over and over again, no master loot, titanforging, GCD change ect. We get it buddy we don't need to hear another 30min lecture on how much you hate the GCD change again.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought as well.
---
TL DR nig
---
Yeah I did. When they were relating to the audience and then called it by its professional name.  Classic. Dipshit 
---
I played warrior. 16 years old. Played maybe 35 levels. People started messaging me laughing at my gear. In parties, in open world, and I was like wtf?? Turns out stamina, strength, agility are important and common white items with a little more armor aren't as good. /shrug #menotthatkindoforc
---
100% agree with this. 
---
It'd be weird if they didn't introduce fresh servers at some point, but it's best to never take anything for granted. In that case cycling events would be ideal. I really hope that isn't the case though. 
---
What's weird is that old vanilla podcasts were actually great in their content. It was a bunch of (mostly wrong) prognostications about the game and its direction and what works and what doesn't and it really showed what players back then were thinking about. But it was more dynamic and changed as the game changed.
---
This Classic content is all pretty dull and just goes nowhere. They're all sitting on their hands talking about stuff that most private server players already know or have panned out and most anyone who's uninformed could probably learn from far more concise and informative places.
---
This subreddit is so bizarre. I read the weirdest complaints on here
---
They also used an ice cream analogy and said vanilla. The entire community has been calling it vanilla for 14 years. It honestly baffles me that anyone can find that offensive.
---
What has happened to the kids from this generation? Why are they offended about everything? 
---
I hope it didn't sound like I was taking a positive or negative stand on Asmon. My point is that they want to be super established WoW content creators and they just don't have the goods.
---
Need to add to pvp realms:
---
- Horde will have dedicated gank guilds in Redridge eventually. Enjoy death.
---
- Horde will constantly wander over from STV to Raven Hill and camp it. Enjoy Death.
---
- Horde has a base with FP right in the middle of STV and you don't. Enjoy Death.
---
- If Horde has the biggest player count and can't pop BGs often, they will honor grind lvl 50+ leveling zones to dust. Enjoy death.
---
- Endgame: You have better FP locations so likely can sneak into raids easier. Yay!
---
- You get to raid their cities easier. Yay!
---
I'm almost too embarrassed to admit this.....
---
As a Boomkin, I didn't know/understand what a DOT was. Ran around for waaaaay too long just spamming moonfire.
---
Mine was being level 58 and noticing that my normally purple experience bar was blue. I normally logged out wherever. When I leaned why, I died a little bit inside. I was indeed a hunter. 
---
I feel that. I guess I'm just trying to save you and your friends from wasting your time because it's much more fun to actually down bosses first or second try and progress smoothly through content. Wiping over and over again in dungeons (forever ghost running) and 40 man raids quickly annoys everyone (even casuals) and the better players tend to jump ship when it becomes the norm for the guild which makes it way harder to clear. You don't have to be an elitist to have an appreciation for viable specs and how BiS gear isn't always what you think it might be (e.g. Lots of leather on pre-raid BiS fury warrior). Having fun should always be the first priority but nothing is worse than realizing you can't have the optimal amount of fun because you potentially wasted so much time choosing the wrong character or group comp
---
That boss was such a monster on your first run through if no one in the group knew the minimum lvl for what your tank had to be to not eat crushing blows by him and you got there and just couldn't kill him. Or the dps wouldn't kill the normal dwarves smacking your healer up even after two wipes. Probably a top 3 most rewarding 5 man boss to defeat though.
---
I dunno...I'd worry that bags would probably drop enough and that the cost of mats could make vendor bags more money-efficient for lots of players to  buy instead. 
---
Does the entire community of those games call them by Vanilla? No? Okay, then your point sucks.
---
That's typically what I do, but some zones don't allow for that really, so you just have to grind. Such as Stonetalon Mountains. Following the path is usually devoid of mobs for various lengths of time, or they're like spiders that could be 4 lvls below you. It's not like Darkshore where you can just travel near the road and pull every plainstrider, bear and moonstalker within sight.
---
I did something similar but for a shorter time frame. Support comped me game time equal to the months I payed and did not play. 
---
Once u get some gear and engi you become a 1v1 god with holy/reck...If you can get a good 1hander and shield along with a solid 2hand you ascend to a legend
---
Nano said ppl do pvp just for fun before honor system?! sry, wat?
---
wth? ppl pvp for resources, farm spots and for control of them (aswell cos of faction war and to defend levelers, fps and important points), thats the most organic pvp in rpg instead of some artificial system to carry it through, like bgs and chasing some points in you profile.
---
really strange comment from him. seems like he doesn't get vanilla.
---
Also about flasks, they suppose to be rare and exciting and not your mundane buff for every raider. wtf he was talking about? 
---
Thats how they were in vanilla. I remeber kungen was talking how at C'thun kill in AQ their whole raid popped a flask and it something AWE and omega tryhard. 
---
It isnt suppose to be for everyone BY DESIGN. and suppose to be special and exciting and not mundane, and points of contestion,  thats why back lotus have such a long time spawn and rarity. 
---
Its really ridiculous he doesn't get it. on private servers they made it into a mundane thing, same with world buffs. 
---
"Everyone gets evertyhing. accessibilty, you know, woohoo!!". that type of logic.
---
obviously some proportional adjustement for server pop was needed on this ps's, but on ps they made it so even pugs and small raids raid with full set of world buffs and all flasked. really ridicuolous. no wonder meta is speedrunning..
---
also to all classic cast, stop making such and accent on r14 weapons jesus christ, its for 0.01% of the playerbase that omegatryhard tog et them to use in pve. probably on many servers there won't be even a progress guild that go for such operation.
---
its a product of ometryhard vanilla spergs on ps which is a very limited group of ppl, that literally 0.01% how many ppl get r14 before bwl like literally few ppl. and you discussing it over and over... yea its good to be aware of it too, but it won't make anything for most of the players and even server, where there won't be such turbonerds pve progressive group of entusiasts chasing parses... cos you will clear this raids without r14 weapons anyways. 
---
Yeah its called getting dat ad money
---
Warlocks get riding training for free, so you are still saving 90g if you want to buy a regular mount
---
I like what they have done so far. They're changing some things and trying to re-create the experience rather than give us a snapshot of the game as we had it at the time. With that in mind, I think Blizzard should re-tune certain fights. My ideas:
---
* No new abilities. Only tweak the numbers + add abilities back into the game if they were removed (i.e. Onyxia).
---
* No bugs/unintended mechanics (i.e. C'thun).
---
* Everything before Naxx should be tweaked. My gut says Naxx should not, but I have never cleared it before - I'll let people who have actually cleared Naxx discuss this one.
---
By the way, when it comes to buffs, the top DPS of the retail Vanilla speedrun is missing the following:
---
Spirit of Zandalar: 15% stats
---
Fengus' Ferocity: 200AP
---
Songflower Serenade: 5% crit, 15% stats
---
Battle Squawk: 5% haste
---
R.O.I.D.S.: 25 strength
---
Elixir of Mongoose: 2% crit
---
Juju Power: 30 strength
---
Blessed Sunfruit: 10 strength
---
2x Elemental Sharpening Stone: 4% crit
---
That's 30% stats, 200AP, 11% crit, 65 strength and 5% haste missing on top of playing a suboptimal spec/race combo in a suboptimal way.
---
Oh my god it's so far away
---
I came from playing D2, and + base stats were pretty useless on your gear, you wanted +skills, mods, sockets, immunities and +defense (Armor in D2) among other things.
---
Since none of those stats existed on gear and only gave +base stats, I always defaulted to the items with the highest armor and ignored stats until i was about level 30 when my friends taught me otherwise.
---
I think that's the case on psevers where you have a large influx of players initially and then a very slow trickle of them afterwards. On retail and I'm assuming in Classic, you're going to see a lot of people still joining a server and hitting 60 a while afterwards and they'll need bags. Even if the price of bags drops a moderate amount I feel like the cloth price will drop nearly just as much if not more. I could totally be wrong though. Don't vendor bags cap out at like 12 slot?
---
My first character was a dwarf Hunter named Bananadwarf and I got all the way to wetlands before discovering what quests were
---
Some *really* difficult 5-man dungeons or 5-man content would be fun. And if Paladin has an upper hand in those then you kill two birds with one stone.
---
When my gear got red I would sell it and buy whites from the vendor. I didn't know that you could repair gear
---
I did the same with my mage lol. Made it to 33 or so before realizing I had talent points.
---
1) They have never said that after classic reveal. Only thing they have said is that they are focusing all of the classic teams focus into Classic at the moment.
---
2) Where do you get the 3 year estimate? It would be extremely likely to make the classic team work on TBC servers after classics development is done. So they should easily be done by the time classic servers are done with all of the phases.
---
Is this a suggestion and a challenge ?
---
If you don't take the time to emote between GCDs the GMs ban you for breaking immersion.

How was it a ret paladin if no talents?

bro you gotta listen to that shit when you fight defias pillagers

never stop

At least for rogue, theres a bit of theorycrafting in the rogue section of the discord but sometimes it devolves into shit throwing depending on who is talking.

You have a very similar dilemma to me! I really want to go ele shaman but I have serious hang ups on their mana issues, lock is so very tempting .... that mana tap tho
---
Or get pissed and rage at them and theyll be nice to you haha

people just don't understand how important +hit is for tanks

I did all the Blacksmithing Quests during Leveling. Even like the crap to turn in 280 Mithril Bars for some crappy Recipies.

That's swapping. It recently became a bannable offense in OSRS because it wrecks the economies. It is hard to enforce though.
---
It's not that bad, he's 47? Right? And galgann is 45 maybe, revelosh is 44, ask is 44, but the first few rooms are lower.  I think it's a neat design and like gnomer it assumes you will be back a few times and not finish everything at once.

A party of 44-45s can sneak in the back and be appropriately leveled.

I’m super down for kobolds and catacombs if every boss is literally just an enlarged kobold model and every piece of loot is some variation of a candle.

Seems a lot of us want to play shamans but aren't sure about the downsides. The keybinds are what's holding me back. Do I really want to get home from a long day and jump on a shaman for a raid with all those clicks?  
---
Tough choices. 
---
Didn't know I could cast spells on my druid till about level 20.... Just white hit stuff.  Yeah leveling was a bit slow haha.  I was 12 at the time so I don't feel too bad for myself

To directly answer your question; it's not that bad. If you tank raids, you will receive tank gear. You will generally only be competing with the other tank warriors in the raid that day. ALL warrior tier pieces are tank gear, and tank gear is already well represented in loot tables compared to the number of tanks normally in the raid. 
---
From fresh 60 all the way through raiding, you will get geared up to the current tier of content much faster than DPS warriors. Even if MT has priority in a raid, you will very quickly be picking up the tier pieces he already has. You'll clean up on loot for any pugs or farm runs, and you'll have no trouble finding groups. 
---
Personally, I would just enjoy farming during off hours.
---
they also overvalue hit for fury

Astranaar is in Ashenvale.

Not according to Dave Ramsey though!

Got Xmas money from my grandma and saw that you could pay to get a few lvls so I think I bought like 32-35 for 20 bucks. Logged back in and saw the 2.5 gold I had was gone tried emails the Company complaining about my gold got no response. Oh and then got account banned for botting the next day and actually responded to the GM that I didn’t bot just paid someone to level for me thinking it was legit at 13 yrs old 
---
Shit when i first started playing dungeons there was no need or grred system. People typed /roll to figure out who got it.
---
I, being the major nubtard I was thought it was a free for all, and would rush in on the kill to loot whatever I could first. That's how I learned about ninja looting lol.
---
if it were at least original art. not some map maker website

From a PvE perspective 200-250ms isn't a big problem. It is annoying if you're used to low latency, but once you get used to it it's impact on pve performance is very small, you can still easily clear all of Naxx and do high level speedruns with 250 ms. Popular private servers are all in europe which means 270-350ms for oceanic players and there's still oceanic guilds competing just fine. It's only a big detriment in PvP where there are a lot of situations where latency can be annoying to outright game breaking (try chasing druids around pillars as a melee with 250ms).
---
Is it just a select server that will have classic wow? Or a group of servers?
---
The biggest thing for me playing on private servers was Latency. It's just not worth going to an EU server just to be able to play during peak hours. This is Vanilla wow, there are gonna be nerds who raid at 4 AM on a Wednesday on North American Servers. I dont think youll have any issue finding a guild or server that caters to your play times.
---
There's a difference between being bad, and playing a spec deemed "sub-optimal". If you can't understand that then yeah, you are kind of an elitist asshole.
---
As an Oceanic player that played on US servers before they introduced the local servers, the latency is annoying. We made it work but we also didn't have a choice. There is an obvious delay between the action and result. 
---
As a mage, I had to /cancel my cast bar before it finished so I wouldn't lose half a second every single frostbolt.
---
As a rogue, I gave up PVP. Backstab was completely messed up. I'd have to stand several feet behind an enemy player for it to register. 
---
One of my favorite wow related memories and most definitely my biggest “oh my god, I’m an idiot” moment.

Flash back to 14 year old me, World of Warcraft just came out and my family still had dial up. This is my first real mmo unless you count runescape. After a 3 DAY install and downloading patches I finally start my first character, being the edgy goth kid I was and a undead main in Warcraft 3 of course I made an undead warrior. 
---
The games amazing and I’m spending hours playing and enjoying exploring this world I’ve been engrossed in since Warcraft 2 came out. Then it happens, I die for the first time while jumping off a cliff into the ocean north of Brill and spawn next to an angel, I see that I can talk to her and she can Rez me. Well this sparks an awesome idea.... let’s explore the world and find an Angel far away to speed up my exploration process as I won’t have to fight anyone.
---
Fast forward 3-4 hours. I’m now a dead undead and walking around the inside of Ironforge. I can’t find the spirit healer because guess what? There are none for horde in alliance zones that you haven’t explored yet. There is no “return to graveyard” button, nothing. My only option is to give up my travels and run back to Brill, to which I said “fuck this shit” and logged out, deleted my character, and rolled a Undead Warlock which then went to become my main all the way into AQ40/Naxx Release. 
---
Great times, things like this you simply can never experience again, true noob status. 
---
Keep in mind that all of us in Australia played on the ping you'll experience for years, and we did fine. There'll be an adjustment period, but it's honestly not that bad. Lmk if you're looking for a guild! 
---
Yup this is pretty much the answer, though i disagree with your take on 20 mans. In my experience, most competent guilds bang out the 20 mans/onyxia before or after their typical 40 man officially scheduled.
---
Ive never seen any guild of note pretend to be too good to run ZG, especially given how fast it can be done. Cant rly on pugs to gear people for shit.
---
I've been struggling to pick a healer in general. I want to play a healer, that has a good offspec for DPSing World PvP / Casual BGs. I would also like a solid role in premades.
---
Druid is the one I'm most on the fence about, they seem really fun to play in World PvP, and have a solid role in premades, on top of being the least played healer and really quick to gear they seem like the 
---
best option. I am just worried that I am going to despise FCing in WSG or base sitting in AB.
---
Shaman seems like the next best choice, with the 30/0/21 spec being able to both heal raids and serve as a hybrid healer/purgebot/big burst tool in premades. Big problem is that my friends want to go Alliance, so I think they are just flat out off the table. I am also worried about how they would be in World PvP.
---
Priest seems ok, to my knowledge shadow is bad in BGs while being godly in World PvP so I would be stuck healing in premades which I don't particularly want to do, but might be willing to change that.
---
Paladin is just off the table. They seem to be strictly healers in PvP other than playing a gimmicky ret spec. 
---
Any ideas? Feel free to tell me where my knowledge is flawed.
---
Being about level 35 and figuring out the hard way that you didn't have to actually equip a helm to see what it looked like on your character... I ruined a pimp rogue helm for my husband.  Suddenly 'untradeable' when he asked for it. LOL. I was leveling a paladin lol.
---
Learning about the Dressing Room feature, FTW :)
---
I would do all of sept. Just to be safe.
---
Logic:
---
The amount of hours you play at launch are not as important as the hours you play within the first 6 months.
---
The ONLY way you get screwed is if you take vacation BEFORE launch.
---
I though /s was the only way! XP
---
Yes, this lol
---
&gt; Gonna need something for another couple dozen hours afterward.
---
ST: DS9
---
I was a complete retard first go around and went 1h dagger and shield up resto to NS then up enhancement.
---
I watched a lot of shaman beta PvP videos in 2004 and everyone rocked the wind fury dagger and shield combo.
---
What you have to remember about that is initially windfury did not have an internal CD and could just proc constantly including off itself, making 1h dagger and shield quite a nightmare for casters and pretty efficient 1-60. 
---
Things have changed.

I've never heard of him! Why does he say to not use credit cards?

LFG for alliance pvp or pve (don't care which as long as it's a good fit but slightly prefer pve) semi hardcore raiding guild. I'm in MST time zone (Colorado) but a night owl so any raid times between 8pm - 2am would work for me. I'm mid thirties and would prefer a group 25+ 
---
Started playing in WOTLk and was in a semi hardcore raiding guild. We cleared all the raids in 10 player and we were working on heroic citadel when the guild started to fall apart. By the time Cataclysm raiding started most of us had gone separate ways and I quite not long after that. 
---
My main was a warlock popojijo on winterhoof but I also was a warrior tank/dps and tanked and downed all of citadel, and some ulduar/naxx name is sahpopojijo (was something different then but had to rename it when I reactivated my account and don't remember the name I used back then for him).
---
I have been messing around on retail and a private server getting ready.
---
I am looking to play a warrior tank if I can find a good group to level with (healer and a mage would be ideal but really just a few people that want to go hard) I like to read quests (if I don't remember them) and love dungeons. I don't mind redoing quests to help group members who weren't able to play and need to catch up. When classic drops I'll be going hard (there is a week and a half in July -August depending on when the monsoons hit SE AZ that I will be completely unavailable)
---
If I can't find that I'll probably go Warlock again as I don't want the frustration of dying a 100 times as playing as a solo warrior is prone to do.
---
Raid wise I'd prefer two nights a week. With a group that has at least two main tanks that switch up and not just a main and some off tanks so that there isn't dependence on just one that causes the guild to fall apart when the main stops being reliable or changes guilds.
---
Sorry this is so long it sort of got away from me.
---
Also applicable to how I've been playing in Apex Legends 
---
As someone who twinks a lot at 19 i am 99% sure we couldn't do ab until around cata I think.  
---
&gt; If it's close enough, sure, but I'll likely have a "trash grays" addon to make room for the good stuff.
---
LootFilter is my jam, man. Since I haven't played retail since Wrath, I have no idea if it's still updated.
---
After level 10, if an item's full stack isn't worth 1.8*my lvl, and it's grey, delete. Trash whites get added to the blacklist.

Playing a druid, I forgot about cat and bear form and ended up grinding my way to 40 using moon fire and meleing mobs. I spent a ton of gold for a blue 2h mace to up my Mele damage.... 
---
You have been filling up my Save folder for quite some time, thanks for the work. I always gravitated towards questing more and this is giving me a new angle to look from. Any plans on publishing your route? Would be interested to see which grinding spots did you chose.
---
This subreddit has gone to shit so quickly... I was really having a good time here but a few months ago noticed lots of increased misinformation, vitriol (particularly around pservers) and general low effort content. 
---
Rolled need on an armor trinket from ST, (a black looking stone thing) because I had no trinket for my second slot.  
---
I was a mage.
---
&gt; I like it hardcore
---
And 
---
&gt;I do it with 40 people
---
Bruh lmao.
---
This is one of the better thought out and workable ideas. Thanks for sharing!

Jesus Christ I had that turned up loud and then suddenly a dragon is screaming in French.
