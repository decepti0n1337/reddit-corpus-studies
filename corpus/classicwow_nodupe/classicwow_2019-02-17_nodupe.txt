Can't really vote with your wallet when blizzard doesn't release games.

I tended to avoid guild drama when and where possible. Left a few guilds because of the drama. I would accept a less “successful” guild if it meant less drama. 
---
Then let's hope they buff MC/BWL to compensate for 1.12 items.
---
Didn't we already pay to play alpha during blizzcon?
---
Thats my tinfoil hat theory but I think Blizzard knows how fragile the hype for classic is and that some people put hours and hours in the demo that had literally no content which tells us that they are also willing to get every single bit of information out of a alpha/beta that they can. There will be hundreds of streamers and thousands of youtube videos about it. To the point where people wont even get hyped about it when the game launches. I think if there is a Beta is will be really short.
---
The first "raid" guild i joined (10/15 mans) only had 3 active warriors, so we had a very hard time getting groups going, 1 prot and 2 arms warriors. 
---

---
One weekend our 1 prot warrior was leading the groups through some dungeons but the officers wanted to lead, which lead to an argument with him. Our GM wasnt there that day. Some piece of grar dropped that the MT needed and the officers gave it to someone else out of spite. Our MT gquit and so did one of our other warriors in protest. The only remaining warrior actually sucked at the game. The guild fell apart the next day because we literally had no tanks.
---
Now the real funny part was the day after when the GM got drunk and announced the disband. He went on about this long winded rant of his kids birtday party was why he wasnt there and couldnt just apologize because the officers were his RL friends and then COMPLETELY devolved into a rant a out his ex-wives, alimony and child support. It was one of the funniest things id ever heard.
---
Famous quotes such as "Dont complain at me for playing games after work, all you do is watch that TV all day, do some fucking dishes!" "I pay over half my pay checks to these bitches and i only have to pay for one of the kids" "Once they get that baby, theyve GOT you." "Im at the point of my life where ive got a steady job and a hard drive full of porn, i dont need another woman in my life."
---
Absolutely unforgettable.
---
basically the community will rip apart every single bit of information they will get about classic if there would be a alpha you would know every fucking single bit about it 2 days later since it would be data mined to the last bits of information that there is. The hype would die out a little because of oversaturation. Blizzard has to be really carefull with what they release especially playable content.
---
You're thinking too much. Just do!
---
Guild Master and Main Tank was chatting in vent, was asked if whether he'd rather spend a night on wow with the guild or a night with his wife. He stated outright online with the guild. Many laughs were had. Until he Nd his wife logged off wow and vent. She was in channel and he'd forgot. That was the end of him playing and the guild. 
---
Until 23 or them give up at lvl 45. 
---
Damn I loved Warhammer.
---
It's part and parcel of playing MMOs with women.
---
Fortnight is dead. Check out apex. 
---
Thanks for sharing, I'll take a look
---
Wow you're some kind of retarded.
---
Believe me, I know.
---
Whoops yes that one!
---
You don't understand.  I'm looking to compare pieces of gear.  Which is better?  a piece of gear that gives 20 SP? 1 hit? a crit and 5 SP?  15 SP and 20 int?  it's not obvious which of those 4 pieces is the best without knowing your stat WEIGHTS, and not just priorities.
---
They hold aggro, don't die, deal good damage.

Hello everyone, today we journey into Maraudon, the birthplace of the centaur. I hope you guys enjoy as I put a lot of work into this one, and it was quite a fun and lengthy dungeon. Planning a giveaway soon as I just hit one of my goals, so stick around for that! Hope you guys enjoy and thanks for the support! :D

money was a mistake

[removed]
---
Sorry that I interrupted your circlejerk. But facts don't care about your feelings
---
Point of this build is to get to Intimidation and Scatter. Also the strongest pet damage incrasing ability before that is Unleashed Fury which I have 5/5 of here. The crit chance and Frenzy is only worth it if you go deeper into the tree. Endurance itself scales nicely with Thick Hide as well.
---
You have to understand talents in their context.

Facts? Yea dude you really are retarded, but don't feel bad. It's been entertaining for me. Seriously though you should probably do some more research into Activision/Blizzard because you clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
Ok, you broke that down *basically* - what's the complex version?
---
after? it would be a success if they didn't do it before release. They will get greedy tho I can promise you that.
---
Yes true, because consistent raiders made up a pretty small percentage of the playerbase. I think I was 10 or 11 when wow launched, I made it to 60, but never got to raid because of time and lack of knowledge. Maybe a couple ZG wipe groups, but that was it. I didn't actually get to a point of viably raiding until wotlk, which was alot easier and had more casual raiding options, and it's probably a similar answer for most of the adolescent players of vanilla.
---
there were a study on /r/music or something like that which said that the current generation thinks 90s music was better. 
---
And I also dont know anyone who thinks that old music or movies are worse than current movies. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Zelda Ocarina of Time, Beatles. These things are seen as masterpieces by younger audiences. 
---
I am 29 years old and think there is a lot of truth to the nostalgia argument when it comes to classic. A lot of the stuff is objectively worse in classic compared to retail. Like class balance, class complexity, encounter mechanics. These are things that some people value a lot. what made classic so good was the experience. It was the first time that the world had an accessible huge online game that wasnt an arena shooter or other round-based games like RTS. 
---
There is a german blogger, Barlow. He is without a doubt the most popular german wow figure. He was famous for his class blogs which he made in vanilla. I am pretty sure that most german players have heard of him. He also agrees on that and thinks that vanilla had some serious issues which are fixed now. And he will only play classic because his fans will probably demand it from him  
---
Not a bad thought. But I would rather just have it removed completely. 
---
For now it looks like classic wow isn't on their radar as a "money maker". That might change depending on how successful classic is.
---
&gt;The zone forced me to play more zoomed in...
---
Which just adds further to the immersion
---
I played on Nath from Vanilla all the way through Legion (I’m just chilling for now while I wait for Classic).
---
I don’t remember your name (I was Horde), and I played an ironically named Troll Hunter called Holyfire. Maybe you remember Nailo? He reached high PvP ranks on Alliance before rerolling Horde and becoming HWL. I invited him to the guild I was in at the time, and he bet me 60g he would beat me to level 60 (I was ~level 45, he was level 20s). 
---
He won.
---
Glad to see an old Nathy, though. I really hope the server names will remain or at least be compiled in a list so that the old timers can find each other again.
---
I also remember many world PvP battles with a mage named Doorknob (I think he was in [The Core]).
---
I absolutely guarantee that parents did not even come remotely close to outnumbering kids in vanilla 
---
I'm just excited for there being social consequences for your actions. I remember back in vanilla my server had a 3rd party site set up with all known ninja looters. Will be nice seeing people actually care about their reputations.
---
Greed happened 
---
Yeah I know Lupos is a myth, one can dream though
---
i dont know why you are this toxic.

Activision is a developer. They make call of duty. 
---
Blizzard has several developing teams, which make wow, overwatch, etc. 
---
Activision-Blizzard is the umbrella, the head, of these two studios. 
---
The guys who develop call of duty have absolutely nothing to say about hots esports staff.

2004 to 2007 bubble king right here.
---
Your reply is literally "NO U" and fails to address even a single point.
---
If an enhancement shaman gets in melee range of you as a mage you did something wrong. They're about as dangerous to mages as warriors are.
---
Not exactly, but the first iteration of the guild was close. People were invited just for being nice and running a 5-man with someone. It got too big, too fast and it never had a declared purpose. But when BC came out, everyone wanted to raid and be accommodated.
---
Not putting it in also requires time changing things. This is current client with backported data and textures. The thing to do to save money is loot trading not only to cut down on GM staff but also cause they don’t have change anything in their coding.
---
Classic is going to be using the new engine, so you'll want to start with the more modern guides.
---
What backwards ask place did you grow up in where 'raping a drunk dude' is drama, and not a serious crime?
---
I mean just have one healing pally use RF and be the Judgement of Light dude and he should keep aggro reasonably easily on the ranged guy.
---
Then the entire world is bubble hearth pallys
---
It's still not worth it, that strat generally relies on buffing disc priests' damage with the ret pallies/judgements.
---
**ASMONGOLD **REACTS** TO NEW #CLASSIC NEWS**
---
I don't remember too many horde names. Juggernautx, Lanfear, Cheeseball, Icutyou are all I remember very well. Nailo sounds familiar, but I don't think I interacted with him much. I remember Lanfear having the first epic mount I ever saw. I remember her ganking me in STV for a while, and me getting to 60, getting gear and killing her in Wpvp/bgs. It was a great feeling - like killing a raid boss, haha.  The community was such a wonderful thing. I played with Daerlan, Odinmage, Albiorix, Kristi, Thedivh a lot. 
---
I'm not really trying to get realm first, however I do wanna clear raids.
---
I've never really had a character where I reap much benefit from a profession.
---
I mean like a couple class rerolls and server jumps, and in vanilla I never got any professions.
---
So I think having a crafting profession in itself is gonna be really fun for me.
---
I guess I will take tailoring because there's more than just raiding I'm looking forward to (hopefully if they don't muck it up, I'm constantly thinking twice because of loot trading and what not), like AV matches that last at least an hour.
---
But yeah forgot about what I'm really looking for in the game, till you reminded me, thanks!
---
Not more iconic, but more broken was the Shadowmeld + Aimed Shot. It used to be the entire aimed shot cast time would finish before shadowmeld was broken.
---
A 41 yd ranged-"ambush" with an aimed shot, auto, and multi shot all landing at the same time. (3-4k if it all crits on cloth/leather-wearers) So broken lol.
---
Oh it is. Police were involved. It's just nuclear drama.
---
I have 0 Rogues so far in a guild of 25. Go Figure with the polls. :(
---
I’ll never forget the quest in hillsbrad as a horde one of the first you get in tarren mill you had to collect spider Ichor I believe and you either got it immediately or were farming it for EVER. 
---
I don't think they'll do that lol
---
This is why I'm pretty upset they haven't released more information.
---
Like by now they should've figured this stuff out, right? Why not do a post or announcement that details some thought processes on their choices.
---
I had a bit of a war with the rogues &amp; company that would gank in redridge. I had to set my hearth in redridge because sometimes they would catch me slipping and I'd fall into a trap, so I'd have to bubble hearth but didn't wanna leave. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Good times.
---
Its similar to a warrior rolling on a bow the hunter wants. The melee weapon is the warriors main weap... the ranged weapon is the hunter's.
---
Awesome content! Keep it going! &lt;3
---
In between Alterac Vale and Iron Bluff.

Best level for Priest/ warrior duo in world pvp is 60 
---
jesus christ..
---
Came here for your comment
---
Yes, 21/0/30 is one of the most popular Paladin builds.
---
You can get all of the useful DPS stuff in Ret (skipping the 31 point Repentance which is pretty poor for anything bar PvP sadly), and get 5/5 illumination and Divine Focus which will let you heal in raids almost as well as a pure Holydin.
---
If you're more into PvPing then you might prefer 20/0/31 but both can work. Don't worry about the 3% hit in Prot tree, it takes 8 points to get and isnt worth sacrificing for when you can get the 2h hitcap so easily with gear.
---
good thing nelfs couldn't be mages.
---
PoM pyro.
---
I honestly never understood why people bubble hearthed like yeah I didn't get to kill you but now you have to fly all the way back here to do your quests. The person who hearths still loses, and far more than if they just walked from the gy. 
---
Okay, so for raiding and pvp your idea of 'context' is to spend 8 talent points on your pets hp and armor, and another 2 on revive speed, while ignoring the damage increasing talents. I mean I get that you have to basically throw away 5 talent points in that tree to get to intimidate, but you're throwing away 10. Also spending 22 points in BM instead of 21, so one of those talent points is even more of a waste. I wouldn't go with your first tier talent choices in survival either, even if you don't like parry chance (which is silly if this is supposed to be a hybrid pvp build), putting 6 points into those tier 1 talents is also a waste. It just seems like a very lazy and not thought out talent build someone came up with on the back of their already made leveling build.

How to go about calculating stat weights: wrote your own sim program.
---
Unfortunately this is very dynamic with gear and there isn't an approximation that isn't just a priority list. If I was at my desktop I could probably help some more... 
---
Something like DMG = (base + (spell damage * modifier) )*crit chance * crit modifier * haste * hit chance 
---
Would also need to know how much of each stat is required for % crit hit and haste.
---
gouge backstab

Their hearth may have been local rather than in a major city. See a comment above about hearthing to the same zone.

trolls + health regeneration, literally unstoppable

The worst part about rolling as a frost mage: No PoM pyro
---
The best part: everything else
---
What
---
Oh yeah! You could go deep fire and get pyro's off (no POM needed.)
---
Or lock's instead of needing succubus seduce could get a soul fire off while saccing their imp.
---
This is an awesome series idea. I'd love to see more.
---
Pretty safe bet that we will get naxx. Dual spec is very unlikely based off what they said at blizzcon.
---
https://i.imgur.com/XAFIfsJ.jpg
---
Naxx will eventually be available. At launch, only the first few raids that were available in early Vanilla will be unlocked, and over time, later raids and other endgame content will be unlocked.
---
This makes me sad. Fire mages are OP in pvp but frost was the best for raiding.
---
rofl
---
Its crazy because pallys actually did this to me back in the day unironically 
---
It's not so bad for mages they can farm 50g in an hour with zero effort
---
Interesting you say that, because in the original beta, mages had invisibility and could do exactly what draco is describing, except with Pyroblast.  
---
I may go warlock this time around so I don't have to respect all the time.
---
&gt; Okay, so for raiding and pvp
---
I specifically said this isn't a raiding build.
---
&gt; ignoring the damage increasing talents
---
The strongest damage increasing talent per point is "Unleashed Fury" which this build has 5/5 of. PvE content means solo farming and dungeons, in both cases your pet will be or can be tanking. The only other pet DPS talent you can get with this build (instead of the survivability talents) is Ferocity which I'am not a fan of if you don't get Frenzy as well. 15% crit for your pet looks nice but is about a 2% damage increase overall at most for you vs 15% pet health.
---
You can finetune this build ofc to be more PvP centric. But even then I wouldn't recommend you getting Ferocity (w/o Frenzy) because you're just going to trigger the crap out of freecasting talents all the time while getting a relatively small damage increase from it. As for the survival talents you can move some into Parry ofc to increase your PvP survivability.
---
Alliance and uncontested world bosses.
---
Mage is fairly vulnerable to ganks in the 30s, around STV and arathi etc. They have to eat and drink a lot and have poor hp, they make tasty targets for rogues/hunters. In the 40s/50s though they become very powerful with access to all their skills like evocation/ice block/ice barrer/mana gem and gain a lot of damage and efficiency, and go right to the top of pvp levelling classes. A rogue can pretty much forget about ganking a frost mage that ice barriers everytime before they drink. 
---
  
---
Basically everyone except druid/lock/hunter can easily be sheep'd and then you just mount and ride away or evocate/bandage/eat/drink to full and open on them from 36 yards with frostbolts. Hunter is pretty easy to beat as long as you have mana - the only real trouble is a warlock, particularly a SL one that sees you coming and already has fel puppy out - you can practically forget about it, but that is a pretty rare and slow levelling spec. Most warlocks are afflic and won't have a felhunter and they're not too bad, especially if you have your pvp trinket.
---
I have this as a plate, and it was around the same time it was taken away. 
---
He said for non raid 
---
Preach brother. Letting a lack of updates weaken our resolve and have us start second guessing ourselves is exactly what the finance department us hoping for lol.
---
No.Changes.
---
I didn’t get to experience any juicy raid guild drama in vanilla sadly, I mostly ran my own tiny guild of like 20 other noobs and only a few of us even got to 60 lol. There was always drama on the global /RP channel though, RP servers are goldmines for nasty cybernerd breakups and e-peen fights. 
---
When did they take away pom pyro? 
---
Or, it's part and parcel of playing MMOs with men. In my experience, the women just turn up and play, it's the dudes who start behaving like potatoes because of it.
---
Kek world pvp was the best it's been in tbc.. And was more natural interaction points between fractions, sunwell dailys where some my greatest pvp moments!, the rpg cross world dungeon lvling statement is retarded... Your in a area for 58-70 with a fraction of the land mass or zones so expected but having the number of varied contrasting and interesting zones, zones only accessible with flying ext made that 12 lvls arguably the most "rpg" 12lvl period 1-70..., I couldn't make it any further into your rant lol 
---
What would you recommend at 60 for holy/prot hybird? I'd like to maximize my ability to tank and hold threat in 5 mans effectively.
---
My plan is to go [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVutIez0o) spec.
---
From my understanding you don't need much past 5/5 [Illumination](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20215) to be a solid healer. My goal is to be able to flex as a healer/tank for 5 mans until I complete my pre-raid BiS sets. After that I plan on going deep holy.
---
Hard to die!
---
You'll wait...but only for 10 seconds.
---
Dude what is with you and posting these awful Eric Andre memes over and over again...
---
A significant DKP penalty for that dude, surely.
---
Still blows your hour CD and the run couldn’t be any closer than just dying. 
---
It’s virtually never optimal to bubble hearth. 
---
I agree with OP if you force a bubble hearth that’s a huge win
---
But unlike melee that use ranged weapons exclusively for the stats, a Hunter has multiple melee abilities that can hit like a truck with the right twohander for when somebody is within their deadzone.
---
To say the two things are similar is simply not true. Both warriors and hunters depend upon good melee weapons for PvP, and since neither gains a PvE benefit from the twohander it just makes no sense to give one priority over the other.
---
/say Screw you guys I’m going home

Yeah you have to draw the line somewhere, but being able to right click/report someone and ban them without any 3rd party involvement is no bueno!

Keep the faith and keep doing what you're doin.  Like any community there needs to be consistent involvement from those that are into it otherwise it loses some of its quality.

&gt;&gt; Anything that isn't vanilla is trash.

You literally called it trash in the same sentence as saying nobody calls it trash lol

I cant shoot someone with my bow in pvp?
---
Was the bubble long enough for Redridge level pally to hearth? 
---
Ifrc, the lower rank pally bubbles were less than the hearth cast - correct me if I’m wrong
---
In vanilla aimed shot takes you out of shadowmeld but can still get a multishot off before enemy knows what's up
---
I dont believe they increased in time. I remeber bubble hearing just for the lols when I got it
---
[https://i.imgur.com/m9SgSyo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/m9SgSyo.jpg)
---
Fixed it
---
Yes sir
---
Dying costs money. Going back into town was probably more beneficial anyways, repair, vendor, maybe a trainer too depending, turn in a few quests. Fuck it maybe take a a hit break and get rested.
---
If it's set to a capital city then you got AH and def trainers and secondary trainers etc
---
It happened many times, being ganked and hitting the “oh shit!” button to get to safety! Worked (nearly) every time!
---
If you are being camped and know you can’t get any help, you have 2 options: 
---
1) keep dying and running from the gy to your body and hope that your enemy got bored of you and moved on (and if not, hope you can manage to escape)
---
Or
---
2) log off and go on a different character
---
If you go with option 2, then hearthing will at least give you rested xp and at most gives you a chance to stock up on supplies before you head out questing again - bubble hearth seems like a great choice in this case.
---
I always rolled frost, except for a brief period after flying mounts were introduced when you could dismount midair, PoM pyro an unsuspecting mounted warrior, and laugh all the way to the ground as you watched them plummet. 
---
Holy cow if I can only find a decent Guild w/o drama for classic.
---
Guild drama usually stems from one of two things:
---
A) Someone either is underperforming regularly or at least being accused of it. This has something to do with maturity. It's "this guy sucks" instead of "how can we help this guy to do better" from the accuser(s) and "don't tell me how to play" instead of "maybe I can do more in this regard" from the accused. This is usually super awkward, but doesn't escalate too often.
---
B) Loot drama. The worst of worst. Loot drama is not a Guild specific problem but also for Dungeons/PUGs. I hate this the most. People are so friggin mad about Loot all the time, even self-proclaimed PMA people. This kind of drama can be *easily* avoided if everyone follows the two golden rules: 1. Need *everything* that legitimately improves your character and 2. Don't be a bitch if you don't get something you need.
---
Actually, most of vanilla aimed shot didn't break shadowmeld. It was changed in 1.10. NE hunters could mount, rez, or aimed shot while shadowmelded. It was glorious.
---
I disagree. I met couples in raid guilds who didn't talk much at all. They were just like everyone else. It's the attention seeking people who you need to look out for, regardless of gender/relationship.
---
Yeah sounds sweet I just mean in the version we all play I wish it was still that way would be busted
---
That brief period in 2010 where they let him do Interviews was a wild one. Glad to see they realised he wasn't one you could put in the spotlight.
---
Respec is a thing u know
---
I have a Reck paladin on pserver that Iplay a lot, I used to try and abuse /sit with a macro but I've moved away from it over time unless I'm fighting a really cheesy rogue. 
---
You still can easily generate reck stacks if you are playing in a healing role.  Hunters, rogues, and casters can really do a lot.  Especially mages- frost nova can crit, arcane explosion, etc.  Before you know it you can easily have a couple and not even have taken a lot of damage. 
---
Yeah this is the right answer. 
---
yeah.. lots of people geared up their characters in vanilla for the purpose of killing the enemy faction.. not harder raid bosses
---
In all my years of playing Paladin I have never actually bubblehearthed.
---
I've memed about it because spicy memes, but never actually done it.
---
Depends on what you mean by "ret stuff".  PVP is probably better to go into Prot to get reckoning, improved hammer and conc aura, and kings.  Ret spec really gives you seal of command, faster move speed, better melee crit and vengeance.  It's a toss up which is more useful. 
---
26/25/0 or 21/0/30 are both very capable heal specs with significant PVP boosts.  Could also do 25/26/0 and pick up blessing of Sanc as well to be an extra tank buff or do some dungeon tanking on your own (if you have enough gear!)
---
The Fury Tank
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVV0VxxoVoxfzoxM
---
That's right, dual-wielding, hard-hitting bad ass tanking. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVVuhxxoVoxfzox
---
There is also this variation that I'm personally really interested in. It requires you to have a fury war in your party with 5/5 improved battle shout, and he needs to be on the ball with refreshing it in range of you.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/AddOn_programming_tutorial
---
Never
---
You're right, low level bubbles don't last long enough to get a hearth off in vanilla. 
---
You should always respect, especially your sensei
---
No Ice Lance either :-(
---
Hinterlands one is by far the worst. It's like across the entire zone and that zone has one of the longest corpse runs as well. Completing it on a busy pvp server is a mission.
---
I've seen a lot of new creators post a thread with a discussion in it, and then say "the tl;dr version is on my YouTube page" or something like that with a link. Ive always found that great as it actively promotes discussion while also generating views.
---
I did!  Was a healer in the All For One guild.  We raided aq and nax as well. Nath was a good server.
---
tauren and undead is a pretty neat combo, most sham warriors are some type of orc.
---
The bubble at level 20 would have been Divine Protection, which lasted only 8 seconds, while the Hearthstone has a 10 second cast time.
---
This is your Prot build at level 60
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxzhbZcZxfzoeMdVo
---
Divine Shield's duration is 10/12 seconds depending on rank, but isn't learned until level 40.
---
If you were level appropriate for Redridge then you would have had Divine Protection rank 2, which lasts for 8 seconds. If you were Bubble Hearthing in Redridge you were either level 40+ or somebody neglected to hit you for a 2 second window at the end of the Hearthstone cast.
---
Oh yeah, besides the odd custom, "fun" server I pretty much exclusively play vanilla.
---
Limited Invulnerability and Tidal Charm?
---
Enough dots have been thrown around these here parts, partner.
---
Correct,
---
The only time in classic a reck proc will happen is if the other other player legitimately crit you. Not just by sitting. Same applies to warrior on crit talent abilities.
---
In vanilla, sitting didn't just crit, it allowed the opportunity of a "double crit", where if the melee yellow attack would have crit, it stacks with the sit damage crit. Definitely not something you want to be trying to rely on outside of a MangOS core private server.
---
Also don't overvalue defence, and don't underestimate agility. 
---
There are 3 sets of gear you're going to want, to be a prepared badass vanilla tank. 
---
TPS set (threat-per-second)
---
Max-Mitigation set 
---
Aoe set

Your aoe rotation, that I've seen a lot of warriors make the mistake of is; Bloodrage&gt; Battleshout &gt; Demo-shout &gt; Cleave. Depending on the fight and how much rage you have to work with, you'll use a macro that will use both your demo/cleave together.
---
Your shouts will slap enough threat on the mobs that your healers wont pull threat. The key to this is to make sure your party is in range of the shouts. You gain extra threat for every party member that receives battle shout. Your gut instinct will be to use thunderclap. It's nice to slap on hard hitting mobs, but it doesn't generate the threat you need compared to your shouts.
---
Now you start to mix in your aoe pieces like these:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18326
---
Razor Guantlets.
---
These items will do dps for you and help get that initial threat and hold it while you start to cycle through to slap sunders on them.
---
Vanilla tanking is 5% fights, 95% preparation. 
---
I see all these pallys saying they have never bubble hearthed. That shit is the ultimate get out of jail free card. Did you get ganked? Yes? Can you win? No? Is bubble off CD? Yes? Bye bitch.
---
They use an addon to list each piece individually. They don't do it manually. And the reason why they do it is to increase the sales value of the commodity that they are selling. By listing individual pieces at a slight markup they can sell their items to people who are looking to save money by buying a smaller quantity of goods.
---
Basically, they increase profit margins by selling to people who need a smaller quantity but who are willing to pay more for each individual item because they still save money by not buying in bulk.  
---
This is the same reason why a grocery store can buy a pallet full of cheese from the manufacturer and resell it at a profit. This is basic economics.
---
But what if they bubble hearth your pom pyro..
---
The difference between leveling mining and herbalism is that you need to adjust your leveling route as a miner so that you're close to the edge of the zone/caves. As an herbalist you can for the most part just follow the quests/grind whatever mobs you like and you'll eventually stumble across herb nodes that you need.
---
Thank you guys so much for the responses!
---
Frost was the best for raiding in MC and BWL specifically. For everything else, Fire does more damage.
---
Cross realm bgs was in Vanilla.
---
Dont forget the clickbaity title "HUGE NEVER BEFORE SEEN CLASSIC INFO YOU CANNOT MISS"
---
Worst Quest: [Deep Ocean, Vast Sea](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=982)
---
Now this, this is a lie. If you said I did it rarely I’d believe it because some Alliance dogs have even teeny specks of honour...
---
I got caught in a raid and they perma cc-ed me. Wouldn't kill me, mc-heal or Polly to keep me alive. I dced and they were still there 5 min later. Trinket vanish they would aoe. It was hell. Had to log off for an hour. 
---
Bubble+hs would have been a win for me.
---
Atleast you can finish that one with some grinding, try out https://classicdb.ch/?quest=982 , have fun with swarms of murlocs, underwater, at level 16. The amount of time it will take you to kill a few, resurface for air, the first ones you killed will begin to respawn.
---
Why would you give up AT 45? That’s when the game really starts to take off
---
Divine intervention and a Druid with rebirth as your entire raid wipes to blood princes for the 7th time
---
I don’t agree with this.   
---
I think it’s simply that Reddit is full of maladjusted people who deal with depression or a general dissatisfaction with their life and have an inherent negative, sometimes nihilistic, often times apathetic view on most things.
---
Running the company into the ground is how people like Kotic make their living. To them companies are resources meant to be mined and liquidated,  not nurtured and grown.
---
As a hunter/mage/warlock you can cheese the fight with Araj by climbing to the second floor of the partially burned house near him and range him down, the adds he spawns wont be able to path up to you.
---
We went into Maraudon... You won’t believe what we found
---
Nah I'd change it up for raiding. You'd want to be frost anyway in the early tiers, and Impact has no use in raids. You're better off getting Elemental Mastery. I skip it for the leveling tree because it's kind of unimpressive at low crit rates, and I would have to give up important PvP talents to get it. I want to do some PvP while leveling, because doing just quests and dungeons can get a bit boring after some time.
---
Yeah I'm definitely going to be mostly PvP'ing at 60, so I'll stick to the elemental build. I think 21/30/00 could be fun too, since that's the build I used to play the most. Elemental is definitely better, though.
---
You'll want something like a 2/31/18 or 0/33/18 or 0/31/20 (always getting trueshot aura and surefooted for pve) but with emphasis on picking up stuff like deterrance in the survival tree. Deterrance is a great panic button vs warrs and rogues that'll often give you time to turn a fight around in group pvp.
---
dispel or heal
---
Nobody calls retail a trash game, it's a fantastic cosplay dressup collector and corridor simulator, but it's a trash MMORPG. You can see there's a difference right? Try to work on your reading comprehension.
---
Yes... At 50g a pop.
---
My favourite was ice block &gt; cold snap &gt; ice block. Mage was the ultimate staller in Arathi Basin.
---
And there's nothing you can do about it.
---
In that case, lmao I fucking agree. That’s certainly an anomaly tho
---
Enhance has nothing to close the gap, you can match the Frost Shock with Cone and keep him at 15yrd range permanently, there is nothing he can do, if he Trinkets the slow you can Nova for free, as he has no CC that you need to worry about you can Blink away outside of his Shock range while he's still slowed for easy casts, remember you can R1 Frostbolt his Grounding and then cast CS instantly before he can even get a Heal off, there is nothing Enhance Shaman can do without FAP and Engineering against a Mage.
---
You can use Frost Ward before he gets into Shock range to either absorb the Shock damage or force him to spam Purge to get it, which gives you tempo advantage to either space away, bait out a Grounding with a Polymorph or just use instant casts for early damage.
---
Enhance Shaman is only good for leveling up, sadly it has no real place in 60 PvP (Ele) or PvE (Resto).
---
Skinning always as you should be AoE farming for leveling and gold in places like Maraudon
---
Well alright then
---
If I didn't do it while being completely helpless against a Hunter in the Shimmering Flats don't know why I would do it to anyone else.
---
Plus my hearth's almost always set to SW/IF and the run from there back to where I'm questing at is a lot worse than just running back to my corpse.
---
This is r/classicwow and as a vanilla player, i don’t know what that supposed “Ice Lance” is /s
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spell=1020 and https://classicdb.ch/?item=10645
---
I was level 60 fighting the level 60 rogues ganking lowbies 
---
lol this reminds me of every interaction I've ever had with a product owner
---
Winner
---
I've had the same thing happen. I've played around 100 hours total of retail wow throughout its existence. I've spent thousands of hours on Vanilla private servers because of rose colored glasses, apparently. 
---
A mage can farm 50g in an hour
---
Frost mages are the Honda civic of specs. Nothing is cool about them but they're reliable.
---
Remember the horror of losing your divine shield before you hearthed.
---
&lt;---Udead/Udiedagain    Shaman on horde PVP side!
---
&gt; I'm scratching my head here because I see no logical connection at all between those two ideas. Corporations should behave morally whether or not they are legally "people".
---
You can't say that companies shouldn't be considered people, and then try and force human morality onto a concept. Corporations can't have morals, they're entities and nothing more.
---
&gt;The idea that a business's only moral obligation is to the shareholders or owner is in fact a very recent idea, and as I said a deeply evil one. The idea that corporations couldn't exist otherwise is simply historically incorrect.
---
Corporations have only existed in the current sense for less than 100 years. Go back to 1920 and you'd barely be able to find companies that serviced their entire country, much less the entire planet. That was a nice catchy sentence with no substance, because the concept of both corporations and stockholders have only really existed in the modern sense since about the 1950s.
---
And blink to avoid fall damage.  Easy every time. 
---
This is correct.  You need the 12 second max rank bubble in order to safely hearth every time. 
---
Agree with everything you're saying, except for the Druid part. Druids are wonderfully fast levelers, are extremely efficient Mana wise and are excellent tank healers in raids especially with lvl 4 HT. Niche? Ya for sure. A lot of classes in vanilla are extremely niche. As for competition for gear I'm kind of confused what you mean since most groups will only take a small amount of druids 
---
I've done that one several times. On some characters I literally just die on purpose and spawn on the box. It's also a pretty brutal one.  
---
The reason I posted mine is just how freaking long it takes.  
---
Yup. Who needs feathers. 
---
The optimal strat is to run deep Frost + impact ignite in the fire tree [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgGZVVGhsbtho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZVgGZVVGhsbtho).
---
Try and get the rogue out of stealth with R1 AE and Blizzard, if the Rogue opens with Cheap Shot he's already trolling, however their are cases where this is an intentional open for skilled Rogues who will look to Gouge your Blink, you'll end up Blinking away but sitting in the Gouge CC which lets them re-Stealth and open with another Cheap Shot but this time you'll have no Blink, its over from here.
---
You do not want to tank out the Cheap Shot because they will NOT Kidney you instead it'll be an Eviscerate for 2k damage. Saving IB for Blind is usually correct, but remember you almost always have to Cold Snap the instant you come out of it, if you don't you'll get Prep Blinded without a Block ready and no Ice Barrier on. Another strat is to use Skull instead to break the second Blind (or even first), this is an advanced strat don't need to worry about it too much.
---
You'll be spamming a lot of R1 Frostbolts to keep him at range and Fire Blast off of CD which is where the Fire Talents come in handy, with the random Stuns which let you get a free cast off and the DoT to randomly break Vanishes or prevent them. Its generally best to save your Cone to knock him out of Vanish when he's close to you as it has a much bigger range than AE when talented, if he's further away be ready to R1 Blizzard a Vanish instead.
---
Also don't forget they can break Slows and Roots with the initial cast of Sprint when Talented, so if you can save your Nova for after they use Sprint.
---
You really should be beating rogues 90% of the time though, although it completely depends on skill level, what CDs are up and Engineering/Pots/Gadgets.
---
Thanks man! /s
---
It starts out rough for Mages in the early levels/gear as the Hunter pet can pretty much solo you, eventually by the time you're in AQ gear, Hunters don't really stand a chance
---
Heck I must be a shitter.   
---
Priests feels lukewarm atm imo, I play holy and the numbers are solid but the rotation is boring.    
---
Hi, /u/knotic1
---
&gt; Nobody calls retail a trash game
---
&gt; it's a trash Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying *Game*
---
Beg to differ.  The Honda Civic EJ1 is one of the most famous cars in “The Fast and the Furious” films.
---
In WoD they made PoM arcane-spec only. The way fire played in WoD and earlier expansions it already had plenty of instant pyroblasts anyway though (two crits in a row made pyro instant, that's still the main mechanic for fire mages actually). 
---
But removing PoM wasn't what killed PoM Pyro, it's just no longer a big thing when you can't one-shot someone with it, which was only a thing in vanilla. I mean making Pyro instant cast is still the only viable use out of that spell, but it was only in vanilla that it was a defining characteristic of an entire spec. 
---
Instant polymorph was also handy.
---
EF was the golden era IMO. But they're all good.
---
Great content man, keep it coming! 
---
Tips has excellent videos and when he does have an opinion to share, rather than facts, he clearly says so.  Haven't seen any elitist ranting hysterics like Alexsensual, either.
---
Really, really, *really* need to work on your reading comprehension champ.
---
Lots of older players started on WoW. They may even be the backbone of the game,  since they grew up with Dungeons and Dragons and other such things, saw computers develop, maybe played MUDs like Dragon's Gate and later the first MMOs and Blizzard Warcraft games.
---
I don't like other people killing me
---
If I bubble hearth I just go so other stuff because obviously where i was just at isn't the smartest place to back to. 
---
Mostly just not wanting to give others that satisfaction of killing me tho. 
---
Yeah when I am forced to bubble hearth that's usually my sign to do something else. 
---
&gt;not having a macro for bubble hearth 
---
??
---
Hell yeah brother you ain't teabagging this pally 
---
Btw you're totally right. Divine shield isn't 12 seconds until lvl 52 so the majority of leveling is bubble heathless 
---
Yeah I got away with it a few times, most people see the bubble hearth and just stop attacking to emote at me 
---
13
---
I’m running hunter and Druid with my brother. It’s op as fuck 
---
Yeah PoM is a really good spell. 
---
The age of MS paint is best age.
---
I knew someone would have already posted this, but as someone who's first main was a mage way back when, I had to make [this](https://i.imgur.com/DGq0CSO.png)
---
[PoM+Pyro](https://i.imgur.com/DGq0CSO.png)
---
At this point, the finance department is just hoping they still have a job.
---
I think so yes. I see a lot fewer NE hunters on pservers and around the time wow came out LOTR was also big so I think that had a huge effect on people's class fantasy choices.
---
Tons of people running around named "Legolazzz" because all 7 other versions of legolas were taken when he made his character haha
---
I did a couple of Naxx runs with a weekly pug during TBC since WotLK was around the corner and people wanted to see the old raid one last time. The guy who organised these pugs did so because his (priest) girlfriend wanted to get the legendary staff while she still could, and so all splinters were reserved for her. No problem with that, since if it weren't for them, there wouldn't be a raid anyway.
---
Too bad the priest nagged on everyone she thought wasn't pulling their weight, despite being very underwhelming herself. One time during Sapphiron, she was the designated healer for my group, and I was decursing like mad. I noticed my health dropping, but received no heals whatsoever. I popped a potion and bandage, but it wasn't enough. We wiped (as a full raid of 70s), and she suddenly starts publicly bashing into me for not decursing. How the hell am I supposed to decurse if you're leaving me to die out there?
---
Unlucky for her, I frapsed that entire encounter. You could clearly see me decursing all the way, and struggling to keep my own health up while I received no heals. I was happy to share that video of her not healing if she continued like that. She remained quiet. I was so glad I randomly decided to record that one encounter.
---
I think the increased minmaxing mentality will have a big effect. On private servers you see tons of human/orc warriors, human rogues, relatively many dwarf priests, and so on. Classic combos like night elf rogue that are mostly about RP flavor are very rare, on the other hand.
---
Fear + life/soul drain
---
I think people who return to WoW Classic but DID NOT play private servers, will gravitate towards more support and hybrid classes.  
---
Just an opinion.
---
undead rogue, undear mage. human mage, human rogue, night elf rogue
---
Did he die or something
---
Undead rogue and night elf hunters used to be memes, like pirates of the Caribbean vs Lord of the rings. 
---
 
---
something something level 17 hunter
---
The best duo. 
---
I saw the title before the picture...
---
I have a few guild drama episodes involving girls:
---
Psychopath girl starts camming with officers asking if she can be an Officer because she's been an officer before. Multiple reports of her faking a panic attack / loss of consciousness on cam.
---
Main Tank quitting because his healer GF was benched. MT started sending GM death threats over this. 
---
GMs healer gf demanding special treatment when haste gear dropped so she could hit her haste cap (this happend because she'd purposely avoided taking any haste talents).
---
GMs gf got made GM when he quit. Brought in a bunch of her random friends and made them officers, guild disbanded weeks later. 
---
Delaying Shadowform until level 45 is worth it. Wand specialization is one of the most efficient talent clusters in the Priest tree (for leveling specifically) and you can have it maxed out by level 14. You respec out of it at level 60, once you're done leveling.
---
It is crazy high value considering how much you use your wand.
---
leveled a night elf hunter but i was basically melee only. i would start off by serpent stinging them then just go in and melee lol. i just wanted to play hunter for the pet. after making it to somewhere in the 30's i rerolled rogue
---
naw there was no confirmation lol
---
Hunter pets aggro skill + any unnecessery mob in dungeon
---
I mean that's not the wrongest answer if you married a girl who let her looks go after marriage. Sometimes... you'd just rather not.
---
So, I'm gonna take the bait and explain something,
---
Racials only matter for hardcore min-maxing. 
---
&gt; You can't say that companies shouldn't be considered people, and then try and force human morality onto a concept. 
---
Sure you can. A corporation is collectively an agent, it does things. Agents can be judged morally on the basis of what they do.
---
At best you could use this line of argument to try to say that a bad corporation is more like smallpox than it is like a serial killer, but either way it's bad and there's a moral reason to stop it.
---
&gt; Corporations have only existed in the current sense for less than 100 years. Go back to 1920 and you'd barely be able to find companies that serviced their entire country, much less the entire planet. 
---
What do you think that has to do with anything? I guess you must think that moral obligations could only possibly appear when you serve a global market, or else nothing you said makes any sense, but that is such a bizarre assertion to make I can't even see a way to engage with it.
---
&gt;That was a nice catchy sentence with no substance, because the concept of both corporations and stockholders have only really existed in the modern sense since about the 1950s.
---
I suspect what is going on here is that when challenged you will trump up some definition of "the modern sense" by which of course only modern corporations are corporations in the modern sense. Which is true because it is circular but scarcely gets you anywhere.
---
But even if you were saying something meaningful it would not do you any good, because the idea that corporations have no moral obligations to anyone but the shareholders is a product of the 70s, so even in your own narrative corporations clearly predate this toxic, immoral position you are championing.
---
Thank you sir. Vanilla is about so much more than gear whoring and picking races and classes and skin tones based on that extra 0.5% advantage gain. 
---
Click out of it early to ruin the hunters aimed shot. 
---
People wont seriously make fun of you for race choice, only for sucking at the game.
---
Play what you want and earn people's respect. Oh and gear &gt; racials by far.
---
&gt; Sure you can. A corporation is collectively an agent, it does things. Agents can be judged morally on the basis of what they do.
---
This is the most liberal bullshit I've ever read. Fuck that shit dude, no you can't. You can say specific employees have shitty morals (ie. Bobby Kotick, the CEO has a shitty moral compass) but not the corporation as a whole. They are a legal entity and nothing more.
---
&gt;What do you think that has to do with anything? I guess you must think that moral obligations could only possibly appear when you serve a global market, or else nothing you said makes any sense, but that is such a bizarre assertion to make I can't even see a way to engage with it.
---
You said "The idea that a business's only moral obligation is to the shareholders or owner is in fact a very recent idea" which is just kinda dumb because corporations as a whole are a fairly recent addition to society. I think the earliest examples of anything that represent a modern corporation would be early industry barons like Carnegie Steel and Standard Oil, but those pale in comparison to large multi-national corporations that developed in the wake of World War II.
---
&gt;But even if you were saying something meaningful it would not do you any good, because the idea that corporations have no moral obligations to anyone but the shareholders is a product of the 70s, so even in your own narrative corporations clearly predate this toxic, immoral position you are championing.
---
Because stockholders were only the extremely wealthy in the early years of the stock market. You think someone working in a factory on minimum wage in 1920 is buying stocks instead of feeding their family? Of course there would be more legal protections added for stockholders as the average wage worker could afford to begin investing in the post-war era.
---
Yeah you'd think so, but when you pick a dwarf/NE warrior and look over at humans who just do 1% more dmg while you get next to nothing in return certainly does make you feel bad.
---
Shadiwguard + Blackout.
---
Just don't be an undead mage for the love of god. They're so cringe.
---
Yeah, what everyone else is saying so far.
---
I don’t care for racials so I’m going in with no feeling of obligation to have fear wards, axe/sword specialization, nor any of the other things the tryhards preach about.
---
You do you, man!  Play that NE priest and everyone who tells you otherwise can suck your purple [REDACTED].
---
1% huh? So at 60 instead of doing say 400dps, they're doing 404dps... Man I can see why you're upset... /Sarcasm
---
Racials are the least of your worries when it comes to vanilla balance issues. 
---
While they’re overpopulated to be sure, I wouldn’t say “cringe”.  That don’t make no sense to me, at least.
---
Shadowmelded MS warriors are a hell of potent combo for such a "weak" racial. So is a dwarf shrugging off poisons from hunters and rogues. 
---
Far less NE rogues is the biggest change I'd expect.
---
Best fury warrior in my old guild amd dps in general on a private server was a NE. He had edgemaster's and simply knew what he was doing and always had all consumables ready to go. Racials aren't the be all end all except in world-first guilds.
---
Sure, I agree, but it's still an annoyance to me.
---
Just look at it differently. Humans are locked into using swords and maces. Dwarves can uses Axes, Daggers, Polearms and Fist Weapons without giving up a racial slot, which means they can take weapons that drop for the good of the raidgroup and gear the group up faster. And whilst they're using their axes/daggers etc they have bonus frost resistance for surviving in Naxx and a handy active tank cooldown that's super handy on any PVE encounter involving poisons, which is lots of AQ.
---
Night Elf Warrior? Same thing. Daggers are often viewed the superior tanking weapon anyway due to how fast you can spam out Heroic Strikes when not rage starved, and with more dodge and nature resistance you can legit make a point of being "the more survivable tank". And if you get Thunderfury, the racial wont matter at all as most of the TF threat comes from the proc.
---
I'm not going to argue that humans arent better slightly, but a raidgroup as a whole would do well to have a mixture of races to capitalise on other things.
---
We're not quite sure how things are gonna look but all indications point towards retail like API. In other words if you learn to create addons for BfA it should be fairly easy to adapt them to Classic. 
---
Best server i ever played on. Great wpvp memories :D
---
Huh? WTF? 
---
I agree with your first point. A high-damage axe certainly dumps on a blue sword even with +5 skill taken into consideration. However, it doesn't help that most good one handers in the game are swords.
---
Also correct me if I'm wrong, but I think daggers lost a great deal of their usefulness in some patch in vanilla, where rage generation from damage was changed significantly. Pretty sure in 1.12.1 using Finkle's skinner is not the perfect option.
---
Scatter+fd+trap
---
I agree that just knowing how to play the game trumps any racial and sometimes even gear.
---
However, that guy in your guild would have been even higher on the charts had he just chosen human instead.
---
Exactly.
---
That remains my favorite dumb WOW meme. There's nothing you can do about it!
---
Can't hearth while falling 
---
It's cringey how they all think they're Vurtne.
---
Dwarf priest fear ward is a HUGE advantage over human or Nelf. 5 weapon skill is also a massive dps increase for rogues and warrior. It's definitely not 0.5%.
---
It's not like Horde mages have a lot of choice. Trolls don't put up much competition in terms of racials or animations.
---
Found the elitest. 
---
I would say frost is prety cool.
---
The alpha was in 2003, you're a little late : (
---
&gt; This is the most liberal bullshit I've ever read. 
---
Do you even know what "liberal" means, or is it just your all-purpose "boo" word for scary bad things?
---
&gt; You can say specific employees have shitty morals (ie. Bobby Kotick, the CEO has a shitty moral compass) but not the corporation as a whole. They are a legal entity and nothing more.
---
Yet you can take them to court for being a shitty entity and take that shitty entity's money. Because the law holds the entity responsible if it behaves in a shitty way.
---
&gt; You said "The idea that a business's only moral obligation is to the shareholders or owner is in fact a very recent idea" which is just kinda dumb because corporations as a whole are a fairly recent addition to society.
---
Like I said, the idea of the corporation predates the idea that a corporation's only moral obligation is to make money for shareholders by decades, so I don't see where this would get you *even if* it were true, which it isn't for any normal person's use of the term "recent".
---
&gt; Because stockholders were only the extremely wealthy in the early years of the stock market. You think someone working in a factory on minimum wage in 1920 is buying stocks instead of feeding their family? Of course there would be more legal protections added for stockholders as the average wage worker could afford to begin investing in the post-war era.
---
The idea that corporations are morally and legally obliged to fuck employees and the public as hard as possible is not a "legal protection for stockholders". You seem to be just making random statements that have nothing to do with the issue.
---
Yeah, I remember when they did add invisibility into the game, people were losing their shit about how OP it would be. All those complaining about it never bothered to read what it actually did, and that you lost it if you started to cast.
---
Not really, no. I like to do big damage, but I've never been in a really hardcore guild. 
---
It's not my fault that dwarf priests make some bosses completely mechanic free, or that if you want the most dps your class can do you have to choose a specific race. I think it's garbage game design, actually. But let's not pretend like it's a tiny amount. I don't play melee, but from what I understand, a huge chunk of your white damage is glancing blows, and 5 free skill points make those glancing go away or something. That's just an insane bonus. 
---
Wow wiki is incredibly outdated. I recommend using wowpedia https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft_API &amp; https://wow.gamepedia.com/Handling_events, though since we actually don't know much about classic engine other than it's 7.3.5. Since this is the case most addons will work as the changes to the api in BFA were quite minimal. 
---
Man, you are really dumb. 
---
The outrage you are speaking about also provided solutions. ActiBlizz didn't gave a fuck about either the "no loot trade whatsoever" or solutions to implement loot trade so it won't affect the game.
---
As much as I hate to say it...loot trading is in, right-click reporting is in, most likely cash shop and permanent sharding will be in, and later on, LFD and LFG, because let's face it...the people who will play Classic with permanent sharding and loot trading and right-click report, are also the ones who want LFD and LFR.
---
Classic is basically DOA at this point, after we all have witnessed the layoffs and focus on mobile, microtransactions and cost cuts policy that the cold blooded, greedy ActiBlizz considers to be "the best".
---
Yes. I was in no name and endurance on alliance side. Undecided whether I will play or not. 
---
Nahh, I grok the slop you’re slinging, just trying to point out how ridiculous you sound doing it. 
---
Stone form is amazing. The ability to clear and become immune to all poison, disease, and bleed effects is a lot more useful than you think.
---
This one should explain most of it. Gl!
---
https://youtu.be/yj_c7R2MW6s
---
Yep, I think you're right on the rage generation. You're ALWAYS goign to want to pick a weapon with a high base damage.
---
However, for tanking at least, which has no skills that rely on the weapon's damage per hit to calculate damage range (other than mortal strike if tanking as Arms) then a dagger with 1.4 speed and 50 dps will generally be much more preferable than a sword with 2.8 speed and 50 dps, because the dagger can churn out heroic strikes twice as frequently (rage dependant of course, but the dagger also gets more rage-generating strikes in between Heroic Strikes in rage starved areas).
---
Obviously a human would go for the slow sword over the fast dagger due to the racial, but the fast dagger would be the better option by far for non-humans from a tanking perspective assuming similar DPS.
---
Tauren druids..its like..they have other options!...oh wait.
---
Are you talking about the invisibility that was added later?  
---
gadgetzan teleporter + parachute cloak
---
Oh good, I thought I was the only one that hated Tips.
---
Troll mages are much better than undead mages in PvE
---
Also going to take the bait as well:  
---
They should have never had weapon skill racials.  
---
Depends on faction.  
---
Druids are somewhat less popular on Alliance because Shamans just purge their buffs/hots off. Warlocks are also a bit less popular on Alliance because of tremor totem and Will of the Forsaken.
---
That said there is also a lot less competition if you choose one of those classes. Premades are desperate for good flag runners, and Druids are the best flag runners in the game. Every guild wants Warlocks because they're a useful class to have around, and endgame caster DPS output is nuts so they're a great long term investment.
---
I did play on nathrezim, but the German one 
---
While I would LOVE a different path for WoW, and not going back to TBC&gt;Wrath&gt; etc, the massive problem I have is that ActiBlizz will never (short of a miracle) able to deliver a GOOD product.
---
We won't have TBC. We won't have a different path. We won't have additional content added to Classic. 
---
We will have Classic, and not even the one we wanted.But the one with permanent sharding (saves money for Actiblizz), right-click reporting and loot trading (cuts GM costs) and most likely cash shop (microtransactions are no.1 policy for ActiBlizz, as they said).
---
I hope  I am wrong, but I don't think I am.
---
One of my favorite instances! I ran it so often with my troll shaman in 2006 or so. 
---
"Don't melee the slimes!"
---
I did one chicken escort quest, and after that just tossed those distress beacons as soon as I saw them. Never again.
---
Definitely one of the better questlines in the game. You can get a pretty cool looking long white cloak from it too that I wore for some time.
---
I don’t see what’s cringey about undead mages. It’s a classic combo. Their other choice is a nasty clunky troll. 
---
What a strange question. 
---
Lol he doesn’t know xD
---
Is there any special things i need to pick in holy (aside ofc divine focus) or in ret?
---
An obnoxiously over done class/race combo on the server I played on was NE Priest. I never understood it because 80% of them refused to heal because they were “shadow”. 
---
There's more to vanilla wow than raiding... And you need to remember that racials goes for ALL classes. You can't just specifically tune a racial for 1 class in mind(except if that class is priest :D).
---
There's not really only one choice. Obviously dwarf priest is an exception, that shit really is too strong but the others? Nah.
---
Weapon skill on human is cool and all, but the pvp racials for dwarf, gnome hell even NE are also a big choice. Big enough for pvp + pve players like the players from Apes went all gnome on this server. 
---
Buff NE quickness? Sure if you want to further imbalance dwarf versus NE hunter... 
---
I begged for gold 
---
BC was not free epics.
---
They're much better against Beasts, but besides Maexxna is there even a beast worth caring about? Frankly it's niche use is probably on par with using WotF to break CC's early in raids.
---
Berserking is pretty whatever also. 10% speed for 10s every 3 minutes is pretty negligible, and it's questionable how long it's even worth holding it to try and get a bigger bonus when you take random splash damage, let alone that some fights won't even provide that opportunity properly.
---
As far as I'm concerned, Trolls are only better in the sense that Undead just doesn't really give you anything at all in PvE. But that's nothing to be proud of, especially when Undeads boast top tier PvP racials.
---
I'm not one of the people who think that people are blinded by their nostalgia goggles when they say they like vanilla. If pirate servers prove nothing else they prove that people still enjoy the game today.
---
But I kind of think they are blinded by nostalgia goggles when they post "OMG DAE look forward to guild drama, loot drama, ninja looters, griefing, scamming, blood plague, Kazzak kiting, bugged mobs, server crashes and weekly maintenance?". That stuff makes for fun stories to tell years afterwards, but it's bad times when it happens to you.
---
Troll racials are arguably better for PvE. Berserking is always more DPS, everything the undead mage gets is situational and mostly irrelevant.
---
no
---
"vanilla veteran btw"
---
We were messing around in guild boosting our low level alts through gnomer being lead by one of our lvl 60 palas, we get to the trench run and everyone is not taking it too seriously. Our lowest level guy in there (waaaay too low) starts tailoring or leather working or something to one side and somehow manages to pull every mob from around the tops and the rest of the trench. I'd never seen so many mobs at once. Not to fear our pala pops consecration and has ret aura active so they'll kill themselves and he'll barely feel a thing. 
---
Except he does feel a thing and his health drops fast. Not one to take risks he bubbles and hearths back to IF leaving us to be massacred in horrific ways. There was much laughing and mockery amid the death cries. I valiantly try to vanish my way to safety but it doesn't work, instead I sprint my way back to the dungeon entrance thinking to leave our pala a gift of a thousand mobs when he enters again. I was laughing to myself like a crazy person at the idea but: we'd taking the shortcut and dropped down avoiding the stairs and the sanctuary room bit so I run headfirst into more mobs.
---
It, well it didn't end well for me but I laughed harder that day than I had for a while.
---
I can live without the Drama in my own Guild tbh. But I will read the Drama from other Guilds with pleasure, not gonna lie. LMAO
---
Don't bother dude.
---
Blizzard spoke openly about some kind of new addon system that does not allow some of the newer addons.
---
The underlying code 'might' be the same as live wow, but even if it is, your addons might not even be allowed.
---
I legit wouldn't bother till we have more info. 
---
logical comment for once. The retail wow forums and these forums know jack shit about the workforce. 
---
Both sexes have responsibility in many of these examples.
---
But ultimately it's the males' fault because they far outnumber the females. Any single demeritorious male or female can't do that much damage to a guild. They'll be singled out, disciplined, or kicked.
---
But when you have a gaggle of crooked thinking GMs, officers, and members feeding into a single detrimental (female) player - that's when things break down for the entire guild.
---
For this reason it is absolutely the greater responsibility of the males in the guild for such degeneration. If they just behaved logically and responsibly any single odd person out wouldn't be able to destroy an entire guild.
---
yeah.. I did that a lot.
---
Also, it would require serious hoop jumping to make flasks . . .
---
Genuine question: is it a useful trait?
---
About to log off anyway? Don’t feel like running 15 minutes just to ress? 
---
Nothing ironic about the combo at all. 
---
The bats that need to be killed in one of the phases silence players. So even if the pallies wanted to aoe they couldn't. And single target dpsing them down is too slow for even normal dps classes.
---
I think that phase alone wipes the group 
---
lmao like ima give up a fun game just cause some people I don't know got fired. You might as well give up every game then because this happens at every company.
---
human warriors/rogues are always the most popular combination on every private server ever
---
Uhh sure if you respec many times, but they start much lower than 50g and have diminishing returns
---
Undead are still the most popular race in WoW. That's never going to change. 
---
Trolls will be the least played race for sure.
---
**So regarding the races on the Horde side, I don't think there will be a huge change.**
---
I think the class population will shift though.
---
Warriors are the best Class in WoW and more people will stick with a Warrior, especially since we know now that the leveling process is very slowly, but the benefits of a lvl 60 Warrior are HUGE.
---
Now that we know that Hunter and Druid are very underwhelming, I think these classes will be hit with a massive population loss. 
---
I also think more people will play Priests and Shamen on the Horde side. Feels like especially Priests have gained massive popularity.
---
You could bubble hearth in the 34-51 range as well, as lots of people in the level range 34-51 didn't know to keep a swing timer or instant ability for the last 1.5 seconds of the cast. A lot of them actually gave up attacking you once they realized they couldn't damage you and just left. Leveling my paladin I only experienced a single instance of someone stopping my bubble HS.
---
No. The reason fast weapons are good for threat is because Heroic Strike is a fixed amount of threat and occurs on next swing. In rage limited situations you don't use HS much because it costs not only its rage cost, but also cannot generate rage on the hit the way the white hit it is replacing would have. Now if a fight is at all challenging, your rage is infinite because the boss should be hitting you fairly hard. If the fight isn't hard, you take off tank gear, put on DPS gear, and now the boss is hitting you fairly hard and you again have infinite rage. 
---
TL;DR: Every good Warrior tank keeps a 1.3 speed dagger in his bags (among many other things). 
---
hm... my favorite quest in terms of reward is the whirlwind axe quest. you get that and suddenly it feels like your character doesnt suck
---
my favorite quest in terms of mechanics/objectives is tough
---
however, i do LOVE the absolute swarm of stitches from the duskwood chain. on new servers sometimes it gets so out of hand that the npcs are just permanently dead for hours at a time. optionally, you can group up with a bunch of idiots and work together to kite stitches to westfall and cause some serious havoc
---
Let me guess; it involved a princess and *someone* getting rock-hard.
---
bc is better than vanilla, stop typing.
---
Actually embriel is right, it's going to use the retail API but they'll limit some parts of it for classic. So for practice purposes bfa api is fine.
---
People forget that the NE racial is the strongest racial in an owPvP situation, stronger than fear ward even. Being able to go invisible is huge for a caster, even if it only works out of combat and you can't move.
---
You can go shadowmeld while waiting for a quest mob to spawn. You can avoid corpse camping just by getting to your corpse and going drink+shadowmeld the moment you resurrect. Even if the enemy finds you after a while, you will be on full mana.
---
You can just go shadowmeld prior a fight and the enemy will likely focus someone else instead, like a paladin.
---
&gt; some kind of new addon system that does not allow some of the newer addons
---
They're not changing the addon system, what they're doing is:
---
1. use the modern API because the vanilla one was overpowered so *old* addons like decurse won't work at all
---
2. they will "limit" the modern API to disallow some things they said they feel don't belong to Classic (we don't know which functions yet)
---
That doesn't prevent anyone from *learning* how to develop an addon, you just have to adapt it or rewrite it when Classic is out, but you can still learn.
---
member heroic magisters terrace?
---
Dwarf racial bonus +5 gun skill, but at end game bows reign supreme (until / unless you're lucky and get to Ahn'Qiraj).
---
On the other hand there are other reasons to pick dwarf instead of night elf. So it's important to check the fuller picture.
---
I really hate that random continents just keep popping up whenever the story needs it.
---
they only matter if you try winning biggest e-pen.... competition.
---
vanilla is about having fun, so try that instead of that little little dps increase you get from some stuff. no one cares in raids or dungeons unless you as previously stated trying to max max it..
---
Undead rogue/warlock/mage/priest on horde. Night elf hunter and human anything on alliance. 
---
Min/max race/class combos will be more common now. Like human rogue/warrior, dwarf priest, gnome mage/warlock. And whatever the horde equivalent is.
---
But humans and undead will still be by far the most popular races, we have seen no reason to believe that would change. The most popular classes might change a bit, with more people playing dps warrior than in classic for example (mostly due to 1.12 talents and stuff). 
---
Ima roll paladin just for this
---
My favourite quests are always the beginner quests after creating a new character. Kill 6 mindless zombies? Yes sir!
---
At least on private servers the escort quest in redridge is just stupid. It's straight up just a difficult quest with all the mobs in and around that cave. Then on top of that you have almost no chance of finishing the last walk along the road to lakeshire without some max level horde showing up and killing you all, including the escort NPC. No point in even trying to do that quest. 
---
I think the most common race/class combinations from back in the day will differ a bit this time around.
---
More people will min/max their racials this time around, and I think the Alliance races are the most susceptible to min/maxing like that because the Alliance racials are more specialized than their Horde counterparts.
---
There ought to be fewer NE Warriors/Rogues/Priests, fewer Human Paladins/Warlocks/Mages/Priests and a lot fewer Trolls in general over on Horde side since those racials are the most tied to class specific mechanics.
---
I predict a very even split between Tauren, Orc and Undead on Horde.
---
I heard June 16. might be a possible date for release. Any updates on this matter? 
---
Is there any news on what the minimum/recommended specs will be? I thought maybe similar to the updated engine its using but I'm not sure
---
Of course undead rogue.
---
&gt; You can get a pretty cool looking long white cloak from it too that I wore for some time.
---
Is it white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape?
---
Not gonna lie.  No idea who that is.
---
Illumination is why you are going into the holy tree.
---
"Liberal" as in braindead.
---
Poor things, when will they stoo hurting themselves? 
---
Sounds to me like you don’t know nothing about game philosophy. Respect cost is needed, if you didn’t know. And, as others have already mentioned, mages can farm gold very easy 
---
That is precisely why they shouldn't implement dual spec. That way every player would be on the best spec for every encounter. You wouldn't see a fury tank in dungeons, so those who commit to tanking and are prot specced wouldn't really be anything special. Same for pvpers. 
---
Socialists are really bad at understanding simple things hehe. Oh well mmm.
---
It's useless. It might be nice while leveling a Troll Warrior tough.
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/76459
---
This is the specs for retail, the minimum is very easily attainable for very cheap. GPU+CPU is less than $60.
---
I think it's fair to assume that the minimum specs for retail would run the Classic game pretty easily. 
---
Concerning modern games themselves I genuinely think that there's a strong case to be made regarding the objective quality, or lack of quality, in terms of how they appeal to us as human beings on a psychological level - granting a sense of achievement, that kind of stuff. 
---
However I find that often today people can't handle it if you were to criticise something they like subjectively. That could be with anything; food, tv shows etc. I think most of us, when we're ragging on retail WoW, aren't criticising any person for liking it, we are criticising the game itself and that at the end of the day is someone happens to like it then fine, who really cares about any one person's tastes? I guess further to what you're saying we could all do well to make that distinction and keep things chill. 
---
No official release date yet. Still planned for summer 2019.
---
The one and only time i hated racials was when Humans got a free pvp trinket. Before that, man that shit is fine and unique
---
&gt;benefits of a lvl 60 Warrior are HUGE
---
Also the class that requires the most work and time invested into it by FAR. I can list off a dozen things why this class is the least new player friendly class in the game if you like. Just TL;DR is that they require so much more effort than any other class and I've known players to burn out and give up long before they're anywhere near pre-raid BiS.
---
Or he disliked playing human after 40 levels and quit the game ghehe
---
It's more like 2-3% iirc. So it's noticeable on damage meters. 
---
Good for you. Other people find it fun and challenging and those ZG trinkets help with that.
---
I don't really care for tanking, so id rather heal/do dps 
---
Holy ret it is then. dmg and heal is nice, because i enjoy both. 
---
&gt;10% speed for 10s every 3 minutes is pretty negligible
---
????
---
This is a full blown cooldown. Almost on par with Icy Veins. This isn't not negligible. 
---
oh boy, guild drama is hot shit! 
---
Not classic but BC, My m8 and I were in a guild of casuals but we often partied up with another guild to fill in spots. They were small (thus needed fillers sometimes) but were serious about raiding and our own guild wasn't very good at raiding, struggling with kara. My friend an I would often show up wearing T4 pieces we won the previous week with the other guild to our casual guild runs and the GM would get upset because he thought it was like "cheating" on the guild. 
---
Like, nah, you guys just are not progressing and not pushing yourselves enough to down bosses. Excuse us for taking opportunity when we can. Oh, I love some good drama! 
---
We left and permanently joined the other guild around T5, when they needed new recruits for Tempest Keep. 
---
You're basically asking for biology to stop being a motivating factor in actions. Which will never happen when there aren't really major consequences. It's not like a formal office setting.
---
Icy Veins was 20% for 20 seconds. But apparently having half the duration AND half the effect is almost on par, alright.
---
*don't you dare say shit like this about trolls.*
---
they do make shit mages, though, berserking is negligible bonus in PvE, and in PvP, undead wins by a large margin. they still are the sexiest motherfuckers on the horde, though.
---
I never said it would stop him learning. I just suggested waiting till we know what we're developing on/for as apart from addons veing restricted we just don't know.
---
At the end of the day I suppose it depends what the OP wants to do. HP bars etc, he should be relativly safe with. But if you build a mod that isn't going to be allowed, no amount of adapting it is going to make it work in Classic.
---
At the end of the day a heavily restricted current API is just that. Who knows what will work and what won't. Hell they might even re-write it completely.
---
If he wants to learn live, go ahead. But we just don't know yet when it comes to Classic. Which is why I'm waiting
---
berserking is next to nothing when it comes to PvE, WotF however is a gigantic bonus. while trolls are amazing, they just don't have enough of an edge to be worth it when it comes to mages.
---
Rolling a human prot warrior with blacksmithing(probably armorsmith). What reputation grinds are the most beneficial for me?
---
Nahh, you're just salty you got exposed lmao. See ya.
---
They've never said this. They said they wish to limit the addons available at Blizzcon but it was still a work in progress.
---
It's entirely possible (though unlikely) that they re-write a new api for classic. Even if they don't though, a heavily restricted API is exactly what I said. I'm holding off till I know more as many are. I don't wish to waste time learning and crafting something that won't be allowed. 
---
In a 5 minute boss fight you might've earned 1 extra frost bolt with this racial! Impressive.
---
Actually they never said anything about a new api, they did mention using modern api and limiting some functionalities like those allowing group finders and such so yeh, pretty much what I said.
---
They may create a new api copying and limiting the modern api though, either way knowing modern api is gonna get you 80% there.
---
It’s likely going to be a very late summer release. They have yet to announce a beta. 
---
&gt; berserking is next to nothing when it comes to PvE
---
We're talking about tiny differences, certainly, but that's true of all DPS racials. +10% haste for 1/18th of the time seems like it should be a 0.5% DPS boost, going as high as 1.25% if you can trigger it when you take some damage. People want human and orc racials for DPS boosts of about 1%, so they should want the troll racial.
---
If you PvP at all I think undead is so much better it's not funny. But if all you do is shovel DPS, troll does have the edge. And one more relevant button to push.
---
Are you drunk or something
---
Well we do tend to call people "retailers" a lot.
---
Tauren warrior+thunderfury
---
With the exception of pandas the rest aren’t random in the Warcraft universe.
---
Northrend for example is on just about every in-game map you see around vanilla
---
I still remember the one time it didn't work for me. I was in the gurubashi arena vs like 5 horde and I popped bubble hearth. But the global cooldown didn't seem to have triggered on the hearthstone so I clicked it twice. But what happened in result is by clicking it twice I reset the casting time, which wasn't long enough for the bubble and I died
---
Comments here are correct. On private servers very few players care about the RP aspect of races. Things like Night Elf Rogue are almost nonexistent despite being immensely popular in 2004 vanilla. 
---
On private servers the focus is entirely on minmaxing and getting the most out of the different racials. 
---
I think Classic will have a similar culture. Even though retail players tend to be more casual and a lot of them have never played vanilla. 
---
Consequence should be reaction of the community, not some external tool.
---
Endurance was doing Naxx right? 
---
True, if the class was any different, we would have like 50% warriors.
---
The percentige of warrior mains is still going to be very high with all the downsides. 
---
Charge+Hamstring?
---
Probably not as useful but still an important pair to be sure
---
It's not even a choice. If you're a mage, you should go undead.
---
The rest are pretty random. If Kul Tiras and Zandalar would've been so big and big of a deal, they should've mattered in the god-knows-how-many world-ending events prior to BFA.
---
How I imagine being caught naked feels.
---
It's true, but the disadvantage of rolling human is that your racials will forever be shit in PvP. Perception has some niche utility, but it doesn't compare to anything another race could bring.
---
Tauren + burger bun
---
maybe there wont be a beta at all?
---
If your going 1 handed may as well heal and play support role.
---
I've had pallies bubble hearth against me in WSG before
---
Lol your rogues name reminded me of this fun guild I was in called ”Verinen Kives” (Bloody testicle in Finnish) which was a tribute of some sort for the other more serious Finnish Guild called ”Verinen Kirves” (Bloody axe). Server was Dunemaul I think.
---
But you can Pom frost. I swears it. Can still pull off 1 and 2 shots as frost.
---
I always cringe when people complain over racials and I think to myself "Yeah I agree, racials should be more balanced so we can play what we think looks coolest and still be competitive in PvP" only to read that the OP is talking about PvE...
---
The human and orc racials are way more than 1%
---
This video *again*.
---
How do you "literally" get 12,000 gold per hour?
---
Well if you still chose to spend money on Blizzard Activision products, you really have no right to be pissed off about employes being laid off. At the very least it's very hypocritical. 
---
Aux defaults to listing them one at a time, which is probably what happened with the linen.
---
Although the price per item is slightly better for singles, so on more expensive items, people do it intentionally.
---
People here saying they see less of a race/class combo on private servers forget that Classic WoW will have a lot more casual and/or typical retail players that will continue the trend of picking the “cool” race. 
---
The game mechanics are weird. Guns and bows don't glance, so it doesn't matter nearly as much as melee weapon skill.
---
Maybe we don't agree on the term "system".
---
API change constantly and addons are updated because of that, it's not changing the *system*, just functions the system uses.
---
You're right we don't know what will work and what won't but I highly doubt they'll rewrite them completely, it doesn't make sense considering what they said so far.
---
The weakauras discord has a channel where you can ask about addon dev (for other addons). That place is probably your best bet when it comes to getting help while making your addons. 
---
Far too many Rogues on PvP servers, for obvious reasons
---
Lol you can’t release a game without bug testing. It doesn’t matter that’s not a new game. 
---
or on a PvP server:
---
gnome rogue, human rogue, night elf rogue, dwarf rogue, undead rogue, troll rogue, orc rogue
---
Agreed here. You get the most benefit out of reckoning by using a slow 2h and seal of righteousness. Seal of command can only proc off the first swing, so the trailing (up to) 4 swings do not get the seal effect, whereas seal of righteousness damage is added to all swings.
---
In general, slow weapons have high top end damage and when you get 5 instant attacks pop you would rather those attacks be with a 2h weapon that hits for 450 each (450*=2,250) as opposed to a 1h that hits for 150 each (150*5=750)
---
I hope this makes sense, recking is all about burst. As a healing build in pvp you want to heal, heal, heal, unload those 5 stacks for 3k damage and get back to healing 
---
Anyone who's played vanilla at max level will have learned the advantages of picking a class that can tank or heal.
---
Well you're free to try and farm out a ironfoe to make a 1h pvp build but your time will be better spent playing a normal version of holy or ret pvp builds and just swapping weapons when out in the world.
---
Amazing work, you sent me back to good memories :)
---
My experience is only Legion onward, so would it be ok to do mining and engineering as professions for a warlock, or is the second very complex for player used to retail? I don't need to make tons of gold, it's just for making myself things probably most of the time.
---
I'd say no more than 10% of Classic players will have never played the game before.
---
Private servers are an accurate representation of what Classic will be like. Prepare to reserve loot in Wailing Caverns. 
---
Tauren will be massively lower than Orc and Undead. 
---
Even worse is that different races have different base stats.
---
The silence can be outranged and dispelled by the healers.
---
Now you are just desperately grasping at straws. How often does a Warrior seriously use their ranged weapon to do damage, and how often does that actually have any meaningful impact on how the fight goes? Close to never.
---
Always attempted, and always abandoned. The pathing is aids, you are fish in a barrel for wPvP, and the amount of time it required was insane. 
---
Best combo whilst leveling is Mining/Skinning for $$$. 
---
Leveled with Reck + SoC recently myself and afaik you can only proc command once in a reckbomb, it still fun though. Used a 2-hander but ive been suggested to use 1h and seal of light instead. I think its a matter of trial and error, in the end a lot of the fun in vanilla, from my perspective, is messing around with wacky mixed builds :) what you suggest could theoretically work I guess!
---
That of course only applies if they allow you to build stacks of reck with a sit macro in classic, which may not be the case(Im not up to date on this specific point) If they wont allow you to stack up manually through sitting down the potential of reck builds fall off quite a bit :/ 
---
That fucking sinew... I need a hug. Someone. Please...
---
Damn, its normal that you feel backstabbed.  
---
The thing is, there will always be people like that in the world.. but you just have to find those who are worth it, you were a lil unlucky
---
There are 2 types of pallys: those that bubble hearth, and liars. 
---
Hence I am here asking hehe. Farming Ironfoe is a pain, so was hoping someone had some prior experience beforehand, letting me know, if it was worth the grind or not.. xD
---
We had a guildie rage quit over petty shit in retail vanilla. He rerolled a Druid 1-60 secretly then applied to guild. He was caught just moments before our 1st Cthun kill that dropped dark edge which he planned on ninjaing. I miss those crazy people.
---
It can be so fast sometimes. You go to bed one night, and when you come back a few hours later, half the guild had /gquit or your end up without a guild for whatever reason 😂
---
That’s a 50 DKP Minus!
---
It’s usually the top tier guilds that avoid major drama as long as it’s not loot council.
---
This is exactly what I was saying. 1H + SoR is more about stacking things that can proc off of SoR, instead of relying on the weapon dmg itself along with the chance to get an SoC proc off of the first swing. The time investment to test this however, is huge, so was hoping someone had some experience to share.. xD  
---
Well, idea was to mostly heal, and only really use Reckbombs once melee focuses you. You can easily stock up while just healing, and then unleash hell when needed, or to assist in a kill. Also, both locks and hunters tend to send their pets after healers, to cause spell pushback, and they are a lovely source of reck stacks as well.. xD
---
It's not even worth grinding for fury warriors. It's possibly BiS based on proc rates but the fact it's a 1% drop chance off a boss that takes at least 20-30 minutes to do and is heavily contested by both fury and prot warriors means your chances of actually getting it is extremely low. 
---
As I said your time would be better spent using a normal spec and I guess trying to farm out r14 or raid weapons which will net you a much larger upgrade anyway.
---
This is exactly what I intend to do, as described in the OP. ;P  
---
The reckbombs are purely for wPvP, and to scare off melee training you while healing in BGs, or assist in the odd kill once in a while. xD
---
Yeh that’s a good strategy, healing, buffs and reck bombs is why pally is best pvp class in wow and why I’m going alliance this time.
---
Depends if you're going for PVPing to any major degree or just happy being a Healing Raider and PVE DPS when solo/5mans.
---
For PVE you'd probably go something like this:

---
For PVP you'd go something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxuzxZZV0xtrfVo
---
But there's loads of options really. Improved Seal of the Crusader is barely used so taking that is purely if you want to try a minmax pure dps build, otherwise you'll generally judge Wisdom for mana in PVE. Imp Judgement isnt very good due to Judgement's mana cost.  In PVP you tend to use Ret aura over Sanc, and Sanc aura is a really small boost anyway even in PVE. 
---
Even the holy tree has a bunch of options as you kinda want the uninterruptible heals for pvp and even a handful of pve encounters, but for flat output 10% str and 10% int is just better.
---
Even Imp Might isnt very strong, and could easily be skipped in a pvp build, though for raiding it'll be great to have. 
---
The key talents are basically Illumination, Divine Focus and Healing Light from Holy, and Benediction, Conviction, SoComm, Vengeance and PoJ from Ret. Everything else is personal choice based on how much you plan to PVE Heal, PVE DPS and PVP.
---
Sadly the sit macro did not work in vanilla and thus will most likely not work in classic either.
---
You didn't make any points though. You just talked shit about retail and retail players and their ability to discuss the game. 
---
Where is the nuance that you talked about? You say that Vanilla fans can discuss retail intelligently while retail fans are just rabid zealots but your entire reply was pretty rabid. 
---
I don't really see any difference between "your love of vanilla is nostalgia" and "retail is a dogshit mmo." - There is no more intelligence or nuance in the second statement than the first. 
---
By "extensive addons" do you mean one single addon which allows you to easily post individual items? (Either auctioneer or aux, btw)
---
Well, this is pretty much what I wrote in the OP. But well put. ;P
---
The only thing to note tho, is that items that add en extra swing like e.g. Ironfoe and Hand of Justice, only can proc from the first swing and then all the SoR procs, not the actual reck hits. This was changed in 1.12, mostly to combat something about Windfury, it just happened to also affect Reck.
---
As for 2H vs 1H, I understand the dilemma comepletely. But as my primary role will be support, I would prefer running 1H+shield, swapping weapons however, removes any reck stacks, so either I heal BGs with a 2H and hit for a ton, or I choose a 1H like Ironfoe or Teebu's Blazing Longsword, or even Lok'amir, to pair it with a shield, and hit for less. Shields are just such a nice source of extra armor. xD 
---
But this begs the questions, is 1H reckbombs even worth the investment then? Or would I be better off running a 2H all the time, or just picking up Holy Shock instead.. :E 
---
The game sure has changed ... I remember my favorite alliance zones were the trifecta of Duskwood-Redridge-Westfall and in that order.
---
this. wondering why this build hasnt been talked about its the non plus ultra lategame build for pve under the condition ur raid doesnt force u to spec trueshot aura and very strong in pvp
---
Night elf- Druid , Tauren-Druid :)
---
The axe from Onyxia is great for 1h shadowreckoning but if you can get your hands on a TF you should aim for that for the extra onhit every swing . The epic sword from ST is awesome aswell , the one that spawns little dragonkin. Some 1 handers from Naxx with a lot of SP are nice aswell . 
---
For trinkets maelstorm , zandalari hero charm , other spell power trinkets , heart of wyrmthalak are go to choices.
---
As far as 2handers go R14 weapons are your best bet up until AQ i would say . During naxx corrupted ashbringer is your BiS 4ever.
---
I distinctly remember bubble hearthing on my lvl ~20 paladin in early vanilla.
---
I forget, could you counterspell Aimed Shot?
---
Gott DAMN, the 2nd occasional Pom Pyro you got out of 8/8 Netherwind was enough reason for me to touch myself back then.
---
Nice story mate had me laughing
---
&gt; content creators 
---
I smear dogshit on the face of whoever came up with that asinine term.
---
ITT ppl backwards calculating how old they would have been
---
Cut the intro. It's way too long and adds nothing to the video.
---
I believe Mealstrom + a spell power trinket is going to be BiS but then again it depends on what stuff that i've seen from private servers are not accurate so really cant tell until we get to play the actual game live.But having Wyrm to swap between the sp trinket when its on cd is nice.
---
That boe mace that has a chance to  remove the cast time of your next spell is also nice as hell in a battleground setting if you plan on healing
---
Id wait until more clarification from blizz. It actually seems like day 1 we might be playing without addons lol
---
and ya those dragons hit like little trucks so its pretty devastating if you can get a few up in a single bomb .
---
Wouldn't a weapon swap macro let you do both?  Equip that slow 2 hander for the bomb then swap back.
---
The /sit command was/is a private server bug.
---
Blizzard patched it to only proc stacks from abilities like sinister strike etc. Regular white hits will not build up stacks or blood craze etc
---
I remember! So funny in retrospect
---
8% I believe. 
---
What will be the main difference leveling from 1-10 as a Tauren in Classic vs. Retail? Or other areas that havent been changed
---
Mana is critical so  I disagree, mana talent is must have. 
---
Some of the best pserver players pick pvp racials ovrr pve yet still dominate the pve scene. It really isnt a big deal.
---
This is a question for people with lots of horde experience - How common are priests vs shamans on horde?  
---
I want to roll both but I think I may not have time for both, so maybe stick to my all time favorite - priest, however my duo buddy is rolling warrior.  
---
As a continuation of the first question, how common are they in raids? Usually get 4-5+ resto shams? What about priests?
---
What is the rep gain from flag captures in WSG?   
---
What is the rep gain from winning/losing AB?   
---
What is the rep gain from the mark of honor quest: For great honor? (Where you turn in all three rep marks)
---
Cool!
---
Thank you for ideas and insight
---
Or they just convert wep skill racials to 1% hit. I get the theory, most every race has some kind of "leveling" passive bonus, and +wep skill is great for that 1-59. However like so many of the issues with Vanilla, Blizzard did not fully understand the implications of their design choices at lvl 60 and only later got around to fixing them.
---
Unfortunately not. It worked in early vanilla, but was changed so that you loose all reckoning stacks when weaponswapping.. :E
---
That's a great idea!  
---
Im pretty sure Maelstrom is BiS, HoJ is fairly low proc,but is worth x2 as it not only procs an extra swing, but also an extra SoR, and thereby an extra chance to proc everything else. Else SP trinket + a swap line Wyrm sounds like a solid alternative.  
---
We need to be swapping at least one trinket slot often anyway, with PvPtrinket, Tidal and so on, dependent on the situation.. :P  
---
Hand of Edward the Odd, nice indeed. It is great for certain opponents or comps, or if you get trained a lot without getting the option to reckbomb them. It has very fast speed, which is shit for bombs, but is great for proccing the free spells. I'll def be carrying this in my bags! xD
---
With *THIS* **ONE** ***CRAZY*** Trick!!
---
&gt; Isn't it too easy if you have full gear?
---
It was much too easy when Cata was live - we cleared MC with 15 dudes at level 55. Seeing as how the XP is distributed below 100, people will be hitting 60 in under a day \/played, and challenge is non-existent in the open world anyhow. It's a nice publicity stunt, but has *nothing* to do with a Vanilla experience.
---
White hits should still proc it, but forcing a critical from /sit doesn't 
---
Every time I see this guy I think about my uncle. 
---
My severe-drinking-Problem uncle. 
---
Shamans are incredibly useful in classic due to wind fury. All shaman specs have access to it, though in raiding you will be mostly playing restoration. Totems only effect the other players in the party, not the whole raid, so having multiple shamans has tons of merit. Grace of air totem also helps magical DPS. Mana tide totem is also very welcome to stack in a healer group to maintain great heals. Priests are the best all around healers. They have multiple healing styles and specs you can build, so they're great if you want flexibility. Leveling with a warrior, if you go enhancement, you'll do good damage and be able to heal PLUS buff the crap out of your friend. With that build, it's actually really good to find nice isolated grind spots and really try to maximize the mana per cast of your totems (chain pulling mobs to the radius of the totems and have your buddy tank them). You'll be surprised how high your xp per hour will go.
---
Awesome! I did this a long time ago when Project 60 first became a thing, but to be honest the dungeons and raids were a complete joke, we were able to 10 man BWL and some people in the guild were able to 4 man MC with just hunters :\
---
It's fun for sure, but that on top of the actual world being completely different from vanilla due to the Cataclysm, it got boring pretty fast
---
Also leveling was a complete joke even without BOAs, I was a mage and was able to just round up a bunch of mobs and AOE them down without ever even coming close to dying, even with all of them beating on me &gt;&lt;
---
Quests will be harder obviously, it'll take you longer to down a mob and they'll hit harder. Be careful with humanoids once you leave the first area of Mulgore. That and a few landscapes have changed, especially in the first zone. Not sure if I answered the question the way you expected it though.
---
Engineering is beneficial to any class, especially if you play PvP. It's gonna be harder than retail but I guess you already know that :D
---
Project 60 is a joke. Was watching it on twitch a while back. Some dudes 5manned all of BWL up to chromaggus and then got stuck there for two hours because mages dont have access to fire and arcane spells when Frost and they had to wipe over and over until they got the right vulnerabilities.
---
I think i would rather wait for classic than get what Cat:BFA version changed classic to.
---
Yeah, some additional points of agility sure is equal to 25% stun resistance.
---
Makes sense. I definitely want the leveling process especially in the beginning areas to take longer so I can enjoy it more.
---
For level 60 warrior running (tank) dungeons to gear up for raiding, what the recommended spec that also keeps you viable for world PvP?
---
How is the herb situation with Rogues? Fadeleaf was common IIRC but Swifthisle is probably rare since it doesn't spawn on its own; so is it maybe worth it to go herbalism on a rogue or is it reasonable to just buy your own stuff? I kidna wanna go engineering but not having herbs seems like an offputting thing. 
---
The only 1h reckoning build that's viable for anything really is the full Prot build. Something like 14/32/5, or 20/31/0. Basically full prot with 1h Spec, Reckoning, Divine Int + Imp Seal of Righteousness. 
---
This is basicaly the 5man dungeon tank build. The other versions of prot are either the prot/ret pure pvp build which doesnt really work outside of private servers due to /sit not forcing white crits on live, and the 30/21/0 Holy build with BoSanc which doesnt go high enough to get Reckoning anyway, and if you're going that high you may as well get 1h spec and Holy Shield and go all-in.
---
These quests are really fkin worth because they basically give twice the xp a normal quest does. And then when you go to booty bay to turn in your last (3rd one) you get a chain (4th) that is basically just talk to the NPC again and you get the pet and another quest worth of xp. 
---
That's just your time-distorded nostalgia talking for you. Take off the off color rose tinted colored glasses and you'll see vanilla really isn't that great.
---
 ^^^/s
---
 I've had friends who're in the same situation as you, I met them.. during legion, because they somehow never had played wow before, only to tell them all about the game, leveled up with them, told them the lore of the current game.. Duo'd dungeons with them to show them at their own pace.
---
 During most of it, I also told them how it was in other xpacks.. Later on, they asked me if i could show them how to get on a pserver. And lo-and behold. they enjoyed it ten fold. weird how a new-to wow legion player enjoys classic more. *hmmm. but all dem features in legion tho clearly make a better game??? 
---

Hi, /u/Neheb2
---
Lmao looks like most people agree with me from the down votes.Its not mind boggling. The weapon make a bugger difference for the warriors.
---
I hope it changes, idk why every damn Horde Druid was a Tauren
---
"What's your favorite ethnic slur?"
---
&gt; I just want to pick a character I like and not be objectively at a disadvantage and laughed into oblivion by raid groups.
---
You are overestimating both the importance of this racial advantage and the reaction of other players.   Except for every alliance raid wanting to have at least a few fear ward dwarves, it is not important at all 
---
I heard that the human weapon racial gives a ~5% damage done boost.
---
Should be similar for orcs when using axes.
---
Something tells me you've been kicked from more guilds then you can count for being a creepy asshole to women in said guilds. 
---
Screams of the past on draka got old once cataclysm hit. Was a good replacement for WotLK though! 
---
I'm still going to pay my troll rogue. Min-maxing be damned, I want a character model I like looking at and trolls are cool as fuck.
---
Check out Drakova's videos, he explores 1h reck in pvp.
---
I’ve played on pservers for 2 years and haven’t done much raiding by want to as a warrior in classic (atm have a 56 warrior on pserver trying to raid soon) and this is very good to hear. I want to try and attain the r10 shoulders in classic, while also raiding, and I thought the respec costs were really going to hurt me. 
---
Yeah but a long quest can be really good, it gives you a goal to keep thinking about so the 50% of a level you just ground out didnt feel so boring!
---
Retail is catered to the short burst lootbox style for Chinese market. Same reason they made MoP.
---
yeah and what about meeting people and making new friends with the double bonus of avoiding the joke that is BFA content
---
Main quitting range is level 20-30.
---
This is a community project, not a mythic raiding guild
---
Well yeah, levelling is obviously quicker. Main problem in the raids is that you do too much damage. I guess going with fewer people would help, but that's not very fun. Even with everyone in white gear we killed stuff real fast. 
---
There definitely were some mechanics that killed you though, wasn't entirely trivial. But I think that was mostly in TBC when we went on to that, which was also when we started to need to use some gear. 
---
Vanilla raids are so silly with modern class design though. Healing raid damage or decursing or whatever isn't exactly a big "mechanic" any more. Like even if they tuned them higher a lot of the fights would still not be difficult at all. Also some of them are just so simple that most people know exactly what to do after like 2-3 wipes. You're practically never getting overwhelmed by stuff like you are in retail. 
---
Hating older things is a symptom of the hipster movement. They hate anything old and want to always be the first to the new thing. 
---
It’s why Roundhead Rian Johnson destroyed Star Wars. He is a manbaby hipster and hated the old Star Wars movies and wanted his vision, he perverted everything Star Wars and it’s dead now. Subverting expectations is hipster speak for doing opposite of what fans want and it’s a common trope now.
---
I did this once after burning out of hardcore raiding with a group of dude, but for tbc content. the content was trivialized but you made your own challenges and ultimately it was socially rewarding and memorable.
---
8% sounds too high, and that's in no way insignificant. If it's that high then the whole "it only matters if you're hardcore min/maxing" isn't even really true any more. That would affect pretty much any raider. 8% damage boost is a lot for anyone. 
---
I was very attracted of the Project 60 idea a few month ago until I realized that the stat squish to BFA release killed the whole item progression in raids until Legion. Basically every item in Vanilla content is ilvl58. In TBC it‘s ilvl70 and in Wotlk it‘s ilvl100 you can get no matter if you kill KelThuzad or Lich King. Blizz fucked up everything it is so sad.
---
it is that high. I don't understand the surprise, it's not like this game was designed by hardcore discord theorycrafters.
---
If there was only one choice for Priests, why are Dwarf Priests so rare?
---
Something to think about. 
---
&gt; I don't understand the surprise
---
I'm surprised because I was pretty sure the numbers I've heard from other sources were much lower. Like at least not higher then 4-5%. 
---
1000 vs 1080 dps is significant but vanilla raids are so easy that it's only relevant when speedrunning.
---
That is pretty much what I was fearing, outside of Thunderfury and the niche-Edward the Odd.  
---
Guess it's 2H all the way then.. :P
---
Leveling with friends is fun and relaxing and a great way to meet new people. If you want a challenge I suggest you join a mythic guild :)
---
Hi, /u/Norkio
---
I believe that's for rogue but I don't actually know.
---
I was looking at all his videos, but the only reference to 1H was one video of him doing holy reckoning, and talking about the potential of Ironfoe and Edward the Odd, but I was not able to find a video of him actually testing it out? Is there such a video? :O
---
haha 
---
Mage can poly once hunter uses scatter or intimidate, allowing mage to escape 
---
Hunter has no interrupt
---
Mage can iceblock beastial wrath
---
Hunter has dead zone where cannot shoot or melee
---
I’m surprised you guys have consensus that hunter owns mage. Mage can put up a pretty good fight and all it takes is running away then juking back with a blink and frost nova. And if mage is losing, can poly and run. Iceblock, blink, Nova, coldsnap, iceblock and you can nearly drain the full clock on bestial wrath too.
---
IMO, if both players are good, it’s a 50/50. And mage just gets better with gear at 69
---
I mean it's significant if you want to clear content faster in general. You don't have to go full on speedrun for an 8% dps-increase to make a difference. Since they are so easy most players would rather get it over quicker than slog through them in 6 hours or whatever like a lot of us did back in vanilla. If nothing else that 8% means you can slack off more with dps consumables. Also, the easier the raid, the more people tend to look at dps meters. If a boss is mechanically difficult you don't really give a fuck, it's all about execution. But when you are essentially on farm-mode dps matters a lot more. 
---
I would join you with pleasure just to do old content again but I don‘t want to resub and support Blizz for the mess they did with BfA😅
---
I was 19 on Feb 11, 2005.
---
Or sustain.
---
When levelling I found biggest mage counter to be shadow priest. Those fucking dicks always manage to put out solid DPS while also blocking/absorbing a fuckton of damage.
---
Spriest or a good lock were always my bane.
---
But come on now... Frostbolt is not the same damage as Pyro and the PoM on the arcane side is going to cost points that would be better spent in frost
---
The main source I was thinking of was some guy doing calculations on some post in this subreddit actually. But I remember I wasn't terribly confident in his total percentage number, because there was a lot of factors in that calculation that he didn't show in his post. 
---
You talkin about retail, mate
---
I'm not going to argue that 8% more damage wont make things easier. I'm just saying for those who dont give a shit about getting out of a raid 5 mins quicker, to play a race they enjoy.
---
Great writeup man, good info here. Thanks
---
It could be dispelled? It's been too many years since I was there
---
(( Why not just play on a private server?? ))
---
I don't like his content either, MadSeason got us all covered imho.
---
 But I think he genuinely loves classic and also he organised that tournament during the demo and so on. I don't like to see the community bashing people who do work for our community. He's a top lad :)
---
you need some programming skills, the language the addons are written in is LUA, a pretty potent scripting environment written in C. Knowing at least the basics like string handling, tables etc is vital. If you know that stuff already start with the API of the current retail client, but the classic API will probably look different as it will be more restricted than what you can do in retail
---
worst: aged gorilla whatever in STV, less than 1% drop chance from any ape in STV

Cover the AB questions in this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/anvt4x/ab_wins_to_friendly_honored_revered_and_exalted
---
&gt; you should be beating rogues 90% of the time
---
Agreed. As someone who has mained both and done a lot of 1v1 pvp of each, I’ve found it takes a great rogue to consistently beat an average mage. 
---
&gt; they should play a race they enjoy.
---
They should do that no matter what. But for some people playing a race that has significantly lower dps than the "optimal" one might not be enjoyable either. We should not be trying to hide the truth about these things just to get people to pick "what they want". 
---
Honestly, if they want to increase the difficulty to a level at which is meaningful, they should make it an Iron Man challenge/project 60 mash up. 
---
On the paladin one: I wouldn't take 3/5 BoM while leveling. The benefit is so marginal, you won't notice anything of it. I will level my Paladin with BoW up 99% of the time to reduce drinking time. Instead I would put those points into parry chance; parry is a great defensive option, while attacks after a parry have an increased speed too!
---
You're putting words in my mouth at this point. I literally stated it's an 8% difference. The knowledge is there. Boss fights are also like 40 seconds long mostly so I'm not lying when I say it's not that significant. Any tryhards already know to roll human. I'd say it's more beneficial to let the more casual crowd know they wont get rejected for playing a gnome warrior.
---
I love shit like this, and hope it sticks around when Classic launches (the reputation part at the end)
---
Well you were the one saying that it was only significant for speedrunning for example. 
---
I wasn't talking specifically about you with that comment anyway. Every single time someone asks about it there are tons of people coming in here with very helpful comments like "play what you want", "anyone who cares like that are an idiot anyway", and whatever. It's true that it will not stop you from progressing. But it's also true that it makes a difference, so telling people who are asking about it about that difference is kind of important. 
---
Mage has more survivability getting away from gankers
---
Druid has the stealth ability to prowl and attack in a contested zone though, so you’re going to be avoiding more fights to begin with.
---
It’s a tough call but I would say a druid.
---
The amount of times I have dodged fights by stealthing and sneaking away, or the amount of quests I’ve been able to pull off with enemy 60s around is Yuge. Stealth is big
---
get that shadow reflector x)
---
Seriously that's your post? Can we aim for a lower effort meme next time? 
---
Well, most fights in molten care last less than a minute, I guess it depends at which stage of the content. 
---
You make it sound like there is any other way to do it in vanilla. 
---
The problem with spellpower 1h is that most of the weapon damage is severely nerfed with rare exceptions. 
---
There are some 2h maces that are designed for Ret pal or Enh that drop in MC/BWL/ZG that have like, str/stam/int/sp and are relatively slow.  
---
Other than that, a high damage, slow swing 1h would be fine even if it doesn't have SP on it.  Your main purpose with a 1h build is heals and reck bombs- so the slow swinging weap would still do its job well with reck stacks.  SoR also adds a good chunk, so if you're just autoattacking it will at least cause some increasing damage over time.  
---
Or just play lights hope :P lol @retail. 
---
Idk what CPU has that that intergrated GPU but Ive played modern wow on medium/high settings with the intergrated GPU on my 6700k and it was more than fine. ITs an old ass game that is more CPU heavy than GPU so if its a modern CPU you'll be fine. Its not recommended tho
---
Make sure to pull the boss first.
---
Yup. Really no point to playing a class that can't do one of those things. Unless you like playing solo, and if that's the case then there are better games out there for that playstyle.
---
In darkshore there's a quest called "deep ocean, vast sea" - about collecting some items from two submerged ship wrecks. Doesn't sound too bad, but they are infested by murlocs. 
---
At the time mobs aggroed through the walls and would flee through the same walls and a greatly reduced breath meter (just vanilla things) and you had a complete clusterfuck. 
---
Says the guy who thinks they hired new CEO, which they didn't. Why you even reply if you don't know difference between CEO &amp; CFO. Hilarious.
---
I've honestly found that using a mouseover Polymorph on the Pet makes most Hunters waste Feign Death at long range which means they can't use it later for Traps, from here I would Poly the Hunter and simply walk into his dead zone, its pretty much over from here, all he has is Scatter into nothing and Intimidation which you still have Blink for.
---
Why the fuck do people take a screenshot of them taking a picture on their phone...

Thank you very much! This should help a lot :)

High school was wild. I think perhaps 1/4 or 1/3 of everyone at school played WoW during the golden era. At least half the boys, and several girls. By the time WotLK came out there were 15 people in my class of 18 who played the game. 
---
Apparently this is also the case with Fortnite these days, with a lot more girls playing games than before. 
---
Yeah, darn near a fill 25% of the video length is intro.
---
&gt; Pretty sure you are just a troll.
---
That's pretty funny coming from someone who refuse to provide even a single argument as to why Warrior PvP is more important than Hunter PvP after being requested to do so. We have already established that both classes require good two handed weapons to PvP effectively.
---
At this point I seriously doubt you will though considering you think the number of downvotes in any way shape or form is a good indication for who is right, but I will give it one last chance and allow you to show that you are a person that can be reasoned with and who can use their intellect to form actual arguments in favor of your viewpoint.
---
&gt; The weapon make a bugger difference for the warriors. 
---
Why? When both Hunter's and Warriors absolutely need a good twohander to effectively PvP, and neither class receive any PvE benefit from the twohanders, what is the actually reasoning behind why the Warrior should get priority over the Hunter?
---
virgin druid vs chad paladin
---
I think Swiftthistle does grow under water btw in its own?
---
Perfect timing, months away from Blizzard's Classic. 
---
Engineering is great but expensive and hard to level. And doesn't have too many great uses outside pvp. But it's cool.
---
You'll be fine
---
No news which is beginning to annoy the community now tbh. We want to book time off work to play...
---
Swiftthistle is easy enough tho. Even though it's not its own spawn, it's what, 1-3 drops from 2 different herbs half the time? And since only 1 is needed for tea, an hour farming can set you for a couple weeks. Low areas aren't farmed as much, except to get this and sell to rogues, so it's usually pricey.
---
I somehow managed it as a solo warrior on a PvP server but I have no recollection of how. Probably at 5am.
---
I made so much money farming those. 
---
I think it depends on the server type, but generally I agree with you. 
---
PVE minmaxing is most relevant for alliance (gnome casters, human melee, dwarf priests), whereas PVP minmaxing is much more prominent for horde (orc stun resist, undead WOTF).

Learher on troll is not really good imo, cloth on the other hand is top notch. Male Troll mage is my favorite class race combo in game, maybe female orc warrior comes close as well.

Human Paladin

Nelf Hunter

Undead Rogue

Those are the most common races, anyway.

Yeah

Some people on this sub really need to get laid.. overreactions because the already-confirmed season is not mentioned with the year once?
---
If any Warrior reading this is a bit wary I have a tip for ya. 
---
Go tank when you hit 60. You can form the group to your liking, and farm the stuff YOU want at your leisure. You could even take it a bit farther and be a dick and reserve shit like Dal'rends if you find a the right group for it. 
---
Theres a lot more to warrior frustrations like farming materials for Pre Raid BiS and the time it takes to level but as a warrior gear farming and competing with melee DPS for your DPS set is rather easy if you do your own tanking and be smart about your groups. 
---
I have a level 60 "twink" (never finished gearing him) that I made way back in TBC, I'm tempted to transfer him here but I suppose that's cheating. Maybe I'll remake him there!
---
They couldn't stream it.
---
Chinese gold farming websites HATE him!
---
Favorite for me is the Legend of Stalvan. Great storytelling of a rather 'normal' stories in the game while at the same time being one of the most evil and one that humans can relate to imo. I love that it takes you everywhere and you learn it piece by piece. 
---
I hate the winterspring quest 'Shy-Rotam'. You gotta farm some meat from frostsabers but it takes forever. Then if unprepared you get your ass wooped by a couple of elite cats. 
---
I've always wondered if you could multibox with a warlock at each side. Summon back to egg, summon to tanaris repeat. Get mad greens? I always found there is a TON of eggs.
---
I really like this serie, please keep the videos coming. 
---
I enjoy westfall because its a small zone. You pick up all the quests and boom you got most of them done by following the main story, just gotta remember to save some vendorable stuff like giblets or orka or whatever. 
---
Plus its when you start getting your first greens and of course deadmines loot. Which for humans is pretty much insane (almost all of them are warriors, rogues and paladins so they get some great loot).
---
I get your pushing the narrative to more restructuring but it's not that simple. if those jobs we're redundant, of course remove those positions but I highly doubt that was the case. I'm pretty sure with a record breaking year redundant jobs seems unlikely the culprit. To begin with we need those CMs and less vapid mobile games. You're still missing the point that most corporations in America choose short-term profits over employees. Look at the mess we've been in for the past 3 decades. Rarely are jobs secure. Millennial have to continuously jump from job to job because companies will screw them over every chance possible. There is no loyalty to the employee. Cut benefits, they work for under a living wage. Hell even Blizzards guilty of that. It's a sad. If the government doesn't force safety standards on companies or mandate minimums wages(which has stagnated since the 1970s). Most companies will gladly screw of their employees to save a few bucks. This greed in America isn't sustainable. The wealth income inequality gap isn't sustainable. It's morally reprehensible.
---
we need a healthy blend of both Capitalism and Socialism bruh Unless you're blind, you can see Americans are struggling pretty damn bad right now. All because Capitalism &amp; corrupt Politicians have turned their back on the American people for the past 3 decades.
---
- step 1: download retail
---
- step 2: does retail run 50-60fps?
---
- step 3: there is no step 3
---
It reduces damage done by glancing, but according to the vanilla wikia and unlike what pservers have. You could never fully reduce the damage reduction for glancing blows. So is it big? Yes. Is it the end all be all? No.
---
Vanilla isn't just raiding.
---
In fact most of it is content other than raiding. The best warriors I know roll gnome or dwarf because they understand that, in the content that is actually competitive from time to time (PvP) those racials make a larger difference than weapon skill does in content that isn't challenging to experienced players.
---
Wait why not ive been streaming on private
---
Bannable
---
From what
---
I think this is in the wrong subreddit
---
I'm  thinking to buy this APU just for classic. I don't  play retail or other games.
---
twitch
---
What if your doing it in character as a transformative work
---
Back in the old days it was not friendly. Nowadays people can get to 60 fast and know how to get gold and gear up.  It's not impossible or difficult. 
---
It doesn't matter how you're doing it, streaming gameplay from private servers is a bannable offense on twitch
---
Jeeze thats gay
---
Druid + Warlock or Shaman + Warlock. I still need to choose between Druid or Shaman. But my decision will be based purely on what I want and like to play and not on what would make the better combo. :)
---
Loved the video. I cant wait for more Lore vids!
---
I hope they have fun, and I'm glad Ythisens is still able to enjoy the game despite the tough situation he's just been through with the company.
---
&gt;
---
Inscription and Archaeology and ENGARNOSING are NOT allowed.
---
Is ENGARNOSING jewelcrafting?
---
The be fair, Vanilla private server mages do the same thing you explained in the last paragraph. 
---
Private.
---
Lol.
---
Classic is running on the retail engine, hence the suggestion. 
---
You are wrong. There are no 40 ppl raids in retail.
---
to TS: 2400g will be enough.
---
There will be RP servers, the entire fantasy genre was built on the backs of roleplayers and having a sense of immersion.  You shouldn't be worried.
---
Hey look it’s that guy with the top most upvoted posts of all time.
---
Actually Classic runs in the Legion's core.
---
That’s basically the same thing as BFA core. If you think they will not be updating, and continuing to update the game to run off the same core as whatever current retail is from launch onward, then I question your reasoning skills.
---
Thank you for the advice, I'll think about it more.
---
Irrelevant even for raids.
---
Racials are much more noticeable in pvp. 
---
I think you're onto something there. In both guilds I was in during vanilla, the leaders and officers tended to be the older people, even though the members ranged a lot in age. Some of the kids were good players but didn't have control over their schedule (i.e. parent aggro) or lacked the attention span to play long-term and would come and go a lot.
---
Hunters are absolute slayers when it comes to just running around killing people in World PvP or random BG’s.
---
Rogues are a great choice if you’re playing solo and want to be able to pick your battles.
---
Mages &amp; Warlocks also both very strong all-around classes in PvP. And Shadow Priests are the kings of 1v1.
---
Haha, yeah. I was college age at the time, and there were some kids who said they were in college too but we could tell they were in high school or even younger.
---
I played on the same server through Wrath, and once I was in a group with a guy I'd raided with in vanilla and he mentioned turning 18. I was like dude, you've been saying you were 18 since Molten Core. He laughed and admitted he lied about his age back then because he didn't want people to look down on him.
---
I don't have any information about updates in a future like you. But in this moment the game uses Legion's core not BfA. As a casual users, not a Blizz technical employee, we can't be sure if there are any diference between Legion's and BfA's cores. 
---
This is why you can't compare actual WoW client and Classic WoW.
---
I think raids were fairly balanced but Alliance had more players overall due to “pretty” looking characters.
---
I could be wrong about the raid balance though it’s just my guess from what I remember.
---
It is possible to criticize and also enjoy someone’s content, that’s called constructive criticism. I don’t see any bashing from anyone’s comments.
---
Nathrezim  was my primary server. I was an undead disc priest named Tsuri in the guild &lt;Mephitic&gt;. We were one of those first guilds to start getting into Molten Core. After we finally downed Rag we tried BWL and it was as bad as expected. Most of our members just didn't have what it took to raid and we fell apart.
---
I totally remember Lanfear. I wonder if any of you also remember Bove or Hatrix. We all got bored and just started ninjalootng pubs and trolling chat a lot. I remember getting a group together with her and all of us and going into Scholomance. We would go down the stairs and on the first bridge, one of us would shoot or wand at mobs way down below. They would path through half the instance nearly and pick up every mob along the way. I don't know why we did this. It was just fun to see that huge train steaming towards our group of noobs. We were the worst, and being infamous in vanilla was too fun.
---
I'm a little different now. I wonder what she's doing now. She had way too much time played. Haha.  I think I had like 86 days /played in vanilla. She was probably over a year or something along those lines.
---
Northrend was still the best designed continent.
---
NE hunters are the minmaxed class/race for PvE.
---
This is standard big business practice. You find a company with amazing brand loyalty (aka blizzard and its fans). You acquire or merge with said company and start chipoing away at its costs, delivering worse and worse products while leveraging that brand loyalty in the short term. Eventually the loyalty is not enough to overcome the massive cuts and restructuring designed to milk consumers for every penny while giving them as little as possible and the business goes into decline and fades from the titan it once was.
---
Nobody reserves loot that low. The kind of people that do that don’t find groups.
---
Both factions are going to give you a good experience if you are interested in all activities.
---
It is true that horde have an advantage in PvP because of their racial abilities but you're not going to be decimated into Oblivion simply because the undead used his will of the forsaken on you.
---
An Orc resisting key stuns though is a tide Turner for sure and could cost you a matchup but honestly if you're worried about that 10% and it ruins the experience for you I would certainly go Horde if you want to PvP.
---
In PvE 
---
It's extremely balanced
---
Minmaxers will tell you that Alliance is slightly better because of blessings, fear ward and sword spec on rogues somewhat outweigh windfury, totems and bloodfury/berserking.
---
But really, it makes little to no difference unless speed running raids while overgeared is your only priority in life 
---
In PvP, yeah hardiness/wotf is OP
---
In summary, play what you like, the class that you think is the most fun, and the race that you connect the most with
---
no, liking men is gay. 
---
ye-ye, we got it. Current map sucks, vanilla was a way to go. 
---
Got anything new for this thread?
---
They’ve made statements that the classic servers will be a realm option like every other server for retail, so yes, you can make logical assumptions based on that information that the retail client will be the same as the classic one.
---
You’re thinking of stranglekelp
---
PB&amp;J
---
I used to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE to use DI on someone in AV.  It was my favorite thing.
---
Engine is retail, ok. But consider much simpler graphics in classic. No modern shadows, water effects. ..etc
---
With only half the karma of that post 🤔
---
this is also bannable from twitch
---
8%??? It’s 4-5 based on your rng.
---
not sure why they allow non-vanilla race/class combinations. if im going to go through all this trouble to make it as authentically nostalgic as possible, would i really want to see cow priests and nelf mages in my raid?
---
Only if you use it as a slur. Im using the definition thats like a general expletive
---
If yoo do all 3 chicken escort you get a huge bonus in exp like 10k. Hated those quests too haha
---
[It can be done!(I hope this works)](https://youtu.be/NQvkbTVvuDA) 
---
You mean how weapon skill strongly encourages one race and one/two weapon types?
---
Or are you talking about how will of the forsaken completely fucks over alliance locks?
---
That's not how storytelling works though. You shouldn't just dump out everything at once. That's why we got Illidan before Arthas and Deathwing, despite the latter two both being huge characters. We'd gotten flavors of the Zandalari before, but other storylines were also included because WoW has such an expansive universe. I can't wait for classic and a return to the style of gameplay I fell in love with. But saying that blizzard should've rolled all of the stories out at once instead of segmenting them just doesn't make sense, and it would've left the game in a state of feeling stale much sooner if we'd just gotten everything at once 
---
Sure, so the original advice stands, if it can run retail, it will run classic, but better.
---
To die a lot, meet some great people. Oh and it will take you about 3 x longer. 
---
NeEdElS 
---
Yep, Black Lotus was incredibly valuable and most importantly rare. If Black Lotus was as valuable today it would be worth at least 100k per lotus!
---
Priest with shadow dps and disc healing would be hard to beat
---
So no dps in a party? Right
---
More a less everything will be different to your retail experience, modern wow has changed so much they're basically a different game now. Have you made a decision on what class you're interested in? it'll be a bit easier to compare!
---
Yea my friends are going to be alliance because they hate zebras? (have no idea what that means) So I am thinking about being a healer/cc/support kind of character. I played as a dwarf priest in my free trial of WoW.
---
So, there's any chance that, being a repression paly, I can raid? I know palys are good for healing in raid, but as a dps?
---
Nawww we dies
---
I loved my discpriest
---
Not even remotely similar.
---
If you want all of these aspects druid might be for you.
---
It definitely is. 
---
what kind of CC do druids have?
---
Haha, used to gather up the pallies in my guild and we'd run to the Ogrimmar AH and bubble hearth.
---
Dwarf priests are highly coveted in classic, would be a good choice.   word of advice as leveling a priest in classic, use talent points for "wand specialization" and always keep a good wand on you.  its the best way to level as priest, at least solo play wise.     Other than that, take your time, be kind to everyone, and have fun!  
---
Twitch is gay. 
---
I'd argue SL lock with conflag shadowburn would be crazy hard for most anyone to best.
---
I guess that makes sense, vut it's stupid that they couldn't just stream it on something like Afreeca. 
---
I disagree about Mage, as you cant use multiple trees of magic at the same time.  I think Warlock would be much stronger, having Siphon Life, Soul Link, Ruin, Conflagrate...
---
Shamans could be gnarly with NS + Elemental Mastery... An instant guaranteed CL crit! yeesh
---
The zebras is probably referring to a quest you do as Horde at the Crossroads. 
---
Root, stun(in bear form) didnt played it myself in vanilla, but should have these + something else.
---
Druids are the most versatile class in vanilla wow
---
&gt;you cant use multiple trees of magic at the same time
---
?? you realize elementalist was one of the most popular pvp mage builds in vanilla, right?
---
sorry to point that out but I think you misspelled eastern kingdoms
---
All the support classes (druid, paladin, priest etc) would be super fun. They don't have the stacking potential that pure DPS classes would but would be ridiculously well rounded as healers. Paladins having CC and reckoning alongside holy shock and holy shield would be great. 
---
What do you mean by not being able to use multiple magic schools? In vanilla you can use any spell at any time from any tree as long as you have it learned. 
---
Yeah I realize that.  That build mostly utilizes Scorch instead of Fireball from fire.  Yeah, it would probably be strong AF idk.  Blast Wave, Combustion, AP, PoM, Pyro.. plus the defense of Ice Barrier and Ice Block..
---
Ok yeah it would be sick
---
Pretty sure rogue would be completely busted, all 3 specs have moreless the same purpose of dealing damage and they would have so many things at their disposal. Same thing with mages and warlocks
---
Paladin. Repentance with reckoning and incredible healing would be impossible to beat one on one. 
---
Warlock would probably be second. SL with ruin and siphon life would be tough. 
---
Probably shaman third. Just hop over to casting or healing while stormstrike is on CD. 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure all pvp mage builds use spells from the different trees, right? Depending on the situation. What do you mean they *cant* use multiple trees of magic?
---
My thinking was while you cast frostbolt, you don't benefit from all those fire talents, and vice versa for fire spells. Idk man, maybe it would wreck face!
---
Which is a way of turning it into a slur, which is a bannable offense.
---
warlock, mage, rogue come to mind
---
SL/Conflag
---
 POM/AP/Pyro+Blast Wave while still having ice block and ice barrier? wtf
---
CB/Prep with adrenaline rush, blade flurry, and sword spec? fuck no. add in improved kick, undispellable poisons, CP generation like crazy... yeah, rogues for sure.
---
&gt; SL with ruin and siphon life + dark pact would be tough.
---
Curious why dark pact was mentioned over Conflag or even shadowburn.  Pretty lame 31pt talent overall
---
I have absolutely bubble hearthed when getting 2-3 man jumped.
---
Putting Arcane Power and PoM on elemental mage as it is would make it fucking hilarious so I'm on board with that.
---
You use frost spells for control and fire spells for pure damage, and it depends on where you are in the fight when you'll use either. It's true that piercing ice wont help out your fire spells but there are cases for every class in this situation. And every single talent-spell is going to be used by mages in PvP.
---
25%
---
19 hunter as soon as the game is out. Later on 29 pally for healing, 39 lock, and level the hunter to max.
---
You can get some really OP shit out of the gate considering there will be no higher level players to gank. STV will have no higher levels to stop you from getting agm for example.
---
Leveling herbalism and getting the AGM basically make you untouchable when combined with dungeon blues. I’ve done it on server launches before and it’s crazy fun to be able to 7 vs 1 people till twinking gets more up.
---
I want to go NA Horde most likely.
---
They aren't good, but that doesn't mean you won't be able to. It's quite possible for 30 people to complete MC/BWL if they know what they're doing. The other 10 people could be lvl 58 naked warriors if they wanted.
---
Yes, thank you. 
---
Bit of an odd hatred! They're probably referring to The Barrens, as you spend about level 12-22 there and it's full of zebras.
---
Dwarf priest is a good choice for supporting, you'll be valued endgame for your racial ability called Fear Ward! I'll try to list some of the differences for you, It might sound confusing/convoluted but I promise it's not!
---
1. Leveling in Classic will take you much longer, especially as you'll be unfamiliar with all the quests! A later expansion changed the questing areas to how you experienced them. You'll also have no guidance on your map, so you'll have to read your quest log to find what you're looking for!
---
2. As a priest you'll be spending most of your time using a wand in your ranged slot and throwing out an occasional shadow word pain. Mana drains quite fast in Classic and you'll have to learn to manage it accordingly! I recommend leveling with one of your friends!
---
3. Specializations are quite different, you wont just click shadow and gain a bunch of shadow abilities. you'll get a talent tree that [looks like this] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#b) Starting from level ten you'll get a point to spend for every level you go up.
---
If you have any specific questions feel free to ask! 
---
Most infamous if anything
---
You most certainly can kill a good hunter by abusing their dead zone.
---
I know it's asking for too much and will probably not happen in the vast majority of cases. The sad fact how both men and women conspire with their shortcomings to hamstring women in the workplace. At least it's easier to encourage good behavior in physical spaces.
---
All that being said, the guild I'm in (on pserver) is very goal-oriented, there are many females many of which I've only found out as female incidentally. The best healer I've ever witnessed in years and years of Vanilla is a female. People are respectful and don't flirt or have those sorts of dynamics.
---
But something I've come to realize is pserver populations are nothing like how Classic will be. The vast majority of pserver players are knowledgeable and have an extreme love for Vanilla. The creme of the crop.
---
Classic will be full of retail people, noobs, etc. Could be interesting. 
---
31/5/15 - something like this http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LchxdAio0zVZxfzoh
---
Shadowform + Power Infusion :)
---
Lol. 
---
Don’t get too high on that horse, buddy. I’ve been playing private servers for the last four years and played during retail Vanilla. It’s the same shit if you actually know what you’re doing. 
---
Interesting, thank you!
---
Tkx dude
---
A raid ideally wants 8 resto shamans, and about 4 or so priests. Shamans will be popular but are one the most needed classes in raids still, especially if you're willing to go resto. You really won't have trouble as a holy priest either, but resto shaman is probably the #1 demand spec at 60.
---
Seduce soulfire.
---
You should name your first characters Dunning Kruger.
---
The Tauren racial is a bit of a noob trap. Lots of people are going to think that tauren must be the de facto best tank of the faction because of the health bonus, or that the war stomp racial outweighs hardiness or WotF which it doesn't.
---
On private servers you see lots of new tanks rolling tauren because they overestimate the value of having a bit of extra health.
---
This subreddit doesn't like any logic that supports wow outside of vanilla. Don't get me wrong I fucking love vanilla but sometimes this community is pepega to the max 
---
Druid would be fun - not because it would become overpowered (although all the healing talents + deep into balance &amp; feral would up the heals a lot) but because you really could do everything.
---
Mind you, the inventory space for all that gear . . .
---
Awesome response, my dude.  The versatility of 31/20 seems really good to me.  Seems like it would be amazing for five mans, decent for solo and passable for raiding.  
---
Damn so lucky to have friends that play Classic and even invited you to play with them..
---
Have a good one buddy !
---
Alrighty, make a youtube vid of you playing a 1x server and getting to 60 solo in under 2 days played without dying once. Because that would be completely effortless doing 'project 60'. Succeed and I'll put $5,000 USD in paypal of your choice. Have fun.
---
LOL
---
Used to know all the spawn points in winterspring. Black lotus paid for my epic mount
---
I’m not taking about level speed. I’m talking about your ability to group mobs and kill them all easily. You can do that on retail and you can do that in Vanilla. 
---
Northrend was awesome. So are the dranei and belf starting zones
---
Except making a guild for Classic, Project 60 in retail WoW are basically stupid. There isn't even one thing in common between leveling a character on Retail and Vanilla and also between a lvl 60 in Retail and Vanilla.
---
Different skill set, different talents, different leveling speed, different...everything.
---
Waste of time.
---
Dwarf priest will never have to worry about missing an Ony lockout, and some pug leaders will even pay you to come if you don't run it with guild.
---
Might be time to mess with you're Reddit setting instead of complaining about something I can't change.
---
&gt;So is true that in vanilla alliance was very raid focused while horde was more towards pvp due to the racial advantages overall?  
---
This can't be true in Vanilla. In pservers of course yes. In vanilla, most people that joined had no clue of anything. You just wanted to play (and tbh, most Classic players will be the same). As a noob you didn't look at your racial. And I don't think many changed main race/class because of some balance facts.
---
You can always try playing on a private server, that might give you some idea of what to expect. 
---
pls don't photoshop ever again
---
I think Hunter would be completely broken, but you would still get nuked down by Mage. So probably Mage with all CDs up just because you get double IB with Arcane Power and PoM Pyro.
---
Skullforge reaver and deathbringer are two really good 1 handers for holy reckoning.
---
Warlock would be pants on head retarded. Not only would they get god tier tankiness from the demo tree plus the extra damage output on the pet, they also get the sustain from the affliction tree plus some really potent burst from the destruction tree.
---
I don't see how any class with just 51 talent points could beat a Warlock with 164 talent points. They'd be like a dungeon boss relative to everybody else.
---
Wish there was an EU equivalent and I’d joint, hf y’all!
---
I fuckin love classic wow (have been playing private servers for years now) but even I have to say that WotLK were some of the golden years of WoW. The original Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor have a wonderful rustic charm to them (as well as having surprising depth) but the Northrend zones were concentrated, curated, and had a good number of quests.
---
It's not that the classic zones were *bad*, but having played many many hours of 1.12 over the last few years, there are some glaring holes in content. I mean, Azshara? Stonetalon Mountains? Alterac? Even the most dedicated veteran must admit there were huge content-voids in areas were there otherwise could have, should have been great stuff going on. Northrend however was a completed product upon release that had many more quests with much fewer bugs or stupid mechanics.
---
They could stream it on Youtube.
---
Yeah, best is to wait for more news from blizzard.  
---
I agree. The talent trees aren't really stackable bonus wise, but I love the versatility of druids in PVP and being able to max their trees and really do everything would be super fun. 
---
Im going to assume this is for PvP.
---
1. Rogue; CB Prep with AR and BF? You would have so many CDs and abilities available to you it would be ridiculous. Rogues have 3 great talent trees all of which synergy well together and just give you loads of avoidance and damage.
---
2. Mage; AP POM and Combustion with all the survivability and slowing of Frost seems like it would just have an overwhelming amount of burst with a backup of survival
---
3. Warlock; Soul Link with Conflag and Shadowburn, a dream come true. Very tough to kill with very strong DoTs and burst.
---
4. Hunter; The combination of BM with Scatter Shot, Wyvern Sting and Counterattack would make a Hunter extremely tough to dead zone as well as being able to kill most opponents very fast due to BM pet.
---
5. Shaman; I think this is the lower half of the classes that would most benefit. Some hybrid gear to combine strong Stormstrikes with Elemental Mastery, NS Chain Lightenings would be a nasty combo, but i dont think it really excels beyond that.
---
6. Priest; Shadow form with extra survivability really, better heals when you shift out, but rather awkward to PvP with I would think.
---
7. Paladin; Awkward to get these trees to work together. The best way to benefit from the triple spec is to gear like a ret/holy hybrid or holy/reckoning paladin. For a ret/holy gear, you gain some nice stats and skill buffs, with Reckoning, which gives you better offense, but nothing game breaking compared to other classes. With Holy Reckoning gear, you would gain Repentence, another helpful ability, but again, nothing compared to the other classes.
---
8. Warrior; Youre very simply going to be too rage capped to use most of the abilities you gain. You basically gain a bunch of nice stats and situational abilties, but you cant really make use of them most of the time. The real ability you win with this spec is Conc blow, which is amazing, but not much else
---
9. Druid; Yea, pretty simple that none of these trees really work together at all. Cat and Bear gain almost nothing while caster/Moonkin gets some healing flexibility. As a healer, you would be a lot tankier with a better bear form and better at evading enemies, but nothing substantial. 
---
I didn't say high competition for gear but for a raid slot, as both classes are very niche and overcrowded in comparison to their relative end-game popularity. To the contrary, it is fairly easy to get funneled gear as a hunter or a druid since you're competing with 1-3 other players if you're in a static roster.
---
So much misinformation in this thread. Holy reckoning is a great solo pvp spec, and can also put out decent heals in pve. You're not gonna be the best premade healer, but for pugs it's great. T1 allows you to be pretty tanky and stack a decent amount of int. Once you get T2 with spellpower it gets really good. (Lightforge until then) Try getting your hands on a skullforge reaver or deathbringer, enchant with lifestealing (fiery if you're broke). Maelstrom trinket is really good, hoj is decent, the fire dmg trinket from lbrs (I think, correct me if I'm wrong) is also really good. Blazefury medallion doesn't scale with sp based off the current info we have.
---
Idk why people are mentioning seal of command, you're never going to use it with a 1h build. Seal of righteousness is gonna be your go to. With frost or shadow oil, your 5 stack reckbombs are gonna proc for alot.
---
Best way to play this in BGs is to be a healer/support until you can build up reckoning stacks, and then unload on an unsuspecting clothy or flag carrier.
---
You can also play holy reckoning with a 2hander and it's arguably better. It's my favorite spec hands down, give it a shot.

Wrath was massively hated by the Vanilla and TBC crowd due to the change in the raid tier structure, and daily quests. Northrend was however comfy zones, and really well designed quests and storylines.
---
I loved the og map. Best Music and theme was in northrend though. Grizzly Hills. My favorite zone in classic was probably WPL. Either that or Ashenvale. 
---
Probably rogue. None of the specs are mutually exclusive and all contribute to 'do more damage, CC more dudes, and don't die'. 
---
Shaman? Stormstrike, NS and Elemental Mastery would be pretty insane.
---
Shaman and frost shock is more iconic.
---
Don't @ me. 
---
Countet strike have s battle Royal. You filthy casual.
---
???????
---
Mage would be godmode and just delete people, after that would be rogue and hunter.
---
Classes with all 3 talent trees buffing their baseline abilities do the best.  There is a gigantic tax on classes that use different stats(hybrids), spells(warlock/priest), or weapons(warrior/paladin) for different specs.  
---
Warrior -  Main gain would be deathwish added to arms for extra damage.   Lot of wasted talents on weapon specs in arms and almost all of prot is a waste.   Overall stronger, but class would suffer same weaknesses
---
Paladin - Reckoning and increased heals would be nice for whats basically still a ret paladin, but you would gain nothing from the shield related prot talents and you wouldn't have the spell power or mana to fully benefit from the increased healing output
---
Druid - Similar to paladin you wouldn't be able to gear properly to take advantage of either the balance or feral talents.  Deep balance+resto alone isn't very strong.
---
Rogue - For sure best melee. You would melt things with Prep AR coldblood on top of an already strong class.
---
Shaman - A little interesting, since baseline damage of your abilities is quite high you don't need a ton of spell power.  So take enhancment, give x2 critmod on spells, add mana tide to counter having low int, and NS to either heal or add more burst.  Would be extremely bursty, but be limited to playing as 2h enhance, so very easy to kill.  If you geared as a caster, deep enhance adds no benefit other then the debuff from stormstrike.  
---
Hunter - Initially this didn't seem that strong in my head, then I realized this might be quite good.  Intim, scatter, and wyvern gives you crazy single target control.  All three trees have very strong end of tree passive stat boosts that would be beneficial together, and the damage output from a stat-buffed marks hunter with beastial wrath up would be insane.  I am not sure which would be stronger between this and rogue.  
---
Priest - Disc/shadow hybrid was already a thing in dueling specs in vanilla and was very good, but the deep holy talents are quite bad and most only adds a bit of healing.  It is hard to properly gear a balance of +healing and +damage to make this super great in a infinite talent point meta.  
---
Mage - AP combustion pyro mage would instant kill any non-stealth non-immunity class on the opener. Even when someone survived that opener, you would still have shatter-combing, full damage scorch mage with imp CS and double block.  This would be highest survival, highest opening burst, with a very strong sustained damage followup, on a class with extremely strong base control.  
---
Warlock - There are a ton of demo talents that are a waste, and deep destro and deep affliction don't boost each other a ton.  There isn't much added damage from weaving shadow and fire abilities. 
---
Gotcha. That makes sense!
---
It also greatly invalidates a lot of the raid drops. Imagine every warrior crafting Titanic leggings before even stepping into a raid. Those are not replaced until the Naxx legs, and even those are not really a direct upgrade.
---
SM/Ruin with DS would be so broken for PvE dps. Then you got SM/Conflag AND SL in PvP? Yeah gimme warlock
---
Warrior would be nuts too, insane in all 3 major roles (tanking, PvE dps, PvP)
---
That's why you carry a Hand of Edward the Odd so that you can use the proc to heathstone instantly.
---
The only reason that they weren't camped in 2004-2006 was because the general population was bad at the game, and didn't have the knowledge that Lotus had value. I use 'bad at the game' in context compared to 2019 Classic WoW gameplay. 2005 players are not as good as 2019 players. 
---
Spawns will be camped on every Classic server with at least a semi-hardcore guild. Expect to have severe competition (maybe even right click report spam bans) on servers with multiple hardcore guilds. 
---
Yes, because players would try leveling solo 1-60 if they knew that dying meant they also died IRL..
---
General rule of thumb is 8 to 10 days played to hit 60.  Obviously it can be fine faster or slower and friends on class but outs the best estimate. 
---
&gt;You can't even hemo without wiping out important raid debuffs
---
Not really true, but ok. Vanilla use a debuff priority system, which means some debuffs always take precedent over other debuffs. Hemo is considered a medium priority debuff and will never replace Taunt, Faerie Fire, Sunder Armor, Warlock curses, Judgement etc.
---
It will however replace Ignite, Corruption, Moonfire, etc.
---
With pom, combustion, x2novas for shatter, blastwave, improved fireblast, and improved coc, mage would be so OP that it would kill almost everything without ever having to hard cast.  
---
This x100 when leveling a Priest! Always keep your wand up to date. At level 24 or so, get your ass to Blackfathom Deeps, grab https://www.wowhead.com/quest=1200/blackfathom-villainy and C H E R I S H Gravestone Scepter. Excellent Wand!
---
Vanilla aoe farming requires a little skill though, they were talking about aoeing mobs while some of them are hitting you.
---
As someone who has played a lot, I get to 20 in around 20-24 hours of played time (not speedrunning). As a new person, you’re probably looking at 30-36 hours unless you get a lot of help. Plus the content is more challenging and immersive with a less linear and flashy leveling system.
---
How does that compute? 
---
Yeah it's a shame, since thematically it would be nice to see those big goofy cows more often on the frontlines. 
---
My vanilla character was a Tauren Shaman, and while I overall regretted not being an orc towards the end, warstomp saved my life more than a few memorable times, it was a nice stun that made Elemental PVP feel much more survivable. 
---
It's not irrelevant. Weapon skill has a major impact on DPS.
---
Northrend did nothing wrong
---
**Current WoW is like life in a thriving big city.** There's so much to do! Your reputation doesn't matter, as most people don't know or care who you are. You have your guild and your friends, and there's always the booty-call of LFR. Half the players more gold than they can spend and the other half can't afford repairs raid to raid. 
---
**Classic WoW is like life in a vibrant small town.** The game is paced more slowly. You level slowly, but each gain is meaningful. (you get a talent point to spend every level!) Dungeons require CC and you really need to take it one pull at a time. Your town won't be filled with strangers; you'll know these other players, or at least know of them. Your reputation with the server will largely define the borders of how much fun you can have.
---
Imo you can expect a less mature community overall. Alliance always seemed to be more team players tho whereas horde were more tryhard 1 man army types. Some subtle differences in bg mentality.
---
&gt;Not counting the 3% hit gain
---
Once you include this and start to consider that you are able to use other pieces of gear instead of needing the hit, the difference becomes quite a lot higher than 3-4%.
---
he talked about nearly every possible weapon out there for pallies. I know he tested Foe and Odd on ptr but cant find the exact stream video.
---
This min-maxing argument is overblown for pservers. Actually there is much more diversity than you might think.
---
When I see ally priests there are still a ton of non-dwarf ones even though dwarf priests are objectively better. From a min-maxing perspective dwarf priests heavily outweights the other racials.
---
On horde, troll priests are on par or better than undead priests, still there are many more undead priests than troll ones.
---
Vast majority of horde rogues still seem to be undead, even though trolls are objectively better in PvE and Orcs in PvP. Same goes for undead warlocks, orcs are objectively better for PvP but you see much more undead. Definitely a flavor thing going on here.
---
If you think CMs were reason they had record profits you're a fucking mad man.
---
Never got the point of this unless you actually like modern because that's exactly what you're getting, level 60 capped modern WoW.
---
Crit dont push miss of the table afaik. So if 40% of attacks glance, 20% miss, and you have 40% crit chance, adding another point of crit wont do anything unless you first add another point of hit.
---
Cause nobody uses it.
---
&gt;Tried hemo spec raiding when I was a rogue noob on Nost
---
Just a question but why would you pick a PvP spec when trialing for a guild?
---
That number is for non new players I think, during vanilla I only managed to get 53 on my rogue before bc came out and I had 24 days played. I am leveling a priest on a 1x private server currently and I'm at 8 days played and level 55. Easy for people to get side tracked when you're new 
---
That's a good point that I didn't mention.   Thank you
---
alliance is significantly better in both pve and pvp, u cant even compare orc and ud racial to having paladins....
---
But even with that the reason classic wow is "balanced" is because there are so many things you can do as a player to "overcome" not having a paladin on horde.  Basically there is a large skill gap in the game, but at the very top it is extremely alliance favored 
---
Not to mention having Ice Barrier and Combustion at your disposal.
---
Now that I've put this in context of a standard elemental mage with the above tools, I'm starting to think this could be insane.
---
&gt;Druid; Yea,  pretty simple that none of these trees really work together at all. Cat  and Bear gain almost nothing while caster/Moonkin gets some healing  flexibility. As a healer, you would be a lot tankier with a better bear  form and better at evading enemies, but nothing substantial.
---
Being able to spec into every talent would buff the 29/11/11 playstyle by a lot. This already strong spec would gain much stronger heals, regen from spirit, NS, Swiftmend, better feral damage, 130% speed cat form, 20% more intellect (+ some minor stuff) - all very relevant to the playstyle. I'd probably put druid above paladin or even priest.
---
No, I want to option to have my guild all report the maintank of whoever gets the tag on the world boss to automatically trigger a ban. This will help my guild get the tag.
---
Stop, you're making me want to main mage again in classic! Was hoping to try something new (shaman warlock or hunter)
---
&gt;Some people on this sub are really that delusional and self-entitled.
---
Which is arguably better than being so stupid that you think giving players the ability to automatically trigger a ban on opposing players for whatever reason is somehow GOOD. If someone is being a toxic edgelord you can put them on ignore, and a GM will deal with them apropriately some time down the line. Players cannot be ever trusted to deal with this themselves. Especially not in a game such as classic.
---
Troll rogues are objectively better for PvE than Undead. Undead Rogues aren't top of the food chain in neither PvE nor PvP, people just pick em becaue they're cool.
---
A Warrior in PVE would be incredible, with constant stance swapping and weapon swapping. Can create an insane amount of threat, do a ton of damage, and tank pretty well.
---
One-Handed specialization + Enrage + Flurry + Sword Specialization + Impale. The damage would be too much. So much rage, so much much threat. Could anything do more damage than this?
---
In PvP it would work okay assuming you were very good at stance and weapon swapping, but it would have a high skill cap and still need help from teammates. Assuming you were very good and had that help from teammates, you would be extremely hard to deal with with the tankiness + the insane damage.
---
Hunter would have an extremely strong pet, and access to a lot more ranged damage as well as Utility. It would be quite hard to deal with in PVP.
---
I'm not saying either of these are the strongest or weakest, just felt like it'd be fun to comment on them.
---
It’s a temporary suspension, not a ban, and has not resulted in any apocalypse since being implemented. 
---
&gt;I can't begin to tell you how many players on private servers flood chat with “jokes” against black people and mexicans. “We're just trolling, bro, why you gotta be such a snowflake? I have a black friend who says it's okay!”
---
If people act this way in Classic they will get dealth with by Blizzard. You need to grow some thicker skin if you cant handle having to wait a couple hours for a GM to look over the report and deal with this player.
---
The reason you see this behaviour on private servers is because nobody really care to moderate it.
---
Where did you find that fucked up top map.
---
First time I ever seen Pandaria that close to Kalimdor 
---
I disagree. I don’t think it’s the best way to get the higher ups to change, but being a customer of course gives you a right.
---
That’s assuming your guild funnels all the MC mats to you.  
---
I wish there was a right click report function on reddit so I could have everyone I know report you and autobanning you. Not because you did anything wrong, but just because I dont like you and that the system would allow me to make things difficult for you.
---
Because that is essentially the system you folks defend for classic. The ability to temporarily ban anyone for any reason (Everything from getting the tag on the mob you wanted, or someone outdps'ing you in a raid, or another guild fighting you for a world boss)
---
Daily quests existed in tbc, though. 
---
Definitely agree. Grizzly Hills is still my favourite zone to this day, and I've played all expansions. 
---
Wotlk was fucking good, holy shit how I miss that expansion. 
---
Now excuse me, I have to listen to Grizzly Hills music again.
---
Aspect of the zevra:
---
You have stripes
---
Sure, and if you did that I’d file a claim, it’d be investigated by a GM and you and everyone you got involved would be suspended and my account would be reinstated. 
---
You do realize that this has been tested already, right? Asmongold’s viewers tried this and they themselves got suspended for making false reports. 
---
&gt;deep destro and deep affliction don't boost each other a ton
---
SM/Ruin is the go to PvE dps spec
---
A friend and I are planning on making an orc warlock and troll rogue, respectively. Kind of an odd combination, but he'll get free boxes opened if nothing else.
---
That is my question. How big is that major impact, how much more dps does it mean?
---
I remember somwhere I read about 1.8% dps increase for +5 wepskill. Give  it is true it is objectively not a major impact imo, but the important thing wether guilds and raid leaders would consider it major or a deal breaker for invitation to the group.
---
If you don't have many viewers you won't get noticed by Blizzard anti fun police, it's just that if someone "bigger" streamed it they would get banned. 
---
I am perfectly aware that it is a temporary suspension. That doesnt make the result any less devastating when the Maintank of a guild gets suspended while fighting over a world boss, or someone getting suspended for a day when ranking to 14.
---
Also, you would have to be extremely naive to think players wont abuse the hell out of this system when there are such huge advantages to be gained. I am not having a low opinion about classic players at all, I am just being realistic. People suck.
---
That may be true but anyone playing a hunter will never breach top 15 on dps charts so in my experience most realize that and prefer to go dwarf for PvP racials and better looks. Most of the hunters I talk to say they wouldnt be caught dead playing a nightelf lol
---
One extra spell squeezed into a spellpower/crit cooldown is worth more than just one extra spell. Also I'm pretty sure Berzerking is off the gcd so it wouldn't waste any time popping it. 
---
Also undead mages are ugly. 
---
Sure, and if you did that I’d file a claim, it’d be investigated by a GM and you and everyone you got involved would be suspended and my account would be reinstated and future reports by you would be auto-flagged as possible trolling. 
---
You do realize that this has been tested already, right? In one instance, of many, Asmongold’s viewers tried this and they themselves got suspended for making false reports. 
---
That’s why Youtubers stopped making videos about what a horrible system it is. None of their fears came true. 
---
You’re literally making a mountain out of a molehill—a molehill that didn’t even exist in the first place. 
---
Well I guess it depends on whether you want to do pvp or not.
---
Congratulations, you got four biscuits. Well chosen.
---
No seriously. Grow thicker skin. If you get upset over seeing some written words on the screen despite knowing perfectly well that the player WILL get dealt with as soon as a GM look over your ticket, the problem is clearly with you being a crybaby.
---
Introducing a system where a group of players can come together to fuck over anyone they wish for any reason is not going to somehow make the game better.
---
GMs didn’t steal loot from ninjas. As far as the actual rules went, if you won the roll it was yours. They only moved loot if both players agreed there was a mistake and wanted it to be swapped.
---
you won't leave your starting zone in the first 15 hours
---
The system doesn’t work the way you think it does at all, that’s why it stopped being an issue a month after it was implemented. 
---
And “grow thicker skin” is not an appropriate response against racism, homophobia, and rampant white nationalism. 
---
I was only talking about time until level 20. But yeah expect for the long haul. It’s an adventure. The joy of this game is seeing the world and enjoying the experience. 
---
Not like there's much else to do with them once you're clearing BWL/AQ and all the other MC crafted gear is already done.
---
I thought it was a bit more complicated than that and depended on what gear was available, but I have found it hard to get clear numbers.
---
Find Treasure, this will now be active the rest of your life.
---
&gt;You do realize that this has been tested already, right? In one instance, of many, Asmongold’s viewers tried this and they themselves got suspended for making false reports.
---
So what? Your guild already got the tag on the world boss after reporting the opposing guild. Who cares if you get temporarily suspended when the next respawn is a week away?
---
You are just defending a broken cost saving system because you are too pathethic to handle some words written on the screen. What you are fighting for is the ability to immediately react emotionally to anything you perceive as "bad" or "offensive" instead of just putting that player on ignore and letting a professional (in this case a Game Master) handle the issue.
---
Show me where your fantasy scenario actually happened in Retail. 
---
The fact is, you’re simply wrong about the outcomes and you refuse to admit it. 
---
What’s wrong with Stonetalon? Great questing area for Horde and tbh ally shouldn’t even have a fp or town there since horde don’t get anything in the first few ally contested zones. 
---
Leveling warrior with 2H is bad.
---
Use "x"
---
Thats about my talent tree.
---
Yeah I played on Nostalrius and lotus spawn rates were abysmal but then again the server had like 4-6 times as many players as vanilla servers did. I don't recall there being as much of an issue in vanilla but they were still in demand for raiding.
---
wonderfully put.
---
&gt;School RuneScape earlier.Discussion  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Posted byu/NeverLikely1 day ago
---
8-10 is a good rule of thumb for people who have hit 60 before, but your very first 60 will likely take closer to 14-20 days. Only way I can see a newbie hitting 60 in 8 days /played is with extensive help from addons, guides, and a friend helping to push them along. My first 60 was a hunter back in Vanilla that took 18 days/ played. I've streamlined my leveling path on a private server so I'm pretty confident I can get to 60 on a priest in about 8 days without going too tryhard.
---
You are ignoring the most obvious benefit of grouping, which is that you can handle pulling a huge amount of mobs and kill them relatively quickly. Especially doing this when moving between quest areas will easily make up for each mob giving less XP.
---
The guild has to decide between selling the ingot worth up 1500g in the auction house or giving them to one person.  The 12000g worth of ingots is better served on other guild stuff.   I’ve personally never seen a guild hand over the mats to the guy going for sulfuras.  
---
I’m seeing the ingots as a 30% drop chance on one boss so that’s a whole lot more than 1-2 clears worth.
---
this will happen no matter what when beta arrives.
---
Are you saying impressive in a sarcastic way? Because it is impressive. Also you fail to notice that it would be one more spell casted on a 30s fight as well, making it much more significant on shorter fights. It would also be 2 extra spells on a 5 minutes fight instead of 1, because it's a 3 minutes cooldown, you can use it twice. 
---
Idk man, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who takes dps seriously. Scoffing at one entire extra spell during a boss fight. Might as well just walk for an entire second more than you need to get out of the fire at this point.
---
To put some numbers on the "useless" and "just one more spell" racial:
---
In a 3 minutes fight, if you play frost perfectly and have 0 downtime, you'd be able to cast (3*60)/2.5=72 frostbolts. Being able to cast 73 is a 1.4% increase in damage output. More if you combine it with other CD, making this particular extra frostbolt more significant than the off CD ones. That's the same kind of bonus you can expect from your average gear upgrade. Would you scoff at a new shiny epic bracers? Because they usually increase your dps by less than that. 
---
On a 30s fight, it becomes absolutely broken, increasing your damage by a whopping 8.3%! Again, not even taking into account CD compounding. 
---
It's a very good racial on long fight, and an absolutely insane one on short fights. 
---
I LOVE Grizzly Hills and I love that zone's music. It was one of the zones I hung out in. There, Nagrand and BlackRock Mountain...I know but sometimes a hellscape has a certain charm and it was my regular farming zone in Classic
---
all you got?
---
That's min-maxing shadow bolt DPS. The Destro kit is bigger than that
---
Yeah that's where I stopped reading.
---
&gt; and the guy responsible ended up transferring off the server, since his reputation was shattered.
---
This is why it's important to only have realm transfers in very limited scope, ie from one heavily overpopulated server to a low pop. one, otherwise no transfer allowed.
---
That's not how you deal with trimming the fat in a zerg guild that made poor recruiting decisions in the first place.
---
You promote a new GM from one of the noobs, and all of the few good players leave and start a new guild together. That way no one is kicked.
---
Fucking amateurs.
---
You can feasibly play modern wow at 60 fps outside of raids on a 2400g. I just got back from a trip where I used one the whole time, and it's a fine time.
---
This was back in 2006. Yes, we were amateurs.
---
You're not casting one extra spell into a spellpower/crit cooldown. At that point you haven't earned your extra spell cast yet, as you'd need multiple Berserkings to achieve that. So all you've achieved is an extra 30% damage with a single Frostbolt from Arcane Power, and that is by far the most significant cooldown there is. As Fire your most significant cooldown is gonna be just your trinket, as 10% haste won't be enough to allow you to achieve a 4th crit from Combustion. So as Fire you're gonna be gaining like 10% of a Fireball, if not less.
---
Also, Berserking is off the GCD yes, but popping cooldowns still wastes time, if only due to server latency.
---
I mean, roll what you want, if you enjoy Trolls then absolutely go for it. I just dislike this whole idea that berserking is actually a significant PvE racial for casters.
---
No, Kalimdor will never be beaten in any MMO ever, including some shitty expansion. The variety and depth far surpass any graphical upgrades in texture Northrend received. 
---
A minute maybe on private servers. 
---
I’d say Mage, but I’m a biased lifelong Mage player.
---
&gt;if only due to server latency.
---
What is spell queueing
---
Must have been some pretty awful guilds you were in, if they sold useful raid materials instead of letting raiders have them first.
---
Indeed. Why are you so upset by it?
---
Vanilla didn't have spell queueing for one. The assumption that this will be included in Classic is a fair one but certainly not factual. And regardless, even with spell queueing, you're just queueing your Berserking. You're still gonna need to Fireball afterwards as it's not like you can queue both.
---
I've only got one thing to say.
---
Boring Tundra.
---
What do you mean by “raid tier structure”? I never made it to raiding in Wrath.
---
Stonetalon is definitely my weakest example, but in fairness I have only leveled alliance recently.
---
But Alliance need a flight path there to reasonably connect to Nigel's Pointe, Desolace, and connect that to Feathermoon Stronghold.
---
But also there were dungeon quests that just *sucked*. Gnomeregan is exhibit 1.
---
- That first 8 slot bag you find, will actually feel like a huge UPGRADE over the 6 slot bags  
---
-  You will equip any green you find and can wear, since that +2 stamina is actually significant at lvl 12. Who cares that you don't need agility?  
---
- despite this, you still will have white items at lvl 17. (unless you got stuff from the AH)
---
You ever rolls a group with 2 warrs, 2 shamans and a priest. Such easy mode.
---
good points, I would add that it's ok to try out many classes to let's say lvl 10 or 15, because then you can make a more informed choice for your real main class.  It's also nice to try different races, so you can get a feel of the starting zones and their culture. 
---
You will have options as to which quests you do, and in what order.
---
You will not be given directional tools that require zero attention.  You'll read quest text and try to "find that grove east of ---- River."
---
Because of open design, your experience will be different than anyone else's.  It's quite pleasant to discover connections between npc's and be a part of a story that develops.
---
It will be a challenge to take on more than one mob at a time.  
---
After each fight, you'll probably have to eat and/or drink.
---
You'll want to group up regularly to overcome elites.  This will be mandatory for some quests.
---
Levelling to 60 can take months for an average player.
---
You'll probably set your hearthstone to an inn where you're questing.  It takes a LONG time to travel anywhere in Vanilla.  
---
You'll likely make a bank alt that you can mail items to put up on the AH.  
---
When you ding a new level, you'll have to see your class trainer for spells and upgraded levels of spells.  
---
You will have to see a Weapons Trainer to learn weapons skills, and will Level your use of each weapon type.
---
There is no Looking for Group function.  When you find a group of level appropriate people who want to run a dungeon with you, appreciate it.  
---
If your guild sucks, don't stick around.  
---
CLASSIC will be very challenging and grindy by today's standards.  Expect it to be raw and brutal in every way compared to retail.  But these challenges made the World a bigger thing than you are.
---
So apart from leveling being really tough as others are mentioning, some things to look out for:
---
* Shamans and Paladins are faction locked, so if any of you or your friends insist on playing one then that's your faction (Shaman = Horde, Paladin = Alliance)
---
* Class+Race combo matters a lot in some cases. If you're an Alliance priest you'll be looked at weirdly if you don't roll dwarf for example. There's plenty of resources out there for your class as to what's best.
---
* Classes have a much more defined role in raids. Warriors tank, Priests/Paladins/Shamans/Druids heal, the rest DPS. There's very little overlap, although there is some, especially as progression becomes easier. But if you want to tank, role warrior, and don't roll Paladin expecting to get many groups as Ret.
---
* Money is scarce, I'd say most players didn't have their epic 100% speed mount by the time the expansion hit.
---
* Talent trees are complex, and they get expensive to keep changing. The first few points are just as important as the last few, so research your talent choices before going in.
---
Hand of Edward the Odd+Hearthstone is much more iconic imo! People are so confused when you cast hearth and disappear instantly.
---
I never even played vanilla. I started in late tbc and I can't wait to experience classic. Must be my nostalgia goggles.
---
They should do more sharding, right click reporting, and make the game not work when more than 20 people are in the same area. That should help profits. 
---
Don’t forget pushing out expansions when they are literally in alpha state, and then ignore forum feedback about the alpha mess of the expansion.
---
The biggest differences you will see compared to BfA will probably be:
---
•  Leveling takes longer
---
•  Creatures pose a much bigger threat
---
•  There is no LFG system to automatically form dungeon groups. You must form your own or join someone's group and then actually travel to the dungeon entrance in the world.
---
•  The game is sometimes cryptic on where you need to go (no quest tracking on the map/minimap)
---
•  Gold is a scarce resource
---
•  You might need to drink/eat a lot to regenerate mana/health depending on your class (Almost entirely pointless in BfA
---
•  New spells and higher spell ranks are purchased at a class trainer compared to BfA where you automatically learn new spell.
---
That is amazing. What details in settings? What about raids or cities?
---
The 10/25 and normal/heroic splits. Previous to Wrath raids had one size and one difficulty. There's only one Kara, but there's four ICCs.
---
•  Gold is a scarce resource used for many things
---
•  You might need to drink/eat a lot to regenerate mana/health depending on your class (Almost entirely pointless in BfA).
---
• Combat is slower and spell/attack animations are less flashy and smooth looking.
---
• A laundry list of QoL improvements. Ex: A druid in a shapeshift form cannot talk to an NPC. Also you can't shapeshift from one form to another. You must exit that form and cast the desired form.
---
......the differences go on and on. While some things may sound objectively worse, the complete package is something that is far more engaging and fun imo.
---
It would still get banned if it was at all popular.

I bought a tusker sword on my warrior off the AH right before I hit 40, just because it looked cool.
---
Never done a project 60, but it looks fun. However, I logged into the server and only two people online in the guild.
---
Eugene here! Super hyped for classic. 
---
I’m not saying it matters, only that it’s true.
---
Personally, to me, the content holes were one of the things that what made the world interesting. Some areas were full of civilization and quests, while others were empty and had little real purpose. Exploring these areas (deadwind pass, northern stonetalon, etc) were a genuine adventure because it was YOUR adventure, not some blizzard quest writers adventure. Streamlining all areas, creating more of quest theme parks, was what made the world more dead to me. Quite ironic considering the world was more "filled up".
---
Don't get me wrong, I had a blast in TBC &amp; Wotlk, but that was for very different reasons. Those expansions were a great GAME, but much of the "world" in World of Warcraft died with the release of TBC.
---
I think Warlock would be the craziest. He’s getting survivability, strong dots, and strong burst. It would be insanely fun to play. Remember how broken SL/SL was in TBC, and that was with dots nerfed by resilience. 
---
Paladin with Holy Shock, Reckoning *and* all the crit and increased holy damage from ret? That would be awesome.
---
I think people also sleep on warriors. Something about increased crit on 1h and shield seems to make people think they won't deal damage, but they'll have so much utility and reduced damage that they'll kill you before you kill them
---
The biggest difference. You are incentivized to team up to overcome obstacles. Everything in retail is soloable.
---
Secret to success in WoW classic. Make friends and then make more friends.
---
They just make their own groups and dont invite anyone who will roll on it.
---
Gold is A LOT harder to come by, so you don't need to train every new spell while levelling.  Spells cost gold and the cost continually  goes up the higher level you get.  Only train what you think will be necessary and save your gold for other things like food/water and your level 40 mount and riding training.
---
Unlike current WoW, you can buy your first mount and mount training at level 40.  The training I believe was around 90-100g and the mount around 10g IIRC.
---
Source on that? I know for sure that we sat down to check crits in duels back then.
---
There's nothing boring about Borean, friend.
---
In theory, in reality it doesn't have a huge impact. I will explain it again and again. During a raid there are so many variables that happens. Especially in the later raids like AQ40 and Naxx.
---
The Weapon skills will do nothing to help you there.
---
I think it sounds fun as hell and its for sure worth trying out once you hit 60 I think :)
---
For real? Never tried reckbombing in retail vanilla only on private servers. That blows, even though it makes sense its a bit counter intuitive. RIP Warrior enrage I guess ^^ 
---
Yeah, racials don't matter much. Please play Nelf and human priests as much as you want. 
---
~~So that I could have an ez time as a dwarf priest.~~
---
You realize that without taxes corporations wouldn't be able to exist, right? Or perhaps you would prefer the an-cap paradise where no taxes exist and to protect your intellectual property you have to purchase McNukes to engage in MAD with anyone who might infringe your copyrights?
---
Im glad I read this before I dove in, thank you.
---
It isn't a threat of violence. It is a social contract. These corporations have decided to partake in our society and our market and therefore have to also partake in our rules, which include taxes. If they don't like that they can go somewhere like Somalia where they have close to no taxes and see how well their business does there.
---
EXACTLY this.
---
The one day I did it ironically during vanilla, my guild felt apart. Really.
---
Turns out there were some pretty bad tensions simmering which I was unaware of. During a guild UBRS run I thought it would be hilarious to pull a Leeroy and then bubble hearth out of it. 
---
Apparently that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
Reck bomb isn't Blizzlike tho. Reck/Enrage etc didn't proc from /sit until TBC afaik. And Holy Shock is ass without SP gear. Honestly unlimited talent points wouldn't change Paladin all that much. They would basically be the same as they are now, just with stronger heals.
---
&gt; Ignite  
---
Ignite is an important raid debuff.  It represents a sizeable amount of the damage dealt by your mages, all of whom share a single ignite.  
---
Honestly, even if it just wipes out a moonfire it is not very cool.  The hemo debuff, if fully consumed by attacks that actually add the 7 damage, represents a total of 210 pre-armor-mitigated damage.  If reapplied, this is less.  If consumed by whatever dot ticks are bugged at any given time, it is less.  
---
Hemo doesn't wipe sunder armor in all patches, but it absolutely can wipe out important debuffs in all vanilla patches.  
---
It should not be brought to a raid.
---
SPriest with PI or Warrior with MS+DW imo
---
I hope eventually after Classic comes out they release TBC and WOTLK servers that we're able to transfer to once we reach 58 and 68 but can never go back.
---
those are my least favorite starting zones 
---
In a top hardcore raiding guild  it won't matter if alliance or horde.
---
I was on the horde side raid who always got first kills. It's just a matter of how determined you and 39 people are. 
---
However as a casual raider I would go alliance all the way. The paladins and fear ward allow not so decent players to go all the way. High tier epics will be more exclusive on the horde side. 
---
Both has pros and cons. Especially when raids take breaks during the summer, alliance should have no issue getting new players. 
---
On pvp. I just think horde is straight up better racials. But alterac is heavily alliance favourit.
---
So all in all I wouldn't say alliance is better in pve and horde is for pvp. Everything in classic has a weird balance of its own. 
---
Add northrend to the bottom pic
---
And this is the glory of opinions, both sides 
---
If you played WoW for the first time last couple of days, you still haven’t played WoW.  What you played is some crap that should not exist
---
When compared to that, the bonuses are nice, but I dont find them that substantial. Of course any druid wants HotW for any spec, but its just a nice chunk of stats, while the rest of the feral tree is just wasted on DPS talents, as youll never make much use out of it without melee gear on. NS is a big buff, with some extra healing, but I stil think that nearly all the feral tree having almost no synergy with the other trees really drags Druid down.
---
Reck worked marvelously in vanilla. It would give you unlimited extra attacks until nerfed and then four. And Holy Shock is fine in Judgment gear. You’d be nearly unkillable if you wanted to heal (especially since you have two stuns) and would destroy when you had reck charges. I one shotted plenty of clothies in vanilla after a rogue kept critting me. 
---
Agree, that timeframe is for a small percentage of people. A month or so is more like it
---
shouldn't be an issue in actual Classic.  
---
Did they say if he will deal shadow dmg in the Classic release patch?
---
in any case he should have the normal ridiculous spawn time
---
I kinda want to remake the NE priest I played in retail vanilla, but I think I'll just play some other class
---
PVE:  
---
Alliance - Excels in early progression and the paladin skillset along with dwarf fear ward helps lesser skilled raids progress further.  
---
Horde - Shaman skill set evens out later and is not at much of a huge disadvantage if your raid is skilled enough and doesn't crutch on fear ward and paladin blessings early on.  
---
PVP:  
---
Alliance - The general wisdom I've always heard is that Alliance pugs are garbage, but Alliance premades are top notch  
---
Horde - I've heard the reverse in this case. Horde pugs are great, but Horde premades often get beat by Alliance premades of equal skill again due to the paladin kit.  
---
And Northrend just looks..funky
---
I think it's pretty obvious Lock is the strongest. Soul Link, Siphon Life, Nightfall, Master Demo, Fel Domination, Ruin, Conflag, Shadowburn, Shadow Mastery, Imp Drain Life. 
---
Ah sorry, going of memory here. I just don't remember them as being very prominent, mainly a few cooking quests, and one or two reputation quests. But it could be I am wrong.
---
sad
---
You actually make use of healing, offensive spells AND feral DPS when using a PvP set. 
---
Druid thrives on efficiency and effects that allow you to outlast your opponent without using up your mana. 10% more healing, 20% more intellect, 15% spirit regen, NS and 50% regrowth crit chance (combined with nature's grace!) alone are real game changers. Better mobility and more damage in feral forms seals the deal for this sort of spec.
---
Am currently leveling a druid on a private server. Level 58 with exactly 8 days played, so this estimate sounds right. Shorter times for hunters, longer times for warriors, most everyone else is middle-of-the-pack.
---
Yeah, people didn't know that flasks were good....more pserver heroes thinking they invented shit...
---
Minor speed on boots would like to have a word with you, for 3 gold of course.
---
do we have any updates on when Blizz servers are going live? All they said was in the summer of this year, is there a date yet?
---
I think someone found last week that sit stacking reck will not be in. 
---
I think the Tanaris one is technically the most difficult and time consuming.
---
Current p server I’m on favors ally heavily so as a horde player, I feel this on a personal level. 
---
"no u"
---
Classic.
---
Instructions unclear, sacrificed own soul.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Talking specifically about PvP here, 
---
Horde racials didn't really matter much. It wasn't until TBC that people started really realizing how much advantage Horde had in Arenas because of broken Undead SL SL Warlocks with Will of the Forsaken and Orcs' stun resist.
---
Vanilla's PvP was mainly World PvP / BG oriented.
---
Paladins were Alliance only. And that meant BOP's on mages who mainly spec'd elemental (frost/fire hybrid) for World PvP. Mages just went in and wiped whole raids.
---
Alliance absolutely dominated Horde on Nostalrius. 
---
&lt;NOPE&gt; was basically every Horde player's nightmare.
---
I'd love the idea of non-transferrable inter-dimensional portals, effectively creating three versions of the game all localized to one account. Probably impossible to implement, but who knows.
---
Don't need gold and gems when you're dead, bro.
---
&gt;!Unless you're a Pharaoh!&lt;
---
Stubbed your toe on a rock and there goes your life as a master jewel thief.
---
#**NO CHANGES**
---
hunters can trap basicly anything tho. And i think stuns work on most types
---
One can hope.

---
Like shopping at the gas station instead of supermarket for something available at both. More "convenient" , and more expensive.
---
Remember to visit weapon trainsers in the 3 big citys when you go there so you can always equip any weapon you find while leaveling
---
They're talking about the time it would take in play time. Assuming the aforementioned 10 days it takes for most experienced players, getting 60 in a month would mean playing 8 hours a day. 
---
In other words, for most people, hitting 60 will take 3-5 months
---
Post-Cata Kalimdor looks so weird with Thousand Needles and Uldum
---
You can name your mage whatever you want, but my mages name will be portalninetysilver, so. 
---
Depends on your client. Should be slightly over mats for lowbies, and 1g for 60s. At least that's the typical going rate for me
---
You can, though. It's the spell is off GCD, you can even macro it into fireball if you feel like it.
---
If you are just advertising ports in a city I would say 50s.  If you get asked for a port I would say 1g for 60s and anywhere from 20s(mat cost) to 50s for lower level players.
---
When classic rolls out my biggest fear is being on a server with faction imbalance to the extreme 
---
1g is pretty standard if you're advertising. If someone asked me how much I would just say the cost of the reagent plus whatever they want to tip. Ended up working out. 
---
It's a pretty boring way to make gold though. 
---
Having that sleep in Sunken Temple runs was amazing.
---
It's known as stranglethorn vietnam for a reason
---
GachiBASS
---
If you think that players from 2005 are as good as players are now, I have nothing to say to you. 
---
I'm not saying flasks werent recognized as good, but more raiders now, per capita, use flasks than they did in 2005. If you disagree, you are objectively wrong. 
---
I loved having a mage alt to port people around. I played Druid in EQ and made a killing selling ports, though eq travel was much more tedious than vanilla wow.
---
Still loved every moment though.
---
After my experience on this server, I’m the exact same way lol. I’m at a point where I may purposely pick a streamers server to try to ensure faction pop lol
---
Why did they have to turn TN into a huge dick...
---
It's not a race - It's a marathon
